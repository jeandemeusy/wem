{"bf740a7bbd7c8bdb0a57ebd4fbdbb072496e334c279af48c470b1a8a": "The UK's ministry of defence has said the failed crossing of the Siverskyi Donets river by Russian forces in the Donbas showed the pressure Russian commanders were under: On Wednesday, Ukrainian forces successfully prevented the crossing, and released images which the MoD said indicated that Russia 'lost significant armoured manoeuvre elements of at least one Battalion Tactical Group'. The pictures showed what Ukraine claimed were destroyed Russian tanks and other armoury in the village of Bilohorivka, near the strategic Ukrainian-held city of Lysychansk. The UK's ministry of defence also said Russia was 'investing significant effort in the vicinity of Izium and Severodonetsk in an attempt to achieve a breakthrough towards Sloviansk and Kramatorsk.' Russia said it expelled 10 Romanian diplomats in response to similar expulsions by Bucharest, its foreign ministry said. In a separate statement, the ministry said a member of the Bulgarian embassy was also being expelled. Germany says it has started training Ukrainian soldiers in the use of the Panzerhaubitze (PzH) 2000 artillery system this week. The PzH 2000 howitzer is one of the most powerful artillery weapons in the Bundeswehr inventories and can hit targets at a distance of 40km (25 miles). The Kremlin's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has been speaking to reporters during his regular briefing. Referring to a report in a Finnish newspaper that Russia may cut gas supplies to Finland as soon as today, Peskov said it was 'most likely' 'another newspaper hoax'.  Iltalehti reported yesterday that Finnish politicians had been warned that Russia could halt gas supplies to its neighbour on Friday. The newspaper cited unnamed sources and did not say where the warning came from. Peskov said there were no plans to cut Finland off from gas supplies today, adding that Gazprom remained a reliable gas supplier, Reuters reports. He also hit back at calls by Poland's prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, to 'root out' Russia's 'monstrous ideology'.  In a column for Britain's Telegraph newspaper on Tuesday, Morawiecki said the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was more dangerous than either Adolf Hitler or Josef Stalin because of the advanced weapons at his disposal. Peskov told reporters: He said Morawiecki's 'shocking' statement was 'hysterical and unacceptable'. Russian president Vladimir Putin held a phone call with German chancellor Olaf Scholz, in which Putin 'outlined in detail the logic and main objectives of the special military operation', the Kremlin said on Friday. According to the Kremlin's readout of the call, Putin also spoke about the 'measures being taken to ensure the safety of civilians' during what the Kremlin calls its 'special military operation' in Ukraine.  The Kremlin further said that Putin drew attention to the 'gross violations' committed by Ukrainian militants 'professing the Nazi ideology'. The Russian leader added that the current Russian-Ukrainian negotiations were 'effectively blocked' by Kyiv. During the conversation, the leaders agreed to hold further talks soon, the Kremlin said. A Russian soldier has appeared in the dock at the first war crime trial of Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine. The defendant, who arrived at Kyiv's small district court No 3 in a grey tracksuit and handcuffs, is Vadim Shysimarin, a 21-year-old commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division, who is in Ukrainian custody charged with murdering a 62-year-old man. It was a preliminary hearing and a first date for trial has been set for 18 May. Shysimarin's lawyer said his client had confessed to the killing of the victim but that he had not yet discussed whether he would plead guilty. Shysimarin spoke briefly to confirm his name and that he understood the charges against him. It is alleged that Shysimarin, a sergeant, had been fighting in the Sumy region in north-east Ukraine when he killed a civilian on 28 February in the village of Chupakhivka. He is accused of shooting at a civilian car after his convoy of military vehicles had come under attack from Ukrainian forces. He then drove the car away with four other soldiers as he sought to flee Ukrainian fighters. Shysimarin shot dead the unarmed man, who was on a bicycle and talking on his phone, after being ordered 'to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders', according to prosecutors. The crime is said to have happened 'dozens of metres' from the victim's house and was committed using an AK-74 rifle. The name of the 62-year-old victim was not made public. Germany's agriculture minister, Cem Ozdemir, described grain theft by Russia in eastern Ukraine as 'repugnant' as G7 countries met to discuss the impact of the war on the global food supply. Ozdemir was speaking to reporters at the start of a meeting in Stuttgart with colleagues from G7 countries, Ukraine, the EU, the OECD and the UN's food and agricultural agency, Reuters reports. Ozdemir said: Russia was 'stealing, robbing, taking for itself grain from eastern Ukraine,' Oezdemir said, describing it as an 'economic war'. Ukraine's agriculture minister, Mykola Solsky, said his country was in a 'very difficult situation' with regard to grain exports, adding: Britain announced its latest round of sanctions targeting the Russian president's financial network, including his ex-wife, family and inner circle. The sanctions are aimed at the 'shady network propping up Putin's luxury lifestyle', British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said in a statement. The 12 new names added to the British sanctions list include the former first lady of the Russian Federation and ex-wife of Putin, Lyudmila Ocheretnaya. Mikhail Shelomov, a Russian business owner and the leader's first cousin, once removed, has also been targeted. Several other relatives of Putin holding executive positions at major Russian firms like Gazprom have also been sanctioned. They face asset freezes and travel bans. Truss' statement read: Putins' official assets are modest, according to the UK Foreign Office, with his lifestyle 'funded by a cabal of family, friends and elites'. Britain's sanctioned list now includes more than 1,000 individuals and 100 entities. Hello, it's Leonie Chao-Fong with you again today.

Leonie Chao-Fong will continue to bring you the latest developments. The first war crime trial since Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine has opened in Kyiv in a watershed moment. Vadim Shysimarin, a 21-year-old Russian commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division, allegedly killed a civilian on 28 February in the village of Chupakhivka while fighting in the Sumy region in north-east Ukraine. Shysimarin, who has been held in Ukrainian custody, is accused of shooting at a civilian car after his convoy of military vehicles came under attack from Ukrainian forces. He then drove the car away with four other soldiers as he sought to flee Ukrainian fighters. Shysimarin shot dead a 62-year-old unarmed man who was on a bicycle and talking on his phone, after being ordered 'to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders', according to prosecutors. The crime is said to have happened 'dozens of metres' from the victim's house and was committed using an AK-74 rifle. A spokesperson for the prosecutor's office said before the trial opened: 'Prosecutors and investigators of the SBU [Ukrainian secret services] have collected enough evidence of his involvement in violation of the laws and customs of war combined with premeditated murder. For these actions, he faces 10 to 15 years in prison or life in prison.' Two other cases are likely to be heard in court within days including an in absentia trial of Mikhail Romanov, a Russian soldier accused of rape and murder. He is accused of breaking into a house in March in a village in the Brovarsky region near Kyiv, murdering a man and then repeatedly raping his wife while 'threatening her and her underage child with violence and weapons'. You can read more of Daniel Boffey's report from Kyiv here: First Russian soldier goes on trial in Ukraine for war crimes Reuters is carrying another quote from Sweden about their moves to consider joining Nato. Defence minister Peter Hultqvist said: 'If Sweden chooses to seek Nato membership, there is a risk of a reaction from Russia. Let me state that, in such a case, we are prepared to deal with any counter-response.' Yesterday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia would 'definitely' consider it a threat if Sweden's neighbours Finland were to join Nato. Swedish membership of Nato would have a stabilising effect and would benefit countries around the Baltic sea, Sweden's foreign minister Ann Linde said today, the day after neighbour Finland committed to applying to join the 30-nation alliance. 'Swedish Nato membership would raise the threshold for military conflicts and thus have a conflict-preventing effect in northern Europe,' Linde told reporters when presenting a parliament report on security, Reuters reports. Sweden is widely expected to follow Finland's lead and media reports have suggested Stockholm could apply for Nato membership as early as Monday. Ukrainian military forces released footage on Thursday that they say shows destroyed Russian military vehicles and a pontoon bridge in eastern Ukraine. According to the Ukrainian forces, the images were taken along the Siverskyi Donets River. The UK's Ministry of Defence said on Friday the failed crossing of the river by Russian forces showed the pressure Russian commanders were under. The ministry's intelligence update said the images suggested that Russia 'lost armoured manoeuvre elements of at least one battalion tactical group' at the river, located west of Severodonetsk. While G7 foreign ministers have been meeting in Germany, Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has been meeting his counterpart from Belarus. Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has just posted a video clip of an interview conducted with Rai 1 in Italy. Overnight he posted to Telegram in English, saying: Russia's defence ministry has claimed its forces struck the Kremenchug oil refinery in central Ukraine, destroying its production capacity and fuel tanks. Reuters reports the ministry also said its forces shot down a Ukrainian Su-27 aircraft in Kharkiv region. The reports have not been independently verified. Kharkiv governor Oleh Synyehubov has provided an update on the situation in his region on Telegram, saying 'the night was relatively calm'. He said that a rocket had hit 'the territory of Kharkiv airport', but that no one was injured. He listed a small number of injuries and fatalities in Saltivka, Dergachi, Zolochiv, Balaklia and Shebelinka. He said that in Dergachi 'the Russians damaged the humanitarian headquarters, the registry office, part of the clinic, and the ambulance building', and that in Shebelinka 'a Russian shell hit a hangar building. The roof of the hangar and 10 trucks were on fire. Unfortunately, three people died and 5 others were injured.' He added: None of the claims have been independently verified. A quick snap from Reuters here that the EU's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, has said this morning that the European Union would provide another EUR500m (PS425m) worth of military support to Ukraine, and that he was confident a deal could be reached in the coming days to agree an embargo on Russian oil.", "c338a41fc538cb7889a06289d4c644aeef1f8f2654cb7905a75cff2e": "A court in Kyiv will hear the first war crime trial since Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine, while the Kremlin bristled at Finland seeking to join Nato and Sweden moving to follow suit. In a watershed moment, a Russian soldier will be accused of murdering a 62-year-old civilian when he appears in the dock on Friday, with the case coming as the number of crimes registered by Ukraine's general prosecutor surpassed 11,000 and Unicef reported that at least 100 children had been killed in the war in April alone. The defendant who will appear at Kyiv's district court is Vadim Shysimarin, a 21-year-old commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division, who is currently in Ukrainian custody. It is alleged Shysimarin, a sergeant, had been fighting in the Sumy region in north-east Ukraine when he killed a civilian on 28 February in the village of Chupakhivka. He is accused of shooting at a civilian car after his convoy of military vehicles had come under attack from Ukrainian forces. He then drove the car away with four other soldiers as he sought to flee Ukrainian fighters. Shysimarin shot dead the unarmed man, who was on a bicycle and talking on his phone, after being ordered 'to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders', according to prosecutors. The crime is said to have happened 'dozens of metres' from the victim's house and was committed using an AK-74 rifle. The case was this week filed at a criminal court. 'He is here [in Ukraine], we have him,' said Ukraine's prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, from her heavily fortified headquarters in Kyiv on Tuesday. A spokesperson for the prosecutor's office said: 'Prosecutors and investigators of the SBU [Ukrainian secret services] have collected enough evidence of his involvement in violation of the laws and customs of war combined with premeditated murder. For these actions, he faces 10 to 15 years in prison or life in prison.'

He is accused of breaking into a house in March in a village in the Brovarsky region near Kyiv, murdering a man and then repeatedly raping his wife while 'threatening her and her underage child with violence and weapons'. The trial is another propaganda triumph for Kyiv and another diplomatic move increasing pressure on Vladimir Putin with Finland's plan to apply for Nato membership, and the expectation that Sweden will follow. Moscow called Finland's announcement hostile and threatened retaliation, including unspecified 'military-technical' measures. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the Finns would be 'warmly welcomed' and promised a 'smooth and swift' accession process. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said: 'We would support a Nato application by Finland and-or Sweden should they apply.' Britain's foreign secretary, Liz Truss has urged a meeting of G7 foreign ministers to equip Ukraine to Nato standards and maintain sanctions against Russia until it has fully withdrawn. The BBC reported that Truss told the meeting in Germany: '[Vladimir] Putin is humiliating himself on the world stage. We must ensure he faces a defeat in Ukraine that denies him any benefit and ultimately constrains further aggression. 'The best long-term security for Ukraine will come from it being able to defend itself. That means providing Ukraine with a clear pathway to Nato-standard equipment.' Elsewhere, Ukraine has claimed that it has damaged a Russian navy logistics ship near Snake Island in the Black Sea, as the Kremlin bristled at Finland seeking to join Nato and Sweden moving to follow suit. 'Thanks to the actions of our naval seamen, the support vessel Vsevolod Bobrov caught fire - it is one of the newest in the Russian fleet,' said Serhiy Bratchuk, a spokesman for the Odesa regional military administration. Satellite imagery provided by Maxar, a private US-based company, showed the aftermath of what it said were probable missile attacks on a Russian Serna-class landing craft near the island, close to Ukraine's sea border with Romania. Maxar images also showed recent damage to buildings on the island. Russia's defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Renewed fighting around Snake Island in recent days may become a battle for control of the western Black Sea coast, according to some defence officials, as Russian forces struggle to make headway in Ukraine's north and east. Ukrainian forces are reported to have driven Russian troops out of the region around the second-largest city, Kharkiv. The Reuters news agency said its journalists had confirmed Ukraine was in control of territory stretching to the banks of the Siverskiy Donets river, around 40km (25 miles) east of Kharkiv. Regional authorities reported ongoing missile strikes around Poltava and shelling at Dergach, near Kharkiv, that killed two people. Russia's army said it struck Donetsk and Kharkiv on Thursday, killing more than 170 people and destroying Ukrainian drones and rockets. Fighting has continued in Ukraine's south and east. Ukraine's presidency said shelling continued throughout Lugansk - part of the Donbas region where Ukrainian forces are fighting Russian armour and Kremlin-backed separatists. Zelensky said in his Thursday address to the nation that Russian forces had destroyed 570 health care facilities in the country, including 101 hospitals. 'What for? It's nonsense. It's barbarity.' In the north-eastern region of Chernihiv, three people were killed and 12 others wounded on Thursday in a strike on a school in Novgorod-Siversky, the emergency services said. Iryna Vereshchuk, a Ukrainian deputy prime minister, said 'difficult talks' were under way over the evacuation of 38 seriously wounded troops from the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. 'We have started a new round of negotiations around a road map for an [evacuation] operation. And we will start with those who are badly wounded,' she told 1+1 television. Disputes have intensified over Russian supplies of energy to Europe - still Moscow's biggest source of funds and Europe's biggest source of heat and power. Moscow said it would halt gas flows to Germany through the main pipeline over Poland, while Kyiv said it would not reopen a pipeline route it shut this week unless it regains control of areas from pro-Russian fighters. Prices for gas in Europe surged.", "ec29b4cdc0bbe72ef1cad44f82ddbf716797cbdf3900446a0f1eb452": "When the soldiers of an elite Russian army brigade were told in early April to prepare for a second deployment to Ukraine, fear broke out among the ranks.  The unit, stationed in Russia's far east during peacetime, first entered Ukraine from Belarus when the war started at the end of February and saw bitter combat with Ukrainian forces. 'It soon became clear that not everyone was onboard with it. Many of us simply did not want to go back,' said Dmitri, a member of the unit who asked not to be identified with his real name. 'I want to return to my family - and not in a casket.' Along with eight others, Dmitri told his commanders that he refused to rejoin the invasion. 'They were furious. But they eventually calmed down because there wasn't much they could do,' he said. He was soon transferred to Belgorod, a Russian city close to the border with Ukraine, where he has been stationed since. 'I have served for five years in the army. My contract ends in June. I will serve my remaining time and then I am out of here,' he said. 'I have nothing to be ashamed of. We aren't officially in a state of war, so they could not force me to go.' Dmitri's refusal to fight highlights some of the military difficulties the Russian army has faced as a result of the Kremlin's political decision not to formally declare war on Ukraine - preferring instead to describe the invasion, which will soon reach its fourth month, as a 'special military operation'. Under Russian military rules, troops who refuse to fight in Ukraine can face dismissal but cannot be prosecuted, said Mikhail Benyash, a lawyer who has been advising soldiers who choose that option. Benyash said 'hundreds and hundreds' of soldiers had been in touch with his team for advice on how they could avoid being sent to fight. Among them were 12 national guardsmen from Russia's southern city of Krasnodar who were fired after refusing to go to Ukraine. 'Commanders try to threaten their soldiers with prison time if they dissent, but we tell the soldiers that they can simply say no,' Benyash said, adding that he was not aware of any criminal cases against soldiers who refused to fight. 'There are no legal grounds to start a criminal case if a soldier refuses to fight while on Russian territory.' Many soldiers, therefore, have chosen to be fired or transferred rather than going into 'the meat grinder', he said. A similar account to Dmitri's was given to the BBC's Russian service by Sergey Bokov, a 23-year-old soldier who at the end of April decided to leave the army after fighting in Ukraine. 'Our commanders didn't even argue with us because we were not the first ones to leave,' Bokov said. Pointing to Russia's military laws, Benyash said it would be more difficult for soldiers to refuse to fight if Russia were to declare a full-scale war. 'During wartime, rules are totally different. Refusal then would mean much harsher penalties. They would be looking at time in prison.' While the exact number of soldiers refusing to fight remains unclear, such stories illustrate what military experts and western governments say is one of Russia's biggest obstacles in Ukraine: a severe shortage of infantry soldiers. Moscow initially put about 80% of its main ground combat forces - 150,000 men - into the war in February, according to western officials. But significant damage has been done to that army, which has confronted logistical problems, poor morale and an underestimated Ukrainian resistance. 'Putin needs to make a decision regarding mobilisation in the coming weeks,' said Rob Lee, a military analyst. 'Russia lacks sufficient ground units with contract soldiers for a sustainable rotation. The troops are getting exhausted - they won't be able to keep this up for a long period.' Lee said one option for the Kremlin would be to authorise the deployment of conscript units to Ukraine, despite Putin's earlier pledges that Russia would not use any conscripts in the war. 'Conscripts could fill some of the gaps, but they will be poorly trained. Many of the units that are supposed to train conscripts are fighting themselves,' Lee said. But without conscript battalions, Russia could soon 'struggle to hold the territory it currently controls in Ukraine, especially as Ukraine receives better equipment from Nato,' he said. Russian authorities quietly stepped up their efforts to recruit new soldiers as it became clear that a quick victory in Ukraine was unattainable. An investigation by the BBC's Russian service showed that Russia's defence ministry filled employment websites with vacancies, offering people with no combat experience opportunities to join the army on lucrative short-term contracts. Some large government-run companies have received letters urging them to sign up their staff for the army. Russia has also turned to mercenaries to bolster its war efforts, deploying fighters from the shadowy Kremlin-linked Wagner group. But analysts say voluntary recruits and mercenary groups are unlikely to lead to a substantial increase in the number of new soldiers, compared with the numbers that a partial or a full-scale mobilisation would bring. Despite speculation beforehand, Putin did not formally declare war on Ukraine during his Victory Day speech on 9 May. Andrei Kolesnikov, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment, said the authorities may be worried that a general mobilisation would antagonise large sections of the population that support the 'special operation'. Russians 'might be in favour of the conflict, but they don't actually want to fight,' he said, adding that a general mobilisation would entail 'colossal losses of untrained soldiers'. And while the current status of the conflict gives Russian soldiers a legal path to refuse participation, some soldiers have complained that it has also led to them not being adequately cared for. A junior sergeant said he was injured during one of the recent Ukrainian attacks on the Russian border territory where he was stationed. His superiors argued that he should not be given the monetary compensation of up to PS2,500 that wounded Russians are entitled to by law because his injury took place on Russian soil - meaning it did not fall under the rules of Russia's 'special military operation'. 'It is unfair, I am fighting in this war just as the others in Ukraine, risking my life,' the soldier said. 'If I don't get the compensation that I am entitled to soon, I will go public and make a major issue of it.'", "fab99b3f401a2321af6864a860d7e6795ebd349f9689bbe178b47b75": "The top Democrat and Republican in the US Senate joined forces in a rare moment of unity on Thursday in an attempt to pass $40bn in aid for Ukraine, only to be stymied by a single Republican lawmaker: the Kentucky libertarian Rand Paul. Faced with the prospect of an extended delay for the package that passed the House of Representatives on Tuesday, the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, and his Republican counterpart, Mitch McConnell, sought to move forward on the aid package only to be blocked by Paul, a fiscal hawk who objects to the amount of spending proposed. The stalemate delayed passage of the measure into next week. The Senate has scheduled an initial procedural vote on the bill for late Monday afternoon. It was unclear whether that vote would then speed passage of the Ukraine aid. Alternatively, passage could come around the middle of next week if any senator wants to force a series of legislative steps before a final vote. As the Ukraine aid bill became caught in the Senate's procedural gears, Schumer pleaded for fast action: 'The package is ready to go, the vast majority of senators on both sides of the aisle want it.' He added: 'If Senator Paul persists in his reckless demands ... all he will accomplish is to single-handedly delay desperately needed Ukraine aid.' But Paul was not moved. The delay into next week could cause problems for western countries trying to bolster Ukraine in its fight against Russia. The Biden administration has said that by 19 May it expects to run out of available funds to draw on under an authority that allows the president to authorize the transfer of weapons without congressional approval in response to an emergency. Paul is demanding that the legislation be altered to require an inspector general to oversee spending on Ukraine. Without his agreement, the Senate must follow a lengthy process stipulated by the chamber's arcane rules. McConnell, Paul's fellow senator from Kentucky, weighed in, saying: 'Ukraine is not asking us to fight this war. They're only asking for the resources they need to defend themselves against this deranged invasion. And they need this help right now.' The House passed the Ukraine spending bill by 368 to 57, with only Republicans voting against it. Joe Biden had asked Congress to approve an additional $33bn in aid for Ukraine. But lawmakers decided to increase the military and humanitarian funding. 'This is the second spending bill for Ukraine in two months. And this bill is three times larger than the first,' Paul said before formally blocking the aid package. 'Congress just wants to keep on spending, and spending.' The aid package had previously included more spending for dealing with Covid-19 in the US, but the two causes were decoupled after Republicans balked. Meanwhile, the White House Covid-19 coordinator, Ashish Jha, issued a dire warning that the US will be increasingly vulnerable to the coronavirus this fall and winter if Congress does not swiftly approve new funding for more vaccines and treatments. In an Associated Press interview, Jha said Americans' immune protection from the virus was waning, the virus was adapting to be more contagious and booster doses for most people would be necessary, with the potential for enhanced protection from a new generation of shots. His warning came as the White House said there could be up to 100m infections from the virus later this year and as Biden somberly ordered flags to half-staff to mark the imminent milestone of 1 million US Covid deaths.", "3809f4e627be47370c245bbe8fd4c02c485f5fa5606e013f811e63c2": "The aim was to be the invisible man, says Igor Pedin, 61. It was to drift, as if a ghost, with his small trolley bag of supplies and dog Zhu-Zhu, a nine-year-old mongrel terrier, through the hellscape of the besieged port city of Mariupol, out into the badlands of Russian-occupied territories and on to the relative safety of the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia - a mere 225km walk away. The equivalent of walking by foot from London to Sheffield but through a war unseen in its scale in Europe since 1945 and towards the oncoming convoys of tanks, armoured vehicles and nervous trigger-happy Russian soldiers racing towards Mariupol; it meant sidestepping mines and crossing destroyed bridges with his dog and luggage, where an erring step would lead to a 30ft drop to certain death; he would have to pass the smouldering homes and weeping men and women with their heartbreaking stories of death and suffering and their loss of will to live on. Pedin, a former ship's cook, could not have known any of this - and he did not prove to be invisible, he concedes, as he recounts his tale in the safety of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Indeed, such would be his extraordinary feat that on one remarkable night Russian soldiers at one of the many checkpoints he would pass through gathered in the quiet of the evening to hear his story, stuffing cigarettes into his pockets for the onward journey and wishing him luck. He may not have been invisible, Pedin repeats, the tears welling in a rare moment of emotion. But he was, he adds, lucky. Pedin's final decision to leave Mariupol was made on 20 April, he recalls, when the Russian soldiers had reached his part of the city and were going house to house, shooting at will. There was already little left to stay for; there was scant food or water, the dead were piling up in the streets. Pedin prepared meticulously. He packed a bag, weighed it and challenged himself to reduce the initial 70-kilo weight to 50.  The initial task for Pedin and Zhu-Zhu was to traverse the five kilometres to the city outskirts, an aim that he had little faith could be achieved. He left his home on Tkochenko-Petrenko street near Mariupol's port at 6am on 23 April and it took two hours to stumble through the craters, twisted steel and unexploded ordnance, north up Kyprino Street, where dead bodies were strewn, and on to the Port City shopping mall. Russian soldiers were handing out food and water at the end of long queues of desperate ashen-faced people. He stole by the crowds, avoiding eye contact with the soldiers, and walked up Zaporizhzhia Road. 'I looked like a vagabond to them, I was nothing. I was dirty and covered from dust, as my house had been filled with a fog of smoke. I walked out of the city by this motorway and at the top I turned around. I looked back down at the city and I said to myself, it was the right decision. I said goodbye. There was an explosion. I turned and walked on.' He walked by burnt-out military vehicles, just his dog and the noise of shelling behind him until a convoy of armoured vehicles, so heavy they made the asphalt under his feet tremble, swept past. He crouched down, taking Zhu-Zhu, terrified, into his coat, until they passed. 'I was an invisible man then,' he recalls. 'What am I to them: who is this shadow?' His aim was the town of Nikolske, 20km away. By the time he reached the first houses, it was getting dark and very cold. 'I saw a man ahead outside his house. He said, 'Young man would you like to drink with me. Today I buried my son. Let's drink to my son.'' Pedin gave up drinking 15 years ago but he could not refuse. He had two shots of vodka, while his new friend emptied the bottle. 'He told me that Russians had killed his 16-year-old son on 3 March in Mariupol. Shrapnel had taken off his head. After he had disappeared he spent weeks looking for him in Mariupol. He found the grave, and Russian soldiers said he would have to dig him up with his hands if he wanted the body. He told me, 'I want to die - I will kill myself.'' Pedin slept on the couch that night, waking at 6am. He knew the only way out towards Zaporizhzhia was through the town. 'As I left the town there was a checkpoint: Chechens. They had seen me and two of them came towards me. 'Where are you going? Where have you come from,' they asked. 'Have you been through the filtration camp.'' A commander appeared and called someone on a radio. 'A minivan turned up and three big men came out and I was put in the van. We drove 2km back to Nikolske and came to a two-storey council building, which they had surrounded with steel fencing. There were about 40 people waiting in the grounds but the van drove to the building entrance.' Pedin left his bag outside and tied up Zhu-Zhu before being taken to the second floor. 'A Russian officer sat in front of a desk asked me where I was going. I lied. I said I had a stomach ulcer and needed to get to Zaporizhzhia as I had paid for treatment. I was told to take off my top and they looked for tattoos. I had a bruise on my shoulder and they accused me of having had a rifle. He demanded, 'where are your tattoos?' He said, 'You are boring me. Maybe I should beat you?' I said, 'As you wish, commander.' But I was taken to another room where there were four military women with PCs, and they scanned my fingerprints, put me up against a wall and took mugshots.' He was given a document from the so-called ministry of internal affairs of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic. He was free to leave and set off again with his dog and bag to the checkpoint. 'The Chechens said they would get the next car to take me to the next village at Rozivka. I was there for two hours. They were bored and talked to me, giving me cigarettes. None of the drivers would take me, so I said, guys, I will just walk. One said, 'No, this is my authority', pointing at his gun.' After an hour, a black minivan pulled up and the Chechens demanded that the driver, who was travelling with his wife and two daughters, aged about 18 and 20, take Pedin. 'No one said a word. They took me to Rozivka. On the way, I noticed in the fields large diggers digging up holes. And further down there were crosses. I am sure they were mass graves.' On arrival at Rozivka, Pedin walked down Lenina street out of town and came to another checkpoint which he passed easily with his new document and kept on walking. By the time he came to the next village, Verzhyna, it was pitch black. 'Suddenly flashlights blinded me. There were six soldiers, they barked at me, I put up my hands. They told me to take my top off, emptied my bag. It was freezing. They ordered me to follow them. We went inside the House of Culture [a community centre] which was their headquarters.' Pedin was given some canned beef and some soup and put in a small room that had a steel bed in the corner. He was told that if he left earlier than the morning that he would be shot - but was free to go the following day. He crept past the sleeping soldiers in the morning and nodded to one on watch as he left. He walked for 14 hours that day reaching another checkpoint at around 8pm to be searched again. The soldiers pointed him towards a small abandoned house where he could sleep. But he was off again at 6am as the sun rose. 'I saw a big man in his 60s. He asked, 'Where are you from?' I said Mariupol, and he called to his wife to bring food. They gave me a bag of bread, onion, fried pork, cucumber. They insisted. And I walked on.' By now, Pedin was exhausted and yet the greatest obstacle was to come. The road bridge he needed to pass over had been destroyed, leaving a 30-metre sheer drop on to railway tracks below. 'You can cheat people but not a destroyed bridge.' The bridge's metal frame was still in place, however, with two beams: one narrow one below and one broader one at shoulder height. Pedin tied up his dog with his bag and tested the crossing. It was doable. He went back and crossed again with his bag. Then he returned and took his dog, who walked on the beam above, with Pedin holding the lead. 'I just shouted, 'We did it.'' They approached the next checkpoint. The soldier demanded to know where my companion was. 'I said I only had my dog. Then they wanted to know how I had crossed the bridge.' Pedin was told he could stay the night in the back half of a radio van that had been hit by a Ukrainian shell at the front. It was dark now. Pedin's story was exactly the sort of diversion the bored soldiers needed. Five gathered around him, to hear of his adventures, and daring deeds across the bridge. 'One wanted to keep in touch, he was saying that after the war I should stay with him. There was nothing for me to say.' Pedin slept in his chair, with Zhu-Zhu under his coat. The next morning, he was told he was not allowed to carry on via the road to Zaporizhzhia but had to choose to go back or south to the city of Tokmak. Pedin headed towards the city but faced two big hills. 'The dog just couldn't go on. I had to walk up the road with my bag, and then come back for him and carry him up. I said, 'If you don't walk we will both die, you have to walk.' He walked up the next hill.' Off the road was Tarasivka, a small village. 'I saw the top of the head of a man in a window and called to him. I gave him some of the soldiers' cigarettes, I even had menthol cigarettes. The only way to Zaporizhzhia was on small roads and over a dam and then to take what he said was the smugglers' track.' He did as he was instructed. But after the dam, there was a crossroads - and no indication of which way to go. Pedin's luck struck again. 'A truck appeared. I called out. I said, 'I am from Mariupol.' The door opened. We drove for two hours, through weaving roads. I would have never have found my way. We said nothing. At the checkpoints, this man said just two words to the Donetsk People's Republic militia and he was let through.' Pedin saw a Ukrainian flag ahead, where soldiers checked the men's documents and let them go. 'The driver dropped me in central Zaporizhzhia by a tent. He had said nothing on the journey but gave me 1,000 hryvnia (PS30). He said good luck. He understood everything - what was there to say?' Pedin walked into the tent, full of volunteers. He was asked by a woman whether he needed help. He went quiet and then said yes.  'The lady asked, 'where have you come from?' I said, 'I have come from Mariupol.' She screamed: 'Mariupol!'' Pedin recalls with a smile. 'She shouted out to everyone, this man has come from Mariupol on foot. Everyone stopped. I suppose it was my moment of glory.'", "8d171332a29b49ff5954891f4503b435aa78861f77ee162c083f95ec": "In the days after Vladimir Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine in late February, Vladimir Shurupov, a cardiologist from the Siberian city of Tomsk, felt he could not breathe properly. 'I was having panic attacks, I could not eat or sleep. I just knew I had to remove myself from this place, from this atmosphere,' he said. Shurupov, 40, had been a quiet critic of Putin's government for years, but he had never attended a protest of any kind, fearful of unwanted attention or arrest. When the war began, disgust with the regime combined with a fear he would be sent to the front. 'If there was mobilisation, I would have been called up as a military doctor, and this is not a war I would be willing to fight in,' he said. Shurupov discussed with his wife and two sons that perhaps they should try to leave the country. The family had minimal savings but he was able to sell his car for cash and buy four tickets to Yerevan, the capital of Armenia. Just two days after first discussing leaving, they flew out of Tomsk to Yerevan. After receiving Schengen visas, they moved on to Bulgaria. They have no plans ever to return home. The Shurupov family are among hundreds of thousands of Russians to have fled the country since the war began on 24 February. Putin has referred to such people as 'traitors and scum' and said their departure will help 'cleanse' Russian society. Many are opposition journalists or activists, whose work has in effect been criminalised under increasingly draconian wartime laws in Russia. Others are businesspeople fleeing sanctions. Some simply did not want to be part of a society where pro-war feelings are running so high. Shurupov estimated that of 30 colleagues at his hospital, only three were opposed to the war. Some of those who left in the days after the invasion have already decided to return, but many are set on making a new life abroad, at least until there are political changes in Russia. 'I don't want to live behind a new iron curtain. I just had a feeling that there was no future in Russia,' said Valery Zolotukhin, 39, a literary and theatre scholar who came to Armenia with his wife and seven-year-old daughter. 'In Russia, you're living inside the fantasy of a few people ... They've created an imaginary world and you're forced to be part of it.' A century ago, after the Bolsheviks took over Russia, millions of emigres fled to Istanbul, Prague and Harbin. Today there is an echo of that process as the cafes of Vilnius, Tbilisi and Yerevan are packed with Russians in the first stages of building a new life. Armenia is one of the most popular destinations, because no visa is required. It has also created favourable conditions for IT businesses, prompting the relocation of thousands of Russian tech professionals over the past two months. 'At the beginning, you walked down the street and saw all your friends from Moscow, and the people from St Petersburg and Nizhny Novgorod you only normally see on Zoom calls,' said Maya Gorodova, a former commercial director at Russian startups, who has set up a coworking space in Yerevan with views to Mount Ararat from the windows. All 70 current tenants are recent arrivals from Russia, and Gorodova has received calls from Russians in Belgrade, Tbilisi, Tel Aviv and Bali, she said, asking for advice on setting up new work spaces for emigres. The outflow of tech professionals is likely to be a huge blow for Russia, which in recent years has become a highly digitised economy. But opposition to the war, a fear of possible mobilisation and the loss of contracts with foreign clients due to sanctions have combined to push many to the exit. At Hummus Kimchi, a new restaurant run by a brother and sister team transplanted from Moscow, recent arrivals to Yerevan discuss their next moves. Some have their eye on Britain's Global Talent visa and have paid thousands of pounds to agents who promise to craft their forms to match the Home Office's checklist. Others note that Germany offers citizenship within five years for arriving IT specialists. 'Of course these are all reserve options,' said one young tech professional, sipping a craft beer. 'Hopefully, Putin will die soon and we can all go back.' For many who have left, emigration was the final moment in a life of gritty opposition activity, including arrests and house searches. For others it was the start of a political awakening. One woman in her 30s, who did not want her name published, said she had always opposed Putin but had been too fearful to attend protests or post on Facebook. On the second day of the war she wore clothes in Ukrainian colours to work, and her colleagues began insulting her. She realised nobody in her social group shared her revulsion over the invasion. 'It's impossible to talk to any of my friends, I started chats with a few of them and it feels like they are just pressing control C, control V. They're all repeating the same phrases,' she said. She also left behind a long-term boyfriend who works in Russia's security services. Previously they had not discussed politics much, but before departing she wrote him a long letter setting out her opposition to the war. They have hardly spoken since. 'In a short time here I met more people who think like me than I did in the last few years in Moscow. And I realised that here I've stopped always calculating what I should say based on who I'm talking to. I feel so much freer,' she said. Many Russians in Yerevan spend long hours in the city's cafes and bars, philosophising about whether there was any way to have stopped Putin earlier, and whether they should have done more. Some remain worried about repercussions at home and speak in mealy mouthed euphemisms about 'the unfortunate events' or 'the Ukrainian situation'. Others are eager to express their wholehearted support for Ukraine. In Moscow, Elena Kamay ran Lambada Markets, which put on street markets beloved by the city's so-called 'creative class' that has sprung up over the past decade. Stalls sold vintage clothing, items by local designers and other artisan objects. 'Of course it was all a facade, we lived in a bubble. And now it's all over,' she said. Kamay moved to Yerevan at the beginning of March, and like many has been thinking back over the past decade from today's vantage point. She accepted that working in Moscow had involved 'doing a deal with your conscience', though she said she had been attending anti-government protests since 2011. Recently, she said, she had been rereading messages she had exchanged with Oksana Baulina, a Russian activist and journalist who left Russia two years ago and was killed by a Russian airstrike in Kyiv in March while reporting. 'I always thought she was exaggerating a bit when she described her views about Russia and the political system, but it turns out she was right all along,' she said. Elena Chegodayeva also arrived in Yerevan in March, and a few weeks later set up a school from an apartment in the city centre. The 50 pupils and 20 teachers have all recently arrived from Russia. Chegodayeva said she had been pondering the concept of collective responsibility since the war started. 'We are all Russians and we will have to take responsibility for this, just like Germans had to after the war,' she said. 'On the other hand, I was two years old when Putin was elected, so it's not entirely clear what more I could have done.' Chegodayeva, 24, said she had lost part of her university stipend for arguing with her professor about whether the annexation of Crimea was illegal, and received dawn visits to her apartment from police after taking part in protests. She said the case of a St Petersburg artist who faces 10 years in jail for replacing supermarket price tags with anti-war slogans showed protest in Russia now was futile. She will only return to Russia 'if there is revolution in the air', she said. Rather than try to persuade people to stay, Putin has celebrated the outflow of hundreds of thousands of educated, anti-war Russians. In a sinister video address in the middle of March, Putin criticised those who moved abroad or supported the west in its current battle with Moscow. 'Any people, and particularly the Russian people, are able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors, and simply spit them out like a fly that flew into their mouths,' he said, using some of the harshest language of his two decades in charge. There would be a 'natural and necessary cleansing of society', said Putin, which would be beneficial to the country in the long run. The question now is whether those who have left will gradually disconnect themselves from Russia, or form a powerful opposition to Putin and his regime from outside, rallying around political forces such as associates of the jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who are mostly now based in Vilnius. 'For 100 years, the understanding of emigration was that people quickly lost touch with Russia and didn't understand it, so nobody believed the political emigration might have a chance of playing a role in Russian politics,' said Andrei Soldatov, a co-author with Irina Borogan of a recent book about the history of Russians outside Russia. Now, however, the internet opens up very different possibilities. 'The country is still connected to the world. So many Russian journalists left the country and still have contact with their audiences, and this is an absolutely new development for the Kremlin,' Soldatov said. Before trying to change the regime, many of the emigres are first focused on trying to change the mind of war-supporting family members who have stayed behind, refusing to leave. Shurupov hopes his mother will eventually join the family in Europe, but so far she is resisting. 'I haven't been able to convince her about the war, and she doesn't want to leave. For me, this is a real tragedy.'", "3b8bd5c23c4d65a9b35754a1521daa0e3b11b8cdd85a3239341c75ea": "", "37dda19998526b17bbce2ff941a69938d94d87477d28cbe17324aabb": "Finland and Sweden could apply for membership of the 30-nation Nato alliance within days, ending decades of military non-alignment in a historic shift triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Here is a brief look at the background and implications of their decisions. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is a defensive military alliance formed in 1949 by 12 countries including the US, UK and France to counter the threat of postwar Soviet Russian expansion in Europe. Its common security guarantee is based on article 5 of the treaty, which states that an attack on one member is an attack on all and commits members to defend each other in the event of armed aggression.  Both considered that joining the alliance would represent an unnecessary provocation of Moscow, and so have long pursued policies of neutrality, and then non-alignment, to avoid antagonising a major regional power. Finland's concerns have been largely practical: it shares an 810-mile (1,300km) border with Russia, declared independence in 1917 after more than a century of rule by Moscow, and its army twice fought off Soviet forces during the second world war before ceding about 10% of its territory. A 1948 agreement of friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance with Russia isolated Finland militarily from western Europe, though the breakup of the Soviet Union and EU membership have since allowed it to step out of Russia's shadow. Sweden's opposition to Nato membership has been more ideological. Its postwar foreign policy has focused on multilateral dialogue and nuclear disarmament and it has long seen itself as a mediator on the international stage, running down its military after the end of the cold war. It has reintroduced conscription and boosted defence spending since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, but many on the Swedish left remain suspicious of the US-led Nato's agenda and argue that Nato membership will only increase regional tensions. Finland's prime minister, Sanna Marin, and her Swedish counterpart, Magdalena Andersson, said last month that Russia's invasion of Ukraine had 'changed Europe's whole security landscape' and 'dramatically shaped mindsets' in the Nordic region. Essentially, many Finns and Swedes increasingly feel that joining Nato will help keep them safe when they face a plainly belligerent and unpredictable Russian leader. Polls show public support for Nato membership has trebled to about 75% in Finland and surged to about 60% in Sweden. Nato membership would mean that for the first time Finland and Sweden would have security guarantees from nuclear states. Both countries switched from formal neutrality to military non-alignment in 1995 when they joined the EU. They are already Nato partners, taking part in exercises and exchanging intelligence with the alliance. Finland already meets Nato's defence spending target of 2% of GDP, while Sweden is on course to do so. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said they would be welcomed 'with open arms' if they do apply and that the accession process would be quick, although formal ratification by all the alliance's members could take several months. From the military perspective, the addition of Finland's and Sweden's armed forces would represent a major boost to Nato's assets in northern Europe, filling a hole in the alliance's defences by doubling the length of its border with Russia and improving security and stability in the Baltic region. Russia has repeatedly warned Finland and Sweden against joining Nato, saying the 'serious military and political consequences' of such a move would oblige it to take 'retaliatory steps' to 'restore military balance' by strengthening its defences in the Baltic, including by deploying nuclear weapons. Vladimir Putin sees Nato not as a defensive alliance but as a threat to Russia's security. He blames Nato for blocking his takeover of Ukraine and has demanded Nato troops be withdrawn from eastern Europe. It is unclear how he would respond if he considers the alliance's expansion in northern Europe an existential danger. Finland's president, prime minister and senior cabinet ministers will meet on Sunday to make a formal decision on submitting an application. A positive decision would then be presented to parliament for approval early next week. Sweden's ruling Social Democrats have been split on the issue and are holding an internal consultation, with a decision also due on Sunday. The party is widely expected to back membership, giving an overwhelming majority of MPs in favour. Swedish media have said a final government decision will be made on Monday, with a formal application for membership to be submitted shortly afterwards. Many analysts believe the two countries will apply simultaneously.", "c658172002d777a29727621d82280fbab11c3621850aa31bf99b2b5c": "North Korea has announced its first Covid-19 death amid an 'explosive' outbreak of fever, state media said on Friday, one day after the regime admitted for the first time that it was tackling a coronavirus outbreak. The official KCNA news agency said six people had died, adding that one of them had tested positive for the highly transmissible Omicron variant. It said 187,800 people were being 'isolated and treated' after a fever of unidentified origin spread in the country since late April. About 350,000 people had shown signs of fever, including 18,000 who newly reported such symptoms on Tuesday alone, KCNA said, adding that 162,200 of them treated so far. The news agency did not specify how many had tested positive for Covid-19. Confirmation of North Korea's first Covid-19 death came after the regime said it was imposing 'maximum emergency measures' to address an outbreak in the capital, Pyongyang. Experts believe none - or very few - of the country's 26 million people have been vaccinated, and there are growing fears that a significant outbreak would quickly overwhelm the country's poorly equipped health services North Korea has so far shunned offers of Covid vaccines from China and Russia, and via the World Health Organization's Covax scheme, apparently because administering the jabs would require outside monitoring. Zhao Lijian, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, said Beijing had offered North Korea help in dealing with the outbreak. The US has no immediate plans to share Covid-19 vaccines with North Korea, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Thursday. Lina Yoon, senior Korea researcher at Human Rights Watch, said the regime's admission that the virus was spreading was 'extremely concerning'. 'Most North Koreans are chronically malnourished and unvaccinated, there are barely any medicines left in the country, and the health infrastructure is incapable to deal with this pandemic,' Yoon said. 'The international community should offer medicine for Covid-19 related symptoms, Covid-19 anti-viral medicines, and provide vaccines and all necessary infrastructure for vaccine preservation, including fridges, generators and gasoline.' The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, ordered a nationwide lockdown on Thursday, calling the outbreak the 'gravest national emergency'. But it wasn't clear how strictly the measures were being enforced. An Associated Press photographer on the South Korean side of the border reported seeing dozens of people working in fields or walking on footpaths at a North Korean border town - an indication that the lockdown doesn't require people to stay home or that it exempts farm workers. On Friday, Kim - who on Thursday had been photographed briefly wearing a mask - visited the state emergency epidemic prevention headquarters and 'learned about the nationwide spread of Covid-19',' KCNA said. 'It is the most important challenge and supreme tasks facing our party to reverse the immediate public health crisis situation at an early date,' it added. North Korea had insisted it had not recorded a single Covid case since it closed its borders at the start of the pandemic more than two years ago. That move cut off trade with China and inflicted more damage on an economy already battered by natural disaster and UN sanctions imposed in response to its nuclear and missile tests. While some experts said North Korea's public acknowledgment of Covid cases and deaths could indicate it was seeking outside help, it continued to defy international sanctions with the launch on Friday of what appeared to be three ballistic missiles towards the sea off its east coast. Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said the regime's public acknowledgment of coronavirus cases meant 'the public health situation must be serious'. But he added: 'This does not mean North Korea is suddenly going to be open to humanitarian assistance and take a more conciliatory line toward Washington and Seoul.'", "8359cfc10d9586cbe0d1aa36cda9b6c94c5c7627aa294fbfd370e3db": "Tony Blair has urged Keir Starmer to reject 'woke' politics and present a programme for government that is 'radical without being dangerous'. A report published by the Tony Blair Institute analyses the impact of class on voting in the 2019 general election and beyond. Based on analysis by the veteran pollster Peter Kellner, it points to particular problems for Labour with two groups: the 26% of voters who fit into the formal definition of middle class; and the 12% who would be defined as working class by pollsters but consider themselves middle class. The first group voted 57% to remain in the EU, yet the Conservatives were 22% ahead with these voters in 2019, despite their central message being that they would 'get Brexit done'. These voters, the former Labour leader suggests, are 'worried about issues like tax and economic competence'. The second group, whom Blair calls the 'aspirational working class', voted to leave the EU by a narrower 53% but backed the Conservatives over Labour by a 32% margin. In a punchy foreword, Blair claims of this latter group: 'A large number voted Conservative despite disagreeing with the party on Brexit. They thought Labour's far-left economic policy was a bigger threat than Brexit.' Without what he calls the 'millstone' of Starmer's predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, Blair claims Labour can win many of these voters back - and analysis of recent polling in the report shows a 12% swing to Labour among this 'blue-collar aspirational' group. The former prime minister suggests they are social conservatives, and thus urges Labour to ensure it is on the centre ground on 'culture war' issues such as transgender rights. Blair says the party should 'plant Labour's feet clearly near the centre of gravity of the British people, who want fair treatment for all and an end to prejudice, but distrust and dislike the 'cancel culture', 'woke' mentality.' Labour has sometimes appeared to struggle with culture war issues. For example, Starmer and the party chair, Anneliese Dodds, were criticised recently for being unable to give a straightforward answer to the question: what is a woman? A clearer frontbench line has since been agreed, resulting in the shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, telling an interviewer: 'Men have penises, women have vaginas, here ends my biology lesson.' The Conservative party co-chair Oliver Dowden has sought to capitalise on the party's discomfort, accusing Starmer in a recent speech of 'kowtowing to the cancel culture brigade' and claiming: 'The Corbynistas, they are still there.' Starmer has been accused by some on the left of Labour of winning the leadership under false pretences by espousing key tenets of Corbynism during the campaign in 2020 and then moving towards the centre ground. Blair also calls on Labour to work on rebuilding its economic credibility, as he says the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has already begun to do. 'Labour must cure both its cultural and its economic aspiration problems. It must do the first to regain those voters who went Tory despite being traditional blue collar. These are the northern 'red wallers'. But Labour must also do the second to have any realistic chance of winning,' he says. He also warns Starmer against excessive caution - something the Labour leader is charged with by some colleagues. 'The bane of progressive politics is to think the choice is between being voter-friendly and boring, or exciting and voter-repellent,' he says. As an example of the kind of radical policy he would like to see, Blair suggests tackling concerns about illegal immigration by introducing biometric ID as a precondition for accessing work and public services.", "2f8a873b2f86f8c7f16e47bec70e4fac74b77e90745f03d0a3552c9d": "Cuban rescue workers have recovered the body of the 45th and last person believed missing after an explosion blew the sides off a luxury hotel in historic Havana. The blast on 6 May at the five-star Hotel Saratoga - a block from the city's famous Capitol building, in a renovated area of Havana popular with tourists - left more than 100 people trapped, killed or injured. Fifteen remain hospitalised. Officials say a gas leak caused the explosion. Luis Carlos Guzman, chief of Cuba's firefighting corps, told reporters at the site of the blast that the woman whose body had been recovered, believed to be a waitress at the hotel, was 'as of now, the last missing person'. The hotel was in the process of being renovated after a two-year closure due to the pandemic, and had been due to open this week. Most of those killed or injured were Cuban staff or passersby, including a Spanish tourist and a pregnant woman. Several children from a nearby school were injured and four were killed. Shortly after the recovery of what was believed to be the last body, the Cuban president, Miguel Diaz-Canel, declared a period of national mourning. For days, rescue workers have sifted through piles of debris at the base of the hotel's neo-classical style building, which is more than a century old. Experts have begun to consider the fate of the 19th-century former warehouse that was converted into a hotel early in the last century. Roberto Enriquez, a spokesman for the military-owned Gaviota tourism company that operates the Saratoga, said experts' initial estimates were that 80% of the hotel was damaged by Friday's explosion, which hurled tonnes of concrete chunks into busy streets and seriously harmed neighbouring structures. He said that when rescue efforts finished, authorities would look more deeply into what to do with the ruin. Also badly damaged was Cuba's most important Baptist church, which is next door to the Saratoga. The explosion shook the church and shattered the 19th-century dome. Concrete plunged from walls, and wood and glass showered down from the windows. Parts of the upper floors collapsed at the building, which houses not only Calvary Baptist Church but a seminary and the denomination's headquarters for western Cuba. The famous, elegant building now known as the Teatro Marti was just a few years old when, in 1887, Baptists began holding services across the street on a corner in Old Havana that had once held a circus. Cuba was still a Spanish colony and its Capitol building - modelled on the US Capitol - would not be built nearby for a few decades yet.", "f01c243cd5fe46b9b2c141ba6d1cb2e03057b70ab0a03501afa99f91": "An Indian couple are taking their son to court demanding that he and his wife either produce a grandchild within a year or cough up almost $650,000. Sanjeev and Sadhana Prasad say that they exhausted their savings raising and educating their pilot son and paying for a lavish wedding. Now they want payback. 'My son has been married for six years but they are still not planning a baby,' the couple said in their petition filed with a court in Haridwar last week. 'At least if we have a grandchild to spend time with, our pain will become bearable.' The compensation they are demanding - 50m rupees ($646,000) - includes the cost of a wedding reception in a five-star hotel, a luxury car worth $80,000 and paying for the couple's honeymoon abroad, the Times of India reported on Thursday. The parents also forked out $65,000 to get their son trained as a pilot in the US only for him to return to India unemployed, the paper said. 'We also had to take a loan to build our house and now we are going through a lot of financial hardships,' the couple said in their petition. 'Mentally too we are quite disturbed because we are living alone.' The couple's lawyer, Arvind Kumar, said the petition would be taken up for hearing by the court in northern India on 17 May. India has a strong joint family system with many generations - including grandparents, nephews, aunts and uncles - often living in the same household. However, in recent years the trend has shifted, with young couples preferring to move away from their parents or siblings, and wives - such as in this case - opting to work rather than focus on having children and staying at home.", "e3eb2fc29320f260df085e7839f476d39226d8b82014f69fff95d505": "Shireen Abu Aqleh, the Palestinian American journalist shot dead during an Israeli army operation, has been honoured with a full state memorial in the West Bank city of Ramallah. At least 5,000 people lined the streets on Thursday as her coffin, draped in the Palestinian flag, was driven through the city and the Qalandia checkpoint en route to St Joseph hospital nearer her home in occupied East Jerusalem. Her funeral will be held in the holy city on Friday. Attenders brought wreaths of flowers and waved Palestinian flags as the ambulance carrying her body passed by, escorted by a dozen masked gunmen belonging to the Palestinian Fatah movement. Some people threw rose petals while the militants fired into the air, accompanied by chants of 'From Ramallah to Jenin, God have mercy on you, Shireen' and 'The true voice never dies'. The 51-year-old reporter was shot in the head on Wednesday morning in the West Bank city of Jenin during what her colleagues at the scene said was a surprise burst of Israeli fire on a small group of journalists covering an expected Israeli military raid. Video of the incident shows Abu Aqleh was wearing a helmet and body armour clearly marked 'press'. Ali Samodi, a producer for Al Jazeera who was shot in the back, told the Guardian from his hospital bed that contrary to claims made by Israeli officials, there were no gunmen standing near the journalists when they were targeted. 'There were no fighters around, no civilians, nothing. Just the Israeli soldiers and the press. There were many bullets. After I was hit and Shireen was killed, they just kept shooting,' he said. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) initially said its troops shot back after coming under 'massive fire' from militants in Jenin in the northern West Bank. The town is a historical flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the IDF has been conducting near-daily raids there in the wake of a recent wave of terrorist attacks against Israelis, which have left 19 dead. Many of the perpetrators came from the Jenin area. Israeli officials, including the prime minister, Naftali Bennett, initially insisted there was 'a considerable chance that armed Palestinians, who fired wildly, were the ones who brought about the journalist's unfortunate death.' But later on Wednesday the Israeli military chief Lt Gen Aviv Kochavi and the defence minister, Benny Gantz, appeared to back away from those assertions. Gantz conceded it could have been 'the Palestinians who shot her' or fire from 'our side', adding: 'We are not sure how she was killed. We are investigating.' The IDF circulated what it said was a video of militants in Jenin engaged in a gunfight on the morning Abu Aqleh was shot, in which they claimed to have hit a soldier. The footage was challenged by the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, which visited the two locations and found from the GPS coordinates that it was impossible for the shooting depicted in the IDF-distributed video to be the same gunfire that hit Abu Aqleh and Samodi. Israel has denied allegations from the Qatar-based Al Jazeera that the journalists were 'intentionally targeted' and Abu Aqleh was 'assassinated in cold blood'. The correspondent's death has led to grief and condemnation across the Palestinian territories and the Middle East. Abu Aqleh was a familiar face to millions, reporting on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in often dangerous circumstances for Al Jazeera's Arabic channel since 1997. In an unusual move, considering Abu Aqleh's reporting was often critical of the Palestinian Authority (PA), but in an indication of the respect for her across Palestinian society, a memorial service for the reporter was held at the Ramallah compound of PA president, Mahmoud Abbas, on Thursday morning. Foreign diplomats, journalists, religious leaders and prominent Palestinian and Arab Israeli politicians were in attendance as Abbas vowed 'this crime should not go unpunished,' adding that the PA held Israel 'completely responsible' for her death and had 'refused and rejected' an Israeli proposal for a joint investigation into the killing. 'We refused a joint investigation because [Israelis] are the criminals and we don't trust them,' he said. 'We will go to the international criminal court to uncover the truth.' The ICC launched an investigation into possible Israeli war crimes over a year ago, although Israel has rejected the probe as biased. Hussein al-Sheikh, a senior aide to Abbas, has rejected an Israeli request to conduct ballistic analysis on the bullet, saying the PA would conduct its own investigation and convey the results 'with high transparency' to Abu Aqleh's family, the US, Qatar and the public. Bennett accused the Palestinians on Thursday of denying Israel 'access to the basic findings required to get to the truth'. He called on the PA not to take 'any steps to disrupt the investigation or to contaminate the investigation process'. The EU has called for an independent inquiry while the US has demanded the killing be 'transparently investigated' - calls echoed by the UN human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet. An initial autopsy and forensic examination were conducted in the West Bank city of Nablus hours after Abu Aqleh's death, but no final conclusions have been disclosed. The journalist's funeral will take place on Friday at a Roman Catholic church in Jerusalem before she is buried in the family plot in the city's Mount Zion cemetery. 'Shireen's killing was a message to the Palestinian people to try and kill our spirit,' said Mufaz Jaba, 38, who attended the memorial procession in Ramallah. 'Instead it's the opposite. Her death has helped unite Palestinian society and reminded the world of how important the Palestinian cause is,' he said.", "6f09faf92bb976634212e2b45df0c37fa21c07e6a3439af2a90b55b8": "Emergency flood alerts were issued for parts of south-east Queensland on Friday morning, as the state endures its sixth flooding event since December.  The flood warning siren sounded in Grantham on Friday morning, as residents in low-lying areas were urged to move to higher ground. Meteorologists have predicted severe weather and heavy rainfall to drench south-east Queensland on Friday, including in Brisbane, Toowoomba, Gympie, Bundaberg, Gladstone, Caboolture and Gatton. Totals of 160mm could bring life-threatening flash flooding, with major flooding forecast for Cape River, Laidley Creek, Cooper Creek, Warrill Creek, Bremer River and the Logan and Condamine rivers. Moderate flood warnings have been issued for upper Brisbane River, Eyre Creek, Baffle Creek and Kolan River, as well as Mary River at Gympie. Initial flood watch notices have been issued for the Wide Bay and Burnett, Darling Downs and Granite Belt areas in south-east Queensland. Lockyer Creek residents in low-lying areas were urged to self-evacuate, and those whose homes were flooded in February were told to activate their emergency plan. A public shelter was opened at Lowood state high school. The area was among those devastated in the historic 2011 floods. An alert was also issued for Stanthorpe, on the southern downs, but there was no immediate evacuation order. QFES assistant commissioner Andrew Short said residents should reconsider their need to travel, with hundreds of roads already cut by flood waters. Almost 70 schools have been closed. 'Currently, we've got 18 emergency alerts out in a number of councils,' he told ABC radio on Friday. 'So we're looking for people just to listen and respond and act accordingly.' Queensland Fire and Emergency Services swiftwater teams conducted seven rescues overnight and responded to more than 900 calls for help. The Bureau of Meteorology said the highest rainfall over the past 24 hours was near Wilsons Peak, on the border of NSW and Queensland, which reached totals of 290mm. Lockyer Valley council is advising the community to stay in a safe location until threats subside and to not attempt to walk or drive through any flood waters. 'The unfolding rain event is an extremely dangerous situation, and preservation of life remains our key priority,' the council tweeted on Friday morning. The Warrego Highway has also been cut by flood water at Glenore Grove, with flash flooding occurring in many locations across the state. Gympie, Bundaberg, Hervey Bay, Cooroy, Nambour and Rainbow Beach were all on flood watch on Friday morning as a surface trough moved across the coast. 'Locally intense rainfall which may lead to dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding is possible with thunderstorms during Friday afternoon,' the bureau said in an alert on Thursday. The BOM warned of further heavy rainfall over the next 24 hours before lowering in intensity and easing after the weekend. Heavy rainfall across Queensland is the state's sixth major flood event since December with a combined death toll of 28. A man was found safe and well after disappearing near a campsite south of Gympie. Police and swift water rescue crews had been searching for the 36-year-old after he was reported missing at 10am on Thursday. He was last seen chasing his dog away from the Yabba Creek Road campground near Imbil about 11.30pm on Wednesday. Flood waters cut off access to the site with the RACQ LifeLight helicopter deployed amid heavy rainfall. Police confirmed the man had been located on Thursday afternoon and was safe and well. A woman in her 30s died in floods near Mackay earlier this week as rains up to 10 times the monthly average battered the north and the central interior of the state. A man in his 60s was also treated for hypothermia after spending Wednesday night clinging to a tree after his car became swamped by flood waters near Bundaberg.", "9740a88f8ec090a35782c81f7fadd042c669550dea0d479ea7512587": "Rebekah Vardy has been accused of throwing her former agent and friend 'under a bus' in a last-ditch attempt to save her reputation in the 'Wagatha Christie' libel trial. The footballer's wife was accused - during the third day of a libel trial at the high court on Thursday - of deliberately destroying evidence, habitually leaking stories to the Sun newspaper, and trying to shift the blame on to her adviser Caroline Watt. The court heard that just days before the trial began, Vardy said she had belatedly realised after almost three years that she may have been 'betrayed' by her agent, who was a close friend. Vardy told the court that it could have been Watt who was secretly leaking stories from Coleen Rooney's private Instagram account to the Sun - all without Vardy's knowledge or authorisation. Rooney's lawyer, David Sherborne, said this was a desperate last-ditch move by Vardy to stitch up her friend: 'It's not her who betrayed you, it is you who has betrayed her by throwing her under a bus,' he said. Watt declined to give evidence at the trial, citing health reasons. But Sherborne said the real reason Watt would not enter the witness box was because it would expose the lies that had been told. In response, Vardy insisted that Watt was unable to attend the court because she had been 'driven to suicidal thoughts by these proceedings' and the 'antics' of Rooney. Vardy chose to bring the libel case in a bid to restore her reputation, complaining that Rooney had 'weaponised her fanbase' when, in 2019, she made the original accusation that Vardy had leaked stories to the media. Rooney looked on impassively as the court heard comments Vardy made in a 2019 interview following the original accusation: 'Arguing with Coleen is like arguing with a pigeon. You can tell it that you are right and it is wrong but it's still going to shit in your hair.' The court also heard of extensive issues with the retrieval of potential crucial evidence in the case - including data contained in a mobile phone dropped in the North Sea. Vardy said one back-up of her WhatsApp account was missing many key images and voice notes because 'something odd happened as I was exporting the files' and they were lost. Sherborne alleged Vardy had purposefully chosen not to export potentially damaging evidence contained in the WhatsApp account, then disposed of the laptop used to make a back-up. He also claimed Vardy had manually deleted large numbers of messages to and from her agent. Asked what happened to nine months of missing WhatsApp chats between the two women, Vardy seemed unclear. She said she had 'potentially switched phones' during the period and lost the WhatsApp messages in the process but 'I can neither confirm or deny that'. Sherborne alleged in reality it was a deliberate attempt to destroy evidence: 'You deleted all of the messages between you and Caroline Watt.' The lawyer also mocked the suggestion that Watt had accidentally dropped her phone in the North Sea shortly after a request was made to search it for WhatsApp messages. The court heard that Watt 'was filming a coastline' while on a boat trip off Scotland when the boat hit a wave and she dropped the device into the water. Sherborne said he had wanted to search WhatsApp messages held on the phone but it was now 'lying at the bottom of sea in Davy Jones's locker'. Vardy asked the court: 'Who is Davy Jones?' The judge intervened to explain the reference. Rooney's legal team have admitted they do not have a smoking gun proving Vardy, the wife of Leicester City player Jamie Vardy, leaked stories about Rooney to the Sun. However, Sherborne told the court the circumstantial evidence was overwhelming: 'If it looks like a leak, it sounds like a leak, and you even used the word 'leak', it is more likely than not to be a leak.' During one exchange, Vardy admitted knowing that her agent was discussing private information about Rooney with Sun journalist Andy Halls - but insisted it was material the newspaper already knew and therefore not a fresh leak. Sherborne asked Vardy: 'You didn't object at any stage to the fact that Ms Watt was plainly passing on information from Mrs Rooney's private Instagram account to Andy Halls?' Vardy replied: 'I didn't think she was passing on any new information.' Sherborne pressed on: 'Take the word 'new' out of it. Did you, or did you not, know that Ms Watt was passing on information from Mrs Rooney's private account?' Vardy replied: 'She was talking to Mr Halls about information that was already being discussed.' In one WhatsApp exchange read to the court, the agent said a reporter at the Sun wanted to know whether Rooney had definitely crashed her car, a detail that allegedly came from the private Instagram account. Vardy replied with the words: 'Haha she deffo did.' Towards the end of Thursday's hearing, Vardy - who launched the multimillion pound legal case against Rooney in a bid to clear her public reputation - slumped forward with her head in her hands while being cross-examined. The court took regular breaks as she became tearful. When Vardy began one answer by saying 'if I'm honest', the barrister snapped back: 'I would hope you're honest because you're sitting in a witness box.' At one point Rooney's barrister described a WhatsApp message in a conversation between Vardy and Watt which said 'poor Coleen' followed by 'laughing emojis'. Vardy told the court she disputed this characterisation: 'I don't know whether they're laughing emojis.' The lawyer, in an apparent reference to the  emoji, replied: 'OK, crying with laughter.' The trial continues.", "5b5b2e98a321833a1d2d2a96a3457b4b08b3579d64f111e0f87184f9": "A delegation of influential US congress representatives will fly to London within days amid growing concern in the White House about spiralling tensions over the Northern Ireland protocol, the Guardian can reveal. With the UK government poised to table legislation next week which could revoke parts of the protocol, arrangements are being made for at least half a dozen representatives from the US Congress to fly to Europe for a series of meetings in Brussels, Dublin, London and Belfast. The delegation will be headed by the influential chair of the ways and means committee, Richie Neal, which has significant power over future trade deals. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, has previously said the US intends to appoint its own envoy to Northern Ireland. Neal, whose interest in Northern Ireland stretches over three decades, said earlier this year that a trade deal was 'desirable' but that it would not progress if there was 'any jeopardy' to the Good Friday agreement. The delegation is likely to underline President Biden's commitment to defending the Good Friday agreement and the US's role as a guarantor. He has repeatedly emphasised how integral the protocol is to maintaining peace and stability. 'The best path forward is a pragmatic one that requires courage, co-operation and leadership,' a White House spokesman said of the UK's dispute with the EU. It comes as the former Brexit minister Lord Frost says Biden, who invested much energy in the peace process, should stay out of Britain's affairs. 'It is our country that faced terrorism, faced the Troubles. I am old enough to remember having to check under my car every morning, as a diplomat, before I went to work,' he told an audience in America. Boris Johnson is expected to give a speech as soon as Monday on the future of the protocol after exchanges between the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, and the European Commission vice-president, Maros Sefcovic, which a UK source described as 'tetchy'. In a phone call, Truss said that unless the EU showed the 'requisite flexibility' in talks over the trading arrangements she would have 'no choice but to act'. Johnson, who negotiated the protocol as part of the Brexit agreement, firmly backed Truss on Thursday, saying 'institutions set up under the Good Friday agreement aren't functioning' and political governance in Northern Ireland has collapsed. 'The people of Northern Ireland need leadership, they need a regional, a provincial government ... they haven't got that,' Johnson said, after a discussion of the strategy with cabinet ministers. 'That's a real problem. And the reason they don't have that is because there's one community in Northern Ireland that won't accept the way the protocol works at present - we've got to fix that.' The UK has sent Johnson's close ally Conor Burns as an envoy on the protocol to speak to senior figures in Washington over the course of the week, including meeting a special Northern Ireland committee of congressmen on Friday. Both Truss and Burns have argued that negotiations have reached a crunch point because of the impasse at Stormont, where the Democratic Unionist party has said it will not re-enter the Northern Ireland executive while the issues with the protocol remain. On Thursday, Truss and Sefcovic spoke for the first time since it was revealed the UK was considering tabling draft legislation to unilaterally override part of the trading arrangements. The standoff between the two is testing wider relations with the EU at a time when 'bigger things', such as Finland joining Nato, are happening, Ireland's foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said on Thursday. A UK government source said Truss had argued that the lack of a functioning executive in Northern Ireland was a key security concern that merited the response. 'Liz's primary concern in all this is upholding the Belfast Good Friday agreement,' they said. 'The protocol is the major cause of political instability - disrupting trade and creating a two-tier system where people in Northern Ireland are treated differently to the rest of the UK. So it's clear and obvious that we need to change the parts that aren't working. 'If the EU won't help us do that and show more pragmatism, then we'll have to take action that solves those problems. That would very much be in disappointment rather than anger.' David McAllister, a German centre-right MEP who chairs the European parliament's UK coordination group, said the EU was united against renegotiating the protocol. 'The protocol was signed and ratified by both sides. Nobody here in Brussels is interested in starting these new complicated discussions and political fights,' he said. Truss said she had told Sefcovic the protocol was 'the greatest obstacle' to forming a new Northern Ireland executive after last week's elections. There are no further plans for the pair to speak. Sefcovic told her there was 'no room to expand the negotiating mandate or introduce new proposals to reduce the overall level of trade friction', according to a Foreign Office statement. The government called it a matter of 'regret' that the EU 'would not show the requisite flexibility to help solve those issues ... then, as a responsible government, we would have no choice but to act.' Sefcovic said it remained of 'serious concern that the UK government intends to embark on the path of unilateral action'. He said the EU was still waiting for the UK's response to proposals it made in February. 'We have made clear that there is still potential to be explored in our proposals,' he said. 'Unilateral action, effectively disapplying an international agreement such as the protocol, is simply not acceptable.'", "61988e9f583a88b70018e67130b2e20da6f0e096f8f81fb3dd6de168": "The US justice department secretly issued a subpoena to gain access to details of the phone account of a Guardian reporter as part of an aggressive leak investigation into media stories about an official inquiry into the Trump administration's child separation policy at the southern border. Leak investigators issued the subpoena to obtain the phone number of Stephanie Kirchgaessner, the Guardian's investigations correspondent in Washington. The move was carried out without notifying the newspaper or its reporter, as part of an attempt to ferret out the source of media articles about a review into family separation conducted by the Department of Justice's inspector general, Michael Horowitz. It is highly unusual for US government officials to obtain a journalist's phone details in this way, especially when no national security or classified information is involved. The move was all the more surprising in that it came from the DoJ's inspector general's office - the watchdog responsible for ethical oversight and whistleblower protections. Katharine Viner, the Guardian's editor-in-chief, decried the action as 'an egregious example of infringement on press freedom and public interest journalism by the US Department of Justice'. She added: 'We will be asking the DoJ urgently for an explanation for why and how this could have occurred, and for an apology. We will also be seeking assurances that our reporter's details will be erased from DoJ systems and will not be used for any further infringements of press freedom.' The leak inquiry was conducted on behalf of the DoJ by the inspector general's office of an outside government department, housing and urban development (Hud). Its investigation focused on allegations that an employee within the DoJ's inspector general's office had leaked sensitive information to three news outlets - the Guardian, the New York Times and NBC News. The Guardian was the only one of the three outlets to have a subpoena issued relating to its reporter's phone account. The Guardian published two sensitive reports by Kirchgaessner within the timeframe of the DoJ review into child separation covered by the leak inquiry. On 23 July 2020 she revealed that the DoJ's former deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein had personally advised that migrant parents should be prosecuted, no matter how young the children accompanying them. On 2 September 2020, Kirchgaessner reported that a senior justice department official nominated by Trump to be a federal judge had participated in the removal of a Texas prosecutor who had sounded the alarm over child separation. On Thursday, the investigative reporter Jason Leopold released a redacted version of the Hud leak inquiry report obtained under freedom of information laws. It revealed that leak investigators had reviewed evidence of 127 phone calls totalling about six hours in length with 'phone numbers identified as belonging to reporter Stephanie Kirchgaessner of the Guardian', and an additional 126 phone calls about six hours and 20 minutes 'with a phone number identified as belonging to the Guardian generally'. The leak report also discloses that the DoJ issued an 'administrative subpoena' to a telecommunications company for 'subscriber information to confirm that a specific telephone number belonged to the Guardian'. It said that 'basic subscriber information' had been obtained involving 'names, addresses, and length of service only' and 'not the contents of communications'. Child separation was effected in 2018 under the Trump administration. Known officially as 'zero tolerance', the policy ordered federal prosecutors to act against undocumented immigrants entering the US unlawfully even when minors were present - a reversal of previous practice which had spared families from criminal proceedings in order to avoid children being separated from their parents. The policy led to more than 3,000 children being separated from their parent or guardian, and to widespread chaos in which the location of many children became unknown. The much-delayed DoJ inspector general's report into the practice was finally published after two years, in January 2021. Earlier this week Politico reported that an employee of the DoJ inspector general's office had 'abruptly resigned' after coming under scrutiny from the leak investigation.", "0b15263a8624b324f116371c4690289c0ee105f1825fa2b80eb1ce68": "Eleven people were killed and dozens were rescued after a boat capsized near Puerto Rico on Thursday, authorities said. It wasn't immediately clear how many people were aboard the boat when it turned over, said US coast guard spokesman Ricardo Castrodad. He said a 'mass rescue effort' was still underway. 'We're looking to rescue as many people as we can and find as many survivors as we can,' he said. At least eight Haitians were taken to the hospital, although the nationalities of all those aboard the boat were not immediately known. Authorities said people aboard the boat were believed to be migrants. The incident was the latest in a string of capsizings across the region as people from Haiti and the Dominican Republic flee violence and poverty in their countries. A US Customs and Border Protection helicopter spotted the overturned boat late Thursday morning. 'If not for that, we would not have known about this until someone would have found any sign or received reports from people that their loved ones are missing,' Castrodad said. 'They found them early enough that we were able to coordinate a response.' The boat was spotted more than 11 miles (18 km) north of the uninhabited island of Desecheo, which is off Puerto Rico's west coast. The US coast guard said those rescued were 20 men and 11 women. The capsizing comes less than a week after the US coast guard and Dominican navy on Saturday rescued 68 people in the Mona Passage, a treacherous area between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. One woman believed to be from Haiti died, Castrodad said. 'These voyages are dangerous,' Castrodad said. 'They're unsafe, they are grossly overloaded ... (and) no lifesaving equipment. It wouldn't really take much for any of these vessels to capsize.' From October 2021 to March, 571 Haitians and 252 people from the Dominican Republic were detained in waters around Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, according to US Customs and Border Protection. The majority of those Haitians, 348 of them, landed in Puerto Rico's uninhabited Mona Island and were rescued. In fiscal year 2021, 310 Haitians and 354 Dominicans were detained, compared with the 22 Haitians and 313 Dominicans apprehended in fiscal year 2020. Meanwhile, the US coast guard said that in the fiscal year that ended 30 September, it apprehended 1,527 Haitians, 838 Cubans and 742 people from the Dominican Republic in the region, which includes Florida and the Caribbean. Since then, trips of human smuggling boats have only increased, authorities say. In January, the coast guard searched for at least 38 people missing off Florida's coast after a suspected human smuggling boat that had left the Bahamas capsized in a storm. A sole survivor was reported. Hundreds of Haitians have arrived in Florida alone in recent months after swimming ashore. Haiti is struggling with a surge in gang-related violence that has killed dozens of people, including women and children, and caused thousands of families to flee their homes. Kidnappings also have spiked, including those of eight Turkish citizens who on Sunday were forced off a bus they had boarded in the Dominican Republic. Kidnappings in the country of more than 11 million people have increased 180% and homicides are up 17% in the past year, according to the United Nations, which last week expressed concern over 'the rapid deterioration of security and human rights' in Haiti. Many have criticized the administration of US President Joe Biden for deporting more than 20,000 Haitians in recent months given the country's deepening turmoil.

Millions of babies in the US rely on formula, which is the only source of nutrition recommended for infants who are not exclusively breastfed. Here's a look at what's behind the problem and what parents can do: Ongoing supply disruptions and recent safety recalls have combined to leave many pharmacy and supermarket shelves bare. The problems began last year as the Covid-19 pandemic led to disruptions in labor, transportation and raw materials - economy-wide issues that did not spare the formula industry. Inventory was further squeezed by parents stockpiling during lockdowns. Then in February, Abbott Nutrition recalled several major brands of powdered formula and shut down its Sturgis, Michigan, factory when federal officials began investigating four babies who suffered bacterial infections after consuming formula from the facility. Abbott is one of only a handful of companies that produce the vast majority of the US formula supply, so their recall wiped out a large segment of the market. Most formulas contain protein from cow's milk that's been altered to be easier to digest and enhanced with extra nutrients needed for growth and development. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sets specific nutritional requirements, including minimum amounts of protein, fat, calcium and a number of vitamins. Formula makers achieve those levels by adding various sugars, oils and minerals. The formulas are designed to mimic breast milk, though studies have repeatedly shown better health outcomes for babies who are breastfed. Health professionals recommend exclusively breastfeeding babies until they are six-months-old. But federal figures show that only one in four are relying solely on breast milk at that age. Mothers face a number of challenges to long-term breastfeeding, including returning to work and finding the time and equipment needed to pump breast milk. About 60% of mothers stop breastfeeding sooner than they had planned, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). State and federal laws have been enacted to encourage breastfeeding by requiring break time and accommodations for mothers of infants. Rates of breastfeeding have consistently been lower among Black babies than other groups. About three quarters of Black babies are breast fed only in infancy, below the national average of 84%, according to the CDC. Talk with your pediatrician or call a local food bank to see if they can help locate some options. Experts also recommend checking with smaller stores and pharmacies, which may still have supplies when larger stores run out. Most regular baby formulas contain the same basic ingredients and nutrients, so parents should not hesitate to buy a different brand if they are having trouble finding their regular one. Some infants require specialty formulas due to allergies, digestive problems and other medical conditions. Parents should talk to their doctor if they cannot find those products, which manufacturers usually distribute through pharmacies and clinics. Families that qualify for WIC - a federal program similar to food stamps that pays for about half the formula used in the US - can also contact their local agency. Health officials also warn against buying formula via social media websites or outside of conventional retailers because they could be counterfeit. Many do-it-yourself formula recipes are made from cow's milk and granular sugar that may be difficult for young babies to digest. They also lack the specific vitamins and proteins found in breastmilk and FDA-approved formulas that are needed for basic nutrition. 'Particularly for small babies, many of these formulas and mixtures that are found online don't contain even the most basic nutrient mixes that babies need to survive,' said Dr Steven Abrams, a pediatrician at the University of Texas, Austin. Abrams also stressed that parents should never dilute infant formula. Several national chains have limited the number of containers customers can purchase in stores and online. For CVS and Walgreens, the limit is three per customer. Target limits purchases to four per person when buying online. Amazon said Thursday it is working to keep the products available on its website and monitoring third-party sellers for price-gouging. 'If we identify a price that violates our policy, we remove the offer and take appropriate action with the seller,' a company spokesperson said in a statement. Health regulators recently announced several steps designed to boost supply, including allowing faster importation of formula made overseas. Typically, 98% of baby formula consumed in the US is made domestically, according to federal officials. The FDA is working with Abbott to fix the violations that triggered the shutdown of its Michigan plant, which produces Similac, EleCare and several other leading powdered formulas. The company says its products have not been directly linked to the bacterial infections in children, pointing out that genetic samples collected from its factory did not match those found in several infants who got sick. The Chicago-based company said this week that, pending FDA approval, it could restart manufacturing at its plant within two weeks. After that it would take another six to eight weeks before new products hit store shelves. But even then, experts caution that many of the industrywide issues will continue to restrain supplies. 'This is going to be a problem and it's not going away for at least a period of several months,' Abrams said.", "25b108fef4e4c11220363365c8dc77ab8e1f9fe8ff5a0367e8c3a94b": "", "8d6340f75b2950a660238b7bf6f021b78b6d76b105a089a66f59609e": "Every day, for the past 20 years, Joyce Naserian has laid out her handmade curios near an entrance to the Masai Mara park to sell to passing tourists. Her earnings have helped the 46-year-old feed and educate all four of her children.  In northern Kenya, about 1,200 semi-nomadic women earned more than 9m Kenyan shillings (PS62,000) selling beadwork to visitors at 43 community wildlife conservancies in 2020. Just as it was Naserian in the Mara, selling the beadwork was a solid money earner for these women. But that was before Covid. The collapse of eco-tourism during the pandemic has spelled disaster for conservation initiatives and livelihoods in Kenya and beyond. Cuts to budgets and staff, reduced salaries and stalled development and education projects have plunged communities into poverty, leading to a rise in poaching and the illegal wildlife trade. Reuters reported that in the first three months of 2020, the African continent lost $55bn (PS44bn) in travel and tourism revenues - funds that go towards running conservation programmes that benefit local communities. Kenya's government has relaxed a raft of travel restrictions, but the return of international tourists has been slow, while concerns about carbon emissions from long-haul air travel may be putting people off flying into conservation areas. 'It is a real struggle for survival,' says Daniel Sopia, head of Masai Mara Wildlife Conservancies Association. 'Women who relied solely on beadwork were badly affected as there was not a single tourist coming to the Mara at the height of Covid-19 restrictions. Household income dropped significantly and they had to rely on food from well-wishers.' The 15 wildlife conservancies that Sopia heads comprise individual blocks of land owned by Maasai people. The landowners lease the land, covering 14,0426 hectares (347,000 acres), to safari camps and lodges, which pay fees that fund projects providing water, healthcare and education, as well as setting up small businesses. In return, the 14,500 landowners protect biodiversity within the Mara ecosystem while preserving their traditional lifestyle. Four years before the pandemic, the conservancies contributed almost 120m Kenyan shillings to social programmes in the region. Two years ago, payments to landowners fell by 50%, forcing conservancies to scale back operations and focus on priorities such as allowances to wildlife rangers. Sopia and his team had to scramble to prevent the total collapse of conservation programmes. 'Conservancies remained operational throughout the pandemic despite the lack in tourism income,' says Sopia. 'We were fortunate to mobilise some resources from development partners and private foundations. These helped to cover rangers' salaries, food rations, fuel, and vehicle maintenance. 'We hope the arrangement will be in place till June 2022 as we slowly wean the conservancies off such aid,' he says. Some foreign organisations are now making a comeback after a two-year hiatus. In March 2022, UK charity Tusk brought together conservation professionals from across Africa for a symposium in Masai Mara to help organisations diversify fundraising and build resilient units. Since 1990, Tusk has raised more than PS80m towards conservation projects across more than 20 African countries and helped to protect more than 40 threatened species. Tusk's upcoming Wildlife Ranger Challenge seeks to raise money for rangers whose pay was slashed in the pandemic. 'The last two years have been extremely tough for everyone. The conservation sector in particular has had to endure huge losses, dramatic cutbacks in operating budgets, and, sadly, redundancies,' says Charlie Mayhew, Tusk Trust chief executive. Wanjiku Kinuthia, strategyhead at Maliasili, hopes the renewed interest in broadening discussions about African conservation will boost small organisations that are often left out of big decisions, despite being closest to the vulnerable communities bearing the brunt of a collapsing environment. 'They often miss out on global dialogues,' says Kinuthia, whose group supports about 20 other organisations in seven countries, including smaller ones that lack the networks to make their voices heard. 'They do not understand how the media works or how to tell their stories. We can be catalysts of change for such grassroots organisations.' Involving communities in conservation would safeguard the 65% of wildlife that lives outside protected areas, she says. 'All people need are tools to help them coexist with animals in the 21st century while benefiting from conservation.' However, some conservationists say the only way to sustain conservation programmes and avoid disruption is by governments increasing budgets to the sector, a challenge considering the current low levels of state investment. Dickson Kaelo, who heads the Kenya Wildlife Conservancies Association, says African countries depend on foreign donors to fund development and conservation is no exception. 'There is no single answer to cutting off foreign aid,' says Kaelo. 'There are no government incentives for setting up a conservancy to protect an elephant that walks all over destroying life and property. 'If you are in the farming sector, you can get a loan to buy a tractor, but there is no institution that gives loans for those who want to invest in protecting wildlife, and while a person buying a vehicle to ferry tourists gets some tax rebates, we get no such benefits when buying a truck for wildlife rangers.' He adds: 'The government is creating laws that hamper conservation, including the Natural Resources (Benefits Sharing) Bill, with a formula that will see those in conservation give 80% of their proceeds to government and a paltry 12.8% to local communities. In addition, the government requires that you come up with a management plan, a strategic and environmental study, multiple registration procedures and other permits before setting up a private conservancy. If you want to lease land you have to pay 2% stamp duty for the entire period, say for 20 years, and pay that upfront. Why don't we see such laws when someone wants to cut down a tree?' Kaddu Sebunya, chief executive at the African Wildlife Foundation says Africans must be exposed to the benefits of wildlife and wild lands so they can lead on conservation. A starting point would be to make tourism more accessible, he says, 'as it is easier for someone in New York or Sydney to book a tour to Africa than someone living in Harare or Lagos.'. 'Building our domestic and regional tourism market will be a stepping stone to increasing the African voice for conservation. While millions of Africans traverse the continent to travel for business, how can these numbers be translated to nature tourists? 'Data from Unctad [UN Conference on Trade and Development] indicates that four out of 10 international tourists in Africa come from the continent, and this begs the question, 'is our product marketing catering to the four Africans?' It is high time for a shift in mindset,' says Sebunya.

In the tangle of streets near exit 3 of Seoul's Dongmyo station, hundreds of vendors sell everything from old Instamatic cameras to books, bags and vinyl records. Located in the South Korean capital's historic district of Dongdaemun, Dongmyo's bustling flea market is scattered around a shrine built in honour of an ancient Chinese military commander. But there is more to the neighbourhood than bargains, vintage clothes, and retro treasures. It also serves as a cultural hub for the city's senior citizens to shop, socialise and show off their unique style. 'One day, I noticed a senior gentleman looking for clothes just like me. His style blew me away,' recalls Seoul-based photographer Kim Dong-hyun, 29, who spends his days documenting the city's vibrant senior street fashion scene, much of which he shares on Instagram. Over the years, Dongmyo has undergone a lot of change, becoming a destination for young people's newfound appreciation of vintage clothing on a budget. At its core though, Dongmyo has always been a playground for the city's elderly population. 'I've met some people who have been going there every week for 30 years,' Kim says, based on the many conversations he has had with the people he has photographed. South Korea is a rapidly ageing society. By 2050, the number of elderly people could account for nearly 44% of the country's population. While many senior citizens feel healthier than ever and do not regard themselves as old, elderly loneliness is a significant problem. 'In Korea, there aren't many places where elderly people can go and have fun. But in Dongmyo, they can go shopping, they can play, meet friends and drink makgeolli  [rice wine]. It's their area, and they don't need to care about what other people think.' 'From their hairdos to their glasses and shoes, they know how to look good and take care of themselves. They pursue their own styles and unique ways to express their individuality. Many of us believe that trendy people are just young people, a message further amplified by the media. But fashion has no age,' he says. Among the senior citizens that hang out in Dongdaemun is Lee Seok-ki, one member of a group known as the 'military crew'. The group is comprised of three men whose styles are different from each other: Lee prefers a minimalist traditional military look, while his friends like to reinterpret military style in a modern way, decorating clothes with colourful embroidered patches and badges.  If anything, senior fashion is more refined, Kim says. 'It's like wine. In your 20s, you just taste everything, but by your 70s, your taste is sharper - you know what you like.' As a child, Chae Myung-hee, 74, developed a passion for fashion that led her to work as a women's clothes designer for 40 years. Even during the pandemic when some people dressed down and avoided makeup, she says she made an effort to always look great, whether she was wearing a mask or not. 'It's always been a part of me,' Chae says. In his upcoming book, Mut - Street Fashion of Seoul, Kim provides a glimpse into the world of senior fashion. He hopes the book will provide a new perspective on a demographic that is often overlooked or under-appreciated. Kim says older people should be recognised for their cool and flair, which is known as meot in Korean, or as Kim likes to stylise it online and in his book - mut. 'It's more than the English word 'cool',' he says. 'Sometimes it can mean something is wonderful, sometimes it can mean nice, sometimes it's gorgeous or fabulous. I can't express it differently or translate the word, and don't see the need for it.' The images offer hope, he says, and a new way of looking at ageing. 'I think some people have hope when they see my pictures. They can see that they too can continue to be fashionable when they grow older. 'When a headline uses the word 'grandfather', we automatically assume something negative ... I want to show that seniors have individual personalities, that they too can have their own meot.'", "3d8833efc18e2adae176ac9292d715d79e046b79bed448aa0abcce21": "", "ba8ca44bbce346be3b2a8a6b69726000592fbd23f34ffa12b6b1a56b": "", "b2645083494ebd4036d99d383ba5c4aee38303883de26a56af8c5c56": "", "313b89697ecf4ebe29dacc3fc14668336b1b6275bf7986436b272463": "", "0baba6ebd480897cd838cda23476c68006d3c07952c74c8347a39a19": "", "bed66d8b1f0214ad6eca18eff1e9f00b72a38565849ef8faa67b6d7c": "", "903fc136afc7b612d0d8ca48d2c88803cc87aef74cae0ed558ce4139": "", "5e61c2def6a40d4f21e65ef67481fcceebd74ccfcb59f504dba26e06": "", "d32e621f9d42c6b64c8c2906fa6672a16b9619e1f7076aed0a1a7eea": "", "1eb1312f08550ad5d6320962e6ee1586506d6df285f0fb8500f595d7": "", "a661072e0351f8830dc96cf894e50a94d1133e359e3d46c2bcb11cdb": "", "790be0cafe23f3b76dbe8e6bcc7992c3328906c08b4678209ba0a1e4": "", "2cb4b98bcd0997c89b1f186cb7b779fe9ebc6f3dd58fa5f6f28e03d2": "", "9631197de113b56f548456ddc230a92aa4ab89b5a62b12ca424c3362": "", "0133f4227c7473cc3eaf9fef3cc4b41fb40cc31aebc91d59b7d9f9e2": "The departure of Sri Lanka's prime minister, Mahinda Rajapaksa, follows weeks of protest and a deepening crisis. There is no bankruptcy system for states but if there was then the south Asian country - down to its last $50m (PS40m) of reserves - would be first in line to use it. A team from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) this week started work with officials in Colombo over a bailout that will include a tough package of reforms as well as financial support. But as the IMF and its sister organisation, the World Bank, know full well, this is about more than the mismanagement of an individual country. They fear Sri Lanka is the canary in the coalmine. Across the world, low- and middle-income countries are struggling with a three-pronged crisis: the pandemic, the rising cost of their debt, and the increase in food and fuel prices caused by Russia's invasion of neighbouring Ukraine. David Malpass, the World Bank's president, explained his concerns at the organisation's spring meeting last month. 'I'm deeply concerned about developing countries,' Malpass said. 'They are facing sudden price increases for energy, fertiliser and food, and the likelihood of interest rate increases. Each one hits them hard.' The UN has sought to quantify the problem. Its trade and development arm, UNCTAD, said in a recent report that there were 107 countries facing at least one of three shocks: rising food prices, rising energy prices or tighter financial conditions. All three shocks were being faced by 69 countries - 25 in Africa, 25 in Asia and the Pacific, and 19 in Latin America and the Pacific. The list of countries that look vulnerable is long and varied. The IMF has opened rescue talks with Egypt and Tunisia - both big wheat importers from Russia and Ukraine - and with Pakistan, which has imposed power cuts because of the high cost of imported energy. Sub-Saharan African countries being carefully watched include Ghana, Kenya, South Africa and Ethiopia. Argentina recently signed a $45bn debt deal with the IMF, but other Latin American countries at risk include El Salvador and Peru. For months there has been speculation that Turkey would be the first domino to fall, but despite an annual inflation rate of 70% and an unconventional approach to economic management, it is still standing. Unlike some other countries under threat, Turkey is able to feed its own people. Richard Kozul-Wright, director of the globalisation and development strategies division at UNCTAD, said: 'Countries have domestic problems but most of the shocks have nothing to do with those. The pandemic and the war had nothing to do with these countries, but have led to a huge increase in borrowing.' The World Bank said almost 60% of the lowest-income countries were in debt distress or at high risk of it before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, while the cost of servicing borrowing is rising steeply, particularly for those countries that have amassed debts in foreign currencies. The war in Ukraine has led to investors seeking out the haven of the US dollar, pushing down the value of emerging market currencies. Higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve, America's central bank, have compounded the problem. Emerging market crises are nothing new, but Kozul-Wright said the international community was ill-prepared to deal with a looming debt problem. 'The system can only deal with these problems country by country,' he said. 'But these are systemic issues and currently there is no way of dealing with them systemically.' That may prove costly. Sri Lanka is the first country to buckle under the mounting economic pressures triggered by the war in Ukraine. It is unlikely to be the last.", "15a9016e3a74536db6f52abbb71752cc0bcb1b9391eda4c20ff71a99": "Two presidents and two speeches for Victory Day: from Vladimir Putin in Moscow and Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv. Both presidents talked more about the present day than the past. Both insisted their enemies today were the heirs of the Nazis, and both promised their countries would succeed in what they both said was a defensive war they had been forced to fight. There, however, the similarities between the two addresses by Putin and Zelenskiy came to an end. The first difference was stylistic: Putin was surrounded by the pomp and militarism of the annual Red Square parade, riffing on a topic he has been angry about for years. Zelenskiy, strolling along Kyiv's main street and delivering a casual but impassioned speech straight into the camera, cut a very different figure, as he has since the start of the war. But the main difference was that for most people existing beyond the reach of Russian state television, Zelenskiy's arguments were likely to be a lot more convincing than Putin's. Putin has long used his 9 May speeches to draw parallels between the second world war and the present day, and this year's speech was nothing new, simply a compilation of previous grievances that were recycled and intensified for this year, when his army is fighting a new war. But the images from that war, seen across the world, have made Putin's politicisation of the Soviet wartime sacrifice even less convincing. Putin used the Victory Day podium to reel off a list of grievances against the west that seemed to describe his own regime more aptly. He made reference to 'cancel culture', complaining that so-called 'traditional values' had been cancelled, despite the fact his regime has arrested people for Facebook posts and shut down numerous newspapers for calling the war in Ukraine a war, and not a 'special military operation', the officially approved euphemism. The west was 'rewriting history', Putin complained, ignoring the fact that his regime has done more than any in Europe to quash free historical inquiry about the war years. In modern Russia, the Soviet war effort is seen as sacred, immaculate and not to be sullied by historical inquiry or archival research that might shed light on some of its darker moments. The Russian army was fighting in Ukraine 'so that there is no place in the world for butchers, murderers and Nazis', said Putin, a particularly grim claim given the well-documented evidence of executions, rape, looting and desecration carried out by his troops. For some years, Putin has hinted at comparisons between the modern-day US and the Nazis, bemoaning American hegemony and the 'unipolar world' that followed the Soviet collapse. Back in 2015, Putin used his Victory Day speech to say that 'in the 1930s, enlightened Europe failed immediately to see the deathly threat of Nazi ideology ... Seventy years later, history calls on us to be aware and alert once again. We have seen an effort to create a unipolar world, and we are seeing force-oriented thinking gain traction.' This year Putin made the comparison more explicitly. 'The United States, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, began to talk about its exclusivity, humiliating the whole world,' he said. Over the years, Putin's disquiet about American hegemony has resonated with many different political currents globally and is at the core of why some have admired the Russian president. This year, however, the invasion of Ukraine and occupation of parts of it has made Putin's message harder to stomach, even for many of his fans. One of the telegrams Putin sent on the occasion of Victory Day was a message to the people of Ukraine, wishing them 'good health, success and a long life'. Soon after the speech, air raid sirens sounded again in Kyiv.", "1ec255e7e5b4d62abb33fedb72dd1eadd4a9a86662cf36e208829fad": "The ancient Greek city of Paestum, on Italy's south-west coast, is hardly discreet - its temples are glaringly obvious for all to see. Yet it was only 'rediscovered' in the mid-18th century thanks to the grand tour, when the sons of aristocrats from across Europe, though mostly Britain, visited southern European cultural sites as part of their education. Now its majestic temples have a new guardian - a 38-year-old from Milan. Tiziana D'Angelo is one of the youngest people to direct a big Italian cultural site and is among the few female directors.  'You would expect a very serious and composed reaction but the first thing I did was scream,' she said on being told she had got the job. 'Then came tears of joy.' The first time she set eyes on Paestum, famous for its three Doric temples, dating from about 600 to 450BC, was as a child when visiting the site with her family. Her studies brought her back in 2012 to conduct research on the funerary paintings that adorned hundreds of tombs, dating from the Greek to the Lucanian and Roman eras. These were excavated in Paestum and necropolises in the surrounding area, and she studied them as part of her doctorate at Harvard University. 'I returned periodically and collaborated with Gabriel Zuchtriegel [the former director] on exhibitions, and so I maintained a relationship with the site,' said D'Angelo, who has also studied at Oxford and Cambridge, and until a few weeks ago was an assistant professor at Nottingham University. 'But never would I have imagined that one day I would come back here as director. It's a dream.' Paestum, located in the Cilento area of Italy's Campania region, is often overshadowed by the more popular Pompeii and Herculaneum. Even more low-profile is nearby Velia, where the Greek philosopher Parmenides was born, which along with Paestum formed part of Magna Graecia, the name of the southern Italian coastal areas colonised by the Greeks. The management of the two sites was merged in early 2020. Founded in about 600BC, Paestum was originally called Poseidonia, from Poseidon, or Neptune, the god of the sea, to whom the city was dedicated. It was later conquered by the Lucanians and then the Romans, although D'Angelo said the transitions were gradual. 'You have to think that these people coexisted. They negotiated space and power, and there is archaeological evidence of this: for example, the funerary paintings allow you to reconstruct this much more complex context,' she added. Paestum's walls and amphitheatre remain mostly intact, but it was only in the second half of the 20th century, when excavations began in earnest, that hundreds of painted graves were found in and around the area, including the Tomb of the Diver - the only one dating back to the Greek period. Discovered in a small cemetery in the late 1960s by the noted archaeologist Mario Napoli, its huge grave ledger depicts a naked man diving into the sea, said to be a metaphor of the transition from life to death. Other slabs from the tomb depict scenes of a banquet and homosexual love. The tomb is among those housed at Paestum's museum, and about 400 are currently held in a warehouse that D'Angelo plans to periodically open to the public. The majority date to the Lucanian period. 'You might think these paintings were just a commemoration of the dead, but they were part of the funerary process, as they were actually painted during the ceremony,' she said. Other treasures found at Paestum include various pottery, weapons and ancient Greek homes. Over in Velia, founded by Phocaean Greek colonists who made their way to southern Italy after their victory in a sixth-century naval battle over the Etruscans and their Carthaginian allies off the coast of Corsica, the most recent discovery was two warrior helmets believed to have originated from the battle, one taken from the enemy. Also found were vases and the remains of a temple dedicated to the goddess Athena. 'They built temples that contained Greek weapons but we also found evidence of Etruscan weapons, which tells us they also dedicated the weapons of their enemies to Athena,' said D'Angelo. She plans to consolidate the two parks, including establishing a bus link between them. In Velia, work is under way to make a former railway tunnel, currently serving as a warehouse for the site's treasures, accessible to the public. A museum is planned at Velia, while more space will open at Paestum's museum this year. The Easter weekend was D'Angelo's first as director, and there was a record number of visitors, a sign that she could be in for a busy time. 'I am grateful to all who made this opportunity possible, not only the director general who chose me, but my parents and the teachers at high school who made me passionate about the ancient world and art, and my supervisors and colleagues at the various museums I worked at,' she said.", "97a4cbca800d40961599aeb3245bbf09b1620034bdc420739f854ef6": "As a volunteer working alongside the Red army as they fought their bloody battles against Nazi Germany in Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine, Livdmyla Lishtvanonva, 99, would pick up unexploded shells and ammunition with her bare hands to help clear the streets for the fighting men and women. 'Even off the roofs of buildings,' she recalls with a smile. 'We were fighting for our land.' Kharkiv, eight decades ago, as it is today, was the location for fierce battles in which many lives were lost and Lishtvanonva says that she and her mother, a nurse, had to leave their home city for a village on its outskirts after their apartment was destroyed in a bombing raid. Lishtvanonva laments that the last two months, particularly the sounds and sights of shelling, have brought such memories flooding back. This weekend, as Ukraine quietly marked a day of remembrance and reconciliation and Russia prepared for a more raucous Victory Day to commemorate the defeat of Nazi Germany, those reflections are all the more poignant. But there are new memories now. From the window of her sparsely decorated room in the Kyiv nursing home in Chaiky village, on the western outskirts of Ukraine's capital, near the now infamous and devastated towns of Irpin and Bucha, Lishtvanonva watched just a few weeks ago as a neighbouring business centre went up in flames after being hit by a missile. Like the other 160 residents at the home, she spent days in its dusty and dark basement at the height of the battle and later had to be evacuated to the city centre when Russian soldiers on 8 March climbed over a perimeter fence to launch their drones from its leafy grounds. 'We had a problem with rubbish as it wasn't being collected so I was digging a big hole in the ground to put it all in when suddenly I saw Russians climbing over the fence', recalls Evhen Kryvtsov, 38, the director of the institution. 'I was in a big hole with a shovel. I thought my time might be up.' Thanks to the Ukrainian defence of Kyiv, the Russian stay at the home turned out to be brief, and Ukraine's victory in battle allowed everyone to return three weeks ago. Tetiana Rudyk, 42, the home's deputy director, laughs as she admits that the staff had checked behind every curtain and in every room for hiding Russian soldiers. But there is deep grief felt by the three women living here who are old enough to have memories of the war with Germany. Lishtvanonva, who lives in room 407, says she has always thought of herself as Russian and 'won't pick a side'. 'It is like any other war - it is two political parties fighting because someone wants to be noticed,' she says. But Lishtvanonva adds: 'We were fighting for peace [in the second world war]. I just want peace. Building is a lot more difficult than destroying.' Maria Lebid, 94, in room 406, who picked up a gun for the Red army is too ill to talk at any length, but cries when the war is raised, as does Valentyna Lits, 94, in room 444, who says she cannot understand how such brutal conflict has again come to the country - and via Russia of all places. Lits' father, Pavel, was in the artillery corps in the Red army during the fighting around Kyiv in the 1940s and she remembers a letter he wrote in which he spoke of being ordered to shell an area in which Russians soldiers were in close combat with the Germans. 'He said that he didn't know if his own people had survived,' Lits says. She has two grandsons in Russia in their 40s. They don't talk about the conflict with her when they call, she says, although one of them appears to believe in Putin's 'special military operation'. Yet, Lits' who has interrupted her reading of some old newspaper cuttings about healthy living in order to reminisce and share her thoughts, appears almost embarrassed to admit that what she reads and hears about in the news has filled her with an emotion that had been alien and unthinkable to her until now. 'Throughout my life, I was fine with Russians,' she says, pausing to control her emotions. 'I took some anxiety pills before you came but it isn't working,' she adds, before continuing: 'My husband was from the far east of Russia and his mother didn't want him to marry a Ukrainian but I was fine with Russians. Now, I see and hear what is happening, the murder and rape, the death of children, and I feel hate, I am filled with hate. And I never thought I would hate Russians, never.'", "9ab7f8e0e284ca7ed907ae85b78cbce1201c60464e1f96c1ace610f9": "The world's leading energy economist has warned against investing in large new oil and gas developments, which would have little impact on the current energy crisis and soaring fuel prices but spell devastation to the planet. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), was responding to an investigation in the Guardian that revealed fossil fuel companies were planning huge 'carbon bomb' projects that would drive climate catastrophe. He said countries must seek to replace Russian oil and gas in the near term without damaging their long-term prospects. 'I understand some countries may look at new fossil fuels but they should remember it takes many years to start production,' he said. '[Such projects] are not the solution to our urgent energy security needs and they will lock in fossil fuel use.' Revelations by the Guardian show nearly 200 carbon bomb projects are in planning, or have already started pumping, that will each result in at least 1bn tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions over their lifetimes, equivalent to about 18 years of current global emissions. Companies pursuing such developments could end up with uneconomic stranded assets, Birol warned. 'If the world is to succeed in moving to net zero, these projects may fail to recover their upfront development costs,' he said in an interview with the Guaridan. Soaring global energy prices have led governments to seek new sources of fossil fuels. 'I do understand why countries are reacting like this,' he said. 'But there is the issue of the time horizon.' Big new exploratory projects for oil, gas and coal would take years to produce any fuel and could lock in high greenhouse gas emissions for decades, Birol warned. 'The most suitable projects are those with short lead times and quick payback periods, such as expanding production from existing fields,' he said. Using existing sources more efficiently would also help reduce emissions, Birol noted. He said governments must also urgently seek to reduce fossil fuel demand, through home insulation, cutting speed limits, making public transport cheap or free and introducing car-free days in cities. 'If we do not have these voluntary measures, I'm afraid that energy rationing may be on the table,' he said. Birol said unlike in previous oil shocks, such as those of the 1970s, the world now had cheap alternatives available in the form of solar and wind power, which had plummeted in price. This should prompt governments and companies to push harder for renewable energy. 'I believe we have the chance to make this a historic turning point to a cleaner and more secure energy system,' he said. 'This is the first time I have seen such momentum behind the change to clean energy. 'The world does not need to choose between solving the energy crisis and climate crisis, we can do both.' The UN secretary general also called for an end to new fossil fuel projects, warning that climate change posed 'an existential threat to us all - to the whole world'. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, Antonio Guterres said: 'Main emitters must drastically cut emissions, starting now. This means accelerating the end of our fossil fuel addiction and speeding up the deployment of clean renewable energy.' The IEA advised almost exactly a year ago that no new gas, oil or coal development could take place from this year onwards if the world was to limit global heating to 1.5C. That finding caused shockwaves among governments in the run-up to the UN Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in November, where leaders agreed to bring forward national plans in line with the 1.5C limit. But many countries, and private sector companies, have ignored the advice, as the Guardian's investigation of fossil fuel projects under development has shown. These carbon bombs would in effect eliminate any hope of staying within the 1.5C threshold. Greg Muttitt, an energy expert at the International Institute for Sustainable Development, said: 'Governments and companies often suffer from a form of cognitive dissonance: while recognising the urgency and severity of the climate threat, they still keep developing new oil, gas and coalfields and mines that will worsen the problem. The policy answer is a simple one: when in a hole, you need to stop digging.' Greenpeace said the Guardian's investigation revealed the 'fossil fuel industry's business model remains a blueprint for climate catastrophe'. 'Investment plans by oil and gas firms will blow us past every assessment of what is safe for the climate, and that's shocking,' said the group's senior climate adviser Charlie Kronick. 'But what's truly shocking is that they are not hiding it. These activities are legal and in fact are encouraged by governments around the world, particularly the ones that have the biggest reserves and the most to lose.' Caroline Lucas, an MP for the UK's Green party, said in response to the Guardian's investigation: 'Governments seem intent on sending us towards our own destruction. How many more times must we tell fossil fuel companies to #keepitintheground?' Ed Miliband, the shadow climate change and net zero secretary, said: 'The answer to a global fossil fuel crisis cannot be to double down on fossil fuels. Every country must go further to rapidly accelerate the transition to clean energy. 'That's the right response to the climate crisis, but it's also the right response to the cost of living and energy security crises too - with renewables now by far the cheapest and most secure form of energy. 'Governments around the world should be urgently investing in a green energy sprint to shift decisively off destructive, expensive, and volatile fossil fuels for good.'", "7efcfb5d7501177d1046c28445f337a02a4b505c3546bf238ea1c3c0": "The world's biggest fossil fuel firms are quietly planning scores of 'carbon bomb' oil and gas projects that would drive the climate past internationally agreed temperature limits with catastrophic global impacts, a Guardian investigation shows. The exclusive data shows these firms are in effect placing multibillion-dollar bets against humanity halting global heating. Their huge investments in new fossil fuel production could pay off only if countries fail to rapidly slash carbon emissions, which scientists say is vital.  The oil and gas industry is extremely volatile but extraordinarily profitable, particularly when prices are high, as they are at present. ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and Chevron have made almost $2tn in profits in the past three decades, while recent price rises led BP's boss to describe the company as a 'cash machine'. The lure of colossal payouts in the years to come appears to be irresistible to the oil companies, despite the world's climate scientists stating in February that further delay in cutting fossil fuel use would mean missing our last chance 'to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all'. As the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, warned world leaders in April: 'Our addiction to fossil fuels is killing us.' Details of the projects being planned are not easily accessible but an investigation published in the Guardian shows: At the UN's Cop26 climate summit in November, after a quarter-century of annual negotiations that as yet have failed to deliver a fall in global emissions, countries around the world finally included the word 'coal' in their concluding decision. Even this belated mention of the dirtiest fossil fuel was fraught, leaving a 'deeply sorry' Cop president, Alok Sharma, fighting back tears on the podium after India announced a last-minute softening of the need to 'phase out coal' to 'phase down coal'. Nonetheless, the world agreed coal power was history - the question now was how quickly cheaper renewables could replace it, and how fair the transition would be for the small number of developing countries that still relied on it. But there was no mention of oil and gas in the Cop26 final deal, despite these being responsible for almost 60% of fossil fuel emissions. Furthermore, many of the rich countries, such as the US, that dominate international climate diplomacy and positioned themselves as climate leaders at the conference, are big players in new oil and gas projects. But unlike India, they avoided criticism. That lack of scrutiny prompted the Guardian to spend the months since Cop26 piecing together the clearest picture possible of forthcoming oil and gas exploration and production.  The world's scientists agree the planet is in deep trouble. In August, Guterres reacted strongly to a stark report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world's leading authority on climate science. '[This report] is a code red for humanity,' he said.  The IPCC states carbon emissions must fall by half by 2030 to preserve the chance of a liveable future, yet they show no sign of declining. Experts have been warning since at least 2011 that most of the world's fossil fuel reserves could not be burned without causing catastrophic global heating. In 2015, a high-profile analysis found that to limit global temperature below 2C, half of known oil reserves and a third of gas had to stay in the ground, along with 80% of coal. Today, the problem is even more acute. A better understanding of the devastating impacts of the climate crisis has led to the internationally agreed limit for global heating being lowered to 1.5C, to cut the risks of extreme heatwaves, droughts, and floods. In May 2021, a report from the International Energy Agency, previously seen as a conservative body, concluded there could be no new oil or gas fields or coalmines if the world was to reach net zero by 2050. More warnings soon followed. An updated scientific analysis found the proportion of fossil fuel reserves that would need to stay in the ground for 1.5C jumped to 60% for oil and gas and 90% for coal, while the UN warned that planned fossil fuel production 'vastly exceeds' the limit needed for 1.5C. In April, shocked by the latest IPCC report that said it was 'now or never' to start slashing emissions, Guterres launched an outspoken attack on companies and governments whose climate actions did not match their words. 'Simply put, they are lying, and the results will be catastrophic,' he said. 'Investing in new fossil fuels infrastructure is moral and economic madness. 'Climate activists are sometimes depicted as dangerous radicals. But the truly dangerous radicals are the countries that are increasing the production of fossil fuels.' The reaction to Russia's war in Ukraine has pushed oil and gas prices even higher, further incentivising bets on new fields and infrastructure that would last decades.  The failure of countries to 'build back greener' after the Covid-19 pandemic or the 2008 financial crash was not a good omen, and Guterres said: 'Fossil fuel interests are now cynically using the war in Ukraine to lock in a high-carbon future.' Assessing future oil and gas developments is challenging: the sector is complex and often secretive, public information is scarce and hard to find and assess. But a global team of Guardian environment reporters has worked with leading thinktanks, analysts and academics across the world over the past five months and now we can answer a series of questions that reveal the scale of the sector's plans. First, how much production is due to come from the projects that are likely to start drilling before the end of this crucial decade? Next, where exactly are the biggest projects around the world, the so-called carbon bombs that would explode the climate? We also followed the money: how much is going to be spent on oil and gas that cannot be burned safely, rather than invested in clean energy? And who benefits most from the fossil fuel subsidies that hide the true damage they cause? The answers to these key questions lead to an inescapable conclusion: if the projects go ahead, they will blow the world's rapidly shrinking cap on emissions that must be kept to enable a liveable future - known as the carbon budget. For all the promises made by many oil companies, the data shows they remain committed to their core business despite the consequences. The short-term expansion plans of oil and gas companies, such as ExxonMobil and Gazprom, are colossal. The Guardian's investigation has found that in the next seven or so years, they are likely to start producing oil and gas from projects that would ultimately deliver 192bn barrels, the equivalent of a decade of today's emissions from China. This estimate was provided by analysts at Urgewald, who used data from Rystad Energy, the industry standard source but not publicly available. Their Gogel database includes 887 companies that explore for and produce oil and gas, and covers 97% of short-term expansion plans. The companies have made a final financial commitment to projects that will deliver 116bn barrels, more than half of the 192bn barrel total. They have also invested heavily in the rest, including final development, engineering and operation plans. Such investment makes these projects likely to go ahead, barring drastic government action, Urgewald says. A third of the short-term expansion plans of oil and gas would come from 'unconventional' and riskier sources. These include fracking and ultra-deep offshore drilling, which are inherently more dangerous - as the oil and gas companies drill deeper, the number of spills, injuries and blowouts increase.  The 192bn barrels are split roughly 50:50 between liquids, including crude oil, and gas. Burning this would produce 73bn tonnes of CO2. But methane routinely leaks from gas operations and is a powerful greenhouse gas, trapping 86 times more heat than CO2 over 20 years. Including this impact, at a standard supply-chain leak rate of 2.3%, means the equivalent of 97bn tonnes of CO2 added to the atmosphere and driving us faster towards climate hell. State oil companies lead the Urgewald short-term expansion list, with Qatar Energy, Russia's Gazprom and Saudi Aramco the top three. Half of Gazprom's projected expansion is in the fragile Arctic, though the long-term implications of Russia's war in Ukraine on its fossil fuel plans remain to be seen. The listed oil majors ExxonMobil, Total, Chevron, Shell and BP are all in the top 10. Unconventional and risky oil and gas production accounts for about 70% of the US majors' totals, while the proportion of fracking and ultra-deep water ranges from 30% to 60% for the European companies. 'Most oil and gas companies are just proceeding with business as usual,' Nils Bartsch at Urgewald said. 'Some just do not care. Some do not see their responsibility because governments around the world let them proceed, although of course these governments are often influenced by the industry.' Two-thirds of the 116bn barrels of oil and gas projects companies are financially committed to are in the Middle East, Russia and North America, according to data provided by Rystad Energy. Australia is anticipated to be a big contributor with 3.4bn barrels, more than from the whole of Europe, where fields are relatively depleted. A separate analysis for the Guardian by Urgewald on the average annual investment in oil and gas exploration over the past three years shows that, along with Shell, three large but rarely scrutinised Chinese companies occupy the top four slots: PetroChina, China National Offshore Oil Corporation, and Sinopec. Seven of the top 10 of these explorers are relying on fracking, ultra-deep water Arctic and tar sands developments for more than half of their expansion. Daniel Ribeiro has been fighting plans for a massive offshore pipeline and liquefied natural gas plant in Cabo Delgado province, Mozambique, since it was mooted more than 15 years ago. The scheme, which would lead to a huge increase in carbon emissions in one of the poorest and most climate-vulnerable countries, is backed by more than PS1bn from the UK government and has some of the biggest oil and gas corporations circling, scenting another huge payday. 'It is already creating a massive amount of disruption for the local fishing and subsistence farmers who are being moved off their land,' said Ribeiro, from the local Justica Ambiental campaign group. 'But if it goes ahead and countries like Mozambique are set off on a fossil fuel track, it will be a global disaster. We can forget tackling the climate crisis ... we will all suffer.' Research shared exclusively with the Guardian has identified the Cabo Delgado development as one of 195 carbon bombs, which - unless stopped - will drive catastrophic climate breakdown around the world. The term carbon bomb has been widely used in climate circles for the past decade to describe large fossil fuel projects or other big sources of carbon. The new research sets a specific definition: projects capable of pumping at least 1bn tonnes of CO2 emissions over their lifetimes. Projects identified include the new drilling wells springing up in the Canadian wilderness as part of the vast Montney Play oil and gas development, and the huge North Field gas fields in Qatar - named in the study as the biggest new oil and gas carbon bomb in the world. The study, led by Kjell Kuhne from the University of Leeds in the UK and published in the journal Energy Policy, found that just a few months after many of the world's politicians positioned themselves as climate leaders during the Cop26 conference in Glasgow, they were giving the green light to a massive global expansion of oil and gas production that scientists warn would push civilisation to the brink. Asad Rehman, a leading climate justice activist in the UK who was at the forefront of a global network of indigenous activists and civil society campaigners in Glasgow, accused the US, Canada and Australia of 'rank hypocrisy'. 'These countries are single-handedly undermining efforts to curtail global emissions and ignoring their responsibility to phase out fossil fuels rapidly and justly.' He said it was the poorest and most vulnerable who were suffering. 'Only the colonial mindset of political leaders in rich countries can make the brutal calculation that the interest of fossil fuel giants and their billions in profit is more important than the lives of people who are overwhelmingly black, brown and poor.' Together these projects would produce 646bn tonnes of CO2 emissions, the study says, swallowing the world's entire carbon budget. More than 60% of these schemes are already operating. Kuhne, the director of the Leave it in the Ground Initiative, said in the first instance, the 40% of projects that had not yet started production must be stopped if the world was to avoid sliding ever more quickly towards catastrophe, adding they should be a prominent focus of the global climate protest movement in the months and years ahead. 'The oil and gas industry is continuing to plan these huge projects, even in the face of a burning planet. The ambitious targets of the Paris agreement were apparently not enough to make them question their business case. These carbon bombs are the single biggest indicator that we are not trying hard enough.' The study is based on data from Rystad Energy but, rather than focusing on total barrels, it identifies the mega projects potentially responsible for the biggest emissions. According to the research, the US is the leading source of potential emissions. Its 22 carbon bombs include conventional drilling and fracking, and span the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico to the foothills of the Front Range in Colorado to the Permian basin. Together they have the potential to emit 140bn tonnes of CO2, almost four times more than the entire world emits each year. Saudi Arabia is the second biggest potential emitter after the US, with 107bn tonnes, followed by Russia, Qatar, Iraq, Canada, China and Brazil. Australia, widely condemned by international leaders as a laggard in addressing the climate crisis, ranks 16th.  Robyn Churnside, a Ngarluma elder on the Burrup peninsula in remote north-west Australia, has been fighting fossil fuel and mining developments since the 1970s. She is part of a campaign trying to stop Woodside's US$12bn Scarborough gas project, one of the biggest fossil fuel developments in the country in a decade. Churnside said dissenting Indigenous voices were too often ignored when decisions were made about new oil and gas infrastructure that could lock in emissions for decades and desecrate culturally significant sites, which in some cases had stood for tens of thousands of years. 'It's about time the world listened to First Nations people because we have been here a long, long time,' she said. 'Our spirit in this land will never rest. It needs protection.' Prof Kevin Anderson, from the Tyndall Centre of Climate Research, University of Manchester and Uppsala University, Sweden, said the scale of planned production in the face of all the evidence suggested big oil and its political supporters either did not believe the climate science or thought their extreme wealth could somehow protect them and their children from the devastating consequences. 'Either the scientists have spent 30 years working on this issue and have got it all wrong - the big oil CEOs know better - or, behind a veil of concern, they have complete disregard for the more climate vulnerable communities, typically poor, people of colour and far away from their lives. Equally worrying, they are disinterested in their own children's future.' When BP reported its quarterly earnings in a presentation to financial institutions in February, one analyst said he 'really enjoyed the camaraderie and the positivity that you're generating', before asking about the company's cash position. 'We've given you a lovely little chart,' said Murray Auchincloss, BP's chief financial officer. 'Certainly, it's possible that we're getting more cash than we know what to do with. For now, I'm going to be conservative and manage the company as if it's $40 [a barrel] oil. Anything we could get above that just helps, obviously.' At the time, the oil price exceeded $90; today it is $106.  The oil industry is awash with cash. The money companies have belongs to shareholders, including pension funds, or in the case of national oil companies, to governments and, in theory at least, citizens. But the investment plans of the biggest oil companies are sharply at odds with the goal of halting the climate crisis. Data obtained by the Guardian from the thinktank Carbon Tracker shows a dozen of the world's biggest companies are on track to commit a collective $387m dollars a day of capital expenditure to exploiting oil and gas fields through to 2030. A significant portion of this is for maintaining production at existing projects - some oil and gas will still be needed as the world weans itself off fossil fuels - but the exact amount is not publicly available. Nonetheless, it is clear that at least a quarter of this investment - $103m a day - is for oil and gas that cannot be burned if the worst impacts of the climate crisis are to be avoided, money that could instead be spent ramping up clean energy. Even more worryingly, the companies have developed further project options that might lead them to spend an additional $84m a day that would not even be compatible with a devastating 2.7C of global heating. The world's governments agreed in the Paris climate accord to limit global heating to well below 2C, and pursue efforts to limit the temperature rise to 1.5C. For the latter, stricter goal, no new oil and gas projects are possible. The Carbon Tracker data, compiled in September, uses a temperature of 1.65C to represent the well below 2C target and finds that 27% of the companies' projected investments are incompatible with this. ExxonMobil has the largest of these climate-busting investment plans at $21m a day through to 2030, followed by Petrobras ($15m), Chevron and ConocoPhillips (both $12m), and Shell ($8m). In terms of the most dangerous investments - those that could help drive temperatures beyond 2.7C - Gazprom accounts for $17m a day of this, ExxonMobil $12m, Shell $11m and PetroChina $9m. If governments act on the scientific advice to rapidly reduce carbon emissions by boosting clean energy and cutting fossil fuel burning, the companies would have to write off these colossal sums as losses, hitting shareholders, pension funds and public finances. If governments do not act, the companies could cash in as the world burns. Overall, the international oil companies are making the biggest bets, with almost 40% of their projected investments incompatible with 1.65C. ExxonMobil is particularly high, at 56%. The national oil company average is 17%, although 56% of Petrobras's planned capital expenditure is incompatible with 1.65C. 'Companies that continue to develop projects based on business-as-usual demand are betting on the failure of policy action on climate and underestimating the disruptive potential of new technologies, such as renewables and battery storage,' said Mike Coffin at Carbon Tracker. 'Such projects are either not needed or they lead to warming well in excess of Paris goals.' A separate recent analysis based on Rystad Energy data from April, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, found that 20 of the world's biggest oil and gas companies remained on course to spend huge sums - $932bn - by the end of 2030 developing new oil and gas fields. Freeing the world from the grip of fossil fuels is made far harder by huge ongoing subsidies for the fuels, making them far cheaper than their true cost when the damage they cause is included - especially air pollution, which kills 7 million people a year. The G20 group of leading economies pledged in 2009 to phase out the subsidies but little has been achieved. Hundreds of billions of dollars in direct financial support is received by the producers and consumers of fossil fuels every year - but they benefit from far larger subsidies by not paying for the harm burning fossil fuels causes. When the damage from the climate crisis and air pollution is accounted for, the fossil fuel subsidies reach $6tn a year, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Guardian analysis shows this is equivalent to $11m a minute globally, $4m a minute in China and more than $1m in the US. Guardian analysis of more detailed IMF data shows drivers in the US, Canada and Australia, along with Saudi Arabia, are the world's biggest beneficiaries of subsidies for road fuels, with some governments under pressure to increase these during the current energy crisis. The per capita subsidy for petrol and diesel across the population of Saudi Arabia was more than $1,000 a year in 2020. In the US, the road fuel subsidy per capita is $644 and about $500 in both Canada and Australia. Japan and Germany also appear in the top 10 of the road fuel analysis, which focused on the 54 large countries with more than 25 million people and that account for 90% of global population and subsidies. The UK per capita subsidy for road fuels was only $10 a year, indicating taxes on petrol and diesel in 2020 were close to the level of the damage burning the fuels causes. The US is also high on the list of the biggest per capita subsidies for all fossil fuels with $2,000 a year, behind only Saudi Arabia ($4,550) and Russia ($3,560). After these countries, only Iran ($1815) is ahead of Australia ($1730) and Canada ($1690). 'Taking the Paris agreement seriously requires a rapid shift away from fossil fuels,' said Simon Black, a climate economist at the IMF. 'Getting fossil fuel prices right will help enormously in accelerating this transition.' The shift from burning oil and gas cannot happen overnight, and a declining amount will still need to be burned during the transition to a net zero emissions global economy in 2050. The question is whether companies and governments are moving fast enough. The Guardian wrote to the oil and gas companies named in its analysis and asked for their response. 'Under the IEA net zero emissions scenario, and all Paris-aligned scenarios, all energy sources remain important through 2050, and oil and natural gas remain essential components of the energy mix,' said a spokesperson for ExxonMobil.  However, the role of oil and gas would be vastly reduced in 2050, and the IEA said: 'Beyond projects already committed as of 2021, there are no new oil and gas fields approved for development [in our net zero scenario].' ExxonMobil planned to invest more than $15bn on initiatives to lower greenhouse gas emissions over the next six years, the spokesperson said, including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and biofuels. The company aimed to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 but only from its own operations, not the fuels it sold, therefore covering only a small fraction of the emissions from the oil and gas it sells. A spokesperson for Shell cited recent company statements: 'As a result of [our] planned level of capital investment, we expect a gradual decline of about 1-2% a year in total oil production through to 2030, including divestments.' 'By 2025, Shell expects its expenditure on [low and zero-carbon] products and services across its businesses will have increased to around 50% of its total expenditure,' a recent report by the firm states. In 2022, the proportion is expected to be more than 35%. In 2021, 'Shell achieved its annual investment targets in renewables and energy solutions of $2bn-3bn', the report says. ConocoPhillips also cited a recently published net zero emissions plan: 'Our goal is to support an orderly transition that matches supply to demand and focuses on returns on, and of, capital while safely and responsibly delivering affordable energy.'  The document states that profits from oil and gas projects are significantly higher than from investments in renewable energy. ConocoPhillips has allocated $200m in 2022 to reduce emissions from its operations. To reduce emissions from the burning of the fossil fuels it supplies, the company advocates an 'economy-wide price on carbon that would help shift consumer demand from high-carbon to low-carbon energy sources'. 'Petrobras plans its investments considering that the Paris agreement will be successful and global temperature will be kept below 2degC,' a spokesperson for the company said. 'Oil will remain important in the coming decades, even in accelerated transition scenarios.' The spokesperson said the IEA's scenario for 1.65C indicated some investment in upstream projects was needed. 'We are planning for highly resilient assets competitive in scenarios aligned with Paris due to their low production cost and low emissions. Petrobras is following its strategy of maximising the value of its portfolio, [with 99% of the investment on exploration] focusing on deepwater and ultra-deepwater assets.' TotalEnergies pointed to its recent sustainability report, which it said 'showed our stakeholders that we are already on the right track'. The company has a target of a 30% cut in emissions from oil and gas sales by 2030 and to increase the proportion of its energy sales that are renewable from 9% in 2021 to 20% in 2030. Saudi Aramco and Eni responded to the Guardian but declined to comment. The other companies did not respond to the Guardian's request. The Guardian's investigation has provided an answer to the question of how great a danger the plans of oil and gas companies pose to the climate. But there is another set of questions, those for politicians and governments, that will ultimately affect the course of the climate emergency. Will the world's governments act to close the book on the oil companies' giant climate gamble? Will richer countries, historically most responsible for emissions, support a just transition for developing countries on the frontline of the escalating crisis? Would strong, immediate action lead to a financial crash, as billions of dollars are wiped off the value of some of the world's biggest companies? Or will more steady but concerted action wean us off fossil fuels rapidly, close the oil companies' cash machine and lead us into a clean energy future with a liveable climate? Only time will tell. But, unlike oil and gas, time is in very short supply. 'The world is in a race against time,' said Guterres. 'It is time to end fossil fuel subsidies and stop the expansion of oil and gas exploration.' Reflecting on the war in Ukraine, he said: 'Countries could become so consumed by the immediate fossil fuel supply gap that they neglect or knee-cap policies to cut fossil fuel use. This is madness. Addiction to fossil fuels is mutually assured destruction.' Additional reporting by Jillian Ambrose, Adam Morton, Nina Lakhani, Oliver Milman and Chris McGreal.", "a4f960495ec7f81a039e46a9949408e8e5d82a29afb31accb603f9ac": "Annette Arjoon is not anti-oil. The marine conservationist calls the vast new oilfields off Guyana's coast a 'blessing' that will earn billions of dollars for one of the poorest countries in the Caribbean, even as she recognises that pulling yet more fossil fuel from the ground will deepen the climate crisis. But Arjoon does have a problem with who is drilling the oil. She has seen firsthand what happens when the US's largest petroleum company descends on a small country bearing the promise of riches.  As ExxonMobil began drilling a vast oilfield offshore two years ago, the Guyanese government called in the Amerindian marine conservationist to help monitor the environmental impact of what is expected to become the company's biggest source of petroleum by 2025, outpacing even its wells sprawled across Texas. Arjoon, who leads the Guyana Marine Conservation Society, was not impressed. In time she grew to believe that Exxon was indifferent to the dangers of an oil spill to the coast and rivers of one of the best preserved parts of the Amazon biome, and of misleading her about its preparations to deal with such a disaster. She found the company's behaviour 'thuggish and disrespectful'.  'I can only judge Exxon by my direct and deeply personal relationship with them so far. They are not an honourable company,' Arjoon says. Suspicion about the oil firm does not stop with environmentalists. Guyanese politicians have accused Exxon of fleecing the country of billions of dollars by bouncing an ill-experienced government into a contract that pays far less than other countries earn from their oil. Then there is the pressing question of the future of the planet. With Guyana increasingly threatened by rising sea levels, Arjoon is conscious of the impact of Exxon opening a huge oilfield at a time when governments are being warned there can be no new oil or gas fields or coalmines if the world is to reach net zero by 2050. Liza-1 project, in the prolific Greater Liza area, was the first stage to begin production, with Liza-2 coming on line this year. The Greater Turbot discovery was announced in 2017, but is still not yet in production. Both areas are identified in research to be published this month into the world's biggest so-called carbon bombs - gigantic fossil fuel projects that would each result in at least 1bn tonnes of CO2 emissions over their lifetimes. Together they would contribute more than 2.1bn tonnes of CO2 emissions over the course of the project, according to the study, which identifies 195 similar oil and gas mega developments around the world. The Center for International Environmental Law has also warned Exxon's drilling and gas flaring 'may turn Guyana from carbon sink to carbon bomb'. Yet for all that, Arjoon is glad to see the oil flowing because right now, she says, Guyana does not have any other way forward. 'As an environmentalist with 35 years of experience in coastal communities through the length and breadth of Guyana, I see extreme poverty. Oil gives us a way out of that.' This drilling bonanza promises to earn Guyana roughly $150bn over the life of the oilfields, estimated at 30 years. For good or ill, that represents a huge change in fortune for a country of 800,000 people, where more than 40% live below the poverty line of $5.50 (PS4.20) a day. 'All of those that have exploited their oil resources to develop their countries should not be telling Guyana 'leave your oil in the ground',' Arjoon says. 'Norway is always used as the best example of a nation that utilises oil, and it is said that they have the best model for natural resources. So why should Guyana be any different? Who is to say that little Guyana, which has been blessed with so much abundant resources including oil, should not take advantage?' Others agree. There is a bittersweet sense that Guyana needs to hurry and get the oil out of the ground if it does not want to miss the fossil fuel party. After years of failed attempts, Exxon made one of the biggest offshore crude discoveries of recent times when it struck oil off Guyana's coast in 2015. Four years later, the then president, David Granger, proclaimed a public holiday, National Petroleum Day, to celebrate the first oil flowing from its wells. 'Guyana's future is brighter with the beginning of first oil,' he said in a speech to the nation. 'The good life for everyone beckons.' The government promised to set up a sovereign wealth fund, similar to Norway's, to transform the country with investments in roads, education and hospitals. Fossil fuel money is also being earmarked to develop renewable energy sources such as solar and hydroelectric for when the oil runs out, an irony not lost on Arjoon and others. There has even been talk of a $5,000 cash handout to every citizen, a small fortune for many Guyanese. Yet the hopes pinned on oil are tempered by Guyana's divisive politics, shaped by tensions between the descendants of enslaved Africans and Indian indentured labourers, and concerns about official corruption. For some Guyanese, their first encounters with Exxon have left them sceptical of the promises. A short drive east of the capital, Georgetown, George Jagmohan used to run seven fishing boats. He might be less angry about selling them off one by one since the oil drilling began if he believed in the declarations of a golden dawn for Guyana. 'Since the drilling started, the fish have gone. It's the blasting and vibrations,' says Jagmohan, sitting on a sea wall next to a clutch of idle boats. 'In another couple of years it will be finished. It never used to happen. People aren't stupid. I've been fishing for 40 years and it's not been like this before.' A few miles further up the coast, Steve Outar says his catches are down by about 80% but he has not laid up any of his four boats because he feels a responsibility to the crews. 'The fish production in neighbouring Suriname and Venezuela is still 100%, so why is it falling here? Because the vibrations are driving the fish and shrimp away. Some of my boats spend 18 days at sea but still don't catch enough fish,' he says as he cleans red snapper ready for processing as dried fish for shipment to China. 'Each boat has a captain and six men. That's 28 crew, and each of the crew has a family to support. If they don't catch, they get nothing. If we're out of business, they are out of bread.' Arjoon says overfishing and other factors have played a part in the decline, but she agrees that 'the massive seismics that were done in the early stages did have an impact on marine life, especially marine mammals. That was when you had an unprecedented amount of strandings of sperm whales.' But she says that when she tried to talk to Exxon about the timings of seismic explosions, to see if they coincided with the stranding of whales, she was fobbed off. And, like others, Arjoon fears not enough has been done in case of a spill that could devastate this coast. 'Exxon's modelling showed an unmitigated spill could impact the north-western part of the Shell beach protected area all the way to the Orinoco delta. What lies in between is a very special place, especially because that is where the largest national repository of blue carbon exists, at a time when our low-carbon development strategy has been expanded,' she says. The government says there is no evidence Exxon is responsible for reduced catches and notes that Guyana's overall fish production has increased by more than 10% from 2020, and exports for the fisheries sector have surpassed GUY$4bn. And Exxon said its 'first priority for every project is to put in place mitigations and processes that help to prevent adverse events by utilising the best technologies, equipment and people in our operations'. 'The Bank of Guyana summarises landing quantities in their annual reports on Guyana's sector economies; according to the data provided in those reports, fluctuations in the quantity of finfish and shrimp landings have been observed for many years. Oil and gas activities have not been included as potential factors.' 'We work diligently to avoid any spills. But should one occur, we are prepared to mitigate and resolve it as quickly and comprehensively as possible,' the company states. But Outar waves away officials' claims, saying that is not the experience of local fishers. And he does not have much faith that the promises made for oil will make up for the decline in fishing. 'Oil isn't going to help. It can make the country rich but the people won't be better off. We've still got to live day to day. We can't eat a new road,' he says. Jahmohan is blunter. 'Are you fucking crazy or what? It will all end up in the politicians' pockets. They'll be sitting there drinking champagne and whisky,' he says. 'They told us oil will make us rich. We've got gold, diamonds, sugar in this country. We should be rich from that but we're not. So why will oil be different?' Those concerns are more widely shared. Frederick Collins, the head of the anti-corruption organisation Transparency International Guyana, warned that oil 'can end up being more of curse than a blessing'. He points to the behaviour of big oil in the Niger delta, where millions of people live with flaring and spills but see few benefits.  Others look to the experience of Equatorial Guinea, which enjoyed an oil bonanza that in less than a decade transformed it from one of the world's poorest countries to the highest per capita income in Africa by 2008. But Human Rights Watch describes Equatorial Guinea's oil wealth as 'squandered and stolen' by the government, resulting in declines in healthcare and access to education. Vincent Adams, the former head of Guyana's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), says that should serve as a warning to Guyana as payments to its oil fund soar to nearly $1bn this year, permitting the government to increase its budget by 44%. 'It's not about the oil, it's about how you govern the country and how you govern the management of the oil industry. Oil is not going to be around for more than maybe 30 years. So the governance part of it is to make sure that we invest now so there will be a sustainable economy after oil is gone to attract foreign direct investment, to lay the groundwork in education, infrastructure, national security, health, agriculture,' he says. 'We are definitely not prepared for it. And the biggest frustration is that the government just does not understand what it takes to be prepared, and what it takes to govern under these circumstances to make the country a better country.' Confidence has also been undercut by the widely held belief that Exxon bounced a government lacking in expertise and desperate for money into a contract that serves the country badly, with the global human rights group Global Witness estimating that Guyana will earn about $50bn less than it would have done under a more common type of agreement. A Guardian/Floodlight investigation last year found grave concern among experts about the contract signed by the Guyanese government. Adams said he warned the government against the contract but it was afraid Exxon would walk away. The deal allows Exxon to deduct up to 75% of the earnings from its Guyanese wells as costs before the balance is split between the government and the company. It recently presented Guyana with a bill of more than $9bn for those costs, which the government admits it does not have the resources to audit. The offices of Guyana's president and natural resources minister did not respond to requests for an interview. According to Exxon, 'the terms of the contracts are competitive with other agreements signed in countries at a similar resource-development phase'. It added: 'Guyana's resources have been brought on line at a record pace for the industry, resulting in significant financial benefits for the government and its industry partners.' The project, after all, is steaming ahead. Guyana's vice-president, Bharrat Jagdeo, played a leading role in developing a low-carbon strategy and protecting the rainforest but is pushing for as much oil as fast as possible, telling a recent conference: 'Because there is this climate change imperative to decarbonise, our policy is to get as much oil out of the ground as quickly as possible. It sounds a bit harsh for those who think you should be environmentally sound, but that is the reality of it.' Arjoon will be watching closely. She calls the gap between Exxon's claims to prioritise environmental protection and the reality a 'disgraceful deficit', adding: 'I am not unaware that Exxon is here to ensure the best returns to their shareholders. 'Exxon is not here because they care about Guyana. But that does not mean they can treat us as an uneducated nation. We don't drink the Kool-Aid so easily.'

Potential tipping points - where gradual decline suddenly becomes catastrophic - include loss of wildlife, fisheries collapse and dead, polluted rivers, the watchdog said. The OEP is a new official body set up after Brexit to hold the government to account. Its first report, published on Thursday, says ministers have shown ambition but that action is too slow. The government launched a 25-year environment plan in 2018, but the OEP says persistent and worrying declines continue and minister must take the opportunities provided by the new Environment Act to implement urgent and coherent measures. 'We're asking the government to recognise that tipping points are fast approaching in some areas. Because if it doesn't, it's going to be so much harder,' said Dame Glenys Stacey, the OEP chair. 'When you get to very limited numbers [of wildlife species], the effort involved in turning that around is immense and takes an awful long time.' She highlighted ongoing damage to marine wildlife. 'Progress there has been stately at best. But the government can, in large part, arrest these adverse trends, if it has the will.' Stacey added: 'A sustainable environment is not just nice to have but essential for human wellbeing, progress and prosperity. Turning the tide to achieve this is exceptionally difficult, yet it is needed urgently for our wealth, health and wellbeing, and absolutely essential for the generations to come. 'The first 25-year environment plan was an ambitious attempt to confront the challenges facing the environment, but progress towards delivering that ambition has been too slow. 'We continue to see worrying and persistent trends of environmental decline. But with the Environment Act, the government has a precious opportunity.' Simon Brockington, the OEP's chief insights officer, said: 'A tipping point arises at the point where a very slow and persistent decline suddenly becomes catastrophic. We're seeing long-term declines in biodiversity and we're calling on the government to address those. The serial setting of catch quotas above catch limits over time can lead to fish stock crash and we've seen many examples of that.' He also highlighted seabed trawling, which he said 'destroys the integrity of the ecosystem', and the pollution of farmland and rivers with fertilisers and livestock manure. 'For tipping points, it would be those I would highlight,' he said. Natalie Prosser, the watchdog's chief executive, said the UK was one of the most biodiversity-depleted countries in the world, and air pollution caused tens of thousands of deaths a year. 'Changes in climate are affecting the environment and biodiversity. We are heading towards a major tipping point.' She said the government had missed many environmental targets, and funding for monitoring the environment had fallen in the last 10 years. The OEP report identifies six 'building blocks' needed to rescue the environment in the UK, including a comprehensive stocktake of the state of nature, a commitment to action from all government departments, long-term legally binding targets and accountability for delivering those targets. 'The building blocks need to be firmer, clearer and weightier and pursued with true determination and intent,' Stacey said. 'A lot of environmental trends take decades to become apparent and there are always more immediate pressures for government. So if we're not careful, the environment can always be second fiddle. We'll rue the day that we don't take stock and address that.' Richard Benwell, the head of Wildlife and Countryside Link, a coalition of 65 nature and conservation charities, said: 'It has been 10 years since the government promised to pass on the environment in better condition - 10 years in which biodiversity has continued to decline. The OEP poses a simple challenge: that overarching ambition must now be rooted in ambitious targets and an urgent delivery strategy.' Joan Edwards, of the Wildlife Trusts, said: 'For all the initial promise of the 25-year environment plan, the government has been seriously dragging its feet. Targets for reversing nature's decline are so unambitious that in 20 years' time we could have even less wildlife than we have now. The steps outlined by the OEP provide a framework for government to deliver on its promises, but we need much greater political willpower.' Environment minister Rebecca Pow said: 'We welcome this report, which acknowledges that our Environment Act gives us new tools to make a real difference to our environment, putting it at the heart of government and transitioning us to a sustainable future with nature on the road to recovery during this decade. We are currently consulting on legally binding environmental targets, which include a world-leading target to halt species decline by 2030.'", "48017165010e12ca67cae67b2140f2161c8b41cee42ede6a2ace361d": "The 20-year manhunt for one of the world's most brutal killers has come to a decisive end in an overgrown cemetery outside Harare. The body of Protais Mpiranya, the former commander of the Rwandan presidential guard indicted for genocide, lay buried under a stone slab bearing a false name, which UN investigators tracked down and identified with the help of a critical lead found on a confiscated computer: the hand-drawn design for Mpiranya's tombstone. His body was exhumed last month at the request of UN investigators, and Mpiranya's identity was confirmed by DNA analysis on Tuesday. Serge Brammertz, the UN prosecutor who led the hunt, said he was the last of the major fugitives and finding his body 'provides the solace of knowing that he cannot cause further harm'. The man charged with overseeing the slaughter of thousands of Rwandans, and abetting the murder of many more, died in Harare in October 2006 of a heart attack brought on by tuberculosis, at the age of 50. But his death, like much of his life, had been swathed in secrecy by his family and supporters. Mpiranya had been living in Zimbabwe under an assumed identity for four years, despite its government's insistence that he was not in the country. The investigation that followed his trail all the way to the grave in Granville cemetery on the southern edge of Harare found he had arrived on a Zimbabwean military plane and had been in frequent contact during his stay with Zimbabwean officials in the then president Robert Mugabe's regime who were well aware of his identity as a valued ally in the second Congo war of 1998-2003. 'That the Zimbabweans, at least elements of the authorities, knew he was in Harare is obvious,' said a senior official involved in the investigation. 'He was even seen meeting with Zimbabwean officials. Of course he was trying to hide his identity from the public, but the entire reason he went to Zimbabwe is because of his relationships there.' The Guardian has asked the Zimbabwean government for comment. As a fugitive, Mpiranya had outlasted the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, established in 1994 to bring the genocidaires to justice after the genocide that killed up to 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. It had indicted him on eight counts, including genocide and crimes against humanity, but was unable to find him to make him stand trial. After the tribunal closed in 2015, a 'residual mechanism' was set up to wrap up old cases, and part of that mechanism was a small tracking team under Brammertz's command as chief prosecutor. At 7am on 7 February, members of the team arrived at the cemetery, where the graves were invisible beneath head-high grass. It took two and a half hours to find what they were looking for: a black headstone in memory of a Sambao Ndume whose date of birth matched Mpiranya's, 30 May 1956. A team member recalled the discovery of the grave: 'There was that moment when my colleague called out: 'Found it!' And we all just stood there looking at it. It was exactly as we thought it would be,' he said. 'All that hard work, the ups and the downs, it had led to this moment.' The French inscription on the tombstone read: 'Here rests forever one who loved his fatherland, his people and his family, more than his own life.' Below that, a crude depiction of a warrior with bow and arrow was carved with the message: 'Dad RIP'. The path that had led the trackers to the grave was long, convoluted and dotted with dead ends. There were supposedly eyewitness reports from across Africa from people claiming to have seen him, and until late last year the investigators believed he was probably still alive, hiding out in Zimbabwe with his fellow combatants from the Congo war. By May 2020, Mpiranya was the last major fugitive among the 93 accused indicted by the ICTR, and the most wanted war crimes suspect in the world. As head of the Rwandan presidential guard in 1994, according to his indictment, he had given his men a kill list of prominent Tutsis and orders to kill their families too. He armed and trained the notorious Interahamwe Hutu militia, responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths. And with the signal for the bloodletting to begin, the shooting down of the plane carrying the country's president, Juvenal Habyarimana, on 5 April 1994, he sent his men to set up roadblocks at which Tutsis were massacred. Soldiers from the presidential guard murdered the prime minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, a moderate Hutu, and mutilated her body. The 10 lightly armed Belgian soldiers who had been sent to protect her were shot and hacked to death with machetes. After the fall of the Hutu regime in July 1994, Mpiranya fled across Africa, spending four years in Cameroon until it became inhospitable for genocidaire fugitives. He moved on to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), fighting with Hutu forces and Zimbabwean troops on behalf of the country's president Laurent Kabila, against the Rwandan army, in what became known as the second Congo war. Zimbabwean officers saw the former commander as a cut above most of the Congolese troops they were fighting alongside . 'He developed a lot of relationships with these guys during the war,' a senior official in the prosecutor's office said. 'They respected him. He was a good commander, a professional, someone who listened, asked questions and took decisions. He was very security conscious. So he impressed the Zimbabweans when others they were working with did not.' So when Mpiranya was first indicted in September 2002, his friends and admirers in Zimbabwe helped spirit him across borders. According to witnesses, he flew from Mbuji-Mayi in central DRC to Harare on a Zimbabwean military plane. Mpiranya brought a small entourage of Hutu commanders with him and, using a fake identity, set up a small transport business with two large vans, bought most likely with proceeds from Congolese diamonds. He was better at giving orders than doing business. The venture floundered, and over the four years in Zimbabwe, Mpiranya's standard of living crumbled. Starting off in a substantial villa in the first year, the family had to downgrade to an apartment in the same area and then another in a more down-at-heel neighbourhood. They stopped hiring conductors for the buses and a family member had to do the work themselves. Then both buses were in accidents and there was no money to repair them. Much of the rest of his assets were wiped out by Zimbabwean high inflation in those years. When Mpiranya fell sick with tuberculosis, he had no money left to pay for his medical care and his wife in the UK had to take on more work to send funds. Filling in the forms for hospital admission, he used a new identity, Sambao Ndume, the name he would be buried under. The UN investigators believe his family and friends covered up the death so as not to dent morale among the Hutu forces in DRC - and so as not to expose themselves to scrutiny. The tracking team found several had secured safe haven in the UK and EU with bogus asylum claims. The tribunal tracking team spent the time chasing wispy leads around Africa, provided by informants either seeking to cover up Mpiranya's death, or looking to make money, or both.'The family and his associates deliberately concealed for the last two decades his presence in Harare and his death,' Brammertz told the Guardian. 'The investigative file was filled with information that he was quite active, with businesses and associates in several countries. My predecessors, and perhaps even myself at the beginning, focused more on those leads.' Over the past few years, the tracking team went back over the entire investigation, reviewing the databases, interviewing and re-interviewing witnesses, stripping out tips and speculation, and the investigators' own possible bias, back to the last fact in Mpiranya's life they knew for sure: he was in the DRC in 2002. They reconstructed every known detail of his life, his mindset and connections. The breakthrough came last September with the seizure of a computer and other material in a raid in a European country (which the Guardian is not allowed to identify). Combing through a mass of data, they came across emails with veiled references to 'the one who has a passed' and the 'old man'. Then they cross-checked with the travel of some of Mpiranya's relatives, from visa stamps sent by partner governments, and found them converging on Zimbabwe in October 2006. Sifting through hundreds of digital pictures, they found photos of a funeral including those of the body laid out for the mourners. It looked like Mpiranya and was dressed in a suit that the investigators later found in the grave. Finally, they found the photo of a hand-drawn picture of a gravestone, sent by a close relative, and realised it was a commission for the stone carvers of Harare. If they could find a stone like that, they could find the body. After years of stalling the search, the Zimbabwean authorities agreed to allow the body of the man calling himself Sambao Ndume to be dug up. On 27 April, the trackers, a UN pathologist, and three Zimbabwean detectives gathered at the grave as the sun rose. About 20 riot police had been sent along as well, torpedoing any hopes that it could be done quietly. The conspicuous police presence drew a small crowd of curious local residents. The gravediggers worked their way down to the coffin with spades, and then the pathologist took over, climbing down into the grave to take a careful sample, without disturbing the rest of the body, with a deference Mpiranya had not accorded to his multitude of victims. Prosecutors are still looking for five more indictees, and Brammertz believes the discovery of Mpiranya's body will increase the pressure on the governments of other countries, where the last ageing fugitives are thought to be hiding. But Mpiranya was the last of the main figures of the Rwandan genocide to be accounted for, although he had succeeded in avoiding a trial. 'Of course the goal is to arrest fugitives,' Brammertz said. 'But we need to account for them, one way or the other. First, because as they say themselves, survivors and victims want a final answer. 'And second, to say this person is dead means they can't cause further harm, and they aren't living this nice life as a fugitive somewhere while the victims try to rebuild their lives. 'And, of course, for the UN and our mandate,' he added, 'we have to demonstrate our determination and that we go all the way.'", "2cd575beb0c4781421ff4e01d9a4d004e5e97cfff0ffe3f8a6962787": "A female student in Nigeria was beaten to death and set on fire by fellow students who accused her of posting 'blasphemous' statements in a WhatsApp group, two witnesses have said. The school, located in Nigeria's northwestern state of Sokoto, was immediately closed down following the attack. Two suspects were arrested in connection with the murder of the student, who was identified as Deborah Samuel, said a spokesperson for the Sokoto state command. 'There is a WhatsApp group being used by the students, and her Muslim colleague student posted an Islamic piece. She criticised the posting,' said one of the witnesses, who declined to be named. 'She composed an audio that contains blasphemous comments on the prophet of Islam and posted in the group. That is what triggered everything.' School security and police attempted to rescue the girl but were overwhelmed by the students, the witnesses said. 'Police have fired teargas on the students ... then began firing shots in the sky to disperse the students, but they resisted,' said Summayya Usman Inname, a student in her second year. 'The police sacrificed the lady after the students began throwing sticks and stones at them, then the students used stones and sticks to beat the lady. After being beaten, she was set on fire.' The Shehu Shagari College of Education in Sokoto said in a statement that it had closed the college indefinitely 'following today's early morning student rampage'. The Sokoto sultanate council condemned the 'unfortunate happenings ... that led to the loss of life of a female student at the institution'. Nigeria is divided into a largely Christian south and mostly Muslim north. Incidents such as this are very rare.

The continued destruction came as a smaller fire broke out in California, destroying more than 20 homes, many of them multimillion-dollar mansions, in the coastal community of Laguna Niguel. New Mexico has seen an explosive start to what is expected to be another devastating fire season across the American west, with parched vegetation and gusty winds fanning flames that have burned for weeks. 'This fire is going to keep growing,' New Mexico officials said in a Thursday morning update, noting that more resources are being deployed to battle the blaze as another red flag warning was issued through the evening. 'The weather has been unfavorable for weeks,' they said. 'This will continue to cause extreme fire behavior and rapid growth, especially to the north.' The fire in California began on Wednesday when strong ocean winds sent embers flying, sparking flames that swept through the dry seaside bluffs and into the community. Though conditions improved overnight, by Thursday morning officials still listed the fire at zero percent containment.  Residents of about 900 houses were under evacuation in coastal California and one firefighter was injured, Orange county officials said. The wildfire has torched about 200 acres. Smoke from the blaze choked nearby cities in Orange county, and air quality officials issued an advisory through Thursday afternoon. Brian Fennessy, chief of the Orange county fire authority, said drought and climate change have combined to make fires that were once easy to contain extremely dangerous for people and property. The California fire was much smaller than the New Mexico blaze, which has destroyed at least 300 homes and other buildings since breaking out early last month. The fire is on track to become the largest in New Mexico's history. Rising temperatures have spurred desiccation throughout the west and drought conditions are only expected to deepen through the hot, dry weeks and months ahead. In its latest report, released on Thursday, the US Drought Monitor classified more than 40% of the west in 'Extreme Drought', up from roughly 35% last week. Nearly 60% of California was also in the category, a sharp jump from just over 40% last week. From New Mexico to Colorado and parts of the midwest, forecasters on Thursday issued red flag warnings of extreme wildfire danger because of low humidity levels, erratic winds and warm temperatures. The same combination of weather conditions have set the stage for spring wildfires across the US that have been more intense than in previous seasons. In New Mexico, the fastest-moving flames in the southern foothills of the Rocky Mountains were headed north-east and away from the area's biggest population center of Taos, a popular tourist destination 40 miles (64 km) south of the state line with Colorado. The winds have made it difficult for aircraft to fly to help firefighters on the ground, but some planes managed to drop retardant on the blaze on Wednesday despite winds gusting in some areas above 45 mph (72 km/h). Some evacuation orders were relaxed along the southern flank of the fire near the town of Las Vegas, New Mexico. Additional crews were on order to join the more than 1,800 personnel fighting the New Mexico fire, and forecasters said weather conditions should improve on Friday. The fire has already burned through a forested landscape, torching homes that have been in families for generations. Officials have predicted that the number of houses burned by the fire will rise dramatically when it is safe to do assessments of areas that are still smoldering. Crews were also battling a smaller New Mexico fire near Los Alamos National Laboratory, a government facility for nuclear research that has been tapped to ramp up production of plutonium components for the US nuclear arsenal. Officials and experts believe the risks for big blazes will continue through the south-west until the summer monsoon. In other areas across the west, where a rainy reprieve is less likely, the threats will continue to grow through the end of the year. The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) has predicted an above-normal fire potential lasting through the spring in areas from the high plains through the south-west. The threats will also linger farther west, into central Oregon and northern California this spring, and will only grow there through the summer and autumn. With the snowpack waning, the agency also noted that historic water sources used for suppression might not be available. 'There will be wetting rains in some areas but overall, it does suggest that it is going to be an active fire season,' Bill Bunting, the chief of forecast operations at the Noaa/NWS Storm Prediction Center, noting that the dangerous combination of strong winds, low relative humidity, and dryness fuels 'the rapid spread and erratic behavior of any fire that gets started'. 'It is just a reminder,' he said, 'you can have dangerous fire conditions any time of the year.'

Francisca Sandoval, 29, was reporting in Barrio Meiggs, a ramshackle market district in the centre of the capital, Santiago, when a group of men opened fire after a standoff with the marchers. A bullet pierced Sandoval's visor, leaving her fighting for her life in hospital. Two other journalists were injured in the shooting. 'Francisca didn't leave us, they murdered her,' tweeted Senal 3 La Victoria, the independent media outlet Sandoval had been reporting for. 'With these words we confirm the death of our dear Fran. We will miss you and will do everything possible to find the truth.' Two days after the shooting, Marcelo Naranjo, 41, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, illegally carrying a firearm and unjustified discharge of a firearm in public. Following Sandoval's death, Chile's public prosecutor confirmed that the charges would be reviewed. A Colombian and a Venezuelan citizen were also held under house arrest in connection with the incident. Sandoval is the first journalist to be killed in the line of duty in Chile since the Pinochet dictatorship. The last, Jose Carrasco, was kidnapped from his home 36 years ago in 1986, days after a failed attempt on the dictator's life. His body was found three hours later riddled with bullets - and so disfigured that even his wife was unable to properly identify it. In 2022's World Press Freedom Index, published earlier this month by Reporters Sans Frontieres (RSF), Chile plummeted to 82nd place - although still the fifth highest-ranked in South America. The report highlighted the overwhelming concentration of media ownership in Chile - a longstanding issue in the country, where two main groups dominate traditional media. 'Chile is living through a difficult period with regard to violence, and particularly violence towards media outlets,' said Carolina Munoz, director of the University of Chile's journalism faculty. 'This was evident during the protests in 2019, when we saw how journalists were hounded while carrying out their work, and we have also seen how groups formed to target journalists.' Chile's president, Gabriel Boric, 36, who had visited Sandoval's family at hospital earlier in the week, lamented her death and vowed that those responsible would be held accountable.", "076460a39ddf4db4a1dc9bc9647927fa00a01d8482ca31835d886f71": "A leading Turkish opposition figure has been banned from politics and sentenced to almost five years in prison, drawing widespread concern about a crackdown on leftwing organisers and politicians before elections expected within the year. An Istanbul appeals court on Thursday confirmed three charges against Canan Kaftancioglu, the head of the Istanbul branch of the main opposition Republican People's party (CHP), upholding her convictions for insulting a public official, publicly insulting the republic of Turkey, and insulting the president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in tweets accusing him of theft. She faces a ban on political activity and a prison sentence of four years, 11 months and 20 days. While she could receive a suspended sentence, observers fear that banning the key opposition leader from politics is intended to sideline her before presidential and parliamentary elections. Polls indicate that Erdogan and his Justice and Development party (AKP) are likely to face stiff opposition after a year in which Turkey's currency has halved in value and inflation has reached close to 70%. In response, Kaftancioglu tweeted a video telling her supporters: 'Never stop, do not give up, do not get tired.' She added: 'We will breathe together when we establish the rule of law.' Speaking in Istanbul the same evening, the CHP leader, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, addressed Erdogan directly. 'All this cruelty stems from your weakness,' he said. Kaftancioglu, an outspoken, motorbike-riding leftist, is thought to have played a central role in helping the CHP win the Istanbul mayoral race in 2019, granting it control of Turkey's largest city. The CHP candidate, Ekrem Imamoglu, won the seat twice after the AKP demanded a re-run of the vote when its candidate first lost. 'For Erdogan this is about the risk of the opposition continuing to organise effectively with figures like Kaftancioglu, who put together a masterful campaign to protect the vote and denied the AKP a repeat victory in 2019,' said Soner Cagaptay, an analyst for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. 'It was the 100,000 volunteers assembled by Kaftancioglu who observed the tally, compiled documents, took pictures and slept on top of ballot boxes so nothing could be rigged and Imamoglu won. It shows pretty significant organisational skills on her part,' he said. Kaftancioglu had already begun a campaign to train observers before the general election. The CHP was defiant after the ruling. 'If Canan Kaftancioglu is banned, there are tens of thousands of Canans who will be on duty during the elections at the poll stations,' said Unal Cevikoz, a CHP member and retired diplomat. Kaftancioglu's conviction comes after a recent ruling sentencing the leftwing philanthropist Osman Kavala to life in prison over accusations he supported anti-government protests in 2013, as well a demand by prosecutors to silence a leading feminist group. 'I feel like Erdogan is tightening the noose on the opposition's neck,' said Cagaptay. 'It shows that for him, the risk of letting the opposition flourish and organise outweighs the benefits of the investments he might get as a result of his charm offensive towards the west.' A court in Istanbul is expected to rule on charges against Imamoglu in early June. He also faces a ban on political activity and could be jailed over claims he insulted the election officials who cancelled his initial win in 2019. If convicted, the ruling would sideline one of the CHP's potential presidential candidates.", "bd0183cc8f156e4133be2ed6a183c162edaebcd80c95e137fd118342": "For the first time, scientists have grown plants in soil from the moon collected by Nasa's Apollo astronauts. Researchers had no idea if anything would sprout in the harsh moon dirt and wanted to see if it could be used to grow food by a new generation of lunar explorers. The results stunned them. 'Holy cow. Plants actually grow in lunar stuff. Are you kidding me?' said Robert Ferl of the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. Ferl and his colleagues planted thale cress in moon soil returned by Apollo 11's Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, and other moonwalkers years ago and the seeds sprouted. The downside was that after the first week, the coarseness and other properties of the lunar soil stressed the small, flowering weeds so much that they grew more slowly than seedlings planted in fake moon dirt from Earth. Most of the moon plants ended up stunted. Results were published on Thursday in Communications Biology. The longer the soil was exposed to punishing cosmic radiation and solar wind on the moon, the worse the plants seemed to do. The Apollo 11 samples - exposed a couple of billion years longer to the elements because of the lunar Sea of Tranquility's older surface - were the least conducive for growth, according to scientists. 'This is a big step forward to know that you can grow plants,' said Simon Gilroy, a space plant biologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who had no role in the study. 'The real next step is to go and do it on the surface of the moon.' Moon dirt is full of tiny, glass fragments from micrometeorite impacts that got everywhere in the Apollo lunar landers and wore down the moonwalkers' spacesuits. One solution might be to use younger geologic spots on the moon, like lava flows, for digging up planting soil. The environment also could be tweaked, altering the nutrient mixture or adjusting the artificial lighting. Only 842 pounds of moon rocks and soil were brought back by six Apollo crews, and most was locked away. Nasa finally doled out 12 grams to the University of Florida researchers early last year, and the long-awaited planting took place last May in a lab.", "caa7514c63ed041477079a27bb08ba4abd90546f5e274be10db958ac": "Iranian authorities have arrested a French teaching union official and her husband and threatened to execute a Swedish-Iranian man who has been held in jail for six years by 21 May, in fresh moves against foreign and dual nationals. The threat to execute Ahmadreza Djalali, a scientist, is widely seen as a reprisal for Sweden starting the trial in Stockholm of Hamid Nouri, who is accused of war crimes and murder committed during and after the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s.  The trial of Nouri, arrested in 2019 on a trip to Sweden, is seen as unprecedented. Iran claims the two cases are not related and says Djalali's death sentence will not be rescinded. The French foreign ministry has demanded the immediate release of Cecile Kohler and her husband, who were arrested as they prepared to leave Tehran for Paris on 7 May after a holiday in Iran. Iranian authorities have accused her of 'attempting to create political chaos' by allegedly associating with representatives of the Iranian Teachers Trade Association during her visit. The ministry has summoned the Iranian charge d'affaires in Paris to demand consular access to the couple. There are now four French nationals in Iranian jails. Days after Kohler and her husband were arrested the EU's chief negotiator, Enrique Mora, landed in Tehran to try to revive the Vienna-based talks on the Iran nuclear deal. Those talks have ground to an effective standstill over whether the US is willing to lift sanctions against the Revolutionary Guards. Activists say Iran is engaged in a brazen policy of taking foreigners hostage to extract concessions from the west. Iran denies any such policy and insists all foreigners are tried according to due legal process. However it has repeatedly shown a willingness to exchange prisoners and taken part in swaps in the past. Djalali was arrested in Tehran and charged with spying after a university invited him to attend a workshop. He has been threatened with execution before, but his wife, Vida Mehrannia, has lobbied hard to keep him alive. She says she might be prepared to see her husband swapped for someone the Iranians want released, but not for Nouri - the only swap the Iranians are likely to accept.  Djalali says he was forced to give a false confession under torture and threats, and his family vehemently deny the spying charge against him. Nouri has been charged with international war crimes and human rights abuses in connection with the murders of more than 100 people at the Gohardasht prison in Karaj. His trial is taking place under the principle of universal jurisdiction.

He is thought to have made the demand to ministers during an away day in Stoke-on-Trent on Thursday. 'We have got to cut the cost of government to reduce the cost of living,' he told the Daily Mail. He hinted at future tax cuts, suggesting the billions saved from reducing civil servant numbers could help fund such measures. 'Every pound the government pre-empts from the taxpayer is money they can spend on their own priorities, on their own lives,' he said. Johnson ordered ministers to return civil servant numbers to those of 2016 in the coming years, with staffing having increased by almost 25% to 475,000 full-time equivalent jobs. Ministers will have a month to put together proposals for how they will achieve this within their departments. A government spokesperson said: 'The PM and ministers are clear that the civil service does an outstanding job delivering for the public and driving progress on the government's priorities. 'But when people and businesses across the country are facing rising costs, the public rightly expect their government to lead by example and run as efficiently as possible.' Johnson has reportedly indicated the government was poised to cut taxes amid the cost of living crisis - but the idea was quickly shut down by the Treasury. 'We will have the maximum energy, effort and ingenuity to help the British people,' Johnson said the following day. 'You know the money we're already spending. Of course there will be more support in the months ahead, as things continue to be tough with the increase in energy prices.'", "cef02845df4d21d927982c4141e62441a6e1c3e0e0756a662cd2c3e3": "", "d67c3450785bde1cec0ed21fbe014af4520bbd7141b6f00fc77caaed": "An image of the supermassive black hole at the heart of the Milky Way has been captured, giving the first direct glimpse of the 'gentle giant' at the centre of our galaxy. The black hole itself, known as Sagittarius A*, cannot be seen because no light or matter can escape its gravitational grip. But its shadow is traced out by a glowing, fuzzy ring of light and matter that is swirling on the precipice at close to the speed of light. The image was captured by the Event Horizon telescope (EHT), a network of eight radio telescopes spanning locations from Antarctica to Spain and Chile, which produced the first image of a black hole in a galaxy called Messier 87 in 2019. Prof Sera Markoff, an astrophysicist at the University of Amsterdam and co-chair of the EHT Science Council, said: 'The Milky Way's black hole was our main target, it's our closest supermassive black hole and it's the reason we set out to do this thing in the first place. It's been a 100-year search for these things and so, scientifically, it's a huge deal.' The image provides compelling proof that there is a black hole at the centre of the Milky Way, which had been the working assumption of mainstream astronomy. A minority of scientists had continued to speculate about the possibility of other exotic objects, such as boson stars or clumps of dark matter. 'I'm personally happy about the fact it really drills home the fact that there is definitely a black hole at the centre of our galaxy,' said Dr Ziri Younsi, a member of the EHT collaboration based at University College London. To the untrained eye, the latest image might appear roughly similar to that of the black hole, M87*, but the two objects are extremely different, according to the EHT team. Sagittarius A* is consuming only a trickle of material, in contrast to the typical depiction of black holes as violent, ravenous monsters of the cosmos. 'If SgrA* were a person, it would only consume a single grain of rice every million years,' said Michael Johnson of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. M87*, by contrast, is one of the largest black holes in the universe and features vast, powerful jets that launch light and matter from its poles into intergalactic space. 'Sgr A* is giving us a view into the much more standard state of black holes: quiet and quiescent,' said Johnson. '[It] is exciting because it's common.' The latest observations also appear to show that our black hole's angle of rotation is not neatly aligned with the galactic plane, but is off-kilter by about 30 degrees, and hint at spectacular magnetic activity similar to that seen in the sun's atmosphere. Beyond the science, astronomers acknowledged an emotional connection with finally seeing the enigmatic object about which our home galaxy revolves. 'It's another doughnut, but it's our doughnut,' said Younsi. Despite being local in astronomical terms at 26,000 light years away, observing SgrA* turned out to be more challenging than anticipated. The team spent five years analysing data acquired during fortuitously clear skies across several continents in April 2017. Sagittarius A* is relatively small, meaning that the dust and gas in its accretion disc orbit in a matter of minutes rather than weeks, creating a moving target from one observation to the next. Markoff compared the observations with trying to photograph a puppy chasing its tail using a camera with a slow shutter speed. Scientists also had to peer through the galactic plane and filter out intervening stars and dust clouds from their images. Some combination of these factors - and possibly some extreme black hole phenomenon - explain the bright blobs in the image. 'We didn't anticipate how evasive and elusive it would be,' said Younsi. 'It was really a tough picture to take. It's hard to overstate that.' The EHT picks up radiation emitted by particles within the accretion disc that are heated to billions of degrees as they orbit the black hole before plunging into the central vortex. The blotchy halo in the image shows light bent by the powerful gravity of the black hole, which is 4m times more massive than that of our sun. Ultimately, scientists hope that observing a range of black holes - fairly dormant ones like our own and turbulent giants like M87* - could help answer a chicken-and-egg style question about the evolution of galaxies. 'It's an open question in galactic formation and evolution. We don't know which came first, the galaxy or black hole,' said Prof Carole Mundell, an astrophysicist at the University of Bath who is not part of the EHT collaboration. 'From the technology perspective it's mind-blowing that we can do this,' she said of the latest images. The EHT team's results are published on Thursday in a special issue of the Astrophysical Journal Letters.

I had to ask friends in Florida to bring one over for my son's 12th birthday. He loved showing his friends this device that looked like it belonged in the future. Our family has had plenty of iPods over the years; an early iPod with a click wheel, a mini, three Nanos, two Shuffles, and a Classic. My wife still takes her 2007 'fat iPod nano' on holiday as she doesn't like taking her iPhone to the pool. As a music player, an iPod has none of the potential distractions of a phone. No emails, no messages, and no notifications. It's a shame there will be no more iPods as there's still a place for a distraction-free music player. My 2007 black iPhone Classic is still permanently attached to the hi-fi in my car. It's a 160Gb model and contains my entire music collection - ripped from CDs - as it was a few years ago. The battery doesn't last, but that doesn't matter as it's constantly connected to USB power in my car. Andy Clarke, software designer, Wales, UK  I bought my first iPod in 2004 in Singapore. It was a 40GB iPod and came with so many accessories - a docking port charger, headphones, a protective carry case, you name it. I had all my music digitised and on my iPod - it was so easy back then. The wheel on the original iPods used to drive me a bit crazy as it was sensitive to the slightest touch; you'd try to move forwards on a playlist and you'd skip too many songs, so you'd try to go back but would go too far the other way. I still have my first iPod, and it still worked the last time I tried it. The biggest problem I have is finding a charger as Apple have changed them so many times. Sadly, I got rid of my docking port - more fool me. But I won't get rid of the iPod as it works and a museum might want it one day. I still use my iPod Shuffle - it's so much easier at the gym than a phone. I use my phone everywhere else, but I've found quite a lot of what I listen to is not available on Spotify. I'm sorry to see the iPod go simply because I can't afford what Apple charge for an iPhone with memory large enough to get all of my music and playlists on to. Elizabeth Dennett, 58, New Zealand The iPod arrived in that teenage sweet spot where music is everything. In the same way people venerate vinyl now, this was my format. I'd load up on CDs at Selectadisc in Nottingham, rip them to iTunes, shelve them and mooch off into college or town with the latest stuff blasting out. It's the device on which I formed memories with Radiohead, Wilco, REM, Bloc Party, Blur, Interpol, Franz Ferdinand, Beck, Gorillaz and loads of other bands that now seem really ancient. Shuffle was there for the quick five-minute blast between lessons or work shifts where you just needed to fill your brain with music, but I was almost always a snob about listening to albums from back to front. And always dreamed of someone picking up my iPod and commenting on how great my music taste was and asking me to marry them. Times change and it's a miracle to have essentially every song streamable in my pocket, with wireless headphones. But I'm also an old git now with responsibilities - and I miss the iPod days. Nothing will quite touch that feeling of powering around town filling my brain with endless new music on a distraction-free, dedicated, insanely cool, easy-to-use piece of overpriced tech that wasn't also a portal to social media hell. Matt, 33, reporter, Nottingham, UK  In the second week of January 2005 my father took me to John Lewis in Reading for the sole purpose of trying to find the elusive fourth generation 40 GB model. It had sold out everywhere before Christmas and I was desperate to finally get my first ever iPod. I'd been using a CD Walkman for years, but the iPod was tiny (for the time), sleek, intuitive to use, and looked like one of those futuristic devices from a 50s sci-fi comic. It went everywhere with me - carrying songs ripped from all my parents' CDs; Queen, Erik Satie, Bob Dylan, Weezer, the Rocky soundtrack, and eventually thousands of other tracks ripped from friends' computers using a rather cheeky piece of free software called MyTunes Redux. The following year, it got crushed in a bike accident, but I woke up in hospital with it still playing next to me, screen cracked and the body split down the seam - my first taste of heartbreak. Seventeen years later, I still can't bring myself to throw the old 40GB away, so I use it to store camera memory cards in the cable drawer. I'm surprisingly heavy-hearted about it, and probably feel very similar to how people felt when the original Game Boy was discontinued in 2003, which marked the end of an era for iconic gaming devices. When the news broke about Apple dropping it, I admit, I went straight to the site and ordered a new Touch to keep in the cable drawer as back-up for when my ageing iPod Video finally calls it a day. I'm just not ready to switch systems. Alexander Lerche, 34, photojournalist, Doha, Qatar  I first saw an iPod in a client's office in 2002. I was totally smitten. My wife bought me my first iPod (20GB) for Christmas that year. It took me an entire weekend to upload all my CDs into iTunes to transfer to the iPod. Having lugged about cases of LPs as a teenager, I couldn't believe I had all my music in my pocket, available to play at will. I remember the thrill of opening the box - beautiful, smooth cardboard with the strap line 'Designed in California'. And then the gorgeous white iPod, which felt so good in the palm of my hand. I also remember paying a small fortune to have a car kit installed so I could play anything from my music collection while driving. When I first took my iPod to the beach, I enclosed it in a waterproof, shockproof case - I was paranoid about not damaging it in any way. The iPod was a real breakthrough, and thanks to technology I can now listen to anything at anytime via my iPhone or MacBook. I no longer use mine now - the battery can't be charged. But I will always keep my original iPod. Nigel Wilson, 66, yoga teacher, Kent, UK  My dad went to the States in 2004 and came back with a third generation iPod for my brother and I was outraged. He wasn't ever kind enough to lend it to me, but instead I would steal his spare set of headphones and just put the plug end into my pocket so I would look cool going to school. I had a friend around that same time and she had an iPod Shuffle which she was kind enough to lend, and I recall her love for Eminem. Even to this day, when I hear Eminem the memories of that Shuffle come back. When I eventually got my own third gen in 2006 I started to really find my own music taste for the first time. I used to spend hours uploading music from CDs and making sure every song had all the info perfectly recorded so I could handpick each one and put it cleanly into its appropriate playlist. I made lifelong friends in those early days as we swapped music and bonded over certain songs or artists. I still have all the music I ever loaded on to it on a special hard drive at home. My first album was Aladdin, the soundtrack.

Sunlight shines through the morning mist. 'Humans,' intones renowned primatologist Dr Jane Goodall. 'What unusual animals we are.' As the camera pans over a closeup shot of a male model's boxer briefs, the world's foremost expert on chimpanzees says, 'It's a big job making our world a better place, but getting started? Well, that's as easy as changing your underwear.' This 30-second ad, for Australian underwear company Boody, is now airing. Billboards from the campaign will soon be erected around Sydney and Melbourne. 'It's interesting,' says Associate Prof Michal Carrington, a researcher in ethical consumption at Melbourne University. 'Because you wouldn't expect Dame Jane Goodall to be fronting a campaign for underwear.' Elliot Midalia, co-managing director of Boody, says: 'We didn't want to just get any influencer or celebrity. 'Jane was the top of our list, and we're so happy that she said yes. We couldn't believe it.' Goodall's fee - a sum Boody are not contractually allowed to disclose - was paid directly to the Jane Goodall Institute. It's not the first time Goodall has appeared in advertising - she has also modelled for Stella McCartney and appeared in commercials for HP.  While the final cut of the commercial shows Goodall surrounded by models, the ad was shot in two parts. Goodall was filmed against a green screen in London, while the rest of the campaign footage was captured in Australia. Then, she was superimposed into the scene. 'She had a laugh about it, made a few jokes about how funny it was that she'd be out there with underwear models around her,' says Roy Leibowitz, one of the campaign's creative directors. 'She's so professional, it just seemed to come easy.' Goodall's outfit in the advertisement was also made by Boody. Midalia says they already had plans to make a turtleneck ('her signature,' as he puts it), but when the institute confirmed she would work with the brand, 'we quickly expedited that'. Carrington describes an endorsement from Goodall as 'significant'. 'Someone like Jane Goodall is not going to be part of any campaign that's going to detract from ... her credibility.' Boody is a B Corp certified business, a 1% for the Planet participant, and manufacture their garments from Forest Stewardship Council-certified bamboo. Midalia describes that ad's message as 'really about sustainability, about getting people to make a switch to an underwear that supports the planet'. While Carrington says the conservation message is important, she questions the efficacy of such a positive approach. 'Pulling my academic hat on,' she says, research suggests that when you want to engage people in an ethical decision, 'no matter what the message, or the cause, you really need to switch people on morally'. She notes that the campaign does not explain the impacts it is trying to address, from the destruction of native forests to the way cotton farming might deplete water resources. The most effective messages, Carrington says, create 'what we call moral shock'. 'This ad campaign doesn't really give that sense of moral shock, or that sense of why ... The sense that people in their own actions are implicated.' On the other hand, Carrington says, 'there is a whole argument going on about how much responsibility a consumer can have'. 'While it's great to see companies taking responsibility themselves and developing [more sustainable] products ... how much responsibility do we want to place on the consumer? 'From a cynical perspective you could say 'Well why isn't there legislation out there to stop the harmful effects of clothing?''

'Striking fear in the hearts of liberals everywhere,' the former president's son said. In the accompanying post, Greitens wrote: 'Striking fear into the hearts of liberals, RINOs, and the fake media.' Greitens, a former Navy Seal, shared the video even though a woman whom he had an affair with accused him of tying her up and tearing her clothes off without her consent, and his ex-wife, Sheena, accused him of knocking her down and hitting one of their sons hard enough to knock one of his teeth loose, according to an affidavit filed as part of a child custody dispute. She also alleged that he purchased a gun, refused to tell her where it was and threatened to kill himself unless she expressed public support for him. Greitens' gun-focused messaging is concerning, according to researchers who study links between communication and political violence, not only because more than a third of the mass shooters in recent years also had a history of committing domestic violence, according to a Bloomberg report. But it's also part of a significant increase among politicians - largely Republicans - in recent years in references to guns and threatening language in campaign ads, according to researchers. That rhetoric contributes to polarization in our society and can translate to physical violence, they say. Given the tense political climate, researchers expect rhetoric from rightwing political figures to continue to coarsen and lead to more violence before the pendulum swings back to a less charged time. 'Violence is in politics as a violation of the idea that people have an equal say in the political process of choosing their governments and of being able to express themselves freely,' said Nathan Kalmoe, professor of political communication at Louisiana State University and author of Radical American Partisanship. 'Clearly this kind of messaging, where you're calling out political opponents while you're shooting at a gun range, is a kind of a violent threat.' Since Donald Trump became president in 2016, the number of threats against members of Congress has soared, according to data provided by the Capitol police to news organizations. That year, there were 902 threats against the lawmakers. In 2021, there were 9,600. Republicans are also more likely than Democrats to think civilians may need to engage in combat to save America. A majority of Republicans support the possible use of force to preserve the 'traditional American way of life', according to a 2021 George Washington University Politics Poll. Among Democrats the number was 15%. When asked if a time will come when 'patriotic Americans have to take the law into their own hands', 47% of Republicans agreed, as opposed to 9% of Democrats. About one-third of Republicans also agreed that 'because things have gotten so far off track, true American patriots may have to resort to violence in order to save our country', according to a 2021 survey from the Public Religion Research Institute. Among Democrats, the number was 18%. But the use of incendiary speech to rile up supporters in a democracy did not start with Trump. 'Certainly, we've experienced time periods in the US that were as divisive and as polarized as today,' James Piazza, professor of political science at Penn State University, said. 'It kind of goes in waves. And if you look at the type of speech and rhetoric that politicians used in those previous eras of polarization and division, they look a lot like what you see today; it's dehumanizing speech.' Trump and other Republicans are using threatening language to tap into anger about the shifting demographics of the United States and the sense that a Christian way of life is coming under threat, according to political scientists. 'Trump played into that anger and amplified it and went much further than most Republican leaders, especially the most prominent, had gone in very explicitly making these statements, not just the election rejection, but also the other kinds of anti-democratic statements, including hostility towards various racial, ethnic and religious minority groups,' said Kalmoe. One key difference between the Trump era and other highly polarized periods is the advent of social media, which amplifies speech by instantly sending it to millions of people and often strips nuance from a statement, according to Helio Fred Garcia, professor of professional development and leadership at Columbia University and the author of Words on Fire: The Power of Incendiary Language and How to Confront It. 'There's a giant megaphone that is out there,' said Piazza, who authored a study on the connection between political hate speech and domestic terrorism. 'There really is a whole new realm of the ability to mobilize people, to radicalize people, to have more fringe voices play an outsized role in national discussions.' Greitens is not alone among Republicans in using such incendiary language. For example, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia, recently told Real America's Voice, a media group, 'The Democrats are the party of pedophiles. The Democrats are the party of princess predators from Disney ... Their identity is the most disgusting, evil, horrible thing happening in our country.' In interviews, political scientists said such language was occurring mostly but not exclusively on the right. But they struggled to provide examples of Democrats doing the same thing. In 2018, former attorney general Eric Holder, who served in Obama administration, said: 'When they go low, we kick 'em. That's what this new Democratic party is about.' 'Immediately the right jumped on him and said, 'He's provoking violence.'' Garcia said. 'Interestingly, the same people who said, 'No, Trump isn't promoting violence,'' criticized Holder. Given the charged political climate, the academics say more violence like - or worse than - the January 6 Capitol riot is inevitable. Piazza said this wave of divisiveness and polarization is reminiscent of the time before the civil war when 'you had similar politician rhetoric to mobilize voters and to demobilize and demonize the other side that resulted in political violence'. That said, Piazza does not expect something like the civil war to erupt. 'We do actually have pretty strong political institutions in the United States, and we have strong security institutions. The US military is extraordinarily professionalized, and the US military has done an extremely good job of being apolitical,' he said. Garcia also forecasts more violence. He thought the US could return to a more normal place after the end of Trump's presidency but because Trump still insists he won, Garcia thinks it will take more than eight years and further carnage for the pendulum to swing back to a more normal place. To avoid that, Piazza and others call for more regulation of social media. He is encouraged by bipartisan efforts to hold the companies accountable. He hopes the government introduces regulations so that a politician 'trying to rile people up for political gain or attention, or to raise money, wouldn't be able to get away with that on social media. They would have to really watch what they had to say in terms of demonizing others and engaging in hate speech,' he said. In the meantime, Greitens ranks third in the Republican Senate primary polling but still leads against Democratic candidates, according to FiveThirtyEight. Greitens and his primary opponents did not respond to requests for comment. In the campaign ad, Greitens and Trump switch from the semi-automatic rifles to handguns. It closes with them firing more shots and Greitens saying: 'Liberals beware.'", "9362248ba365faffe9469c056c899033e1a99016d1dc6247ed13f24e": "On an August morning in 1945, 600 metres over the Japanese city of Hiroshima, a small sun came briefly into existence. Few remember a sound, but the flash printed shadows on the pavements and sent buildings thrashing. The explosion - 2,000 times greater than that of any bomb yet used - announced not only a new weapon but a new era. It was a stunning military victory for the United States. Yet jubilation there was undercut by 'uncertainty and fear', the newsman Edward R Murrow observed. It took only a moment's reflection on the bomb's existence to see the harrowing implication: what had happened in Hiroshima, and three days later in Nagasaki, could happen anywhere. The thought proved impossible to shake, especially as, within the year, on-the-ground accounts emerged. Reports came of flesh bubbling, of melted eyes, of a terrifying sickness afflicting even those who'd avoided the blast. 'All the scientists are frightened - frightened for their lives,' a Nobel-winning chemist confessed in 1946. Despite scientists' hopes that the weapons would be retired, in the coming decades they proliferated, with nuclear states testing ever-more-powerful devices on Pacific atolls, the Algerian desert and the Kazakh steppe. The fear - the pervasive, enduring fear - that characterised the cold war is hard to appreciate today. It wasn't only powerless city-dwellers who were terrified ('select and fortify a room in which to shelter', the UK government grimly advised). Leaders themselves were shaken. It was 'insane', US president John F Kennedy felt, that 'two men, sitting on the opposite sides of the world, should be able to decide to bring an end to civilisation'. Yet everyone knowingly lived with that insanity for decades. It was as if, wrote the historian Paul Boyer, 'the Bomb' were 'one of those categories of Being, like Space and Time, that, according to Kant, are built into of the very structure of our minds, giving shape and meaning to all our perceptions'. Boyer remembered the unsettling news of the Hiroshima bombing, which occurred the week of his 10th birthday and shaped the rest of his childhood. Today, someone remembering the bomb that well would have to be 86 at least. The memory of nuclear war, once vivid, is quietly vanishing. The signs on the fallout shelters - those that remain - are rusted, and most of the world's population can't even recall an above-ground nuclear test (the last was in 1980). The bomb no longer gives 'shape and meaning to all our perceptions'; until recently, many thought of it only rarely. It has been tempting to see nuclear war as a bygone terror that no longer terrifies, like polio. Except that the threat of nuclear war, as Vladimir Putin is reminding the world, has not gone away. Russia has amassed the world's largest collection of nuclear weapons, and Putin has threatened to 'use them, if we have to'. The odds that he may are steadily increasing as Nato countries inch toward direct conflict with Russia. They are now sending Ukraine tanks and missiles, amassing troops in eastern Europe and providing intelligence that has allowed Ukrainians to target and kill Russian generals and sink a Russian warship. If this continues, the risk of nuclear war will be 'considerable', Russia's foreign minister has warned. 'The danger is serious, real, and we must not underestimate it.' Yet many of Putin's adversaries seem either unconvinced or, worse, unbothered by his threats. Boris Johnson has flatly dismissed the idea that Russia may use a nuclear weapon. Three former Nato supreme allied commanders have proposed a no-fly zone over Ukraine. This would almost certainly entail direct military conflict between Nato and Russia, and possibly trigger the world's first all-out war between nuclear states. Still, social media boils over with calls to action, and a poll found that more than a third of US respondents wanted their military to intervene 'even if it risks a nuclear conflict'. Nuclear norms are fraying elsewhere, too. Nine countries collectively hold some 10,000 warheads, and six of those countries are increasing their inventories. Current and recent leaders such as Kim Jong-un, Narendra Modi and Donald Trump have, like Putin, spoken brazenly of firing their weapons. After North Korea promised 'thousands-fold' revenge in 2017 for sanctions on its accelerating nuclear weapons programme, Trump threatened a pre-emptive strike, pledging to unleash 'fire and fury like the world has never seen'. 'This is analogous to the Cuban missile crisis,' one of Trump's former aides, Sebastian Gorka, insisted. Leaders have talked tough before. But now their talk seems less tethered to reality. This is the first decade when not a single head of a nuclear state can remember Hiroshima. Does that matter? We've seen in other contexts what happens when our experience of a risk attenuates. In rich countries, the waning memory of preventable diseases has fed the anti-vaccination movement. 'People have become complacent,' notes epidemiologist Peter Salk, whose father, Jonas Salk, invented the polio vaccine. Not having lived through a polio epidemic, parents are rejecting vaccines to the point where measles and whooping cough are coming back and many have needlessly died of Covid-19. That is the danger with nuclear war. Using declassified documents, historians now understand how close we came, multiple times, to seeing the missiles fired. In those heartstopping moments, a visceral understanding of what nuclear war entailed helped keep the launch keys from turning. It's precisely that visceral understanding that's missing today. We're entering an age with nuclear weapons but no nuclear memory. Without fanfare, without even noticing, we may have lost a guardrail keeping us from catastrophe. The nuclear age started at 8.15am, 6 August 1945, with the release of a 4,400kg bomb from a B-29 over Hiroshima. Forty-three seconds later, an enormous explosion shattered the city. That so much destruction could be wrought so quickly was shocking news, which until then only a small coterie of scientists and military officials had known. 'One senses the foundations of one's own universe trembling,' a New York paper wrote in reaction to the terrifying new weapon. What did the bomb mean? Atomic scientists, who'd had time to contemplate the question, rushed in to explain. The important thing wasn't that atomic bombs could incinerate cities - conventional weapons were already accomplishing that. What distinguished atomic weapons was how easy they made it, noted J Robert Oppenheimer, who had helped oversee the bomb's development. Atomic weapons 'profoundly upset the precarious balance' between offence and defence that had governed war hitherto, Oppenheimer explained. A single plane, a single payload - no city was safe. The implications were, the scientists admitted, horrifying. Albert Einstein had proposed in 1939 that the US government develop nuclear weapons, in order to ensure that Adolf Hitler wouldn't acquire them first. But immediately after the war, he worried about any country possessing such power. Along with many of his colleagues, he concluded that the only solution was a global government, sovereign above existing countries, that would hold the world's nuclear arsenal, enforce laws and prevent wars (other details were vague). One World Or None was the title of a bestselling book that Einstein, Oppenheimer and other scientists produced in March 1946. Even the head of the US air force contributed a chapter pleading for 'a world organisation that will eliminate conflict by air power'. Five months later, the world heard from another set of voices. The US occupation authorities in Japan had censored details of the bomb's aftermath. But, without consulting the censors, the American writer John Hersey published in the New Yorker one of the most important long-form works of journalism ever written, a graphic account of the bombing. Born to missionaries in China, Hersey was unusually sympathetic to Asian perspectives. His Hiroshima article rejected the bomber's-eye view and instead told the stories of six survivors. For many readers, this was the first time they registered that Hiroshima wasn't a 'Japanese army base', as US president Harry Truman had described it when announcing the bombing, but a city of civilians - doctors, seamstresses, factory workers - who had watched loved ones die. Nor did they die cleanly, vaporised in the puff of a mushroom cloud. Hersey profiled a Methodist pastor, Kiyoshi Tanimoto, who raced to the aid of his ailing but very much still-living neighbours. As Tanimoto grasped one woman, 'her skin slipped off in huge, glove-pieces'. Tanimoto 'was so sickened by this that he had to sit down for a minute', wrote Hersey. 'He had to keep consciously repeating to himself, 'These are human beings.'' Hersey's contemporaries understood the significance of these accounts. The New Yorker dedicated its full issue to Hersey's article, and within an hour sold out its entire newsstand print run of 300,000 (plus another 200,000 copies to subscribers). Knopf published it as a book, which eventually sold millions. The text was reprinted in newspapers from France to China, the Netherlands to Bolivia. The massive ABC radio network broadcast Hersey's text - with no commercials, music or sound effects - over four consecutive evenings. 'No other publication in the American 20th century,' the journalism historian Kathy Roberts Forde has written, 'was so widely circulated, republished, discussed, and venerated.' Tanimoto, boosted to celebrity by Hersey's reporting, made speaking tours of the US. By the end of 1949, he had visited 256 cities. Like Einstein, he pleaded for world government. World government: it seems now like a wild utopia. Yet an astonishing number of people - responsible, sober people - felt it to be the only way of preventing more Hiroshimas. Winston Churchill and Clement Attlee both supported the idea. In France, Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus championed it. France's postwar constitution provided for the 'limitations of sovereignty' a future world state might require. So did Italy's. Even in the US, which stood to lose its nuclear monopoly and global supremacy, support for a world state hovered between a third and a half in opinion polls. 'World Government shall come - this is practically the consensus in this generation,' wrote the University of Chicago's chancellor; he even convened a committee to draft its constitution. When candidates in the 1948 elections were asked if they favoured a global government with direct jurisdiction over individuals and peacekeeping powers, 57% said yes, including John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon. In 1946, the movie star Ronald Reagan donated $200 to the cause. Such enthusiasm, however, counted for little in the face of geopolitics. Rising tensions between Washington and Moscow erased the possibility of global government. Still, they didn't change the fact: across the west, leading thinkers felt nuclear weapons to be so dangerous that they required, in Churchill's words, remoulding 'the relationships of all men of all nations' so that 'international bodies by supreme authority may give peace on earth and justice among men'. For Albert Einstein, a world state was 'the only one way out': it was either that or annihilation. Yet the world state never came, and neither did another nuclear war. One of the most surprising and important facts of modern history is a quiet one: in the 76 years since Hiroshima and Nagasaki, not a single nuclear weapon has been detonated in anger. Most weapons don't work like that. Poison gas is one of the few other military technologies that, despite its effectiveness, has been shunned - the first world war was a gas war, but the second world war mostly wasn't. Yet even chemical weapons have seen intermittent use, as by Iraq in the 1980s or Syria in 2013. By contrast, the number of nuclear weapons used since 1945 is zero. Why? The conventional explanation is deterrence. The very thing that terrified Oppenheimer about nuclear weapons - that they made attacking easy and defending nearly impossible - meant that any country nuking a similarly armed foe would have to expect a counterstrike. 'Because catastrophic outcomes of nuclear exchanges are easy to imagine, leaders of states will shrink in horror from initiating them,' the political scientist Kenneth Waltz argued. This logic led Waltz to a counterintuitive position: nuclear proliferation might be good. It's not just that nuclear weapons deter nuclear weapons, it's that they deter major wars in general by making the risks too high. The greater the number of states with nuclear arms, the argument goes, the less likely we are to see violence on the scale of the two world wars. Conflicts have indeed become smaller since 1945. And although there have been border skirmishes between nuclear states - China and the USSR in 1969, India and Pakistan more recently - there haven't been full wars. The bomb 'gave peace to Europe', the nuclear physicist Abdul Qadeer Khan argued. Khan led Pakistan's nuclear programme starting in the 1970s and then transferred nuclear technologies to Iran, North Korea and Libya in the 1980s and 1990s. His active role in proliferation horrified many, but Khan felt that Pakistan's acquisition of nuclear weapons (it tested its first in 1998) had saved it 'from many wars'. By this grim reasoning, we might celebrate the fact that nearly half of humanity now lives in countries with nuclear weapons (and mourn Ukraine's decision in the 1990s to destroy its warheads). Yet central to Waltz's deterrence theory was that the 'catastrophic outcomes' of nuclear war were 'easy to imagine'. For Waltz, who served in Japan in the immediate aftermath of the second world war, no imagination was necessary. Others needed help. This is why John Hersey's Hiroshima article and Kiyoshi Tanimoto's speaking tours were so important: they turned nuclear war from an abstraction into a reality. It was a reality many lived with daily. Today, telling schoolchildren to hide under their desks if a hydrogen bomb strikes seems quaintly unhinged (though, actually, it's good advice). But besides whatever trauma they wrought, preparedness drills like that created a widely shared nuclear consciousness. People regularly envisioned themselves in the position of the Hiroshima survivors. And if they needed help, such films as On the Beach (1959, US), The Day the Earth Caught Fire (1961, UK), The Last War (1961, Japan) and The Day After (1983, US but broadcast globally) vividly dramatised what a nuclear war would be like. 'Is it possible never to think about nuclear weapons?' asked the novelist Martin Amis in the 1980s. 'The man with the cocked gun in his mouth may boast that he never thinks about the cocked gun. But he tastes it, all the time.' In the same decade, the psychiatrist Robert Lifton assessed the 'psychic toll' such nuclear dread had taken. Hiroshima and Nagasaki weren't just historical events, he argued, they were psychological ones, with rippling consequences. Living with the threat of annihilation threw 'all relationships' into question. How could children trust their parents to keep them safe or churches provide spiritual continuity in such a world? Lifton attributed the rise of divorce, fundamentalism and extremism to the 'radical futurelessness' the bomb had engendered. Maybe one could dismiss the fallout shelters as theatre and the films as fiction. But then there were the bomb tests - great belches of radioactivity that previewed the otherworldly dangers of nuclear weapons. By 1980, the nuclear powers had run 528 atmospheric tests, raising mushroom clouds everywhere from the Pacific atoll of Kiritimati to the Chinese desert. A widely publicised 1961 study of 61,000 baby teeth collected in St Louis showed that children born after the first hydrogen bombs were tested had markedly higher levels of the carcinogen strontium-90, a byproduct of the tests, despite being some 1,500km away from the closest test site. Unsurprisingly, nuclear tests stoked resistance. In 1954, a detonation by the US at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific got out of hand, irradiating the inhabited atoll of Rongelap and an unfortunate Japanese tuna fishing boat. When the boat's sickened crew returned to Japan, pandemonium erupted. Petitions describing Japan as 'thrice victimised by nuclear bombs' and calling for a ban collected tens of millions of signatures. Ishiro Honda, a film director who'd seen the Hiroshima damage firsthand, made a wildly popular film about a monster, Gojira, awakened by the nuclear testing. Emitting 'high levels of H-bomb radiation', Gojira attacks a fishing boat and then breathes fire on a Japanese city. Gojira - or Godzilla, as he's known in English - wasn't the only one awakened by the 1954 Bikini test. The test put Hiroshima back in the spotlight and raised the profile of its survivors. In 1955, Kiyoshi Tanimoto brought 25 women, the 'Hiroshima Maidens', to the US for reconstructive surgery. He appeared before 15 million viewers on the television show This Is Your Life and recounted his ordeal the day Hiroshima was attacked. (In an agonising moment, he was then made to shake hands with a surprise guest, a drunken Robert A Lewis, one of the two pilots who had bombed it.) As the anti-nuclear movement spread, 'Hiroshima' became less an unfortunate event in Japan's past than a semi-sacred one in world history, to be commemorated by morally serious people no matter their nationality. Tanimoto promoted 'Hiroshima Day' and by the early 1960s there were protests and memorials on that day throughout the world. Denmark alone held demonstrations in 45 towns in 1963. By then, Hiroshima occupied a similar place in public memory to Auschwitz, the other avatar of the unspeakable. The resemblance ran deep. Both terms identified specific events within the broader violence of the second world war - highlighting the Jews among Hitler's victims, and the atomic bomb victims among the many Japanese who were bombed - and marked them as morally distinct. Both Hiroshima and Auschwitz had been the site of 'holocausts' (indeed, early writers more often used that term to describe atomic war than European genocide). And both Hiroshima and Auschwitz sent forth a new type of personage: the 'survivor', a hallowed individual who had borne witness to a historically unique horror. What Elie Wiesel did to raise the stature of Europe's survivors, Tanimoto did for Japan's. In their hands, Hiroshima and Auschwitz shared a message: never forget, never again. Yet the analogy was imperfect. The European Holocaust was the work of many hands. Mass killing, ordered from on high, had to be carried out by countless willing executioners, who snatched the victims from their homes, stuffed them on to trains, kept them in camps, shot them, gassed them and disposed of their corpses. By contrast, the nuclear apparatus, once in place, could be set into motion by a handful of men in only a few minutes. This also meant, the world soon realised, that another Hiroshima could come by accident. The murder of Europe's Jews was many things, but it wasn't inadvertent. In nuclear standoffs, a plane crash, system malfunction or miscalibrated threat could all plausibly trigger annihilation. Nuclear standoffs are dangerous by design. As in the game of chicken, the point is to set off on a collision course and frighten your opponent into swerving first. 'Fill the nuclear glass to the brim,' Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev advised his colleagues, 'but don't pour the last drop.' Such brinksmanship requires leaders to quell their doubts, possibly even to convince themselves that they're willing to see the glass spill over. Perhaps some are. 'The whole idea is to kill the bastards,' said US general Thomas Power, when presented in 1960 with a nuclear plan designed to minimise casualties. 'Look. At the end of the war, if there are two Americans and one Russian, we win.' This is the man who led the US Strategic Air Command - responsible for its nuclear bombs and missiles - during the Cuban missile crisis. Generals like Power, tasked with winning wars, pressed often for pre-emptive strikes. Yet they were fortunately overruled. Deterrence is surely one reason why, but memory played an important part, too. At key moments, decision-makers vividly imagined what would happen if they fired their weapons. They knew what nuclear aftermath looked like. Even Truman, who had initially considered the bombing of Hiroshima 'the greatest thing in history', found cause for restraint. When the UN forces became stalemated in the Korean war, their commander Douglas MacArthur requested 'atomic capability', later explaining that he'd wanted to drop 'between 30 and 50 atomic bombs'. Although Truman readied nuclear weapons, he fired MacArthur and declined to use them. Why? Looking back, Truman complained of his 'locally minded' field generals who couldn't grasp what going nuclear would have meant. It would have meant an escalating war destroying cities containing millions of 'innocent women, children and noncombatants', Truman imagined. Truman 'just could not' drop the bombs, he wrote. And, he added, 'I know I was right.' Truman's successor, Dwight Eisenhower, felt the same. He built up his country's nuclear arsenal, but when his military advisers urged a preventative attack on the Soviet Union, he refused. He'd seen war, and he could easily envision a nuclear conflict. It would mean, he told them, a 'great area from the Elbe to Vladivostok and down through south-east Asia torn up and destroyed without government, without its communications, just an area of starvation and disaster'. He couldn't do it, either. Such familiarity with war's horrors proved essential in the Cuban missile crisis. The US placement of nuclear missiles in Turkey, followed by the Soviet placement of them in Cuba, brought the two powers terrifyingly close to war. But after a series of escalating threats, Kennedy's Soviet counterpart Khrushchev changed the tone with a frantic, personal appeal. 'I have participated in two wars and know that war ends when it has rolled through cities and villages, everywhere sowing death and destruction,' he wrote. Kennedy, as a fellow 'military man' who had also seen combat (Khrushchev mentioned this twice), would 'understand perfectly what terrible forces' could be unleashed. Kennedy did understand, and he veered away from what he called the 'final failure'. Yet even as Kennedy and Khrushchev were de-escalating their dangerous confrontation, a 'far more dangerous' one was developing at sea, the late historian Martin Sherwin has argued. Its resolution suggests just how important experiential knowledge has been in keeping disaster at bay. The situation involved a Cuba-bound Soviet submarine, carrying a nuclear warhead as powerful as the one that had decimated Hiroshima. The submarine, out of radio contact for days, had missed all the hasty diplomacy between Kennedy and Khrushchev. And so, when the sub's captain found himself beneath a US warship, he refused to surface when signalled. Instead, he stayed submerged while the US sailors grew more aggressive in their signalling. One skipper tried the unauthorised and reckless tactic of dropping grenades on the sub. The explosions were terrifying, and the Soviet captain understandably assumed the war was on. He ordered the torpedo readied. 'We're gonna blast them now! We will die, but we will sink them all - we will not become the shame of the fleet,' the ship's radio officer remembered him shouting. Firing the first nuclear weapon since Nagasaki at the US navy near Cuba at the height of the missile crisis would have almost certainly triggered nuclear retaliation. 'This was not only the most dangerous moment of the cold war,' believed Kennedy aide and historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr, 'It was the most dangerous moment in human history.' The disaster was prevented by a Soviet officer, Vasily Arkhipov, who by chance had been assigned to travel with the submarine. Fifteen months earlier, he'd served aboard a nuclear-powered submarine whose reactor coolant system had failed, exposing the crew to radiation and killing 22 of his 138 shipmates. 'He'd seen with his own eyes what radiation did to people,' his wife told a historian. 'This tragedy was the reason he would say no to nuclear war.' Now facing the likelihood of war in the Caribbean, Arkhipov talked the enraged captain down. It was astonishing luck: the submarine poised to start a nuclear war randomly had aboard one of the few individuals on the planet with recent experience of nuclear disaster. The ability to clearly remember and imagine nuclear war's consequences had been, once again, essential to averting them. In 1985, John Hersey returned to Hiroshima for the 40th anniversary of the bombing. He came to commemorate the past, but he found it fading. The survivors, on average, were now 62. Two of the six people he had profiled in his article were dead. Kiyoshi Tanimoto was still alive, but he was over 70 and retired. 'His memory, like the world's, was getting spotty,' Hersey wrote. By then, the above-ground nuclear tests had stopped (the achievement of decades of antinuclear activism and treaties). Apocalyptic movies continued, but more often featuring zombies, aliens, intelligent machines, diseases or climate change than nuclear catastrophe. Hiroshima's resonance, which once matched Auschwitz's, was growing muffled. Today, knowledge of the Holocaust is kept alive by more than 100 museums and memorials, including in such unexpected countries as Cuba, Indonesia and Taiwan. But there is no comparable memory industry outside of Japan to remind people of nuclear war. The result is a profound generational split, evident in nearly every family in a nuclear state. My father, born a month after Hiroshima was bombed, remembers going to a concert during the Cuban missile crisis 'wondering if I would survive to the end'. My mother had constant nightmares of nuclear war. By contrast, I was born the year the atmospheric testing stopped, and such thoughts never crossed my mind. The extent of my nuclear consciousness was the hours I spent playing a video game called Duke Nukem. That game debuted in 1991, the year the cold war ended and Mikhail Gorbachev declared that 'the risk of a global nuclear war has practically disappeared'. We should feel relief, but the dispelling of dread has made it hard for many to take nuclear war seriously. 'I hear people talk about nuclear weapons,' arms control expert Jeffrey Lewis told me recently, 'and it's just so divorced from reality.' They've become 'dead metaphors', Lewis feels, lacking the concreteness to disturb our thoughts or constrain our behaviours. With nuclear threats far from mind, voters seem more tolerant of reckless politicians. Donald Trump, a case in point, has made outrageous threats, praised his own 'unpredictability' in nuclear affairs and suggested using nuclear bombs against hurricanes ('you could hear a gnat fart in that meeting', a source told Axios). Yet in the energetic discussion about the risks of Trump's running for president in 2024 and winning, nuclear issues are far from central. Nor is it only Trump. The nine nuclear states have had an impressive string of norm-breakers among their recent leaders, including Trump, Vladimir Putin, Narendra Modi, Kim Jong-un and Benjamin Netanyahu. With such erratic men talking wildly and tearing up rulebooks, it's plausible that one of them might be provoked to break the ultimate norm: don't start a nuclear war. Caution does not seem in abundance nowadays. Invading Ukraine, Russia turned Chernobyl into a battlefield and recklessly shelled Europe's largest nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhia. The Zaporizhzhia attack unsurprisingly set part of the site aflame. It was 'the first time in history' that a nuclear plant had been attacked, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy pointed out. 'If there is an explosion, it is the end of everything.' But how guided are leaders by such fears? In the past 20 years, the US has pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and two of the three main treaties restraining its arms race with Russia (the third is in bad shape). Meanwhile, China has been developing aggressive new weapons. In 2019, India made an airstrike in Pakistan, the first time its planes crossed the military border in Kashmir - known as the Line of Control - since either state acquired nuclear weapons. India has 'stopped the policy of getting scared of Pakistan's threats', its prime minister, Modi, declared. India has the 'mother of nuclear bombs' and its arsenal is 'not being kept for Diwali'. The cost of the shredded norms and torn-up treaties may be paid in Ukraine. Russia invested heavily in its nuclear arsenal after the cold war; it now has the world's largest. The worse the war in Ukraine goes, the more Putin might be tempted to reach for a tactical nuclear weapon to signal his resolve. Already, Russia has threatened nuclear war multiple times, and yet Nato countries increase their aid to Ukraine. The 'current generation of Nato politicians', Russia's exasperated ambassador in Washington has complained, 'does not take the nuclear threat seriously'. Maybe they don't. Hiroshima lies just outside their collective memory. The oldest of the 30 Nato leaders, Joe Biden, was two years old in August 1945. The youngest, prime minister Dritan Abazovic of Montenegro, may not even remember the cold war, as he was five when the Soviet Union collapsed. That is what time does. Traumas fade, fortunately for us all. It is a profound achievement - though surely aided by luck - that no nuclear war has refreshed our memories since 1945. We should rejoice, too, that the looming dread engulfing past generations has largely dissipated. This is what we want nuclear war to be: an archaic practice, relegated safely to the past. But we can't drive nuclear war to extinction by ignoring it. Instead, we must dismantle arsenals, strengthen treaties and reinforce antinuclear norms. Right now, we're doing the opposite. And we're doing it just at the time when those who have most effectively testified to nuclear war's horrors - the survivors - are entering their 90s. Our nuclear consciousness is badly atrophied. We're left with a world full of nuclear weapons but emptying of people who understand their consequences. ", "ab2492f172a287482559fdba3c48e1d90ea17453a852ff7f6d03e7a0": "When Laurie Bertram Roberts was 17, she was sent home from hospital and almost bled to death. Pregnant and experiencing bleeding, she had gone to the emergency department of her nearest hospital in Indiana twice, and was told she was miscarrying, but, because a scan showed the foetus still had a heartbeat, she was also told there was nothing they could do. What she needed, in order to end a pregnancy that was ending anyway, was an abortion - but she says the Catholic hospital would not provide one. 'They had the power to end my pregnancy right there, when I was already bleeding fairly heavily, in a tremendous amount of pain. Instead, they sent my scared 17-year-old self, a mother of two already, home.' There Bertram Roberts collapsed. She closes her eyes, visualising the scene. 'I remember what it feels like to think you're dying. Laying on the floor, in my mom's kitchen, I passed out.' She was taken to hospital to have the emergency procedure that she could have had earlier. She had twins already, having got pregnant and married at 16 (though the marriage didn't last). By the time she was 25, Bertram Roberts, now 44, had seven children. She had wanted to terminate one of these pregnancies - her health was suffering so soon after her previous birth, and she was a single parent living in poverty. It seemed impossible to have another baby, but when she arrived at the clinic, she found she couldn't afford the abortion. 'I got turned away, and then I ended up being too far along. The trauma of that, even though I love my child ... I came to terms with having to stay pregnant, but not everybody does. I was fortunate - I had my mom and my grandmother to help me. That's the only reason I made it through. I can't imagine what it would have been like if I didn't have that.' Both these events - needing or wanting an abortion, but not being able to have one - crystallised Bertram Roberts's belief in reproductive rights, and set her on a course as an activist. Bertram Roberts, who identifies as a non-binary femme, is executive director of the Yellowhammer Fund, an organisation based in Alabama that provides abortion care and campaigns for reproductive justice. When we speak over Zoom, Bertram Roberts - warm, funny, just the person you'd want to get you out of a difficult situation - is at home in Tuscaloosa, with a Wonder Woman poster just behind her. The previous organisation she founded and is still involved with, the Mississippi Reproductive Freedom Fund (MRFF), is now run by two of her daughters. Since the draft opinion overturning Roe v Wade, which had established a legal right to abortion, was leaked, Bertram Roberts says: 'I haven't been able to sleep, but before this, I was having trouble sleeping.' In the states she has lived and worked in, abortion access has always been fragile, and increasingly limited. Mississippi has a 'trigger law', which means that abortion will be banned if, as looks likely, Roe v Wade is overturned. It will almost certainly become illegal in Alabama, too, as well as neighbouring states, meaning options for women - even if they could afford to travel - will become extremely limited. It will disproportionately affect women of colour, who accounted for nearly 67% of abortions in Alabama in 2019, and those living below the poverty level, who will be more likely to self-manage abortion with pills at the risk of being caught, 'and criminalisation is going to disproportionately fall on black and brown bodies, because it always does.' Forced birth, says Bertram Roberts, 'is going to kill people. You can't force people to stay pregnant and then not expect that people are going to die, when it's more risky to give birth than to have an abortion. And that's just in general, that's not even specific to black women.' Yellowhammer and MRFF have provided women with money to pay for not only the abortion itself (since 2020, Yellowhammer has had its own clinic, but both funds enable women to access clinics across state lines), but transport, childcare costs, and food. Bertram Roberts sees reproductive justice as all-encompassing - not just providing access to abortion and contraception, but supporting families to look after the children they already have. 'We're also doing work around self-managed abortion, making sure people know how to safely use pills.' Bertram Roberts was raised a fundamentalist Christian and grew up believing abortion was evil. As a child, she would go on 'plenty of anti-choice events. I got told that I was a survivor of the 'post-Roe holocaust'.' A grim smile. 'And they would specifically say to me I should be very grateful that my white mother decided to have me because she was pregnant with a black man's baby.' Then, she says, 'life happened, and I became a teenage mom and wife. I got pregnant again and again and again, and you just learned that no issue is as black and white as anti-abortion activists try to make it seem.' She has always been an activist - when she was about 11, she started a petition at school to get a janitor, who had been bullying children, fired. In her 20s, she went to a community college, and excelled, despite having her last two children during her time there. At 27, she got a scholarship to Jackson State University in Mississippi, leaving her children with her mother while she studied for a political science degree. She would call them every evening, and spend every night marking their homework. In her third year, they were allowed to come and live with her on campus. University - where she embraced racial justice and feminist campaigning - politicised her. As an older student, and mother of seven, young students sought her out if they were pregnant and wanted an abortion. 'When folks needed to figure out how to get to a clinic or how to get the money, I was kind of that person.' She was also part of a group fighting to get the university to take the domestic violence she had witnessed on campus seriously (before university, she had survived domestic abuse). During this time, a fellow student, Latasha Norman, was killed by her boyfriend. 'We could have been doing actual preventative work,' says Bertram Roberts. 'One of the lessons that I learned from that is that we help us. It's good to work on policy and within the system, but at the same time, we got us. That really influenced the work I do now.' She became more involved in abortion rights around the time Mississippi was considering the 'personhood amendment', which, had it passed, would have defined life as the moment of conception, but was rejected by voters. Involved with the local branch of the National Organization for Women (NOW), she was the only person who would go on television to talk about the incendiary issue of abortion. 'A lot of people had jobs to lose,' she says. Bertram Roberts was unable to work because of chronic health problems. 'You can't fire me from being disabled,' she says with a laugh. 'What are you going to do? Fire me from being a caretaker to my kids?' Funny and forceful, she is a natural communicator, and didn't go in for euphemisms such as 'reproductive health'. 'Abortion! Say the word, otherwise a lot of times people don't even know what you're talking about. So that became my job. I became the abortion lady of Mississippi.' By 2013, she was escorting women to clinics. What was that like? She pauses. 'I won't say I wasn't ready, because I knew what they [the anti-abortion protesters outside clinics] were going to be like, but I don't think I expected them to be so personal. It was like they did research on me - they knew how many kids I had, they knew when I had them.' Her teenage daughters would go with her and Bertram Roberts remembers protesters calling them 'jezebels'. 'Like, who does that?' she says. 'They would come up to [my daughter] and be like, 'how many abortions have you had to be so eager to kill black children?'' Bertram Roberts wasn't, she says with a wry smile, 'ready for them to lecture me about black history. The audacity of these white people!' They would tell her that one day she would be on trial 'just like Nazis. 'OK, thank you, people who think The Handmaid's Tale is a fanfic. Please get the fuck out of my way.'' She gets abusive emails now, including one this week that ended by saying her mother should have aborted her. She laughs and says, 'there's nothing like being so anti-abortion that you think I should be aborted.' Bertram Roberts was meeting women who were sometimes a few dollars short, sometimes more, who couldn't pay for their abortion, and so she would scramble to raise money. At first funding came through NOW, then in 2015 she established MRFF as a separate organisation. 'It really came out of seeing people who didn't have a taxi fare, who came hungry. The need is so great.' Sometimes accessing abortion would mean travelling for hours, and women would tell Bertram Roberts they had food for the trip, 'but really, what they mean is they're going to buy a box of cereal on their food stamps'. The reputation of MRFF grew; at one point, she says, it was getting 100 calls a week. 'There's just no way to get back to that many people, and we were out of money.' It had to close down for a few months to cope with the backlog. Now the MRFF gets about 20 calls a week, 'and we're able to help about half of those'. (Yellowhammer receives 50 to 60 calls a week.) The majority of women who access the services, she says, 'are low-income or working class and already have kids. They understand the decision that they're making. And some folks just don't want to have kids.' They have included women whose sterilisation surgery has failed. 'People who were using contraception and it failed, people who had their contraception sabotaged, young people who are preyed upon or assaulted, grandmas who thought they were in menopause. People who get abortions are the people you know. That's what I've learned doing abortion care.' Abortion, she says, is simply part of wider reproductive healthcare. 'You never know when a pregnancy that is going as planned will turn into a pregnancy where you need abortion care. The bravado that some people have to think, 'It could never be me ...' I didn't choose to need an abortion at 17. I was a fully pro-life, never-have-an-abortion person and then almost died because no one would give me one.' Ultimately, she says, nobody should have to feel like a choice was made for them. 'You should have support whether you choose to parent, or have an abortion.' She smiles, clearly frustrated by the fight but ready for it. 'I don't see what the issue is. What is so hard about this?'", "1f767ff6d9728fdc75eecd135065e3ac9711d6f6121c25e385ded91f": "The UK government is threatening to write new laws to allow it to unilaterally override parts of the Northern Ireland Brexit protocol due to concerns over 'peace and stability'. But what options are open to the UK, given the protocol was part of a legally binding international treaty co-signed with the EU? Catherine Barnard, a professor of EU law at the University of Cambridge, thinks there are five options to consider. Article 16 of the protocol This is the most oft-cited set of clauses allowing for 'safeguard measures' which could include a pause of the checks and controls on goods crossing the Irish Sea in the event of 'serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are liable to persist' or in the event that there is 'diversion of trade'. In a statement earlier this week, the government said 200 retailers had stopped delivering to customers in Northern Ireland. But while article 16 allows the UK to take 'safeguard measures', this has already effectively been put in place through earlier unilateral action to suspend the checks on many goods. The section of the protocol also requires the UK to give the EU a month's notice that it is invoking article 16 and the protective measures must be reviewed with the EU in the joint committee every three months. As a negotiating tool, this is not strong. But it could score points among unionists and Brexiter backbenchers. Article 4 of Section 7 (a) of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2018 This gives direct effect to the supremacy of the withdrawal agreement over domestic law. It covers all three elements in the agreement - the Irish border, citizens' rights and the divorce bill. To revoke it fully would be tantamount to walking away from the Brexit deal entirely. Using Section 7 (a) would be very serious because it would mean removing the entire agreement which would remove citizens' rights too. What the government could be looking at doing is just turning the agreement off in respect to anything to do with the Northern Ireland protocol. Section 8 (c) of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2018 This enables the UK to implement updates to any EU directives in relation to the Northern Ireland trading arrangements without having to go through an act of parliament. It results in what is known as 'dynamic alignment' of British and EU laws in this limited geographical area of the UK. Revoking the provision would delight the unionists who have complained that the UK's sovereign right to make its own laws for the entire country has been undermined by the protocol. Section 38 (b) of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 This is known as the Bill Cash clause, which recognises that the parliament of the UK is sovereign. While the clause has been frequently referred to in EU scrutiny committee hearings chaired by Cash, a veteran Eurosceptic, it has never been challenged. It is also seen as stating the obvious, and is unlikely to be the core of legal manoeuvres made by the foreign secretary, Liz Truss. Article 62 of the Vienna Convention Barnard thinks this is where Truss and the attorney general for England and Wales, Suella Braverman, could be focusing their legal arguments. The 1969 pact does not allow a country to withdraw from an international treaty on the grounds of 'a fundamental change of circumstances which has occurred with regard to those existing at the time of the conclusion of a treaty, and which was not foreseen by the parties, may not be invoked as a ground for terminating or withdrawing from the treaty'. In any case all parties knew about the divisions in Northern Ireland and the Belfast Good Friday agreement includes mechanisms to respect all parts of the community. Article 62 also warns that this 'change of circumstances' could not be a reason for walking away from an international treaty if 'the existence of those circumstances [which allegedly changed]' were an 'essential basis' of the consent of the two sides. As the protocol was all about protecting peace on the island of Ireland and ensuring no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, this may not be a watertight ground for disapplying the treaty.", "d75ab150358040bdb774c8b9935c88157b1c70bcc618c1540863c9bf": "It started in early May with a post on a Facebook page for second-hand goods in the Canadian town of Miramichi, New Brunswick. A hundred Canadian dollars had been hidden somewhere near the town's harbour, it said. The following days brought more clues for other locations. Some made sense. Most were maddeningly vague. A week later, the town of 17,000 has become gripped by a mysterious horror-themed treasure hunt, with thousands of local people grappling with a succession of clues - and the promise of a cash prize. 'I don't think anything of this magnitude has ever happened in Miramichi,' said Adams Robichaud, a high school student. 'And we just absolutely love it.' Robichaud has been unsuccessful in his attempts to find the money. But like others in the town - where many have felt stifled by Covid public health restrictions - he has been swept up in the excitement of the hunt. The game is run by a shadowy figure calling themselves Roman Dungarvan, and claiming to be a descendant of an Irish cook robbed and murdered at a nearby logging camp in the late 19th century. According to local lore, the cook's body was buried in a shallow grave in the nearby forest, but on the night of his death, the air was filled with the 'most dreadful whoops and screams anyone has ever heard'. The men fled the next morning - and the legend of the Dungarvan Whooper hasfascinated residents ever since. On the Facebook page Miramichi Mystery Machine, the younger Dungarvan posts messages with a distorted voice and the image of a hooded figure. Many of the competition's locations have a horror theme: one clue took the treasure hunters to French Cove, supposedly haunted by the headless nun. Another was the poster for the 1980 slasher film Prom Night. (The money that night was eventually located in an abandoned school building.) Tim Sutton, a local TikToker, found himself frustratingly close to one of the stashes of money. 'I was wearing my pizza costume - something I do for TikTok videos - and searched for nearly seven hours that night. I didn't find it,' he said. 'But it's not about the money. It's more about the hunt and getting out in the fresh air and kind of making new friends.' A few days later, Sutton successfully solved a different clue, and received the money via bitcoin transfer. Dungarvan has remained eerily close to the action, giving hints and directions to treasure hunters in real time.. 'One time he posted, 'Tim Sutton, you're going the wrong way.' ,' the TikToker said. 'Another night he said, 'Man in the orange shirt - you're close.' He's watching you.' Despite its forbidding persona, the Dungarvan character also has a softer side, reminding treasure hunters to socially distance when they met at a local Dairy Queen - and to tip cashiers. (Staff at a fast food restaurant told the Guardian that event brought in $50 in tips). On the Facebook group, residents have enthused about their new shared obsession. One woman described spending a rare day outside with her husband and children. 'They weren't glued to electronics - they were making memories,' she wrote. So far, six prizes of $100 have been discovered and Dungarvan says that this Friday - Friday 13th - at 7pm, the prize will be C$1,300. A posting for the event features an image from the Friday the 13th horror films, a warning that anyone with a heart condition should not participate - but also a plea for participants to respect the speed limit. Sutton admits the game could be a ruse put on by some local businesses or even the city. But he's already started trying to guess where the final payout could be hidden, drawing on his girlfriend's extensive knowledge of horror movies. 'There's so many different horror legends here in Miramichi that it's hard to know where to start,' said Sutton. 'But like everyone else, I know I'll be ready, sitting in my car on Friday the 13th at 7pm - and ready for anything.'", "aba570217c4be346b39f97c0105256240611b79b5b230a1b9f574a25": "A baseball signed by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has sold at auction for more than $50,000, with a portion of the proceeds going to Ukrainians displaced by the Russian invasion.

Kaplan is a well-known collector of baseballs signed by world leaders who rarely auctions his prized pieces.

The nearby tea shops do what they can to help, dishing out hot drinks to hundreds of people who have left fighting and drought in Ethiopia for sanctuary in Somaliland's border city. At night, families lie in rows on the pavements, huddled under blankets. In January, Anajow Abana travelled 300km from Tigray, in northern Ethiopia, to Somaliland. She and her three-year-old daughter are living on the city's streets, surviving on the charity of local people. 'We fled fighting and drought,' she says. 'The fighting was so bad and they killed my husband and two of my children. It took us 12 days to get here and was such a difficult time,' she says. Mimi Tadasse is also living on the streets of Borama. It took her 14 days to reach the city. 'We got here a week ago,' she says. 'It was a hard journey. We had to go through areas of fighting, and it was very dangerous.' Tadasse is from the Amhara region of Ethiopia, which has been engulfed in conflict during the war that began between forces loyal to the Tigrayan regional government and the Ethiopian armed forces in November 2020, and quickly spiralled to include a number of armed groups, regional militias and the Eritrean military. Mohamed Warsame (Baradho), the mayor of Borama, which is home to about 200,000 people, believes the number of refugees in the city is much higher than estimates. According to immigration officials, at least 10,000 people arrived in the first two months of 2022, he says, and many more will have crossed the porous border unofficially. Many refugees travel on to the capital Hargeisa and other areas, rather than staying in Borama. Some walk as far as Bosaso on the coast and try to get a boat across the Gulf of Aden to Yemen. From there, they walk to Saudi Arabia in the hope of finding employment as labourers or shepherds. People arriving from the Somali region of Ethiopia find it easier to assimilate and set up a shelter in the refugee camps, as they speak the language; it is much more challenging for those from Tigray, Amhara or Oromia. There are two refugee camps in Borama, where it is estimated more than 2,000 families reside. Some have been in the camps for more than 20 years, others just a few days. There is little infrastructure, but there is a school built by Unicef, and local and international NGOs have assisted with latrines and water points. The plight of the refugees in Borama is part of a growing crisis engulfing the Horn of Africa, where 16 million people in Somalia, Kenya and Ethiopia are in dire need of food. Consecutive droughts have exacerbated the effects of war, leading to water scarcity, livestock deaths, soaring food prices and acute insecurity. A poor start to the 2022 rainy season coupled with the war in Ukraine could have catastrophic results, Save the Children warned in April. The mass movement of vulnerable people over insecure border areas threatens to further destabilise the region and harm communities, with many migrants facing the additional threat of unexploded ordnance (UXO) and landmines as they move through unfamiliar territories. The border with Ethiopia has been heavily fought over since the 60s, particularly during the 80s and 90s, meaning former battle sites are heavily contaminated with UXO. Dayis Amin and his wife, Suldan, are living in a refugee camp in Borama with their eight children having fled a disputed area close to Harar, Ethiopia. They say they were unable to grow any crops because of fighting and drought. Amin says: 'It is difficult here. Some days we eat nothing. 'We had a good life before. We had 20 cows and 30 sheep. Then there was trouble, and we couldn't get by. We couldn't farm because of the fighting, so when the drought came all the animals died. 'There were also explosions where we were, from the fighting. About six months ago, a group of children were playing with a metal item just 150 metres from our house. There was an explosion and five children died.' Omar Mohammed, Somalia country director for MAG, a humanitarian organisation that clears UXO and landmines, says: 'Moving across borders into Somaliland to seek humanitarian assistance or better conditions is the only way to cope for these people - while the UXOs and mines litter both sides of the border from previous wars. The UN estimates there were more than 317,000 newly displaced people within Somalia in January 2022 due to conflict and drought-related issues. 'We are doing our best to keep people safe by advising them of the risks of unexploded ordnance and landmines in the border areas, but they face multiple other risks because of the drought. Women and girls are having to walk longer distances to access water, for instance, exposing them to gender-based violence.' In the town of Baligubadle, approximately 170km south-east of Borama, refugees from Ethiopia arrive on a daily basis, along with displaced Somalis seeking water and food. 'People are dying,' says Abdi Karim Mohamed, director of families and livelihoods for the local government, 'We don't have enough water and we need help. Our reservoirs are dry. We bring water trucks all the way from Hargeisa, but that is very expensive and we can't manage to do that very often.' The Abdi Rahman family have just arrived in the town and are setting up makeshift shelters. 'We had to leave our home because the animals were dying because of the drought,' says the family matriarch, Koos. 'We had 200 goats before, but now we have only five. We have one cow - we lost four. The first animal died three months ago and then more died as they became weaker. We had lived there for generations but every year it became harder and harder to survive.' Rein Paulsen, director for emergencies and resilience at the UN Food and Agriculture Programme (FAO) says: 'We are most definitely now sitting on the brink of catastrophe, time is running out.' 'Harvests are ruined,' says Michael Dunford, regional director for the east Africa bureau of the UN World Food Programme (WFP). 'Livestock are dying, and hunger is growing.' Should the rains continue to fail, it will be the first time in more than 40 years that four dry seasons will have occurred consecutively. For people like Abana, and the millions of already vulnerable people in this part of the world, that is a terrifying prospect.

Unicef's deputy executive director, Omar Abdi, was speaking at the UN's security council: The war in Ukraine was creating a 'child protection and child rights crisis', he warned.  Abdi also demanded an end to the bombing of Ukrainian schools, adding that one in six Unicef-supported schools in eastern Ukraine had been 'damaged or destroyed' as of last week.  He said: We will be pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine and returning in a few hours to bring you all the latest developments. In the meantime, here is a comprehensive rundown of where things stand as the time approaches 3am in Kyiv. The UK government has declined a Commons instruction to release information about the decision to make Evgeny Lebedev a peer, saying this would undermine the confidentiality of those nominated and could degenerate into 'political point-scoring', the Guardian's political correspondent Peter Walker reports. Labour called the decision 'a cover-up' and promised more action over what it called a contempt of parliament. The announcement said information had instead been provided to parliament's intelligence and security committee (ISC). This prompted an immediate rebuff from the ISC, which said its request for details about Lebedev was separate and should have remained classified. In March a humble address motion tabled by Labour was passed by the Commons amid a threatened Tory rebellion, directing ministers to release information about the elevation of the Russian-born businessman and son of a former KGB officer. The vote, in which Tory MPs were instructed to abstain given the extent of backbench Conservative disquiet on the issue, followed revelations that the intelligence services had concerns about a peerage for Lebedev awarded by Boris Johnson, a close friend. But a Cabinet Office document released on Thursday, running to nine pages, contained no new information beyond a handful of redacted emails, including one in which Lebedev confirmed he had completed a form, and another in which an unidentified official congratulated him on the peerage. Read on here: An update from US secretary of defence Lloyd Austin, who says he had a phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Oleksiy Reznikov: The call came as US plans for a $40bn aid package for Ukraine including money to boost the country's defences was blocked in the Senate by a single senator, Republican Rand Paul. AP reports: Relatives and supporters of the Ukrainian fighters holed up in the Azovstal steel plant demonstrated in Kyiv on Thursday, pleading for them to be rescued, Reuters reports. Russian forces have been bombarding the steelworks in the southern port of Mariupol, the last bastion of Ukrainian defenders in a city now almost completely controlled by Russia after more than two months of a siege. Many of the civilians holed up at the plant have been evacuated but no deal has been reached with Moscow on allowing out hundreds of fighters, some of whom are wounded. Demonstrators, mostly women, marched through central Kyiv, holding banners and chanting, 'Save defenders of Mariupol, save Azovstal,' 'Glory to the heroes of Mariupol,' and, 'Save the military of Azovstal.' Maria Zimareva, whose relative is among the Azov battalion fighters, said tearfully: People holed up in the steelworks were dying of wounds that could normally be treated, said Tetiana Pogorlova: Mariupol resident Alina Nesterenko was also at the demonstration in the capital: This is Helen Livingstone taking over the Guardian's live coverage of the crisis in Ukraine. A court in Kyiv will hear the first war crime trial since Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine when a Russian soldier accused of murdering a 62-year-old civilian appears in the dock on Friday, the Guardian's Daniel Boffey reports. The watershed moment comes as the number of crimes registered by Ukraine's general prosecutor surpassed 11,000 and Unicef reported that at least 100 children had been killed in the war in April alone. The defendant who will appear at Kyiv's district court is Vadim Shysimarin, a 21-year-old commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division, who is currently in Ukrainian custody. It is alleged Shysimarin, a sergeant, had been fighting in the Sumy region in north-east Ukraine when he killed a civilian on 28 February in the village of Chupakhivka. He is accused of shooting at a civilian car after his convoy of military vehicles had come under attack from Ukrainian forces. He then drove the car away with four other soldiers as he sought to flee Ukrainian fighters. Shysimarin shot dead the unarmed man, who was on a bicycle and talking on his phone, after being ordered 'to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders', according to prosecutors. Read on here: It's 6 pm ET here in New York. I'll be handing the blog over to my colleagues in Australia. Here's what happened so far:  More than 1,100 Ukrainian refugees have arrived in Wales under the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme, according to the BBC. Under the sponsorship scheme, 37,500 visas have been issued across the UK. For those visas issued for refugees to go to England, 49% have arrived, 28% of those planning to go to Scotland arrived and 16% have arrived in Northern Ireland. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy says Russia has destroyed 570 health care facilities and 101 hospitals, according to the New York Times. The remarks came during his nightly address to the nation. He also said some schools were struck on Thursday in northern Ukraine. Earlier today, the United Nations Human Rights Council passed a resolution to investigate Russia's human rights abuses in Ukraine in a 33-2 vote.  US Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky has blocked the passage of a $40bn aid bill to Ukraine. Paul demanded changes to the legislation that would include implementing a special inspector general to oversee how the aid is spent, according to CNN.  'We cannot save Ukraine by dooming the US economy,' Paul said.  Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer and Republican leader Mitch McConnell offered to allow a vote on the Republican senator's amendment. But CNN is reporting that Paul insisted that it be added to the actual bill. 'The package is ready to go,' Schumer said. 'The vast majority of senators on both sides of the aisle want it. There's now only one thing holding us back the junior senator from Kentucky is preventing swift passage of Ukraine aid because he wants to add at the last minute his own changes directly into the bill. His change is strongly opposed by many members of both parties.' Michael Carpenter, the US Ambassador to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), said that 'at least several thousand Ukrainians' have been sent to so-called 'filtration centers' in Russia, according to a transcript of his remarks to the OSCE Permanent Council.  'During this so-called 'filtration' process, Russia's forces reportedly process and interrogate detained Ukrainian citizens to identify anyone with ties to the Ukrainian government or military, as well as individuals with 'pro-Ukraine' convictions,' Carpenter's remarks reads.  Carpenter went onto say that residents of Mariupol were reportedly evicted from shelters and forced onto buses to these 'filtration camps' without telling them where they were going. 'Numerous eyewitness accounts indicate that 'filtering out' entails beating and torturing individuals to determine whether they owe even the slightest allegiance to the Ukrainian state,' his remarks continue.  More from his transcript:  Authorities in Spain have identified houses, companies and one luxury yacht belonging to Russian oligarchs who are on the sanctions list, Reuters is reporting. In the weeks since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Mariano Garcia Fresno, the head of the General Council of Notaries' money laundering prevention unit said the group noticed increased activity as oligarchs attempted to transfer ownership and stakes of businesses to relatives or associates.  More context from Reuters: Some interesting analysis from Michael Kofman, director of Russia studies at the Center for Naval Analyses in Washington DC, on Russia's mobilization problem in its invasion of Ukraine.  Kofman argues that Russia is currently 'operating at peacetime strength'.  He notes that Vladimir Putin seems hesitant to declare a state of war. Currently, Putin has designated the invasion of Ukraine as a 'special operation'. Reuters is reporting that Ukrainian forces have set on fire a Russian ship in the Black Sea:  Video footage shows the Azov fighters in Mariupol engaging in a counter-attack at the steel plant where hundreds of soldiers and civilians have been under siege.  Graffiti shows signs of Ukrainian resistance in Russian-occupied Kherson. This is Lauren Aratani taking over for Leonie Chao-Fong.  Despite sanctions and boycotts against Russia's oil exports, the country's oil revenues are up 50% this year, according to Bloomberg, citing a report from the International Energy Agency.  In 2022, Russia earned about $20bn per month in 2022 from oil sales. The revenue stream represents exports of about 8m barrels a day, according to the agency.  The EU - despite its stance against the invasion - has taken in about 43% of the country's oil exports.  Russia's supplies were down by 1m barrels a day last month, meaning that the country could soon see an economic impact from the sanctions and boycotts. ", "2df06bf2cc3f48816eb5317c9c139e82edc72182c2199a950ffedaf0": "Finland must apply to join Nato 'without delay' in the wake of Russia's attack on Ukraine, its president and prime minister have said, signalling a historic shift in the country's security policy that drew a blunt warning of retaliation from the Kremlin. With neighbouring Sweden expected to follow suit, Sauli Niinisto, Finland's president, and Sanna Marin, the prime minister, made the call in a joint statement, adding: 'We hope that the national steps still needed to make this decision will be taken rapidly within the next few days.' Nato membership would strengthen Finland's security, the two leaders said, and as a member of Nato, 'Finland would strengthen the entire defence alliance. Finland must apply for Nato membership as a matter of urgency'. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Russia would 'definitely' see Finnish membership as a threat, and the foreign ministry in Moscow said it would have to take 'military-technical' steps if Helsinki applied for Nato accession. 'The expansion of Nato and the approach of the alliance to our borders does not make the world and our continent more stable and secure,' Peskov said. 'Everything will depend on how this process takes place, how far the military infrastructure moves towards our borders.' Russia's foreign ministry said Moscow would be 'forced to take reciprocal steps ... to address the resulting threats to its national security'. It accused Nato of seeking to create 'another flank for the military threat to our country' and said Helsinki should 'be aware of its responsibility and the consequences of such a move'. The Finnish daily Iltalehti reported that key Finnish politicians had been told Russia could halt gas supplies to Finland on Friday, although it did not say where the warning came from or whether it was in response to the Nato announcement. Finland shares an 810-mile (1,300km) border with Russia and has for decades maintained a strict policy of military non-alignment, viewing membership of the US-led alliance as an unnecessary provocation of Moscow. However, Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February has led to a profound change in its thinking, and looks likely to usher in the very expansion of the western military alliance that the Russian president aimed to prevent. Public support for Nato membership has trebled in Finland, with the latest poll by the public broadcaster Yle showing 76% of Finns in favour compared with about 25% before the invasion, with only 12% against. The president, prime minister and senior cabinet ministers will meet on Sunday to make the formal decision on submitting Finland's membership application. A positive decision would then be presented to parliament for approval early next week. Sweden's ruling Social Democrats are scheduled to decide on Sunday whether to overturn their longstanding opposition to Nato membership, paving the way for a probable application from Stockholm also to join the 30-nation alliance. Sweden's foreign minister, Ann Linde, said Niinisto and Marin's statement was 'an important message', adding that Finland was 'Sweden's closest security and defence partner' and its assessments 'must be taken into account'. Sweden's Expressen daily, citing unnamed sources, said Stockholm's final decision would be made on Monday, with a formal application for membership to be submitted soon afterwards. Nordic media have previously said the two countries were likely to submit a joint application. Nato's secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Finland would be 'warmly welcomed' into the alliance and promised the accession process would be 'smooth and swift', although ratification by all 30 members could take several months. Finland is one of Nato's 'closest partners, a mature democracy, a member of the European Union, and an important contributor to Euro-Atlantic security', Stoltenberg said, adding that Finnish membership would prove that the alliance's 'door is open'. Russia has repeatedly warned Finland and Sweden against joining Nato, saying the 'serious military and political consequences' of such a move would oblige it to 'restore military balance' by strengthening its defences in the Baltic Sea region, including by deploying nuclear weapons. Dmitry Medvedev, the former Russian president, said on Thursday that western countries' 'proxy war with Russia' would 'increase the likelihood of a direct and open conflict between Nato and Russia'. Urging the west not to 'lie to yourself and others' and 'choke in the paroxysms of Russophobia', Medvedev said such a conflict 'always has the risk of turning into a full-fledged nuclear war' and that this would be 'catastrophic for everyone'. Other governments in the region, however, welcomed Helsinki's statement. Denmark's prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said Finnish membership would 'strengthen Nato and our common security'. Copenhagen would do everything for a quick admission process, she said. Germany's chancellor, Olaf Scholz, tweeted his support, saying he had assured Niinisto of 'the full support of the federal government' in a phone call. Estonia's prime minister, Kaja Kallas, said her country supported Finland's rapid accession. Poland's prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said Finland's decision was 'great news for Poland and Europe's security', and the prime minister of the Czech Republic, Petr Fiala, said his country would 'of course' support a Finnish application to join the alliance. Finland's foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, told the European parliament accession to Nato would strengthen security in the region. Norway, Denmark and the three Baltic states were already Nato members and the addition of Finland would 'bring added value', he said. Finland and Sweden are officially non-aligned but became Nato partners - taking part in exercises and exchanging intelligence - after abandoning their strict neutrality when they joined the EU in 1995 after the end of the cold war. Finland declared independence in 1917 after more than a century of Russian rule, and its heavily outnumbered army twice fought off Soviet forces during the second world war before ceding some border territory. Sweden has not fought a war for 200 years. Marin and her Swedish counterpart, Magdalena Andersson, said at a joint press conference last month that Russia's invasion of Ukraine had changed Europe's whole security landscape and 'dramatically shaped mindsets' in the Nordic countries. Nato's common security guarantee rests on article 5, the alliance's cornerstone, which says an attack on one Nato member is an attack on all. It has been invoked only once in the organisation's history, in response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks.", "7a44cb84697c3e641c92431fed7d8122adcc3f56d494e581b58f08e6": "Urgent measures to break the Russian blockade of grain exports from Ukraine's ports, including by trying to open routes through Romanian and Baltic ports, will be discussed by G7 foreign and agriculture ministers at meetings in Germany. The grain exports blockade is fast becoming one of the most urgent diplomatic and humanitarian crises in Ukraine. On Tuesday Joe Biden said the US was working on solutions 'to get this food out into the world so that it could help bring down prices'. G7 foreign ministers are meeting in the Baltic Sea resort of Weissenhaus, north-east of Hamburg, and the agriculture ministers in Stuttgart. Cem Ozdemir, the German agriculture minister and a Green party member, has for months been looking with the EU at alternative train routes through Poland and Belarus to Baltic ports, but the different train gauges between Ukraine and Poland, a pre-existing backlog of traffic and the shortage of suitable rail wagons all count against this option.  By one Ukrainian estimate, only 20% of the exports Ukraine normally sent through the Black Sea ports by ship could ever be transported by rail to the Baltic ports. The cost of road transport has risen fivefold in the past year. Before the war, most of the food produced by Ukraine - enough to feed 400 million people - was exported through the country's seven Black Sea ports. In the eight months before the conflict began, close to 51m metric tonnes of grain passed through them, according to the UN World Food Programme. The trade was worth $47bn (PS38bn) a year to Ukraine. The Ukrainian minister of agricultural policy and food, Mykola Solsky, has studied options ranging from Gdansk or farther east to the port in Klaipeda in Lithuania and three ports in Latvia. The Baltic ports have lost trade from Russia and Belarus, including of potash, and so currently have spare capacity. The Romanian port of Constanta has also taken some shipments of Ukrainian grain, but ships then carrying the grain towards Turkey would probably need to stay within Romanian waters. The UN has also discussed whether a humanitarian corridor could be opened through Belarus to take the grain to the Baltic ports since the track gauge between Ukraine and Belarus is uniform. The UN World Food Programme's David Beasley, who has been sounding the alarm for weeks, said: 'Right now Ukraine's grain silos are full. At the same time, 44 million people around the world are marching towards starvation. We have to open up these ports so that food can move in and out of Ukraine. The world demands it because hundreds of millions of people globally depend on food that comes through these ports.' Typically, Ukraine would export about 5 to 6 million tonnes of grain and 700,000 tonnes of oilseeds through the Black Sea ports a month. There is an estimated backlog for export of anything between 15m and 20m tonnes, according to the Ukrainian Agribusiness Club. Markiyan Dmytrasevych, Ukraine's designated deputy agrarian minister, said exports by rail could be expanded to between 600,000 tonnes and 1m tonnes, but it would take 18 to 24 months to clear the current inventories, and that is before any new crop has been added. In April only 560,000 metric tonnes were exported by rail from Ukraine. Roman Slaston, the director general of the Ukrainian Agribusiness Club, said reopening the ports remained the best option, but exports by road, river barges and rail trucks could be doubled to approximately half what was going through the Ukrainian Black Sea ports. The greatest potential for growth, he said, would come from organising an army of as many as 10,000 trucks transporting grain on a five-day round trip from Ukraine to Baltic ports. He said 40 EU grain terminals could be used by Ukraine. Slaston said as many as 5,000 train wagons loaded with grain at the Polish border were waiting to cross, but currently there was only capacity to bring 350 wagons a day over. After the port city of Odesa was struck by Russian missiles on Monday, Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said: 'Without our agricultural exports, dozens of countries in different parts of the world are already on the brink of food shortages. The poorest will be hit the hardest. The political repercussions of this will be terrible.' David Miliband, the International Rescue Committee chief executive, said: 'At the moment I think it's at least equally likely that the sanctions on Russia get the blame for the rising food prices as does the invasion of Ukraine. There is a huge contest to be won for public opinion globally.' Signs already exist that Russian diplomacy is trying to shift the blame. Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, claimed on a visit to Oman that Ukrainian authorities were refusing to let ships carrying wheat out of their ports and had mined the areas around ports. Ukraine said the accusations were absurd. In 2020 Ukraine was the world's fifth largest exporter of wheat, and low- and middle-income countries were important beneficiaries. The main export destinations were Egypt, Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Lebanon. In Egypt, where a third of the population lives below the official poverty line and relies on state-subsidised bread, flour prices have risen by 15%. General inflation for April was just over 13%. In the month after the conflict started, export prices for wheat and maize rose by 22% and 20% respectively, on top of steep rises in 2021. Solsky said these rises were likely to continue since Ukrainian farmers' sowing campaign has been delayed by as much as a fifth because of a lack of herbicides, colder weather, diesel fuel and the movement of vehicles because of curfews. Farmers have switched from spring crops to sunflower and soya beans. It is estimated that about a fifth of Ukrainian agricultural land is now in Russian hands.", "b267f7695bdd0cd6f486271ae80860f358b34ade74176a2f35776b04": "", "97fd51a1a925c83b7012c4d2190f619a20654d94d4a6236504a42ca1": "A freelance journalist from Spain is spending his 10th week in Polish custody while prosecutors there investigate espionage allegations that appear to be linked to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In a case that raises red flags about press freedom in Europe at a time of war, prosecutors are expected next week to ask a judge for a further three-month extension to the detention of Pablo Gonzalez, who has freelanced for media including Spain's La Sexta TV channel, Spanish state news agency EFE and the US-government funded Voice of America. The prosecutors' request must be filed before 15 May, two weeks before his current three-month detention order expires. Under Polish law, Gonzalez can be held in custody until he is put on trial, a process lawyers say could easily take more than a year. Polish officials claim he is an agent of Russia's infamous GRU military intelligence. 'He carried out operations for the benefit of Russia, profiting from his status of journalist, which enabled him to freely travel around the world and Europe, including military conflict zones,' according to a spokesperson for Poland's minister coordinator of special services. 'Vast evidence has been secured, which now undergoes a detailed analysis,' the spokesperson said, adding that Gonzalez faces 10 years in jail for taking part in 'activities of foreign intelligence services against the Republic of Poland'. Friends and family claim the allegations are absurd and have demanded Gonzalez be tried or freed immediately. 'I have no doubt he is not a spy,' said Juan Teixeira, a Spanish journalist who has travelled with him to many countries over a dozen years. Gonzalez, who was born in Russia and has joint Spanish and Russian nationality, was detained after agents from Poland's internal security agency (ABW) knocked on his hotel door in the border town of Przemysl shortly after midnight on 27 February. He had been covering the refugee crisis and also planned to report from the Ukrainian side of the border. Gonzalez's Polish lawyer, Bartosz Rogala, said he was well and had been visited by the Spanish consul. His wife, Oihana Goiriena, complained that family letters and parcels had been delayed or not handed over. 'They include drawings from his children,' she told the Guardian. Goiriena said her husband made regular visits to see his father in Russia. Gonzalez's two passports give him different names. His Russian passport bears his father's surname Rubtsov and Pavel, the Russian version of Pablo, while his Spanish passport bears his mother's Spanish surname, Gonzalez. Supporters fear this is seen as proof that he was using aliases. That confusion arises because his parents divorced and his mother moved to Spain when Gonzalez was a young boy, registering him under her surname. Gonzalez's maternal grandfather had been one of thousands of Spanish children evacuated to Russia during the Spanish civil war in 1936. Gonzalez speaks Russian, studied Slavic languages at university and specialises in the post-Soviet world, reporting mostly for Spanish outlets - often spending half or more of the year away from the home in Spain's Basque country where his wife and three children live. In 2016, Gonzalez's name appeared on a list reportedly drawn up by academic researchers of 49 Spanish journalists, politicians and activists whose Twitter comments were deemed 'pro-Russian'. 'As someone who works on the ground in the Ukraine ... that is a worry,' he said at the time. He began to have problems reporting early in February, weeks before the invasion on 24 February, when Ukrainian authorities questioned him while he was waiting for a live link with La Sexta with military positions behind him. He was told to report to the Ukrainian intelligence service in Kyiv, where he was advised to leave the country but not formally expelled. Gonzalez sought advice from the Spanish consulate then left for Poland. A few days later, agents from Spain's centre for national intelligence (CNI) visited the family home near the town of Guernica and quizzed his wife. 'There was nothing aggressive about it and they did not come into the house,' she said. 'They suggested that he might be pro-Russian. I don't actually know what that means, after all a Russian national can be both pro-Russian and anti-Putin.' When Gonzalez heard about the visit, he returned to Spain. But when war broke out, he immediately left for Poland. 'He's a journalist. That's how he makes his living,' said Goiriena. Friends said he also believed Ukraine would allow him back. The Paris-based journalists' NGO Reporters without Borders is watching closely. 'The Polish authorities must be more transparent about the evidence they hold against him, because so far information is scarce and detaining a journalist for months without trial is very serious,' a spokesperson said. 'Pablo Gonzalez's fundamental rights need to be respected in Poland, an EU democracy.' Gonzalez spent his 40th birthday in jail last month. Rogala, Gonzalez's lawyer, said he would ask the court to release his client without charges or, at least, free him on bail next week. Hearings will be held behind closed doors.", "060a419688abd946bc924a13b90f6140ac24e46845e53941af798c1c": "The House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol has issued unprecedented subpoenas to five Republican members of Congress, seeking to compel their cooperation with the inquiry into Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. The select committee empowered the chairman, Bennie Thompson, to move ahead with subpoenas to the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, Andy Biggs of Arizona and Mo Brooks of Alabama. The five congressmen flatly refused to accept invitations to provide voluntary assistance to the investigation, sources said. Thompson said: 'Before we hold our hearings next month, we wished to provide members the opportunity to discuss these matters with the committee voluntarily. Regrettably, the individuals receiving subpoenas today have refused and we're forced to take this step to help ensure the committee uncovers facts concerning January 6th.' The subpoena letters indicate that the select committee is seeking testimony from the five House Republicans about some of the most sensitive details about Trump's unlawful efforts to overturn the election, including their contacts with Trump. The Guardian reported earlier this week that the panel was moving closer to issuing subpoenas to Republicans in Congress, appalled at their refusal to assist in any way despite prima facie connections to the events of 6 January. What changed for members of the committee, according to sources familiar with internal deliberations, was that they could no longer ignore what appeared to be deep involvement in Trump's unlawful schemes to overturn the 2020 election results. After the announcement, McCarthy told reporters that 'I have not seen a subpoena' and repeated his previous attacks on the committee. 'They're not conducting a legitimate investigation,' he said. 'Seems as though they just want to go after their political opponents.' Meanwhile, Perry called the investigation a 'charade'. The voluntary cooperation letters outlined in damning detail the reasons that the select committee wanted to depose the five Republicans, as House investigators prepare to wrap up their work ahead of public hearings in June. From McCarthy, the select committee said it wanted to learn more about his communications with Trump before, during and after January 6, including a conversation in which the former president admitted he was partly at fault for the Capitol attack. The panel is keenly interested in what McCarthy believes prompted Trump to make such an admission, the sources said, since it could offer evidence that the former president had a guilty conscience for a possible future justice department criminal investigation. From Biggs, the former chairman of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, the select committee said it wanted to learn more about meetings House Republicans had with Trump at the White House in the days and weeks leading up to January 6. The panel is focusing on a 21 December 2020 meeting that took place in the Oval Office with Trump, the letter indicated, since those attending appeared to strategize ways to unlawfully delay or stop Joe Biden's certification from taking place and return Trump to power. The select committee also wants to depose Jordan to learn more about that meeting with Trump and other communications he had with the former president, his letter said. In the letter to Perry, the select committee said he was directly involved with efforts to corrupt the justice department and install a pro-Trump DoJ official, Jeffrey Clark, as acting attorney general if he opened investigations into baseless claims of election fraud. The panel also subpoenaed Brooks since he spoke at the 'Save America' rally at the Ellipse that preceded the Capitol attack, where he notably wore a bulletproof vest under his shirt, and has spoken publicly about Trump pressuring him to 'rescind' his election loss. One notable and unexplained exception from the list was congressman Ronny Jackson, Trump's former White House doctor, whose name surfaced in text messages among members of the Oath Keepers militia group that stormed the Capitol, some of whom were indicted for seditious conspiracy. Biggs' possible contacts with far-right activist Ali Alexander are of special interest to the investigation, sources said. The committee is trying to untangle claims by Alexander that he 'schemed up putting maximum pressure on Congress while they were voting' with Brooks, Biggs and Paul Gosar, another Arizona Republican, and his testimony that he spoke to Biggs's staff and the congressman himself. Alexander obtained a permit to hold a rally at the Capitol on 6 January but that event never took place. Alexander was instead filmed going up the Capitol steps in a 'stack' formation with members of the Oath Keepers militia. Thompson said the panel wanted to ask Biggs about his efforts to pressure legislators to create 'alternate' slates of electors for Trump in states he lost, as well as an alleged request he made to Trump for a pardon in the days after the Capitol attack.", "355ecfa8b15c91eacd9d4b2c42b99cb11ee157eace05e6f8749e2058": "The government has declined a Commons instruction to release information about the decision to make Evgeny Lebedev a peer, saying this would undermine the confidentiality of those nominated and could degenerate into 'political point-scoring'. Labour called the decision 'a cover-up' and promised more action over what it called a contempt of parliament. The government announcement said information had instead been provided to parliament's intelligence and security committee (ISC). This prompted an immediate rebuff from the ISC, which said its request for details about Lebedev was separate and should have remained classified. In March a humble address motion tabled by Labour was passed by the Commons amid a threatened Tory rebellion, directing ministers to release information about the elevation of the Russian-born businessman and son of a former KGB officer. The vote, in which Tory MPs were instructed to abstain given the extent of backbench Conservative disquiet on the issue, followed revelations that the intelligence services had concerns about a peerage for Lebedev awarded by Boris Johnson, a close friend. But a Cabinet Office document released on Thursday, running to nine pages, contained no new information beyond a handful of redacted emails, including one in which Lebedev confirmed he had completed a form, and another in which an unidentified official congratulated him on the peerage. The only other information was already known, such as a full list of people made political peers in 2020 alongside Lebedev. In a parallel written statement of explanation, the Cabinet Office minister Michael Ellis said that while the government 'is and remains committed to openness and transparency', it would not abide by the Commons request. Ministers had provided a more detailed response to the ISC 'following a separate request from them for information relating to any national security matters arising', he said. In response, the ISC said it was 'surprised' by Ellis linking the two requests in his statement, adding: 'So far as the ISC is concerned, at this stage our request for information should have remained a private - and classified - matter of oversight.' In his statement, Ellis said ministers had to balance openness with 'the wider public interest', and it would not be helpful to publish details about the scrutiny given to prospective peers. 'I can assure parliament that proper consideration would be given to any information which indicated national security concern arising from a prospective appointment before a decision was made,' he wrote. 'It is essential that the confidentiality of these arrangements is maintained as it is this that ensures the vetting procedures are suitably robust and command confidence, whilst also protecting the private and personal data of those individuals who have entered into the vetting process.' In what was almost a veiled warning about the consequences of agreeing to the request, Ellis wrote: 'Honourable members should be conscious that requests for information on the internal correspondence of the [House of Lords appointments] commission could also be applied to such opposition recommendations (including those which are rejected or withdrawn). I do not believe it would be in the public interest for such internal correspondence to be used in the future for political point-scoring.' He ended: 'Lord Lebedev is a man of good standing.' Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said: 'This looks like a cover-up and smells like a cover-up because it is a cover-up. If the prime minister is claiming he was not involved in forcing through the award of a peerage to an individual of concern to our intelligence services, he should come clean and publish the documents as parliament instructed. 'The government is once again seeking to hide in the shadows from the sunlight of scrutiny. We will take steps to rectify this contempt of parliament.' Boris Johnson's deputy spokesperson defended the decision. 'It's our responsibility to protect the integrity of the vetting process which, as you know, is voluntarily entered into on a confidential basis,' they said. 'We are committed to transparency, but the disclosure we have made reflects the need to maintain the integrity of the system.'", "78dedf625ee5536ba35261d9e19f2b0e7a874f8164072e41ed6714ed": "After a month of crippling ransomware attacks, Costa Rica has declared a state of emergency invoking a measure usually reserved to deal with natural disasters or the Covid-19 pandemic to allow the government to react more nimbly to the crisis. President Rodrigo Chaves, who was sworn in on Sunday, made the emergency declaration one of his first acts. It was published on Wednesday, but Chaves has not named the members of the National Emergency Commission. The declaration refers to the attack Costa Rica is suffering at the hands of 'cybercriminals' and 'cyberterrorists'. The Russian-speaking Conti gang had claimed responsibility for the attack. Last week the US state department offered a $10m reward for information leading to the identification or location of Conti leaders. The attack began in April when the finance ministry was the first to report that a number of its systems were affected, including tax collection and customs. Attacks also targeted the social security agency's human resources system and labor ministry. The Costa Rican government has not reported an expansion of the attack, but some systems, especially at the finance ministry, are still not functioning normally. The government has also not made an estimate of the losses caused by the attack. Carlos Alvarado was still president when the attacks began and he said Costa Rica would not pay the gang any ransom. In its statement last week, the US state department said the Conti group had been responsible for hundreds of ransomware incidents during the past two years. 'The FBI estimates that as of January 2022, there had been over 1,000 victims of attacks associated with Conti ransomware with victim payouts exceeding $150,000,000, making the Conti Ransomware variant the costliest strain of ransomware ever documented,' the statement said. In addition to the ransomware state of emergency, Chaves also eliminated pandemic-related obligatory use of masks in public spaces and issued a decree that urged public institutions to not sanction officials who have not been vaccinated against Covid-19, reversing his predecessor's policy.", "e94700b6336593f11b45b32782f7323dc3d862898b3030a3773e5f17": "", "f60d249229991dbb18eecec06407f05ac29935b6602ae22bd6ad626b": "", "3ef73963cc5c910272055fa814d1dc78173efa52fdff63e6418fffa4": "", "dcd9c9587927593b348966017a19ea1300009ddf684b185d10bb8b34": "How do you become the richest man in the world? In Elon Musk's case, part of it involves making workers in China put in hours that would be unacceptable according to labor norms elsewhere. On Tuesday, the Tesla boss praised Chinese factory workers for pulling extreme hours while taking a shot at American workers. 'There is just a lot of super talented hardworking people in China who strongly believe in manufacturing,' the billionaire said. 'They won't just be burning the midnight oil, they will be burning the 3am oil, they won't even leave the factory type of thing, whereas in America people are trying to avoid going to work at all.' Musk's comment comes as Tesla's massive Shanghai 'Giga-factory' pushes its workers to the limit to meet production targets amid an ongoing pandemic lockdown. In April, Tesla restricted its Shanghai workers from leaving the factory under a so-called 'closed-loop' system originally developed by Chinese authorities to contain Beijing Olympics participants. While locked inside, the workers were reportedly made to work 12-hour shifts, six days in a row, and to sleep on factory floors. Production at the plant was forced to halt this week due to parts shortages, the company said. Labor rights and safety violations have been reported at Tesla's Shanghai factory since it opened in 2018, with some workers making as little as $1,500 a month in what an investigation by local journalists called the 'Giga-sweatshop.' Even in the United States, Musk is well known for his disregard for labor norms and work-life balance: the tech billionaire infamously declared 'nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week'. He has bragged about making Tesla's US employees work 100-hour weeks, while claiming to have worked 120-hour weeks himself. In March, Musk called an all-hands meeting for his other company, SpaceX, at 1am. These practices are on par with China's extreme work culture, nicknamed '996', in which workers are expected to work from 9am to 9pm, six days a week. The practice has been the source of protests in recent years and has been characterized as a form of modern slavery. Eli Friedman, a China labor expert and associate professor of international and comparative labor at Cornell University's ILR School, said Musk's remark should be understood in the 'broader context of American corporations taking advantage not just of the low cost of labor in China, but the flexibility'. For bosses like Musk, 'that's the comparative advantage: the fact that you have hundreds of thousands of workers that you can literally wake up in the middle of the night and put them on the production line,' Friedman said. 'It's tapping into a kind of Orientalist narrative about these kind of robotic Chinese workers who, [Musk] says in a sort of valorized way, that this is a good thing,' the researcher added. Officially, Chinese labor law mandates a 40-hour work week, with employees allowed up to 36 hours of overtime a month - which would come out to just over a 48-hour work week. But that's not what happens in practice. 'There's no pretence anywhere that that's enforced,' said Friedman. 'Excessive overtime is kind of a built-in feature of the whole model of industrial development in China. Very long hours and compulsory overtime, while not legal, are also completely the norm. And this is done regularly in consultation with local governments who are also tasked with enforcing the labor law.' Employees in China are often asked to sign a 'striver's pledge' which waives their right to overtime pay and paid time off. And while many corporations in China have unions, the unions are funded by the employer, which makes them essentially powerless to negotiate against management, Friedman noted. Tesla did not respond to questions about its factory's work hours and policies. China's gruelling culture of extreme hours has been celebrated by tech billionaires in the country, including Alibaba's Jack Ma, who has called the '996' system a 'huge blessing', and rival company JD.com's Richard Liu, who has called workers who work fewer hours 'slackers'. In recent years, a growing movement of Chinese workers has stood up to oppose overwork, with some activists using tools like GitHub to compile lists of Chinese companies accused of violating labor laws. Anger over the country's extreme work culture intensified last January after a 22-year-old worker for Shanghai-based e-commerce firm Pinduoduo collapsed and died after leaving work at 1.30am, after a run of brutally long shifts. Incidents like these helped drive a trend among young Chinese social media users early last year promoting 'tang ping', or 'lying flat' as a passive protest against work, which has since been restricted on the Chinese internet. Later in the year, China's top court ruled that forced and excessive overtime was illegal, but the ruling has not been well enforced. Work stoppages, often unofficial 'wildcat' strikes, continue to occur regularly in China. Chinese and American labor norms have clashed in recent years, as bosses pit teams against each other. The 2019 Netflix documentary 'American Factory' described the conflicts that arose after a Chinese billionaire, Cao Dewang, opened a factory in an abandoned General Motors plant in Ohio. 'American workers are not efficient, and output is low,' Cao complained at one point in the film. 'I can't manage them.' Last week, the Wall Street Journal revealed that some of the US-based employees at Chinese-owned TikTok were expected to pull back-to-back all-nighters and spend as many as 85 hours a week in meetings to keep up with their Chinese colleagues. In the United States, employees covered by the federal Fair Labor Standards Act must receive overtime pay for working more than 40 hours a week. But the law places no cap on the number of hours an employee can work. The grim backdrop to Musk's comments is that 'American workers are in a very subjugated position as well, unfortunately', said Friedman. 'The not-at-all subtle threat is that these Chinese workers are a threat to you white American workers. If you don't meet that standard, then your jobs are on the line.'", "81d82bd61f9617f798e864cbff4cbc800bc00516950b9b6267893850": "", "abb40171078a3dad4e95b3c4f417e7daf3e9aa2c80f3b289202f025d": "", "77a6c4f52f42d6c093b347c4207d39b2cb3d3cad122d761c30fa2e30": "", "8a6dbd7204b8401b6ae7c902b29ede3467532d836244d93b206bbf3d": "", "5db1afd1a13a90405550ca20e453a45dfc64774a63421f472c5b9db0": "", "ebe67b7596e17ae07977ff71ca8fca8be410bac6fb52e922da542269": "", "aac678e2067f51aeb50e9a7ba748a4d4bfc1b7d4570f4a12a1058459": "", "d65481d8586c0d0d75efcbbba06be79b1adb2e5013686f33ab8683a7": "", "bc93b568223be683515fef8895bad47f3292885e92b2c4cad35f5849": "", "c1504404bab7284cbcaf40677015c97953c094f2e002670ee1651b11": "", "835772f165cff0d5a5ffa116614e6276d4ff4b4ac52ba28d1a661e3b": "Sri Lanka's beleaguered president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, has sworn in a new prime minister to replace his brother as the country reels from days of violence.

'He is being sworn in as prime minister ... because a number of members of parliament have asked him to take over and solve the country's problems,' Abeywardena said. Mahinda Rajakapsa, the president's brother, reluctantly resigned as prime minister on Monday after violent attacks by the family's supporters on peaceful anti-government protesters. Protesters have blamed the president for devastating economic mismanagement and corruption that have pushed Sri Lanka to the brink of bankruptcy, and repeatedly called on him to quit. It is unclear whether Wickremesinghe's appointment will be enough to placate them. Monday's attacks by pro-government supporters of the Rajapaksas on a peaceful protest camp in Colombo led to several days of violence in which at least nine people were killed and more than 200 injured. Dozens of residences owned by the Rajapaksas and their loyalists were set on fire. The army was deployed across Colombo, police were given orders to shoot looters on sight, and a nationwide curfew was in place until Thursday morning. Mahinda Rajapaksa's resignation meant the government and cabinet was dissolved, leaving a power vacuum. The main opposition SJB party was initially invited to lead a new government, but its leader, Sajith Premadasa, insisted the president step down first. Wickremsinghe is seen as a pro-west free-market reformist, potentially making bailout negotiations with the International Monetary Fund and others smoother. He has criticised decision-making by the Rajapaksas, particularly its refusal to go to the IMF, and was among those who called for Mahinda Rajapaksa to step down after Monday's violence. Some see Wickremesinghe as a safe pair of hands to run an interim government, but others questioned his appointment given that his party has only one seat in parliament and said citizens wanted sweeping reforms. Opposition politicians Anura Dissananayake said the choice of Wickremesinghe was more about protecting the president and his family from public anger over his role in the economic crisis than solving the country's problems. Members of Sri Lanka's influential Buddhist clergy have already signalled their dissatisfaction with the appointment of the veteran politician. 'What we asked for is a new government that will include fresh blood, not those whose who have already been rejected by the people,' said leading monk Omale Sobitha. In an interview with the Guardian in April, Wickremesinghe denied he had any intention of joining the government, despite reports he was working with the Rajapaksas behind the scenes. 'No, no, I'm only getting involved in the sense of helping to resolve some of the economic issues from the outside, I'm not joining the government as a minister or anything,' he said. 'That leaves me free. I have no interest except to make sure people are fed and parliament takes control of the situation.' Amid fears that members of the ruling elite might try to flee the country, the courts imposed an overseas travel ban on Thursday on 17 leaders of the governing Sri Lanka People's Front (SLPP), including Mahinda Rajapaksa and his son Namal.", "d60ba727139123cbfcd93aea233f197bbc358d300f70a77e2539b95a": "All 4,000 inhabitants of a small town in Canada's Northwest Territories have been ordered to evacuate as parts of the country struggle with some of the worst flooding in decades. Chief April Martel of the Katl'odeeche First Nation ordered her entire community to leave Hay River after breakaway ice sent floodwaters surging into the centre of the town on Wednesday. The local department of infrastructure had declared the only road link to the town's airport impassable, closing it off. A section of ice broke away on Wednesday, sending a fresh surge which covered downtown Hay River in a foot or more of water within minutes. Some residents reported being rescued from their homes by boat. The town sits at the mouth of the Hay River, where it flows into the Great Slave Lake on a miniature delta through which several river channels run. Ice jamming those channels had blocked water and a weekend of rain and snow in the river's basin added more more and more water into that system. 'There was a large volume of ice, a large volume of snow in the basin over winter, and then this storm hit - initially as rain, which then flowed directly into streams and creeks, bumping up the water level immediately - and it parked over the entire basin,' territorial hydrologist Shawne Kokelj said this week. 'Now what we're seeing is there's still high water coming from farther upstream because a lot of rain fell there, too, and now some of the snow is melting and so keeps feeding a lot of these smaller streams. Justin Gaudet of the Paddle Prairie Mtis Settlement, where about 800 people live said a local emergency alert was issued Sunday after rain and snowmelt raised water levels on six nearby rivers to heights that elders in the community last saw more than 50 years ago. 'Some of these homes don't have running water right now,' Gaudet said late Wednesday. 'The members are very tired, very stressed, very anxious,' he said. Gaudet said the water level had lowered, but moisture and contaminated water pose the threat of mold damage, and he said some bridges are also damaged. 'A lot of our homes in the hamlet area sit on wood foundations and are nearly 40 to 50 years old,' he said. 'Without the bridges, people can't leave their homes.' The Dene Tha' First Nation at Chateh, about 845km north-west (525 miles) of Edmonton, and the Little Red River Cree have also been under local emergency alerts due to flooding since the weekend. The mayor of High Level said Tuesday that some evacuees living in the town's arena and hotels were running out of food. 'It's a huge influx of people for our small community,' said Crystal McAteer.", "06a656b003372de089bb9785ed6bd4fa03950656f03d613a616d42f4": "Israel has approved 2,700 housing units in illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank, and advanced plans for another 1,600, a military body has said, a move likely to displease Washington before an expected visit to the region next month by the US president, Joe Biden. An Israeli Civil Administration subcommittee meeting on Thursday approved the building plans and retroactively 'legalised' two outposts in Area C, the 60% of the West Bank under full Israeli control. The news came a day after the Israeli military demolished Palestinian homes in an area where about 1,000 people face the threat of eviction to make way for a military training zone. Since the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, approximately 600,000 to 750,000 Jewish settlers have moved to live on land in occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank. The practice is considered by most of the international community to be illegal, and a major impediment to achieving lasting peace. Under Israeli law, outposts are defined as settlements built without authorisation from the Israeli government. Settler communities are granted permission to build permanent structures connected to the electrical grid and water supply, while building permits for Palestinians living alongside them are almost always denied. Many Palestinians live under the constant threat of eviction, and face a rising tide of settler violence designed to displace them from their homes. Thursday's batch of approvals is the biggest advancement of settlement plans since Biden took office. During Donald Trump's administration, there was a 150% growth in settlement compared with during Barack Obama's second term. Biden's White House, however, is opposed to settlements, which it says undercut the viability of a two-state solution. Israeli officials have denied local media reports that Washington had conditioned the US president's June visit on there being no new announcements of settlement construction. There was no immediate comment from the Palestinians or the US on the settlement approvals. They came on the heels of Wednesday's demolition of Palestinian homes and structures in Masafer Yatta, a cluster of villages in an area south of Hebron that Israel has designated as a military training zone. After a two-decade legal dispute, Israel's high court said last week that about 1,000 Palestinians in Masafer Yatta could be evicted. The ruling is one of the single biggest expulsion decisions since the occupation began. Israel's ideologically diverse government, which was sworn in last June, encompasses leftists who oppose settlement building; rightwingers, such as the prime minister, Naftali Bennett, who previously led a settler lobbying group; and, for the first time, members of an Arab party. Initially united by their desire to remove from office the longtime former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and end four years of political turmoil, an agreement to focus on areas of common ground in governance has faltered when it comes to the occupation. The opening of the Knesset's summer session this week was hit by immediate turbulence. The ruling coalition recently lost its already narrow majority, while a wave of violence - much of it focused on Jerusalem's sensitive al-Aqsa compound - led the United Arab List, or Ra'am, faction to suspend its cooperation. The Ra'am leader, Mansour Abbas, said on Wednesday that his party had for now decided to continue its partnership with the government for the benefit of Israel's Palestinian minority of 2 million people, thwarting opposition initiatives this week to pass no-confidence votes in the Knesset.", "8efe473140140d55ad1c2b3030e55c08b1f09cd0b76ae5bf1d59145e": "", "98b0b3d0e7effb3600a715d7017eeb03c30f1ed188d7ec0cb5acbc7b": "Critics have accused the European Commission of seeking to end encrypted communications after the EU's executive body unveiled strict regulations for messaging apps intended to fight the spread of child sexual abuse imagery. Under the proposed regulations, messaging services and web hosts would be required to search for, and report, child abuse material - even in the case of encrypted messaging services like Apple's iMessage and Facebook's WhatsApp that cannot be scanned in such a way.  'Detection, reporting and removal of child sexual abuse online is urgently needed to prevent the sharing of images and videos of the sexual abuse of children, which retraumatises the victims often years after the sexual abuse has ended,' said Ylva Johansson, the EU's commissioner for home affairs on Thursday. 'Today's proposal sets clear obligations for companies to detect and report the abuse of children, with strong safeguards guaranteeing privacy of all, including children,' she added. Andy Burrows, head of child safety online at the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), welcomed the proposals, which he described as an 'impressively bold and ambitious' attempt to 'systemically prevent avoidable child abuse and grooming, which is taking place at record levels'. He added: 'If approved, it will place a clear requirement on platforms to combat abuse wherever it takes place, including in private messaging where children are at greatest risk.' But the plans have also been criticised as an attack on privacy. 'Private companies would be tasked not just with finding and stopping distribution of known child abuse images, but could also be required to take action to prevent 'grooming' or suspected future child abuse,' said Joe Mullin of Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a privacy group. 'This would be a massive new surveillance system, because it would require the infrastructure for detailed analysis of user messages.' The regulation does not technically require providers to turn off end-to-end encryption entirely. Instead, it allows providers to apply automated techniques to scan for abusive material on users' devices - a compromise that supporters say preserves privacy while also helping deter child abuse. It is a similar approach to that proposed - but indefinitely postponed - by Apple, when the company suggested scanning photos before they were uploaded to its cloud storage. Apple's approach, however, only scanned photos looking for examples of existing child abuse imagery. The commission's proposal includes a requirement to detect newly created images, and even to look for active grooming, which is far harder to successfully achieve with existing automated systems without compromising privacy. It also suggests that app stores, like those run by Apple and Google, should be involved in enforcing the requirements, pulling apps that don't comply with the scanning obligations. Patrick   Breyer, German MEP for the   Pirate   party, called the proposals 'fundamental   rights   terrorism   against   trust,   self-determination   and   security   on   the  iInternet'. He added: 'The   proposed   chat   control   threatens   to   destroy   digital   privacy   of   correspondence   and   secure  encryption. ' Scanning   personal   cloud   storage   would   result   in   the   mass   surveillance   of   private   photos. Mandatory   age   verification   would   end   anonymous   communication.' The   proposal   does   not   include   the   overdue   obligation   on   law   enforcement   agencies   to   report   and   remove   known   abusive   material   on   the   net,   nor   does   it   provide   for   Europe-wide   standards   for   effective   prevention   measures,   victim   support   and   counselling   and   effective   criminal   investigations.  'This   Big   Brother   attack   on   our   mobile   phones,   private   messages   and   photos   with   the   help   of   error-prone   algorithms   is   a   giant   step   towards   a   Chinese-style   surveillance   state,' Breyer said.", "631018ceaacdb9f2724b94188b81500008d55ecc7cce10aa19fbfbd5": "Granting Levi Bellfield's request to get married in prison is 'inconceivable' unless serious safeguarding concerns are addressed, Dominic Raab has said. Bellfield, who murdered Marsha McDonnell, Amelie Delagrange and Milly Dowler, is engaged and has requested a prison wedding, the Ministry of Justice has confirmed. It is understood that his application is being processed. He would need the permission of the prison governor to marry at HMP Frankland in Durham. The justice secretary said on Thursday that a prison wedding was unlikely because the 53-year-old posed a risk to his fiancee. When asked what powers he had to stop the wedding, Raab - who is also deputy prime minister - criticised the Human Rights Act. 'The Human Rights Act puts all sorts of obstacles in our way in that regard, which is I think one more reason why we are introducing a bill of rights to add a bit more common sense,' he said. 'What I can tell you is it is inconceivable that the prison or the Ministry of Justice would authorise that marriage unless the very significant concerns about the safeguarding were addressed. We've asked for a risk assessment in relation to that. Clearly, we're dealing with a dangerous serial killer.' Raab said it was very difficult to see how the safeguarding concerns could be overcome. The prisons minister, Victoria Atkins, had earlier ordered an immediate review into Bellfield's request, describing it as 'absolutely appalling'. She told Sky News: 'I just want to reassure people, I understand an application has been made that has not been decided yet, and he most certainly has not yet married, but, if I may, he's currently got the right under article 12 of the Human Rights Act to get married ... or they have the right to have the application to be considered by prison governors. '[It's] absolutely appalling. I've ordered an immediate review into this. I very much welcome the debate we're about to have about the bill of rights and looking at human rights for the United Kingdom for the 21st century. Believe me, I'll be raising this.' News of the story, which first appeared in the Sun, said Bellfield proposed to his fiancee in front of prison staff. Speaking to the newspaper, the former justice secretary Robert Buckland said: 'Milly never got to see her wedding day. It cannot be right that he gets to have his. People will be rightly shocked to hear that a man capable of such depraved crimes and is rightly imprisoned is able to form a relationship of this kind.' Bellfield was given a whole-life term for murdering McDonnell, 19, in 2003, and for murdering Delagrange, 22, and attempting to murder Kate Sheedy, 18, in 2004. He was already serving this sentence when he went on trial for killing Milly, who was abducted while walking from school to her home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in March 2002. Bellfield was found guilty of abducting and killing the 13-year-old after a trial at the Old Bailey in 2011.", "f95d6378479492c584a9247d9a40c549a2a0fd048b57516e86afdb32": "Workers took Donald Trump's name off his hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington DC on Wednesday, after the completion of the $375m sale of the lease to investors from Florida. House Democrats estimate the former president, under legal and financial pressure on multiple fronts, will reportedly gain $100m from the sale, once a loan for the renovations is paid off. One ethics group called the hotel 'a sinkhole of corruption'. During Trump's four years in the White House, the hotel became a magnet for aides, supporters and foreign businesses seeking favour. Critics and ethics groups were particularly concerned about the situation as Trump did not formally divest himself from the Trump Organization. The presidential historian Michael Beschloss predicted that even after the sale 'political ghosts will linger'. The hotel lost more than $70m in the four years of Trump's presidency, including losses each year before pandemic shutdowns in 2020. Many hotel brokers, owners and consultants did not expect the 263-room hotel, located close to the White House, to fetch such a high price. The price of the lease, equivalent to more than $1.4m a room, has drawn scrutiny from Democrats in Congress. The New York Times reported that JLL, a real estate firm, put the average sales price for hotels in Washington in 2020 at $354,000 per room. CGI Merchant Group, the buyer, reportedly plans to turn the hotel into a branch of the Waldorf Astoria hotel chain. Earlier this month, the House oversight committee requested documents from CGI, listing all investors, which reportedly include the former New York Yankees slugger and confessed drugs cheat Alex Rodriguez. The sale marks the end of a controversial chapter in Trump's rise. The real estate magnate opened the Trump International Hotel in the Old Post Office building in 2016, during his run for the presidency. In a statement on Wednesday, Eric Trump, Trump's second son, said: 'We took a dilapidated and underutilised building and transformed it into one of the most iconic hotels in the world.' The hotel had long attracted criticism for perceived conflicts of interest. Recently, the Trump Organization and Trump's 2017 presidential inaugural committee agreed to pay $750,000 to settle a suit brought by the District of Columbia attorney general that claimed the hotel received excessive payments from the committee. On news of the settlement, Carolyn Maloney, the Democratic chair of the House oversight committee, said her concerns about the sale of the lease 'had only increased'. The building is still owned by the federal government, which approved the sale of the lease in March. When Trump was in power, claims or lawsuits under the emoluments clause of the constitution, which covers gifts and payments to office holders, could not stick. In 2019, Kathleen Clark, Washington University Law professor, told the Guardian: 'For over a hundred years, the justice department has strictly interpreted the constitution's anti-corruption emoluments clause to prohibit federal officials from accepting anything of value from foreign governments, absent congressional consent. 'In 2017, the department reversed course, adopting arguments nearly identical to those put forward by Trump's private sector lawyers. Instead of defending the republic against foreign influence, the department ... defend[ed] Trump's ability to receive money from foreign governments.' On Wednesday, the advocacy group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or Crew, said: 'The Trump Hotel in DC is no more. Good riddance to a sinkhole of corruption.' But it also said: 'We still have some questions ... namely, whether a 'premium sale price' for a hotel that has been losing money is justified and what are the outstanding security risks to the hotel.' Mark S Zaid, an attorney in Washington who specialises in cases involving the federal government, added: 'I still count this as vindication for our legal efforts to remove Trump from this majestic building. We started an effort that contributed. It took longer than it should have.'", "e33a6462b913ef13c8895dd2bda27f14b79ab93cdc7ca767305978f7": "Twitter announced the departure of two top leaders in a major shakeup that comes as billionaire Elon Musk is working to close a $44bn deal to acquire the company. In an email to employees on Thursday, chief executive Parag Agrawal said Twitter's leaders for consumer product and revenue will leave the company. Agrawal said the company was temporarily pausing hiring, and would review all existing job offers to determine whether any 'should be pulled back'. Agrawal said Twitter was not able to hit user growth and revenue milestones to maintain confidence that it could reach aggressive growth targets it had set in 2020. 'We need to continue to be intentional about our teams, hiring and costs,' Agrawal wrote. Catherine Hill, a spokeswoman from Twitter confirmed by email the two employees would be leaving the company. 'We are pulling back on non-labor costs to ensure we are being responsible and efficient,' she added. 'Effective this week, we are pausing most hiring and backfills, except for business critical roles.'  Among the departures are the social media platform's head of consumer product, Kayvon Beykpour, and head of revenue, Bruce Falck. Both executives confirmed their exits on Thursday morning on Twitter. Beykpour said he was informed he would be terminated while on paternity leave. 'The truth is that this isn't how and when I imagined leaving Twitter, and this wasn't my decision,' he said in a tweet. 'Parag asked me to leave after letting me know that he wants to take the team in a different direction.' Falck was also fired, according to a tweet that has since been deleted. His Twitter bio now says 'unemployed'. Agrawal had installed both the executives in those roles in a reorganization of the company when he took over as chief executive officer in December, after founder Jack Dorsey stepped down from the role. The departures come as the tech industry grapples with a slowdown following explosive growth amid the pandemic, which sent many workplaces online. Facebook parent company Meta also is 'slowing growth' in hiring, it confirmed Wednesday, after difficult earnings reports in recent quarters. Musk's decision to buy Twitter has raised concerns with investors and employees over the future of the company. Twitter shares fell to $46 on Thursday, well below the purchase price Musk agreed to of $54.20. On his personal account, where he has 92.5 million followers, Musk has mused about creating a subscription model for the social media platform, verifying all users, and returning the homepage to a chronological timeline from its current algorithmic feed. Twitter's reorganization could also create some financial cushion should Musk choose to back out of the deal, which will take months to finalize. The executive could still walk away from the purchase, though he would be required to pay a $1bn fee to do so. Musk is worth more than $220bn.", "530a847ed5b1d3ab05b48db2a0e45545ea2a0d8240dc72312c2f9edc": "The Nobel prize-winning author Mario Vargas Llosa, Latin America's most eminent living chronicler of power and corruption, has declared a preference for Jair Bolsonaro over Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva as Brazil prepares to head to the polls later this year. The 86-year-old Peruvian writer, who also holds Spanish citizenship, revealed his thoughts on October's election during a talk in Uruguay on Wednesday. 'The Bolsonaro case is a very difficult one,' he told an audience in Montevideo. 'Bolsonaro's clowning around is very difficult for a liberal to accept. But now, between Bolsonaro and Lula, I of course prefer Bolsonaro. Even with Bolsonaro's foolishness, he's not Lula.' The writer, who was beaten to the Peruvian presidency in 1990 by Alberto Fujimori, said Lula was regarded fondly in Europe despite having been convicted 'of being a thief'. The controversial corruption charges to which Vargas Llosa referred were annulled last year. His support for Bolsonaro, however, was far from uncritical when it came to the president's attacks on Covid vaccines. 'It's insane, it's absurd to oppose [them] in the way he has,' Vargas Llosa said. 'It seems absolutely irresponsible to me.' It is not the first time the novelist has thrown his weight behind a rightwing candidate. A few months before the second round of last year's presidential election in Peru, Vargas Llosa set aside decades of lacerating criticism of the Fujimori political dynasty when he called on voters to support his former foe's daughter Keiko rather than her far-left opponent, Pedro Castillo, who nonetheless prevailed. 'Peruvians should vote for Keiko Fujimori because she represents the lesser of two evils, and if she's in power there are more possibilities of saving our democracy,' he wrote in his column in Spain's El Pais. In 2009 Alberto Fujimori - whose time as president was marked by Shining Path terrorism, economic upheaval and political corruption - was given a 25-year prison sentence for authorising death squads and presiding over rampant graft and vote-rigging. When neighbouring Chile voted in its final-round presidential election last December, Vargas Llosa backed the ultra-conservative Jose Antonio Kast over the leftwing Gabriel Boric, the eventual winner. The political scientist Daniel V Guisado noted that the novelist had also supported unsuccessful candidates in Spain, Argentina and Bolivia in recent years. 'Getting Vargas Llosa's backing is the biggest political tombstone of the last century,' Guisado tweeted, adding: 'Congratulations to Lula.' Progressive Brazilians took the comments as further proof that the author of The Time of the Hero and The Feast of the Goat had lost the plot. 'What a sad figure,' tweeted the political economist Filipe Campante. 'He has lost all political lucidity,' agreed Lucas Paulino, a centrist anti-Bolsonaro campaigner from the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte. The Brazilian writer Sergio Rodrigues said the writer's record on backing failed candidates made him 'Don Vargas Loser'. Vargas Llosa, who has drifted further to the right with age, caused a stir in October last year when he said voting the right way in elections was more important than having free elections. 'Latin America will undoubtedly emerge from [a very difficult situation] when Latin Americans discover that they've voted badly,' he told the national convention of Spain's conservative People's party. 'The important thing in elections isn't that there's freedom in those elections; it's voting well - and voting well is something that's very important because countries that vote badly, as has happened in some Latin American countries, pay dearly for it.'", "562427b1b706d83e8c5e19fa5541a01ac4e69871c0cd8eb5ad87cd5e": "", "4b25feb3ad01f2ddebc5967d52b924f079899cc3bbf5cf870e3e0852": "", "54d3fe6fd559c699ca64efbbcd1c2764905ba66a6527ba05a0357935": "", "bb989baf7c22f0b7db93d2443fb87839ec1b4e8c34d812f2b3a89e4c": "", "1c2a89440cfa8225572c06d223c1af64044bf4dcbe93bb8e4f0366f8": "", "13c00e4f8d53dd5dc2786ec9b621918b24ac4d1786f35c7722f92b1d": "Hello Fight to Vote readers, Every Tuesday night for the last year or so, Crystal Mason has had trouble sleeping. On Wednesday mornings, the Texas court of criminal appeals, the state's highest criminal court, usually issues its ruling. And since March of last year, Mason has been waiting for a ruling from the court that could change her life. She's been appealing a five-year prison sentence for voting a provisional ballot in 2016. Mason was ineligible to vote at the time because she was on federal supervised release - which is like probation - for a tax felony. Texas prohibits anyone from voting while they are serving a criminal sentence, but she says - and probation officials have confirmed - that no one told her she was ineligible. Yesterday, Mason, who is 47-years-old and raised seven kids and has six grandchildren, got the phone call she's been anxiously waiting for. In an 8-1 ruling, the court told a lower court it had to reconsider the case to determine whether Mason actually knew she was ineligible to vote when she cast a ballot. It was a partial, but far from final, victory for Mason. I've been following Mason's case for the last few years, and on Wednesday, I spoke with Mason hours after the ruling. We talked about about her case and why she thinks it's struck a nerve across the US. How are you feeling, and what was it like to get the news this morning? I was at work and Kim [Mason's lawyer] called me ... She said the decision came in. I just started to panic, I started to sweat, like nervous, like, 'What's going on, Kim?' She let me know that it's going back to the second court of appeals and they have to prove intent. Like where I really knew that I was committing a crime. And I feel like that's a good step. That's a good step right there. If you go off facts and facts alone, Sam, you know that the supervised release officer testified on the stand and said no one told me [I couldn't vote] in the supervised release office. Then I received paperwork in my judgment and commitment, and in black and white, it's not there. And then you can see it in my supervised release information, it was not there. I think that the criminal court of appeals asked them something very important. That needs to be ... that's the whole case, right there. I'm very happy that they did that. But I know this is not over. You were never told, never had any idea, being on federal supervised release, that you couldn't vote in Texas? Absolutely not. I was never told that. I never had any paperwork stating that. I was going by all my conditions of being on supervised release, and I did not see that at all. I do know that as a felon you still have the right to vote. I had no idea that being on supervised release took that right away from me. There's no way ... I'm on track. I got a good job. I'm making decent money. I'm in school. I'm back with my family, my kids, my grandbabies. You wouldn't have ever taken a chance, if there was even a grey line, of me thinking that I was ineligible to vote. I just wouldn't have did that. You just don't. This has been a disaster for me. The jobs that I have lost. Me going back to prison [Mason was ordered to return to federal prison for 10 months for being convicted of a crime while on supervised release], leaving my kids. Me fighting to try to maintain everything. It's been a disaster for me. There have been very significant consequences for you and your family. Can you walk me through what some of those consequences have been? I had to go back to prison. I had three jobs taken away from me. I fought to maintain my house and everything. And I am the provider for my family. You were not a political person in 2016. Not at all. And since then you've become political. Can you tell me a little bit about what you've been doing and what made you get more politically active? If you go back to my first interviews, you'll hear me say 'I'll never vote again. I'll never vote again.' And that was it. And I realized that's exactly what they wanted me to do. That's exactly what they wanted me to say. I realized that no, I have to let everybody know that what I had done was an innocent mistake. And I am being prosecuted for an innocent mistake and that is not right. And then I had to let everybody know how important it is to go vote. Because the people that did this to me - the judge, the DA, the prosecutor - they're all elected officials. So this is the reason why it's so important that we get out and vote. And what has your group, Crystal Mason 'The Fight', been focused on? Has it been teaching people about their rights eligibility? Encouraging them to vote? All of the above? All of the above. Educating them on the different types of ballot. We're getting ready to do a town hall. And that's where we're asking different candidates running for different positions to come to my venue and speak to the community. And let us know: who you are and what do you plan on doing if you get the seat you're running for. I've traveled across the country, and almost everywhere I go, people have heard of that woman in Texas who was sentenced to five years in prison for trying to vote. I'm curious why you think your case has resonated so much and caused so much outrage? I think the people see the wrongness. The people that's in the court system, the people that's in a position to do something about it has turned a blind eye on it. I feel that people who hear the story and just really see, they know that I did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. Nothing at all. I filled out a provisional ballot. I'm being sentenced for illegally voting and I never voted. I mean that's wrong right there. There are some people who have said your case is an example of intimidation. Sending a message to Black people, and people who have felony convictions in their past, that you better be really sure you can vote before you try. Do you see it as intimidation? Have you heard from other people who are not going to vote because they heard about what's happened to you? I have heard that. That's because people are scared. They're listening to me, and I tell them 'yep, I'm right here but I'm fighting and it's very wrong.' But people don't want to take a chance. And yes, I do feel like my case is sending a message to the Black and the brown [people]: 'If you dare come to the polls, this could happen to you'. So yes, I do feel like it's sending a message. It is a scare tactic. And that's not right, that's not right at all. So that's the reason I'm out here speaking to people and telling people how important it is to vote. And actually you voted in the primary, a couple months ago [Mason's supervised release expired last year, allowing her to vote in Texas]. What was that like for you to go back to the voting booth and cast a ballot when you were eligible? It was very exciting. I was with my family, and the things that I didn't know [before], I knew. So once I finished up with my ballot, I automatically went to go help my mother. And of course I got stopped and they said, 'Oh no, you can't.' I told her ... I can help her. I had to fill out a form, and they notarized it and everything. I turned around and I went to help my mom and I helped my niece. So I felt real good about being knowledgable about being able to help them through that ballot. Is there anything you hope people take away from your case? What do you hope people will learn from your case and take away from it. The importance of voting. Everybody that has something to do with my case are elected officials.", "1fb101e274119464af40c4fc66276b755bbfc65e9a66853b247234d8": "With hindsight, the environmental activist Helen Steel, a key figure in the 1990s McLibel case, can see that her life with John Dines was suspiciously idyllic.  When they met, at a London Greenpeace meeting in the late 1980s, she was spending her free time protesting against nuclear weapons at Greenham Common, or staying in mining villages supporting striking miners. Soon he was enthusiastically joining her on hunt saboteur trips to disrupt grouse shoots in Yorkshire, or on demonstrations against the poll tax, and spending his weekends with her, helping to campaign against the environmental record of McDonald's. It was only decades after their relationship ended that she began to understand that they got on so well because Dines was using a battery of grooming techniques perfected by colleagues in an undercover police division. The undercover officers in Dines's unit presented themselves as vulnerable and alone in the world; often they would say they were recently bereaved or estranged from their families, preying on the women's good nature, inviting their sympathy and love. The first time Steel went to the pub with Dines, he said his father had died very suddenly. A few months later, he told her his mother had also died unexpectedly; he said he was short of money, so she lent him the funds to fly to New Zealand for the funeral. She began to feel sorry for him and somehow these feelings evolved into a more complicated sense of attachment. Steel was just 23 when they met and was initially surprised that a man five years older than her should be so interested, but they seemed to have a lot in common, particularly their politics, so when he asked her out, eventually she agreed. They found a flat in London and moved in together. They had wonderful holidays in the Outer Hebrides and at Camber Sands. All the while he was telling her he wanted to buy a small house in the countryside with his inheritance, somewhere he could dig a duck pond for her and they could settle down and have six children. 'We got on so well, sharing many of the same interests and never having arguments ... Life with John was idyllic,' she writes in Deep Deception, an extraordinary account of how undercover officers from the Metropolitan police's special demonstration squad (SDS) deceived dozens of women into fake relationships, co-written with four other women who were similarly ensnared. 'All of us began by thinking that the men had in some way genuinely cared about us - even after we discovered that they were undercover officers,' she says now, describing how her anger mounted steadily as she researched and wrote the book. 'As we talked through what happened to us, we saw so many patterns; it really rammed it home that there weren't any genuine moments - they were purely manipulative and abusive.' Throughout the time they were together, Dines was married to someone else; his parents were alive and well. When his deployment was over, he left a note on the kitchen table telling her that he needed some space and abruptly disappeared. There can be no clearer example of misogyny within the Met than the undercover police division's treatment of these women, who were duped into relationships by officers who used them to construct convincing alter egos, to mask the surveillance work they were doing on small, mostly left-leaning and non-violent protest groups. 'I still don't think the police get it. That was our purpose in writing this book - we wanted to expose the institutional sexism that allowed these relationships to happen and to stop more women being abused by officers. It's very easy for an individual's experience to be written off as a glitch, or just the responsibility of an individual officer, but the strength of us writing our story together - you start to see patterns, and it is the patterns that demonstrate that this was a systemic problem,' she says. Even people who think they are familiar with the broad outlines of the undercover cop scandal will be astonished by the contents of Deep Deception. The book weaves together the women's experiences chronologically, revealing in horrifying detail how they were each tricked into relationships. One of the women lived for five years with a man with whom she hoped to have children, before he disappeared unexpectedly and without trace; it turned out he had been married with three young children throughout the time they had been together. Another had a relationship stretching more than seven years, while another from their group had two children with an officer, believing that he had genuine feelings for her. 'The betrayal and the Orwellian surveillance behind it have devastated lives,' the introduction notes. But the book is a triumphant exercise in exploding the women's status as victims; it goes on to describe their success in subsequently exposing the cynical and sordid full extent of the spy cops operation. Steel is not sure whether she was selected randomly as a way of giving Dines credibility within the activist community, or if she was targeted because of her involvement in the McDonald's campaign. Shortly after they began their relationship in the early 90s, she was walking with Dines back to his flat when she was served with a libel writ by McDonald's over a leaflet she had helped produce highlighting the environmental damage caused by the burger chain; she now believes he must have been involved in helping organise for the writ to be served. The case would become the longest-running legal battle in English history. Steel and her co-defendant, Dave Morris (an unemployed postal worker), became famous globally for their dogged refusal to apologise in the face of McDonald's multimillion-pound lawsuit. As Steel prepared her defence, Dines would obligingly pick her up from meetings with the young lawyer who was helping her - a newly qualified Keir Starmer - enabling him to hear all about the defence arguments as he drove her home. Later it would emerge that another undercover officer from the same SDS unit had helped draft the offending leaflet. 'They targeted anyone with a desire to protest against the status quo, anyone attempting to hold the government or big business to account. Only a handful of far-right groups were infiltrated among the many hundreds of leftwing ones,' she says. 'A large part of their function seemed to be to protect corporate interests.'This riveting book exposes repeat patterns of abusive behaviour by the undercover cops, revealing how the men used well-honed strategies for building up relationships and jettisoning them at the end of the deployment. The officers were adept at a method known as 'mirroring': subtly latching on to things the women were interested in and later declaring that they, too, shared those same passions - the same music, politics, books, commitment to vegetarianism. It becomes clear that they were passing on tips and guidance to each other on how to manipulate the women they were using to provide a front for their undercover work. The undercover officers had vans and flexible work that made them available for transporting people to and from activist meetings - allowing them to eavesdrop on plans. The freelance nature of their pretend jobs (as gardeners, carpenters or delivery drivers) also permitted them to disappear for protracted stretches to spend time with their real families. They exited suddenly, after announcing they were having breakdowns and needed space; they disappeared to South Africa or the US and appeared to be untraceable. The women were devastated at the abrupt end of relationships, upset for themselves, but also worried about the welfare of the defenceless, lonely men they had loved. Steel's story has been written about previously (not least in the excellent Undercover, by the Guardian journalists Rob Evans and Paul Lewis), but the extent to which her life was messed up by the decision of Dines to dupe her into a relationship is laid bare in this book. It is a shocking and at times painful-to-read series of dizzying, life-shattering deceptions. For a while, Steel had some residual affection for Dines; it was hard to believe that there had been nothing genuine in his behaviour towards her over the two years they had lived together. Subsequently, she has met more than two dozen other women similarly abused and her gaze has hardened. The Met continues to insist that these relationships were unsanctioned misdemeanours committed by individual rogue officers, but Steel believes this is nonsense. 'We could see that what had seemed like heart-wrenching stories told by the officers at the time were so similar they could only have come through shared practice. It was chilling,' she says. Four of the women behind the book have chosen to remain anonymous, but Steel long ago abandoned any attempt to box off this chunk of her life. She writes with powerful rage about the women's continuing battle for justice. 'We were often portrayed as victims with no agency and we wanted to show that it was our detective work that uncovered this scandal, and to show that fighting back against those abuses was an empowering experience,' she says.Although there have been public apologies and financial settlements for some of the women, the book highlights how energetically the police continues to obstruct the women's campaign to get answers. In a post #MeToo era, at a time when the Met is facing the fallout from its handling of Sarah Everard's death, it seems remarkable that the force is resisting these women's requests for disclosure about the details of their cases, by refusing to release the files on them. 'These are akin to Stasi files. All kinds of information was put down in these police files. It is grossly intrusive. There's no justification in a democracy for keeping those kinds of files,' Steel says. It is particularly startling to register how consistently the women's experiences have been trivialised in the years since they exposed the unit's actions. A judge hearing their case in 2013 described the police officers as 'cads'. Another judge, Mr Justice Tugendhat, hearing a different part of the case that year, made a peculiar reference to James Bond to provide context for the behaviour of the police, arguing that the fictional spy's behaviour showed how the intelligence services had for years used 'officers to form personal relationships of an intimate sexual nature ... in order to obtain information or access'. The women were treated dismissively during a home affairs select committee hearing. Writing in the Daily Mail in 2014, Richard Littlejohn derided the women as 'an assortment of unwashed dopey birds who slept with undercover officers'. Most significantly, an attempt to prosecute the officers for rape and sexual assault failed in 2014, when the Crown Prosecution Service concluded that there was 'insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction'. The CPS decision not to prosecute the officers was 'absolutely outrageous; totally sexist,' Steel says. 'There is no way that we would have consented to these relationships had we known who these men really were and what their purpose was in our lives.' The deception made the women think they were going mad; most were later diagnosed with serious psychological injuries including post-traumatic stress, extreme anxiety, depression and panic attacks. Steel discovered in 1994, through impressive, forensic investigation, that Dines, whom she knew as John Barker, had stolen the identity of a child who had died at eight of leukaemia; some time later, she realised that he was a member of the SDS. Writing the book meant she had to go through diaries and letters from the time of the relationship; she was shocked by how unkind he had been in his treatment of her, particularly the manner of his departure, when he left her and returned repeatedly over several months, telling her he loved her and feeding her new lies about his grief for his fictitiously dead parents. Rereading the letters 'really struck home just how abusive and manipulative he was. And that made me really angry; it was as if he set out to destroy my sanity.' Dines, who later moved to Australia, has never explained his behaviour. Steel managed to track him down in 2016 and speak to him at Sydney airport (the mobile phone footage of that brief meeting is worth watching, as a fleeting insight into Dines' callous dismissal of what he has done).  'As far as we know, not a single one of them has faced any consequences for their actions, not even the docking of their pensions,' she says. The impact on the women, however, has been profound. Steel's faith in her judgment was shattered, so it took a long time before she was able to have another relationship, which meant by the time she started trying to have a family it was difficult. She had seven miscarriages and was ultimately unable to have children. 'It has severely affected our ability to trust other people, or to form intimate relationships again. You can't compensate for that,' she says, noting that even the state compensation system does not see the world from a woman's perspective, being more inclined to focus on loss of earnings. She is unimpressed by the effusive police apology issued in 2015, which she thinks does not sit well with the persistent refusal to release the women's files so that they can properly understand why they were targeted and the nature of the information held on them. 'There is a tension between them claiming it should never have happened and saying they think it's appalling, and refusing to tell us the truth about the extent of it and who knew,' she says. In response to the book, the Met reiterated its regret, stating: 'Undercover policing has changed significantly with independent judicial oversight of all operations, and past events highlighted in this book in no way reflect modern-day undercover policing. We recognise the hurt and distress caused to the authors of this book. The actions of undercover officers who deceived these women into sexual relationships were totally unacceptable.' A public inquiry into undercover policing has been running since 2015, but progress has been severely hampered by police requests for secrecy. The hearings restarted this week, however the sessions relating to the women's experiences are not expected to begin until next year. 'The public inquiry has been bending over backwards to protect the privacy and feelings of the former undercover officers. There is no concern for our privacy and our right to know,' Steel says. 'We all want answers. If the police want to raid someone's house, they have to apply for a warrant and they have to set out the reasons why they need to search the house. But with these relationships, no warrants needed to be applied for. They were living in our houses and they had access to everything we had in our homes; they had access to the contents of our heads. They could ask us whatever questions they wanted and we would answer - believing they were our trusted partners, not an undercover cop trying to get information. It was disgusting and inhumane abuse.' Deep Deception is published by Ebury Spotlight (PS20). To support the Guardian and Observer, order your copy at guardianbookshop.com.

It was 2013 and I had picked a grassy patch near a bridle path, where I listened to the wind rustling through the trees as raindrops bounced off my nylon roof. I had always assumed something like this was going to happen to me. It had felt almost inevitable for years. When viewed in isolation, my journey to the streets seems entirely of my own making. I had racked up considerable rent arrears, I was drinking heavily and I had left my flat without being evicted. I went to live in a tent and on random sofas for a few weeks, before moving into a charitable homeless hostel. Surely it was all my fault? I wish I could say I was forced on to the streets by an unscrupulous landlord, addiction to hard drugs or something more dramatic, but sloth, shame and overwhelming paranoia were what did it. It was as if I needed to check out, to yield to a tide that was out of my control, to let it wash me up where it wanted. But the more I dug into my journey, the more it became clear that I had been failed repeatedly along the way - from the special-education boarding school to the care home, the police, the precarious jobs and the effects of austerity. Some will be surprised that I am writing this - alongside a book - at all. People with my background don't normally make it into print. But this is my story. In 1997, when I was 11, my key worker entered my classroom and presented me with a small, green paper parcel, which she unfurled, revealing a thick, white powder. I leaned forward and gathered as much of it as I could with my tongue, making sure not to miss a speck. I was told the bitter taste in my mouth was going to make me better; make me good. The classroom was in a special-education boarding school - let's call it Dippydale - for children with learning, emotional and behavioural difficulties. I was there because, since as soon as I could form memories, I had been told there was something wrong with me - and they had a point. The psychiatrist who diagnosed me with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) when I was seven didn't need to strain his diagnostic skills. During our first session, I did my best Spider-Man impression on his bookshelves when I was supposed to be arranging a series of simple pictures into logical sequences. I burned all my bridges with mainstream education, so, at 11, I ended up at Dippydale. The school was in the middle of nowhere, on the foreboding West Pennine Moors. Emotional outbursts, fights and restraints routinely disrupted teaching. The soundtrack to the school's corridors was: 'Get the fuck off me, now!' The favoured restraint was known as the B-52. It involved lining up three chairs next to each other and plonking an unfortunate child on the middle chair, with two members of staff flanking them, locking the child's arms across their laps with one hand and pushing the child's head down with the other. It was named after the bomber presumably because the contorted child resembled a plane. Restraints were a rite of passage at the school and I soon had my turn. I had enuresis (I wet the bed). There were four boys to a room in the boarding house, so it was impossible to hide this embarrassing problem. My key worker at the time - let's call him Mr Lanky - thought he could remedy this by waltzing into my bedroom every morning before my roommates had awoken to ask me if I was dry - only he would spell it out, as if that would keep it secret. 'Are you D-R-Y?' he would ask. We might have been div kids, but we could still spell - and smell. I didn't need excuses to distract myself from schoolwork and behave badly, but the bullying gave me some anyway. My first B-52 came after I refused to go back inside after breaktime over petty frustrations on the football pitch. I was dragged back into the music room by two teachers and restrained. I knew all the lyrics to the school's soundtrack by this point and belted them out with furious gusto: 'Get the fuck off me now, you bastards!' I was so upset and helpless as I sat there, immobilised in pain, that I spat on the floor in frustration. A third teacher, who was standing over me, took a tissue, gathered up my spittle and wiped it over my face. I didn't think much of the restraints at the time; they were like clockwork at school. Now, I perceive them almost as injustices that happened to someone else, a little boy I knew a long time ago. A 2016 study funded by the National Institutes of Health in the US found that ADHD substantially increased the risk of homelessness. The study tracked 134 boys aged between six and 12 diagnosed with ADHD in the 1970s. When they caught up with the boys three decades later, they found that 24% of them had been homeless, more than five times the rate for a control group of neurotypical children. Like me, many homeless adults start on their route to destitution in childhood. According to a 2018 survey conducted by Evolve Housing, a London-based homeless charity, 79% of the 156 participants reported at least one childhood trauma. While Evolve stops short of claiming there is a causal link between childhood trauma and homelessness, it does say there is 'a disproportionally high level of those experiencing homelessness following traumatic childhood experiences'. Even if there is no causal link, I was about to add to the neurological disorder and trauma via a different conduit to homelessness. I never thought I would go into care. It seemed like a horror story, an abstraction exclusive to fictional characters or people in the news. But by the time I reached the front door of my new foster home, my life was spiralling from one catastrophe to the next. This was just the latest one. As well as my disrupted education and bad behaviour, my mum's budding relationship with my new stepdad was adding to tensions at home. He and I now get on. He is my dad, I love him and that's that. But our relationship has been fraught over the years. Dad was an entertaining chastiser. He had a series of greatest hits that could have filled a double-sided compilation album: Now That's What I Call a Bollocking. My all-time favourite was when he told me off for relentlessly teasing my brother on one hyperactive afternoon at my grandma's house: 'Now listen, boy, and listen well!' he growled. 'You're nine years old now; you're halfway to being 18!' He was halfway to being 60 at the time, so by his logic we should have been preparing for his retirement. Looking back, I don't blame my parents. I was a little bastard at the best of times and my parents, who had problems of their own and were offered little support from social services, were not equipped to cope. Children in care are more likely to leave school with fewer qualifications than children who remain at home. They are more likely to be unemployed, to have mental illness and to enter the criminal justice system. It is almost as if the care system trains children for destitution. After a year in the system, I was expelled from Dippydale and finished my secondary education at 15, with no qualifications. In the same year, I had my first run-in with the police. The staff had already lost control of the kids under their charge before I arrived at a claustrophobic children's home in Manchester. Bad behaviour went unpunished or was penalised inconsistently. All this taught us was that we could do what we wanted and there would be no penalties until things got so out of hand that the police had to be called. Then, instead of a grounding or a dock in pocket money, we earned a criminal record. The first time I got nicked, I and a few other kids decided that breaking furniture and shouting abuse at the staff was preferable to going to bed. Aside from exhaustion, police intervention was probably the only thing that would have stopped us that night. But a 999 call could have been avoided if the staff weren't so inconsistent and incompetent. I ended up in handcuffs on several occasions after that, once for breaking a mug. Often the police would come just to make sure we went to bed. The little respect we had for the staff disappeared as soon as they had us criminalised; rebelling against them became our raison d'etre. It all came to a head on one sunny summer afternoon. Lucy, who was 14 and the only girl living at the home, was visited by Hamza, her 18-year-old boyfriend. He was hanging around with her on the front doorstep. Lucy wanted to come back into the unit for a drink, but the staff told her she couldn't come in if Hamza was still on the premises. He refused to go. Lucy shouted obscenities through the letterbox: 'Let me in, you fuckin' dick'eds; it's my house, yeah?' she said, cackling. 'Yo, Danny! Carter! Let us in, man!' Not wanting to miss out on the fun, Carter, the lanky 'top boy' of the unit, and I obliged. Two male staff members were on that day. Let's call them Gramps (he had a white beard) and Titch (he was tiny). Meanwhile, Joyless (she was mean) was manning the office. Titch put his hand on the door to try to keep it shut, but Carter managed to overpower him. Gramps had been blocking my path, but when Carter got the door open, Gramps rushed over to shut it, giving me enough space to slip past him and over the threshold. The staff locked the door behind us and shook their heads in disgust as we flipped them off from outside. Hamza distracted us from tormenting the staff when he produced the gun he had brought along. I don't know if it was real, but it looked real enough, and Hamza got nervous when we turned the barrel on Titch and Gramps through the window. Things went on like this for a while until we grew bored and wanted to come back in. The staff insisted we enter one at a time, but as soon as they opened the door for me to go in, an almighty scuffle broke out as Hamza and Carter attempted to force their way inside with me. Gramps had Hamza in a chokehold, while Carter had Titch in a clinch and was thrusting his knee sharply, relentlessly, into Titch's face. Eventually, Titch crumpled to the floor. Carter then rushed outside and attempted to pick up one of the boulders lying on a flower bed close to the entrance. 'Why aren't you doing anything, you pussy?' he shouted to me as I stood there, frozen. He couldn't lift the boulder and went for a fire extinguisher near the door instead. Hamza had managed to wriggle free before Carter could put the extinguisher to use, but a flurry of punches and kicks followed, then sirens. Carter, Lucy and Hamza fled past me. I was still rooted to the spot, staring in disbelief at Gramps and Titch's unconscious, bloodied bodies. 'C'mon!' Carter shouted as he dragged me away. I found my feet and sprinted after them. The air was filled with deafening sirens - and they were for us. We ran as fast as we could, for as long as we could - longer than we had ever run before. When we stopped - when we could no longer hear sirens - it felt like my whole body had become engorged and my tongue was made of copper. Carter and I watched Hamza and Lucy make their way up a long, dark street with red-brick terrace houses on either side. They stopped at one near the end and were invited in after a brief chat at the front door. Hamza looked at us and shook his head apologetically as he crossed the threshold with Lucy. By now, it was getting dark. The uniformity of the red terraces under the ugly orange streetlamps was the perfect backdrop for our bleak circumstances. 'We could go to my gran's house,' I suggested to Carter. 'Yeah? Where does she live?' he said. 'Greenfield,' I said. Carter managed a laugh. 'Nah. Mission, that.' 'What are we gonna do then?' I asked. 'Go back,' he said. Carter started walking. 'If we go back, we'll get lifted,' I said. 'I'll get lifted. Fuck all's gonna 'appen to you,' he said. 'How do you know?' I asked. 'Because I know! You didn't do owt, did you?'  We didn't talk much on the way home. The adrenaline that kept us on our toes for more than four miles had sapped from our bodies and left cold reality behind. We knew Carter had ruined his life; the slow march home felt like a funeral procession. We arrived back and I knocked on the door as Carter took a seat on the bottom rung of the railings that ran along the front-door steps, the same place where all the drama began. Joyless came to the door with Biker (he commuted by bike from Halifax), a stout thirtysomething care worker for whom no one had much time. Joyless was wearing a look of revulsion as she appeared at the door. 'Just you,' she said to me. I looked back at Carter. 'Told you. Go on,' he said. What began as defiance of the rules, broken curfews, midnight pantry raids and abusive tantrums escalated to criminal damage and grievous bodily harm in a matter of months. It didn't have to be this way. Government guidelines say that the police should not be used to manage low-level behaviour problems or matters that a 'reasonable parent' would not have called the police about. When children go into care, it is invariably because their family situation has broken down. After this happens, the state becomes the parent and is responsible for their welfare. My experience was two decades ago, but criminalisation is still common in the care system. It is not surprising that about 27% of the prison population comprises care-leavers when practically everyone I lived with in care finished their time with a criminal record. Even though Carter, Lucy and I didn't know it yet, our behaviour would shape our futures and make lives embroiled in poverty, crime and destitution almost certain. When I left care, I had already lived at 14 addresses. I would bounce between council flats and bedsits another seven times before I ended up in that tent. Many of the mistakes I have made are my own, but I can't help thinking that if social services had handled my transition to independence better, if readiness - instead of the arbitrariness of age - determined when care leavers could stand on their own two feet, maybe I would have made something of my life sooner. When I was 21, I worked a full-time job and took night classes. In 2010, I made it to university. But I couldn't look after myself. I struggled to budget and keep a routine and was generally disorganised, my attention always anywhere but the present. By the end of my third year, with care support long gone, I was firmly in the grip of mental illness and dependency. My grandparents, to whom I was close, had died over those three years and one of my best friends died suddenly, too; my mother was hospitalised with multiple organ failure; and some of my immediate family members were struggling with substance abuse and were in trouble with the police (one was placed in a psychiatric ward). All of this caused me to withdraw into myself. Towards the end of my degree, in May 2013, I was in thousands of pounds of arrears and became paranoid about debt collectors visiting me. It was this that made me resort to pitching a tent. After 18 months bouncing around the hostel system, I managed to pull myself together enough to complete a master's degree and become a journalist - I have even won a few awards. But if your take from this is that I am living proof that upward mobility is all about grit and determination, then you should know that I am a walking, talking anomaly. Almost everyone I know from the system is damaged. They are off the map, in prison or dead. Things have not improved. According to analysis by WPI Economics for the charities St Mungo's and Homeless Link, spending by English local authorities on homelessness-related activity fell by 27% between 2008-09 and 2017-18. During this time, the number of rough sleepers more than doubled. It is true that people like me are more likely to become homeless at some point in their lives, but the fact is that homelessness can happen to almost anyone. You may have had a perfect paint-by-numbers existence: good schools, straight As, a glowing career, a flourishing social life and a supportive family. Then, one day, you are blindsided by illness, redundancy, a relationship breakdown, a rogue landlord or some other unforeseen circumstance and find yourself on your arse. If we want to end housing insecurity and eliminate endemic homelessness, we must embark on a radical and comprehensive social housebuilding programme. In the past five years, I have lived in four properties across London. One of those was a temporary placement; in two others, I had to leave due to dishonest landlords. At the time of writing, I am living in another box in south-east London. I don't have many possessions and the walls of the box remain pasty and bare. Decorating seems futile. At the back of my mind, I know I can never settle; the next eviction letter is on the horizon and will soon be in my face, propelling me into another frantic race against time to find my next four walls. I worry that I will fail this time, that I will get the letter during a pinch and will have to go through all of this again.

Although Johnson's key guarantee is necessarily a political declaration, as opposed to an international treaty guarantee, the British commitment was of high value at a time of great tension, Anna Wieslander, the Atlantic Council's northern Europe director said on Wednesday. Johnson's visits were designed to reassure the populations of both countries that in practical military defence terms key Nato countries, if not Nato collectively, are committed bilaterally to the Nordic countries' defence if subject to attack or sustained Russian intimidation. The UK statement goes further than any bilateral guarantees made so far by any other Nato country and is designed to cover the potentially vulnerable transition period between Nato membership application and full membership, the point at which Nato's full article 5 collective defence protections kicks in. That transition is perceived as the moment of maximum risk for Stockholm and Helsinki and could last as long as 12 months as each of the 30 Nato states must ratify their membership. In a visit to Washington last week Ann Linde, the Swedish foreign minister, was given a broad security assurance by Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state. Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor also promised to back the Nordics' Nato membership when the Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, and her Finnish counterpart, Sanna Marin, travelled to Berlin last week. Bjorn Fagersten, senior research fellow at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs, said the British offer 'gives an extra layer of assurance in the event of an attack. It is written down and Boris Johnson was quite specific in terms of talking about increased deployments by the military, air force and naval operations.' Wieslander said 'at a time of very high tension in the region, it is of great value, and partly because it builds on what exists already through the agreements made at the time of the setting up of the joint expeditionary force in 2015. It also sends a signal to Russia that a nuclear power is willing to do this. I would expect the US to do something similar.' The declaration could not come in the form of a fully fledged treaty since that might take as long to ratify as Sweden's Nato membership. In a decision that cuts deep into Swedish self-identity, the ruling Social Democrat board will decide on Sunday whether to end 200 years of neutrality, although many say the cooperation between Finland and Sweden with Nato members has been so close it was tantamount to Nato membership. Leftwing critics have said Sweden is behaving like a reindeer in a herd, running in the same direction as the rest.  Fagersten said the meeting of the Social Democrats governing board was 'the key decision point', and predicted the party would join the non-left opposition parties in backing membership. 'The statements from former foreign ministers such as Margot Wallstrom and the fact that Social Democrats have brought forward the decision to coincide with Finland's timetable suggest there will be support.' Asked if he thought Johnson was the best message carrier to take into the Swedish social democratic debate, he said: 'I don't think Brexit or Partygate will affect Sweden's thinking. We have seen that Britain has been pretty supportive of Ukraine from an early stage, and that has increased its credibility. Britain is a pretty popular country here. We would still like you to be EU members, but we cooperate a lot.' Support for Nato membership has not trailed off in Sweden since the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. A poll conducted by Demoskop for the daily newspaper Aftonbladet showed support for Nato membership still rising and reaching 61 %. The same organisation's poll published on 20 April showed 57% of Swedes in favour of joining Nato, up from 51% in March. In addition, more than two-thirds of the Finnish parliament, according to surveys, now supports Nato membership. Finland, an EU member, has managed to balance criticism of Russia with a bridge-building role with Moscow, but may find that role harder to play once inside an alliance seen as Russia's enemy. Defence experts are stressing that Sweden could maintain its special role in advocating peace and disarmament by following Norway and Denmark, two founding Nato members, in making a condition of membership a ban on their soil of both nuclear weapons in peacetime and permanent foreign troops. In practice this does not prevent near permanent rotational forces or pre-positioning of supplies. Security service chiefs have been surprised by the lack of direct Russian disinformation efforts in the Nordic debates, and Fagersten said it was possible that future Russian interference would focus instead in one of the 30 Nato states that would have to ratify the treaty possibly over the next 12 months. He said it was also possible Russia, preoccupied by the Ukraine front, simply did not have the resources to respond to the unforeseen emergence of a new Nato flank. Asked what kind of disruption was possible, Wieslander said: 'The expectations are cyberattack, disinformation campaigns, electronic jamming, intrusions in our airspace, even something more official, that they have moved Iskander missiles into Kaliningrad [a Russian exclave sandwiched between Lithuania and Poland on the Baltic coast], but they have played with this card before. Their methods are designed to be ambiguous.'", "58a058118cf82e663677958c05c345e064b3e3938315f358b533288c": "", "8175c33005ce6132b78d54097ad2519230ae71fef69df1aca09caa02": "", "80f71c29fafdf2fad76571344942b8131433c0f7bbb6856ffc988d9d": "", "15a9d1ed608df28465e991b3b790c3facecefb2f2bce4cf5f3c7bb72": "Finland is expected to announce its intention to join Nato on Thursday with Sweden likely to follow soon after, diplomats and officials have said, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine reshapes European security and the Atlantic military alliance. Nato allies expect Finland and Sweden to be granted membership quickly, five diplomats and officials told Reuters, paving the way for increased troop presence in the Nordic region during the one-year ratification period. In the lead-up to their Nato accession, British prime minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday promised to defend Sweden and Finland against potential Russian threats as he travelled to both countries to sign mutual security agreements. In the wider Nordic region, Norway, Denmark and the three Baltic states are already Nato members, and the addition of Finland and Sweden would probably anger Moscow, which says enlargement of the organisation is a direct threat to its own security. Russian president Vladimir Putin has cited the issue as a reason for his actions in Ukraine, which has also expressed a desire to eventually join the alliance. Moscow has also repeatedly warned Finland and Sweden against joining the alliance, threatening 'serious military and political consequences'. Asked on Wednesday if Finland would provoke Russia by joining Nato, President Sauli Niinisto said Putin would be to blame. 'My response would be that you caused this. Look at the mirror,' Niinisto said. On Thursday European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen warned Russia was the 'most direct threat' to the international order because of its 'barbaric' war in Ukraine. Von der Leyen and European Council president Charles Michel are in Japan for talks that have touched on Russia's invasion of Ukraine but also growing concerns about China's role in Asia and beyond. Russia 'is today the most direct threat to the world order with the barbaric war against Ukraine, and its worrying pact with China,' she said after talks with Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida. On the frontlines, Ukraine on Wednesday said it had pushed back Russian forces in the east and shut gas flows on a route through Russian-held territory, raising the spectre of an energy crisis in Europe. Ukraine's armed forces' general staff said it had recaptured Pytomnyk, a village on the main highway north of the second-largest city of Kharkiv, about halfway to the Russian border. In another village near Kharkiv recaptured by Ukrainian forces in early April, resident Tatyana Pochivalova returned to find her home blasted to ruins. 'I have not expected anything like this, such aggression, such destruction,' a weeping Pochivalova said. 'I came and I kissed the ground, I simply kissed it. My home, there is nothing. Where am I to live, how am I to live?' The advance appears to be the fastest that Ukraine has mounted since it drove Russian troops away from the capital Kyiv and out of northern Ukraine at the beginning of April. If sustained, it could let Ukrainian forces threaten supply lines for Russia's main attack force, and put rear logistics targets in Russia itself within range of artillery. However, a senior US military official has warned that neither side can win in the present circumstances and that Russian and Ukrainian forces appear to be settling into a gruelling and deadly stalemate in Ukraine's east. Despite an announcement from Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that Ukrainian counter-offensives around the city of Kharkiv were pushing invading Russian forces back, Ukrainian successes appeared to be confined for now to the far north-eastern and south-western flanks of the 300-mile frontline. 'The Russians aren't winning, and the Ukrainians aren't winning, and we're at a bit of a stalemate here,' said Lt Gen Scott Berrier, director of the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency, who gave evidence on Tuesday alongside Avril Haines, the US national intelligence director, to the Senate armed forces committee. The assessment was delivered as the Russian military claimed its forces had advanced as far as the border between the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, potentially edging to securing control of the Donbas region despite losing ground around Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. The developments came as Ukraine said it was shutting down Russian gas flows through territory held by Russian-backed separatists - the first time the conflict has directly disrupted shipments to Europe. For its part Moscow has imposed sanctions on the owner of the Polish part of the Yamal pipeline that carries Russian gas to Europe, as well as Gazprom's former German unit, whose subsidiaries service Europe's gas consumption. The implications for Europe, which buys more than a third of its gas from Russia, were not immediately clear. Berlin said it was looking into the announcement. An economy ministry spokesperson said the German government was 'taking the necessary precautions and preparing for various scenarios'. In southern Ukraine, where Russia has seized a swathe of territory, Kyiv has said Moscow plans to hold a fake referendum on independence or annexation to cement its occupation. Russian forces have also continued to bombard the Azovstal steelworks in the southern port of Mariupol, last bastion of Ukrainian defenders in a city 'If there is hell on earth, it is there,' wrote Petro Andryushchenko, an aide to the Mariupol mayor, Vadym Boichenko, who has left the city. Ukraine says it is likely that tens of thousands of people have been killed in Mariupol. Ukrainian authorities say between 150,000 and 170,000 of the city's 400,000 residents are still living there amid the Russian-occupied ruins. With Reuters", "a631d7c85e9c3112f3037594803c3604e65374e2ae688e0cf562deef": "The Russian-controlled administration in the Ukrainian city of Kherson has said it plans to request annexation by Moscow, a move that would confirm the Kremlin's permanent occupation of Ukrainian territory captured since February. If Russia attempts to annex the Kherson region it would make a peace agreement more unlikely, as Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said that Russia's withdrawal to prewar positions was a precondition for any successful negotiation. It is not clear whether the Kremlin will go forward with an annexation or is using it as a threat to put pressure on Kyiv. The annexation call was made on Wednesday by Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the military administration Russia put in place to run Kherson in late April. Russia occupied Kherson in March and seized its city council building in late April. 'The city of Kherson is Russia; there will be no the KNR [Kherson People's Republic] on the territory of the Kherson region, there will be no referendums,' said Stremousov in a televised briefing. 'It will be a single decree based on the appeal of the leadership of the Kherson region to the president of the Russian Federation, and there will be a request to make [Kherson] into a full-fledged region of the Russian Federation.' Stremousov previously said that Kherson would begin using the rouble currency, a move seen as creeping integration into Russia. Russian officials who have visited Kherson have promised not to abandon the region. 'Russia is here to stay forever,' said Andrei Turchak, secretary general of Russia's ruling United Russia party, while visiting Kherson last week. 'There should be no doubt about it. There will be no return to the past.' But similar requests for annexation from territories such as the Russian-controlled Donetsk People's Republic have languished for years, as the Kremlin has dangled integration while seeking to put pressure on Kyiv. Putin began his new war in Ukraine by announcing the independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, territories with local administrations also controlled by Russia. While there have been rumours they could hold new referendums to demand accession into Russia, that has not yet taken place. Local leaders say their model outcome is that of Crimea, the peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014 after a referendum under a puppet government. But few Russians have a similar attachment to the Kherson, Donetsk, or Luhansk regions, or want to see them as part of the Russian Federation. Turchak gave a careful answer when asked if Kherson would become part of Russia: 'Let's not get ahead of ourselves. In any case, the status will be determined by the residents,' he said. That view was echoed by the Kremlin on Wednesday, with its spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, saying any appeal should be 'decided by the residents of the Kherson region ... and residents of the Kherson region should also determine their fate'. He also said the decision would have to be vetted by lawyers and legal experts to be 'absolutely legitimate, as it was with Crimea'. Analysts have said that the call for annexation without a referendum indicated the weakness of the Russian position in those regions. Russia 'doesn't feel stable on occupied areas, they can't afford even fake referendum as in 2014. No local support at all,' wrote Maria Zolkina, a political analyst at Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation, a Kyiv-based thinktank. Ukrainian officials, meanwhile, vowed that the Kherson region would be recaptured before any annexation could take place. 'The invaders may ask to join even Mars or Jupiter. The Ukrainian army will liberate Kherson, no matter what games with words they play,' said Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential adviser.", "e7e2182c1d1dc0dd355661e6d39b2107aacc45b715121b21ee4216b2": "Three Russian prisoners of war accused of targeting or murdering civilians, and a soldier who allegedly killed a man before raping his wife, are set to be in the dock in the first war crimes trials of the Ukraine conflict, the Ukrainian prosecutor general has revealed. More than 10,700 crimes have been registered since the war began by the office of Ukraine's prosecutor general, led by Iryna Venediktova, and a handful of cases have now been filed or are ready to be submitted in what marks a watershed moment two months into the war. Vadim Shysimarin, a 21-year-old commander of the Kantemirovskaya Tank Division, who is currently in Ukrainian custody, is expected to be the first to face trial over his alleged murder of a 68-year-old man. It is alleged Shysimarin, a sergeant, had been fighting in the Sumy region in north-east Ukraine when he killed a civilian on 28 February in the village of Chupakhivka. He is accused of driving a stolen car with four other soldiers as he sought to flee Ukrainian fighters and then shooting dead the unarmed man on a bicycle as he was talking on his phone. He was ordered 'to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders', according to prosecutors. The crime is said to have happened close to the victim's house and was committed using an AK-74. The case has this week been filed at a criminal court. 'He is here [in Ukraine], we have him,' said Venediktova, speaking from her heavily fortified headquarters in Kyiv. A spokesperson added: 'Prosecutors and investigators of the SBU [Ukrainian secret services] have collected enough evidence of his involvement in violation of the laws and customs of war combined with premeditated murder. For these actions, he faces 10 to 15 years in prison or life in prison.' Separately, on 24 February, the day Vladimir Putin's 'special military operation'was launched, it is alleged two Russian soldiers using a Soviet truck-mounted 122mm multiple rocket launcher carried out artillery shelling of homes and civilian buildings in the village of Kozacha Lopan in Kharkiv district. They also allegedly hit an 'educational institution' in the city of Dergachiv, from Belgorod in Russia. The soldiers later crossed over the border of Ukraine and continued shelling targets in the Kharkiv region, it is claimed, but they were taken prisoner by Ukrainian forces and now await trial. Their case file, laying out charges of breaking the laws and customs of war, has also been filed at a criminal procedural court in Ukraine, but names and photographs are yet to be issued. In a final case that is probably heading to a trial in absentia, a soldier named as Mikhail Romanov, who has a large tattoo of a bear on his chest, is accused of breaking into a house in March in a village in the Brovarsky region, murdering a man and then repeatedly raping his wife while 'threatening her and her underage child with violence and weapons'. A second soldier also raped the 33-year-old woman, who has a four-year-old son. The case is yet to be filed at court but the prosecutor's office was able to provide a photograph from social media that has been used by the victim to identify the man who allegedly attacked her. Romanov's apparent partner was contacted for comment by this newspaper but she did not respond to questions. Of Romanov, Venediktova said: 'Now we don't know where he is - maybe he is fighting still, maybe he is on rotation in the Russian federation, maybe he is dead. We don't know but we want to prosecute him in absentia.' She added: 'We want to demonstrate to these criminals that we will find them. And we will prevent the deaths of other people in other territories.' Venediktova, who on Monday travelled to the border with Poland to meet the UK attorney general, Suella Braverman, who has provided her with a former international criminal court judge as an adviser, said 36 identified war crimes suspects were currently being prosecuted, with various levels of progress. Venediktova, whose office desk has a dozen hotlines, including one to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said she feared many more crimes would emerge from the territories in the east and south of Ukraine currently occupied by Russia, including the devastated port city of Mariupol. Venediktova, who keeps a Russian cluster bomb casing that was found in Kherson, a city in south Ukraine, on her desk, said countless atrocities were being committed. She said: 'I have a theory that the Russian federation decided that when they come to Ukraine everyone will be happy to see them but when they understood that the whole population was fighting against them, against a common enemy, they decided to do everything to scare the population.' At the end of March videos emerged of alleged war crimes committed by Ukrainian soldiers against Russian prisoners of war, including a film that appeared to show three soldiers being shot in the legs. Venediktova said her office was continuing to investigate those claims and others. She said: 'We shall not act as barbarians but as people who understand the rule of law. We are still investigating but as I understand some of the facts could be fake. [But] there is not only one case where we started investigations, we have several.'", "78f6b7896467ea006bb1358c1a16b1e4f47a575a8f5232295223c88f": "There's an acrid smell in the air and an unsettling crunch underfoot as we step over the metallic black and gold detritus of war. Ahead of us, framed by tree branches amputated by tank shells and mortar fire, the sky is reflecting brilliantly on the shimmering flood waters. After negotiating more than a dozen army checkpoints within the thick forests of Kyiv's outer boundary, we have reached the flooded village of Demydiv on the Irpin River and the long-lost wetland basin, which has returned after the dam was opened by Ukrainian troops defending the capital from Russian army units, and was later struck by a missile. The breaching of the Irpin dam at the end of February held back the Russian soldiers and tanks, and reflooded 13,000 hectares (32,000 acres) of wetlands that were drained by the Soviets in the 1960s. Until the outbreak of war, the floodplain was due to be become the foundations of a massive new housing development. But with the waters possibly back for good, the future of the fragile ecology - and that of local communities - is uncertain. Local ecologist Volodymyr Boreyko is calling for the Irpin River to be given the title of 'Hero River', and for Ukraine to follow the precedent set by Ecuador in 2008, when it became the first country in the world to recognise the rights of nature in its constitution. 'I think the Irpin River should be awarded the title of 'Hero River' and be given strong environmental protections, because this year the Irpin, in tandem with the UAF [Ukrainian armed forces] and territorial defence forces, played one of the most important roles in the defence of our capital for the last 1,000 years,' says Boreyko. The large construction projects previously approved for the Irpin floodplain should be cancelled, he adds. The battle for Kyiv wasn't the only time the Irpin has saved the city and, without it, he says, Kyiv would be left vulnerable to attack in the future. 'A thousand years ago, in the days of Kyivan Rus, the Irpin River repeatedly protected Kyiv from the north and north-west from the attacks of the Polovtsians and Pechenegs. It is 162km (101 miles) long, and its floodplain is so wide and swampy, enemy cavalry could not pass. 'If Putin had attacked in a year or two from now, the river Irpin would not have been able to defend the capital because its entire floodplain would have been cemented over and the river itself would be hidden in a collector and be no obstacle whatsoever to enemy tanks.' Before Soviet occupation, says Bohdan Prots of the National Museum of Natural History and CEO of the Danube-Carpathian Programme, the Irpin floodplain was a biodiversity hotspot, a kind of Ukrainian Amazon, with vast wetlands composed of bogs, swamps and marshes that thrived along riverbanks of thick reed beds and dunes of golden sand. 'It was 5 metres deep in places, and full of giant catfish and sturgeon, as well as now-missing wetland bird species and birds of prey, like the white-tailed eagle.' According to Prots, Soviet dams on the Irpin and Dnipro had a catastrophic impact on the ecosystems of the Irpin and its many tributaries that once thrived here. Many housing developments were built on the old floodplain, putting further pressure on the dying river ecosystem. 'Wetlands can't be restored just like that,' says Prots. 'They [the Soviets] created huge environmental problems by damming and adding locks to the Irpin, which over the years steadily reduced the volume and flow velocity of water, which encouraged excessive algae that in turn reduced water oxygenation to the point where big fish could no longer breathe. 'Just because the water has returned it doesn't mean we are looking at a new wetland rich in biodiversity. The ecology has been very badly degraded over many, many years. It would need many years for ecological improvements to be observed,' he adds. The sudden re-flooding of the old Kyiv-Irpin wetlands, which was also used as a first defence by Ukrainians defending Kyiv against the Germans in 1941, is very unlikely to have the kind of ecological benefits a carefully managed rewilding project would produce, he says. 'War doesn't do rewilding - there was no research, there was no planning or mitigation. It might have helped us defend our capital, but before long there will be pressure to redrain this area. Can you imagine how many trillions of mosquitoes will be here this summer?' Prots says he thinks the local government will come under pressure to rebuild the Irpin dam. But while the war is still raging and the Kyiv region still littered with mines, it could be some time before any attempt could begin. 'I think there's a good chance it [the dam] will be rebuilt eventually, but right now all our energies and thoughts are on defeating the invaders, because this is an existential issue for us. Until it is resolved and the Russians are kicked out of our lands, we can't properly address this issue.' Alexey Vasilyuk, biologist and founder and chairman of the Ukrainian Nature Conservation Group (UNCG), says he is hopeful the reflooded Irpin wetlands will remain. 'First of all, these waters are now serving in the defence of Kyiv, so until we are sure Russia won't try to seize Kyiv again, I don't see how we can justify completely draining this area again. Secondly, I think it will be extremely difficult or maybe impossible to reverse what has happened. 'Hypothetically speaking, it might become a very good spawning ground for fish that have dramatically declined here over the last decades, and also become an important breeding ground for many species of rare wetland birds,' he says. But, says Vasilyuk, the return of the water could pose as many problems as opportunities. 'The local ecosystem of the Irpin River basin was in a bad way before the dam burst,' he says. 'And now, a lot of Russian tanks and military equipment are underwater here. The mixing of chemicals and oils from fuel tanks with pollution from inundated landfills is a big threat,' he says. 'Right before the war, many parts of the land were sprayed with pesticides and fertilisers, so there are many threats for humans and wildlife that should be resolved.' Despite the hazards and dangers, Vasilyuk remains optimistic that solutions can be found, and that Kyiv's ancient wetlands may be back for good. 'While the soldiers of the Ukrainian armed forces are fighting to stop the genocide of the Ukrainian people, we think that the environmental front should take care to prevent ecocide,' says Vasilyuk. 'This is possibly the most precious and important wetland in Ukraine, not because of its fragile or unique biodiversity, but because without this swampy barrier, the battle for Kyiv might have had a very different outcome.'

They became war correspondents overnight. Ukrainian journalists were spotlighted this week when the Pulitzer prize board awarded them with a special citation, hailing the country's reporters for the 'courage, endurance and commitment to truthful reporting' they have shown since the Russian invasion. But initially, writing stories and making television reports was secondary for the reporters, editors, and producers who heard explosions around them and scrambled for safety. For more than a month many Ukrainian journalists focused on survival. Some have since returned to work, but often they lack protective equipment and hostile environment training. 'Lots of journalists left Kyiv,' said Kristina Berdynskykh, a journalist at one of Ukraine's major independent publications, Novoye Vremya. 'They weren't thinking about whether they'd be fired, they were just thinking that they had to get their families out.' After the first few days almost all of the staff of Ukraine's prominent newsrooms fled westwards to Lviv where many remain. Lviv quickly became the new temporary capital when Russian forces surrounded Kyiv. 'From the print journalists I know, there was maybe a handful left in Kyiv,' said Berdynskykh. 'It is mostly the TV stations who had small teams of war correspondents who had experience in the Donbas. For everyone else, the situation was an absolute shock.' Those who stayed in Ukraine's hotspots embarked on new careers. Berdynskykh spent 18 nights sleeping on the floor in Kyiv's metro to avoid the shelling and conducted phone interviews. Without a car or taxis, and with shells flying into the city, in-person interviews were near to impossible for the first month she said. 'At first it was practically just western journalists - war correspondents - doing on-the-ground reporting,' said Berdynskykh, who was a leading political reporter but is now focusing on the experiences of ordinary Ukrainians around the country. 'But I'm grateful to them because we were still adapting.' Original reporting has since returned to Ukraine's news sites but most newsrooms cannot afford to simultaneously provide their staff with protective equipment and pay salaries, said Katerina Sergatskova, who founded 24.02 Fund, whose aim is to raise money to help equip reporters and newsrooms with the necessary equipment. The income from online advertising which many Ukrainian news sites relied on dried up when the economy shut down. The demand for protective equipment from Ukrainian journalists has increased as journalists return to work, said Sergatskova. After a month of searching for suppliers, amid a worldwide shortage of bulletproof vests, the 24.02 Fund has now sourced 150 vests and helmets as well as first aid kits and it is working with other organisations to provide first aid training to journalists. Sergatskova, who is a managing editor of Zaborona, another independent Ukrainian publication, fled Kyiv on the seventh day of the war to evacuate her two small children. 'When we saw a Russian plane being shot down from our [apartment's] window, we decided we had to get out,' said Sergatskova. 'At first, we took the children to Lviv and then rockets started to hit there, so we took them to live with friends in Europe. Now we can work knowing that they're safe.' Others, such as Kirill Gonchar in Ukraine's eastern city of Kharkiv, found themselves even more in the deep end. Gonchar was a creative director of a production company, who shot commercials and promotional videos for newsrooms and businesses before the war. Russian bombs devastated Kharkiv in the first few weeks of the war and the city is still shelled several times a day. When Gonchar realised that Kharkiv's journalists had either left or could not leave their basements, he ventured out into the city's streets under shelling to start filming. He said he was almost the only person working on the ground and was soon sending his footage to the BBC, the Associated Press, CNN and others. 'I just felt I had to act and this was something I could do,' said Gonchar. 'At first I thought I'd make a documentary but then I realised that I just needed to just do news so I could share what was happening.' Gonchar said he started looking for a vest and helmet and writing to people after the first week. But it was only after five weeks of working on the ground that some of his former employers managed to source a vest and helmet for him. Asked how he felt about working without equipment, he said that in some ways he did not know any different. When international journalists started arriving in Kharkiv in late March with full kit, it started to figure more heavily on his mind. 'There were several times when I was almost hit,' he said. 'One of the houses that my friends and I moved into because it had a basement was completely destroyed by a rocket a week after I moved out. 'Those who were in the basement survived,' said Gonchar, whose friends were seriously injured in the attack. 'But I can't say I was scared [to work] because I knew other people had it worse than me.' Since 24 February, at least seven journalists have been killed while working in the field and dozens have been injured, according to Ukraine's Institute of Mass Information, a media development organisation.", "9c922eb59d986e26ea624fddcc3f18de4207e5eef7a7e8cc37867f57": "North Korea has declared a 'severe national emergency' after confirming its first outbreak of Covid-19, prompting its leader, Kim Jong-un, to vow to quickly eliminate the virus. State media reported on Thursday that a sub-variant of the highly transmissible Omicron virus, known as BA.2, had been detected in the capital, Pyongyang. 'There has been the biggest emergency incident in the country, with a hole in our emergency quarantine front, that has been kept safely over the past two years and three months since February 2020,' the official KCNA news agency said. The report said people in Pyongyang had contracted the Omicron variant, without providing details on case numbers or possible sources of infection. North Korea had claimed it had not recorded a single case of Covid-19 since it closed its borders at the start of the pandemic more than two years ago. The discovery of the Omicron variant presents a potentially serious risk to North Korea, which has not vaccinated any of its 25 million people, according to experts, and its poorly resourced healthcare system would also struggle to cope with a major outbreak. The country so far has shunned vaccines offered by the UN-backed Covax distribution programme, possibly because administering the jabs would require international monitoring. The Seoul-based NK News reported that areas of Pyongyang had been in lockdown for two days. 'Multiple sources have also heard reports of panic buying due to uncertainty of when the lockdown might end,' it said, citing sources in the city. The KCNA report said samples taken from patients in Pyongyang who had developed fevers were 'consistent with' the Omicron variant. The discovery prompted Kim to call a crisis meeting of the Workers' party politburo, where officials said they would implement 'maximum' emergency measures. They reportedly include tighter border controls and lockdown measures, with Kim telling citizens 'to completely block the spread of the malicious virus by thoroughly blocking their areas in all cities and counties across the country'. All business and production activities will be organised so each work unit is 'isolated' to prevent the spread of disease, KCNA said. Kim told the meeting that 'the goal was to eliminate the root within the shortest period of time', it added. Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, said the regime's public acknowledgment of coronavirus cases meant 'the public health situation must be serious'. 'This does not mean North Korea is suddenly going to be open to humanitarian assistance and take a more conciliatory line toward Washington and Seoul,' he said. Easley said the presence of the virus could affect any plans the leadership has for missile or nuclear tests. 'The Kim regime's domestic audience may be less interested in nuclear or missile tests when the urgent threat involves coronavirus rather than a foreign military,' he said. 'The Kim regime would be well advised to swallow its pride and quickly seek donations of vaccines and therapeutics.' North Korea closed its borders to nearly all trade and visitors at the start of the pandemic, inflicting more pain on an economy already damaged by decades of mismanagement and international sanctions over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes. It tentatively reopened railroad freight traffic with China in January, but Chinese authorities halted trade last month after a Covid-19 outbreak in Dandong, a city close to the border with North Korea.", "ecbd3094d9f65c2b6a1b9a85ecd3d12ad0334e7fbfb75503d738f1f7": "The US Senate on Wednesday failed to advance legislation that would codify the right to an abortion into federal law, after it was blocked by Republicans. It was a largely symbolic vote by Democrats to mobilize Americans around the issue ahead of a likely supreme court decision striking down the protections enshrined by Roe v Wade. The Senate roll call was a stark reflection of the partisan divide over abortion rights, with all Republicans and one conservative Democrat, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, voting against the measure. The final tally was 49-51, well short of the 60 votes necessary to overcome a filibuster in the Senate. 'Sadly the Senate failed to stand in defense of a woman's right to make decisions about her own body,' Kamala Harris, the first woman and woman of color to serve as vice-president, told reporters outside of the Senate chamber, where she presided over the doomed vote. Pointing to the onslaught of laws restricting abortion access in Republican-led states, Harris said that 'the priority should be to elect pro-choice leaders at the local, the state and the federal level'. Joe Biden, who has called on the Democratic-controlled Congress to protect abortion rights, blamed Republicans, saying they 'have chosen to stand in the way of Americans' rights to make the most personal decisions about their own bodies, families and lives'. The president vowed to sign any bill that would secure reproductive rights and pledged to explore ways his administration could act in lieu of Congress. Democrats moved quickly to stage the vote after a leak last week of a draft opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito in February and confirmed as authentic, indicated that the court's conservative majority had privately voted to strike down Roe and subsequent rulings. The extraordinary disclosure ignited protests around the country, pushing reproductive rights to the center of the political debate six months before the congressional midterms. A final ruling from the court is expected this summer. Ahead of the vote, a group of House Democratic women marched across the Capitol to protest against the end of Roe, chanting: 'My body, my decision.' Democrats, under intensifying pressure to act, saw a political opportunity in forcing Republicans to vote against a bill protecting abortion at a moment when the threat to access is urgent and polls show a majority of Americans want the procedure to remain legal in all or some cases. They hope to use the Republican blockade as a data point in their midterm message to voters: that the GOP has become a party of 'ultra-Maga' extremists, on the cusp of fulfilling a decades-long goal to strip women of their reproductive rights. It is an issue Democrats hope will energize young voters disenchanted by the Biden administration and persuade Republican-leaning suburban women to back them again this cycle. The Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, urging support for the measure, warned that a failure to protect abortion access would put at risk other individual rights like contraception and same-sex marriage. 'If we do not take a stand now to protect a woman's right to choose, then mark my words, it will be open season, open season on our God-given freedoms,' Schumer said in a floor speech ahead of a vote that he called 'one of the most consequential we will take in decades'. If passed, the bill would have codified Roe v Wade into federal law, ensuring the right of healthcare providers to perform abortions and the right of patients to receive them. But it would also go further, in some cases invalidating state-level restrictions on abortion access enacted after the Roe decision in 1973. As such, Republicans cast the bill as a 'radical' attempt to expand reproductive rights that goes far beyond Roe and would legalize 'abortion on demand'. 'We will stand with the American people, stand with innocent life, and block the Democrats' extreme bill,' the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, said on Wednesday. Republicans are betting the economy will take precedence over abortion this November. Polling shows Republicans are well positioned to make significant gains in the midterm elections, buoyed by historical headwinds, discontent with the party in power and widespread concern over the rising cost of gas, food and rent. But there are signs that Republicans do worry about a potential political backlash if Roe is overturned and states move swiftly to outlaw abortion, as many are preparing to do. A day ahead of the vote, McConnell, who effectively secured a conservative super-majority on the supreme court, sought to downplay calls for a nationwide ban on abortion if they take control of the chamber in November, telling reporters: 'Historically, there have been abortion votes on the floor of the Senate. None of them have achieved 60 votes.' The two Senate Republicans who support abortion rights, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, opposed the bill, instead urging support for an alternative measure that they say is tailored to reflect the landscape of abortion rights. But many Democrats see their proposal, which is not expected to receive a vote, as too weak. 'Unlike some far-left activists, Senator Murkowski and I want the law today to be the law tomorrow,' Collins said on Wednesday, objecting to the lack of protections for religious exemptions in the Democrats' bill. In a dramatic shift, one of the only other Democrats in Congress with conservative views on abortion rights, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, said he would support the measure and voted in favor of advancing it. In a statement citing the leaked supreme court ruling, Casey said the 'circumstances around the entire debate on abortion' had changed since the last time the Senate voted on the measure. Abortion is also likely to be a major issue in races for governor and state offices, as the battle lines shift to the states, where Democrats are racing to secure and expand abortion access and Republicans are working to limit, or in some cases, outlaw it. The show vote on Wednesday only intensified calls from progressives for Democrats to eliminate the filibuster or carve out an exception for abortion rights. But at this point, there are not 60 votes to codify Roe, and there is not enough Democratic support to eliminate or amend the Senate filibuster. Without a clear legislative path forward, Democrats are turning to the fall elections, urging Americans to elect them as the 'last lines of defense' against the end of Roe. 'I am angry and I'm disappointed,' Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington and a long-time advocate of reproductive rights, said after Wednesday's vote. She urged Americans concerned over the threat to abortion to not lose hope. 'Now is not the time to back down or sit down,' she said. 'Now is the time to lift up our voices and fight back. And that's exactly what we're going to do.'", "7bc3dc8f9e86acf97bc44f6f53985d7253d3991d8af507aaef73bd2f": "Trevor Foster, 26, loved the Cowboys, the Yankees, fishing, animals and above all his daughter. Jarod Galloway, 21, wanted people to be the best version of themselves, and his niece was his favorite human. Taylor Miller, 27, was a nursing student and a staunch supporter of anyone in recovery. Michael Stabile, 15, was ending his freshman year with great grades and a promotion at the restaurant where he worked. Jared Tyler Olvera, 20, always befriended the new kids at school. Jordan Humphrey, 21, loved sneakers, cars and his family, who loved him 'as big as the sky'. All were among US overdose deaths in 2021, a record year for such fatalities with an estimated 107,622, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Wednesday. It was an increase of 15% from the previous year, which was also a record. The US has now passed 1m overdose deaths since the CDC began collecting data about two decades ago. The surge in deaths in 2021 was fueled primarily by fentanyl, a highly dangerous synthetic opioid that accounted for about 70% of fatalities. Black American men and boys have the highest fatality rates from drug overdoses, followed closely by American Indian and Alaska Native men and boys - a significant increase among these demographics in recent years. Overdose deaths among teens have doubled in the past three years, even though drug use is decreasing overall among teens. Teens are more likely to buy pills they think are Adderall, Xanax or Percocet, seeking help in studying for exams, calming anxiety, helping sleep, or treating pain, said Dr Nora D Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (Nida) at the National Institutes of Health. 'They've been doing this for decades. What is now different is these prescription drugs that are illicitly manufactured containing fentanyl have increased fiftyfold,' Volkow said. The almost fiftyfold increase in illicit pills containing fentanyl happened between 2018 and 2021, she said - a 'huge proliferation'. One-time and casual users, including children, are dying. 'They were poisoned by taking a pill that contains something that they did not know was there,' Volkow said. Cameron March, 23, was a Sacramento Kings basketball fan, one of 10 children in a bustling blended family. From a friend, he bought two pills he thought were Percocet. He had struggled with anxiety and depression since middle school and he had bought pills before. This time, the pills, pressed to look like real prescription medication, contained twice the lethal dose of fentanyl. On 11 August 2021, March never woke up. 'He didn't really know how it's everywhere,' said his mother, Lisa Ezell. 'He just didn't know. 'It's completely devastating. That one missing person is just so glaringly obvious - his presence is so greatly missed.' Cameron's older siblings are stricken with grief and his younger siblings can't comprehend why someone would 'put poison in a pill and give it to him', his mother said. Volkow said: 'We as a nation have to say, 'What is it that we can do to avoid that [increase in deaths] happening again?' What is it that we're doing wrong?' Drug overdoses are particularly tragic because they are entirely preventable, Volkow said. Opioid overdoses can be reversed with naloxone. Schools and parents, Volkow said, need to reach out to kids to educate them on the dangers of fentanyl, and medical providers can screen for drug use in teenagers or the presence of an underlying mental disorder, like anxiety or depression. Offering social support can also make a huge difference. 'Isolation, feeling that actually nobody cares for you, is one of the factors that increases risk - that you don't have alternatives in your life, that you're not doing well at school, that you feel very, very depressed and nobody seems to care,' Volkow said. 'This is a disease of distress. So what are the support systems that we need to provide to people to contain this very dangerous use of drugs?' Harm reduction is also an important part of stemming the tide of deaths, Volkow said. That includes the widespread distribution of naloxone, which is extremely easy to use in the inhalable form known as Narcan. 'It's a no-brainer,' Volkow said. Offering substance use treatment options, distributing test strips to detect the presence of fentanyl, offering needle exchanges and safe injection sites, and ensuring a safe, uncontaminated supply of substances for those who continue using are also important steps for addressing the epidemic of overdose deaths. Many of those who die from overdoses are young, Volkow said. 'They are in the most productive years of their life. Many of them have families and children, and all of them are left behind.' Overdose can strike anyone, even the first time they take a contaminated pill. 'It's not a drug addict problem,' Lisa Ezell said. 'It could be a one-time thing at a party, or your kid has a toothache or a back problem and they get a pill from a friend.' She wants officials to hold people accountable, and to do everything they can to spread the word about the epidemic sweeping the US. 'There's so many people dying and nothing's being done,' she said.", "0f31fdd3e1093c485ad15c4c6188e11258e2a39d0fd6a5ff193cd5fb": "Papua New Guinea's deputy prime minister, Sam Basil, has died after a car crash, police have said. Basil died in hospital while awaiting airlift to Port Moresby late on Wednesday after the crash, which took place in the Wau-Bulolo region, Morobe province. 'Local police attended to the accident site and immediately retrieved the deputy prime minister and three other injured persons and transported them to Bulolo to seek medical attention at the Bulolo Health facility,' said David Manning, the police commissioner, in a statement. 'After hours of attempting to revive him Mr Basil succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced clinically dead at 11:30 pm last night.' Police later confirmed that a close protection officer travelling with Basil had also died. Police launched an investigation into the accident and the second vehicle involved. The driver of that vehicle 'was known', Manning said, adding: 'I appeal to any eyewitnesses to the incident to come forward to assist investigators in their investigations.' Basil, the leader of the United Labour party, is the eighth MP to have died in this parliamentary term.

The case sparked nationwide outrage in the EU country where Catholic church-backed conservative groups aspire to curb the right to abortion, which is legal until the 10th week of pregnancy. After that period, it can be performed if the health of the mother or foetus is seriously jeopardised, as well as in cases of rape or incest. But abortion is becoming more restricted as rising religious pressure sways doctors to refuse it on moral grounds. Mirela Cavajda's foetus was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour in late April, in the sixth month of pregnancy. Doctors told the 39-year-old, who already has one child, that the foetus would - if born - either die or have serious defects, she told local media. They advised Cavajda to seek help in neighbouring Slovenia. Meanwhile, four public hospitals in the Croatian capital, Zagreb, refused to carry out the abortion without explanation or after saying they could not confirm the diagnosis or lacked the necessary conditions. But Croatian health minister Vili Beros said on Wednesday that a medical 'commission allowed the termination of [Cavajda's] pregnancy'. 'The situation is extremely difficult,' as the MRI scan of her foetus's brain showed, he told reporters. That is why the commission estimated that 'both medical and legal preconditions for the approval of abortion have been met', he said. The case angered members of rights groups and many other people in the Balkan country. On Thursday, rallies in support of Cavajda are due to be held in Zagreb and several other cities. Nearly 90% of Croatia's population of 3.9 million are Roman Catholic and the church remains immensely influential. In 2017, the country's top court rejected calls from church-backed conservatives for a ban on abortion. It also ordered the parliament to adopt a new law on abortion regulations and ruled that the current one, dating back to the 1970s, was outdated.", "d08ac02307f9d7a389b7bbb1c23e0c75df4bc64f119e368e5f3a608a": "A police crackdown in Vanuatu that has seen people arrested for allegedly posting comments on social media speculating politicians were responsible for the country's current Covid outbreak has raised serious concerns about freedom of speech in the Pacific country. At least four people on two separate islands have been arrested as part of a major investigation by Vanuatu's Serious Crime Unit in the last few weeks, including a factory worker, a printer, a business owner, and a Facebook page moderator. They face charges of cyber stalking, cyber slander, and cyber libel and face up to three years in prison and fines of up to three million Vatu (US$25,838). The charges relate to alleged comments on Facebook claiming that two politicians in the country had breached Covid quarantine protocols, one of which had played a role in the community transmission of the virus. These are the first arrests under Vanuatu's new cybercrime legislation passed into law last year. Australia has been working with Vanuatu to bolster its cybersecurity capability as part of its overall diplomatic efforts to combat China's rising influence in the region. According to the explanatory note introducing the legislation , the government said the act was to combat cybercrime, which it called 'a global phenomenon that poses threats to Vanuatu's national infrastructure, public service delivery, commercial and financial security.' Vanuatu's Opposition leader Ralph Regenvanu has accused the government of using the laws for political ends. 'What is happening now is that the government and the police are using the excuse of the lockdown restrictions being lifted to basically just try and clamp down on dissent, on anyone having any different views.' Andrea Woi, 38, a single mother and factory processor, is one of those charged with criminal slander and cyber stalking. Investigators flew from the capital of Port Vila to the northern island of Santo, where she lives, and came to her workplace on 26 April to arrest her. She was taken from to the police station in Luganville and told she was facing serious charges which could result in three years' imprisonment, and a fine of up to three million Vatu. 'Three police officers came to my workplace and asked for me. I heard one police officer say to the other that I was a suspect. They told me my case was very serious and that I could go to jail for three years. I was very scared,' said Woi. She is accused of making a comment on a Facebook post insinuating an MP - Anthony Iauko - had breached quarantine, something he denies. Woi has since been told she must fly to Port Vila to answer the charges this month. Her family has had to talk her out of resigning her job in shame. Witnol Benkor Tor, a Facebook moderator of a news site known as Vanuatu Politics and News, was one of the first to be charged under the police crackdown. He has been charged with cyber libel, cyber slander and cyber stalking and also faces up to three years' imprisonment and a fine of up to three million Vatu. He was charged after someone posted on his Facebook page under a pseudonym, making allegations that Iauko breached Covid rules to visit someone in quarantine. Tor says he does not know who wrote the post. 'I am worried about what this means for freedom of speech,' said Tor. 'I posted nothing wrong myself. I am simply one of the moderators of a page. When I set up the Vanuatu News and Politics page, I invited people from both sides of politics to help moderate it in the interests of balance.' The Facebook page has since been taken down, though not by Tor. The Guardian has confirmed four people have been charged in the crackdown, but Tor believes there are many others too. He said when he was taken to the police station there was a long list of names on the wall of people the Serious Crimes Unit was investigating. Prior to the arrests, the government used a regular Covid briefing which was broadcast live on Facebook to outline charges of cyber libel, cyber slander and cyberstalking that now exist under the new legislation. Vanuatu police were contacted for comment. The crackdown was initiated following the discovery of the first case of the virus in the community earlier this year, signalling that Vanuatu's days as a Covid-free nation were over. Vanuatu was one of the last countries in the world to experience the impact of community transmission from the coronavirus pandemic, only recording cases among returning citizens or visa holders, who were isolated and successfully treated in quarantine before being allowed to return home. However, in March, the virus spread to the community and health authorities issued a statement saying the transmission must have resulted from a breach of quarantine.  On 5 March, Anthony Iauko, a government MP, presented at the country's main hospital feeling unwell and tested positive for the virus. The opposition leader Ralph Regenvanu issued a statement on 8 March alleging that Iauko unlawfully entered quarantine several times and also that he took people out of quarantine to socialise with him. Iauko has denied these claims and says he contracted Covid when he visited the hospital. There was widespread speculation in media and on social media in Vanuatu that Iauko was 'Case Zero' - the case that started community transmission. Health officials have confirmed to the Guardian that Iauko was the first reported locally acquired Covid case in the country. When contacted by the Guardian, Iauko declined to comment and said to 'contact my lawyer', but did not provide the lawyer's name or phone number. Regenvanu lodged a complaint with police against Iauko in March for allegedly breaching the Public Health Act. Vanuatu's police chief has confirmed the investigation into Iauko has been dropped. Regenvanu also made allegations against the country's deputy prime minister Ishmael Alatoi Kalsakau, accusing him of leaving quarantine before the end of a seven day quarantine extension without gaining official clearance. Kalsakau did complete the initial 14 days in quarantine. He is not accused of spreading the virus as a result of the alleged breach. 'The DPM (deputy prime minister) came on a New Zealand flight on 20 February with 19 passengers who were later tested positive. The protocol is to extend the quarantine of all passengers on the same flight for a further seven days,' Regenvanu said in his statement. 'He was home by last Sunday afternoon while his fellow passengers remain in [extended] quarantine in accordance with the law.' Kalsakau told local media he received authorisation to leave after 14 days and tested negative three times before leaving quarantine. He also said that he asked the Ministry of Health if there was anything preventing him from leaving quarantine after 14 days and did not receive a response. Regenvanu has submitted a request under freedom of information laws to receive a copy of the recommendation from a medical officer that Kalsakau could be discharged from a quarantine facility. Kalsakau was contacted for comment. Thirteen people have died since the Omicron strain was detected in Vanuatu in March. The virus has now spread to five of the country's six provinces. There have been almost 7,000 confirmed cases in Vanuatu since the beginning of the year.", "4382a964327d7803e765cfd6218f23ee71f9ecce25b8e83c94b6e7eb": "Lufthansa has apologised for refusing to let any members of a large group of Orthodox Jewish passengers on to a flight after some of them had refused to wear masks. The German airline said in a statement that it 'regrets the circumstances surrounding the decision to exclude the affected passengers from the flight, for which Lufthansa sincerely apologises'. The airline said it was reviewing what had happened during the incident on 4 May, involving passengers from New York transiting in Frankfurt for a flight to Budapest. Some of the passengers had allegedly refused to comply with rules requiring them to wear face masks, whereupon Lufthansa staff allegedly blocked all passengers who were visibly identifiable as Jewish from boarding their connecting flight, German daily Frankfurter Allgemeiner Zeitung reported. Local German media reported that the staff excluded those passengers who were recognisable as being Jewish because they were wearing skull caps or had sidelocks. 'We regret that the large group was denied boarding rather than limiting it to the non-compliant guests,' the airline said. 'We have zero tolerance for racism, antisemitism and discrimination of any type,' it added. Uwe Becker, the antisemitism commissioner of the state of Hesse, where Frankfurt is located, sharply condemned the incident. Becker said that apparently an entire group of people - solely because of their recognisable faith - had been held responsible for something that obviously only affected individual travellers. 'This is discriminatory and not a trivial matter, and all the more reason why the company's top management should also feel personally responsible for apologising for this incident and taking a clear and unequivocal stand,' Becker told the German news agency dpa. Becker said he would be happy to have a conversation with Lufthansa on the matter.

The findings from the small study indicate that it could be time to reconsider how pain is treated. Normal recovery from a painful injury involves inflammation - the body's natural reaction to injury and infection - and new research suggests blocking inflammation with drugs could lead to harder-to-treat issues. It may be that inflammation has a protective effect, such as preventing acute pain from becoming chronic, and that overly reducing it may be harmful. Jeffrey Mogil, a professor of pain studies at McGill University in Canada, said: 'While ibuprofen was not studied explicitly in either the human or the mouse data (in the mouse we used diclofenac), as ibuprofen is so common in the UK, it is highly likely that a large percentage of those in the UK Biobank who reported taking 'NSAIDs' (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) were in fact taking ibuprofen.' Researchers said lower-back pain was the most commonly reported form of chronic pain - pain that persists for longer than would be expected after the injury - and resulted in massive economic and medical costs each year. Most patients receive standard treatments such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen and corticosteroids. But these drugs are only somewhat effective, and little is known about why acute pain, which begins suddenly in response to something specific, is resolved in some patients but persists as chronic pain in others. To understand the transition from acute to chronic lower-back pain, researchers followed 98 patients with acute lower-back pain for three months. They also examined the mechanisms of pain in both humans and mice, and found that neutrophils - a type of white blood cell that helps the body fight infection - play a key role in resolving pain. Blocking these cells in mice prolonged the pain for up to 10 times the normal duration. Treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs and steroids such as dexamethasone and diclofenac also produced the same result, although they were effective against pain early on. Researchers said the findings were supported by a separate analysis of 500,000 people in the UK Biobank study, which showed that those taking anti-inflammatory drugs were more likely to have pain two to 10 years later. This effect was not seen in people taking paracetamol or antidepressants. Dr Franziska Denk, senior lecturer at King's College London, said: 'It would most definitely be premature to make any recommendations regarding people's medication until we have results of a prospectively designed clinical trial.' Prof Blair Smith, from the University of Dundee, said: 'The theory is that inflammation may have a protective effect in the long-term, and that overly reducing inflammation may be harmful. 'However, it is important to note that this is just one study, and more research is needed to confirm and investigate this further.' The findings are published in Science Translational Medicine.", "e8511e278cd776c3e3b912c6b0cbbc8fc81ab1a93f52ef511d78e347": "Rebekah Vardy has denied being willing to lie under oath in the 'Wagatha Christie' libel trial, as she admitted allowing her agent to access Coleen Rooney's private Instagram posts. Giving evidence on Wednesday, the second day of the trial, Vardy also accepted she had attempted to leak a story about the arrest of Premier League footballer Danny Drinkwater to the Sun - accompanied by the note: 'I want paying for this x.' Vardy told the high court this leak was a one-off incident motivated by the desire to expose a drink-driver. She also insisted that multiple other WhatsApp conversations with her agent, Caroline Watt, concerning leaking stories to the Sun about other celebrities - including Rooney, model Danielle Lloyd and unnamed footballers - were jokes that should not be taken seriously. In response, Rooney's barrister, David Sherborne, said this was 'completely untrue', and it was impossible to believe Vardy and Watt were just joking about selling stories to the Sun. He also claimed there were discrepancies between Vardy's written witness statement and her spoken evidence in court. 'What this shows, Mrs Vardy, is that you are prepared to lie under oath,' he said. Vardy replied: 'No.' Sherborne alleged there was an established pattern of behaviour, where Vardy passed story tips to Watt, who then gave them to journalists at the Sun. He told Vardy: 'It's not that you didn't want to do the dirty, it's that you didn't want to be seen to be doing the dirty.' The court also heard how Vardy - the wife of Leicester City footballer Jamie Vardy - shared her Instagram account with Watt. This enabled her agent to view posts on Rooney's locked private Instagram account, which had only about 300 trusted followers. Rooney's legal team allege Vardy and Watt worked together to pass these private Instagram updates to journalists at the Sun. Sherborne said it was 'quite clear' Watt was monitoring Rooney's private Instagram posts using Vardy's account, and the duo would sometimes discuss Rooney's Instagram updates on WhatsApp. 'You knew what she was doing and you condoned it,' he told Vardy. 'No that's not true,' she replied. At one point the court heard that Rooney had briefly blocked Vardy from the private Instagram. Watt sent a WhatsApp to Vardy, asking: 'Babe, has Coleen unfollowed you?' Vardy replied: 'Oh wow I just saw, wow, what a cunt. I'm going to message her.' Sherborne told the court that it was difficult to know for certain if Watt had sent messages to journalists because Watt's phone - which he wished to search - had fallen off the side of a boat off the Scottish coast. 'We will never know because her phone sits at the bottom of the North Sea,' he told the court. The disclosures were made as part of the libel case Vardy is bringing against Rooney, after Rooney alleged Vardy leaked stories from the private Instagram account to the Sun. Rooney - the wife of Derby County manager Wayne - went public with the accusation in October 2019, claiming to have run a sting operation to find the leaker and concluding: 'It's .......... Rebekah Vardy's account.' Vardy has always maintained the accusation is false and defamatory, and she has brought the libel case in a bid to clear her name. Late in the afternoon, Vardy - who spent the entire day in the witness box - dabbed at her eyes when questioned about the abuse she and her family have received while in the public eye. The proceedings were watched intently by Rooney and her husband, both of whom are expected to later give evidence in the trial. The court also heard accusations that Vardy leaked private information about her husband's then-teammate Riyad Mahrez to the media in 2018, potentially destabilising the players' club, Leicester City. In messages shown to the court, Vardy told her agent: 'Mahrez not turned up to training again, the lads are fuming.' Watt suggested contacting a Sky Sports reporter but Vardy replied: 'I just don't want it coming back on me.' Watt then said 'I can tell someone,' to which Vardy replied: 'Yes, do it.' Sherborne pressed Vardy on whether her husband was the source of the messages about Mahrez: 'Did you or did you not know that the lads were fuming?' Vardy insisted she was just gossiping and did not have a source in the Leicester City changing room. 'Jamie and I never discussed whether the lads were fuming,' she said. The footballer's wife told the high court she did not systematically leak stories to the media and the idea of seeking payment from the Sun for the story about Drinkwater crashing his car was a 'fleeting thought'. She said her real motivation in wanting to leak the story was to expose a drink-driver to public scrutiny. When told by Watt the Sun had already learned about the arrest from a source at the police station, Vardy said she was 'fuming I didn't give it to you earlier'. Watt replied to say 'that would have been a fortune ' and instead suggested finding out where Drinkwater lived and sharing the information with the paparazzi agency Splash News. Vardy's evidence is set to continue on Thursday after it was cut short by a fire alarm.

Sherry Noppe, 63, left her home in Houston, Texas last week, to take her black labrador, Max, for a stroll. The pair never returned. For three days, authorities and volunteers searched for Noppe, who had recently been diagnosed with dementia. They eventually found her next to three-year old Max in George Bush Park, an 8,000-acre expanse next to her home. According to a family friend, Michael England, who joined search efforts, Noppe was found several hundred yards into the park. 'As they got closer to her, I think that's what caused him to bark because he was protecting her,' Sherry Noppe's brother, Justin Noppe, told KHOU. 'So I do think his barking is what led those people to hear him and go in that area and find her. So yes, I do believe he saved her life. 'When they actually found her, they heard him growling and barking.' In a police statement, Constable Ted Heap of Harris county precinct 5, said Sherry Noppe 'was located at approximately 3am on Friday by a group of tireless volunteers and deputies who were alerted by the sound of her dog, Max, barking in the woods'. Aside from a few minor cuts and bruises, Noppe was not injured. She was admitted to hospital with dehydration and was given fluids.

Divers have now pulled out more than 25,000 pounds of debris from the 72 miles of the lake's shoreline, working in a circle from Stateline, Nevada. As volunteer divers navigated the lake, they plucked plastic bottles, engagement rings, 1980s Nikon film cameras, entire lampposts, 'no littering' signs, big pieces of broken-down boats and engine blocks, lost wallets and cordless home telephones, according to Clean Up the Lake. The founder and executive director of the group, Colin West, said he organized a beach cleanup in 2018, when volunteers recovered 40lb of litter from the shoreline near the popular King's Beach. He chatted with some friends who were doing an underwater cleanup and they had recovered 600lbs of litter from beneath the surface. A light went off for him, West says: 'How did all that litter make it under the surface of such a beautiful lake?' His team of volunteers started doing surveys, and they found more than 50lbs of trash a diver each time they went out. They later launched the 72 Mile project to clean up the lake. The divers are supported by boats and jet skis. On any given day, the non-profit organizes 10 people on the water. They have completed 189 dives in 81 days. Lake Tahoe is more than 1,600ft deep in some parts. Pollution from algae and fine sediments have muddied the lake's famously clear blue waters. The lake's clarity declined 30%, from 100 ft to 64 ft, between 1968 and 1997, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. As the climate gets hotter and less rain falls, the lake may also be threatened in unique ways: its waters warmed 15 times faster recently than the average rate over the previous century. Picking up trash will not affect these more systemic issues, but it does make people think more about the ecology of the area, the group says. The divers didn't go deeper than 25 ft to retrieve items, though they geotagged bulkier, deeper trash for later removal. When looking at the litter - including anchors, tires and ropes - it's easy to feel like people are making bad decisions, West said. But the majority of debris is accidental litter that has wound up there through normal human activities. 'You might find five or six beer cans in one area,' he said. 'But the sunglasses, the cellphones, the hats, the construction material - a lot of this has happened accidentally or from wind storms. No one is trying to lose a boat anchor.' Some of the garbage will be used to create a new art installation at a nearby events center. In the future, the project plans to expand to three other lakes, including June Lake in the Mammoth Lakes region and Fallen Leaf Lake in the Tahoe basin. Divers will also be collecting data on invasive species and algae blooms while in the water. They also want to monitor the situation after the cleanup to determine if it has changed for the better, or if it is back to the junk. West wants to see increased litter prevention signs, trash receptacles, and education. 'We are all part of the problem - whether you are on a boat or building a house,' says West. 'So we need to be part of the solution as well.'", "d9e3c8a3eca67a08b0c1efc453d132f8025ae34dcf73d1d36af33e35": "Coral bleaching affected 91% of reefs surveyed along the Great Barrier Reef this year, according to a report by government scientists that confirms the natural landmark has suffered its sixth mass bleaching event on record. The Reef snapshot: summer 2021-22, quietly published by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority on Tuesday night after weeks of delay, said above-average water temperatures in late summer had caused coral bleaching throughout the 2,300km reef system, but particularly in the central region between Cape Tribulation and the Whitsundays. 'The surveys confirm a mass bleaching event, with coral bleaching observed at multiple reefs in all regions,' a statement accompanying the report said. 'This is the fourth mass bleaching event since 2016 and the sixth to occur on the Great Barrier Reef since 1998.' It was the first mass bleaching event recorded during a cooler La Nina year. Scientists from the marine park authority and the Australian Institute of Marine Science surveyed 719 shallow water reefs between the Torres Strait and the Capricorn Bunker Group at the southern end of the reef system, mostly using helicopters. They found 654 reefs showed some bleaching. A map published with the report shows the most severe and extreme bleaching occurred in the region that covers the areas most visited by tourists. The report said inshore and offshore reefs were badly affected. Scientists from the marine park authority were not available to comment on the report on Tuesday night. The authority's chief scientist, Dr David Wachenfeld, told the Guardian in March that bleaching was not expected in a La Nina. 'But having said that, the climate is changing and the planet and the reef is about 1.5 degrees centigrade warmer than it was 150 years ago,' he said. 'Because of that, the weather is changing. Unexpected events are now to be expected. Nothing surprises me any more.' Lissa Schindler, a campaign manager with the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said the report was 'devastating news for anyone who loves the reef' and 'yet more evidence' cutting fossil fuel emissions should be top priority for the next Australian government. 'This was a La Nina year, normally characterised by more cloud cover and rain,' she said. 'It should have been a welcome reprieve for our reef to help it recover and yet the snapshot shows more than 90% of the reefs surveyed exhibited some bleaching. 'Although bleaching is becoming more and more frequent, this is not normal and we should not accept that this is the way things are. We need to break the norms that are breaking our reef.' Schindler said while Labor had a commitment to make bigger emissions cuts by 2030 than the Coalition, neither party had targets in line with what would be needed globally to save the reef. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found limiting global heating to 1.5C rather than 2C would probably be the difference between the survival of some tropical reef corals and their complete decline. A report by Climate Analytics found the Coalition's 2030 emissions reduction target was consistent with more than 3C of heating and Labor's target about 2C. The director of research at the Climate Council, Dr Simon Bradshaw, said: 'This is an issue that cannot be solved with big shiny funding announcements. The science is very clear: in order to save the world's reefs from total destruction, we must dramatically reduce emissions in the 2020s.' Scientists started raising the alarm for this year's bleaching event in December, when ocean temperatures over the reef hit a record high for that month. Bleaching occurs when the coral becomes stressed from above-average water temperatures. The coral animal expels the photosynthetic algae that lives inside it and provides the coral with food and its colour. Corals can survive bleaching events. Scientists plan to carry out in-water checks to see how many corals survived and regained their algae and colour between now and the end of the year. Studies have shown that heat stress can have several 'sublethal' effects on corals, including making them more susceptible to disease, slowing their growth and limiting their ability to spawn. The results of the surveys are expected to inform a report by a United Nations mission that visited the reef in March to check on its health and management. Scientists from Unesco and the International Union for Conservation of Nature were briefed on the surveys during the 10-day monitoring trip. Their report is due before the next world heritage meeting, currently scheduled for June. Last year, scientific advisors at Unesco recommended the reef be placed on a list of world heritage sites 'in danger' due to the impact of the climate crisis and slow progress on improving water quality. Sustained lobbying from the Morrison government led the 21-country committee to go against that advice. The release of the report and maps follows scientists and conservationists calling on the marine authority to make them public. SBS reported that Paul Hardisty, the chief executive of the Australian Marine Institute of Science, had told a meeting of his staff that the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet advised releasing the survey results during the federal election campaign would have breached caretaker conventions. Conservationists have also called on the government to release the state of the environment report, a five-yearly national assessment that has been sitting with the environment minister, Sussan Ley, since December.", "d1050ca953dac1b59747e824d7330fb837e0e102e8ebb8b5df052c98": "Belgian cartoonist Pieter De Poortere was trying to do his bit for the environment: eating less meat and diligently sorting his rubbish - glass, paper, plastics. He realised it wasn't enough. 'I thought if we all sort out our trash, then everything will be recycled, everything will be OK, then we are doing great. But actually that is not true,' he said pointing to the problems of the global waste industry, where wealthy countries' plastic may be dumped, or burned on open fires in poorer countries. So he put his best-known character to work, as part of an international art project that launched in April, aiming to draw attention to the problem of plastic production. Dickie, a pudgy antihero with a bristly moustache, is a perpetual loser, whether in the guise of farmer, astronaut, fairytale hero, or biblical character. 'I always try to imagine what is the worst possible thing that could happen to Dickie,' said De Poortere of the character he created nearly two decades ago, who now has a permanent home in the Comics Art Museum in Brussels. Known as Boerke in the original Flemish, the series is drawn in a childlike style, but with a spiky black humour aimed squarely at adults. It has won prizes in Belgium, a country where comic strips are celebrated as high art. After years of mishaps, Dickie is now wreaking havoc on the environment - striking a disastrous deal with 'Plastics Inc', or shooting a kangaroo in a misguided attempt at cutting down on packaging waste. 'A lot of my work is very ambiguous,' De Poortere said. 'Dickie is sometimes bad, sometimes he is good, sometimes he is a loser, sometimes he is really greedy, he is selfish, he uses people ... People start reading it and they are laughing, but often they have to think twice, is this really happening?' Camille Duran, founder of the Swedish-based Cosmic Foundation, the organisation behind the Magnify initiative, the art project featuring De Poortere's work, said the aim of the project was to shift people's attention to the production of plastics, not just consumption. 'Even if demand is going to start to decrease as policy gets more ambitious, more [petrochemicals] facilities are getting permitted around the world.' Earlier this year, 173 countries pledged to develop a legally binding treaty by 2024 to end plastic pollution. The agreement, which will include measures to tackle plastic production, has been described as the most significant multilateral environmental accord since the Paris climate deal. Yet on current trends, plastic production is expected to double within the next 20 years and by 2050 could account for 15% of the world's annual carbon budget. Duran, who hopes to expand the project to other parts of the world, began by choosing three artists near some of the world's biggest petrochemical hotspots: Louisiana, Taiwan and Antwerp. The organisers hope the Dickie pages will help galvanise opposition to a giant plastics plant in Antwerp, planned by the British petrochemical company Ineos. Campaigners have launched a legal challenge to Antwerp's decision to grant Ineos a permit to build a chemicals installation to make ethylene from fracked US shale gas. The campaigners say the project will fuel single use plastics and fails to meet EU climate targets. Ineos counters that the installation will be the greenest of its kind and will aid the production of long-lasting plastics used in technology and healthcare. De Poortere's sequence on plastics runs throughout May in the Dutch-language weekly Knack. The artist plans to include the pages in a 50-page book covering other environmental emergencies, including global heating, which will be published in 2023. De Poortere, who was born in Ghent, knows Antwerp well, but chose not to locate his work in any particular place, to preserve a universal message. 'It is important to get that message through to the public - and not in an annoying way - but through art, through humour, through trying to convince people, just to make them think. I want to show a bit the absurdity of the reality.' Humans, he added, cannot stop doing 'stupid things that will be harmful to us. There is tragedy in this shortsightedness, but it is also the basis of a lot of humour.'", "1663d4e8e27e75e8fb36dcb81b24d25f7be6c7b3ae76edaf384629c3": "The international aviation industry has failed to meet all but one of 50 of its own climate targets in the past two decades, environment campaigners say. A report commissioned by the climate charity Possible assessed every target set by the industry since 2000 and found that nearly all had been missed, revised or quietly ignored. The charity says the findings undermine a UK government plan to leave airlines to reduce their emissions through self-regulation. Leo Murray, Possible's director of innovation, said: 'This forensic investigation shows just how implausible and credulous the government's jet-zero strategy is shaping up to be. How can we credibly expect this industry to overdeliver on emissions reduction when they've never met any of their previous climate targets? 'It's clear that we need to demand reduction via a frequent flyer levy, which would discourage the frequent flying by a small group of people which makes up the bulk of emissions from planes.' Air travel accounted for 2.1% of human-produced carbon dioxide emissions in 2019, equivalent to about 915m tonnes, according to the Air Transport Action Group. It is estimated that 15% of people take 70% of all flights, Possible says. The air targets report was written by researchers from the sustainability agency Green Gumption, who examined climate targets starting and finishing between 2000 and 2021, and assessed progress against some longer-term goals. They found that unclear definitions, opaque monitoring and inconsistent reporting made many targets difficult to assess, with many also suddenly changed, replaced or dropped within the study period. Moreover, even if the targets had been met, the researchers said, many were insufficiently ambitious to reduce aviation's climate impact. In 2007 Virgin Atlantic set a target of a 30% reduction in CO2 per revenue tonne kilometre (CO2/RTK) by 2020, which the company later described as 'a big target and we're sticking with it', according to the report. In a 2014 sustainability report, with a reduction in CO2/RTK of only 8% from baseline, the airline admitted: 'We're nearly halfway through our target period and know we have to pick up the pace.' But when Virgin's 2020 annual report was published, it no longer mentioned the 2020 target. The following year, a press release from the company announced a new target of 15% gross reduction in CO2/RTK by 2026. The researchers conclude that climate target setting is in effect a smokescreen for business as usual. Such targets 'appear to function principally as a tactic for giving an impression of progress and action to address aviation's environmental impacts to the public and policymakers, in order to prevent any policy barriers to ongoing growth in the industry', the report says. It includes a quote from Steve Ridgway, Virgin's chief executive in 2007, who said: 'It is important that the airline industry is being seen to do something.' The government's jet-zero strategy is due to be published in July and is expected to defy guidance from the climate change committee that deliberate policies will be needed to manage growth in demand for air travel in order to meet the UK's net-zero goals. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: 'This report wilfully ignores this government's historic investment in technology, fuel and market-based measures which will help us reach jet zero by 2050 without the need for further taxes. This includes PS180m to accelerate sustainable aviation fuel and PS685m to develop zero-carbon and low-emission aircraft technology.' The Guardian has contacted Virgin Atlantic for comment.", "f1e0332e2406032e4e0dc22427d373c4e8ba61c239f1bdb7442e4169": "Troops and armoured vehicles have been deployed across the city of Colombo and security officials given orders to shoot on sight anyone deemed to be participating in violence as anti-government protests continued to rock Sri Lanka. The crisis turned volatile earlier this week after pro-government supporters began attacking a camp of peaceful demonstrators who had been protesting against the government and the devastating economic crisis that has engulfed the island of 22 million people. As footage emerged on Wednesday of armoured military vehicles in Colombo and military checkpoints being set up across the country , fears grew that the path was being laid for a military takeover. A nationwide curfew has done nothing to stop protesters gathering to demand the resignation of the president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who stands accused of economic mismanagement and corruption that has left it in its worst financial crisis since independence. Security officials confirmed they had been ordered to use 'live ammunition' on those found to be involved in violence or vandalism, alleging that outbreaks of violence were a 'coordinated' campaign. Eight people have been killed and more than 200 injured in the violence that has ensued across the country since Monday's attacks by pro-government supporters. Mahinda Rajapaksa, the brother of the president, who resigned as prime minister on Monday following mounting public pressure, had to be evacuated at dawn on Tuesday from his official residence in Colombo after protesters tried to storm the building. He is currently sheltering at a naval base in the north-eastern city of Trincomalee. More than 100 buildings were set alight, including the homes of 41 pro-Rajapaksa politicians and a luxury hotel said to be owned by the Rajapaksas, as well as several buses that had been rumoured to be used as transport for pro-Rajapaksa supporters. The resignation of Mahinda Rajapaksa on Monday means the government has been dissolved and there is no cabinet. The opposition refused to form a proposed 'unity government' until Gotabaya Rajapaksa agreed to step down within a stipulated period and abolish the system of executive presidency. Forming an interim government is a matter of urgency for Sri Lanka, both to ensure the country's economic situation does not worsen further and to continue vital negotiations with the International Monetary Fund, which the country is relying on for financial support and billions in emergency loans. The central bank chief warned on Wednesday that Sri Lanka's economy will 'collapse' unless a new government is urgently appointed and said he would resign if an interim prime minister wasn't appointed within days. In an address to the nation on Wednesday night, Gotabaya Rajapaksa said he would appoint a new prime minister and cabinet within the week and promised to take steps towards abolishing the executive presidency, as was demanded by the opposition. However, he stopped short of resigning. 'After the country is stable under the new Government, I will speak to everyone and create an environment for the abolishment of the executive presidency,' said Rajapaksa.  Many expressed concern that the military might try to step into the power vacuum left by the dissolved parliament. But speaking at a news conference, the defence ministry's top official, Kamal Gunaratne, denied allegations of a military takeover. 'None of our officers have a desire to take over the government. It has never happened in our country and it is not easy to do it here,' said Gunaratne. Sajith Premadasa, the leader of the main opposition SJP party who has refused to participate in a government under the Rajapaksas, accused the government of orchestrating mob violence in order to bring in martial law. 'In the guise of angry mobs, violence is being incited so military rule can be established,' he said. 'Rule of law should be maintained through the constitution, not with guns. It is time to empower citizens, not disempower them.' The US state department expressed concern over the military deployment in Sri Lanka. 'We stress that peaceful protesters should never be subjected to violence or intimidation, whether that's on the part of the military force or civilian units,' said a spokesperson, Ned Price. On Wednesday, Pope Francis appealed for calm in Sri Lanka and for authorities to 'listen to the aspirations of the people'. 'I offer a special thought to the people of Sri Lanka, in particular to the young, who in recent times have made their cry heard in the face of the country's social and economic challenges and problems,' he said at the end of his weekly audience.", "5e48fa7932d46cd41ca318fadf04a3ce0f2b5b90d77ec6a2c66d8296": "Al Jazeera has accused Israel of deliberately killing one of its reporters during a military raid in the occupied West Bank town of Jenin. Shireen Abu Aqleh, 51, a Palestinian American and one of the Arab world's best-known journalists, who had covered the conflict for decades, was shot in the head on Wednesday morning and taken to hospital in a critical condition. She had been covering a military raid in the Jenin refugee camp, a stronghold of the Palestinian Fatah movement and historical flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Abu Aqleh was wearing a helmet and body armour clearly marked 'press'. The Qatar-based television network said her colleagues at the scene said the veteran reporter was shot by Israeli forces. Al Jazeera called on the international community to hold Israeli forces accountable for their 'intentional targeting and killing' of Abu Aqleh. 'In a blatant murder, violating international laws and norms, the Israeli occupation forces assassinated in cold blood Al Jazeera's correspondent in Palestine,' it said. Shatha Hanaysha, a journalist for Quds News Network who witnessed the incident, said: 'Even after she fell to the ground the fire did not stop and none of us were able to reach her. A guy was finally able to reach us; he helped me and started pulling her. 'We were a group wearing press gear, and Shireen was even wearing the helmet. So it is obvious that the one who shot her meant to hit an exposed part of her body. This is an assassination.' The Israeli military said its troops shot back after coming under 'massive fire' in Jenin and that 'there is a possibility, now being looked into, that reporters were hit - possibly by shots fired by Palestinian gunmen.' The Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, claimed there was 'a considerable chance that armed Palestinians, who fired wildly, were the ones who brought about the journalist's unfortunate death.' But later on Wednesday the Israeli military chief, Lt Gen Aviv Kochavi, appeared to back away from officials' earlier assertions that Palestinians were to blame, saying: 'At this stage we cannot determine by whose fire she was harmed and we regret her death.' The Palestinian health ministry confirmed Abu Aqleh's death and said a second Al Jazeera employee, Ali Samodi, a producer, was wounded. Samodi told the New Palestinian from hospital: 'We were there to cover the events in Jenin camp. All of a sudden [the Israelis] opened fire at us, they didn't ask us to leave or stop. The first bullet hit me, the second one hit Shireen ... There were no resistance fighters around us. If there were, we wouldn't have been in that area.' In comments to Agence France-Presse, the Israel Defence Forces firmly denied they had deliberately targeted journalists. The Israeli foreign minister, Yair Lapid, said Israel had 'offered the Palestinians a joint pathological investigation'. The White House said it strongly condemned Abu Aqleh's killing and called for a thorough investigation to determine the circumstances of her death, as did Tom Nides, the US ambassador to Israel. The Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, said he held the Israeli military fully responsible for Abu Aqleh's death.  Violence has surged in Jenin in recent weeks. Israeli security forces have stepped up operations in the area after a spate of deadly terrorist attacks targeting Israelis that have left 19 people dead, launching near-daily raids on the hunt for terrorism suspects. Several of the attackers came from the Jenin area. Three Arab-Israelis and 28 Palestinians have died, among them Abu Aqleh, an unarmed woman and two apparent bystanders, as well as the perpetrators of attacks and Palestinian gunmen fighting with Israeli forces during the raids. Accompanying clashes at Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque compound, a site holy for Jews and Muslims, have also raised fears of escalation between Israel and Hamas, the Palestinian militant group in control of the Gaza Strip. Hamas has refrained from claiming responsibility for most of the recent terror attacks against Israelis, but in speeches leaders have praised the violence and called on Palestinians to carry out more, leading Israel to warn of retaliatory measures. Israel and Hamas fought an 11-day-war last May, in part triggered by unrest at al-Aqsa, in which 256 Gazans and 14 people in Israel died. Last year's fighting was the third round of full-scale conflict between the Israeli state and the Palestinian militant group since Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007 and Israel and Egypt imposed a punishing blockade. In April, UK-based lawyers with the International Federation of Journalists filed submissions to the international criminal court alleging a 'systematic targeting of journalists' by Israeli forces. At least 144 Palestinian journalists have been wounded by Israeli forces across the Gaza Strip, West Bank and East Jerusalem since 2018, hurt by live fire and rubber bullets, as well as stun grenades, teargas and beatings with batons, according to Reporters Without Borders. The Palestinian film-maker Yaser Murtaja was the last journalist to be killed covering the conflict, shot by Israeli snipers during protests on the Gaza Strip frontier in 2018. Another journalist, Yousef Abu Hussein, was killed when his home was hit by an airstrike during the bombing of Gaza last May. Abu Aqleh had worked for Al Jazeera since 1997 and was well known across the Arab world for her reporting during the second intifada, or uprising, against the Israeli occupation, and Israeli-Palestinian affairs since. 'Shireen was a brave, kind, and high-integrity journalist that I and millions of Palestinians grew up watching,' the prominent Ramallah-based activist Fadi Quran said in a tweet, calling her death 'a devastating tragedy'. As news of her death spread, Abu Aqleh's home in East Jerusalem was raided by Israeli security forces who confiscated Palestinian flags and prevented mourners from playing nationalistic songs. Demonstrators marched through the Beit Hanina neighbourhood until they were stopped by Israeli police, one resident said. The reporter's body was transferred from Nablus to Ramallah on Wednesday afternoon for an autopsy on the orders of the Palestinian public prosecution. A crowd gathered near Al Jazeera's offices in the Palestinian Authority's administrative centre to honour the journalist after her body arrived in an ambulance. A funeral will be held on Friday morning at the Palestinian presidency headquarters in Ramallah. During last year's war in Gaza, an Israeli airstrike destroyed a building housing the local offices of Al Jazeera and the Associated Press. Residents were warned to evacuate and no one was hurt in the strike. Israel said Hamas was using the building as a command centre but provided no evidence.", "08f77eaf0c06c25c6b0349afc936d7c3c4e0ac19a9271f667df5d4a8": "A Dutch court has sentenced 11 men to between one and nine years for maintaining an 'underworld prison' with a torture chamber, hidden in shipping containers, in a case that shocked the Netherlands. The case revolved around seven containers found by police almost two years ago in a southern Dutch forest, following up on information from a hack of the European-wide EncroChat encrypted phone system, popular with criminal gangs. During the raid, police found one of the containers was kitted out with a dentist's chair, along with pruning shears, a saw, scalpels and pliers. The other six containers were set up to be prison cells. 'The court found that the suspects all contributed to a plan to kidnap, ransom, blackmail, torture and kill criminal opponents or their relatives,' the Amsterdam district court said in a statement on Wednesday. 'The men formed a group based on a fight over money in the criminal world and planned to take the law into their own hands. The lack of respect for the personal freedom and integrity of others is shocking.'  Dutch media named the chief suspect as Roger P, 50, known by his underworld name 'Piet Costa' - allegedly because he often travelled to Costa Rica. Costa, who was jailed last month for 15 years for cocaine trafficking, was handed an additional 33-month sentence. Judges jailed his 40-year-old righthand man for eight years. Nine other men were also sentenced and one was acquitted. Dutch police discovered the prison complex after hacking the EncroChat encrypted system in 2020, and judges ruled that evidence from the system was admissible in court. The criminals sent chat messages via EncroChat, including saying 'we must have enough belts and tie-wraps to tie them' and 'we need cutting pliers for fingers and toes'. During the trial, one public prosecutor said that the evidence should remind recreational cocaine users of the consequences of their habits, a Dutch prosecutor has said. In a hearing in February, Koos Plooij told the court that the violence of the drug trade was a 'repulsive, but apparently unavoidable' result of the widespread use of illegal drugs in the Netherlands and neighbouring countries. 'The question is how many people are willing to admit that there is indeed a connection between their cocaine use - whether it is to party, deal with work stress or suppress psychological problems - and the underworld that is happy to answer demand but according to its own rules: corrupting, undermining, tough, sparing nothing and nobody,' Plooij said.", "e9f4398d4df3b4913959b0fd4a705eb86e130aecc5838b8344c34164": "A US judge has determined that Elon Musk's 2018 tweets that funding had been secured to take electric car maker Tesla private was inaccurate and reckless, saying 'there was nothing concrete' about financing from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund at that time. San Francisco-based US district judge Edward Chen's pre-trial decision represented a major victory for investors in a lawsuit accusing the world's richest person of inflating stock prices by making false and misleading statements, causing billions of dollars in damages. Chen granted the shareholders summary judgment on the issue of whether Musk knowingly made false statements but declined to grant them summary judgment on the question of whether these statements actually impacted Tesla's share prices. In 2018, Musk met with representatives of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and had a discussion about taking Tesla private, but evidence showed that 'there was nothing concrete about funding coming from the PIF', the judge wrote. 'Rather, discussions between Tesla and the PIF were clearly at the preliminary stage,' Chen said. 'No reasonable jury could find that Mr Musk did not act recklessly given his clear knowledge of the discussions,' the judge added. Chen said details such as the total amount of funding needed to take Tesla private or the price to be paid for Tesla stock were not discussed. The summary judgment, made on 1 April, was sealed for more than a month before it was made publicly available on Tuesday. 'It is hugely significant,' shareholder attorney Nicholas Porritt, a partner at Levi & Korsinsky LLP told Reuters. Porritt said it is rare that a judge decides that a defendant knowingly made false statements in summary judgment before a jury trial begins. The remaining issue is what damages the intentionally false statement has caused to shareholders, Porritt said. Musk's lawyer, who has filed motions to undo the court decision, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Musk last month said that funding was actually secured to take Tesla private in 2018. Chen's ruling was in line with a complaint from the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The securities regulator in 2018 sued Musk for fraud relating to the tweets. Musk then settled with the SEC, stepping down as Tesla chairman, paying fines and agreeing to have a lawyer approve some of his tweets before posting them.", "88ddd450ddb107c3a51d543572c26784a871d26a5a43a2370ea9d18f": "Twenty women have come forward to openly accuse one of France's best-known television news presenters of sexual harassment and abuse - including rape - following an investigation by French journalists. Patrick Poivre d'Arvor - known as PPDA - has faced a number of accusations that emerged after a writer first went to police to accuse him of rape, in February last year. The investigation was later dropped. The news presenter responded by announcing last month he was taking legal action against 16 women who spoke to detectives for 'slanderous denunciation'. On Tuesday, the investigative website Mediapart interviewed 18 women - 16 of them prepared to be named and filmed for the programme PPDA: 30 Years of Silence, and two who were present but hid their faces. A further two alleged victims were named and filmed talking of their encounters with the television star separately. The majority of the alleged sexual offences, which reportedly began in 1980, are now beyond the time limit for criminal proceedings under French law. Two of the alleged victims, who are now aged between 28 and 63 years, were minors at the time. Many of the alleged assaults reportedly took place in the presenter's office at the television station after he had finished reading the prime-time news. Poivre d'Arvor, 74, has always denied any wrongdoing and insisted his relations with the women were consensual and part of a ritual of 'seduction' involving no violence or constraint. He has described the allegations as 'false from beginning to end'. A preliminary police investigation was launched in February last year when writer and journalist Florence Porcel, 38, accused Poivre d'Arvor of two counts of rape in 2004 and 2009. The investigation was dropped four months later as a judge said there was insufficient evidence on either side to press charges and the allegations were beyond the legal time limit. However, media coverage of Porcel's accusation led to 22 other women coming forward to give evidence to the police. Seventeen of them lodged formal complaints, eight of them alleging rape, but the cases fell outside the time limit for prosecutions under French law and were not pursued. Three other cases are under investigation. Mediapart journalist Marine Turchi said the women had not met as a group before the programme was recorded and most had never spoken publicly before. Most of them said they had not spoken out at the time of the alleged assaults and rapes - except in some cases to family and friends - because they were afraid they would not be believed or that doing so would damage their careers. Nonce Paolini, the former chief executive of TF1, who ended Poivre d'Arvor's contract in 2008, told Mediapart he had not known of the alleged abuse and harassment, which he described as 'revolting'. 'If we'd known anything, there would have been punishment. Obviously we didn't know,' he said. Paolini added: 'I want to tell these women that their suffering cannot leave anyone indifferent, especially not me either as a man, or as the former head [of the company]. I hope they will be able to get their cases reviewed by the courts.' Porcel said the women had formed a support group. 'We wanted to show that we are united, that we are solid, that we are facing this together and that Patrick Poivre d'Arvor no longer makes us afraid. It seems also important to say I'm still standing and I intend to continue standing.' Porcel is pursuing further legal action against Poivre d'Arvor. Teacher Margaux Coquil-Gleizes described how she met Poivre d'Arvor when she was 17 and an aspiring novelist. She said he invited her to his hotel room. 'I was young, naive, impressionable, flattered by the attention that Poivre d'Arvor was going to pay to my writing.' Once in the room she said the television star 'pushed me on the bed, he undressed, he took my clothes off and penetrated me. At the time I was paralysed. It took a very long time for me to realise that it was a rape by surprise.' Journalist Justine Ducharne said she did not want to discuss details of what happened to her but described it as 'a horror'. Last year, Poivre d'Arvor accused the women of hiding behind anonymity. 'Nobody has dared come forward, face to face, to tell me what I did was not acceptable.' He did not accept Mediapart's invitation to take part in the two-hour programme. In his 43-page legal complaint for slander against 16 of his accusers, Poivre d'Arvor deplored 'a return to puritanism and censorship cleverly dressed up as the supposed protection of women'. He said: 'Since the excitement generated by the #MeToo wave, the liberation of women's voices has unfortunately had its share of excesses and abuses.' He also claimed the women were seeking fame and revenge. 'No credit can be given to these 16 women, journalists or writers in search of fame who have become sudden feminists to support a former colleague, a friend, or even a simple activist for the women's cause,' he said. 'It is all about revenge on the part of women who have not received more consideration, or even a glance, from a man they once admired. '[This] makes the rejected or ignored respondents very bitter today, a bitterness that leads them to commit, out of belated revenge, the crime of slanderous denunciation.' Turchi said Poivre d'Arvor and his lawyers had been approached to take part in the programme. 'We would have liked him to express himself and we asked him to do so, but he refused,' she said. Poivre d'Arvor's lawyer, Philippe Naepels, had not responded to the Guardian at the time of writing.", "34ea5519dc40c5bf3b4b51de46620398a94707163da3bea0dd594cb6": "Liz Truss has been warned of a major rebellion over plans for a bill that could revoke parts of the Northern Ireland protocol, amid fresh concern in Washington over the UK's approach. European Union insiders have warned that the British government's threat to abandon parts of the Northern Ireland protocol risks undermining the international alliance against Vladimir Putin. Officials in Brussels were 'flabbergasted' at the timing of an intervention from the UK foreign secretary, who issued a statement on Tuesday night saying she would 'not shy away' from taking unilateral action on the protocol. The bill, which is expected to be discussed by cabinet ministers on Thursday, could be revealed next Tuesday.  Doubling down on Truss's remarks, Michael Gove warned the EU that 'no option is off the table', after the UK argued the solution put forward by Brussels last October would worsen food shortages. According to a report in the Times the attorney general, Suella Braverman, has approved the plans to scrap swathes of the protocol - a move which would grant Boris Johnson a legal green light to move ahead. In her submission, Braverman reportedly cited the Good Friday agreement as having a greater significance than the protocol, but says that it is being undermined by the trade barrier in the Irish Sea and rising civil unrest. Between 30 and 50 Conservative MPs canvassed by colleagues said they had significant doubts about whether they could vote for a bill that would unpick an international treaty. Most dismissed the prospect of the bill's success and described it as a negotiating tactic. Senior MPs warned there were a number of ministers prepared to resign if faced with passing the bill into law. Sources close to Truss have stressed that no final decision has been made and that any potential legislation is intended to run in parallel with further talks. The Northern Ireland minister Conor Burns, styled under a new title of special representative to the US on the NI protocol, was dispatched to Washington this week to speak to senior US figures about the negotiations. They were reported to have been blindsided by the leak of the proposed bill to the Times earlier this week. Burns arrived in Boston on Monday before travelling to DC for meetings with the Department of State and the senior director at the National Security Council, Amanda Sloat, as well as some senators and representatives from the influential Friends of Ireland group. One source described Burns as being keen to point out his close friendship with Johnson. A White House spokesperson said: 'We recognise that there have been challenges over the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol and that talks continue between the UK and EU to resolve these issues. 'President Biden has long made clear his strong support for the Belfast/Good Friday agreement. We underscore our continued support for a secure and prosperous Northern Ireland in which all communities have a voice and enjoy the gains of the hard-won peace.' In Westminster, MPs said there was already a strong opposition forming against the principle of the bill, but said most were prepared to stomach difficult negotiating tactics. But they said they expected senior voices to speak out if it went ahead, including one ex-minister who said the former prime minister Theresa May would go further than she had over the internal markets bill which had provoked a number of resignations but was pulled last year. May made a stern intervention on the plans in the House of Commons and MPs described her comments as 'opening fire' for more widespread Tory concern. Tobias Ellwood, chair of the defence select committee, said there was widespread concern about the proposed legislation. 'Abandoning the protocol is self-defeating. It plays into Sinn Fein's narrative that a united, peaceful Ireland is better for Northern Ireland,' he told the Guardian. 'Binning the protocol will provoke a trade war with the EU at a time when the UK has done so well in leading the European response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It will mean fewer movements of goods and higher inflation.' Most MPs said they would wait to see how much the proposed bill was a device to reignite negotiations. Another MP said there was 'huge difference between making preparatory steps as a negotiating tactic which some would understand - and going as far as to whip colleagues to break from an international treaty'. A third said: 'As long as it's posturing, it's tolerable. If they go through with breaking the protocol, there will be opposition.' Another former minister said they believed Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, had significant concerns about escalatory action by the EU - which has said it could suspend the free trade agreement. 'The last thing the Treasury needs is that pressure on supply chains.' EU leaders have also voiced alarm. Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign affairs minister, said Truss's briefing to the press had gone down 'really badly' in Europe, warning that unilateral action would potentially plunge the UK into a trade war with the EU. The EU had been expecting UK ministers to ramp up their approach after the public comments from Johnson and Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg about bringing forward 'reforms'. Broadly, the threats were seen as sabre-rattling designed to achieve leverage for the UK side ahead of the resumption of talks between Truss and the EU's Maros Sefcovic. But relations deteriorated on Wednesday, with Coveney saying the 'partnership' that has kept Northern Ireland stable is 'absent at the moment'. Speaking on a visit to Sweden, Johnson told BBC News there was no need for major EU retaliation. His spokesperson declined to say if the government had modelled the potential economic cost of a trade war. Talks between the UK and the EU about the protocol are about to resume following a pause for the Northern Ireland elections. If the UK abandoned the protocol, the EU could take legal action and restart previous litigation against the UK that the European Commission paused last July, as well as potentially imposing tariffs on British goods or even suspending the EU-UK free-trade agreement.", "c99cdc25d177ebe22c57a66c027d67a6bb929a1b824224e790b7bd79": "The Vatican has voiced concern after Hong Kong's national security police arrested 90-year-old Cardinal Joseph Zen, one of Asia's most senior and outspoken Catholic clerics. Zen, a former bishop of Hong Kong, was arrested along with the singer and actor Denise Ho, the lawyer Margaret Ng, and the scholar Hui Po-keung. 'The Holy See has learnt the news of Cardinal Zen's arrest with concern and is following the development of the situation very closely,' the Vatican said in a statement. Local reports earlier suggested the arrests were related to their roles as trustees of the 612 Humanitarian Relief Fund, which provided legal aid and other financial help to people who took part in the 2019 pro-democracy protests that were quashed by security forces. Hui was arrested at the airport as he was about to board a flight to Germany on Tuesday, local media reported. Another trustee, Cyd Ho, is already in jail for her alleged involvement in illegal assemblies. Late on Wednesday evening, Hong Kong's police confirmed the arrest on Tuesday and Wednesday of two men and two women, aged 45 to 90, for alleged 'collusion with foreign forces'. The force said that all had been released on bail but had their passports forfeited under the national security legislation. Last year, the city's police department said in a statement that it was investigating the charity for suspected violations of the national security law. The fund has now been scrapped after the disbandment of a company that had helped receive donations through a bank account. Hui, a former adjunct associate professor of cultural studies at Lingnan University, had once taught the exiled political activist Nathan Law. 'If you want to punish someone, you can always find an excuse,' Law, who now lives in Britain, wrote on his Facebook page in response to Hui's arrest. In 2020, Cardinal Zen made a personal appeal to the Vatican in a letter, urging Pope Francis to leave politics out of the selection of Catholic bishops in the Chinese territory. He did not manage to meet the pope because, according to local media, the Holy See was at the time engaged in discussions with Beijing on the renewal of a power-sharing agreement on the ordination of bishops in the Chinese mainland. This week's arrests were the authorities' latest move in enforcing the controversial national security law, which was imposed on the city in June 2020. The legislation bars secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces. They also came less than a week after the incoming chief executive, John Lee, was selected by a small number of elite voters on Sunday. Although Beijing and Hong Kong authorities insisted the national security law had brought stability to Hong Kong after the 2019 mass demonstrations, activists pointed out that since the enactment of the legislation, at least 175 people have been arrested and more than 110 have been charged. Responding to the latest arrests, the White House spokesperson, Karine Jean-Peirre, urged the authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong to release Zen and the others who had been detained. In the UK, Labour's shadow minister for Asia and Pacific, Catherine West, said in a tweet that the arrests 'are a further demonstration of China's aim to stamp out opposition in Hong Kong, and are completely at odds with the freedoms promised to Hong Kong'. She urged the British government to 'work with international partners to demand the release of those detained'. Maya Wang, Human Rights Watch's China senior researcher, said arresting Zen for his peaceful activities 'has to be a shocking new low for Hong Kong, illustrating the city's free fall in human rights in the past two years'. The arrests were condemned by US politicians, with Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a member of the senate intelligence committee, saying it showed the ruling Communist party and its leader, Xi Jinping, were 'afraid of truth-tellers and labels them threats to national security. [Xi is] absolutely terrified of a 90-year old Catholic cardinal. Xi is a pathetic coward.'

While running for a student council role in the mid-1990s, the Walthamstow MP said she was reprimanded by college authorities instead of action being taken against the men involved. 'I'm in my mid-40s now and it's the first time I've really felt even willing to talk about it,' Creasy said in an interview with the broadcaster and former Labour MP Gloria De Piero for GB News. 'It was terrifying at the time, I'm terrified I'll ever run into those young men again.' There have been a slew of revelations about sexism and harassment in Westminster, and up to 56 MPs have been accused of sexual misconduct. But Creasy, a prominent campaigner for women's rights, including granting mothers the resources to run for parliament, said a culture of 'privilege and entitlement' was not unique to parliament but a problem in universities as well. 'It's always the men that people think are least likely to do it who are involved in it,' she said. She said she had experienced sexual harassment 'all my life' and she remained terrified of seeing the men who had threatened her at university, who she said had gone on to be doctors, civil servants and 'high flyers'. After running into the men several years after the incident, she said, she collapsed to a bar floor and left as soon as she could. Creasy said the abuse would always affect her. She said her first experience of sexual harassment was during her first year at Magdalene College and lasted from 1996 to 1998. She said it included a campaign of abusive posters when she ran for the role of president of the college's student council. 'I'll never forget the night that I was in a room with them all and they threatened to gang-rape me, let alone the posters that they put up around the college when I had the temerity to stand for a position in the student union, telling people not to vote for me because of who I'd slept with,' she said. 'And that happened at a Cambridge college. 'I was held up and I was admonished by the college authorities at the time because they chose to believe the idea that I was probably 'a wronged woman',' she said. 'And, as I say, it took public humiliation, and posters, and finally other people coming forward, and me collating the evidence - of all the notes, the spitting in my room, the rubbish that was thrown at me, the sexual abuse and harassment if I tried to walk into the bar, that came from this group of young men.' Creasy studied psychology at Cambridge from 1996 to 1999, going on to gain a PhD from the London School of Economics. She entered the Commons in 2010. Addressing women with similar experiences, and those in parliament, she said: 'You will find allies, you will find those of us prepared to stand with you because we know what it's like, we know how hard it is and we know the impact it can have on you.' A Cambridge spokesperson said: 'We are extremely sorry to hear of the horrific ordeal which Stella Creasy experienced. Sexual harassment of any sort has absolutely no place at the university. In recent years the university has taken significant steps in order to provide support for victims of sexual misconduct, to improve systems for reporting any incidents, and to take action as a result. 'We urge anyone who experiences any form of harassment or abuse to report it so that they can be offered support and action can be taken. The university employs a sexual assault and harassment adviser to provide specialist support to victims.'", "f7b8d498e3ec78299807522bab8cfb34631671167d6f0add0fb0694e": "Babis Anagnostopoulos, the Greek pilot accused of killing his British wife as she slept in their Athens home, had waited for his moment in court and, a year to the day after she took her last breath, he got it. For almost 10 hours on Wednesday the UK-trained aviator stood in the dock relating the alleged events that led to the fatal moment on 11 May 2021 when he 'lost control' and smothered Caroline Crouch, 20, to death with a pillow. The body of the couple's dog was also found dangling inside the maisonette's hallway. No detail was too small for the court now tasked with determining whether the 34-year-old Greek should spend the next two decades in prison for a crime that has gripped the country. 'There is no excuse [for my actions] ... what has been lost is irreplaceable. Neither Caroline nor our dog deserved it,' he told the three-member panel of presiding judges at the start of the deposition. 'There are not enough times that I can say sorry. I will tell you in detail, and sincerely, what exactly happened.' During his testimony, Anagnostopoulos spoke of what he called his unwavering love for the student he had met on the island of Alonissos when she was 15. Over the course of their four-year relationship, the couple had enjoyed 'fairytale' times including an idyllic, spur-of-the moment wedding in Portugal 'that you only see in films'. 'My absolute priority in everything was her happiness,' he said describing his joy when Caroline, who had previously suffered a miscarriage, gave birth to their daughter Lydia. 'She may have been younger but she was very mature and she was maturing fast.' The judge repeatedly interjected, cajoling the defendant - described by psychologists who had also testified in the court as 'narcissistic and controlling' - for speaking of his wife in the present 'when she is dead and cannot be brought back' and urging him not to 'overanalyse'. For 37 days Anagnostopoulos had tried to pin the murder on a botched break-in by ruthless foreign thieves, prompting police to speak of the pilot's skills as a consummate actor. On Wednesday his self-described goal was to prove that Crouch's death had not been premeditated but was instead the result of his being in a 'blurred state of mind' that should be considered a crime of passion and treated more leniently. He had previously attempted to lay the blame on the Briton's 'dangerous outbursts' saying he had also been a victim of her physical abuse when, in heated moments, she had lunged out and 'punched and kicked me'. On the night in question, he had got especially angry, he recalled, when she refused to apologise for her part in a row and had threatened to hit their daughter - who he subsequently placed next to her dead mother's body. 'I got on top of her [in the couple's bed] so she couldn't hit me so easily,' he told the Athens court, saying he believed he had been pushed to the edge by the woman he had otherwise loved. 'I told her to calm down ... she was saying 'get up, leave me, go away' and other swear words which I'd rather not say. Then I took my pillow and I placed it over her head.' When asked by the judge how such love could suddenly transition into such violence he responded: 'I had no purpose. There was no logic in my blurred mind at that moment ... and when I saw her in profile and understood she was dead from her eyes which were open and her pulse, I lost it, I began to weep and pull my hair and go back and forth across the room ... from the day I lost Caroline I lost everything, I lost my life. ' Anagnostopoulos - the son of a schoolteacher and civil engineer - stands accused of premeditated murder, the unprovoked killing of an animal and perverting the course of justice by repeatedly lying to police - charges that carry life in prison. On Wednesday, he conceded he had hung Caroline's seven-month-old puppy, Roxy, from the banister of the couple's two-storey maisonette to make the crime look more credible. 'It was impossible to look, I left and went into the kitchen so I couldn't see or hear [it die].' The defendant broke down and wept on Tuesday when excerpts of Crouch's handwritten diary were read out to the court.  His closing words to the court were: 'I hope all those who have been hurt, all those who have lost, will some day forgive me. I hope that God will forgive me. I will never forgive myself.' Crouch had described her feelings of powerlessness in a marriage that had increasingly left her feeling trapped and suffocated. She was the 17th woman to be murdered at the hands of a partner in Greece last year. The court will reconvene on Monday, when it is likely to issue its verdict.", "b2ece87c4f56b8c0de8b6bf187ea451cf90abcf73dbe284c8e859640": "An Arizona man convicted of killing a college student in 1978 was killed by the state on Wednesday after a nearly eight-year hiatus in its use of the death penalty, brought on by an execution critics say was botched and difficulty in finding lethal drugs. Clarence Dixon, 66, died by lethal injection at the state prison in Florence for his conviction in the killing of 21-year-old Arizona State University student Deana Bowdoin. He was the sixth person to be executed in the US in 2022. Dixon's death was announced by Frank Strada, a deputy director with Arizona department of corrections, rehabilitation and re-entry. The execution appeared to go smoothly, said Troy Hayden, an anchor for the Fox10 TV news program who witnessed it. 'Once the drugs started flowing, he went to sleep almost immediately,' Hayden said. Dixon's lawyers made last-minute arguments to the courts to postpone his execution, but judges rejected the argument that he was not mentally fit to be executed and did not have a rational understanding of why the state wanted to execute him. The US supreme court rejected a last-minute delay of Dixon's execution less than an hour before it began. Dixon declined the option of being killed in the gas chamber - a method that has not been used in the US in more than two decades - after Arizona refurbished its chamber in late 2020. He was executed with an injection of pentobarbital. Strada said Dixon's last statement was: 'The Arizona supreme court should follow the laws. They denied my appeals and petitions to change the outcome of this trial. I do and will always proclaim innocence. Now, let's do this [expletive].' The last time Arizona executed a prisoner was in July 2014, when Joseph Wood was given 15 doses of a two-drug combination over two hours in an execution his lawyers said was botched. Wood snorted repeatedly and gasped more than 600 times before he died. States including Arizona have struggled to buy execution drugs after US and European pharmaceutical companies began blocking the use of their products in lethal injections. Authorities have said Bowdoin, who was found dead in her apartment in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe, was raped, stabbed and strangled with a belt. Dixon, who was an ASU student at the time and lived across the street, was charged with raping Bowdoin but the charge was later dropped on statute-of-limitation grounds. He was convicted of murder. In arguing that Dixon was mentally unfit, his lawyers said he erroneously believed he would be executed because police at Northern Arizona University wrongfully arrested him in another case - a 1985 attack on a 21-year-old student. His attorneys conceded he was lawfully arrested by Flagstaff police. Dixon was sentenced to life in prison in that case for sexual assault and other convictions. DNA samples taken in prison linked him to the killing of Bowdoin. Prosecutors said there was nothing about Dixon's beliefs that prevented him from understanding the reason for the execution and pointed to court filings Dixon made. Defense lawyers said Dixon was repeatedly diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, regularly experienced hallucinations and was found 'not guilty by reason of insanity' in a 1977 assault case in which the verdict was delivered by then-Maricopa county superior court judge Sandra Day O'Connor, nearly four years before her appointment to the US supreme court. Bowdoin was killed two days after that verdict, according to court records. Another Arizona death-row prisoner, Frank Atwood, is scheduled to be executed on 8 June in the killing of eight-year-old Vicki Lynne Hoskinson in 1984. Authorities have said Atwood kidnapped the girl. The child's remains was discovered in the desert north-west of Tucson nearly seven months after her disappearance. Experts could not determine the cause of death from the bones that were found, according to court records.

One Sunday in May 2021, he applied for a data analyst position at Bloomberg in London that looked like the perfect fit. He received an immediate response, asking him to take a digital assessment. It was strange. The assessment showed him different shapes and asked him to figure out the pattern. He started feeling incredulous. 'Shouldn't we be testing my abilities on the job?' he asked himself. The next day, a Monday, which happened to be a public holiday in the UK, he got a rejection email. He decided to email a recruiter at Bloomberg. Maybe the company made a mistake? What Burch discovered offers insight into a larger phenomenon that is baffling experts: while there are record level job openings in both the UK and in the US, why do many people still have to apply to sometimes hundreds of jobs, even in sought-after fields like software development, while many companies complain they can't find the right talent? Some experts argue that algorithms and artificial intelligence now used extensively in hiring are playing a role. This is a huge shift, because until relatively recently, most hiring managers would handle applications and resumes themselves. Yet recent findings have shown that some of these new tools discriminate against women and use criteria unrelated to work to 'predict' job success. While companies and vendors are not required to disclose if they use artificial intelligence or algorithms to select and hire job applicants, in my reporting I have learned that this is widespread. All the leading job platforms - including LinkedIn, ZipRecruiter, Indeed, CareerBuilder, and Monster - have told me they deploy some of these technologies. Ian Siegel, the CEO of ZipRecruiter, said that artificial intelligence and algorithms have already conquered the field. He estimates that at least three-quarters of all resumes submitted for jobs in the US are read by algorithms. 'The dawn of robot recruiting has come and went and people just haven't caught up to the realization yet,' he said. A 2021 survey of recruiting executives by the research and consulting firm Gartner found that almost all reported using AI for at least one part of the recruiting and hiring process.  Yet it is not foolproof. One of the most consequential findings comes from Harvard Business School professor Joe Fuller, whose team surveyed more than 2,250 business leaders in the US, UK and Germany. Their motives for using algorithmic tools were efficiency and saving costs. Yet 88% of executives said that they know their tools reject qualified candidates. Despite the prevalence of the technology, there have just been a few famous cases of misfires. A few years back, Amazon discovered that its resume screener tool was biased against women. The algorithm was trained on resumes of current employees, who skewed male, reflecting a gender disparity in many tech fields. Over time, the tool picked up on male preferences and systematically downgraded people with the word 'women' on their resumes, as in 'women's chess club' or 'women's soccer team.' Amazon's engineers tried to fix the problem, but they couldn't and the company discontinued the tool in 2018. 'This project was only ever explored on a trial basis, and was always used with human supervision,' said Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser. AI vendors that build these kinds of technologies say that algorithm-based tools democratize the hiring process by giving everyone a fair chance. If a company is drowning in applications, many human recruiters read only a fraction of the applications. An AI analyzes all of them and any assessments and judges every candidate the same way. Another benefit, these vendors say, is if employers choose to focus on skills and not on educational achievements like college degrees, applicants from diverse backgrounds who are often overlooked can get to the next stage of the process. 'At the end of the day, we don't want people to be hired into roles that are going to drain them and not utilize their strengths. And so it's really not about rejecting people, it's about 'screening in' the right people,' said Caitlin MacGregor, CEO of Plum, which built the assessment Burch found so puzzling. MacGregor said the company's clients have increased their diversity and retention rates since they started to use Plum. She said the assessments helped hone in on applicants' 'potential'. But job candidates who have the necessary experience worry they're being unfairly weeded out when companies focus on elusive factors like potential or personality traits. 'This was the first time in my life, in my career, where I was sending out resumes and there was nothing,' said Javier Alvarez, 57, a distribution and sales manager from Monrovia, California, who sent out his resume more than 300 times on sites like LinkedIn and Indeed for jobs he said he was qualified for. No job offer materialized, and he started to wonder if he was being automatically excluded in some way - perhaps because of his age or salary requirements. 'I felt hopeless. I started to doubt my abilities.' Ronnie Riley, a 29-year-old event planner from Canada, had a gap of several years in their resume because of an illness. Riley applied to more than 100 event planning and some administrative assistant jobs in December 2021, and over 70 jobs in January, but ended up with a total of five interviews and no job offers. They worry the gap is the reason. 'It just seems it's discounting a whole bunch of people that could be perfect for the job,' they said. Fuller's research has helped provide answers to how exactly automatic rejections occur. One reason, he found, is that too often, job descriptions include too many criteria and skills. Many employers add new skills and criteria to existing job descriptions, building a long list of requirements. Algorithms end up rejecting many qualified applicants who may be missing just a couple of skills from the list. One executive Fuller spoke with said their company's tool has been rejecting qualified candidates because they scored low in one important category, even when they got a near perfect score in all the other important categories. The company found that it was left with job applicants who received mediocre scores across the board. (Longer job descriptions may also deter more female applicants, Fuller believes, since many women apply to jobs only when they fulfill most of the requirements.) Another reason qualified candidates are rejected by automated systems are so-called knockout criteria. In Fuller's research, he found that almost 50% of the executives surveyed acknowledged that their automatic systems reject job applicants outright who have a work gap longer than six months on their resumes. These applicants never get in front of a hiring manager, even if they are the most qualified candidates for the job. 'The six month gap is a really insidious filter,' said Fuller, since it's probably built on the assumption that a gap signifies something ominous, but may simply represent military deployments, pregnancy complications, caregiving obligations or illness. Experts contacted by the Guardian also described automatic resume screeners making mistakes similar to the infamous Amazon example, rooted in learning biases from an existing dataset. This hints at how these programs could end up enforcing the kinds of racial and gender biases observed with other AI tools, such as facial recognition tech and algorithms used in health care. John Scott is the chief operating officer of APMetrics, an organization that helps companies identify talent, and is often brought in by larger companies to check if new technologies the company wants to buy from a vendor are fair and legal. Scott has examined multiple resume screeners and recruiting tools and discovered problems in all of them. He found biased criteria unrelated to work, such as the name Thomas and the keyword church, to 'predict' success in a job. Mark Girouard, an employment lawyer in Minneapolis, found that the name Jared and having played lacrosse in high school were used as predictors of success in one system. Martin Burch, the London jobseeker, discovered he had been weeded out in a different way. He contacted a human recruiter at Bloomberg and asked her to look at his CV. His experience lined up with the job description and this was a direct competitor, making his background all the more valuable, he thought. But the problem turned out to be the pattern-finding and personality test he had taken, which was created by Plum. A recruiter at Bloomberg replied: 'I can see that your application was rejected due to not meeting our benchmark in the Plum assessment that you completed. Unfortunately on that basis we are not able to take your application any further.' Burch felt stunned that he had indeed been rejected by a piece of code. He retained a lawyer, and in communications with Bloomberg asked for a human review of his application. Bloomberg informed Burch that the role he applied for was no longer available and he wouldn't be able to be considered for it. Bloomberg did not return emails and calls asking for comment. As adoption of AI tools in hiring expands, lawmakers are starting to take a closer look. In the UK, the government is planning new regulation of algorithmic decision making. In the US, a recent local law requires employers to inform job seekers how their application materials are screened by AI upon request. And congressional lawmakers have introduced bills that would regulate AI in hiring at a national level, including the Algorithmic Accountability Act of 2022, but have faced hurdles getting them passed. Burch decided to file an official claim with the Information Commissioner's Office, an independent organization that upholds privacy laws in the UK. In February the office reprimanded Bloomberg, writing: 'From reviewing the information provided, it is our decision that there is more work for you to do. As such, we now expect you to take steps to address any outstanding issues with the individual.' Burch has since accepted PS8,000 ($9,864) in compensation from the company. He says he also fought to demonstrate a point: 'I am trying to prove to them that it's probably weeding out good candidates so they should probably stop using it.' Plum's CEO Caitlin MacGregor declined to comment on Burch's case directly, citing privacy concerns, but she stands behind her product: 'I should not be interviewing somebody that is a 35, regardless of how much experience they have. There is somewhere else that they are going to be their own 95 [percent] match.'", "450263a2bfd0d7417223868ee7c8392875ab1617e26ddb2651231795": "California officials are poised to decide the fate of a controversial desalination plant planned along its southern coast, in a vote that comes as the American west battles an increasingly perilous drought. California water use leapt 19% in March, amid one of the driest months on record. After more than a decade of debate, the California coastal commission on Thursday will finally vote on a proposal for a $1.4bn desalination plant in Huntington Beach, south of Los Angeles. As the west grows hotter and drier, the state and others in its neighborhood are seeing water supplies grow scarce. California is now facing its third consecutive year of crippling drought, with shortages spurring strict restrictions. Rising heat also means more water is needed to sustain people, ecosystems and the state's thirsty agricultural sector. Desalination plants, which convert seawater into potable water, have long been considered a possible solution, as residents, developers and policymakers look to capture the water crashing against the California shores. The Huntington Beach plant has prominent backers, including the state's governor, Senator Dianne Feinstein, the California Chamber of Commerce and a slew of other state and local officials. But experts say siphoning water from the sea isn't a simple answer to a complex and burgeoning crisis. Desalination plants require large amounts of energy to turn salt water into fresh water and have a significant impact on marine life. Critics of the Huntington Beach project have also argued that for all its costs, the plant wouldn't actually make water more accessible or affordable to the Californians who need it most. 'Desalination is intuitively appealing to the person on the street or your average policymaker,' said Dr Gregory Pierce, director of the human right to water solutions lab at University of California, Los Angeles. 'But in this case, it is going to make the water rich, richer.' If approved, the Huntington Beach plant would be California's 13th, and one of the largest in the nation. The facility proposed by the project development company Poseidon Water would pump in roughly 106m gallons (401m litres) of seawater each day, converting it to roughly 50m gallons of potable water. What's leftover - a thick salty brine - would be released back in the ocean. If approved, the construction on the plant is scheduled for as early as 2023 and it can be up and running three years later. Poseidon says the project will have an impact on declining water levels across the state, though the water will only be supplied locally in Orange county. '[The region] will not be pulling water from the Colorado River or northern California, which means that communities to the east of us and the north of us will be able to benefit from this project,' said Jessica Jones, a spokesperson for the company.  'It really impacts the entire west. With the drought situation we are in, and that we will continue to face for years and years, it is so important that we look to new supplies,' she said. Along with a new source of water, proponents of the project claim it will be a financial boon to the region, bringing in billions in revenue to Orange county and thousands of jobs. The company has committed to purchasing carbon offsets and investing in efforts like reforestation credits to counteract energy use, which Jones says will also be supplied by renewables. Skeptics, however, have questioned the company's commitment - and ability - to mitigate the environmental impact from the project expected by experts. Along with seawater, desalination plants suck small creatures into the system. Although the company will utilize screens with 1 millimeter mesh to limit the impact on animals, scientists at the Coastal Commission reviewing the proposal estimate the plant would still kill creatures such as fish larvae and plankton, 'resulting in substantial losses of marine ecosystem productivity'. Critics have also raised concerns over the plant's location. Concentrated in an area of industrial development, the facility would be situated on a partially remediated Superfund site, near a wastewater treatment plant, a former oil tank farm, and what was once a dump. Construction could spread contaminants from those sources into nearby disadvantaged communities, carried east by the coastal winds, critics warned. Beyond these concerns, some researchers have cautioned that the project would not benefit those most affected by California's water woes. Pierce, the UCLA professor, and a team of researchers studied the proposal in 2019. They concluded that the plant is located in an area of the state that's not hurting for high-quality, reliable water, but the project would make drinking water less affordable for disadvantaged households in Orange county. 'Proponents have vaguely asserted that there will be equity benefits from this plant but haven't provided any evidence of what that means,' he added. Instead, according to his team's research, the large cost of the project would raise overall water prices in the region, hurting those who already struggle the most to pay their water bill. Jones, the Poseidon spokesperson, said that while the project may push water rates higher, a local fixed rate could become more affordable than other sources in the dry decades to come. California's coastal commission, however, estimates that the cost of the project for low-income Orange county residents would be significant. Water rate hikes would 'disproportionately impact millions of low-income residents throughout Orange county water district's service area, the majority of which are people of color', the commission wrote in its report. 'We already know that this thing is not going to make water cheaper and it is not even reliable,' said Andrea Leon-Grossmann, director of climate action at Azul, a grassroots organization that works with Latino communities to protect the coast from industrialization, noting that previous plants produced less water than promised and can be compromised by oil spills, red tides and natural disasters. As part of the coalition against Poseidon, Azul and others submitted a 153-page report outlining issues to the coastal commission. Along with higher costs, Leon-Grossmann said her organization was concerned about plant emissions adding pollution to areas already facing stark disparities; increased dead zones, or areas in the ocean where plants and animals are unable to survive and perish in high numbers; and the threats from sea level rise, tsunamis and earthquakes, all of which could put the plant - and those who live near it - in greater jeopardy. California's governor, Gavin Newsom, has urged the commission to greenlight the project despite the criticism, arguing the drought emergency requires urgent answers. 'This administration is committed to ensuring the sustainability of California's water supply with an all-of-the above strategy, and that includes desalination,' a spokesperson for the governor said in a statement. 'The governor has supported this project for years and made clear that not approving this project would be a setback, while also encouraging accountability and environmental justice measures. Regions across California must continue to innovate on local projects as climate change makes our state's water supply more unpredictable.' Last month, Newsom was even more direct when talking about the desalination project with the Bay Area News Group editorial board, calling a vote against it a 'big mistake'. 'We need more tools in the damn tool kit,' he said, adding: 'Be tough. Be fair though. Don't be ideological.' Pierce argued he would 'make a big distinction between this particular plant and every desalination conversation elsewhere in California'. 'This is a backup supply for those who want to keep using water the ways we have used water,' he said. He argued that Orange county residents would benefit more from increased investments in recycling and stormwater to groundwater recapture than from the plant. Leon-Grossmann, too, said there are still plenty of other options on the table. 'We are still flushing toilets with drinking water,' she said, adding that building codes and retrofitting could make homes and businesses more water efficient. 'Just plugging the leaks could create more water than the desal plant can create.' Desalination shouldn't be seen as the simple solution, but rather the last resort, she argued. 'It is just not necessary,' Leon-Grossmann said. 'We are not saying never - we are just saying not right now.'", "0ab659d0830ebfb0ae7f5969e0999c277b446e8d78e9f0a4788cda5a": "After the bombshell leak of a supreme court draft opinion last week revealed that the majority of justices plan to overturn Roe v Wade, a handful of states have been reaffirming and expanding their abortion care. In recent days, a flurry of bills and statements have been emerging in largely Democratic-run states as lawmakers and organizations scramble to prepare for the possibility of a post-Roe America. As some states seek to become 'safe havens' for out-of-state abortion seekers, other states have been increasing abortion funding, expanding provider access and offering legal protections from lawsuits launched by citizen 'bounty-hunters' against those involved in abortions. Only 38% of women of reproductive age live in states that have shown support for abortion rights, according to the research organization Guttmacher Institute. In contrast, 58% live in states that have demonstrated hostility towards abortion rights. Only 4% of women live in middle-ground states. Last month, the New York state senator Liz Krueger introduced a bill that would shield New York doctors who offer abortion services to out-of-state patients by prohibiting law enforcement from cooperating with out-of-state investigations on abortion provisions. 'At this critical moment New York must ensure abortion access both to New Yorkers and refugees from other states who are being denied their basic rights,' Krueger told the Guardian. 'We must provide iron-clad protection for New York healthcare providers against abhorrent and regressive laws in other states,' she added. Similarly, Alessandra Biaggi, another New York state senator, introduced a bill that would create an abortion access fund and allow taxpayers to contribute to it. 'We created this bill to make sure that we were not just saying that people have a right to an abortion, but also that they have access to it because we know that simply by just saying the right does not mean that people have the means to do it,' Biaggi told the Guardian. In addition to transportation costs, the fund would cover childcare services, lodging, various medical expenses and other logistical support. Biaggi also introduced another bill that would offer out-of-state women who seek abortion or gender-affirming services the claim of 'unlawful interference' with their rights if they end up facing criminal or civil complaints. In Connecticut, Governor Ned Lamont signed a bill into law that will protect people who provide or receive abortion services in Connecticut and are then sued in another state. The first-in-the-nation law, which is set to take effect on 1 July, will also improve abortion access in Connecticut by expanding the type of practitioners eligible to perform certain abortion-related care. 'We want to make sure that we have the healthcare infrastructure to provide for not only our own residents, but also the folks who are going to be coming here for care,' state representative Matt Blumenthal, who co-sponsored the bill, said. As Connecticut is poised to become one of the country's few safe havens, lawmakers like Blumenthal are well aware of the challenges that will come with an uptick in out-of-state abortion seekers. 'A possible influx in out-of-state patients ... is definitely a concern. We've already seen individuals coming from Texas to get abortion care here in Connecticut and that was one of the reasons we wanted to expand the providers eligible to give the care,' he said. Blumenthal added, 'We got important sources of funding in our budget this year to protect reproductive healthcare in the state and that's very important because you know the people who are going to be affected by these bans in other states are going to be disproportionately people of low income, people of color who can't afford to travel freely.' Another state that has been weaving additional abortion care funds into its laws is Oregon. In February, the state legislature established the Reproductive Health Equity Fund which will allocate $15m to the non-profit Seeding Justice for expanded abortion access. Seeding Justice has described the fund, which will help Oregon brace for the abortion ban in neighboring Idaho, as a 'once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to invest in abortion access as a central part of Oregon's healthcare infrastructure'. 'These funds are meant to be holistic ...Those funds are really focused on patients get[ting] care and extending provider capacity,' An Do, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Oregon, said. Do continued, 'Within Oregon, we know that we need to be ramping up our healthcare infrastructure ... and shrinking the access desert ... so I think that is a big place to be able to make investments.' California has similarly positioned itself as 'a refuge state' of abortion rights. In January, the state legislature introduced a package of 13 bills to designate California as a sanctuary for abortion care. In addition to offering more legal protection to out-of-state patients and providers' privacy, the bills seek to expand the number of providers that are able to perform abortion services. One bill seeks to remove co-pays, deductibles and other cost-sharing requirements for abortions for all state-licensed health care service plans that are issued after 2022. Another bill would deny out-of-state subpoenas for patient information on reproductive health services that are granted in California. Other bills seek to protect California abortion providers by prohibiting the removal or suspension of medical licenses for a California licensee providing abortion care who is complying with state law. In Colorado, lawmakers are also rushing to codify abortion access protections. Colorado is one of the few states that does not require a 72-hour waiting period after abortion counseling. It also does not have any restrictions surrounding when in a pregnancy an abortion can take place. In April, Colorado's governor, Jared Polis, signed the Reproductive Health Equity Act, officially encoding the right to abortion into state law. According to the Colorado health department, 13% of the 10,400 abortion seekers who had the procedure in Colorado in 2020 were from out of state. As at least three of Colorado's immediate neighbors are certain or likely to ban abortion if Roe v Wade gets overturned, the state is preparing for an uptick in out-of-state abortion seekers, which may push Colorado residents further way to seek care. Greer Donley, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh who specializes in reproductive healthcare, told the Guardian, 'People will feel the effects of Roe being overturned, even if their state continues to allow abortion provision.' 'The primary way they will see these effects is through the wait times ... If half the states ban all or most abortions within the next few months, then the clinics in blue states will be inundated with patients traveling from out of state,' she said. As a result, Colorado clinics have vowed to do everything they can in order to expand access to abortion providers as they struggle with worker shortages, lengthy wait times and post-abortion complications. 'Capacity is critical. We know that clinics in access states are scheduling patients in weeks rather than days and they have added more exam rooms by consolidating offices and waiting areas. And opening new facilities is difficult, as is finding staff, since we are in a healthcare worker shortage,' said Elizabeth Nash, Guttmacher Institute's state policy expert. 'For patients, helping them pay for the abortion and abortion-related travel is key,' she added. In Maryland, lawmakers passed a bill last month that allows medical professionals other than physicians to perform abortions. The law will allow nurse practitioners, nurse midwives and trained physician assistants to carry out the procedure. In addition, the law will require the state to invest $3.5m annually in abortion-care training and will require the majority of insurance providers in the state to cover abortion costs. Last month, Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan filed a lawsuit in a state court that seeks to strike down the state's 1931 law that criminalizes abortions unless they are performed to protect a woman's life. The lawsuit also seeks to establish the right to an abortion in the state's constitution. Despite the various steps that progressive states have taken to expand abortion access, some still have certain restrictions in place that need to be removed to ensure abortion care is fully accessible. In addition to capacity problems, another significant restriction is costs. 'States need to look at how they help people pay for abortions, as we know that most patients pay out-of-pocket for their abortion,' Nash said. With at least 26 states poised to, likely or certain to ban abortions if Roe v Wade is overturned, the fight for abortion rights is more urgent than ever. 'I can't underscore how seismic a change this is,' said An Do. 'We never lost a constitutional right. This is just the beginning ... They [the justices] have written us all out of the constitution. What's next is marriage equality, what's next is so many people's access to birth control. 'We cannot be apathetic and we cannot lose ourselves into despair. We need to fight tooth and nail.'", "eac704331f379c193a86cba08db07cdf5f366c24b4aac3201083e1d7": "Sinthia Vee is not sure where her art supplies went. 'That's a big old question mark,' she said, sitting outside Tompkins Square Park in Manhattan's East Village neighborhood, on a recent sunny afternoon. It will rain soon. Vee said she was sitting in solidarity with others from New York's homeless community who - like her - had just had their encampments removed. A painter at heart whose only idea of her age is 'old enough to remember a lot of things from the 80s', Vee was now worrying about the medicine bags and art supplies she had kept in her tent that were now missing. 'I lost a bunch of things that day because it was insane and we moved around a lot.' She feared the medicine bags, like many other belongings of homeless people the city is trying to remove, were thrown in a compactor. This haze - of where things went, where things go - has become a common experience for those trying to survive the string of removal of homeless encampments across the city under its new Democratic mayor, Eric Adams. Adams is building up to keeping promises he made on the campaign trail on addressing the problem of homelessness by building more shelters. In recent years, New York City has seen a surge in homelessness: in February alone, there were nearly 50,000 people in the homeless shelters, whereas the total number of homeless people in shelters was only a little over double that number in all of 2021. During his campaign, Adams said that he would pair up police with mental health service providers to address homelessness, and that there is 'nothing dignified about sleeping on the streets'. But homeless advocates have slammed Adams's tactics as simply retreading old policies that have failed to meaningfully address the underlying problems causing homelessness and are, in fact, more geared to generating sympathetic headlines in the city's media. Johnny Grima, who has been on the streets since he was a teenager, has been on the frontlines of protests against the city's strict moves against homeless people since Adams became mayor in January. He said while every administration has controversial measures against homelessness, it's Adams's 'toxic' rhetoric on the issue that makes him stand out. 'I think fascism works like that - as soon as there's a tightening of the belt or any sort of shift into harder times, that fascist and oppressive elements within countries will immediately try to attack the most vulnerable,' he said. For the homeless, it's not just a loss of their homes but also a loss of their place of belonging and safety. Grima is among those who have been brutalized in his efforts to stop being removed. The first time he was arrested, the officials came and told him and his friends they could sleep there but would have to remove their tents. 'They ended up coming to the conclusion that we could sleep in the cold and wet so long as we didn't cover ourselves, [and] that we couldn't have a tent to protect ourselves from the elements,' he added. In late April, he would be arrested again, for the third time, for trying to hold down his tent during a raid. 'They threw me on my head,' he said. He was made to wear an ankle shackle at the hospital, and was cuffed to his bed for hours before he was taken to jail, where he stayed for 12 hours. The mayor's office said they don't authorize any arrests, but the New York police department (NYPD) is part of the multi-agency taskforce that is participating in the sweeps. The NYPD acknowledged the arrests in a statement, claiming most people from the community have been 'cooperative' and a 'small number' of people were arrested. 'There have been instances where individuals who have taken over public spaces to create encampments have interfered with city employees carrying out the clearing operations,' the agency said. 'In those cases a small number of people have been taken into custody and issued summonses.' Peter Malvan, a homeless advocate at the Safety Net Project of the Urban Justice Center, said even though a lot of people had their belongings organized and cleaned, their belongings weren't spared from being thrown away. 'Somebody's encampment looks like somebody's living room,' he said. 'All of that was trashed.' Mike Rodriguez, whose encampment was removed during the initial round from under the BQE bridge in Brooklyn, said he had already sorted out his and his partner's belongings when he got the notice. Their belongings, at least what they chose to hold on to, didn't get thrown out by the authorities. But it stings Rodriguez nonetheless, because there were things he and his partner, Parker Wolf, wanted to keep but had to throw out, including winter hats, sweaters and sneakers. They held on to their power outlets, cereal, peanut butter and jelly and some clothes. The mayor's office said because each encampment is given prior notice, the authorities remove the belongings when they arrive there and the location hasn't been cleared. For those whose belongings are thrown away, like Grima and Ver, the only option is to call 311 to report it. 'You just have to rebuild right away, and try to keep on living,' Grima said. Two days after Grima's arrest, the mayor's office announced a $171m addition to the budget to add more shelters and beds. But many advocates say Adams's focus on shelters as a solution doesn't make a difference for the community because shelters aren't an answer for them. As of 29 March, within 12 days of starting the crackdowns, city officials had visited 244 locations, and cleared 239 locations. Only five people accepted offers to move to a shelter. This is because most homeless people don't consider the shelters safe and some say the staff themselves can be hostile and abusive. 'The staff can say whatever they want - they call you names, belittle, threaten,' Grima said. 'They do this to senior citizens and disabled people.' Malvan echoed these experiences. He said people are 'passed around' from one shelter to another for 'advocating for themselves', and have been beaten by security. The mayor's office, in response to queries about the alleged abuse, said they are 'committed to prioritizing the safety of clients, staff and community members alike'. The homeless population was also particularly vulnerable during the pandemic, and putting them in shelters during this time, which the CDC recommended against, put them more at risk - as well as the public, Malvan said. At the shelters, people were made to live with about 20 others in a room, only two feet apart, he added. They were made to leave the shelters between 9am and 4pm, so they spent their days in public. 'It's like they actually created a situation where the pandemic could spread more and it affected everyone,' he said. New York City's homeless population outside shelters were significantly less affected by the pandemic than those in shelters during the first year of the pandemic. The population in shelters had 12 times the confirmed cases of Covid compared with those outside the shelters, and 17 times more deaths. The Black homeless community had the highest number of cases both in and out of shelters. Vee, Gima, Rodriguez and Wolf came from different generations and different parts of the country but they arrived at the same crossroad of a homeless policy that has upended their vulnerable lives. They all have different aspirations. Vee hopes to someday have her own art exhibition. Gima wants to have a #Me Too moment for the shelters that will expose their conditions. 'Hopefully we fight from the streets because it's not going to come from the top,' he said. Rodriguez and Wolf spend their days scrapping metals to earn a living and buy their food, while looking for a job. As it began pouring on a cloudy April afternoon, they stood protected under the BQE bridge and surrounded by piles of discarded items - cardboard boxes, a broken stroller, shopping carts and a solitary milk carton. Rodriguez looked around, getting ready to work. He'd have to start clearing the items under the bridge. 'After all,' he gestured towards one of the high-rises towering over the bridge, and shrugged, 'those guys pay $3,000 per month for the view, right?'", "e5616e7dff28bd981a7dbfe204e81f47ab58cd71711bf75d58ee1320": "", "fe5395eeaba0904b9ee4e9adf7f2b7b909f9b0c80312445767cdefac": "", "4e0d6aeb5b496e612391f2d642bdfc3575cf9a643ca7af0891a04a9d": "", "cf982e217a16074a9164438d0229aeeb2c565a0c644de10873c3b55a": "Asked whether the declaration will mean British boots on the ground in Finland, Johnson says the agreement is clear: The nature of that assistance will 'depend on the request of the other party', Johnson says.  The UK prime minister stresses that Nato is a 'defensive' alliance, adding: We will be pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine and returning in a few hours to bring you all the latest developments.  In the meantime, here is a comprehensive rundown of where things stand as of 3am in Kyiv.  Ukraine has claimed it has recaptured the town of Pytomnyk, north of Kharkiv and about halfway to the Russian border.  'We are having successes in the Kharkiv direction, where we are steadily pushing back the enemy and liberating population centres,' Brigadier General Oleksiy Hromov, Deputy Chief of the Main Operations Directorate of Ukraine's General Staff added. The war will end when Ukraine reclaims everything that Russia took from it, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has maintained. In an online address with students of leading universities in France, representatives of academia and the media, the president said: Zelenskiy also noted that the chances of ending the war through diplomacy decrease 'every time Russian troops commit heinous crimes against Ukrainians, as happened in Bucha and Mariupol'. Ukraine has said its military has destroyed pontoon bridges that Russian troops were using to cross a river in the eastern Luhansk region. The Ukrainian defence ministry published photos of what it said were destroyed Russian tanks and other armoury in the village of Bilohorivka, near the strategic Ukrainian-held city of Lysychansk.  Luhansk regional head Serhiy Haidai described Bilohorivka as a 'fortress' that - like the city of Mariupol - was 'holding back a great number' of Russian troops. Heavy fighting has been raging in the region for days. We have some footage of Finnish president, Sauli Niinisto, announcing his country's possible intention to join Nato. Finland is not yet a member of the intergovernmental military alliance, but Niinisto said joining would be to 'maximise security' and not be in any way offensive. Niinisto said Russia's invasion of Ukraine had pushed his government and country to think about its security. Niinisto was speaking at a joint news conference with the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, after signing a new security agreement that would involve Britain providing military assistance if Finland was attacked. - Leonie Chao-Fong, Guardian staff In his nightly address, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy celebrated the first US congressional passage of $40b in aid, as well as the approval of the Ukraine Lend-Lease Act.  He said:  He also celebrated Joe Biden's final approval of the Ukraine Lend-Lease Act today:  When Vladimir Putin stood up to speak at this week's Victory Day parade in Moscow's Red Square, there was an expectation - around the world and in Russia - that he would decisively seek to escalate the war in Ukraine towards a conclusion. But as Moscow correspondent Andrew Roth tells Michael Safi, Putin did nothing of the kind. He did not even claim the victories that were available to him - there were no announcements regarding defeated cities in Ukraine now under Russian control. Instead, he spoke of helping the military families who had sacrificed their sons to the conflict. The muted tone of the speech was revealing: it shows, says Roth, that Putin is faced with a dilemma that could make or break his presidency and his legacy in Russia. If he escalates the conflict he stands more chance of winning the kind of victory he initially hoped for. But should that fail, he would face humiliation. Alternatively, he could claim victory now and seek to de-escalate the conflict. But would a limited, compromised declaration of victory be regarded as anything but a retreat? The decision cannot be delayed indefinitely. Russia's elite fighting units are nearing exhaustion. And the limited 'operation' does not yet allow for a full-scale mobilisation. But there is growing recognition in Moscow and elsewhere that Ukraine's fighters should not be underestimated. Putin does not hold all the aces in this conflict. Listen to the podcast:  Final congressional approval of a $40bn Ukraine aid bill in the United States seems certain within days as top US Senate Republicans said Wednesday they expect strong backing from their party for the measure already passed by the House of Representatives, the Associated Press reports. The No 2 Republican in the Senate, John Thune of South Dakota predicted 'a big vote over here' for the bill, which he and others suggested might come Thursday but could spill into next week. Thune said some Republicans would vote against it and procedural tactics by opponents to slow it were possible, but added: It's taken just two weeks for lawmakers to receive president Joe Biden's smaller, $33bn package, enlarge it and move it to the brink of passage - lightning speed for Congress. That reflects a bipartisan consensus that Ukraine's outnumbered forces need additional Western help as soon as possible, with added political pressure fueled by near-daily tales of atrocities against civilians inflicted by Russian president Vladimir Putin's armies.

British defence secretary Ben Wallace is talking to reporters about Russia while on a visit to Washington DC. Wallace is also busy dissing Russian weapons. And he claims that China appears to be increasingly embarrassed by Russia's conduct of its war in Ukraine, with Beijing regarding Moscow as an 'inconvenient friend', according to this FP report. Ben Wallace and Lloyd Austin looking on as a military display takes place at the Pentagon. Strong images continue to emerge from Mariupol of the destruction wrought by occupying Russian forces, which continue to besiege the Azovstal steel complex, where Ukrainian forces are holding out in dire straits. Mariupol Ukraine has proposed to Russia that badly injured defenders in the Azovstal steel plant in the southern port of Mariupol be swapped for Russian prisoners of war, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on Wednesday, Reuters reports. We'll bring you more details when we have them. Conditions in the besieged steel works, Ukraine's last stand in Mariupol, have been appalling both for Ukrainian military coming under heavy fire and attacks from the Russians and Ukrainian civilians hiding and recently evacuated from the huge, labyrinthine complex that has several floors below ground. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he had spoken to German chancellor Olaf Scholz and discussed defensive aid, energy sector cooperation and increasing sanctions on Russia as an invading force, Reuters now reports. The Ukrainian president said the two talked about such matters in relation to 'the Russian aggressor'. 'We appreciate the high level of dialogue' with Germany, he tweeted, using a German flag emoji to represent the country, and 'support in our struggle'. Zelenskiy had previously invited Scholz to make a powerful political statement by visiting Kyiv on 9 May, the day German leaders have often travelled to Moscow to mark Russia's Victory Day commemoration of the defeat of Nazi Germany in the second world war. That particular visit did not take place and Scholz instead was in Berlin, accompanied by French president Emmanuel Macron, where the Brandenburg Gate was illuminated in the colours of the Ukrainian flag as a mark of support.  Reuters notes that Scholz had been reluctant to visit Ukraine since Kyiv was unwilling to receive German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Steinmeier is unpopular in Kyiv because he is associated there with an earlier German policy of pursuing close trade and other ties with Vladimir Putin's Russia. Germany's foreign minister Annalena Baerbock visited Ukraine yesterday (10 May) as the highest-ranking German government official to visit the country since Russia's invasion began on 24 February.

The Russian-controlled administration in the Ukrainian city of Kherson has said it plans to request annexation by Moscow, a move that would confirm the Kremlin's permanent occupation of Ukrainian territory captured since February. If Russia attempts to annex the Kherson region it would make a peace agreement more unlikely, as Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said that Russia's withdrawal to prewar positions was a precondition for any successful negotiation. It is not clear whether the Kremlin will go forward with an annexation or is using it as a threat to put pressure on Kyiv. The annexation call was made on Wednesday by Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the military administration Russia put in place to run Kherson in late April. Russia occupied Kherson in March and seized its city council building in late April. 'The city of Kherson is Russia; there will be no the KNR [Kherson People's Republic] on the territory of the Kherson region, there will be no referendums,' said Stremousov in a televised briefing.  Stremousov previously said that Kherson would begin using the rouble currency, a move seen as creeping integration into Russia. Russian officials who have visited Kherson have promised not to abandon the region. 'Russia is here to stay forever,' said Andrei Turchak, secretary general of Russia's ruling United Russia party, while visiting Kherson last week. 'There should be no doubt about it. There will be no return to the past.' But similar requests for annexation from territories such as the Russian-controlled Donetsk People's Republic have languished for years, as the Kremlin has dangled integration while seeking to put pressure on Kyiv. Here's more on Helskini's decision on whether to apply for Nato membership. A former Finnish prime minister, Alexander Stubb, said Finland is 99.9% likely to join the alliance. Speaking to the BBC, Stubb said the Finnish president will announce the country's intention to join tomorrow, followed by an announcement over the weekend, and a joint statement from Finland and Sweden early next week. There is 'overwhelming support' in Finland for joining Nato, Stubb said, citing a poll earlier this week which showed 76% in favour and 12% against. Stubb, who served as prime minister from 2014 to 2015, said: He said Finland is 'not at all' worried about Russia's threat of 'a military-technical response' if it joins the alliance, adding that when Iceland, Denmark and Norway joined in 1949 'the rhetoric was similar'. But he warned that Finland could be vulnerable to Russian intimidation, cyber attacks and disinformation during the 'grey zone' of the membership application process.", "a1c998d0c3a0744f0c1516cc5c5b076ad38a24016d1a3eb8a0436356": "Russian and Ukrainian forces appear to be settling into a gruelling and deadly stalemate in Ukraine's east, amid warnings from a senior US military official that neither side can win in the present circumstances. Despite an announcement from Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that Ukrainian counter-offensives around the city of Kharkiv were pushing invading Russian forces back, Ukrainian successes appeared to be confined for now to the far north-eastern and south-western flanks of the 300-mile frontline. Further south-east, along the frontline in the Donbas region, Russian forces have deployed a relentless artillery barrage and managed to take some territory. Ukrainian forces announced their retreat from the city of Popasna at the weekend. Severodonetsk, the easternmost city still held by Ukrainian forces, is virtually surrounded and the last parts of Luhansk region not under Russian control are within range of its heavy artillery. In towns and cities near the frontline, constant Russian shelling and bomb and missile attacks on civilian targets have largely emptied the streets. They include a weekend strike on a school in Bilohorivka thought to have killed at least 60 people. The government urged those who could to evacuate areas that may experience heavy fighting, and though tens of thousands of people unable or unwilling to leave are still in their homes, they venture out into the streets only for essential errands. On Wednesday, rocket strikes hit two districts of Slovyansk city, Vadym Lyakh, head of the city administration, said. Russian forces also shelled civilian buildings in the town of Bakhmut, around 30 miles south, authorities there said.  'The Russians aren't winning, and the Ukrainians aren't winning, and we're at a bit of a stalemate here,' said Lt Gen Scott Berrier, director of the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency, who gave evidence on Tuesday alongside Avril Haines, the US national intelligence director, to the Senate armed forces committee. The assessment was delivered as the Russian military claimed its forces had advanced as far as the border between the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, potentially edging to securing control of the Donbas region despite losing ground around Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. Zelenskiy said in his nightly address on Tuesday that he had 'good news' from Kharkiv. 'The occupiers are gradually being pushed away,' he said. 'I am grateful to all our defenders who are holding the line and demonstrating truly superhuman strength to drive out the army of invaders.' The tenuous nature of the advances was highlighted by the head of the Kharkiv regional state administration, Oleg Synegubov, who conceded that, while the four villages had been retaken, fierce battles were still raging. Tetiana Apatchenko, a spokesperson for the 92nd Separate Mechanised Brigade, the main Ukrainian force in the area, confirmed that Ukrainian troops had in recent days recaptured the settlements of Cherkaski Tyshky, Ruski Tyshki, Borshchova and Slobozhanske, in a pocket north of Kharkiv. Russia and Ukraine have made inflated claims about their successes, with assessments from western defence and intelligence officials in recent weeks often painting a more subdued picture. On Wednesday, the latest update from the UK's Ministry of Defence pinpointed the continuing struggle for Zmiinyi Island as increasingly crucial for Russian efforts to dominate the Black Sea. The MoD said: 'Fighting continues at Zmiinyi Island, also known as Snake Island, with Russia repeatedly trying to reinforce its exposed garrison located there. 'Ukraine has successfully struck Russian air defences and resupply vessels with Bayraktar drones. Russia's resupply vessels have minimum protection in the western Black Sea, following the Russian navy's retreat to Crimea after the loss of the Moskva. 'Russia's current efforts to augment its forces on Zmiinyi Island offer Ukraine more opportunities to engage Russian troops and 'attrit materiel'. If Russia consolidates its position on Zmiinyi Island with strategic air defence and coastal defence cruise missiles, they could dominate the north-western Black Sea.' Recent aerial images from the island following Ukrainian drone attacks showed columns of smoke from Russian positions. A Russian landing craft hit close to the island at the weekend appeared to have been involved in efforts to reinforce Russian troops there. Graphically underlining the grim nature of the fighting, the press service of the Azov brigade, a Ukrainian unit that has historical far-right affiliations and which is trapped by Russian forces inside the Azovstal steel mill in Mauripol, released images of wounded soldiers, many missing limbs and being cared for in unsanitary conditions. Warnings of a 'prolonged war' not least from Haines in her testimony to Senate members, has come amid a mounting recognition in western capitals that both Moscow and Kyiv are increasingly bound by more maximalist war aims, making a negotiated end to the fighting complicated. With many analysts viewing any backing down by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, over the refocused Russian campaign in the south and east of the country as political suicide, Kyiv appeared to be insisting that its war aims now included regaining territory lost in 2014. In an interview with the Financial Times, the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said Ukraine initially believed victory would be the withdrawal of Russian troops to positions they occupied before the invasion. 'Now if we are strong enough on the military front, and we win the battle for Donbas, which will be crucial for the following dynamics of the war, of course the victory for us in this war will be the liberation of the rest of our territories.'", "c97e47de0b6d840b229957f11d4c4ba256d0e6208bf94f4e77d45c0c": "Vladimir Putin could view the prospect of defeat in Ukraine as an existential threat to his regime, potentially triggering his resort to using a nuclear weapon, the top US intelligence official has warned. The warning on Tuesday came in an assessment from intelligence chiefs briefing the Senate on worldwide threats. The prediction for Ukraine was a long, gruelling war of attrition, which could lead to increasingly volatile acts of escalation from Putin, including full mobilisation, the imposition of martial law, and - if the Russian leader felt the war was going against him, endangering his position in Moscow - even the use of a nuclear warhead. The grim forecast came on a day of continued fighting in the east and south of Ukraine, and Russian missile attacks on the port of Odesa, with the UN conceding that the civilian death toll from the war will probably be far higher than the current official estimate of 3,381. The director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, told the Senate armed services committee that Putin would continue to brandish Russia's nuclear arsenal in an attempt to deter the US and its allies from further support for Ukraine. The shift of focus to the east and the south are most likely a temporary tactic rather than a permanent scaling back of war aims, she said. The Russian leader would not use a nuclear weapon until he saw an existential threat to Russia or his regime, Haines argued. But she added that he could view the prospect of defeat in Ukraine as constituting such a threat. 'We do think that [Putin's perception of an existential threat] could be the case in the event that he perceives that he is losing the war in Ukraine, and that Nato in effect is either intervening or about to intervene in that context, which would obviously contribute to a perception that he is about to lose the war in Ukraine,' Haines told the committee hearing. She added that the world would probably have some warning that nuclear use was imminent. 'There are a lot of things that he would do in the context of escalation before he would get to nuclear weapons, and also that he would be likely to engage in some signaling beyond what he's done thus far before doing so,' Haines said. That signaling could include a further large-scale nuclear exercise involving the substantial dispersal of mobile intercontinental missiles, heavy bombers and strategic submarines. The assessment the US intelligence chiefs laid out for the senators suggested that Ukraine was faced with the prospect of a war of attrition. They said Putin intended to conquer the Luhansk and Donetsk regions plus a buffer zone around them, to secure a land bridge to Crimea. He wanted to hold Kherson, north of Crimea, to secure the water supply to the peninsula. However, his ambitions did not stop there. Haines said there were 'indications' that Putin wants to extend the land bridge as far as Transnistria, the Moscow-occupied region of Moldova, thereby controlling all of Ukraine's Black Sea coast. Haines said, however, that Putin would face an uphill task, and that the extension of the land bridge to Transnistria, including the capture of Odesa, would not be possible without a full mobilisation. She added that the capture of the Donbas plus a buffer zone was unlikely in the next few weeks. The head of the Defence Intelligence Agency, Lt Gen Scott Berrier, said that the US believed that between eight and 10 Russian generals had been killed so far in the conflict. Like Haines, Berrier predicted a stalemate, with neither side able to achieve a breakthrough. But a decision by Putin to order a full mobilisation in Russia, ushered in by a formal declaration of war, could change the military balance. 'If they do mobilise, and they do declare war, that'll bring thousands more soldiers to the fight,' Berrier said. 'And even though they may not be as well trained and competent, they will still bring mass and a lot more ammunition.' Despite all the setbacks, Haines said Putin was probably convinced that Russia ultimately had more stamina than Ukraine and its backers. 'He is probably counting on the US and EU resolve to weaken as food shortages, inflation and energy prices get worse,' she said. Given Putin's conviction he could ultimately prevail, and the fact that Ukraine showed no signs of giving in, Haines said US intelligence agencies 'do not see a viable negotiating path forward, at least in the short term'. Meanwhile, as the war of attrition continued, the conflict was likely to take 'a more unpredictable and potentially escalatory trajectory'. 'The current trend increases the likelihood that President Putin will turn to more drastic means, including imposing martial law, reorienting industrial production, or potentially escalatory military actions to free up the resources needed to achieve his objectives as the conflict drags on, or if he perceives Russia is losing in Ukraine,' Haines said. The most likely flashpoint in the coming weeks, she added, would be escalating Russian attempts to intimidate the west to stop weapons supplies into Ukraine and possible retaliation for western economic sanctions or perceived threats to Putin's regime at home.", "59e64f261d674e8f34809b7ed56d8147f4647aaf5f8c7d77b6df7365": "", "f11ec1a5584af3a6cb03274d011e1b9ce8a06034d25a968b5f139eb4": "The longer the war in Ukraine carries on, the worse the consequences will be for the climate, the US presidential envoy John Kerry has warned. Many countries are struggling with an energy crisis while also urgently needing to cut greenhouse gas emissions to limit global heating to 1.5C, he said. 'If it's a long period of time, obviously that makes [staying within 1.5C] very complicated,' Kerry said. 'It depends on what happens with the war, where the war goes and how long it lasts. If miraculously we can somehow find a way to resolve some of the fundamental problems in the next six months, then maybe we could just accelerate everything together. I think we can make up some distance [in progress on tackling the climate crisis].' But he added: 'The longer this goes on, the harder it becomes [to stay within 1.5C]. There are a number of scientists who believe we are on the edge of 1.5C now. Anything that is not part of the acceleration [of emissions-cutting efforts] gets in the way.' He said the agreement reached at the UN Cop26 climate summit last year would have 'faced some big hurdles' if taking place in the current geopolitical circumstances, but there was still a chance of fulfilling its promises. 'This is not easy, but it hasn't fallen apart,' he told the Guardian. '[The effort to stay within 1.5C] has met with an unexpected barrier, the war, and it has met with an unfortunate and dangerous resurgence of business as usual by some parties that threatens the acceleration necessary to get the job done, and it's going to be up to us to push back and continue with the process.' The world's leading climate scientists recently warned it was 'now or never' for the world to cut greenhouse gas emissions and avoid the worst ravages of the climate crisis. Kerry said this showed there was still a chance of holding to the 1.5C goal. 'The IPCC said to us a few weeks ago 'we're behind, it's not getting better at the pace it should be, emissions have gone up, but you still have time to do this',' he said. 'And my message to people is we have to take advantage of the fact that the science tells us we still have time, but we have to greatly accelerate what we're doing. We have to speed up very significantly.' He said the disruption caused by the Ukraine war was forcing countries to reconsider their dependence on fossil fuels. 'The promises of Cop26 were never going to be fulfilled in six months, or one year or two years. These are promises for 2030. A hiccup of a number of months may be something that we can work around or get through.' Kerry also said the US would increase its production of natural gas, despite its climate targets, to help allies replace Russian fossil fuels. He said gas from the US produced lower carbon emissions than gas from Russia, owing to more efficient extraction, and could provide a short-term solution while countries ramp up renewable energy. The US president, Joe Biden, has come under heavy criticism from green campaigners in the US for allowing the expansion of gas drilling, opening up new tracts of public land for exploration and development. Kerry said more gas was needed in the short term, to make up for supplies lost from Russia, but that companies should beware of building large amounts of new gas infrastructure that would be left as stranded assets when the energy crisis passes. 'Gas has always been part of the transition away from dirtier fossil fuels and towards this new energy economy,' he said. 'I'd take a gas-fired power plant in the near term - I emphasise near term - over coal or oil any day of the week. But we don't want to build out a huge new infrastructure around gas that has stranded asset challenges or is unabated [not fitted with technology to capture and store carbon] after a number of years.' He hinted at moves to limit how long such plants could operate. 'We have to decide how quickly we must have a requisite for abatement - maybe 10 years, eight years, who knows? But for the long run, gas is going to have to abate and live up to low emissions standards just like everybody else,' he said. With six months to go before the next UN climate summit, Cop27 in Egypt, Kerry said the focus must be on the G20 countries, the world's 20 biggest economies, which are responsible for about 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The emissions-cutting plans these countries brought to Cop26 were inadequate to meet the 1.5C target, so they have been asked to come to Egypt this November with more stringent proposals. Kerry acknowledged that many countries were unlikely to meet the targets, including Russia, which is one of the biggest fossil fuel producers. He warned some countries were 'indifferent' to the need to cut emissions, or have vested interests in not doing so. 'The war is not the only thing that's in the way of the acceleration - an unfortunate indifference in some quarters, outright disinformation in others, and people who just love the status quo is perhaps one of our biggest problems,' he said. But there were hopes that major emitters including China and India were embracing change, he added. 'We're prepared to try to help China or provide whatever China is willing to accept in terms of assistance.' He also pointed to India, currently suffering a massive heatwave, where a large expansion of renewable energy is planned that could enable the country to cut emissions in line with a global 1.5C temperature goal. Kerry said he was hopeful that the climate legislation currently stuck in Congress, largely because of the refusal of a single Democratic senator to pass it, would soon be resolved. He said other countries were unlikely to be discouraged from taking action themselves by the US's own internal difficulties. 'Maybe they'll say 'screw them, they can't get their act together, we're going to do it',' he said. 'I can't predict, but I can tell you this: that President Biden is committed to moving forward and obviously he has administrative powers and can issue certain executive orders and do certain things. 'Even while Donald Trump was president, pulled out of Paris, 75% of the new power that came online in the US was renewable. So the truth is that a lot of what happens in the US will be governed locally and some nationally by governors of states and mayors of cities who are deeply committed.'", "26add2cb6bbef802a3a21b2d131e9481ae3b3f62bc34b16149dcee22": "The bitter feud would almost be comical were it not being waged in the devastated Ukrainian town of Borodyanka, north of Kyiv, among hollowed out buildings, burned armoured vehicles and freshly dug graves. A near two-decade grudge between two priests, fuelled by fierce interchurch tensions and the pursuit of local dominance, has escalated into tit-for-tat claims of attempted murder, treachery, collaboration in forced deportations and vigilante vandalism. An uncomfortable introduction as younger men 18 years ago and a few awkward moments at local community events have spiralled, local people say, into each threatening God's judgment on the other. The chief accuser of the two is Father Dmytro Koshka, rector at the Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin, of the Orthodox church of Ukraine. It is not to be confused with the Moscow-affiliated Ukrainian Orthodox church, for which the accused, Father Viktor Talko, is an archpriest. Koshka, 42, sitting in the shade of his church's porch as a line of local people waited to be handed spare clothes, food and water by volunteers, said he believed Talko, 67, at the Church of Archangel Michael, a short drive down Lesi Ukrainky boulevard, had directed Russian soldiers to hunt him down at the height of their occupation on 2 March. 'I received a call from the territorial defence fighters because I am also a member of the Borodyanka territorial defence,' Koshka said. 'They said they were asking me to leave my house because the Moscow father had received Russian soldiers and cooperated with them.' Koshka said he left the next day for the sake of his wife, Mariya, 41, and daughter, Angelina, 18, for Piskivka, a village 15 miles north-west of Borodyanka. 'The territorial defence told me that when Russian soldiers came to the church to look for me, they showed everyone all my personal data, even my passport data. They had all the information about me,' he said. 'I used to be a deputy of the city council. And this is access to public information about me. But Russian soldiers, they would never have found it themselves, they were helped by the Russian priest. He gave them all this information ... I know him very well.' Koshka, who did not offer any evidence for his claims, went on: 'He gave [the Russian soldiers] shelter in his church. He then stationed their military equipment on his farm. His own son helped to do it. After that, he prepared food for them, fed them, they spent the night there. In short, he met them as his close friends. Everyone knows about it and everyone has seen it.' The gravest crime, Koshka said, however, was that Talko allowed his church to be part of a 'trick' on people desperate to escape the shelling in the town. Local people received a text message from an anonymous number inviting them to meet at Talko's church to be evacuated - but they had not been told that their destination was Russia-allied Belarus, it is claimed. 'The SBU [Ukrainian secret services] is dealing with him because he helped to smuggle people to Belarus, more than 100 people,' Koshka said. 'They had tried to escape. He, his son, his family got into a minibus and started running. But one bridge was blown up, another bridge was blown up and in third place was the Ukrainian army. And they were trapped, they had nowhere to run.' Talko was, he added, not a priest but a 'wolf in sheep's clothing'. A five minute drive away, Talko, sitting among the cherry trees and blackberry bushes in the pretty grounds of his own church, angrily denied most of the claims and all of Koshka's interpretation of the events during the Russian occupation, calling his fellow priest 'spiritually ill' and saying he was seeking to stir up enmity. Talko said he was being unfairly accused of being an agent of the Russian army owing to the historical links between his denomination and Moscow, shaking his head as he spoke. He denied running away, saying he was picked up by the Ukrainian secret services on 2 April, the day after Russian forces left, and interrogated for six days in a gymnasium in Kyiv. Talko said he had only ever tried to help local people by asking for flour from the Russians and denied giving the invaders information about Koshka. 'I have no problems with the Ukrainian government,' said Talko, who has led his church in Borodyanka for 30 years. 'They accuse me of allegedly collaborating with the Russian occupation forces. Everything I did as a priest, as a clergyman. I turned to Russian soldiers only for help for Ukrainian civilians. 'I did not feed Russian soldiers either. We fed ordinary civilians. We asked for flour from Russian soldiers to bake bread for people in our church. And the Ukrainian authorities cannot understand how this is so - the enemy helped the Ukrainian priest. Ukrainian authorities now portray Russian soldiers as terrible. But in reality, the Russian soldiers here were different.' Grasping what he said was a letter of thanks from a Borodyanka family who had since moved and were uncontactable, Talko said people had been grateful for his help in getting them to Belarus. 'Please see what letters people wrote to me whom I helped to evacuate to Belarus,' he said. 'They are grateful to me for that. We helped evacuate our Ukrainian people through the Belarusian Red Cross. We asked for the Belarusian Red Cross and they evacuated people to Belarus. 'Our church helped evacuate 80 people to Belarus. And we also helped evacuate people to western Ukraine. We helped evacuate 1,500 people to western Ukraine.' Koshka's church had been formed merely to challenge his own, Talko said, adding that he believed Koshka had encouraged people to throw molotov cocktails into an outhouse by the gates to his church's estate. 'Here you see a burnt building near the church?' he asked. 'It was all organised by this priest. He is now a 'star and a patriot'. God bless him.' He added: 'The first time we met, he approached me with such a strange expression on his face. I told him - never get in my way again. If I was not a priest I would be talking to him differently now. I used to wrestle and do sports. Let God judge him.'", "60b9a1cc45fc8b79a8192f3b7a89d8dcd2690e7b28563fe79bb00555": "The lifting of zero-Covid policies in China would see a 'tsunami' of infections and almost 1.6 million deaths, a study claims, citing in part China's low vaccination rate of elderly residents. China's government remains committed to a zero-Covid policy, employing resource intensive mass testing and case surveillance, and enforcing lockdowns, strict quarantine and isolation. A speech last week by the president, Xi Jinping, reaffirmed the commitment, despite the challenge posed by the Omicron variant which has already overwhelmed other countries' zero-Covid policies. The peer reviewed study by Shanghai's Fudan University, published in the Nature journal, said a decision by Chinese authorities to lift such measures could see more than 112 million symptomatic cases of Covid-19, five million hospitalisations, and 1.55 million deaths. 'We find that the level of immunity induced by the March 2022 vaccination campaign would be insufficient to prevent an Omicron wave that would result in exceeding critical care capacity with a projected intensive care unit peak demand of 15.6 times the existing capacity,' the paper said. However it also said that with access to vaccines and antivirals and 'maintaining implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions', authorities could prevent the health system being overwhelmed. It suggested these factors could be more of a focus in future policies. While the government message is that the zero-Covid policy will prevail over the highly transmissible variant, health officials have said they cannot open up now because vaccine coverage is insufficient and health resources too uneven across the country. Health experts agree, but China analysts are also concerned the authorities have backed themselves into a corner with no political exit ramp for the policy without admitting failure. Case numbers are dropping in China but remain spread across multiple provinces. On Wednesday authorities reported 1,905 cases including 302 symptomatic. The bulk of cases are still being found in Shanghai, which has been under lockdown for more than two months. On Tuesday authorities announced new guidelines for people to home quarantine. Part of the change specified that among other requirements, the homes must have ventilation and drainage systems that 'won't contaminate those of other households', a report in the Global Times said. Other requirements include separate bathrooms and bedrooms, and the ability to care for oneself - in line with home isolation arrangements in other countries. However the prospect of allowing some asymptomatic people and close contacts to stay home has ignited debate among epidemiologists and health officials, and comes in stark contrast to the enforcement of measures on the ground, especially in Shanghai. Since Xi's speech last week, enforcement in the city appears to have hardened further. Social media is awash with videos of health workers and police officers in full protective equipment zealously enforcing regulations. There appears to be growing frustration with how the rules and regulations are being enforced, with many questioning how it compares to recent moves by authorities to take people into quarantine facilities if they live on the same or an adjoining floor as a confirmed case. Shanghai authorities on Tuesday said officials were making judgments and risk assessments on a case by case basis. 'The policy is policy, the implementation is implementation, the two are separate,' said one commenter. Another said his girlfriend's parents were taken away and the whole residence isolated despite them not sharing communal areas with a nearby case. 'My girlfriend's parents - two veteran party members who have been party members for more than 40 years - can't help but cry, and they can't figure out whether there is a unified policy.' On Tuesday the WHO's director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said his organisation did not think China's zero-Covid policy was 'sustainable considering the behaviour of the virus'. 'We have discussed about this issue with Chinese experts and we indicated that the approach will not be sustainable ... I think a shift would be very important,' he said.", "79681761f737a680b2498118e44549c93be718af64d65525f2197482": "From a stage in the heart of Silicon Valley, London mayor Sadiq Khan called on tech companies to rein in hate speech, speaking about his own experience of abuse amplified by one of the most powerful figures on social media. He was referencing Donald Trump, who frequently used the mayor as an online punching bag, calling Khan 'a stone-cold loser' and 'very dumb'. Khan, whose family are from Pakistan, said the amount of racial abuse he received on social media increased by 2,000% under Trump and required him to receive police protection. 'The worst thing globalization has brought to social media is the proliferation of hate speech,' said Khan, speaking at Stanford University as part of his first visit to the US since the pandemic began. Khan emphasized the power that companies have to act, saying that in the year after Twitter banned Trump over his role in inciting the attack at the US Capitol, he received 'the least racial abuse of any time over five years'. Abuse directed at Khan declined by 75% in 2020, the year Trump lost the election, and a further 40% in 2021 after the ban from Twitter, according to statistics from London's city hall. The speech came just hours after Elon Musk, who is poised to take over Twitter, announced he would allow the former US president to return to the platform. Khan stopped short of condemning Musk's plans, saying he believes 'passionately in freedom of speech' and trusts that those who lead Twitter will 'make sure that you aren't seeing messages that are inciting hatred, that are amplifying division'. 'The question is whether Donald Trump has learned his lesson,' Khan said. 'Everybody should be entitled to be rehabilitated. And if it's the case that Donald Trump is going to use Twitter in a responsible way, then it's all well and good. But if he breaks the rules, there needs to be consequences.' Musk has been vocal about his plans for Twitter after he revealed on 4 April he had become a majority stakeholder in the company and then rapidly negotiated a deal to buy the company for $44bn. He called the decision to ban Trump 'morally bad' and 'foolish in the extreme'. Khan called on tech companies on Tuesday to 'act rationally' and introduce new algorithmic measures to preemptively crack down on hate speech and misinformation. He called the current landscape 'lawless'. 'On the one hand, social media, Facebook, Twitter - great,' he said. 'On the other hand, [the abuse] is the consequence of a lack of control and lack of regulation.' Earlier in the day, Khan spoke from a startup funding center on how Brexit has threatened London's standing as a growing tech hub, and said his mission in California was, in part, to encourage links between Silicon Valley and London. Khan acknowledged the UK's decision to leave the EU threatened to erase the 'huge advantages' of having a single market - one that allows free movement of goods, services and talent. 'We have seen some flight, and that is one of the reasons why I'm in the USA banging the drum for London - we can't be complacent,' he said in an interview with the Guardian. The referendum result has led many companies to flee the UK: more than 440 financial firms left the country after 2016, one 2021 study showed, and those that stayed are facing increasingly confusing fees and paperwork for international trade. However, London has attracted more international tech investment than any other global city, Khan said, citing a study from the promotional group London & Partners. From 2017 to 2021, London saw 251 US tech companies set up there, creating almost 9,000 new jobs, the same study showed. But while statistics show that the 'worst fears' have not materialized, Khan said, the new landscape has underscored the need to keep pushing forward. 'We have to understand post Brexit that we live in a very competitive world,' he said. 'We have to show our strength is not just the tech, but the geography, higher education, and more. That attracts people to come in the first place and keeps them there as well.'", "46703cd8b427cd60f5bff752b2af706dc591f302a46148c4dd447ba7": "Coldplay have been branded 'useful idiots for greenwashing' after announcing a partnership with the Finnish oil company Neste to halve their touring emissions last week. Neste claims to be the world's largest producer of sustainable biofuels, but the firm's palm oil suppliers cleared at least 10,000 hectares (24,710 acres) of forest in countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia between 2019 and 2020, according to a study by Friends of the Earth. Carlos Calvo Ambel, a senior director of the Transport and Environment campaign group (T&E) said: 'Neste is cynically using Coldplay to greenwash its reputation. This is a company that is linked to the kind of deforestation that would appal Chris Martin and his fans. It's not too late, they should drop their partnership with Neste now and focus on truly clean solutions instead.' 'Coldplay's commitment to reduce its emissions is no doubt well-intentioned. But teaming up with a company linked to deforestation makes them useful idiots for greenwashing.' The award-winning rock outfit announced plans to shrink their touring footprint after Martin accepted that a 'backlash' against their emissions record was justified in a BBC interview last year. A tree will be planted for each ticket sold on Coldplay's current 'music of the spheres' world tour, which includes a kinetic-powered dancefloor and other green features. A statement from the band said: 'When we announced this tour, we said that we would try our best to make it as sustainable and low carbon-impact as possible, but that it would be a work in progress. That remains true. We don't claim to have got it all right yet.' 'Before we appointed Neste as supplier of these biofuel products, we received their guarantee that they do not use any virgin materials in their production - most especially not palm oil. It's still our understanding that they use renewable waste products only, like cooking oil and byproducts from wood pulp manufacture.' Hanna Leijala, a spokeswoman for Neste, insisted that the firm 'do not accept any sustainability violations in our own operations.' 'For our collaboration with Coldplay, conventional palm oil was not used as a raw material' she said, adding: 'Neste plans to reduce the share of conventional palm oil to 0% of its global renewable raw material inputs by the end of 2023.' At present, crude palm oil makes up 7% of the firm's fuel inputs. Its jet fuel is blended from used cooking oil, animal fats and other wastes and residues. But Neste declined to say what percentage of the jet fuel mix is made up by palm fatty acid distillates (PFADs), citing 'contractual and competitive reasons.' PFADs are considered a byproduct of palm oil refining by the UK, Germany and most EU countries, but not by Finland. T&E argues that it is 'dubious' to consider used cooking oil as sustainable when studies suggest that most EU supplies are imports from countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia and China. Higher EU prices for used cooking oil incentivises adulteration and EU auditors have criticised Europe's capacity to verify the source of these imports. The use of animal fats also raises questions of agricultural methane emissions, as most fats come from industrial farming, T&E says. Coldplay's world tour has been separately criticised for collaborating with BMW, which is providing 40 rechargeable electric vehicle batteries to power the shows. BMW is an influential lobbyist for the German car industry, according to a report by Influence Map. 'Coldplay have been taken for a ride,' said Eoin Dubsky, the senior campaign manager for Sum Of Us. 'BMW is lobbying to prevent the EU from setting a deadline of 2035 for vehicles to be zero emissions only and they have been able to use Coldplay.' The band's statement said that they had approached other electric car manufacturers but 'BMW were the ones that offered to help'. 'We have no connection to or influence on their corporate policies,' the release continued. 'We just need their batteries so that we can power our shows with renewable energy.' 'We are doing our best, and always genuinely welcome suggestions as to how to do it better,' the band said. Dubsky was sympathetic to their predicament. 'Not many rock bands hire in a sustainability consultant, so credit to them,' he said. 'But I think that they should take greater care when doing their due diligence,' he added.", "2e22ea3b0041603d29fa054da2bd8dc40c4000808b36674f27311fd6": "Boris Johnson was accused of being 'bereft of ideas or purpose,' after a Queen's speech that included 38 new bills but offered no specific measures to tackle the immediate cost of living crisis. Instead, the speech, delivered by the Prince of Wales amid the pomp of the state opening of parliament, included plans to tear up the Human Rights Act, make it harder for councils to rename streets and privatise Channel 4. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said the speech showed the government had no guiding principle, while Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, was equally withering. 'British politics is out of ideas,' he said. 'Further action has been promised on the cost of living, but there certainly wasn't any in the Queen's speech. It rightly highlighted the need for growth - the essential precondition for ending our living standards stagnation - but did little to actually bring it about.' With the Queen unable to give the address for the first time in almost 60 years, Prince Charles began by saying: 'Her Majesty's government's priority is to grow and strengthen the economy and help ease the cost of living for families'. However, Johnson's programme for the new parliamentary session included a string of well-trailed and controversial plans, including banning disruptive protests and preventing universities from no-platforming speakers; but few new policies likely to boost the economy in the short term. Instead, the government emphasised help it had already provided, including the temporary energy bill rebate and the cut to the universal credit taper rate. Government sources claimed two-thirds of the planned new laws were aimed at boosting economic growth in the medium and long-term, pointing to the energy security bill, which aims to open up the market for new technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture. Johnson said the country had 'risen to challenges with no precedent in recent history' including the Covid-19 pandemic and vaccine rollout, as well as Vladimir Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine, the UK's supply of weapons to Kyiv and the sanctions regime that had been imposed. But he warned that 'economic aftershocks' of global crises meant huge disruptions to the global economy. 'No country is immune and no government can realistically shield everyone from the impact,' he said. Responding to the speech in the House of Commons, Starmer said the government had failed to respond to the scale of the looming 'stagflation crisis', while Conservative backbenchers David Davis and John Redwood called for tax cuts. Theresa May's former chief of staff Gavin Barwell tweeted that there was 'lots to like' in the Queen's speech, including a ban on no-fault evictions once promised by May; but he criticised the 'lack of action' on the cost of living, adding, 'both morally and politically the government needs to do more.' Starmer said: 'We need a government of the moment, with the ideas that meet the aspirations of the people.' He claimed that instead, the government was 'bereft of ideas or purpose, without a guiding principle or a roadmap for delivery'. He added: 'Their time has passed.' Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said: 'This Queen's speech does nothing to help the millions of families and pensioners facing soaring bills and eye watering inflation. It shows a prime minister refusing to listen to the clear message sent by voters at last week's local elections who are fed up of being taken for granted by this Conservative government.' Away from the cost of living, the government said it would introduce measures to ban no-fault evictions and tackle rogue landlords; and give councils new powers to sell off empty high street properties, in a levelling up and regeneration bill. There were also a series of measures that appeared aimed at allowing the government to pursue 'culture war' issues - including a promise that local people will be consulted before street names are changed; and a ban on councils pursuing political boycotts. Dominic Raab's plan to replace the Human Rights Act with a British bill of rights, aimed at curtailing the power of the European court of human rights in Strasbourg, was confirmed as a government priority. The speech said the legislation would 'ensure there is a proper balance between the rights of individuals, our vital national security and effective government, strengthening freedom of speech'. The president of the Law Society, Stephanie Boyce, attacked the planned legislation, however, warning it would undermine human rights. 'If the new bill of rights becomes law, it would make it harder for all of us to protect or enforce our rights. 'The proposed changes make the state less accountable. This undermines a crucial element of the rule of law, preventing people from challenging illegitimate uses of power.' The Queens speech also confirmed the fact that proposals for a radical overhaul of the planning system have been ditched, in favour of more modest changes ministers insist will give local people more, not less, say over developments in their neighbourhoods. Previous plans envisaged a zoning system that would introduce a presumption in favour of development in some areas. These were ditched, along with the then communities secretary Robert Jenrick, after the Tories' shock defeat in the Chesham and Amersham byelection was put partly down to fears the government was about to concrete over the green belt. The Treasury was later forced to dampen hopes of an emergency budget to help hard-pressed households, after Johnson suggested in the debate that he and the chancellor would have more to say on the cost of living crisis, 'in the days to come'. Rishi Sunak has repeatedly made clear he is unwilling to act until energy regulator Ofgem has made clear how much it will increase the price cap - an announcement likely to come in August. 'We're not there yet as we don't know where prices are going to land,' said a Treasury source. A No 10 source confirmed there were unlikely to be new spending measures to alleviate the cost of living crisis - but said all cabinet ministers had been tasked with coming up with policies in their areas to help. The government's cost of living committee was due to meet on Tuesday evening, ahead of a cabinet awayday in Staffordshire on Thursday. Proposals mooted at previous meetings included deregulating childcare and making MOTs two-yearly.", "0295dc62bb115ce9eda918359f3d55b7ca32415f2abf97870866921f": "A Labor MP in Australia's most marginal electorate has condemned a 'disgusting smear campaign' from an anti-abortion group backing the Coalition which claims the opposition wants to enact an 'extreme abortion agenda'. Macquarie MP Susan Templeman says the ALP has 'no proposals' to change the law around access to terminations as she faces a concerted campaign from pro-life group Cherish Life for the second election in a row. But the Queensland-based organisation - which is urging its supporters to vote for conservatives George Christensen, Amanda Stoker and Matt Canavan - has refused to back down, stating 'it is not a smear campaign, it is simply the truth'. 'Access to terminations is regulated at a state level and arrangements are well settled,' Templeman told Guardian Australia. 'There are no proposals to change things on either side of politics.' Cherish Life - formerly known as Right to Life Queensland - said it was campaigning to 'keep pro-abortion and pro-euthanasia MPs and parties out of government'. Despite being based in Queensland, the group has distributed political flyers in the New South Wales seat of Macquarie, claiming Labor planned to 'pay for more abortions, even late-term abortions of healthy babies of healthy mothers' and that Templeman was 'in full support of her party's extreme abortion agenda'. In 2019, Cherish Life distributed flyers in several key marginal electorates, including Macquarie, claiming 'more babies would die under a Bill Shorten Labor government' and accusing Labor of an 'extreme late-term abortion agenda'. The 2022 flyers cite as evidence a passage in Labor's 2021 national platform on 'sexual and reproductive health' which notes the party wants to 'expand service provision in the public system'. However, this section refers broadly to reproductive health and contraception, not only abortion. The passage notes Labor 'supports the rights of individuals to make decisions regarding their reproductive health' including 'to continue with their pregnancy'. The party's platform states Labor 'commits to expanding access to sexual and reproductive health care including contraception and termination as well as pregnancy and postnatal care' along with 'other support services'. Cherish Life, which has 10,000 followers on Facebook, is advocating that supporters 'put Labor last'. Macquarie, around the Blue Mountains area west of Sydney, is the most marginal seat in Australia, held by Labor on a margin of just 0.2%. Templeman won in 2019 by just 371 votes, despite the anti-abortion campaign targeting areas of the electorate with relatively high religious populations. 'This is nothing but a disgusting and factually incorrect smear campaign,' she said on Tuesday. Labor sources said they were not aware of the flyers being distributed in any other electorates outside Macquarie. But Cherish Life's executive director, Teeshan Johnson, said the group stood by its claims. She hit back at Labor's criticism and said her organisation planned to target other electorates with similar material. 'It is not a smear campaign, it is simply the truth,' Johnson said. 'The Cherish Life campaign is completely factual. What is 'disgusting' is Labor's national 'free abortions up to birth for any reason' mission, aided and abetted by the many Emily's Listers, like Susan Templeman in the Labor ranks. People like Ms Templeman with extreme pro-abortion views are unfit to govern.' Johnson said Cherish Life was working in 'a number of electorates' beside Macquarie. Stoker, the assistant attorney general and assistant minister for women, addressed Cherish Life's event March for Life in Brisbane on 29 April, saying she wanted to 'build a culture of life'. 'It baffles me that some people have questioned whether I am an appropriate person to serve as assistant minister for women because I am pro-life. They suggest there is some conflict between the roles,' Stoker said at the time. 'But there is no conflict in wanting to support women and the most vulnerable in our community.' Asked about Stoker's attendance at the rally, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said in early May, 'It's a free country.' Guardian Australia contacted Stoker's office for comment. Cherish Life states on its website it has 'no political alignment or affiliation'. Johnson has posted photos on Facebook of herself dressed in a shirt bearing the branding of Coalition MP Bert van Manen and handing out LNP how-to-vote cards in 2019. On its website, Cherish Life recommends supporters vote in the Senate for One Nation candidate and former LNP member Christensen, and Coalition senators Canavan and Stoker. In the lower house, Cherish Life praises Katter's Australian party as 'the highest-ranking party for life, followed by One Nation', but singled out LNP members Luke Howarth and Terry Young as being 'strong and consistent pro-life [politicians]'. Canavan, who also attended the March for Life, told Guardian Australia: 'I think we need more funding [for] hospitals so [we] can reduce waiting times for crucial surgeries not abortions.'", "403b1d4e6f49cb3e074a82815170137ca9726e7e920ee88ec3ef33f9": "A court in El Salvador has sentenced a woman who suffered a miscarriage to 30 years in prison for aggravated homicide, in a case which activists said offers a stark warning to women in the United States, where the supreme court is considering overturning a key ruling which legalized abortion. The woman, identified only as 'Esme', was sentenced on Monday, after nearly two years under pre-trial detention, following her arrest when she sought medical care in a public hospital. 'Esme's sentencing is a devastating step backward for the progress that has been made in the unlawful criminalization of women suffering obstetric emergencies in El Salvador,' said Paula Avila-Guillen, international human rights lawyer and executive director of the Women's Equality Center. Avila-Guillen warned that as the United States faces the possible overturning of Roe v Wade - the 1973 supreme court ruling that effectively legalised abortion - similar cases will become more common across the world. 'We have seen repeatedly throughout Latin America that when abortion is criminalized, women are made to prove that any one of the wide range of obstetric emergencies they experience were in fact emergencies. When they can't or don't have the resources to do so or are simply not believed, they face imprisonment,' she said. 'Everyone in the US should have their eyes on El Salvador right now to understand exactly what a future without Roe entails.' Morena Herrera, the president of The Citizens' Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion described the sentence as 'a heavy blow', and called for miscarriages to be treated as a public health issue rather than a criminal one. 'We will continue to fight so that all women unjustly criminalized by these circumstances regain their freedom and have the opportunity to remake and rebuild their lives,' she said. El Salvador has some of the world's most draconian abortion laws, with a total ban on the procedure. Unlike in many other Latin American countries, El Salvador does not permit abortion in cases where the child is conceived by rape or incest, or where the health of the mother or child is at risk. Over the past two decades, more than 180 women have been jailed for murder for having an abortion after suffering obstetric emergencies, according to rights groups. Since December, eight women serving long prison sentences have had those sentences commuted.", "8c55026bb194cc6d504cc7ef8eb60b25ba0d33211b49e6f4123a2b11": "New Zealand will fully reopen to the world two months earlier than originally planned, prime minister Jacinda Ardern has announced as part of a wider shake-up to immigration settings. The country swiftly closed the border in March 2020 to prevent the arrival of Covid-19. It has just started reopening to some non-New Zealand citizens and residents over the past few months - beginning with Australians and followed by travellers from 60 visa-waiver countries. From 11.59pm on 31 July, tourists and visa-holders from the rest of the world will also be allowed back for the first time in over two years. The original date had been set for October, but the government long maintained the opening could be brought forward if it was deemed safe to do so. 'This will be welcome news for families, businesses and our migrant communities,' Ardern said on Wednesday. 'It also provides certainty and good preparation time for airlines and cruise ship companies planning a return to New Zealand in the peak spring and summer seasons.' The border announcement is part of a suite of reforms to immigration settings, including streamlining immigration pathways to attract skilled workers back to the country, extending visas for migrants already in the country, allowing cruise ships and international students to return and new settings that will help New Zealand move away from its reliance on low-wage, low-skill migrant labour. The prime minister, who is isolating at home after her partner tested positive for Covid-19, announced the reforms via video link as part of her pre-budget speech. She also reflected on her recent travels, the war in Ukraine, inflation and promoted the government's vision for a stable economic future. The budget will be announced on 19 May and will help set the political scene as the country heads towards a 2023 election. 'We have come through the Covid shock better than almost anywhere in the developed world. Our economy is one of the strongest in the world,' Ardern said. Now it was time to reconnect with the globe, she said. 'New Zealand is in demand and now fully open for business.' The announcement comes a month after warnings the country is at risk of losing high-skilled workers, with government documents estimating 50,000 New Zealanders are poised to leave over the next year. Ardern said reopening New Zealand's borders will help relieve 'urgent skills shortages'. A key part of the immigration reforms is the 'Green List' of hard-to-fill jobs in sectors including construction, engineering, health and technology. The government will aim to attract workers to fill those roles with incentives and a new streamlined application process, the immigration minister, Kris Faafoi, said. 'New Zealand cannot return to pre-pandemic trends that saw us overly reliant on growing numbers of lower-skilled workers and resulted in the increased exploitation of migrants,' Faafoi said. New Zealand has been shown to have the heaviest reliance on temporary migrant workers in the OECD, Ardern added. 'I want to be clear, migrants shape our society for the better in so many ways,' she said. 'But we have a duty of care to everyone, that as we reopen our borders, we do so with a plan in place that means we learn the lessons of the past.' The government said it will also increase local skills through trades training and apprenticeships.", "c88e44487a36de5dfc58cf83ce451b0a072fb352f814cd0d08a97f82": "An Adidas campaign featuring dozens of sets of breasts to promote the diversity of its range of sports bras has been banned by the UK advertising watchdog for using explicit nudity and appearing where children could see the ads. The campaign, versions of which ran on Twitter and select large poster sites, prompted 24 complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) that the ads were gratuitous, objectified women by 'sexualising them and reducing them to body parts', were harmful and offensive and were able to be seen by children. Adidas UK defended the images, saying they were not gratuitous or sexual but were intended to 'reflect and celebrate different shapes and sizes and illustrate diversity'. The sportswear company said the images had been cropped to protect the identity of the models, and that they had all volunteered and were supportive of the campaign's aims. Adidas added that it had not run the ads on posters or billboards near schools or religious venues, and did not think the campaign would cause harm or distress to children. The ASA said the depiction of naked breasts, including in one ad where pixellation was used to blur the nipples of the models, was 'likely to be seen as explicit nudity'. 'We noted the breasts were the main focus in the ads, and there was less emphasis on the bras themselves, which were only referred to in the accompanying text,' the ASA said. 'As the ads contained explicit nudity, we considered that they required careful targeting to avoid causing offence to those who viewed them.' The ASA said the large poster sites were not targeted and could be seen by people of all ages, including children, and the ads were therefore likely to cause widespread offence. The use of the ad on the Adidas Twitter feed was not in keeping with the usual content posted, the ASA said, and also likely to offend. 'The ads must not appear again in the forms complained of,' ruled the ASA. 'We told Adidas UK to ensure their ads did not cause offence and were targeted responsibly.'  The headline of this article was amended on 12 May 2022 to more accurately reflect the detail of the ASA ruling ", "1b4b76ce902d239adc7c46b2bce895f1639faad5420ff6ba8d330061": "Apple has discontinued the iPod more than 20 years after it was launched. The most recent iteration of the music player, the iPod Touch, has not been updated since 2019, and many of its features are now available on other products. Apple said it would continue to sell the Touch, the only generation of the iPod still on sale, 'while supplies last'. The iPod was released in 2001, and was the first MP3 player capable of storing 1,000 songs. Aside from the Touch, versions included the iPod mini, iPod Nano, and iPod Shuffle. By 2011, Apple held a 70% global market share in MP3 players, and to date more than 400m iPods have been sold. The company stopped selling the Nano and Shuffle, its last standalone music players, in 2017, and industry experts had long predicted the Touch would follow given the prevalence of the iPhone and other smartphones that can be used to listen to music. Later versions of the Touch increasingly resembled smartphones, allowing users to take photos, send emails and make video calls. In a statement announcing the discontinuation, Greg Joswiak, Apple's senior vice-president of worldwide marketing, said the 'spirit of iPod lives on'. 'Music has always been part of our core at Apple, and bringing it to hundreds of millions of users in the way iPod did impacted more than just the music industry - it also redefined how music is discovered, listened to and shared,' he said.", "f7306ea820de0d66cfd0b7165cb6079a724e81e88fd1ab769a92763f": "", "d105c80a52fbf586598f436e85de4e887e245a7eed3d06a74934bcc5": "As millions of Indonesians travelled to their hometowns to celebrate Eid al-Fitr, one common struggle was being discussed in most family gatherings: the price of cooking oil. 'I always host Eid al-Fitr celebrations for my big family. I cook everything for around 20 of us. But this year is the first time I had to ask them to chip in because everything is so expensive, especially the oil, and I really can't handle it on my own,' Ellifa Kartini said. Palm oil is the most widely used cooking oil in Indonesia. Like many people, Kartini uses it for her family and for her business. She has run a small catering firm from her home in Bekasi, West Java, for 25 years. She also produces and sells traditional cookies. But the rising cost of cooking oil has been extremely difficult for her business. 'Eid al-Fitr is that time of the year when I get the most orders and the biggest revenue. I could produce more than 25kg of fried cookies just for Eid al-Fitr. But this year I decided not to take any orders because the price is just too expensive. And if I raise my cookie price, I know my customers will not want to buy it,' she said. Ellifa said she needs around six litres of cooking oil each week for her business. On normal days it costs around Rp 15,000 ($US1.04) per litre, but for the past few months the price has kept rising , up to Rp 30,000 per litre. 'Before it went up that much, it first disappeared from stores and markets. I have to queue up for hours just to get one litre. Sometimes I even have to go to another district to find it. But when it reached Rp 30,000 per litre I just gave up. The price just doesn't make sense anymore,' she said. Mohammad Faisal, Indonesia executive director at the Centre of Reform on Economics (CORE) said there are two main reasons for the jump in prices: the impact of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Indonesia is the world's largest producer of palm oil. Faisal said last year the country saw a spike in Covid cases and this affected the supply of palm oil. Producers were unable to meet levels of demand as Covid impacted workforces and disrupted output. Separately, supplies of another popular cooking oil - sunflower - have been strained after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Both Russia and Ukraine are among the world's main exporters of sunflower oil. In an attempt to boost supplies in Indonesia, president Joko Widodo said from 28 April the government would ban the export of cooking oil and its raw materials . He said the policy was designed to ensure 'abundant and affordable domestic cooking oil supplies'. Kartini has not noticed any change since the export ban and while she has seen many fluctuations in palm oil prices in the past, this is the worst one so far. 'The price skyrocketed too high. But usually changes like this only last around a month, but this is the longest one. How many more months should we suffer?' she asked. According to Statistics Indonesia, the price of palm oil has been rising since October 2021 - and prices have not fallen since the export ban was imposed.  In regions outside Java island, palm oil has become even more scarce. Yulian Juita, 32, who lives in Manggarai, East Nusa Tenggara said cooking oil has been disappearing for months. When it appeared, the price had doubled. 'But I will buy it anyway, because we need it. I'm lucky because I only cook for my toddler and husband. But I try my best to be more frugal when using it,' she said. Juita said she usually uses around three litres a month, but now she tries to only use half that amount. In March, former president Megawati Soekarnoputri caused uproar when she criticised mothers for making so much fried food and said they should boil or steam instead.  'Cooking oil is a very important part of our life, and you cannot underestimate this issue by forcing families to just boil everything instead of frying it. I've tried it, but it is not that simple. I have a three-year-old kid and his favourite food is fried fish. It's challenging to only feed him boiled or steamed food,' Juita said. Some experts have criticised the government's move to ban exports of cooking oil, saying it won't help lower prices. 'In theory, the ban on the export of cooking palm oil and imported raw materials will make domestic supply abundant,' said Rusli Abdullah, researcher at the Institute for Development of Economics and Finance (Indef). 'However, this does not guarantee that entrepreneurs will release their oil or raw materials when the prices are not attractive,' he said. CORE's Faisal described the move as 'hasty' and says the export ban may have wide-reaching repercussions. 'The ban ... has the potential to cause huge losses to industry players, many of whom could be not related to the cooking oil [ban],' he said. Kartini says she hopes cooking oil prices will come down soon, as her business is the main source of income for her family.  'I hope it will end soon, I'm really afraid that it could affect my ability to pay for my children's education if it keeps going. It's really killing us,' she said.", "7f5694e53c1331510f399f2509d084c535838fdfba7606dab98e4771": "", "946fb7475fa2ff0581d39d52707dd91a5d005819522d94e434e5b1cf": "", "33abaaff0b98af1275a13527cf8788e28318e454b010e93d5bfe3dca": "", "ef40224ca08ff904c132c273162c9c86481f4626e95675cb8d4bc920": "", "b5faecc29258eb5d73201462ec6055aa38dc4aa5c15ed5b3c4d408d3": "", "da8ff0cc85540105efea062165e8390baf63c4d2cc03bbaec3460ea4": "", "7d64f599882128ead3fb784fbec47176205b614f1876c0817df7ccc4": "", "2881a25d1f273ec93419beac6e79bbdabafabe980d181b6378a88116": "", "10d37c974b238bc4cc359a6f07d438f946538f589d867c1e5152a55e": "", "8b79232cf53ae7d520d2d194f7eb395a5c6edc624837b928cf51e2cb": "", "de0328a570b6d231e722891ec2e0fd1b7d5bf341ba703ed4d38f823b": "", "40597674a945e7b039476909fb2bea5337fcf443b2112433b905b5e7": "", "31f5c023af1f109dc48e2d8b1f7482c2d438a7164e85259f06fadfbc": "", "9eaa49c829971eb6bf2e48f65541c7dbff237999d57d3d4931217463": "", "0e1646aaddcb4605326798a3609d1381fd02dd264acdf13d3d691ba8": "", "f7820fb9df66b181e47d0effe8d21ae8fa0d4dc498150c9b085624f3": "", "ca4c5ff5d1459a970ce5306a8f10057195b99806e8fdebde1b1dffa4": "", "9aedfd398e15655f4f98f021df8a572e75df5a89c6a3dd85ef2b327e": "", "04f4245443334eda7353d0993f25819126b54533b47d1603567a5826": "", "e4a8cc2e83bda05543fa6f369d93bf6609db82d809ef92ff84bec748": "The year the world breaches for the first time the 1.5C global heating limit set by international governments is fast approaching, a new forecast shows. The probability of one of the next five years surpassing the limit is now 50%, scientists led by the UK Met Office found. As recently as 2015, there was zero chance of this happening in the following five years. But this surged to 20% in 2020 and 40% in 2021. The global average temperature was 1.1C above pre-industrial levels in 2021. It is also close to certain - 93% - that by 2026 one year will be the hottest ever recorded, beating 2016, when a natural El Nino climate event supercharged temperatures. It is also near certain that the average temperature of the next five years will be higher than the past five years, as the climate crisis intensifies. 'The 1.5C figure is not some random statistic. It is rather an indicator of the point at which climate impacts will become increasingly harmful for people and indeed the entire planet,' said Prof Petteri Taalas, head of the World Meteorological Organization, which published the new report. 'For as long as we continue to emit greenhouse gases, temperatures will continue to rise,' said Taalas. 'Alongside that, our oceans will continue to become warmer and more acidic, sea ice and glaciers will continue to melt, sea level will continue to rise and our weather will become more extreme.' Natural climate cycles can nudge global temperatures up or down. But the Paris Agreement requires nations to hold the underlying rise, driven by human activities, to well below 2C, as well as pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5C. The world's scientists warned in 2018 that 1.5C of global heating will bring severe impacts to billions of people. 'A single year of exceedance above 1.5C does not mean we have breached the iconic threshold of the Paris Agreement, but it does reveal that we are edging ever closer to a situation where 1.5C could be exceeded for an extended period,' said Dr Leon Hermanson, at the Met Office. 'The possibility of surpassing the 1.5C threshold, even if only for a year, is worrying,' said Dr Andrew King, at the University of Melbourne. 'Our greenhouse gas emissions are still at near-record highs and until we get emissions down to net zero we're going to continue to see global warming. Rapid and drastic emissions reductions are needed urgently.' 'To actually exceed the [Paris] target we'd have to be above 1.5C even in a 'normal' year' unaffected by natural climate variations, said Prof Steven Sherwood at the University of New South Wales. 'But the report reminds us that we are getting uncomfortably close to this target.' The annual forecast harnesses the best prediction systems from climate centres around the world to produce practical information for decision-makers. It found a higher chance of rain in 2022 compared with the average of the past 30 years in northern Europe, the Sahel, north-east Brazil and Australia, while drier conditions than usual are forecast for south-western Europe and south-western North America. Prof Taalas also warned of especially rapid heating at the north pole: 'Arctic warming is disproportionately high and what happens in the Arctic affects all of us.' The shrinking of sea ice and its knock-on effects have been linked to extreme weather events in Europe, the North America and Asia, including heatwaves, floods and even snowstorms. The forecast indicates that the rise in Arctic temperatures will be three times greater than the global average over the next five years.", "acec35561fd4d4fb39a19459c0feb901bee933745006f03ec9ba670a": "As president, Donald Trump repeatedly asked aides if China could be manufacturing hurricanes and sending them to damage the United States, three unnamed former senior officials told Rolling Stone on Tuesday. Trump also reportedly wanted to know if using such a 'hurricane gun' would constitute an act of war, and if so, whether the US could retaliate militarily. China is a major nuclear power. 'It was almost too stupid for words,' one source told the magazine, which said the speaker was 'intimately familiar with the then sitting president's inquiry'. 'I did not get the sense he was joking at all,' the source added. The news comes on the tail of former defense secretary Mark Esper's claim, in a new book, that Trump wanted to hit 'drug labs' in Mexico with missiles and then deny responsibility, and other hair-raising accounts of near foreign policy disaster. Rolling Stone quoted a second former official as saying: 'I was present [once] when he asked if China 'made' hurricanes to send to us. [Trump] wanted to know if the technology existed. One guy in the room responded, 'Not to the best of my knowledge, sir.' 'I kept it together until I got back to my office ... I do not know where the [then-]president would have heard about that ... He was asking about it around the time, maybe a little before, he asked people about nuking hurricanes.' In August 2019, the website Axios reported that in a briefing on hurricanes, Trump told top officials: 'I got it. I got it. Why don't we nuke them?' Trump was reportedly told that aides would 'look into' the notion of destroying large storms with nuclear weapons, which in 2016 National Geographic called 'a really bad idea' with 'a surprising history'. Trump called the Axios story 'ridiculous'. But his interest in hurricanes reared its head again the following week, in what would come to be known as 'Sharpiegate'. At an Oval Office briefing on Hurricane Dorian, Trump held up a National Hurricane Center map that appeared to have been altered with a Sharpie pen, to show the storm hitting Alabama - a baseless claim previously made by Trump. Trump did not comment to Rolling Stone about its 'hurricane gun' story. Stephanie Grisham, his press secretary at the time of Sharpiegate and his reported remark about 'nuking' hurricanes, told the magazine she did not hear conversation about China making hurricanes, but it would not have surprised her if she had. 'Stuff like that was not unusual for him,' Grisham said. 'He would blurt out crazy things all the time, and tell aides to look into it or do something about it.' 'His staff would say they'd look into, knowing that more often than not, he'd forget about it quickly - much like a toddler.'", "6ec0c6f9d62d1cd0258decc526d0dbc2bdc2ff42a945b83760325737": "How migrating animals like sea turtles navigate hundreds to thousands of kilometres across the open ocean has intrigued biologists since Charles Darwin. But some sea turtles might not really know where they're going, new research suggests. Analysis by an international team of scientists has mapped the movements of hawksbill turtles as they swam from their nesting grounds in the Chagos Archipelago to foraging sites also in the Indian Ocean. It found the turtles often travelled in circuitous routes when migrating short distances, suggesting the animals' navigational sense is relatively crude while in the open ocean. The turtles typically travelled twice the required distance to their target locations. One individual swam 1,306km to reach an island that was a mere 176km away - travelling more than seven times the beeline distance. The team tagged and tracked via satellite 22 hawksbill turtles after they had finished nesting. Generally, sea turtles do not forage and nest in the same geographical area. These animals would have already undergone a migration from their foraging grounds, a mating season, and have laid multiple clutches of eggs before preparing for the return trip. Chair in marine science at Deakin University and the study's first author, Prof Graeme Hays, said if the turtles were perfect navigators, they would probably travel in direct paths from their nesting sites to foraging areas in search for food. 'Those turtles that we're tracking - they most probably hadn't eaten for four or five months,' he said. Previous research has suggested that turtles likely imprint on the magnetic field of their birth area - where they later return to lay eggs - and detect changes in the Earth's magnetic field as a means of navigating through the ocean. Hays said the new study suggested the turtles 'almost certainly are using a geomagnetic map, but it's a fairly coarse resolution'.  'So it doesn't allow pinpoint straight-line migration, but it does tell them when they're getting a long way off route,' he said. Hawksbill turtles typically migrate distances of about 150km, a modest distance compared with the migration of green turtles, Hays said. 'For green turtles that nest in the Chagos Archipelago ... we've tracked them going almost 5,000km to their foraging grounds,' he said. 'They'll swim all the way across the Indian Ocean to the mainland African coast. 'Although it's a long journey, in a sense it's actually quite an easy navigational task because all the turtle has to do is swim vaguely westwards and it'll eventually hit Africa.' Though hawksbill turtles were making far shorter migrations in comparison, they had the tricky navigational task of locating small, specific places like remote isolated islands or submerged banks. The new research suggests the turtles' geomagnetic map sense is not fine-grained enough to locate specific targets. When closer to their intended locations, the animals likely use other navigational cues including sense of smell and visual landmarks, Hays said. 'In the final stages, they can smell an island that they're headed to.' 'As they get some sort of visual landmark, for example, the water starts to get a bit shallower and they can see the seabed, then they probably got some sort of cognitive map of that area. They could probably just recognise the seafloor, just like you would recognise visual landmarks in the area where you live.' The research, published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.

Today the markets will be focused on US inflation, out at lunchtime. Just out now: Inflation in Germany, Europe's biggest economy, hit a new record high in April, pushed higher by food and energy prices. The annual rate rose to 7.4% from 7.3% in March. The German statistics office said the main factor in March was higher energy prices, but this time round it flagged above-average increases in food prices. 'This is where the impact of the war in Ukraine is becoming more and more visible.' Food prices rose 8.6% across all areas: prices for fats and oils jumped 27.3% amid panic-buying of vegetable oil at German supermarkets, while meat and meat products rose 11.8%, dairy products and eggs went up 9.4% in price and fresh vegetables became 9.3% dearer. Energy products prices soared again, by 35.3%, compared with March's 39.5% increase. Georg Thiel, president of the Federal Statistics Office, said: Here in Britain, the picture is similarly bleak. A respected UK think tank warns today that more than 250,000 households will 'slide into destitution' next year, taking the total number in extreme poverty to around 1.2m, unless the government acts to help the poorest families hit by the energy price shock,  The National Institute for Economic & Social Research said more than 1.5m households will see the rise in food and energy bills outstrip their disposable income, forcing them to rely on savings or extra borrowing to make up the shortfall, said the thinktank, which blamed welfare spending cuts since the Brexit vote in 2016 for leaving millions of families in a vulnerable financial position. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said the German inflation number will reinforce In China, factory gate inflation eased to the slowest rate in a year in April, with the annual rate in producer prices falling to 8% from 8.3% in March. The consumer prices index rose at its fastest pace this year, 2.1%, up from 1.5%, but is still below the levels it was at late last year. US stocks managed to eke out some small gains yesterday after the big declines earlier this week. But trading was choppy, and it could have gone either way, said ING analyst Iris Pang. Asian shares rose after trading close to two-year lows the previous day, and the dollar held steady ahead of the US inflation data. China's blue-chip index CSI 300 rose 2.3% after producer prices rose at the slowest pace in a year, leaving room for more fiscal stimulus to shore up the Covid-battered economy. The Hong Kong market rose 1.4% while Australia was little changed. European shares are also expected to open higher.  The Agenda Before I go, our economics writer Phillip Inman has sent this: It was gratifying to hear Treasury select committee chair Mel Stride quote in today's session the Observer interview with Peterson Institute president Adam Posen, where he said the Bank of England's monetary policy committee 'had no choice' but to increase interest rates aggressively and if that meant triggering a recession, so be it. Posen thinks Brexit has permanently damaged the UK economy and the negative impact means it needs to help shrink demand with higher borrowing costs to better match a supply side, not so much hit by the pandemic, as the loss of trade with the EU and access to EU workers. US inflation dipped slightly to 8.3% in April, but stayed close to March's 40-year high of 8.5%, and food prices rose at the fastest pace since April 1981.  The headline annual inflation rate was higher than expected, as was the core inflation rate, which excludes energy and food, and dipped to 6.3%, from 6.5% in March. Analysts said this could be the beginning of a sustained decline in inflation, but this won't stop the Federal Reserve announcing more half-point rate hikes in coming months. German inflation hit a new record high of 7.4% last month as food and energy prices jumped, while inflation in China also picked up, to 2.1% from 1.5%. On the markets, oil and gas prices have risen, as Russian gas flows via Ukraine have been disrupted for the first time since the war started with Moscow's invasion of the country in late February. This comes on top of fears over tighter energy supply, as the European Union works on getting support from Hungary for an embargo on Russian oil. The EU decision needs support from all member states. The global oil benchmarks, Brent crude and US light crude, have risen 4.3% to $106.92 a barrel, and 5% to $104.81 a barrel, respectively. Russian gas flows to Europe via Ukraine are down by a quarter today after Kyiv halted use of a major transit route blaming interference by occupying Russian forces, and prepared to divert supplies to a different route. The European Central Bank's president, Christine Lagarde, has cemented expectations for an interest rate hike in July, with comments made at a conference in Slovenia today. It would be the first time the central bank raises borrowing costs in more than a decade. Our other main stories today: Thank you for reading. We'll be back tomorrow. Take care! - JK On Wall Street, the Nasdaq and Dow Jones have opened lower, while European shares are still trading higher. Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at Capital Economics, said the falls in headline and core inflation in April 'should mark the beginning of a sustained decline, as base effects improve and supply shortages ease, although the 0.6% monthly jump in core prices indicates that underlying inflation pressures are stronger than we had expected'. He explained: Wall Street futures have turned negative, indicating a lower open when US indices start trading in just over half an hour.  The Nasdaq is seen falling 1.1% at the open, while the Dow Jones is expected to dip 0.4% and the S&P 500 is set to fall 0.6%. US 10-year government bond yields jumped, after what some described as a 'grim' inflation report. Richard Carter, head of fixed interest research at the investment management firm Quilter Cheviot, said:  The core inflation rate in America, which strips out food and energy because they tend to be volatile, dipped to 6.3% from 6.5%. This was also higher than the 6% rate pencilled in by Wall Street analysts. Energy prices rose 30.3% over the last year, while food prices increased by 9.4%, the largest 12-month increase since April 1981, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. You can read the full release here. US inflation has come in higher than expected in April, and stayed close to a 40-year high. The annual rate dipped slightly to 8.3% from 8.5% in March, while economists had forecast a bigger easing to 8.1%. The European Central Bank's president, Christine Lagarde, has cemented expectations for an interest rate hike this summer, Reuters reported. The ECB is likely to end its bond-buying stimulus programme early in the third quarter of this year, followed by a rate hike that could come just 'a few weeks' later, Lagarde said today. A rate hike will be the first time the central bank raises borrowing costs in over a decade in July in an attempt to put a lid on record-high inflation in the eurozone, driven as surging energy prices spill over to other goods. Most other major central banks have already raised borrowing costs but the ECB, which had fought too-low inflation for a decade, is still pumping cash into the financial system via bond purchases. Lagarde said at a conference in the Slovenian capital: A growing number of ECB policymakers are calling for a July hike after inflation hit 7.5% in the eurozone last month and even the core inflation rate, which strips out food and energy prices, rose above the ECB's 2% target. ECB policymaker Bostjan Vasle, governor of the Slovenian central bank, said at the same event: ECB board member Frank Elderson also said earlier today that the ECB may consider a rate hike in July, a move that has also been advocated by Bundesbank president Joachim Nagel, among others. Lloyd's of London, the world's oldest and biggest insurance market, has asked insurance firms to dial into next week's annual meeting online rather than in person, because it fears the meeting will be overshadowed by further climate protests outside its headquarters (the striking Richard Rogers-designed building) at One Lime Street in the City of London. Bruce Carnegie-Brown, the chairman, said in a memo to the nearly 100 syndicates that make up the market that 'the risk of disruption has significantly increased' since Lloyd's sent out invitations to the meeting on 19 May. The warning comes nearly a month after Lloyd's was forced to shut the doors of its building, when more than 60 protesters from Extinction Rebellion used superglue, chains and bicycle locks to prevent workers from entering. They unfurled a banner that read: 'End fossil fuels now'. The Lloyd's corporation is not doing enough to stop insurers' investments in - and insurance cover of - fossil fuel projects, protesters argue. Oil prices are rising today after falling nearly 10% in the previous two sessions, on supply concerns as the European Union tries to garner support for an embargo on Russian oil. Both global benchmarks, Brent crude and US light crude, are up around 3% on the day, at $105.49 and $102.81 a barrel respectively. The EU decision needs unanimous support from all member states, but the vote has been delayed because Hungary has dug in its heels, opposing an oil embargo. Oil prices - and gas prices - have also been boosted by disruptions to Russian gas flows to Europe via Ukraine. They are down by a quarter today after Kyiv halted use of a major transit route blaming interference by occupying Russian forces. It's the first time Russian exports via Ukraine have been disrupted since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. Kremlin-controlled Gazprom, which has a monopoly on Russian gas exports by pipeline, said it was still shipping gas to Europe via Ukraine, but volumes fell to 72m cubic metres from 95.8m mcm on Tuesday. The gasp pipeline via the Sokhranivka transit point runs through Ukraine's Luhansk region, which is partly under control of pro-Russian separatists. GTSOU, which runs Ukraine's gas system, said on Tuesday it would suspend gas flows through that transit point and invoked 'force majeure'. It said it would divert deliveries to Europe to another route, the Sudzha entry point. The Dutch wholesale gas benchmark for day-ahead delivery rose 6.5%. Ukraine's economy is expected to shrink by 45% this year, according to its finance minister, Serhiy Marchenko. He added that his government is committed to servicing the country's debts in full. He said during a briefing at the annual meeting of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in Marrakech, Morocco: ITV has warned it expects an advertising slump over the coming months because of economic uncertainty and the absence of a major commercial event like last year's European football championship, writes our media business correspondent Mark Sweney. The broadcaster hailed a 'robust' start to the year, having grown TV and digital advertising revenues by a healthy 16% year-on-year to PS468m in the first three months. ITV grew total external revenues - including income from its in-house ITV Studios operation, which makes shows including Snowpiercer, Hell's Kitchen and Love Island - by 18% to PS834m for the first quarter. However, the company said it narrowly missed its forecast of 10% total advertising growth for April, hitting 9% instead. May is expected to be down 8% year-on-year, with June off 15%, with the second quarter overall dropping 6% year-on-year. Michael Gove has been accused of minimising the cost of living crisis after he ruled out an emergency budget and admitted the government would fail to meet its target of building 300,000 homes a year, writes our deputy political editor Rowena Mason. The UK levelling up secretary said it would be 'patronising' for him to intervene to advise people who were struggling to make ends meet and blamed the current squeeze on global inflation. The Queen's speech on Tuesday contained no significant measures to help people with the soaring cost of living, but Boris Johnson had promised there would be news of extra assistance in the coming days. However, Gove told Sky News: 'There won't be an emergency budget. It is sometimes the case that the words from a prime minister or minister are over-interpreted. The prime minister is right. We will be saying more and doing more in order to help people with the cost of living challenge we face at the moment, but that doesn't amount to an emergency budget. It is part of the work of government. 'Last night, the prime minister convened a group of ministers - we have all done work on some of the things we could do to help. Those policy initiatives will be announced by individual departments in due course as they are worked up.'", "2fc39711eea72bf3314fe7e0fb9c47575985ef41058a64ce5eef774b": "A Canadian lawmaker has apologized after he was caught logging on to a closed parliamentary session from a toilet stall. Liberal party member Shafqat Ali participated in a hybrid session of parliament last Friday, joining with a Zoom-like feed visible only to other parliamentarians. But Conservative members grew suspicious of his surroundings. Conservative MP Laila Goodridge told the House of Commons that a lawmaker 'might be participating in a washroom' somewhere inside parliament - an allegation that baffled the Speaker of the House until it was confirmed by parliamentary pages. On Monday, the Conservative House leader, John Brassard, told parliament that after studying the stonework, door hinges and coat hook, lawmakers had concluded Ali had placed his camera 'on the ledge or ridge on the wall just above the back of the toilet'. 'The member of parliament was literally using the washroom while participating in a sitting of the House of Commons, the cathedral of Canadian democracy,' he said. 'I can't believe I actually just said those words, Madame Speaker.' Ali apologized, calling the incident from a toilet stall in the building's West Block an 'unfortunate event' that arose from a lapse in judgment. 'I take this matter extremely seriously, and I promise never to repeat this error again,' he said. The deputy House speaker, Chris D'Entremont, said Ali's apology was sufficient enough to close the matter - but warned MPs 'to always be vigilant' when participating remotely. 'If you don't have to have the camera on, turn it off,' D'Entremont said. 'If you don't have to be in voting, turn it off.' The bathroom stall incident is the second time the Liberals have been embarrassed by the conduct of a party member participating in parliament remotely. In 2021, Will Amos was spotted naked on camera while changing after a run. He apologized, but then later admitted to urinating in a mug while attending a committee session. He said he would 'seek assistance' and did not run in last year's federal election.", "335c179ab62635537fc699f920caf98f7d6f36a5a4c8fdfcff28d441": "Former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez has pleaded not guilty in a New York court to drug and weapons charges as his lawyer pledged to subpoena three former US presidents - and an imprisoned Mexican drug lord - to testify in his defence. Hernandez, who was extradited last month, wore shackles round his ankles at his arraignment in Manhattan on Tuesday, where he pleaded not guilty to three criminal counts, including conspiracy to import cocaine and weapons possession. US prosecutors have accused Hernandez, once seen as a close US ally, of receiving millions of dollars from drug traffickers in exchange for protection from arrest while leading Honduras from 2014 until January of this year. Hernandez used the money to enrich himself and finance his political campaigns, prosecutors said. Outside the court, his lawyer Raymond Colon said that he plans to subpoena Joe Biden, Barack Obama and Donald Trump to vouch for Hernandez, who was the first Honduran president to agree to the extradition of drug traffickers from the country. 'Why not? Biden may be busy running the country, but I can't think of anything that Trump is doing that's important and I know that Mr Obama is retired, so ...' Colon said. Colon also said he would subpoena the Mexican drug lord Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, who is serving a life sentence in the US on drug trafficking charges. Earlier, Colon told the judge that Hernandez has been held for three weeks in solitary confinement like a 'prisoner of war'. 'We're not asking for him to get special treatment because he's a former head of state, but these conditions are psychologically debilitating,' he said. 'He's not a terrorist,' Colon said. 'There's no violence in his history.' The former president has been named in a string of court cases in New York, with prosecutors telling one jury that Hernandez had allegedly plotted with a notorious trafficker to 'shove the drugs right up the gringos' noses'. Hernandez has denied the allegations, portraying himself as a fierce opponent of drug cartels and accusing traffickers of smearing him to get revenge and lighten their sentences. The Trump administration turned a blind eye to the accusations while Hernandez continued to bend to the will of its migration agenda. But the Biden administration, which has pledged to fight corruption as part of its plan to address the root causes of migration, shunned the outgoing president during his last months in office. A spokesperson for the US Bureau of Prisons confirmed Hernandez was being held at the Brooklyn detention facility but declined to comment on 'any individual inmate's conditions of confinement'. Judge Kevin Castel set a tentative trial date of 17 January.", "924ef53f48f34d44844ebe65b78fc729a56f0c296b92799ecd490d3a": "Survivors of the brutal regime of the late Philippines dictator Ferdinand Marcos have described his son's apparent landslide presidential election victory as the product of trickery and disinformation, warning it is unlikely the billions stolen by his family will be recovered, and that human rights in the country will be weakened. Ferdinand 'Bongbong' Marcos Jr had won more than 30.8m votes in a highly divisive presidential election by Monday, according to an unofficial count. His vote tally is more than double that of his closest challenger, the human rights lawyer and current vice-president, Leni Robredo, who had campaigned based on transparency and good governance. Marcos said he would bridge political divides in his country, urging people: 'Judge me not by my ancestors, but by my actions.' His message has not convinced survivors who were tortured, imprisoned, or whose relatives were killed, during his father's 20-year rule. Nor is it likely to win over critics who want the family to return the vast sums it took from state coffers. As much as $10bn was plundered. The Marcos family and its supporters have attempted to rebrand the rule of Marcos Sr as a golden era of peace and prosperity. Social media has been flooded with false claims relating to the family and its opponents, prompting media and academics to begin factchecking initiatives. Bonifacio Ilagan, convener of Campaign Against the Return of the Marcoses and Martial Law, said Marcos Jr's calls for unity were 'empty and self-serving for as long as he does not address the basic questions concerning his father's dictatorship, of which he was very much a part'. Ilagan was tortured and imprisoned as a student, and his sister was disappeared.'I for one - and I think I can represent a lot - will never accept a president who continues to be the chief administrator of an estate that embodies plunder,' Ilagan said. On Tuesday in Manila, crowds, many wearing black, gathered in front of Commission on Elections office to protesting against the return of the Marcoses, alleging cheating and questioning why results had appeared so quickly. Election officials have rejected claims of rigging and said results were processed more quickly than in previous years because equipment had been upgraded. The results were in line with the findings of opinion surveys conducted by pollsters in the run-up to the election. Activists say that, either way, Marcos did not conduct his campaign fairly. 'He flooded social media with historical distortions and refused to engage the media to answer the painful questions that we wanted him to address,' said Ilagan, who said the campaign was based on 'trickery and historical distortions'. Although Marcos Jr has denied the existence of any organised online campaign, he was the overwhelming beneficiary of false claims circulating on social media. The majority of disinformation was either designed to undermine Robredo's reputation or enhance the images of the Marcoses, according to analysis by the factchecking coalition Tsek.ph, which monitored disinformation in the run-up to the election. Cristina Palabay, the secretary general of Karapatan, a human rights NGO, said Marcos and his running mate, Sara Duterte, the daughter of the outgoing president, Rodrigo Duterte, 'represent the worst brand of traditional politics and governance in our nation's history'. 'Under Duterte, the human rights crisis has spiralled with extrajudicial killings, arrests and detention, forcible evacuation and other human rights violations, including violations on press freedom and freedom of association,' Palabay said. Marcos has said he will not allow prosecutors of the international criminal court to visit the Philippines to investigate Duterte's 'war on drugs', shielding him from prosecution. Survivors of the Marcos regime fear public understanding of the period, already distorted by online misinformation, will be further damaged.  'Although there are efforts now to try to put the correct version in the textbooks of the children, I don't think that's going to be continued,' said Doris Nuval, who was imprisoned for nearly five years under Marcos, the longest of any female political prisoner at the time. 'It's just a sad fact that the young Filipinos will never learn of what's happened until after his term.' '[Marcos Jr] has absolutely no concept of human rights,' added Nuval.

Eight people have been killed and over 200 wounded after pro-government supporters provoked violence among previously peaceful protests, which have been taking place for weeks in the midst of an unprecedented economic crisis.  On Tuesday, in a move that could lead to further bloodshed, the defence ministry said security forces had now 'been ordered to shoot on sight anyone looting public property or causing harm to life'. Earlier, demonstrations had continued as hundreds of anti-government protesters defied a nationwide curfew, gathering in the streets of Colombo and shouting slogans outside the office of the president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Mahinda Rajapaksa, the president's brother, had reluctantly stepped down in a bid to placate the protesters who have accused the government of mishandling the economy and bankrupting the country, but his resignation did little to calm public anger. Late on Monday night, protesters tried forced their way into Temple Trees, the prime minister's official residence, and attempted to storm the main two-storey building where Mahinda Rajapaksa was holed up with his family. 'After a pre-dawn operation, the former PM and his family were evacuated to safety by the army,' said a security official. 'At least 10 petrol bombs were thrown into the compound.' Mahinda Rajapaksa's removal to an undisclosed location followed a day of violent protests, with the homes of more than 40 pro-Rajapaksa politicians set on fire. Burned-out cars and buses littered the streets of Colombo on Tuesday. On Tuesday police kept up a barrage of teargas and fired warning shots in the air to hold back protesters at all three entrances to Temple Trees, where anti-government demonstrations have been taking place for weeks. The president declared a state of emergency over the weekend, giving sweeping powers of arrest to the military, as protests demanding his resignation escalated. Protesters and Sri Lankan religious leaders have blamed Rajapaksa supporters for turning the protests, which had been largely peaceful, into scenes of violence, which then spread across the country. Pro-Rajapaksa supporters, many bussed in from outside the city and armed with iron rods and sticks, violently attacked an anti-government protest site in Colombo on Monday, leaving almost 200 people injured. In two other separate incidents, politicians from the ruling party opened fire on anti-government protesters, killing three people and injuring at least five. Protesters gathered around the airports and set up checkpoints to make sure that none of the politicians from the ruling party attempted to flee Sri Lanka. Namal Rajapaksa, a son of the resigned prime minister, said the family had no intention of leaving. Gotabaya Rajapaksa urged people to 'remain calm and stop violence and acts of revenge against citizens, irrespective of political affiliations'. 'All efforts will be made to restore political stability through consensus, within constitutional mandate and to resolve economic crisis,' the president said in a tweet. The UN condemned the violence, with its high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, calling on the authorities to prevent further unrest. 'I am deeply troubled by the escalation of violence in Sri Lanka after supporters of the prime minister attacked peaceful protesters in Colombo yesterday, 9 May, and the subsequent mob violence against members of the ruling party,' Bachelet said on Tuesday. Sri Lanka's deepening economic crisis is the worst since independence in 1948, with its foreign reserves falling to record lows. The government has been unable to import food, fuel and medicines, leading to shortages of essentials, lengthy power cuts and fears of starvation. Protesters have been calling for both members of Sri Lanka's powerful Rajapaksa political dynasty to be removed from office, accusing them of financial impropriety and corruption, but Gotabaya Rajapaksa has repeatedly said he will not resign as president. His brother's resignation appeared to be an attempt to appease protesters, but the scenes in Colombo on Tuesday made it clear that many would not be satisfied until Gotabaya had also stepped down. The Rajapaksas have largely controlled Sri Lankan politics for two decades, but the economic crisis has challenged their grip on power in the face of mass unrest from people who had previously supported their brand of nationalist politics, which pandered to the Sinhalese Buddhist majority. With Mahinda Rajapaksa no longer prime minister, Sri Lanka's government has been dissolved. While the president has declared he intends to form a 'unity cabinet' with members of all political parties, the main opposition party stated that it would not help form a government until the president stepped down.", "ae87c5959e37dd61dc520fbd6c5b14a80a42c6e3732726500e9a0242": "Rebekah Vardy has said she deeply regrets making unflattering personal remarks about Peter Andre in a newspaper interview, as the multimillion pound 'Wagatha Christie' libel trial against Coleen Rooney got under way at the high court. The trial between the two footballer's wives is taking place in a wood-panelled Victorian-era courtroom in central London that has heard many important cases over the years - but this could be the first where physiological matters were discussed at such length. With the leaking of private information at the heart of the much-anticipated case, David Sherborne, acting for Coleen Rooney, asked Vardy whether she was the sort of person who leaked stories to the media. After Vardy said she was not, the lawyer began reading out excerpts from a 2004 interview Vardy once gave to the News of the World about a one-night stand she supposedly had with singer and entertainer Peter Andre. Sherborne quoted Vardy's words from the interview: 'Peter's hung like a small chipolata ... the smallest trouser equipment I've ever seen.' After Vardy confirmed she did not seek Andre's permission to reveal this personal detail in a national newspaper, the barrister asked: 'Did you feel particularly strongly about the size of his manhood that it should be made public?' Vardy insisted she 'deeply regrets' the incident and was coerced into giving the interview to the tabloid against her will by her ex-husband, an allegation the ex-husband has previously denied. The week-long trial pits the two wives of former England footballers - known as Wags - against each other. In 2019, Rooney conducted an elaborate sting operation to find out who was leaking stories from her private Instagram account to journalists at the Sun, ultimately making the public accusation that: 'It's............ Rebekah Vardy's account.' Vardy is now suing Rooney for libel, arguing that the accusation was false. After an earlier ruling, it is up to Rooney to prove Vardy was personally responsible for leaking stories to the Sun - or to convince the judge that publication of the allegation was in the public interest. Rooney and her husband, Wayne Rooney, looked on intently as Vardy gave evidence on Tuesday afternoon. Rooney's lawyers accepted they do not have a smoking gun that shows Vardy - the wife of the Leicester City player Jamie Vardy - actively leaking stories from Rooney's private Instagram account to the Sun. However, Sherborne told the court this did not matter due to the weight of circumstantial evidence against Vardy. 'In essence this is a detective story,' he said. 'Like any good detective story, you never find the person responsible standing over the body with the smoking gun in hand ... There's inference, circumstance, probability and likelihood and ultimately they all add up - so the finger will point to the right suspect or suspects.' In written submissions, Vardy's barrister, Hugh Tomlinson QC, denied his client had personally leaked any stories to the Sun, nor had she approved or condoned 'anyone else to do so on her behalf'. However, the court did hear Vardy has recently realised her former agent and close friend, Caroline Watt, may have briefed stories to the tabloid without her knowledge. Tomlinson said the 'candid' WhatsApp messages previously heard in court between Vardy and Watt showed that 'from time to time they did discuss 'leaking' information to the press'. But only one story - a drink-driving incident involving the Chelsea footballer Danny Drinkwater - was mentioned. As a result, Rooney simply 'can't establish that Mrs Vardy was responsible' for the leaks, Tomlinson told the court. He said that although the 'Wagatha Christie' case was being treated as a form of entertainment by much of the media, his client had been 'subjected to abuse and threats of a horrific nature' as a result of Rooney's allegedly false accusation. Rooney's legal team argue that Vardy and Watt made a concerted effort to destroy evidence, with a litany of technological accidents affecting the retrieval of WhatsApp messages. In one incident, Sheborne highlighted how a 'poor unfortunate phone' belonging to Watt was accidentally dropped off the side of a boat in the North Sea off the coast of Scotland within 'days' of a legal request to search it. In written submissions, Rooney's lawyers said these were not a series of 'unfortunate' incidents. Instead, they claimed the loss of data was part of a 'deliberate and calculated' campaign by Vardy and her team to dispose of potentially incriminating evidence - and prevent a fair trial. Sherborne said it did not make a difference if it was Vardy's agent who leaked stories to the Sun on behalf of the footballer's wife: 'It's like hiring a hitman or woman ... just because you're not the person who gets their hands dirty doesn't mean you're not equally responsible.' He concluded his opening remarks by suggesting the entire case against his client - and the millions of pounds spend on years of legal proceedings - was a pointless endeavour: 'This whole court might just think: 'Why on earth are we here?'' The case continues.", "80fe68d43045c3b72d5b3e334abb4333819c83c9e34da7f1d321ee26": "A Queen's speech without a queen; two future kings and a queen consort in waiting; the state opening of parliament was the most public and formal manifestation yet of 'Operation Transition', which has been quietly going on inside Buckingham Palace for several years. For the first time in two centuries, an heir to the throne read aloud the words compiled by the government at this most ceremonial of spectacles. The crucial difference between George IV, standing in for his mentally incapacitated father George III , and Prince Charles, seated not on the sovereign's throne but on the consort's throne once used by his father Prince Philip, is that the latter is not a formal regent. Charles, in Admiral of the Fleet uniform rather than the robes of state, the imperial state crown representative of sovereign placed on a table in front of where the Queen's throne would have been, was there as a counsellor of state. Flanked by the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke of Cambridge, he was instructed by his mother through Letters Patent, to perform this role and for this day only. The Queen, meanwhile, was understood to be watching on TV from Windsor Castle. But we do not, according to the constitutional expert Prof Vernon Bogdanor, have a 'de facto regency'. 'A regency requires three out of five dignitaries, the Prince of Wales, the lord chancellor, the Speaker of the Commons, the lord chief justice and the master of the rolls, to certify that the Queen is permanently - permanently - incapable of carrying out her duties. That judgment would no doubt be made on doctor's advice. There is no evidence that this is the case,' said Bogdanor, professor of government at King's College, London and author of The Monarchy and the Constitution. 'The criterion is objective. The Queen cannot simply say: 'I cannot carry out my duties.' A voluntary decision she could in theory take is abdication.' But this, he said, was unlikely given her pledge to the nation in 1947. Said by Buckingham Palace to experience 'episodic mobility issues', the Queen has cancelled many engagements over several months. With such uncertainty surrounding her physical capabilities, decisions are now being made on a day-to-day basis. The Letters Patent, issued under section 6(1) of the Regency Act 1937, are a useful instrument in such circumstances, allowing her to entrust counsellors of state to deputise as and when. 'The counsellors of state, unlike the regent, have no decision-making powers; in particular they cannot act on any matter on which the sovereign has the right to question government policy or to make suggestions about it. This is symbolised by the fact they can never act singly,' said Bogdanor. There are currently four: Charles, William, Harry and Andrew. The latter two are clearly problematic at present. And there are certain core constitutional functions that, unless there is a regency, cannot be delegated; such as appointing a prime minister, the weekly meeting with the PM and appointing and dismissing governor generals. The presence of William, attending his first state opening also as a counsellor of state, and Camilla, will be seen as by Buckingham Palace as demonstrating the crown is in safe hands as the Queen progressively withdraws from public life. 'She is very much in charge. Charles is deputising for her as he has done before,' said royal historian and author Robert Lacey. 'We are very far from regency. That implies a surrender of authority, which just isn't in her nature. She was born and grew up at the knee of the founder of the house of Windsor. She saw this system being created and she understood it instinctively when she called George V 'Grandpa England''. William's presence was 'significant', Lacey said, in demonstrating continuity. The Sussexes' decision to decamp to the US had resulted in Charles and William becoming closer than ever, he said. The Covid pandemic, too, may have made this transition easier. The Queen, who once said she has to be seen to be believed, may be spending most of her time at Windsor Castle, but has mastered the video technology to ensure she is still seen carrying out virtual engagements. 'So two possible disasters, the split between the brothers and the pandemic, actually work to the advantage of the new system in the future, bringing Charles and William together more as a team and giving the Queen a way to be seen that didn't exist before,' Lacey added. On the two previous occasions the Queen has missed state openings,in 1959 and 1963 due to pregnancy, the lord chancellor had read the government-drafted speech, as was the case when Queen Victoria did not attend. If that had been the case today, it would have meant Dominic Raab performing the duty. But the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 altered the role of lord chancellor, downgrading it from a position incorporating the role of Lord Speaker. 'The current lord chancellor is in the Commons. An alternative might have been the Lord Speaker of the Lords, Lord McFall. But the Prince of Wales gives the right degree of symbolism and pageantry to the occasion in my view,' said Bogdanor. 'Today was a constitutional innovation. But any solution would have been a constitutional innovation.'", "a925d01fd114f579bd2b92ac2fb885340febea7de9edf2ca57c75d09": "Vanuatu's push for the international court of justice to protect vulnerable nations from climate change has received the backing of 1,500 civil society organisations from more than 130 countries, as it heads toward a crucial vote at the UN General Assembly later this year. In 2021 Vanuatu announced its intention to seek an advisory opinion by the international court of justice on the rights of present and future generations to be protected from climate change. If it succeeds, the ICJ's advisory opinion - although non-binding - carries legal weight and moral authority which experts say could help shape international law. The opinion could also influence domestic and regional courts and tribunals when addressing issues relating to climate change. Vanuatu is trying to build support for its motion ahead of the UN General Assembly later this year, at which it needs to secure at least 97 votes, in order for the matter to be referred to the ICJ. The alliance, announced on Friday, represents more than 1,500 civil society organisations (CSOs) from across the globe, including preeminent climate groups from the Pacific: Climate Action Network - International, Greenpeace Australia Pacific, Oxfam in the Pacific, 350 Pacific, Pacific Islands Climate Action Network and Vanuatu Climate Action Network. An independent observer of Vanuatu's campaign said the alliance could put pressure on other nations to support Vanuatu's initiative.  'It throws the weight of these CSOs behind the initiative, which will put pressure on other states to support the initiative. There have been similar proposals before, which have been driven by other Pacific countries, like Palau in 2011, which have been derailed by pressure from rich countries, such as the United States,' said Fleur Ramsay, a Pacific islander lawyer specialising in climate and environmental law with the Environmental Defenders Office. Vanuatu has engaged a Pacific law firm, Blue Ocean Law, to represent them in their campaign for the advisory opinion and has retained external counsel to assist with the development of the legal strategy, including lawyers from the UK, the US, France, Canada, Greece, India, Switzerland and Fiji. Joseph Sikulu, Pacific Director of 350.org said the alliance was an extension of the important advocacy Pacific island nations have been doing on climate change for many years. 'The Pacific has already shown that governments and civil society can work together to achieve impactful change; the 1.5 degree benchmark being ingrained into the Paris Agreement is a testament to that. Through this alliance we hope to continue to weave together advocacy at all levels to build momentum behind the Vanuatu Government's push for this Advisory Opinion.' Vanuatu is one of the countries most affected by the climate crisis, with a combination of climate risks that include sea level and temperature rises, as well as extreme weather events including cyclones, storm surges, landslides, flooding and droughts. It is also among Pacific nations at the forefront of the climate fight. Vanuatu has been a vocal proponent in limiting temperature rise from global warming to 1.5C. The Pacific nation launched an online data modelling tool to perceive and prepare for potential impacts of rising tides and storm surges. It is are also experimenting with crossbreed crop varieties to identify climate resilient crops including taro. Vanuatu ratified the Paris Agreement in 2016 and is one of 43 nations on the Climate Vulnerable Forum. In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in September 2021, Vanuatu prime minister Bob Loughman said: 'The dire consequences of climate change can no longer be ignored, and the science linking climate change to past and present emissions of greenhouse gases is now beyond question. Climate change is driving sea level rise, desertification, disease redistribution, floods, unprecedented 'heat domes', cyclones, hurricanes, and other extreme weather events.'", "6273a2cca7884adf676af204d032f9c3c0eb447688d13bc64032ec20": "", "7b1f0f0e49a6264bc453dacc516dff5745b022fc5f65816d2d40f868": "", "49e3a59b2250fc9d261b600de75257b96f1bef014ee90d70b7469e06": "", "21ffe0b145cb43fa31ff7a29f1537d90c68037895aecfa54f8f0de86": "", "5c5f195a588a6efb793909264ad2a2a9e9fd29bce2a8bbe18acf193d": "", "a65db59abfbc6384cda73c82665077d111e9429025d5a47bb5e51785": "", "7c023f1dbc2c591d4b00e7d3807fb61ee6ae1cb799caf68b6557b3b4": "Name: Prince Harry: travel influencer.

He has left home, and seems to spend his life ambling around a foreign country without any clear direction, so I guess so. What does any of this have to do with him being a travel influencer? Almost nothing, but remember that job Harry got after leaving the royal family for the US? Chief impact officer at the mental health tech startup BetterUp? No, not that one, the other one. Netflix producer? Podcaster? Author? No, not any of those. His other job, the one where he's the head of ethical travel company Travalyst. No, I didn't know about that. It probably doesn't matter. What's important is that Harry has made a video with New Zealand actors, Rhys Darby and Dave Fane, where he imagines a world in which your holiday gives you a sustainability rating. What? Honestly, life's too short to explain, but essentially it shows Harry visiting New Zealand, where he is rated as a traveller. He scores points for turning off the tap while he brushes his teeth, for example, but loses points for accidentally littering on a beach. Oh no. Does he ... act? Yes, and here's the weird thing. He isn't bad. He isn't nearly as wooden or stilted as you might expect; at times he almost seems like a natural. How wonderful! What's his role? It seems to be 'dimwitted posho'. So, you know, not too demanding. Why is it set in New Zealand? That's easy. It's because Harry feels a deep connection with the Maori people. 'The Maori culture inherently understands sustainable practices and taking better care of our life-giving land, which are critical lessons we can all learn,' he said. Oh, the Indigenous people of New Zealand. That's right. Who found themselves enormously displaced in the 1800s. Yes, that's right. Because Prince Harry's relatives colonised it. Right, I think that's probably enough of that now, thank you very much. Incidentally, does going to Argentina and shooting a water buffalo count as sustainable travel? Look, fine, Prince Harry may not have a perfect history when it comes to travel, but the main thing is that he's trying. Hey, has anyone mentioned what a gigantic carbon footprint he has? It's many times higher than the national average, they say. Prince Harry has been clear on this. Sometimes, he has to make imperfect travel choices to protect his family. From climate change?

Researchers have described an onslaught of disinformation designed to revise history, enhance the reputation of the Marcoses and undermine their opponents. Many voters are not old enough to remember Marcos's rule, which ended in 1986, and academics warn that the period is not taught thoroughly in schools, creating a vulnerability the Marcoses and their backers have exploited. Many supporters say they do not believe the family has plundered state money, despite numerous court rulings. Some analysts say a Marcos election is a continuation of a populist wave that started with president Rodrigo Duterte and reflects frustration with previous administrations' failure to provide sufficient, tangible reforms following the People Power Revolution that ousted Marcos Sr. Duterte did not officially endorse Marcos as a presidential candidate, nor has he always been complimentary. Last year, Duterte called Marcos Jr a 'spoiled child' and 'weak leader', even as Marcos was campaigning on a joint ticket with his daughter. In a separate speech, he claimed a presidential candidate who had a prominent father, a thinly veiled reference to Marcos, was a cocaine user. During his presidency, however, Duterte has enabled the rehabilitation of the Marcos name, including by recommending Marcos Sr be given a hero's burial with military honours in 2016. 'The propagation of the myth of a golden age under the Marcos dictatorship played to his advantage while he was president,' said Sol Iglesias, assistant professor of political science at the University of the Philippines, who said such narratives were aligned with his own strongman leadership. 'But upon stepping down, his main interest would be avoiding accountability,' she added. Duterte's more recent jibes at Marcos may stem from an irritation that his daughter was running for the vice-presidency, and not the top job. Whoever is president will need to decide whether or not to cooperate with the international criminal court, which has launched an investigation into Duterte's so-called 'war on drugs'. Sara Duterte, 43, first attracted national attention a decade ago, when she punched a local sheriff four times in the head, in front of a crowd of reporters. She was then mayor of Davao City, on the southern island of Mindanao, where the family is extremely powerful. She has previously swapped places with her father as mayor of Davao, and held the role until earlier this year. A motorbike lover, she has the same tough style as her father. However, her rhetoric is less crude and extreme (he has called the pope a 'son of a whore', joked about rape, and once appeared to compare himself to Hitler). Many had anticipated that she would run for the presidency, and last year posters appeared across the country with the words: 'Run, Sara, run'. Running in tandem with Marcos brought together two of the Philippines' most powerful political families, and united their support bases in the north and south of the country. Their partnership reflects not just mutual preservation of their families, but of the broader system of political dynasties that dominate politics in the Philippines, said Iglesias, who referred to reports their partnership was brokered by the former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. 'If she hadn't brokered this tandem, they might have run against each other, and that would have cannibalised their mutually reinforcing bases,' said Iglesias. In such a scenario, victory might have been within the grasp of someone like the vice-president Leni Robredo, a candidate who had promised reform, including an anti-dynasty law. If the results from the initial vote count are confirmed, Marcos Jr will have a huge mandate. However, his campaign was thin on policy detail, and so analysts say it is not clear how he will use this advantage. Marcos may seek to change the 1987 constitution, said Iglesias. For example, he may try to change a rule that bars presidents from seeking re-election at the end of a six-year term. Marcos will inherit a challenging economic situation, added Sonny Africa, executive director of IBON Foundation. 'The last central bank data from the last quarter of 2021 showed that seven out of 10 families don't have any savings at all, whether in the bank or under their mattress,' he said, while huge numbers of small businesses have collapsed. However, the Marcos camp did not provide an overview of how it would tackle these problems, he added. Marcos has said that he would only allow visitors from the international criminal court to enter the country as tourists, preventing its prosecutors from investigating Duterte's 'war on drugs' in the country. He is also expected to pursue closer ties with China, continuing the policy of the Duterte administration.", "ad559a8142c01dfda516259645fd498a36e06818e82a76858b0a23d5": "Throughout the day, women with neatly tied buns slip out of a green door on to a narrow pavement just outside Krakow's medieval market. As young men in US army uniforms go by, trying to make sense of the maps on their phones, the women gather in a nook of a tall grey building to smoke hand-rolled cigarettes and chat. Before the invasion of Ukraine, the building was a hostel offering cheap accommodation to young Europeans Interrailing during their gap year. Now it is home to 80 Romany refugees from Ukraine, nearly all mothers with children. 'I just wish landlords would meet with us before they reject us,' says 42-year-old Nadia, who fled from her village near Donetsk when Russian bombs fell on her neighbour's house in March. She came to Poland with her son's wife, 22-year-old Raiia, her adult daughter, and with seven children between them. While the women have found work in a meat processing factory making hotdog sausages, like other Romany refugees they have hit a wall in finding a home. 'They face discrimination,' says Mariam Masudi a coordinator at the hostel, working for Salam Lab, an NGO. 'Roma are not admitted to other reception points. No one wants to rent to them. I don't know anyone who has managed to settle in Poland. Those who have been able to move out of the hostel have moved abroad.' The official number puts Ukraine's Roma population at 400,000, though experts see that as a low estimate. No one knows how many Ukrainian Roma have arrived in Poland, says Poland's civil rights deputy ombudsman, Hanna Machinska. 'These are large intergenerational families, some of 30 people. Most don't have a precise plan when they arrive in Poland,' she says. 'This situation requires institutional help. Individuals are not able to organise support for such large groups of people.' However, institutional help has not been forthcoming. Most of the relief has been coordinated by self-organised individuals and NGOs, says Joanna Talewicz-Kwiatkowska an anthropologist at the University of Warsaw, who organised the Facebook group, Poland-Roma-Ukraine at the start of the war. 'We wanted to gather information about people in need of help, communicate with central organs and find people ready to host Romany refugees,' she says. 'We didn't think that all responsibility for the situation would be shifted on to us.' Even Nadia's hostel has only been made possible by a private donor from the US who rented out the property until 15 May. That date can often be heard repeated with uncertainty among the women sitting in the hostel's lobby. 'And then what, they throw us out?' one woman says, as she kicks an invisible ball towards the door. This is a question that Karol Wilczynski, director of Salam Lab, cannot answer. 'Without governmental support, we will not manage. There is no way,' he says. Romany refugees face not only a lack of support but outright discrimination, both from relief providers and fellow Ukrainian refugees. The fact that much of the relief effort is provided by self-organised volunteers rather than the government means equal treatment of minorities is difficult to assert. 'In the first days of the war, we saw Poles make beautiful gestures of solidarity towards refugees from Ukraine,' says Talewicz-Kwiatkowska, who is a member of Poland's Roma. 'I would have never imagined we would be here talking about discrimination or dehumanisation, but that is what we are seeing.' According to Talewicz-Kwiatkowska, Roma have been refused access to transport and resources offered by the volunteers welcoming refugees at the border. 'Roma were chased away from reception points, where it was said they were stealing clothes to later sell. We also received information that Romany families and groups were turned away from cars and buses offering transport,' she says. 'Finding accommodation was another challenge, because when someone does not want to have Roma in their car, you can imagine they will not want to invite them under their own roof.' Masudi says that Roma fleeing Ukraine often face discrimination from other refugees. 'When they see Roma at the reception point, the other refugees loudly tell each other to hide their belongings. Roma in Ukraine are used to facing discrimination, and what they experience in Poland is the continuation of this,' she says. When Nadia arrived in Lviv, she says train station staff would not allow her and her family into the boarding area reserved for women and children hoping to travel to Poland. 'Ukrainian women were let in with their pets,' she says. 'But they didn't want to let me on. They didn't believe I was a refugee from Donetsk.' Only after she showed her papers, proving she had come from the east, was she allowed to board the train. 'But still, they wouldn't give me any of the food they were giving out to refugees,' she says. The best option for the Roma in the hostel would be to go west, Masudi says, to countries that are 'more diverse, where they would blend in'. While Talewicz-Kwiatkowska has been able to coordinate with Roma organisations in Sweden and Germany to organise accommodation, many are reluctant to take up the offers. 'They don't want to be far away from Ukraine - they hope they will be able to go back home soon,' she says. Others are afraid to trust foreign help. 'After the war in Yugoslavia, many Roma fell victims to organ sellers. Some are afraid of the situation repeating itself.' Nadia is aware of the stereotypes that follow her, but hopes, as she settles in Poland, she will be able to prove them false. 'When one Romany person steals something, or is fortune-telling, then people think we're all like that,' she says. 'But I don't know how to be a fortune-teller, so what can I do? All I know is how to work a job.'

'There's no telling what we'll find in Lake Mead,' said the former Las Vegas mayor Oscar Goodman on Monday. 'It's not a bad place to dump a body.' Goodman, as a lawyer, represented mob figures including the ill-fated Anthony 'Tony the Ant' Spilotro before serving three terms as a martini-toting mayor making public appearances with a showgirl on each arm. He declined to name names about who might turn up in the vast reservoir formed by the Hoover Dam between Nevada and Arizona. 'I'm relatively sure it was not Jimmy Hoffa,' he laughed. But he added that a lot of his former clients seemed interested in 'climate control' - mob speak for keeping the lake level up and bodies down in their watery graves. Instead, the world now has climate change, and the surface of Lake Mead has dropped more than 170ft (52 meters) since 1983. The lake that slakes the thirst of 40 million people in cities, farms and tribes across seven south-western states is down to about 30% of capacity. 'If the lake goes down much farther, it's very possible we're going to have some very interesting things surface,' observed Michael Green, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas history professor whose father dealt blackjack for decades at casinos including the Stardust and the Showboat. 'I wouldn't bet the mortgage that we're going to solve who killed Bugsy Siegel,' Green said, referring to the infamous gangster who opened the Flamingo in 1944 on what would become the Strip. Siegel was shot dead in 1947 in Beverly Hills. His assassin has never been identified. 'But I would be willing to bet there are going to be a few more bodies,' Green said. First, the dropping lake level exposed Las Vegas's uppermost drinking water intake on 25 April, forcing the regional water authority to switch to a deep-lake intake it completed in 2020 to continue to supply casinos, suburbs and 2.4 million residents and 40 million tourists a year. The following weekend, boaters spotted the decomposed body of a man in a rusted barrel stuck in the mud of newly exposed shoreline. The corpse has not been identified, but Las Vegas police say he had been shot, probably between the mid-1970s and the early 1980s, according to the shoes found with him. The death is being investigated as a homicide. A few days later, a second barrel was found by a KLAS-TV news crew, not far from the first. It was empty. On Saturday, two sisters from suburban Henderson who were paddle boarding on the lake near a former marina resort noticed bones on a newly surfaced sand bar. Lindsey Melvin, who took photos of their find, said they thought at first it was the skeleton of a bighorn sheep native to the region. A closer look revealed a human jaw with teeth. They called park rangers, and the National Park Service confirmed in a statement that the bones were human. There was no immediate evidence of foul play, Las Vegas police said on Monday, and they are not investigating. A homicide investigation would be opened if the Clark county coroner determines the death was suspicious, the department said in a statement. More bodies will be discovered, predicted Geoff Schumacher, the vice-president of the Mob Museum, a renovated historic downtown Las Vegas post office and federal building that opened in 2012 as the National Museum of Organized Crime and Law Enforcement. 'I think a lot of these individuals will likely have been drowning victims,' Schumacher said, referring to boaters and swimmers who have never been found. 'But a barrel has a signature of a mob hit. Stuffing a body in a barrel. Sometimes they would dump it in the water.' He and Green both cited the death of John 'Handsome Johnny' Roselli, a mid-1950s Las Vegas mobster who disappeared in 1976 a few days before his body was found in a 55-gallon (208-liter) steel drum floating off the coast of Miami. David Kohlmeier, a former police officer who now co-hosts a Las Vegas podcast and fledgling TV show called The Problem Solver Show, said on Monday that after offering a $5,000 reward last week for qualified divers to find barrels in the lake, he heard from people in San Diego and Florida willing to try. But National Park Service officials said that is not allowed, and that there are hundreds of barrels in the depths - some dating to the construction of Hoover Dam in the 1930s. Kohlmeier said he also heard from families of missing people and about cases like a man suspected of killing his mother and brother in 1987, a hotel employee who disappeared in 1992, and a father from Utah who vanished in the 1980s. 'You'll probably find remains all throughout Lake Mead,' Kohlmeier said, including Native Americans who were the area's earliest inhabitants. Green said the discoveries have people talking not only about mob hits, but about bringing relief and closure to grieving families.  'People will talk about this for the right reasons and the wrong reasons,' the professor said. 'They're going to think we're going to solve every mob murder ... But it's also worth remembering that the mob did not like murders to take place in the Las Vegas area, because they did not like bad publicity going out under the Las Vegas dateline.' The right reason, Green said, is the visible evidence that the west has a serious water problem. 'The 'bathtub ring' around the lake is big and getting bigger,' he said.  Whatever story emerges about the body in the barrel, Goodman predicted it will add to the lore of a city that, with lake water, sprouted from a creosote bush-covered desert to become a marquee gambling mecca. 'When I was the mayor, every time I went to a groundbreaking, I'd begin to shake for fear that somebody I may have run into over the years will be uncovered,' he said. 'We have a very interesting background,' Goodman added. 'It certainly adds to the mystique of Las Vegas.'", "0d87359e9bab8ea4864bd109330cee0cc6adf250d653f6290037bb11": "The pandemic turned the US into a next-day delivery nation. Amazon, in particular, saw sales surge during the dark days of Covid. In the first three months of 2021, the company watched its total sales tick up by 44%, constituting $8.1bn in profit. Those sales were led by the 200 million subscribers to Amazon's super-fast delivery service Prime as people demanded everything from desk chairs to bananas delivered the next day. Amazon sold 44% more items during the pandemic, but the cost of fulfilling those orders increased by only 31%. This saving was one of scale - high-order volume allowed Amazon to operate even more efficiently. 'It has run its warehouses closer to full capacity, and delivery drivers have made more stops on their routes, with less time driving between customers,' reported the New York Times. During that period of lockdowns, Amazon's quick delivery became a lifeline for many people. But as we approach a return to a more normal life, many of us are investigating the various habits and proclivities we unconsciously established during Covid. Do we want to go back to the office? Are we satisfied with our current employment situation? And is the endless cycle of cardboard arriving at our doorsteps putting an undue strain on the planet, on our infrastructure, and on the human spirit? Amazon Prime ships about 1.6m packages a day. That operation is buoyed by a worldwide logistics team which rumbles all day and night. Isn't that a little gluttonous? Or, as M Sanjayan, CEO of Conservation International, put it in an interview with NPR: 'You don't need a pair of socks to get to you swiftly. It probably makes just as much sense to get it to you efficiently.' For Amazon workers, this means working at an extraordinary pace. Jacob, who joined Amazon two years ago, says he has logged a total of 30,000 miles, and 400 routes. He is frequently saddled with shifts that force him to deliver to '70 separate three-story buildings' with more than 350 packages. 'I was logging over 120 flights of stairs on my Fitbit,' he tells the Guardian. 'Amazon constantly reminds us they put profits over their workers,' he says. 'I ended up having a normal 200-plus stop day on Easter Sunday. Zero mercy shown.' The physical toll bears out in the data. According to a survey of workers in a Long Island Amazon warehouse, 42% reported physical pain in their day-to-day duties - usually in the feet and lower back. (They also noted psychological pressures and a deterioration of their normal sleep schedules.) 'I do feel like the workload is unreasonable,' says another driver interviewed by the Guardian, who asked to remain anonymous. 'There is no time to break. It is impossible to complete a route, and take your breaks, and be back to the station in time.' In the past eight years there have been hundreds of accidents involving Amazon vehicles, including at least six deaths, which were documented in BuzzFeed News investigation in 2019. But it is difficult to know the exact figures, given the way Amazon outsources its delivery apparatus to a worldwide network of companies. In total, BuzzFeed identified at least 250 outsourced dispatchers who work with Amazon. In many cities Amazon is promising packages in as little as five hours, or tells customers they can order by midnight and receive products the next morning. Would more time to make deliveries lead to a more equitable work environment? Jacob says an earlier cutoff for next-day delivery orders could give Amazon employees more time to breathe, but he also isn't sure if customers would accept having to wait longer. 'The standard has been raised,' he says. There are also questions about how sustainable this relentless pace is within the climate emergency. There are two differing philosophies about the emission impact of next-day delivery. Some argue that by streamlining the flow of products - bundling up all of our assorted consumption needs into parcels on a shared conveyor belt - we are taking the cars off the road that would previously be making routine trips to local strip malls. 'The question is always, 'What are we replacing?'' says Miguel Jaller, a professor at UC Davis and co-director of the Sustainable Freight Research program. 'If you're replacing a two-gallon-per-mile large SUV going every day to a store far away, then we're benefiting the environment.' Amazon has claimed it will reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 (and has already made some strides in that arena - they remain the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy). But given the sheer diversity of items available on Amazon and other e-commerce retailers, experts say it becomes more difficult to assert that next-day delivery streamlines the supply chain. The average Prime order might constitute radically different items, which are both guaranteed to make it to your doorstep in 24 hours or less. 'It gets harder to consolidate,' Anne Goodchild, a professor of engineering at the University of Washington, told Vox. 'I think it's easy to overlook how much travel we're adding.' This is complicated further by Amazon's reliance on contract labor, many of which use trucks that are considerably smaller than the giant 18-wheelers that haul fresh stock to bricks-and-mortar retailers, and generally carry a much heavier carbon footprint given their limited storage space. (In total, those vehicles are responsible for one0quarter of all carbon emissions in the transportation category.) In general, Jaller is unconvinced that the industry's continued focus on speed above everything lends itself to a carbon-neutral model. 'They started pushing one-day delivery and then they started pushing one-hour delivery. The faster you're providing a service, the less likely you're able to be [environmentally] efficient,' he says. Jaller does recommend a few remediesincluding a pivot to zero-emission vehicles. But generally speaking, experts believe that the path towards a sustainable, livable, non-exploitative future must begin with a shift in our social priorities. 'It's not a massive chunk of your total environmental impact, but every decision a consumer makes has some impact,' says Austin Whitman, CEO of the non-profit Climate Neutral, when I asked him if he believes next-day delivery can coexist within the ethical posture of any conscious shopper. 'Should you put it on your list of the top 10 things to avoid? Absolutely.' Kai Lendwehr, the press officer of the environmental non-profit MyClimate, agrees. He advocates for a reorientation in the relentless parameters of consumption. Instead of searching for a supply-chain apparatus that sustainably satiates our demands, maybe we simply need to be wondering if we truly need the things we're purchasing in the first place. 'It's about conscious buying,' he says. 'Decide what you need, do some research, focus on quality, on things that make you feel suitable for a longer timeframe, and then click the green button. It shouldn't really matter when the product arrives.'", "c4ca2664ac7c91a02f3f7b49042f192d7c0722d058ba99615cc47dfa": "'You put your babies in the womb, you will be held accountable!' yelled Steve Corson, tall, bearded and jabbing a finger at women who chanted back: 'My body, my choice!' Corson took a deep breath and blew into a shofar. Then Nathan Darnell, wearing a 'Jesus Christ is king' cap and holding aloft a cross, grabbed a megaphone. 'You guys are demon-possessed!' declared the 19-year-old from Haymarket, Virginia. 'You guys are controlled by demons, all of you. Every child has a right to life.' Suddenly Darnell was surrounded by abortion rights protesters brandishing placards. He kept talking. 'You guys are evil. The downfall of America is because of every one of you.' The national day of prayer last Thursday was anything but a solemn occasion outside the supreme court in Washington, where hours earlier an unscalable black fence had been erected, reminiscent of the one that surrounded the US Capitol after the January 6 insurrection. The fury was unleashed by a leaked draft opinion that showed the nation's highest court provisionally voted to overturn Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling that effectively legalised abortion. It was a political earthquake that revealed American women are perilously close to losing a fundamental right. It was also a milestone in America's seemingly inexorable journey from United States to divided states. The likely demise of Roe v Wade could drive the biggest wedge yet between what appear to be two irreconcilable nations coexisting under one flag. Liberal states would become sanctuaries for women seeking abortions and saturated with providers; conservative states would turn into deserts that ban the procedure and criminalise doctors who provide it. Some wonder if the country's social fabric, frayed by four years of Donald Trump's presidency, can survive. 'The death of Roe is going to tear America apart,' ran the headline of a New York Times column by Michelle Goldberg, which concluded that 'the death of Roe will intensify our national animus, turning red states and blue into mutually hostile legal territories. You think we hate each other now? Just wait until the new round of lawsuits start.' Simon Schama, a historian, tweeted: 'When Roe vs Wade is overturned it will be time to find a different name for this country.' The supreme court's draft majority opinion, written by Samuel Alito and circulated on 10 February, was leaked to Politico on Monday. It argued in contemptuous tones that Roe v Wade 'was egregiously wrong from the start' and 'enflamed debate and deepened division'. Four other Republican-appointed justices - Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett - agreed that Roe 'must be overruled'. If that decision becomes final, possibly next month, it will tear down a national precedent and turn America into a chaotic legal patchwork. The first restrictions would take effect in 13 states with so-called trigger laws to be enacted once Roe is overturned. Some such laws ban abortions almost completely while others would outlaw it after six or 15 weeks. The speed of trigger laws could vary. In Texas, a near-total ban would go into effect 30 days after a supreme court decision. The Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organisation, estimates that 26 of 50 states are certain or likely to ban abortion if Roe is overturned, leaving women in swaths of the south-west and midwest without access. In 11 states there would be no exemptions for rape and incest. Republicans in Louisiana are even considering a bill that would allow prosecutors to charge those having abortions with homicide. Most states where abortion would still be legal are on the west coast or in the north-east. The California governor, Gavin Newsom, on Monday proposed enshrining a right to abortion in the state constitution. In Oregon, Democrats recently passed a bill to create a $15m fund to assist with the costs of abortion, including for women from outside the state. Women might have to travel hundreds of miles to get an abortion. This is likely to be especially difficult for women in poverty, often including women of colour, and lead to a sharp climb in unsafe abortions. Republican-led states have already made efforts to restrict abortion pills, which can be prescribed through online visits. There have been fierce disputes over healthcare, immigration and race in recent years - the journalist Carl Bernstein has spoken of a 'cold civil war' - but few can match the raw emotional power of reproductive rights. That much was clear outside the fortified supreme court on Thursday, as two vociferous groups faced off. Rev Patrick Mahoney, director of the Christian Defense Coalition, said into a microphone: 'We look forward to the day when abortion ends up on the scrap heap of history like chattel slavery and segregation.' Rochelle Rubin, about 20 paces away, shouted: 'You don't have a uterus! Shut up!' Her voice shaking, Rubin, 50, an estate agent and lawyer, explained later: 'This is personal for me. I was born the last year that women could not have abortions. My mother had no choice. Had she made the choice she would have had me, but women of her generation did not have choice. 'If I didn't have a choice, my life would be very different today than it would have been. Ten years years ago I exercised my choice and had an abortion. For 50 years you can have a right - and it could be taken away by five people.' Even as abortion rights activists shouted 'Keep your rosaries off my ovaries!' and held placards such as 'Women's bodies are more regulated than guns', Mahoney said he was 'overjoyed' by the draft opinion but acknowledged the societal shockwaves. He said: 'Can America get any more divided than we are? Tragically, yes it can. We certainly saw that happen on January 6, which was tragic. I would say we have to find a way to address this. Let's deal locally so if you have California on one end and Alabama on another end, let's just work on that.' Mahoney, 68, added: 'What you see on the streets is the cutting edge of the cultural fault lines that we see in our country. We saw that with the tragic murder of George Floyd. But our nation went through this upheaval and we're moving forward so that's what I hope happens here.' The interview was repeatedly interrupted as Mahoney broke off to restrain fellow anti-abortion activists from confronting female protesters. 'That's not who we are,' he said, and it was true that women from the opposing sides engaged in civil conversations while in fundamental disagreement. But Corson, 65, from Fredonia, Arizona, gripping his shofar and the Stars and Stripes, was more aggressive. He said: 'I don't respect their view at all. They didn't come out with 'My body, my choice' when it came to the [Covid] vaccine. 'They have a human body inside them; we speak for that human body; they're just speaking for themselves. I get sick and tired of these people. They are very corrupt and evil and on the wrong side. It is going to get heated up, no doubt about it. It should. It's a good issue to get heated up about.' The great divide on abortion is not a 50-50 split. It is asymmetric. A poll released by the Data for Progress thinktank after this week's leak showed voters wanted to keep Roe by a two-to-one margin. Democrats, independents and more than a third of Republicans support it. Its imminent fall is due to a quirk of US democracy that skews the electoral college, Senate and supreme court out of kilter with the popular will. Justices Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Coney Barrett were appointed by Trump, who lost the national popular vote by 3m, after Senate Republicans blocked Barack Obama's last nominee, Merrick Garland. This sense of injustice at this democratic deficit - which gives significantly more representation to white citizens than citizens of colour - is only likely to incite anger and dissent as blue states go one way and red states go the other. Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said: 'The basic structure of politics with all these small rural states being essentially overrepresented is creating the situation where minorities can control the majority. People are going to be furious about it. 'Already friends of mine in New York City talk about not letting their tax dollars go to red states because the irony is that all the blue states send more money to the federal government than they get back and the goddam red states take all the money and then try to run the lives of everybody in the blue states. 'So there really is a war going on and it's a cultural war but it's one that they [Republicans] are destined to lose.' If Roe is struck down, Kamarck noted, it will be the clearest differentiation of rights by state since the era of Jim Crow, when some states racially segregated public places and others did not. This could be a recipe for battles over sovereignty, with red states passing laws to 'extradite' anyone who helps their residents get an abortion and blue states passing laws to shield their own doctors. States have been drifting apart for years, across fault lines characterised as liberal v conservative, Black v white, urban v rural, college-educated v blue collar, Hollywood v heartland, mask wearers v vaccine sceptics and MSNBC v Fox News. The 2016 presidential election was framed as Trump's 'deplorables' against Hillary Clinton's 'coastal elites'. The supreme court looks ready to toss a grenade into the mix. Barbara Walter, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, and author of How Civil Wars Start: And How to Stop Them, said: 'What I fear will happen is that it will further create this urban-rural divide where the more moderate and liberal voices in red states will move, or their children will move, because they will not want their rights restricted. 'If you're a big corporation that employs a lot of women, are you going to move to states where they and their daughters are not treated equally or they're under these increasingly restrictive and medieval laws?' The fight is under way. A liberal group published the addresses of conservative supreme court justices and encouraged protesters to walk by them. A day of action for abortion rights is planned for Saturday. The issue could also galvanise Democratic turnout in November's midterm elections. Eric Swalwell, a Democratic congressman from California, said: 'There will be an effort to turn out young women and their male allies when that decision comes. I hope it doesn't have to happen but I think it's going to be the backfire of the century for Republicans.' The Senate will vote on legislation that would codify abortion rights into federal law but Democrats do not have 60 votes to overcome a Republican filibuster, which means the Joe Biden-backed effort will fail. There have never been so few Republicans who support abortion rights, nor have there ever been so few Democrats who call themselves 'pro-life'. Fareed Zakaria, an author and broadcaster, warned in the Washington Post: 'You cannot really understand America anymore by looking at averages. It has become two countries. One is urban, more educated, multiracial, secular and largely left of center. The other is rural, less educated, religious, white and largely right of center.' Blue America would fit comfortably with northern European Protestant countries, Zakaria said, while red America's cultural values make it closer to Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. 'For the country's political future, the central question is now this: can these two Americas find a way to live, work, cooperate with and tolerate one another? If not, the abortion battle may be the precursor to even larger struggles.'", "01b590f231e045c10309aac88994ad9c804491b87a02ae8e17183151": "It was in 1986 that the dictator Ferdinand Marcos and his family were forced to leave the Philippines in disgrace. Helicopters airlifted the family from the Malacanang Palace, as protesters filled the streets. Marcos Sr, after ruling with an iron fist for 20 years, had been toppled by a popular uprising, the People Power Revolution. Crowds stormed the abandoned palace, discovering the extent of the family's opulence. There were grand artworks, boxes of commemorative gold coins, lavish jewellery, hundreds of gowns, dresses, and, infamously, an enormous collection of designer shoes belonging to the former first lady, Imelda Marcos. Analysts say that, ever since the family was ousted, it has been intent on forging a comeback. In the documentary The Kingmaker, Imelda Marcos described it as her son's destiny to become the president. Now he is on the cusp of doing so. Ferdinand Marcos Jr, 'known as Bongbong', was educated in the Philippines and at a boarding school in England. An extract from Marcos Sr's diary suggests the family was concerned his son lacked the 'character' needed for the future. 'Bongbong is our principal worry. He is too carefree and lazy,' he writes, adding later: 'I have told him that since we have enemies, he will have to fight the battles I fought in the past against myself and against circumstance.' Marcos Jr began studying politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford, but, according to the university, did not complete a degree course and was awarded a special diploma in social sciences. Marcos insists he graduated with the equivalent of a degree. After university, Marcos Jr became the vice-governor of his home province, Ilocos Norte, on the north-western tip of Luzon, at the age of 23 and later governor. He was 29 when his father was ousted and the family was forced to leave the Philippines. Marcos Sr died in exile in 1989. However, the family was allowed to return to the country in the 1990s. Marcos Jr then began to re-establish his political career, again becoming governor in Ilocos Norte, the family's stronghold, a congressman and a senator. In 2016, he ran for vice-president but lost to Leni Robredo - an outcome he unsuccessfully challenged in court. Robredo lost to him in the 2022 presidential race. Marcos is married to the lawyer Louise Araneta-Marcos, known as Liza, with whom he has three sons. The eldest, Ferdinand Alexander Marcos III, known as Sandro, is running for the first district congressional seat of Ilocos Norte, and has developed a prominent social media presence where he is received adoringly by young female supporters. The family continues to face numerous court cases over their plundered wealth, which is estimated to be as high as $10bn. Imelda is appealing against a 2018 criminal conviction on seven corruption charges. Marcos Jr has been unapologetic about his family's past and has downplayed or denied abuses under his father's rule. He praised his father as a 'political genius', and his mother as the dynasty's 'supreme politician' during a recent interview with CNN Philippines. Under martial law, which was imposed by Marcos in 1972, thousands of Marcos critics were arrested, tortured and killed. Marcos Jr's camp, and its supporters, have portrayed the Marcos years as a time when the country was thriving and prosperous. Online misinformation about the era has inundated social media, prompting media groups and academics to form factchecking initiatives. Marcos Jr's appeal has relied on nostalgia relating to his father's rule, say analysts. 'He did not inherit the political savvy or the appeal or the charm of the father,' said Prof Maria Ela L Atienza, who teaches political science at the University of the Philippines. 'He's basically living off or campaigning on the basis of the name of the father.' His campaign, which carried the slogan 'together we shall rise again', promised unity and a return to what he has portrayed to be a former greatness. He has also pledged to prioritise jobs and lower the cost of living, including bringing down the cost of rice, though critics say such proposals are lacking in detail. His opponents fear the return of the family to power could lead to the reversal of democratic gains made in the country since his father was toppled in 1986.", "c3587315d4639d4abd7d36dedc0dcc016f6e48c30c56ede896cfc126": "Nature charity Plantlife is asking people to not mow their lawns in May as part of the No Mow May campaign to keep gardens wild and encourage wilder lawns.

He also cautioned against expecting 'certain victories'.  He said:  Thank you for following our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This blog has now closed. You can find our latest coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war in our new live blog in the link below. Here are some of the latest images to come across our newswires today out of Ukraine. The US House of Representatives has approved more than $40bn in aid for Ukraine. The House passed the Ukraine spending bill by 368 to 57 on Tuesday evening, with every 'no' vote coming from Republicans, according to a Reuters report. The measure now heads to the Senate, which is expected to act quickly. President Joe Biden had asked Congress to approve an additional $33bn in aid for Ukraine two weeks ago, but lawmakers decided to increase the military and humanitarian funding. 'This bill will protect democracy, limit Russian aggression, and strengthen our own national security, while, most importantly, supporting Ukraine,' Democratic Representative Rosa DeLauro, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, said. Some Republicans opposed the bill, criticising Democrats for moving too quickly to send too many US taxpayer dollars abroad. Biden's fellow Democrats narrowly control Congress, but the bill will need Republican votes to get through the Senate. The package includes $6bn for security assistance, including training, equipment, weapons and support; $8.7bn to replenish stocks of US equipment sent to Ukraine, and $3.9bn for European Command operations. In addition, the legislation authorises a further $11bn in Presidential Drawdown Authority, which allows the president to authorise the transfer of articles and services from US stocks without congressional approval in response to an emergency. Biden had asked for $5bn. It also authorizes $4bn in Foreign Military Financing to provide support for Ukraine and other countries affected by the crisis. The United States has so far rushed more than $3.5bn worth of armaments to Ukraine since Russia invaded, including howitzers, anti-aircraft Stinger systems, anti-tank Javelin missiles, ammunition and recently-disclosed 'Ghost' drones.  The UN General Assembly voted overwhelmingly Tuesday for the Czech Republic to replace Russia on the world organisation's leading human rights body following its suspension over allegations of horrific rights violations by Russian soldiers in Ukraine. In Tuesday's secret ballot vote, 180 of the General Assembly's 193 members deposited ballots. The result was 157 countries in favour of the Czech Republic and 23 abstentions, the Associated Press reports.  The assembly approved a US-initiated resolution on 7 April to suspend Russia from the Human Rights Council by a vote of 93-24 with 58 abstentions.  Rescuers say they have found the bodies of 44 civilians under the rubble of a destroyed building in the eastern Ukrainian town of Izyum, now under Russian control. 'The bodies of 44 civilians were found in Izyum under the rubble of a five-storey building which was destroyed by the occupiers in early March,' Oleg Synegubov, governor of the eastern Kharkiv region, said in an update via the Telegram messaging app. Although fighting continues in the area, local media quoted him as saying residents had made the discovery while clearing the rubble from an area 'where there is no shelling', according to a report from Agence France-Presse. Synegubov did not say who had removed the bodies nor how they had managed to do so. Separately, the regional prosecutor's office said it had opened an investigation into 'the violation of the laws and customs of war' following the discovery, saying that 14 of the bodies had already been identified. 'According to the investigation, the Russian military systematically shelled Izyum between March 7-10. As a result, public infrastructure and residential buildings were destroyed,' it said on Telegram. Ukraine has been voted through to the grand final in the Eurovision Song Contest.  At the end of their semi-final performance, the folk-rap group thanked everyone for supporting their country amid the Russian invasion.  The group had been unable to meet and rehearse regularly and were only able to get together about six weeks before Tuesday night's performance. Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills, who was commentating for the BBC coverage of the semi-final, said: 'Frontman Oleg joked that he doesn't think the lack of rehearsal time will affect their performance because they're very attractive men.' The Ukrainian act is the favourite to win. The competition's producers previously announced Russia will no longer participate in this year's contest following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  As Russian troops continue their assault of the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol, a photo-journalist has revealed the extent of the suffering and life for those wounded who remain inside. In a series of harrowing images, a photographer with the press office of the Azov Special Forces Regiment of the Ukrainian National Guard has unveiled the horror of the dimly-lit, makeshift 'hospitals' inside the plant where soldiers receive treatment, many for lost limbs. A Ukrainian soldier inside the besieged Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol has spoken of the harrowing conditions from inside the plant, revealing the remaining defenders are 'taking heavy casualties' as the Russians continue their assault. Lieutenant Illya Samoilenko, a member of the Azov Regiment, told Sky News that the count of injured and fallen soldiers is 'very high' and the servicemen deserve proper care. Ukrainian officials believe around 100 civilians remain at the site, but Samoilenko said that, as far as he knows, they were all evacuated. He added that those at the site have 'extremely limited resources,' and they believe that 'every day may be our last'. 'The result of this might be... [being captured] by the enemy, which means death for us,' he added. 'Our life means nothing, but our fight means everything.' Ukrainian soldiers have shown the squalid conditions in which they are currently living while trapped and wounded holed up under the Azovstal steel works plant in besieged Mariupol. A series of photos were published on the Azov Regiment's Telegram channel early this morning, alongside a plea to the international community for help. The regiment pleaded for the 'immediate evacuation of wounded servicemen to Ukrainian-controlled territories' where they could be assisted and provided with proper care. Returning to the decisive issue of gas, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov visited gas-producing ally Algeria for talks on Tuesday as Europe scrambles to secure alternative energy supplies. Algeria is a major gas supplier to Europe, providing 11% of its imports, compared with 47% from Russia, according to figures cited by the Associated Press. Italy, Spain and other European Union member countries have looked to Algeria as they seek to cut their dependence on Russian oil and gas. However, Algeria has repeatedly stressed that it lacks the capacity to meet such demand in the short-term. 'We very much appreciate Algeria's considered, objective and balanced position on the Ukrainian question,' Lavrov told journalists after meeting his counterpart Ramtane Lamamra and President Abdelmadjid Tebboune.  Asked about Algeria's gas deliveries, Lavrov said that Russia, Algeria and other gas exporters 'believe we should respect deals that have already been reached'. Lavrov added that the two sides had discussed 'bolstering military and technical cooperation'. Footage from the chaos inflicted on Odesa after one person was killed and five injured when seven missiles hit a shopping centre and a depot in Odesa has emerged showing burning buildings and rescue workers sorting through debris.  Air raid sirens sounded as the missiles interrupted a meeting between Charles Michel, president of the European Council, and the Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, forcing them into a bomb shelter on Monday. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged the international community to take immediate steps to end a Russian blockade of his country's ports in order to allow wheat shipments and prevent a global food crisis. Watch the footage below. Ukraine has said it will suspend the flow of gas through a transit point which it says delivers almost a third of the fuel piped from Russia to Europe through Ukraine, blaming Moscow for the move and saying it would move the flows elsewhere. Ukraine has remained a major transit route for Russian gas to Europe even throughout Russia's war in Ukraine. GTSOU, which operates Ukraine's gas system, said it would stop shipments via the Sokhranivka route from Wednesday, declaring 'force majeure', a clause invoked when a business is hit by something beyond its control, Reuters reports. But Gazprom, which has a monopoly on Russian gas exports by pipeline, said it was 'technologically impossible' to shift all volumes to the Sudzha interconnection point further west, as GTSOU proposed. GTSOU CEO Sergiy Makogon told Reuters that Russian occupying forces had started taking gas transiting through Ukraine and sending it to two Russia-backed separatist regions in the country's east. He did not cite evidence. The company said it could not operate at the Novopskov gas compressor station due to 'the interference of the occupying forces in technical processes', adding it could temporarily shift the affected flow to the Sudzha physical interconnection point located in territory controlled by Ukraine. Ukraine's suspension of Russian natural gas flows through the Sokhranivka route should not have an impact on the domestic Ukrainian market, state energy firm Naftogaz head Yuriy Vitrenko told Reuters. The state gas company in Moldova, a small nation on Ukraine's western border, said it had not received any notice from GTSOU or Gazprom that supplies would be interrupted.", "5fb03def5d427c832e5daa1b84b2ee322cc16ee4e16ad1b4e43d934b": "The head of the UN human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine has warned that the civilian death toll in Ukraine is thousands higher than the official toll of 3,381, with deaths in the port city of Mariupol alone likely to add significantly to the total. 'We have been working on estimates, but all I can say for now is that it is thousands higher than the numbers we have currently given to you,' Matilda Bogner, the head of the UN human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine, told a press briefing in Geneva, when asked about the total number of deaths and injuries. 'The big black hole is really Mariupol, where it has been difficult for us to fully access and to get fully corroborated information,' she said. The warning was delivered as dozens more bodies were discovered in the ruins of a burnt out and collapsed five-storey building in Izium in the Kharkiv region, and as the UN migration agency said 8 million people were internally displaced inside Ukraine by the conflict. 'This is another horrible war crime of the Russian occupiers against the civilian population!' Oleh Synehubov, the head of Kharkiv's regional administration, said in a social media message announcing the deaths. As both Ukrainian and Russian military officials claimed advances in the battles for the country's south and east, dominated by a 300-mile-long frontline, the latest phase of the campaign appeared to have settled for now into a grim back and forth struggle over shell smashed villages and small towns. In the Kharkiv area in particular, the conflict has turned into a long-range shelling war between the two sides. After unexpectedly fierce resistance forced the Kremlin to abandon its effort to storm Kyiv more than a month ago, Moscow's forces have concentrated on capturing the Donbas, Ukraine's eastern industrial region. Further west, Ukraine's vital Black Sea port of Odesa came under repeated missile attack, including from some hypersonic missiles, after Russia marked its biggest patriotic holiday without giving new information about the war. One person was killed and five were wounded, the military said. As part of the barrage, a Russian supersonic bomber fired three hypersonic missiles, according to the Center for Defence Strategies, a Ukrainian thinktank tracking the war. The centre identified the weapons used as Kinzhal - or 'Dagger' - hypersonic air-to-surface missiles although there was no independent verification of what missiles were used. The strikes on Odesa come amid warnings from the Ukrainian military's general staff of an elevated missile threat across the country, including claims Russia has increased the number of naval missile carriers operating in the Black Sea. With the conflict on both sides being defined by intense Russian shelling by artillery and rocket systems, CNN quoted an unnamed defence official on Monday saying the Ukraine military had received 85 of 90 M777 long-range field howitzers promised by the US, along with 100,000 rounds of artillery ammunition out of 184,000 promised. The defence official said the US military in Europe completed the training of 310 Ukrainian service personnel in handling howitzers with a further 50 undergoing training. In Mariupol itself, fierce fighting was continuing around the area of the Azovstal steel mill where about 2,000 Ukrainian defenders are still holding out. Despite claims that all civilians who had been sheltering there had been evacuated, it was claimed on Tuesday about 100 were still inside the sprawling plant. One of the Ukrainian fighters holding out at the steel plant said they were still defending the city. Valeri Paditel, who heads the border guards in the Donetsk region, said the fighters were 'doing everything to make those who defend the city in the future proud'. While assessments by western defence and intelligence officials, as well as military analysts have focused on the shortcomings of the Russian operation and the heavy losses of men and equipment sustained, there was little evidence of an end in sight for Moscow's campaign. 'Without concrete steps to build a new force, Russia can't fight a long war, and the clock starts ticking on the failure of their army in Ukraine,' said Phillips P O'Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews. Russia has about 97 battalion tactical groups (BTGs) in Ukraine, largely in the east and the south, a slight increase over last week, according to a senior US official. A further 19 BTGs are reported to be just across the Russian border near the city of Belgorod.", "07c595215e60d2d000a3e836842ce301701e1f612b68b0c44c0407d3": "Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged the international community to take immediate steps to end a Russian blockade of his country's ports in order to allow wheat shipments and prevent a global food crisis. After the Black Sea port of Odesa was struck by missiles on Monday, Zelenskiy said: 'For the first time in decades there is no usual movement of the merchant fleet, no usual port functioning in Odesa. Probably this has never happened in Odesa since world war two. 'Without our agricultural exports, dozens of countries in different parts of the world are already on the brink of food shortages. And over time, the situation can become downright terrible ... This is a direct consequence of Russian aggression, which can be overcome only together - by all Europeans, by the whole free world.' One person was killed and five injured when seven missiles hit a shopping centre and a depot in Odesa, Ukraine's armed forces said. Air raid sirens sounded as the missiles interrupted a meeting between Charles Michel, president of the European Council, and the Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, forcing them into a bomb shelter. Michel said he saw silos full of grain, wheat and corn unable to be exported. 'This badly needed food is stranded because of the Russian war and blockade of Black Sea ports, causing dramatic consequences for vulnerable countries,' he said. 'We need a global response.' There was no let-up in fighting elsewhere, with Russian strikes on targets in the east and south and a renewed push by Kremlin's forces to defeat the last Ukrainian troops holding out in a steelworks in ruined Mariupol. At least 100 civilians remained trapped in the plant, which remained under heavy Russian fire, an aide to the Mariupol mayor said on Tuesday. Full control of the city would allow Moscow to create a land bridge between the Crimean peninsula, which it annexed in 2014, and eastern regions run by pro-Russian separatists. Air raid sirens could be heard across several regions of Ukraine early on Tuesday, including in Luhansk, Kharkiv and Dnipro. The governor of Luhansk reported 'very serious battles' in the frontline areas of Bilogorivka and Rubizhne. In the town of Bogodukhov, north-west of Kharkiv, four people were killed and several homes were destroyed in Russian attacks on Monday, local media quoted Kharkiv officials as saying. In the US, congressional Democrats have reportedly agreed to provide as soon as Tuesday a further $39.8bn in additional aid for Ukraine, exceeding president Joe Biden's request last month for $33bn including more than $20bn in military assistance. Senate leaders were prepared to move quickly to enact the proposal, reports said, which includes an additional $3.4bn for military aid and $3.4bn in humanitarian aid. Biden said: 'This aid has been critical to Ukraine's success on the battlefield. We cannot allow our shipments of assistance to stop while we await further congressional action. A bill that Biden signed into law on Monday allows quicker supply of military equipment to Ukraine. Before signing the bill, the US president said 'Putin's war' was 'once more bringing wanton destruction of Europe', drawing reference to the significance of Victory Day. 'It really matters,' Biden said of the bipartisan support for Ukraine. One of the bill's chief Republican sponsors, Senator John Cornyn of Texas, said: 'I'm glad America could act as the arsenal of democracy for this critical partner.' On Monday, Vladimir Putin used Victory in Europe Day - the anniversary of Germany's unconditional surrender in 1945, and Russia's biggest patriotic holiday - to rally his people behind the invasion. The White House dismissed the Russian president's speech as 'revisionist history' and said his suggestion that western aggression led to the Ukraine war was 'patently absurd'. In another attempt to pile pressure on Russia, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said she had made 'progress' on a proposed Russian oil embargo during talks with the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, one of Putin's closest allies in Europe, who has held up EU attempts to phase out Russian oil. In other developments: With Reuters, AFP and Associated Press", "7aa535dad5d121748635f1aed341f79fbbd1391bd73dae4131326ef9": "France has said a deal on a proposed EU ban on Russian oil could be struck this week, despite opposition from the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, who has compared the plans to an atomic bomb. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, held a phone call with Orban in an effort to break the deadlock over the latest round of EU sanctions, the sixth since the eve of the invasion. There were 'contacts at all levels to ensure we have a global deal on this sixth package', a spokesperson at the Elysee Palace said after the call. Clement Beaune, a Macron ally and France's Europe minister, said he thought 'we could strike a deal this week'. Meanwhile, Ursula von der Leyen said there had been progress after making a last-minute dash to Budapest to discuss the plans with Orban on Monday night. The European Commission president described the discussion as 'helpful to clarify issues related to sanctions and energy security'. 'We made progress, but further work is needed,' she added, promising to hold a video conference with other countries in the region to boost cooperation on oil infrastructure. EU diplomats insist all 27 member states are united behind the idea of a ban on Russian oil, with sources close to the talks describing the delay as technical rather than political. However, the EU had hoped to announce the oil embargo and a new set of sanctions on influential Russians before last weekend, following Von der Leyen's presentation of the plans at the European parliament last Wednesday. About a quarter of the EU's oil comes from Russia, but some countries use far more. Slovakia and Hungary, landlocked countries that are nearly 100%-dependent on Russian oil, have been offered a delay in imposing the oil embargo until the end of 2024, to enable them to overhaul their refineries. The Czech Republic has been offered a delay until June 2024, while the full ban would come into force for the rest of the EU by the end of this year. Orban said last week that 'in its present form' the proposal was 'tantamount to dropping a nuclear bomb on the Hungarian economy'. The Hungarian foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, repeated the phrase before Monday's talks with Von der Leyen, according to Orban's international spokesperson, Zoltan Kovacs. Hungary says it needs five years and hundreds of billions of forints to convert its Szazhalombatta refinery near Budapest, which can only take Russian oil. Hungarian officials say they could get oil from Croatia, but this would require their southern neighbour to boost its capacity. A European Commission spokesperson said on Tuesday that Von der Leyen had been invited by Orban to discuss 'issues related to European energy security and supply' and had gone to Budapest 'to listen and to search for solutions jointly'. The discussion did not go into timelines on phasing out Russian oil in Hungary, the spokesperson said, but focused on oil transportation infrastructure. Orban has also threatened to block attempts to sanction Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox church, who has described the attack on Ukraine as a 'religious cleansing operation'. Speaking on Hungarian radio last week, Orban said the Orthodox community in Hungary had written to him protesting about the cleric's inclusion on a draft list that would mean a travel ban and asset freezes in the EU. Orban said he opposed imposing sanctions on church leaders 'because that would affect the religious freedom of communities in Hungary, which is sacrosanct'.", "035b0de1f47cc21e7171d79c941245933c79b5999cea6ed3d5c20acf": "When the first Russian bombs fell on Ukraine, Myroslava Marchenko was a gynaecologist at a private clinic in Kyiv. The next day, one of her patients was due to have an abortion after prenatal tests showed a high chance of Down's syndrome. Instead, like millions across the country, Marchenko and her patient fled to safety, crossing the border into Poland where abortions due to foetal abnormalities - or 'on eugenic grounds' in the language of the country's constitutional tribunal - are illegal. 'She called me and said, 'Oh, my God, I don't know what to do, because time is running out and my pregnancy is growing, but I don't want to raise this child because it's war, and I can't manage it,'' Marchenko recalls. It was, she says, the first time that she understood the impact that Poland's abortion laws, and the barriers that had been erected to prevent women accessing emergency contraception, could have on individual lives. Marchenko told her patient she should leave Poland and travel to the Czech Republic in order to access a safe termination. More than 2 million Ukrainians have found refuge in Poland since the beginning of the war in February; the vast majority are women with children. While the two countries share history, culture and a border, women's access to reproductive healthcare is radically different. In Ukraine, abortions are legally provided on request in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, oral contraception is sold over the counter without prescription and the morning-after pill is readily available. In Poland, abortion is almost completely outlawed and access to contraception is ranked as the worst in Europe, according to the European Parliamentary Forum. Many doctors refuse to prescribe emergency contraception or even IUDs (intrauterine devices) on ethical grounds, arguing that they are akin to an abortion. Oxana Lytvynenko, a Ukrainian reproductive rights activist who has lived in Poland for 16 years and has been helping refugees in reception points since the war began, says that some women have no idea that their access to reproductive healthcare services will vanish upon crossing the border. '[Ukrainian refugees crossing the border] are completely unprepared for the situation here, they don't know the law. Even if someone has read an article somewhere about abortion in Poland, [many] still think, 'OK, so they don't do abortion on demand, but if there is a good reason then they will do it,'' she says. 'It's difficult because you don't want to re-traumatise these women just after they are so happy to be safe again. It doesn't feel like the right moment to tell them the truth.' Lytvynenko says she has met women at the border who have asked her to help them access medication to terminate a pregnancy, but says that the ability to access reproductive healthcare services is down to chance. 'If women in need of abortion pills cross the border, it really depends who they are met by,' she says. 'If it is someone progressive, feminist, then they'll be able to put them in touch with right people. But if it is some random man, or someone religious, then no way. They'll either not care or they'll say it is God's angel and you need to keep it.' Members of Poland's anti-abortion movement have also been at the border to greet refugees. Within the first weeks of the war, volunteers from the Life and Family group started handing out leaflets at refugee reception points depicting dismembered foetuses and citing abortion as the biggest threat to peace. The leaflets also advised pregnant women to denounce to the police anyone offering them an abortion. While Marchenko waits to receive a Polish medical licence she has been working with Federa, a Polish women's rights organisation, to launch a Ukrainian-language hotline for women seeking help on where to access reproductive healthcare services. She says the hotline receives about 10 calls a day, 10% of which are queries on how to access an abortion. Some of the questions Marchenko receives come from women with planned pregnancies who no longer feel able to give birth living as a refugee. Others are from women who became pregnant after joining their husbands who were already working in Poland before the war. 'Even though there is a war, questions of reproduction are still there, especially as many women have not yet managed to secure contraception,' she says. Aborcyjny Dream Team, a group that aids women in sourcing abortion tablets from abroad, says 158 Ukrainians have turned to them for help since the beginning of the conflict. As evidence and reports of rape and sexual assault of Ukrainian citizens continue to emerge, activists and politicians in Poland are also becoming increasingly concerned about how rape victims seeking safety in Poland may be able to secure a legal abortion if needed. Between 2010 and 2020, fewer than five legal abortions a year were carried out in Poland on the grounds of rape, with women needing permission from a prosecutor. Leftwing politicians recently suggested amendments to a recent bill passing through the Polish government on the reception of Ukrainian refugees, which would force prosecutors to issue the necessary documentation within a seven-day period. The proposal was rejected by the Sejm, the lower chamber of the Polish parliament. 'My only hope is that none of the Ukrainian women who need an abortion try to get it legally in Poland,' said Lytvynenko. 'I hope they just keep driving westward to Germany. Because once they declare the pregnancy to the doctor, it'll be over for them.'

In response, online, anonymous volunteers - such as those under the Twitter account Great Translation Movement - have exposed China's pro-Russia propaganda by highlighting mistranslations that falsely blame Ukrainian troops for bombings and atrocities perpetrated by Russian forces against civilians. On 21 April, an article published by the Guardian revealed how civilians, who died during the Russian occupation of the Ukrainian city of Bucha, were killed by tiny metal arrows called flechettes, from shells of a type fired by Russian artillery. However, the South Review, an official state media and subsidiary of the Chinese Communist party, owned by the Guangzhou Daily newspaper group, mistranslated the article, claiming the flechette rounds were fired by Ukrainian forces. 'The UK Guardian published the first postmortem findings of the Bucha incidents: they were caused by Ukraine shelling Bucha,' reads the article from South Review. On Weibo, a military-focused account with more than 4.7 million followers added: 'Although the Guardian normally publishes anti-Russian comments, this time the forensic doctor's report turned out to be the exact opposite.' (When checked by the Guardian on 6 May, the author had since modified this Weibo entry). The apparently mistranslated article caused much controversy even on China's heavily monitored social media. Many English-speaking users of Weibo pointed out the mistake. On 27 April, China Fact Check, under the Shanghai-based the Paper news website, clarified and said it was 'mistranslation'. On other occasions, despite Chinese officials preaching a neutral stance on the conflict in Ukraine, pro-Russia social media accounts have manipulated the news coming from the Ukrainian front. For example, on 8 April, in Kramatorsk, in eastern Ukraine, two Russian ballistic missiles exploded over the railway station, dropping cluster munitions, killing 59 people and injuring hundreds of passengers. The same day, a popular military Weibo account with more than 34 million followers falsely claimed the attack was carried out by Ukrainian troops. Towards the end of the entry, the account added a hashtag that suggested US labs in Ukraine were working on eight severely infectious diseases. ''In China's EN-CN dictionary, Russia translates into Ukraine,' the Great Translation Movement, which has about 150,000 followers, said on Twitter. Born shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Great Translation Movement - a Twitter account and a related hashtag that identifies itself as 'fourth estate' and 'holds muck-rake in hand, wears crown from gutter' - has been a source for English-language speakers to understand how state-linked Chinese social media discuss the war in Ukraine. The decentralised anonymous group is operated by several hundred volunteers around the world. For security reasons, they say, they do not know geographical locations of fellow contributors. But they were glued together by the same mission: contradicting Beijing's propaganda and naming and shaming those in China who support Putin's military adventure in his neighbour. 'To put it simply, the context behind everything is the colossal gulf between the different types of messaging that the Chinese government shapes for the rest of the world, versus that of within China,' they said in a written statement. Debates about Russia's invasion do exist in China, but on social media, which is heavily monitored, views similar to those in the western media are often met with censorship. Anti-western commentators of the events toe a Kremlin line, blaming Nato and the US for what they call 'special military actions'. Last month, some Chinese pundits went so far as to question whether the killings in Bucha were a 'staged performance'. '[A]fter all, Zelenskiy is an actor doing what actors are trained to do,' said a military commentator on Phoenix TV. A month earlier, the same pundit said Russia's invasion was 'in self-defence' in the face of US pressure. But as the Great Translation Movement began its crusade against pro-Russian misinformation, Chinese state media also launched their own campaign to discredit it. The nationalist tabloid the Global Times, for example, has since March published a number of articles accusing it of being a part of the 'anti-China force'. It even compared the account to the anti-communist McCarthyist crusade in 1950s America. 'Such a despicable 'movement' has a large potential audience, mostly in the west,' wrote one piece on 31 March. 'Some of them are novelty-seeking and feel superior on a cultural level. In light of China's rapid rise and the west's decline, these people need an illusional superiority to feel better.'", "687cdf60f081e4020895740b28ee408c758ae714f476e28db1d70654": "Russian hackers are seeking to target western countries supporting Ukraine in its efforts to resist Moscow's invasion, the head of GCHQ has said. Jeremy Fleming, the director of the British spy agency, said in a speech on Tuesday morning that while fears of a fully fledged online war between Russia and Ukraine had perhaps failed to materialise, there remained 'plenty' of cyber activity as part of the conflict. As well as affecting Ukraine directly, there had been 'some spillover of activity affecting other countries', Fleming said, and evidence that Russian actors were trying to escalate the conflict further afield. 'We've seen indications that Russia's cyber operatives continue to look for targets in countries that oppose their actions,' the GCHQ chief said. 'That's why we have increased our efforts to ensure UK businesses and government urgently improve levels of cyber resilience.' Fleming did not provide extra evidence, but last month, Britain's National Cyber Security Agency, an arm of GCHQ, joined forces with its US counterpart, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, in producing an advisory notice warning against a potential Russian escalation. At the time they warned there was a risk some Russian criminal hackers 'have recently publicly pledged support for the Russian government' and that they could be willing to engage 'in retaliation for perceived cyber offensives against the Russian government or the Russian people'. Russia has been accused of staging more than 200 cyber-attacks on Ukraine since launching its invasion on 24 February, according to an analysis from Microsoft, targeting government agencies and media companies with hacking attempts or destructive malware designed to disable systems. Fleming said the UK, in conjunction with the US and other allies, was engaged in continuing 'to support Ukraine in shoring up their cyber defences' - a recognition that the country is the frontline of what could yet spread into an international cyber conflict. Last month, Ukraine said Russian hackers had tried to take out the country's power grid, and came close to cutting off power for about 2 million people using a variant of the Industroyer malware. Although these attacks were aimed at Ukraine, there remains the risk that such malware could spread uncontrolled. In 2017, Russian state actors launched the NotPetya malware against Ukrainian companies, but it spread indiscriminately around the world, affecting a string of western companies and even some Russian corporations. Western spy agencies have previously said that attack was also conducted by operatives from the GRU, or main intelligence directorate of the Russian army. Fleming also used his speech to highlight that the National Cyber Force (NCF), a new offensive hacker group, run jointly by GCHQ and the Ministry of Defence, was involved in tackling cybercrime. 'Through the NCF we are actively undermining the cybercriminals' assumption that they can act with impunity on the internet. We have disrupted criminals, making it clear that they are being observed, and going after their ability to profit from illegal activities,' he said. The NCF activities have included actions to prevent cybercriminals 'from profiting from their crimes' - though it was not spelled out how - and 'denying them access to their cyber tools and malware' which are used to carry out attacks. Later this month, Fleming added, Suella Braverman, the attorney general, would set out further details on how far the NCF can go in its efforts to maintain national security. She would 'set out the government's latest legal views on the responsible use of cyber capabilities', he said.", "0762c5860f633ccf4a0e2516178a55656e88474673b3c9af406bd5e9": "A recent rise in dolphin deaths in the Black Sea may have been caused by the war in Ukraine, scientists have said. Researchers believe heightened noise pollution in the northern Black Sea, caused by about 20 Russian navy vessels and ongoing military activities, may have been driving cetaceans south to Turkish and Bulgarian shores, where they are being stranded or caught in fishing nets in unusually high numbers. Since the beginning of the war, Turkey has recorded a rise in strandings of the common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) across its Black Sea coast. More than 80 of the animals were found dead across the country's western Black Sea, which the Turkish Marine Research Foundation (Tudav) described as 'an extraordinary increase'. Initial investigations by Tudav revealed that about half of these dolphins were killed after getting entangled in fishing nets. The fate of the other half, however, is still an 'unanswered question', according to Dr Bayram Ozturk, the chair of Tudav, as no signs of entanglement or gunshot wounds could be found on the carcasses. 'Acoustic trauma is one of the possibilities that come to mind,' Ozturk said, although he stressed it was important to remain cautious. 'We don't have proof on what low frequency sonar may cause in the Black Sea because we have never seen this many ships, and this much noise for such an extended time - and science always demands proof.' Navies commonly rely on sonar to detect enemy submarines from great distances. Because marine mammals also depend on sound for communication and other functions, the underwater noise can have serious, even fatal, effects on cetaceans. According to Dr Pavel Gol'din, a researcher at Ukraine's National Academy of Sciences, while acoustic trauma may explain the strandings, constant underwater noise caused by military activities could explain the higher bycatch rate. Permanent underwater noise may not kill the animals directly, but could still seriously disturb and harm them, he said, as dolphins and other species may head for unfamiliar territory to try to avoid it. 'It might be the cause of mass migration of fish and cetacean stocks to the south,' he said. Dimitar Popov, a project manager for Green Balkans, a Bulgarian conservation organisation, agrees with this theory. He has detected a similar trend in Bulgarian waters, mostly among Black Sea harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena relicta). Green Balkans has been monitoring the bycatch of cetaceans in turbot fishing for four years. Throughout this period, bycatch was lowest during spring months and peaked in summer. This spring, by contrast, Popov said, 50 cetaceans had become entangled in 72 kilometres of nets, a number close to the peak figure from summer 2019. Scientists say their investigations are hampered by the fact there are no protocols to protect marine mammals during the war. 'There are dozens of ships in the Black Sea but we don't even know how often they use sonar,' Ozturk said. The scientists say a lack of access to information is not only hindering research into cetacean deaths, but also making it hard to track which animals are most at risk. These are likely to include harbour porpoises, which should be migrating from the Black Sea towards the war-stricken Sea of Azov, as well as migratory birds that spend part of the year at the rich wetlands in the northern Black Sea.", "bc1a313cb57087fe78aadd6781f479db1d9f6664369eef1df55dfd30": "The Spanish government has sacked the country's spy chief, Paz Esteban, as it tries to contain the fallout from a cyber-espionage scandal that has engulfed the ruling coalition and raised further questions about the use of controversial Pegasus spyware in Spain and beyond. Esteban's dismissal on Tuesday came amid growing political tensions and almost two years after a joint investigation by the Guardian and El Pais first revealed that senior pro-independence Catalan politicians were warned their mobile phones had been targeted using the spyware. The scandal has intensified over recent weeks after cybersecurity experts at Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto said at least 63 people connected with the Catalan independence movement had been targeted or infected with Pegasus spyware between 2017 and 2020. It has also emerged that the mobile phones of the prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, the defence minister, Margarita Robles, and the interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, were subjected to 'illicit' and 'external' targeting using Pegasus last year. The Spanish government has not commented on which foreign country may have been responsible. Last week, Esteban reportedly confirmed to a congressional committee that 18 members of the Catalan independence movement - including the current Catalan regional president, Pere Aragones - were spied on with judicial approval by Spain's national intelligence centre (CNI). At a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, the government said Esteban - the first woman to head the CNI - had been relieved of her post and would be replaced by another female intelligence veteran, Esperanza Casteleiro. Robles, whose ministry oversees the CNI, admitted there had been 'shortcomings' but said the change represented a 'new step' for the centre and a chance for it to address 'things that could obviously be improved'. Among them, she added, was the fact that it appeared to have taken the centre a year to discover that the ministerial phones had been hacked. She attempted to brush off reporters' questions about whether Esteban had been fired over that particular intelligence failure. 'You talk about firing but I'd call it a replacement - with one civil servant from the centre replacing another civil servant from the centre,' said Robles. '[Casteleiro] knows the centre very well, has worked there for almost 40 years, and is working for Spain.' She added: 'Although I think there may be reasons for feeling proud and satisfied, we're going to keep on working to make sure that there are no cracks in the total, general sphere of security so that Spanish citizens feel safe.' Robles said the government and all its agencies acted in full accordance with the law - 'it's legality, legality, and more legality'. She also said she hoped the documents Esteban had shown the congressional committee would eventually be declassified so that people could see the CNI had followed the law and acted with judicial authorisation. Aragones's pro-independence Catalan Republican Left party - a key parliamentary ally for Sanchez's minority government - had demanded Madrid take measures to restore confidence in light of the allegations in the Citizen Lab report. Aragones said the spying scandal was 'dynamiting' attempts to find a negotiated solution to the Catalan independence crisis. However, the government's decision to sack Esteban was immediately denounced by its opponents. Alberto Nunez Feijoo, the new leader of Spain's conservative People's party, accused the prime minister of selling out his intelligence chief to appease the Catalan president and his supporters. 'It's grotesque to see Sanchez offering the independence movement the head of the director of the CNI - he's once again weakening the state to try to ensure his survival,' Nunez Feijoo tweeted. 'It's a real slap in the face for our country. Unjustifiable.' But Gabriel Rufian, the spokesperson for the Catalan Republican Left party, said the Spanish government had merely done what needed to be done. 'The mobile phones of three of the most protected and important people in this country - the prime minister, the defence minister and the interior minister - were spied on,' he said. 'Accepting political responsibilities isn't a concession to the independence movement, it's a concession to common sense.' The issue has caused further divisions between the Socialist party and its junior partners in the Unidas Podemos alliance, who had called for the resignation of Robles. The Podemos leader, Ione Belarra, said taking responsibility was 'a basic question of democratic health.' She added: 'To regain people's trust there also need to be guarantees that this won't happen again.' The alleged spying and the government's handling of it have also been criticised by Amnesty International. 'The Spanish government can't use the security of the Spanish state as an excuse to cover up possible human rights violations,' Esteban Beltran, the head of Amnesty Spain, said last week. He said the official secrets committee 'is characterised by secrecy and obscurantism [and] cannot be the right place to investigate possible human rights violations'. Sanchez's Spanish Socialist Workers' party (PSOE) last week joined the three parties on the Spanish right in vetoing a parliamentary inquiry into the Pegasus scandal. A PSOE spokesperson said the mooted congressional committee was not needed because an internal investigation by the CNI was already under way, as was an inquiry by the public ombudsman. It remains unclear whether or not the software alleged to have been used by the CNI against the Catalan targets was Pegasus, which, according to its manufacturers, is sold only to governments to track criminals and terrorists.", "db8d69b89c77de2f931c27896a0644598253b49385429ea01bb394a4": "Starmer says Britain can do more than just 'get Brexit done'. But the country needs more than what this government is offering. He says the Queen's speech was 'thin' and 'bereft of ideas or purpose, without a guiding principle, or a roadmap for delivery'. He says he would like to think the worst is over. But the country is 'staring down the barrel of something we haven't seen in decades - a stagflation crisis [rising inflation and rising unemployment].' The government should be introducing a windfall tax, he says. UPDATE: Starmer said: Sefcovic said the EU was open to negotiating with the UK on how the protocol was implemented, but, for these talks to succeed, that would require 'the UK government to show the same level of determination and creativity [as the EU]'. He also said that if the UK were to take 'unilateral action' - ie, to abandon parts of the protocol - this would make the situation more difficult. He said: Earlier Johnson refused to give his Irish counterpart, Micheal Martin, an assurance that the UK will not unilaterally abandon the protocol. (See 11.20am.) In fact, the Queen's speech contained a strong hint that legislation that would allow the protocol to be ditched is being prepared behind the scenes. (See 12.11am.) In the Commons a few minutes ago Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, said he intended to stay as an MP, instead of leaving parliament to take up his seat in the Northern Ireland assembly (he was elected last week), until the protocol issue is resolved. Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, has joined Theresa May, the Conservative former prime minister (see 4.36pm), in welcoming the inclusion of the renters reform bill in the Queen's speech. It will abolish so-called 'no fault' section 21 evictions. Khan's office said: Shelter welcomed this bill and the social housing regulation bill, which will increase the powers of the regulator of social housing. Polly Neate, the charity's chief executive, said:  These are from Jayne Ozanne, founder of the Ban Conversion Therapy coalition, on the watered-down plans for a bill banning conversion practices in the Queen's speech. (See 2.06pm.) Green campaigners were dismayed at the lack of action on insulation in the Queen's speech, which they said was a way to bring down energy bills quickly for hard-hit households, and by the abandonment of animal welfare measures. Juliet Phillips, of the E3G thinktank, praised the government's move to a new 'market mechanism' that would encourage the take-up of heat pumps. She said: This could bring new green jobs to the UK, she added. But Greenpeace's head of politics, Rebecca Newsom, was more scathing, accusing the government of giving up on the cost of living crisis. She said: Katie White, executive director of advocacy and campaigns at WWF, said:    This is from Pat McFadden, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, on the Treasury briefing saying there are no plans for an imminent announcement about helping people with the cost of living, as Boris Johnson implied. (See 4.05pm.) McFadden said: Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, is speaking in the debate now. He says the Lib Dems want an emergency cut in VAT. On Northern Ireland, May says there was no reference in the Queen's speech to a Northern Ireland protocol bill. She says a bill of the kind the government is said to be considering, giving it the power to ditch parts of the protocol (see 12.11pm), would not be a good idea. She goes on: Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, says the Northern Ireland protocol has to be dealt with. May says she put forward a Brexit plan that would have avoided new checks at the Northern Ireland/Great Britain border. But the DUP opposed that plan, she says. She also says she is disappointed there is no employment bill in the Queen's speech. That would have allowed the government to legislate to allow waiters and waitresses to keep their tips. And she says she is disappointed the government is not legislating to set up an independent public advocate - something the Tories promised in their 2017 manifesto. After backbench speeches from Sir Peter Bottomley and Meg Hillier, Theresa May the former prime minister is speaking now. She says she is glad the government now seems to be addressing the problem of no-fault evictions. She says her government wanted to address this. But she says she is concerned by reports that Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, favours letting people in a street vote to decide whether a housing application in their street should be allowed. She says she can see that plan backfiring. Lewis Goodall from Newsnight says the claim from Boris Johnson that his Rwanda asylum plan is just a rehash of a New Labour proposal (see 3.39pm) is highly misleading. This is from my colleague Heather Stewart, confirming that when Boris Johnson said in his speech that the government would be saying more about helping people with the cost of living in the days to come (see 3.32pm), he almost certainly meant months not days.", "94800c9bb591573761972e948076e809dc1a937efce813f9889b48fb": "Liz Truss is reportedly preparing draft legislation that would unilaterally scrap key parts of the Northern Ireland protocol, removing the need for checks on goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. No bill was announced in the Queen's speech on Tuesday but the foreign secretary is reported to have asked officials to prepare the draft, which would put the UK in breach of its treaty obligations. As well as scrapping checks, the draft legislation would also take away powers of the European court of justice and remove all requirement for Northern Irish businesses to follow EU regulations. A government source confirmed Truss intended to move unilaterally to prepare to change parts of the protocol but denied the UK government had given up on negotiation. Truss is understood to have formed the view that the UK cannot wait for negotiations to conclude before preparing to act unilaterally, given the election results in Northern Ireland over the weekend. Senior UK sources emphasised that stability in Northern Ireland was at stake with the glacial pace of talks and while the EU has made clear that its mandate is not set to change. Some cabinet ministers, including the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, were said to be uneasy about the high stakes involved in Truss's strategy and the possibility of a trade war with the EU as the UK stands on the brink of a potential recession. Cabinet sources suggested Truss's manoeuvres were part of 'leadership feather-fluttering' - hinting they were designed to put her at odds with Sunak in the minds of Conservative backbenchers. Sources close to Gove and Sunak denied they were trying to block Truss's plans. The draft bill was initially understood to be intended to grant ministers the power in principle to override the treaty - but not necessarily to be used in practice. However, the Times reported on Tuesday that the bill would go further than expected and scrap parts of the protocol. Such a move is expected to provoke legal retaliation by the EU were it to go ahead - including the bloc potentially imposing new tariffs. Truss will argue that the election results in Northern Ireland give the negotiations a fresh sense of urgency because the Democratic Unionist party has said it will boycott any participation in a new government at Stormont until the issue is resolved. Sinn Fein, which won the most seats at Stormont for the first time, said Northern Ireland was becoming 'collateral damage' in the dispute. Boris Johnson spoke to Ireland's taoiseach, Micheal Martin, on Tuesday morning. No 10 said he underlined the grave situation in Northern Ireland and reiterated warnings about the protocol. 'Despite repeated efforts by the UK government over many months to fix the protocol, including those sections related to the movement of goods and governance, the European Commission had not taken the steps necessary to help address the economic and political disruption on the ground,' No 10 said of the call. 'The prime minister reiterated that the UK government would take action to protect peace and political stability in Northern Ireland if solutions could not be found.' A UK government spokesperson said: 'Our focus has been, and will continue to be, preserving peace and stability in Northern Ireland. No decisions have yet been taken on the way forward. However, the situation is now very serious. 'We have always been clear that action will be taken to protect the Belfast [Good Friday] agreement if solutions cannot be found to fix the protocol.' The Irish deputy prime minister, Leo Varadkar, who reached agreement with Johnson on the protocol in October 2019, suggested the UK was using threats to gain leverage in negotiations. However, he warned the UK could not simply 'resile' from the international treaty by unilaterally tearing up the protocol. 'If that is their approach, then we have a real problem here,' he told RTE. 'It's one thing to engage in a bit of sabre rattling ... but if they were to actually go down that route, it will be very serious.'  Labour's Jenny Chapman, a shadow minister, said the action 'risks a trade war during a cost of living crisis'.", "083a55bd1a07cb6f5cd6a0139fa660cfe192f611b0541f68d8f88ef7": "Beijing has accused Washington of 'political manipulation' and attempting to change the status quo after the US state department quietly amended its website to remove a line stating it did not support Taiwanese independence. In a delicate geopolitical balancing act, the US has long acknowledged, but not supported, China's claim to Taiwan under its version of the 'one China principle'. However, experts say that policy has been eroded as Beijing has become more assertive. In testimony to the Senate on Tuesday, the US director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, said China was seeking the military capability to be able to conquer Taiwan, even if the US intervened. 'It's our view that they are working hard to effectively put themselves into a position in which their military is capable of taking Taiwan over our intervention,' Haines told the Senate armed services committee. She said she would only talk in closed session about how long the US estimated that would take. Haines added that US intelligence estimated Beijing 'would prefer not to have to use military force to take Taiwan. They prefer to use other means.' In an updated page on the state department's online 'fact sheet' Washington last week removed some key lines from the 1979 US-PRC joint communique. It included a line saying 'the US recognised the government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China, acknowledging the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is a part of China'. The line saying the US 'does not support Taiwan independence' - which appeared in a previous version published on 31 August 2018 - has also been removed from the website. The new version said the US 'continues to encourage the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait differences consistent with the wishes and best interests of the people of Taiwan'. It added: 'The United States has a longstanding one-China policy, which is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three US-China joint communiques, and the six assurances.' Beijing sees Taiwan as a part of China and has vowed to take it back, with force if necessary. On Tuesday, a spokesperson at the American Institute in Taiwan - the US's de facto embassy on the island - said Washington's commitment to Taipei was 'rock solid', and that it 'contributes to the maintenance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and within the region'. On the same day, Beijing criticised the change. A foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, called the edit 'an act of political manipulation and an attempt to change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait, which will backfire and the US itself will get burned'. The edits took place on 5 May, the state department's website showed. The latest fact sheet on Taiwan begins with the line that 'as a leading democracy and a technological powerhouse, Taiwan is a key US partner in the Indo-Pacific'. The state department also said that the US and Taiwan 'share similar values, deep commercial and economic links, and strong people-to-people ties'. It is not immediately clear if recent changes to the fact sheet reflected the Biden administration's latest policy on China. Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, was scheduled to deliver a major speech last week laying out the government's framing on China. The activity was cancelled because of Blinken's Covid test results. Tensions between Washington and Beijing over the island of Taiwan have continued to increase since Biden became US president last year. In January, Qin Gang, the Chinese envoy to the US, said the two countries could face a 'military conflict' over the future of Taiwan, in an unusually explicit reference to the prospect of war.", "68582f3de66a2d72433076496a60c5e4f76e1f7d58f4807948314137": "The Home Office has admitted that lesbian, gay and bisexual refugees could be persecuted if sent to Rwanda - but still plans to fly them 4,000 miles to Kigali. The department's equality impact assessment for the policy states there are 'concerns' over the treatment of some LGBTQI+ people in the east African country, and that investigations point to 'ill treatment' of this group being 'more than one off'. It comes the day after the Home Office said the first group of people would be informed this week of the government's intention to relocate them to Rwanda. The first flights were expected to take place in the coming months, it said, adding that lawyers for some of those affected were likely to launch proceedings to stop their removal. In the report released on Monday, the assessment says 'there are concerns over the treatment of some LGBTQI+ people but we will continue to consider the impact on this group and take into account further evidence over the course of the partnership'. The report notes that homosexuality was decriminalised in 2010, but warns: 'At this stage, investigations point to ill treatment being more than one off, but it does not appear to be systemic.' The government's assessment of Rwanda's human rights record, states that there are 'not substantial grounds' for believing they would be at risk of treatment contrary to article 3 (freedom from torture and inhuman or degrading treatment) of the European convention of human rights in Rwanda. At the same time, the Foreign Office travel advice for Rwanda states that 'individuals can experience discrimination and abuse, including from local authorities. There are no specific anti-discrimination laws that protect LGBT individuals.' Lewis Mudge, central Africa director at Human Rights Watch, said the risk assessment was an unrealistic assessment of a country with a poor human rights record. 'The Home Office's report reads like some serious wishful thinking and they seem to change the facts in order to justify a preordained conclusion. From claiming that refugees are not targeted for exercising their freedom of expression - when Congolese refugees rot in jail for protesting their living conditions - to claiming that LGBT people won't risk serious harm in Rwanda - when evidence we've collected has LGBTI people detained, beaten, insulted and harassed for their sexual identity.' 'This report is not grounded in reality. The Rwandan government has an abysmal record when it comes to guaranteeing internationally recognised refugee rights, statues and protocols. It's difficult to imagine a less genuine assessment of Rwanda's shocking human rights record,' he said. In another document released on Monday night, the government said it could send notices of intent to those coming to the UK without authorisation that would warn them they could be sent to Rwanda. A draft letter said: 'I am writing to inform you about how your protection claim is being managed. We have evidence that before you claimed asylum in the United Kingdom, you were present in or had a connection to [name the safe country or countries]. This may have consequences for whether your claim is admitted to the UK asylum system. 'We may also ask Rwanda, another country we consider to be safe, whether it would admit you, under the terms of the migration and economic development partnership between Rwanda and the UK.' Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said letters carrying a threat of Rwanda would prompt many of those waiting for their claims to be processed to disappear and hide from the authorities in the UK. 'The government is failing in its duty of care to people in the asylum system by not recognising the devastating impact the threat of being expelled to Rwanda is having on them. 'The process it is putting in place lacks compassion and demonstrates an inability to see the face behind the case. It shows how this government simply wants to treat vulnerable people who have fled war and oppression as human cargo to be transported thousands of miles away out of sight and out of mind,' he said. A Home Office spokesperson said: 'There is no evidence to substantiate these baseless claims. 'Illegal migrants, including those who crossed the Channel, may be removed and we have the power to detain people ahead of their removal from the UK. 'Only those with inadmissible asylum claims who have made dangerous, unnecessary and illegal journeys will be relocated and to suggest otherwise is wrong.'", "907c25a28a8234d5aed2ff5d182f8d34a1c525aab98a90fd18521b2f": "US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has built a vast digital surveillance system that gives it access to the personal details of almost every person in America, a two-year investigation by Georgetown University law center has found. Researchers from the Center on Privacy & Technology on Tuesday released one of the most comprehensive reviews of Ice activities, concluding that the federal organisation has strayed well beyond its duties as an immigration body to become what is in effect a domestic surveillance agency. Operating largely in secret and with minimal public oversight, Ice has amassed a formidable armory of digital capabilities that allows its agents to 'pull detailed dossiers on nearly anyone, seemingly at any time'. The vast mountain of data to which Ice now has access includes: The Georgetown researchers base their report, American Dragnet: Data-Driven Deportation in the 21st Century, on hundreds of freedom of information requests and a review of more than 100,000 previously unseen Ice spending transactions. The documents reveal the extent to which the agency's surveillance has expanded beyond sharing information with law enforcement agencies to exploiting an array of public and private databases. The agency operates an enormous dragnet of information stored by state and local government, utility companies, social media platforms and private data brokers. The end result is that Ice enjoys almost universal reach, with its intelligence weaponised through the use of powerful algorithmic tools for searching and analysing data. Almost all of that activity, the report points out, is done in the absence of warrants and in secret, beyond the purview of federal and state authorities. The scale of Ice surveillance shocked even the report's authors. 'I was alarmed to discover just how easily federal immigration agents can pull detailed records from the most intimate corners of all our lives,' Nina Wang, a policy associate at the Center on Privacy & Technology and a report author, told the Guardian. She added: 'In its attempts to target an ever-growing number of people for detention and deportation, Ice has reached into the private homes and lives of almost every person in America.' Wang said the immigration agency now had an unfettered ability to 'trace the movement of your vehicle on the roads, look up your address from your water or electricity bills, and conduct face recognition searches on your ID photos, all without needing a search warrant. 'These tactics open massive side doors around existing privacy protections, and many lawmakers still have no idea.' Ice was created in 2003, in the febrile post-9/11 era. Initially it focused on mining the intelligence-gathering potential of the criminal justice system, operating a scheme known as S-Comm in which digital fingerprint data was shared with it by federal, state and local law enforcement. Since then, Ice has increasingly resorted to databases compiled by non-law enforcement entities as a way of widening its dragnet. The Georgetown researchers suggest the motivation was partly to increase the number of deportations of undocumented people and partly as part of the US government's 'larger push to amass as much information as possible about all of our lives'. The center's review of Ice spending from 2008 to last year revealed that overall investment in new surveillance infrastructure increased fivefold from about $71m to $388m. In that period, Ice spent more than $1.3bn on geolocation technology, including contracts with private companies that own license plate scanning databases. A further $96m was spent on biometrics, largely face recognition databases; $97m on private data brokers that gather data on individuals from a range of different sources including more than 80 utility companies; and a staggering $569m on data analysis just to be able to comb through the mammoth quantities of intelligence Ice now had within its grasp. Approximately $189m was paid to Palantir Technologies, the tech company co-founded and chaired by the Trump-supporting billionaire Peter Thiel. The money went towards custom-built programs created by Palantir to allow Ice agents to link public and private databases so that they could, in the center's words, 'visualise an interconnected web of data pulled from nearly every part of an individual's life'. The researchers found a woefully inadequate response from federal and state authorities in terms of privacy protection. Congress, for instance, has yet to hold a full oversight hearing on Ice surveillance. One of the most disturbing aspects of the Ice surveillance system is how it has been used to skirt controls introduced by cities and states and designed to protect communities from precisely these kind of intrusive searches. After many legislatures introduced so-called 'sanctuary' policies that prevented police forces working with Ice agents to facilitate deportations, Ice simply sidestepped the restrictions by finding other channels through which it could acquire intelligence, including through DMVs, private data brokers and utility companies.", "184a9a314f63763671bcfe8eea14db26afa67de8b45ef8c69dcce434": "For decades, South Korea's presidents have begun their terms in office by acquainting themselves with the vast premises of the Blue House. But on Tuesday, Yoon Suk-yeol became the first leader in the country's modern history to shun the presidential residence, heading instead to a new office inside a former defence ministry building in central Seoul. Yoon, who has styled himself as the 'people's president', caused consternation when he said he had no intention of following his predecessors into the Blue House, so named because of the colour of its roof. He said the building, located at the foot of a mountain on a site once used by the Japanese during their 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean peninsula, was a 'symbol of imperial power' that would be opened to the public as a sign of his commitment to a more open and democratic presidency. Successive South Korean presidents have lived and worked there since the country became a republic in 1948. The gesture has not been well received, however. His predecessor, Moon Jae-in, criticised the move as hasty and a potential security threat, while even some of his conservative supporters questioned the decision - estimated to have cost $40m - at a time when Yoon should be focusing on the economy and North Korea. Yoon, 61, has been forced to deny that he and his wife had decided to live elsewhere on the advice of shamanistic healers, whose shady role in South Korean politics became an issue during the election campaign. Yoon said the theory had been cooked up by his political opponents to discredit him. 'The Democratic party seems to be more interested in shamans than I am,' he told reporters after his election victory on 9 March, adding that he had considered several locations for his new office and residence. He had come under scrutiny over claims that spiritual advisers introduced by his wife, Kim Kun-hee, had exerted influenced over his campaign. Kim, 49, had told a YouTube channel that she was a 'spiritual person' who preferred meaningful discussions with gurus to visiting nightclubs, according to the Yonhap news agency. Yoon also denied that he had frequented an anal acupuncturist. There was speculation that Yoon was determined to avoid the Blue House 'curse' that had befallen several of his predecessors, including the dictator Park Chung-hee, who was assassinated in the building's grounds in 1979, and his daughter, Park Geun-hye, who was impeached and imprisoned for corruption in 2017. As Yoon was being sworn in on Tuesday, members of the public who had drawn lots to visit the Blue House were divided over his decision. 'It feels surreal,' Hwang Jin-woo, who works for a construction company, told the Guardian outside the building, whose grounds will be turned into a public park. 'Since I was young, this place has been a symbol of power. Until yesterday, it was a symbol of power, but now the public can access it. I was born a few decades ago, at a time when I couldn't even take a glimpse at this place. But suddenly it's been given to the citizens, so it's a little overwhelming.' Lee Jin-ok, who was visiting from Suwon, near Seoul, agreed. 'I think it's really great that it has returned to the arms of the people,' she said. 'It has a lot of cultural value and I have always thought that the Blue House is one of the most beautiful buildings in Korea. I hope people will come here and enjoy themselves while learning about the history of Korea and its past presidents.' But Kim Moon-soo, an office worker, said he was not sure if the millions of dollars used to set up Yoon's new office had been money well spent. 'I think it was a bit of an act to show that he is keeping his promise from day one,' Kim said. 'At the same time, I hope he keeps his other promises and takes good care of the country during these challenging times.'", "ef1d0d745c03bedebf08abee2f95688ff09c47b22fbb470ba7318b42": "Coleen Rooney has accused Rebekah Vardy of conducting a 'deliberate and calculated' campaign to destroy evidence prior to their 'Wagatha Christie' libel trial, which got under way at the high court. Rooney's lawyers claimed potentially important WhatsApp messages involving Vardy had been manually deleted, pointed to an unfortunate incident in which Vardy's agent accidentally dropped her mobile phone off the side of a boat in the North Sea, and discussed how Vardy's own IT expert lost the password to a backup of her WhatsApp account. In written submissions, Rooney's lawyers said these were not a series of 'unfortunate' incidents. Instead, they claimed the loss of data was part of a 'deliberate and calculated' campaign by Vardy and her team to dispose of potentially incriminating evidence - and prevent a fair trial. Vardy's lawyers said the allegation was untrue: 'There is no such campaign of deletion. The reason there is no direct evidence against Mrs Vardy is because she didn't do it.' The two women listened to proceedings while sitting close to each other on the front bench of the wood-panelled Victorian courtroom in central London. Both are expected to give evidence in the coming days, along with other individuals including the former England footballer Wayne Rooney, following almost three years of pre-trial legal arguments. In 2019 Rooney conducted an elaborate sting operation to find out who was leaking stories from her private Instagram account to journalists at the Sun, ultimately making the public accusation that: 'It's............ Rebekah Vardy's account.' Vardy is now suing Rooney for libel, arguing this accusation is false. Following an earlier ruling, it is up to Rooney to prove Vardy was personally responsible for leaking stories to the Sun - or convince the judge that publication of the allegation was in the public interest. In written submissions, Vardy's barrister, Hugh Tomlinson QC, denied his client had personally leaked any stories to the Sun, nor had she approved or condoned 'anyone else to do so on her behalf'. However, in a late change of approach, he suggested it was 'possible' Vardy's agent, Caroline Watt, may have acted unilaterally and passed stories to the Sun without Vardy's knowledge. The court heard Watt is no longer healthy enough to give evidence. Tomlinson insisted that, rather than being the victim of Rooney's sting operation, Vardy was acutely aware that Rooney was posting fake stories in order to see whether anyone would leak them: 'She ... believed that someone was leaking information from Mrs Rooney's private Instagram but didn't know who it was and thought it must be her PR as she couldn't see why anyone would be 'arsed with selling stories on her'.' He said the 'candid' WhatsApp messages previously heard in court between Vardy and Watt showed that 'from time to time they did discuss 'leaking' information to the press'. But only one story - a drink-driving incident involving the Chelsea footballer Danny Drinkwater - was mentioned. Rooney simply 'can't establish that Mrs Vardy was responsible' for the leaks, he said. The lawyer said Vardy had suffered immensely as a result of Rooney's allegation and been 'subjected to abuse and threats of a horrific nature'. He said the term Wagatha Christie had passed into popular culture, with the media covering the court case as an entertainment story when in reality it was 'distressing and disturbing'. In an apparent reference to internet memes, Vardy's lawyer described the spread of 'little photographs that people have done mocking [Rooney] up as Wagatha Christie'. He also gently mocked Rooney's 'belief that what she reads in the Sun is accurate', with regards to an anonymous gossip column about life as a footballer's wife. Rooney's lawyers said an expert technology witness believed the loss of certain WhatsApp messages 'could only have occurred by manual deletion by an individual'. The legal team said this left the 'whiff of cordite' in the air - an apparent reference to a smoking gun. They also highlighted the trouble that Vardy's own IT expert had accessing a backup of her WhatsApp messages. At first the technology adviser said the password he had set no longer worked. Following advice from Rooney's team, the IT expert realised he was in fact able to access the files without a password, but the backup files had apparently become corrupted. Other issues with data recovery raised by Rooney's lawyers included deletion of a Twitter account belonging to Watt, the disposal of a laptop used by Vardy during the crucial period, and the hacking of her husband Jamie Vardy's WhatsApp account, which resulted in the loss of his messages. The case continues.", "8e15e976df59c9152d45af542aa042a692d97fdae25450a56e7011d1": "", "53a41c14743b0d926a8748069d91b85c74edfba2a01eba10fba90e4c": "In a dank, disused railway tunnel in West Sussex hangs a brown, furry parcel, the sole known representative of Britain's rarest mammal. Scientists don't like to apply emotive adjectives to animals, but if ever there were a lonesome creature, it would be this greater mouse-eared bat. The bat's reappearance in December for its 20th winter has astounded its guardians, because of the animal's great age, but also because it was missing, assumed dead, for nearly two years. Since 2002, the bat - the size of a small rabbit, with a wingspan stretching in flight to nearly half a metre - has spent winters clinging to the cool bricks of the tunnel. But it vanished in December 2019 and was missing when members of Sussex Bat Group returned in January and February 2020. Last year, the pandemic prevented a count, so its fate was unknown. 'We assumed it had run its course,' says Tony Hutson, a bat expert and retired entomologist from the Natural History Museum, who discovered the bat. 'But it returned and looked pretty healthy this winter.' Where Britain's rarest mammal spent the pandemic is just one question among many it poses. Each spring, the bat stirs, flaps slowly down the tunnel and vanishes into green woodlands beyond. It remains unseen until the following winter, when it returns to its hibernation roost. Where did it come from? Why is it here? Why is it alone? And can it be helped? When it was declared extinct in 1992, the greater mouse-eared bat, Myotis myotis, was the first land mammal to disappear from Britain since the wolf, about 250 years ago. Most bats zigzag through the sky collecting insects, but this species descends earthwards, swooping upon grasshoppers, crickets and dung beetles. Often, it will flop on to the ground, wings outstretched to fold over its prey. There were never many of these bats in Britain. When a colony was discovered in 1957 in the Isle of Purbeck, a peninsula in Dorset, it caused a sensation. Photos were published in the Times and several animals were prodded out of hibernation to be filmed in TV studios. Disturbing the bats mid-hibernation probably killed some of them. Others were spirited away by collectors. The species was barely seen again. Hutson is not the original champion of Britain's greater mouse-eared bats. The first was a tea planter from Sri Lanka (then known as Ceylon) called William Watt Addison Phillips, who retired to Bognor Regis in West Sussex in 1959, shortly after the frenzy in Dorset. While exploring dilapidated tunnels with his grandson, Phillips discovered a small colony of the bats. He proceeded to shoot a couple for donation to the Natural History Museum. When Hutson discovered the bat in 2002, he hoped this young male would lead them to a secret colony. But a media appeal brought no sightings. He scoured chalk mines and disused lime kilns. An attempt to extract DNA from bat hair, to identify the individual's origins, failed. He considered putting a VHF radio tag on the animal, but feared the imposition could kill it. In 2007, the bat was taken carefully from the wall for a short inspection. It was in good health, but very much alone: its genitals showed it had never been sexually active. In March 2018, I accompanied Hutson into the tunnel to meet Britain's loneliest bat. It is difficult to bond with anyone who is deeply asleep, head tucked out of sight, but it was a small, tranquil being (and a paler brown than I had imagined). When the Irish playwright Barry McStay read the Guardian article I wrote about the bat, it inspired him to write Vespertilio, a play about Alan, a devoted conservationist guarding a rare bat. The middle-aged bat lover meets a young homeless runaway and the unfolding fiction explores loneliness within the gay community, love, deceit and redemption. The critically acclaimed play opened in London in 2019 in the apposite surroundings of a disused railway tunnel beneath Waterloo station. Later that year, the bat disappeared. Now that it has reappeared, there are calls to solve the riddle of its existence. 'When it first turned up, I thought it was a pioneer and there were others around, but now I think it's just a stray that got over here from the continent somehow and hung on,' says Hutson. The Sussex Bat Group volunteers have done all they can, but Fiona Mathews, a professor of environmental biology at the University of Sussex, suggests professional conservationists should take action. She is calling on Natural England, the UK government's adviser for the protection of nature, to investigate whether more greater mouse-eared bats are living undetected in Britain. Genetic identification of bat droppings found in large roof spaces where the species could roost could reveal individuals secreted away - in the roof of a stately home, for instance. 'This individual bat is getting quite geriatric now. It's a fascinating thing, but I keep turning over in my head what could be done. Why aren't we doing more about this?' says Matthews. In mainland Europe, the species thrives around vineyards, which provide bare ground where it can easily find prey. Perhaps the proliferation of wine-making in Sussex could boost this impossibly uncommon bat in Britain. 'Given that we think Britain is going to become more suitable for the species with climate change, why don't we have a recovery programme for the greater mouse-eared bat?' asks Matthews. 'We know this species is losing its range in southern Europe. They will probably need to move north for their survival. They are in northern France, which is not that different and not that far away. Maybe they just need a helping hand across the Channel.' Wild Green Wonders: A Life in Nature by Patrick Barkham is out now (Guardian Faber, PS14.99).

Natural gas has long been touted as a 'transition' fuel for economies dependent on coal for their power needs, as it has lower carbon dioxide emissions than coal but requires similar centralised infrastructure, and gas-fired power stations take only a couple of years to build. Earlier this year, before Russia invaded Ukraine, the European Commission angered green campaigners by including gas as a 'bridge' to clean energy in its guidebook for green investment. High prices for gas, and the plummeting cost of renewable energies such as wind and solar power, have reversed that logic, according to analysis from TransitionZero. The cost of switching from coal to renewable energy has plunged by 99% since 2010, according to its report published on Tuesday. The findings call into question the economic viability of the scores of gas and coal-fired power plants that are planned or under construction around the world. About 615GW of new gas plants, and 442GW of new coal-fired power stations, are planned for construction globally, according to the analysis. Matt Gray, the co-founder of TransitionZero, said it no longer made sense to think of gas as a transition fuel, and countries should opt for renewables in place of coal. 'Despite some regional variation, our analysis shows a clear deflationary trend in the cost of switching from coal to clean electricity,' he said. 'Independent of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, this trend will accelerate, presenting governments with an economic opportunity to protect electricity consumers from continued fossil fuel volatility.' Many countries are reviewing their energy policies in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine - which has sent fossil fuel prices soaring and disrupted supplies - and may be considering a reversion to coal. The amount of power generated from coal rose 9% to a record high last year, even before the war in Ukraine, and if the coal-fired power stations now planned are built the world will have little chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C, according to separate analysis published last month. Gray said that although the economics were firmly in favour of renewable energy, governments must make some policy changes in order to realise the full benefits. These included making it easier to build windfarms and solar power, because acquiring planning permission can take up to 10 years in some regions; removing distorting incentives and tax breaks for fossil fuels; and ensuring electricity markets are properly functioning. The analysis also found that the economics of moving from coal power to renewable energy, without using gas, were most favourable in Europe, where the price of coal has increased, in part because of EU policies and also because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In China and the US, however, domestically produced coal is cheaper than in Europe. Despite the lower price of renewables, China is still planning new coal-fired power stations, and the US could increase its coal use in response to higher demand for gas. In Japan, the price of switching from coal to renewables is higher still, because of 'discriminatory regulations and land-use constraints', and in south-east Asia some countries subsidise coal and gas, distorting the economics of a switch to clean power.", "6c1240ea59d4e541ca32c22d429a967319c0954261702e0f403e9a16": "Doctors have stressed the importance of Covid vaccinations for pregnant women after a major review found the shots were not only safe, but reduced the risk of stillbirth by 15%. Researchers at St George's, University of London, and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists analysed 23 published studies and trials that enrolled 117,552 pregnant women vaccinated against Covid, to assess the safety of the shots. The vast majority of the women received the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, which provided 89.5% protection against Covid infection seven days after the second dose. There was no evidence of greater risk from miscarriage, preterm birth or other pregnancy complications. 'We wanted to see if vaccination was safe or not for pregnant women,' said Asma Khalil, professor of obstetrics and maternal fetal medicine at St George's hospital in London. 'It is safe, but what's surprising, and it's a positive finding, is that there was a reduction in stillbirths.' 'So far, most of the data on vaccines in pregnancy have been about protecting the pregnant woman herself from Covid. Now we have evidence that the vaccines protect the baby too,' she added. The results are published in Nature Communications. Almost all pregnant women admitted to UK hospitals for Covid treatment are unvaccinated. And while vaccine uptake among pregnant women rose from 23% in August to 54% at the end of last year, doctors believe thousands are still unvaccinated. In December, the UK government's vaccine watchdog, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, made pregnant women a priority group for jabs after studies found women were more likely to become seriously ill if they caught Covid while pregnant. The infection is also linked to a greater risk of stillbirth and preterm birth. The vaccines appear to reduce the risk of stillbirth by protecting against severe disease, but the study found only hints that the vaccine reduced preterm births, too. 'The best way to protect pregnant women and their babies is to get the Covid vaccine,' Khalil said. 'Even if a pregnant woman thinks they will be fine if they get Covid, that it will be mild for them, there's a potential advantage for the baby.' Edward Morris, the president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said the paper provided further reassurance that Covid vaccination was safe in pregnancy. 'We know women have been hesitant about having the vaccine due to concerns over the effect on their baby. We now have strong evidence to show that the vaccine does not increase the risk of adverse outcomes and is the best way of protecting both women and their babies. 'We would recommend all pregnant women have the Covid-19 vaccine and the booster vaccine. Covid-19 is still prevalent and if you do get the virus when you're pregnant then you are at higher risk of severe illness.'", "fd78aebcbae42c9be422ad2f33d08e735fda15a67659316c206b4c40": "A former Facebook moderator has filed a lawsuit against its owner, Meta Platforms, alleging poor working conditions for contracted content moderators violate the Kenyan constitution. The petition, also filed against Meta's local outsourcing company Sama, alleges that workers moderating Facebook posts in Kenya have been subjected to unreasonable working conditions including irregular pay, inadequate mental health support, union-busting, and violations of their privacy and dignity. The lawsuit, filed by one person on behalf of a group, seeks financial compensation, an order that outsourced moderators get the same health care and pay scale as Meta employees, that unionisation rights be protected, and an independent human rights audit of the office. A Meta spokesperson told Reuters: 'We take our responsibility to the people who review content for Meta seriously and require our partners to provide industry-leading pay, benefits and support. We also encourage content reviewers to raise issues when they become aware of them and regularly conduct independent audits to ensure our partners are meeting the high standards we expect.' Sama declined to comment before seeing the lawsuit but has previously rejected claims that its employees were paid unfairly, that the recruitment process was opaque, or that its mental health benefits were inadequate. The lawsuit's specific requests for action are more granular and wide-ranging than those sought in previous cases and could reverberate beyond Kenya. 'This could have ripple effects. Facebook is going to have to reveal a lot about how they run their moderation operation,' said Odanga Madung, a fellow at the Mozilla Foundation, a US-based global nonprofit dedicated to internet rights. Globally, thousands of moderators review social media posts that could depict violence, nudity, racism or other offensive content. Many work for third-party contractors rather than tech companies. Meta has already faced scrutiny over content moderators' working conditions. Last year, a California judge approved an $85m settlement between Facebook and more than 10,000 content moderators who had accused the company of failing to protect them from psychological injuries resulting from their exposure to graphic and violent imagery. Facebook did not admit wrongdoing in the California case but agreed to take measures to provide its content moderators, who are employed by third-party vendors, with safer work environments. The Kenyan lawsuit was filed on behalf of Daniel Motaung, who was recruited in 2019 from South Africa to work for Sama in Nairobi. Motaung says he was not given details about the nature of the work reviewing Facebook posts before his arrival. The first video Motaung remembers moderating was of a beheading. He says his pay and mental health support were inadequate to cope with the disturbing content. 'I have been diagnosed with severe PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder),' Motaung told Reuters. 'I am living ... a horror movie.' Motaung's lawyers said that Meta and Sama created a dangerous and degrading environment where workers were not given the same protections as employees in other countries. 'If in Dublin people can't look at harmful content for two hours, that should be the rule everywhere,' Motaung's lawyer Mercy Mutemi said. 'If they need to have a psychologist on call, that should apply everywhere.' Shortly after joining Sama, Motaung tried to form a union to advocate for the company's roughly 200 workers in Nairobi. He was fired soon after, which he and his lawyers say was because of the unionisation attempt. Union rights are enshrined in the Kenyan constitution. Sama has not commented on this allegation. Motaung's experience was first revealed in an investigation published by Time magazine in February.

Sponsored by the Republican Texas senator John Cornyn and the Democratic Delaware senator Chris Coons, the Supreme Court Police Parity Act passed on Monday unanimously and without objection. The bipartisan bill now advances to the House for consideration and, if approved, would head to Joe Biden's desk for the president's signature. Cornyn and Coons's bill generally aims to provide supreme court justices and their immediate relatives with security that is equivalent to what is granted to members of the federal government's legislative and executive branches. It came after the 2 May leak of a draft opinion which showed five conservatives on the nine-justice court had voted to reverse Roe v Wade, the 1973 decision which in effect made abortion legal nationwide. Conservatives celebrated the leak, which seemingly left Roe v Wade poised to fall in the summer. But liberals protested against it, and some activists gathered outside the Maryland homes of the chief justice, John Roberts, and his fellow conservative associate Brett Kavanaugh to make their displeasure known. The demonstrations outside the homes of Roberts and Kavanaugh were peaceful. Nonetheless, in a statement on Monday, the US Marshals Service confirmed the agency was assisting the supreme court with 'increased security concerns stemming from the unauthorized release of the draft opinion'. Coons, in a separate statement ahead of the bill's passage on Monday, added: 'The events of the past week have intensified the focus on supreme court justices' families, who are unfortunately facing threats to their safety in today's increasingly polarized political climate. We must act to ensure justices and their families are protected from those who wish to cause them harm by extending supreme court police security to family members.' Coons added that relatives of the high court's justices essentially 'have the same profile and exposure as the highest-ranking officials in our government,' making them equally deserving of protection. As for the White House, the press secretary, Jen Psaki, issued a statement on Monday on Twitter admonishing protesters to 'never include violence, threats or vandalism' as part of their demonstrations. 'Judges perform an incredibly important function in our society, and they must be able to do their jobs without concern for their personal safety,' Psaki said. The bill from Cornyn and Coons was not the only measure taken to beef up security around the supreme court's justices. Crews also installed an 8ft-tall fence that is purportedly non-scalable around parts of the supreme court's building, and they erected concrete barriers blocking the street in front of the complex.", "e264a8fcb04fb7a79ad8adee0dda750d09f926afee7e769c446651f2": "Peloton's share price crashed 20% in early trading after the exercise bike maker missed revenue targets, cut sales guidance and reported a bigger quarterly loss than anticipated, and its boss described turning the company around as 'emotionally draining'. Peloton, whose market value has fallen by more than 80% over the last year, reported revenues of $964m (PS780m), down from $1.26bn in the same quarter last year, as the pandemic-enforced trend for home workouts that fuelled a surge in sales of its hi-tech, internet-connected exercise bikes peters out. The company, which missed analyst revenue estimates by about $6m in its fiscal third quarter to the end of March, reported a loss of $757m. 'Turnarounds are hard work,' the chief executive, Barry McCarthy, who took over from the co-founder John Foley in February, said in a letter to shareholders. 'It's intellectually challenging, emotionally draining, physically exhausting, and all-consuming. It's a full-contact sport.' In January, Peloton said in a message to its 3,200 staff that it needed to 'evaluate' its workforce, subsequently cutting thousands of jobs, and indicated it needed to implement production curbs because of a slump in demand. 'The balance sheet challenge has been managing inventory,' said McCarthy, a former chief financial officer at Spotify and Netflix. 'We have too much for the current run rate of the business, and that inventory has consumed an enormous amount of cash, more than we expected, which has caused us to rethink our capital structure. Fortunately the obsolescence risk on this is negligible, and we believe the inventory will sell eventually. So this is primarily a cashflow timing issue, not a structural issue.' Peloton said it expected to report revenues of $675m to $700m in its fourth quarter, well below analysts' average estimate of $820.9m. The company said this was due to 'softer demand' compared with its previous guidance, and recent hardware price reductions. Peloton said the number of members grew 5% quarter-on-quarter to 7 million, with the number of workouts during the quarter growing by almost a third to 184.3m. The company, which is implementing a price increase to its monthly subscription fee from 1 June, said it had only experienced a 'modest' customer churn rate so far this year. It said it had signed a deal with JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs to borrow $750m in five-year term debt. Peloton has said it is not seeking a sale, but reports suggested the company may look to sell a stake of as much as 20% of the business to an outside investor to accelerate its turnaround strategy.", "e44235fd5a76a0d3a0ff55a4087c963b630143b05c5bf69b24610bf7": "Speaking from the White House, Joe Biden laid the blame for rising costs on two key factors: a 'once-in-a-century pandemic' that shut down the global economy and snarled supply chains and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, who invaded Ukraine and sent the cost of gas and food soaring.  'I want every American to know that I'm taking inflation very seriously and it's my top domestic priority,' Biden said.  Republicans and some economists have accused the White House of being slow to recognize the urgency of inflation, which Biden once suggested would be temporary. But as costs continue to climb, Biden has re-oriented his agenda to address inflation, which he said was the nation's 'top economic challenge right now.' Biden is now assailing Republicans for their economic agenda, which he said is making inflation worse. He blamed them for being 'extreme' and more interested in protecting large corporations than working families.  'In this moment of peril, with the war overseas and inflation surging around the world, the last thing we should be thinking about is rewarding companies for exploiting the situation,' Biden said.  The president is now pulling from Scott's aforementioned 11-point plan, warning that Republicans are a threat to beloved social-safety net programs like social security and Medicare.  Even if Republicans don't ultimately want to end those programs, Biden said they would use the threat as a 'hostage' to get their way on other issues.  At present, Biden is still meeting with House speaker Nancy Pelosi and other members of a congressional delegation that visited Ukraine earlier this month to discuss their experience in the war-torn country. Later this evening, the House is expected to vote tonight on a nearly $40bn military and humanitarian aid package.  Meanwhile, voters in Nebraska and West Virginia are still casting ballots in a series of primary elections that will test Donald Trump's enduring influence over his party. In West Virginia, Trump waded into a contentious Republican primary between two sitting members of Congress, endorsing congressman Alex Mooney over congressman David McKinley, who infuriated the former president when he voted for the creation of a House committee to investigate the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. And in Nebraska, Trump endorsed Charles Herbster to be the Republican nominee for governor in a bitter, nine-way primary race to replace the sitting Republican governor, who is limited. Herbster is accused of groping multiple women, allegations he has denied. During an Oval Office visit, Italian Premier Mario Draghi urged Biden and world leaders to work toward 'the possibility of bringing a ceasefire' between Ukraine and Russia in the hope of restarting negotiations.  'In Italy and Europe now, people want to put an end to these massacres and this violence, this butchery,' he said.  Here's a fuller analysis of the meeting from the Associated Press, which stated that the visit 'provided a window into divergent approaches' to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  In a floor speech on Tuesday, New York congressman Tom Reed announced that he was resigning with more than seven months left of his term.  Last year, Reed announced he would not seek re-election after he was accused of sexual misconduct.  In his speech, Reed denounced the 'the focus on extremism', according to Politico.  'I am leaving to continue that work and hope to have a greater impact on our country,' he added.  Reed was among the lawmakers in his state who called for the resignation of former New York governor Andrew Cuomo over sexual harassment allegations. And late last year, Reed said he was considering running for governor to challenge Cuomo, who later resigned amid the cascading scandal.  After the accusations against the congressman, Reed said in a statement apologizing for his behavior that he would not run for any office in 2022. The Guardian's David Smith looks at what the fight over abortion rights tells us about the divisions in America today.  This opening scenes encapsulates the current political climate well.  Whether Democrats support the pro-choice protests outside the homes of Supreme Court justices has become a hot topic in Washington as passions intensify ahead of a ruling poised to strip millions of Americans of access to abortion. During a press conference today, Schumer was asked whether he was comfortable with the protests. He said he was as long as they remained peaceful. The president blessed a plan to unhitch Ukraine assistance and coronavirus funding. But now there's no clear path forward on passing pandemic funding for tests, vaccines and therapeutics.  'Should Americans start preparing for shortages?' a reporter asked.  'We don't want to sugarcoat it: we need more money,' Psaki said. 'We don't have a plan B here.'  She was asked if the president would be OK with holding a vote on Title 42, a pandemic-era public health order that is being used to control immigration at the border. The administration has said it plans to lift the order, but Republicans and some Democrats oppose the decision, which is tied up in court proceedings. Now Republicans want Democrats to allow a vote on keeping Title 42 in place before they will support Biden's request for pandemic funding. Psaki said it was a hypothetical and she wouldn't speculate on what the legislative path forward would be.  In response to a question on whether Biden would support businesses leaving states that impose abortion bans should Roe fall, Psaki said she hadn't spoken to the president about this yet. Biden previously supported efforts by companies and sports teams to leverage their clout to pressure conservative states to back off restrictive voting legislation.  The first question is about inflation, specifically, whether Biden thinks the size of his coronavirus relief bill contributed to rising costs. Earlier today, the president said he believed his policies had 'helped, not hurt' the economy.  Psaki said many economists agree that the pandemic is a major cause of inflation, and that his domestic agenda has helped combat the virus, which is necessary for bringing down costs. She also pointed to the war in Ukraine as another factor, which Biden will continue to highlight on his travels outside of Washington.  A reporter also asked who came up with the term 'ultra-MAGA', which the president unveiled as a new epithet for Trump-friendly Republicans.  'It's the president's phrase,' Psaki said, explaining that Biden has been 'struck' by how 'extreme some of the policies and proposals' that certain Republicans support are. 'Adding a little ultra to it gives it a little extra pop.' Another reporter pressed her on why Biden said a 'majority' of Republicans supported Scott's 11-point plan when many have sought to distance themselves from it, Psaki rattled off a list of quotes from Republicans who had praised the agenda.  She has been asked multiple questions about the protests outside the justices' homes after the leaked supreme court draft that showed the court was poised to overturn Roe. Psaki said she understood passions were high and that the president and the White House strongly supported the right to peaceful protest, and stressed that the protests have so far remained peaceful at the justices' homes. She also said there was 'hypocrisy' on the part of Republicans who are upset over these protests and yet remained silent when their supporters intimidated school board members and election officials.  The decision to let Trump back on Twitter was one for the private sector to make, she said, responding to an interview in which Musk said he would reverse the ban against the former president. But Psaki said the White House's goal was to protect freedom of speech while ensuring social media platforms don't become a 'forum for disinformation.' Jen Psaki, the outgoing White House press secretary, is now briefing reporters on Biden's Wednesday trip to Illinois, where he will visit a family farm to highlight 'Putin's price hike' and the impact on food prices.  She also announced that he will host Pelosi and other congressional members this afternoon in the Situation Room to hear more about their trip to Ukraine.  A New York appeals court has dismissed a lawsuit by state attorney general Letitia James against Amazon over its coronavirus safety protocols, and against a former employee who led the successful union organizing effort on Staten Island, the Associated Press reports. The suit had claimed that Amazon potentially exposed workers to Covid-19 at two facilities in New York city, and that the company illegally retaliated against workers who spoke up about poor safety conditions in its warehouses. They included Chris Smalls, the fired Amazon worker who heads the Amazon labor union, and Derrick Palmer, the group's vice president of organizing. The appellate court's ruling Tuesday said federal labor law preempted state labor law, and the national labor relations board 'should serve as the forum' for disputes, not the states. Palmer, who was given a final written warning in the early days of the pandemic, is still employed at Amazon. The court's ruling is a win for Amazon, which had sought to have the case thrown out. Neither Amazon, nor James' office immediately responded to the AP's request for comment.  Elon Musk, the Tesla chief executive and world's richest person who recently agreed a deal to buy Twitter for $44bn, says he will reverse the social media platform's permanent ban on former president Donald Trump. The decision to ban Trump from Twitter did not silence his voice, but rather amplified his views among people on the political right, Musk said, during remarks on Tuesday at the Financial Times future of the car conference. Calling the ban 'morally wrong and flat-out stupid', Musk said: Trump was banned permanently two days after inciting the deadly 6 January Capitol attack for breaching Twitter rules. The platform's owners cited 'the risk of further incitement of violence' for its decision. Musk, who has called himself a 'free speech absolutist,' said he would reverse the ban, but noted: Trump, meanwhile, says he wants no further part of a platform where he once enjoyed a following of more than 85m. He told Fox News last month he was going to stay instead on Truth Social, the failing anti-Twitter rival he rarely uses.

Amal became an international symbol of displacement and loss - but also of compassion and generosity - when, with a team of puppeteers and support workers, she walked from Gaziantep near the Turkish-Syrian border to Manchester between July and October. This week the 3.5-metre puppet will visit the Polish cities of Lublin and Krakow to meet Ukrainian refugee children and families who have left their homes since Russia launched its military offensive on 20 February. Amir Nizar Zuabi, the artistic director of The Walk, Amal's trans-European journey, said: 'At a time of unprecedented global change, Amal's journeys transcend borders, politics and language to tell a new story of shared humanity - and to ensure the world doesn't forget the millions of displaced children, each with their own potential to enhance the communities in which, as we hope, they will find refuge.' The Polish trip, which includes visiting Przemysl, a town close to the border with Ukraine, is at the invitation of the mayors of Lublin and Krakow and the Ukrainian embassy in Poland. Amal and her crew have taken with them aid and supplies aimed at the needs of young children. Aleksander Sola, the vice-president of the Folkowisko Foundation, which is supporting the trip, said: 'We hope that Amal will draw the world's attention to the refugee crisis that Europe has not seen since the end of world war two. Amal symbolises the millions of refugees who have been forced to leave their homes.' Amal, whose name means hope in Arabic, was created by Handspring, the company that made the equine puppets in War Horse. Three puppeteers are needed to operate Amal.", "fade7dba788faf2c490a3047c4b3a603fdd662217ba27afa9eb85deb": "Tensions between Shanghai residents and China's Covid enforcers are on the rise again, amid a new push to end infections outside quarantine zones to meet President Xi Jinping's demand for achieving 'dynamic zero-Covid'. Videos shared on China's social media platforms showed suspected Covid-positive patients forcibly quarantined in central facilities. In some neighbourhoods a single positive case could lead to residents in the entire apartment building be sent for quarantine. Censors have been taking down many of these videos, but determined residents have continued to post them. Past speeches by top officials and legal scholars have resurfaced in which they speak of the importance of the rule of law. These speeches have been shared and reposted on social media to express disapproval of government policy. Last week, Xi reiterated that his government had no intention of turning away from the controversial zero-Covid commitment, in a major speech to the country's senior cadres. He urged officials to 'unswervingly adhere to the general policy of dynamic zero-Covid' and warned against any criticism or doubting of the policy. Over the weekend, residents in at least four of Shanghai's 16 districts reported receiving notices that told them they would no longer be able to receive food deliveries or leave their homes, prompting numerous complaints on social media. 'The virus itself is no longer scary, but the way the government enforced the policy has become the most frightening thing,' said one Shanghai resident, who wished to remain anonymous. 'We had thought the lockdown could be eased this month, but now there's no end in sight again.' In the past few days, a number of videos shared on social media showed that health officials - also called Dabai, or 'Big Whites' due to their white hazmat suits - entered residents' homes and sprayed disinfectants everywhere. This practice outraged many residents, who questioned the legality. Others asked whether such a measure had any scientific basis. In one viral video, hazmat-suited enforcement officers ordered residents to be quarantined after a neighbour tested positive. 'It's not that you can do whatever you want - unless you're in America. This is China,' one of the officers is heard saying. 'Stop asking me why, there is no why. We have to adhere to national guidelines.' The Guardian does not know the identities of the residents and whether they were eventually taken away. Not all Shanghai residents were compliant. In a separate video, a local resident addressed government health workers to abide by China's law. The middle-aged man, clad in a red protective suit with a face mask and a face shield, pointed out that there was always a limit to the power government officials are entitled to, and citizens' rights should not be abused. 'Let me tell you,' the man said, 'you can only use your power with the authorisation of law ... You have to tell me which items in our country's law allowed you to carry out your public power today? ... Therefore, you cannot enforce hard isolation [upon us].' It is not the first time that the government's enforcement of zero-Covid has led to tensions in Shanghai, home to 25 million people and a key financial hub in Asia. In April, residents in Pudong - the eastern part of the city - scuffled with hazmat-suited police who were forcing them to surrender their homes to become coronavirus quarantine facilities. Worried about Covid-prevention excesses, legal scholars have voiced their concerns. On Sunday, a long appeal letter urging the government to abide by China's constitution was widely shared on social media. Censors took down the article multiple times but many determined residents continued to post it. The lead author of the letter, Prof Tong Zhiwei at Shanghai's East China University of Political Science and Law, said the restrictions and the way the authorities enforced them could lead to 'some kind of legal disaster'. 'Pandemic prevention needs to be balanced with ensuring people's rights and freedoms,' Tong wrote. 'Local governments and officials need to stick to the constitution and laws, and cannot destroy the rule of law for convenience.' Guobin Yang, a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of the book The Wuhan Lockdown, said: 'Like what we've seen in Wuhan in 2020 when the virus first emerged, citizens are protesting against the government's blunt enforcement of lockdowns. Shanghai has taken this dynamic to a new level, but we still don't know how the government will respond in the end.' Shanghai is in its sixth week of lockdown. Case numbers have been decreasing, according to local health officials. On Monday, Shanghai reported 322 locally transmitted Covid cases, 3,625 local asymptomatic infections, and 11 deaths for the previous 24 hours. It was a continued drop in new cases for the 10th straight day. It is not just Shanghai that has been under some form of restrictions. In Beijing, where daily case numbers are far below Shanghai's at this point in its outbreak, the government has asked residents to work from home. Dozens of bus routes and almost 15% of the Chinese capital's sprawling subway system have been suspended.", "0236b3d90c7f9278ecf9c892f317a3120bc37b463a73e719b09b2e8a": "Grindr plans to float through a merger with a so-called Spac investment company in a deal that values the gay dating app at $2.1bn (PS1.7bn). The app will receive $384m as part of the deal with Tiga Acquisition Corp (TAC), the Singapore-based special purpose acquisition company (Spac) - also known as a 'blank cheque' shell company that raises money first and seeks businesses to buy later. Grindr, which launched in 2009 and specialises in dating among the LGBTQ+ community, had 10.8 million monthly active users last year. Of these 723,000 paid for one of its subscription services, called Xtra and Unlimited, with paying users up 31% over 2020. The average amount of time users spend on the app each day hit 61 minutes in December and 80% of profiles on Grindr are 35 years old or younger - with just 11% aged 41 or older - according to the company's investor presentation. The company's revenues rose 30% last year to $147m - and it expects growth of between 35% and 40% this year - and made $77m in adjusted profits. The valuation is more than triple the $608m that owner San Vicente Acquisition paid for Grindr two years ago. Grindr said that as part of the deal, which will result in existing shareholders owning about 78% of the company, the chief executive, Jeff Bonforte, would step down. 'It has been the longstanding goal of Grindr's current ownership and management that Grindr be led by members of the LGBTQ+ community,' the company said in a statement announcing the deal. 'Working together, Grindr's board and management have identified and been in discussions with a potential new chief executive officer candidate who would bring a depth and breadth of experience across technology, finance, and management, including time spent in an executive leadership role at a public company.' Grindr, which is based in West Hollywood, California, and Tiga said the deal may require clearance from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which vets deals for potential national security risks. In 2019, CFIUS ordered the Chinese gaming company Kunlun Tech Co, then owner of Grindr, to sell the company over concerns that personal data of US users could be accessed and used by China's government. The company sold Grindr a year later for $608m. The deal means Grindr will join the much larger $20bn Match group, which owns dating brands including Tinder and Hinge and has about 100 million users in total, and Bumble, which has about 40 million users, as publicly listed dating apps.", "787a16e9b7872d887ef74e4deedbfb6d4c746dd666bde956b6fe37a6": "Stanford University said it found a noose hanging from a tree outside a residence hall and is investigating the incident as a hate crime.

The Guardian speaks to a woman imprisoned for setting fire to a cushion and a prison officer running a unit for the sickest prisoners. Shell Ball cannot remember exactly what was going through her head when she set fire to a cushion in her home in Crewe in 2019. But she had been struggling to cope with the death of her fiance, Gary, who had started drinking heavily again after they lost a baby. 'I got quite drunk and I really don't know why but I set fire to the corner of a cushion. Upstairs had heard me shouting and called the police,' she said. It was the start of a nightmare that would result in Ball - who has been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, PTSD and borderline personality disorder - being imprisoned and then twice recalled to prison after attempting to take her own life. In total she would spend nearly a year and a half behind bars and lose custody of her youngest son - all for setting fire to a cushion, as a cry for help. Ball, 38, was held in a police station over that fateful weekend, charged with reckless arson. The following Monday she went to court and was remanded in HMP Styal, Cheshire - just a week after Gary had died. Ball was inconsolable. 'I cried for two weeks. I just couldn't stop crying. My world had fallen apart and now I was in prison,' she said. When her case was heard she wrote a heartfelt letter to the judge explaining what had happened in her life, from being raped as a teenager to losing a child and a partner - but she was still sent back to prison. '[The judge] said: 'I know you didn't have any intention of hurting anyone that night other than yourself,' but he gave me two years.' Ball started self-harming as it gave her 'some release' from the hopelessness of her situation. 'There's no light at the end of the tunnel. A lot of people in prison are the same and that's why people kill themselves and self-harm,' she said. While she was at Styal, at least one woman died. 'About 90% of the women in there had mental health issues - most probably that's why they were in there in the first place,' she said. The prison put her on a plan for those at risk of self-harm and suicide. But she was only given the opportunity to speak to a psychiatrist on the phone just before she was released. 'It was pointless.' She struggled to cope outside as she had not received any sustained treatment in prison and was recalled after two suicide attempts. Ball appealed to the Parole Board but was turned down: 'How can I get recalled for trying to take my own life? How's that criminal?' Ball was eventually released in August 2021 and has been getting her life back together. But she believes she should never have been sent to prison: 'I don't see myself as a criminal. I wanted to hurt myself. I wanted to die. I should have been sectioned in hospital and got the help I needed, which would have caused a lot less pain.' 'A lot of officers avoid coming on to this [mental health] unit because they class it as the most dangerous part of the prison. You could open a door one day and the man in front of you could be nice as pie. You could open the door an hour later and he'd come out swinging punches. 'Self-harm is quite high. We don't allow them to have razors or any sharp objects. But that doesn't stop people. We've had people rip wall tiles off the showers and self-harm with them. We had a guy who tried to cut his own jugular a few months back. 'We see it as containment rather than any form of treatment. We keep them locked in mostly. We do let them out for a bit of association and we do take them outside for exercise. But on hospital wards they are out all day. It's a much more relaxed environment. There are nurses to medicate them. 'In prisons, we can't always give them the same medication they were prescribed in the community because certain drugs aren't allowed within prison walls. Opioid-based medications are banned because they become currency. 'A lot of these people end up in prison due to their mental health. I'm looking at my board at the moment: from the eight that I've got in the unit today, there's only one that I would say doesn't fall into that category. There's one in for carrying a bladed article. Another for harassment. He stood in the street shouting. He has psychosis and hears voices. Another person attacked a neighbour because he was playing music too loud. And a lot of these are under care in the community anyway, even before they come to us. They are ill. It is inhumane [to put them in prison].'

'Starmer accused of piling pressure on police,' the paper's front-page headline said on Tuesday, directly below a red banner saying, 'Beergate: Day 13', a tally of how many days, some might argue, the paper has been trying to persuade Starmer to do exactly what he has now done. The Labour leader's decision to pledge that he would resign if issued with a penalty over an April campaign event in Durham last year, where he was pictured holding a beer, 'placed detectives in the difficult position' of knowing their decision would have major political ramifications, the Mail story warned. One unnamed government source said 'ministers were concerned that Sir Keir's intervention could place 'undue pressure' on Durham Constabulary to clear Sir Keir, or at least refrain from fining him'. A separate editorial comment from the paper said, in typically steadfast style, that Starmer's televised statement announcing the decision 'combined lawyerly weasel words with trademark sanctimony'. In a section that seemingly hints at a lack of contact between those writing the editorials and the team in charge of news, the comment added: 'Superficially of course, he appears to be doing the decent thing, though frankly, he didn't have much choice.' The lack of choice would arguably be the message regular readers would have taken from the 13 days - and counting - of Mail coverage about 'beergate'. One front page, on 30 April, boomed: 'Police told to investigate Labour's lies.' A series of other similar front pages urged Durham police to look again at an incident that they had concluded in February had broken no Covid rules, and then explained at length how untenable Starmer's position would be if the force changed its mind. Other stories have detailed what the paper insists are inconsistencies in Labour's narrative about the evening in question, and reasons why it demonstrably broke guidelines in place at the time. It is, of course, now a matter for Durham police, who have some experience in politically charged Covid investigations, having decided to take no action against Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson's then-chief adviser, for his ill-advised drives through their territory in the peak of lockdown. No one, beyond perhaps a handful of experienced detectives, knows what they will decide. But one thing seems clear: whatever happens, the Daily Mail will not be especially happy.", "394d664348fc3df38ade86a640526754ae4c062c97419b5dc34909d0": "", "cd139bb3d37d809f81cefec2b416d37e8df73ab0bdd75fd97baae2b5": "", "e102ca911604a2170285d62ffe7e174b1082be72f4bd134ae274a803": "Russia's ambassador to Poland has been pelted with red paint thrown at him by people protesting against the war in Ukraine as he went to lay flowers at the Soviet military cemetery in Warsaw on the anniversary of the allied victory over Nazi Germany in 1945. Video footage released by Russian news agencies showed Sergey Andreev and several other men with paint on their clothes and faces surrounded by a crowd, some holding Ukrainian flags. In other videos of the incident circulating online, anti-war activists can be heard chanting 'fascists' and 'murderers'. Andreev told the Russian news agency Tass that he and his team had not been seriously hurt in the incident. The protesters prevented the ambassador from laying flowers at the cemetery and Polish police escorted him away. Russia's foreign ministry responded to the incident by demanding Warsaw organise a new wreath-laying ceremony immediately and saying Poland should 'ensure complete protection against any provocations'. The war in Ukraine has overshadowed this year's Victory Day when Russia remembers the 27 million Soviet citizens who lost their lives in the second world war. Poland, which has taken in millions of Ukrainian refugees, cancelled all official commemorations of the anniversary. Speaking during a trip to Iran, the Polish foreign minister, Zbigniew Rau, said: 'It is an incident that should not have happened, an incident that is, by all means, regrettable.' He said diplomats enjoyed special protection regardless of the policies pursued by the authorities of their countries. The Polish interior minister, Mariusz Kaminski, tweeted: 'The gathering of opponents of Russian aggression against Ukraine, where genocide takes place every day, was legal. The emotions of Ukrainian women participating in the demonstration, whose husbands courageously fight for the defence of the Motherland, are understandable. 'The Polish authorities did not recommend the Russian ambassador to lay flowers on 9 May in Warsaw. The police allowed the ambassador to safely leave the scene.' The Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said the 'admirers of neo-Nazism have again shown their faces', repeating Kremlin claims that Russia is fighting fascists in Ukraine. The incident is likely to further raise tensions between Moscow and Warsaw, with Poland emerging as a key arms supply route in the Ukraine war. Russian officials have claimed without evidence that Poland aspires to annex the western regions of Ukraine, and Warsaw refused earlier this month to pay the Russian energy giant Gazprom in roubles, leading to a halt in gas supplies to the country.", "4f4a6bcdf5b3d2a288388385e61176342ced774cd9eb62016619e305": "The Pulitzer prizes have honoured the journalists of Ukraine with a special citation hailing the country's reporters for the 'courage, endurance and commitment to truthful reporting' that they have shown since the Russian invasion.

By the end there was so little food and water that adults were eating one tiny meal a day. Two cups of macaroni went into 10 litres of water, and that 'soup' had to feed 30 people. The children ate twice. Still, they all shared their food with their pet. 'Someone would give him a spoon of porridge and everyone in the family would give him three or four spoons when they ate. Luckily, he is small,' said Olena Chekhonatski. She fled underground to escape shelling at the start of the war with her husband, Yegor, and two sons, 12-year-old Artem and 17-year-old Dmitry. They expected to stay perhaps two weeks, but only emerged two months later. 'I was never a dog person before Spike arrived,' she said with a rueful glance at the dog she starved herself to keep alive, as he bounded along the sandy shore of the Dnieper river on the family's first day of freedom since late February. The family were in the very last group of civilians officially evacuated from Azovstal, arriving in Ukrainian-held territory on the evening before Putin declared his war as a 'sacred' mission to liberate people like their family, at a military parade in Moscow. 'What liberation? What was the reason for all that?' Olena asked. 'Our first feeling is disbelief we made it out. The last days we were losing hope. The shelling was so heavy, it seemed impossible to get out,' Yegor added. While the family thought that they might be in the bunker for two weeks, others they sheltered with had prepared for only two days. More than two months later, they were still there, supplies of food and water dwindling as the buildings above them were ripped apart by Russian bombs. They had been deprived of almost everything except sleep. 'Sleep more, eat less. Because when you are asleep, you don't need to eat,' Yegor said. 'The plan now is to keep on living. The rest will follow.' When they moved in, there was electricity, but their world rapidly shrank in the mouldy basement, its dank smell seeping into their clothes and skin. The electricity was cut off after a day, and there was no internet, just a small radio that could pick up some longwave transmissions. They used car batteries to power LED lights, and in the gloom tried to make the hours pass with games. They had brought chess, backgammon and cards, and someone made a Mariupol monopoly set, with the city's industrial plants and malls replacing the streets of London. They can laugh about some things now. They foraged for food in the remains of a warehouse that had been bombed by the Russians, and one day Yegor went with two older men, who insisted on joining them despite their failing strength and eyesight. One came back with coffee beans he had mistaken for small pasta shapes and a giant bag of bay leaves. Neither helped with hunger, but they decided to crush the coffee with a hammer. 'I should say, it was a great cup of coffee,' he said. But every day was a gamble with death. Even a trip to the toilet meant risking their lives, because the latrines were on the ground floor. For children and older and disabled people, there were buckets in the shelter, which the adults took turns emptying. 'No one came out of there unchanged,' said Oksana, an Azovstal employee who asked not to give her full name for security reasons. 'They were one person when they went in, and another person when they came out.' In the early days, the children were obviously traumatised, she said. The teenagers spent hours staring at the walls, the younger children shied away from touch, and when she encouraged them to draw, they avoided the coloured pens and would do pictures only in black. Over time they adjusted a little to their terrifying new existence. 'Later they let us hug them, especially during the bombing. They made friends, and the older kids taught the younger kids. There was a four-year-old who could barely read the alphabet when they arrived, but by the end he could do maths and read and write well.' Oksana herself has emerged with three talismans from her descent into horror: her husband's teaspoon, from his work canteen; drawings by the children she guided through this time; and a passport cover with gleaming beadwork that she added herself, the only piece of her work she has left from a favourite hobby. 'I have nothing else from home.' They tried to leave when a 'green corridor' was announced in early March, but were driven back underground by fighting. They had watched dozens of people leave before them, including residents of a neighbouring bunker that ran out of food weeks before they did, but each trip was a gamble. 'When the children went outside, we made tags on their clothes with their names, blood types and date of birth. So at least if they were killed it would be easier to identify the bodies,' Oksana said. One group decided to hike the 100km to Berdyansk, through battlefields, minefields and ruins, because that seemed less terrifying than staying at the plant. 'We don't know if they made it.' Then they heard about the final attempts to set up civilian rescue corridors on the radio and decided to see if they could find a way out. Soldiers found them waiting outside, and said they had 15 minutes to get ready. They worry that there may be other desperate civilians trapped under the plant, who didn't have radios to learn about the evacuation, or weren't found by the soldiers. At a Russian 'filtration' camp, where evacuees are searched by authorities, the Chekhonatski family met a teenager who had spent the whole war hiding in a basement a few dozen metres from theirs with two other men. They had no idea he was there. They also worry about the troops who got them out, through the ruined complex. 'Not even heroes ... I don't know how to describe it. There's no word to express all our gratitude for what they've done for us,' Yegor said. 'I beg God, I hope some miracle happens and they make it out of there alive.' Oksana was overwhelmed, when she was finally able to charge her phone and turn it on after two months, to find a flood of messages from family, relatives and friends from across Ukraine and around the world. Many were the beneficiaries of a charity where she worked, which provided food and other aid to families with young children. 'I never imagined I would be the one needing help.'

The articles on Lenta.ru called President Vladimir Putin a 'pitiful paranoid dictator' and accused him of waging 'the bloodiest war of the 21st century'. 'We had to do it today. We wanted to remind everyone what our grandfathers really fought for on this beautiful Victory Day - for peace,' said 30-year-old Egor Polyakov, one of the two journalists. During his annual speech in front of 11,000 soldiers in the Kremlin on Monday morning, Putin sought to justify his invasion of Ukraine, tying the current fighting to the Soviet victory in the second world war. 'This is not what Victory Day is about,' Polyakov told the Guardian in an interview. 'Ordinary people are dying, peaceful women and children are dying in Ukraine. Given the rhetoric that we have seen, this isn't going to stop. We couldn't accept this any longer. This was the only right thing we could do.' Polyakov, who works as a business reporter at Lenta, said he and his colleague Alexandra Miroshnikova published more than 40 articles critical of the Kremlin and its actions in Ukraine. The articles have since been taken down, but can be accessed through a web archive tool. Lenta, one of the largest sites in the country with more than 200 million monthly visitors, has been part of the relentless propaganda machine used to justify Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Lenta is owned by Rambler, a media group that was bought in 2020 by Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, which is state-owned and under US and UK sanctions. Titles on the articles written and published by Polyakov and Miroshnikova on Monday morning included 'Vladimir Putin lied about Russia's plans in Ukraine', 'The Russian army turned out to be an army of thieves and looters' and 'Russia abandons the dead bodies of its troops in Ukraine.' Polyakov said each article was sourced from 'information available online', which he said he was usually not allowed to use given the outlet's 'editorial position' and strict censorship rules that in effect criminalise independent reporting. Polyakov and Miroshkina also published a personal letter on the website, which urged readers: 'Don't be afraid! Don't be silent! Fight back! You are not alone, there are many of us! The future is ours!' It is the first major act of protest seen in Russian state media since Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at Channel One, broke on to the set of the nightly news in mid-March shouting: 'Stop the war. No to war.' Pointing to recent laws introduced by Russia aimed at stifling anti-war dissent, Polyakov said he was now 'worried' for his safety. Russia has passed a number of laws making the spread of 'fake' information about the Russian army an offence punishable with fines or jail terms of up to 15 years. Russian authorities have already charged 46 people under such laws, with 14 of them now behind bars. 'Of course I am afraid,' Polyakov said. 'I am not ashamed to admit that. But I knew what I was doing, what the consequences could be.' In a separate development, the Rutube video platform was taken down by pro-Ukrainian hackers on Sunday night, while local television menus were hacked, with programme descriptions on smart TVs replaced by a message reading: 'The blood of thousands of Ukrainians and hundreds of murdered children is on your hands. TV and the authorities are lying. No to war.' State outlets have frequently been targeted by pro-Ukrainian hackers since the start of the war.

The reunion had been decades in the making, the final details hastily hashed out as Russian tanks rolled on to the streets of Ukraine. 'The moment was both happy and sad,' said Angelika Batiai, 24. 'Here I was seeing my sister again after 20 years, but on the other hand I had just left my family and friends in a country at war.' The half-sisters had spent the first years of their lives together in the southern Ukrainian village of Nikolaev, leaning on each other as they grew up with only an absentee mother to care for them. Family problems left them separated soon after; five-year-old Angelika was sent to live with an aunt and Tatyana, six, with a grandmother before ending up in state care. They begged to be kept together, recalled Tatyana Kluge Garcia, 25. 'But economically it was impossible, Angelika's aunt couldn't afford to take us both in.' At the age of eight, Tatyana was adopted by a family in the Spanish city of Girona, near Barcelona, trading her arduous beginning for a new family, country and slate of languages. Even as her command of Ukrainian faded, her sister remained constantly in her thoughts. 'I always said that I would go to Ukraine and find her,' said Tatyana. As a teenager she scoured social media for any trace of her sister, even downloading the Russian social network VK at one point. More than 2,000 miles away in Ukraine, Angelika was doing the same. When she stumbled across a Facebook profile in 2019 that showed a beaming young woman in Spain, she was certain she had found Tatyana. 'I just knew it was my sister.' Within weeks the two were chatting constantly online, pushing past language and cultural barriers. 'It was like a girlfriend that you're getting to know but really it's your sister and you want to share your life with her,' said Tatyana. Excitedly they made plans to meet up in Spain, only to have the possibility derailed by the pandemic. In February, as Russian troops amassed on the border of Ukraine, Tatyana made a frantic call to Angelika. 'I told her that here they're saying that there's going to be a war,' she said. Angelika sought to temper her sister's fears. 'I was hoping all of this would blow over and everything would be fine,' she said. 'But it just got worse and worse.' She and her fiance left their home in Nova Odesa, heading to a nearby village where her cousin had converted his basement into a makeshift shelter. As the sound of bombings cracked in the distance, they would dart into the basement. 'Tatyana was texting me every day, saying pack up, we're all waiting for you, we're worried,' she said. Angelika canvassed those around her, but her loved ones were determined to stay. 'It was a very difficult decision because I didn't want to leave my family,' she said. 'I was also very worried about how I was going to get there on my own - it was a long way.' In the end it was a message from Tatyana's mother, reinforcing that she would be safe in Spain, that convinced Angelika. She set off for the Polish border in a vehicle with other Ukrainians looking to leave, steeling herself for the worst. 'I was terrified we would be detained or that there would be an air alert,' said Angelika. Her anxiety was laced with nervousness for what lay ahead: 'The whole way I was thinking about what it would be like to see my sister and whether she would accept me,' she said. From her home in Girona, Tatyana tracked Angelika's every step. She bought her a plane ticket from Warsaw, battling spotty mobile coverage and language barriers to make sure her sister made it on to the flight. 'I was going crazy,' said Tatyana. 'She had never been on a plane, she didn't know how to check in or check her baggage.' The days of anxiety melted away as soon as she spotted her sister. 'I had always wondered what that moment would be like,' said Tatyana. 'You think: 'Maybe I'll be in shock, maybe I won't know what to say, maybe I'll cry.' But in the end I just couldn't believe it was happening.' In the month since Angelika's arrival in Spain, the sisters have carved out a comfortable coexistence in Tatyana's apartment, using hand gestures, a handful of shared vocabulary and a lot of Google Translate to communicate. The ease of their interactions belies their decades apart; Angelika, who hates carrying a handbag, stuffs her phone and charger into her older sister's purse whenever they leave the house, while the two trade quiet nods of affirmation as they delve into the details of their past. 'There are days that go by and I'm looking at her and I still can't believe it,' said Tatyana. 'I just think: 'You're here.'' Echoing the uncertainty facing many of the 135,000 Ukrainian refugees who have arrived in Spain in recent months, neither sister knows what comes next: whether Angelika will eventually return to her fiance, job and family in Ukraine, or seek to bring them to Spain and start over. 'Since we were little we've been dreaming of seeing each other again, but we would never have imagined that it would be because of a war,' said Tatyana. For Angelika, being back with her sister was a 'wonderful, unbelievable feeling'. The joy, however, was rivalled by the angst of leaving her loved ones in a country at war.  'I just can't stop thinking about it.'", "1a826d949ca2b7b14973f908024e90a3ee8cc021cbe08564389a4f0d": "South Korea's new president, Yoon Suk-yeol, has offered North Korea 'an audacious plan' to transform its creaking economy in return for abandoning its nuclear weapons programme. Speaking on the first day of his presidency on Tuesday, Yoon said: 'While North Korea's nuclear weapon programmes are a threat not only to our security and that of North-east Asia, the door to dialogue will remain open so that we can peacefully resolve this threat.' Yoon has previously vowed to take a tougher stance against Pyongyang than his predecessor, but appears to have avoided provoking the regime amid speculation that it could be preparing to conduct a nuclear test. North Korea has previously rejected incentives tied to progress on abandoning its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. 'If North Korea genuinely embarks on a process to complete denuclearisation, we are prepared to work with the international community to present an audacious plan that will vastly strengthen North Korea's economy and improve the quality of life for its people,' he told a crowd of 40,000 people attending his inauguration outside the national assembly in Seoul, according to the Yonhap news agency. The North's missiles and nukes were a threat to South Korean, regional and global security, he said, adding: 'The door to dialogue will remain open so that we can peacefully resolve this threat.' Yoon, a conservative who replaced the liberal former human rights lawyer Moon Jae-in, officially began his presidency at midnight on Monday with a security briefing at an underground bunker - a sign that the North's nuclear weapons will be high on the agenda throughout his single five-year term. Pyongyang prefaced Yoon's inauguration, after a closely contested, rancorous campaign, by conducting a volley of test launches, including those involving long-range missiles. The North's leader, Kim Jong-un, could dramatically raise the diplomatic stakes very soon, with US and South Korean officials speculating that the regime could be preparing to conduct its first nuclear test since 2017 later this month, possibly around the time Yoon is due to meet Joe Biden in Seoul. 'North Korea has the initiative. Regardless of whether conservatives or liberals are in power in South Korea, North Korea is pressing ahead with missile tests under its own weapons development timetable before it tries to tip the balance later,' said Park Won Gon, a professor at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. 'North Korea will now continue its provocations, but there are no ways to stop it.' Yoon's decision to join his first security briefing in a bunker is symbolic of his campaign pledges to take a tougher stance on North Korea after Moon's attempts to engage with Kim failed to make progress on denuclearisation. In a recent interview with Voice of America, Yoon said that a meeting with Kim was not off the table, but would need to produce results. 'There's no reason to avoid meeting' Kim, he said. 'However, if we are not be able to show any results, or results are just for show and does not have actual outcomes in denuclearisation ... it's not going to help the relationship between the two Koreas progress.' At home, where he faces a deeply divided public and a hostile national assembly controlled by the main opposition Democratic party, Yoon will be expected to tackle inflation - now at a 13-year high - that threatens his campaign pledge to address growing inequality and rising property prices in the world's 10th biggest economy. Yoon, though, has been denied the usual honeymoon period enjoyed by new presidents. Only 55% of respondents expect him to do a good job as president - an unusually low figure compared to his predecessors - according to a poll by Gallup Korea. As Moon's former prosecutor-general, Yoon helped investigate another former president, Park Geun-hye, before she was impeached and imprisoned in 2017 for corruption and abuse of power. He has vowed to continue the fight against corruption, even as several of his cabinet nominees were accused of ethical lapses and misconduct. Yoon will also come under pressure to address simmering resentment among young men - a key source of support in the election - over what they perceive as unfair advantages given to women, even though South Korea fares poorly in gender equality. Yoon said he would abolish the country's gender equality ministry, but has since suggested that it is no longer a policy priority, leading to speculation that he will 'rebrand' the body rather than abolish it. He has also indicated he intends to build 'future-oriented' relations with Japan after years of tension linked to the countries' bitter wartime legacy. The North-east Asian neighbours have yet to resolve disputes over the Japanese military's use of Korean sex slaves before and during the second world war. They are also at loggerheads over compensation for Korean labourers forcibly brought to Japan during its 1910-1945 colonial rule of the Korean peninsula, and competing claims to the Takeshima islands, known as Dokdo by Koreans. In what is being seen as a sign of a possible thaw in relations, Yoon sent a delegation to Tokyo last month, while Japan's foreign minister, Yoshimasa Hayashi, was among 300 foreign guests at his swearing-in ceremony.

With more than 90% of an initial count concluded, Marcos Jr had almost 30 million votes, more than double the tally of his closest rival, the current vice-president, Leni Robredo, a former human rights lawyer. Supporters dressed in red shirts, his campaign colour, gathered outside his camp's headquarters in Mandaluyong City on Monday night, waving the flag of the Philippines as passing cars sounded their horns. Marcos Jr thanked volunteers and political leaders 'that have cast their lot with us' in a late-night video message, but he stopped short of claiming victory. 'Let's wait until it's very clear, until the count reaches 100%, then we can celebrate,' he said. 'I hope you won't get tired of trusting us,' Marcos also told supporters in remarks streamed on Facebook. 'We have plenty of things to do,' he said, adding 'an endeavour as large as this does not involve one person.' Marcos Jr, 64, ran with the slogan 'Together we shall rise again', invoking nostalgia for his father's authoritarian regime, which the family and its supporters have portrayed as a golden era in a campaign fuelled by online disinformation as social media has been flooded with false stories that have swept aside the atrocities and corruption widespread during the period. Such portrayals have horrified survivors of Marcos Sr's brutal regime. Thousands of political opponents were tortured, arrested and disappeared under his rule, while as much as $10bn (PS8bn) was plundered. Marcos Sr was ousted in the People Power revolution in 1986, when the family was humiliatingly airlifted from the presidential palace by helicopter, and fled into exile. Ever since, say analysts, the Marcoses have sought to rebrand themselves and regain their place in politics. 'The disinformation infrastructure has been there for a long time. It's not as if it just sprouted during this campaign. The Marcoses' plan to reach the presidency has been in action for decades,' said Aries Arugay, a visiting fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, who is based in Manila. Marcos Jr had maintained a clear lead over his opponents in surveys conducted in the run-up to the vote, with Robredo second. A former human rights lawyer who has advocated for marginalised groups, she campaigned on a promise of good governance and an end to corruption. People began lining up to vote before polling centres opened at 6am local time (2300 BST) on Monday morning, and some waited more than four hours in the heat as malfunctioning voting machines caused delays. The vote followed three months of fierce campaigning, in which 2 million Robredo volunteers launched an unprecedented door-to-door campaign to try to win over voters and counter the onslaught of online disinformation. In the early hours of Tuesday morning, Robredo delivered a statement to her supporters, saying the voice of the people was 'getting clearer and clearer.' 'In the name of the Philippines, which I know you also love so dearly, we should hear this voice because in the end, we only have this one nation to share.' She told her supporters that a movement had been born, and said the fight for reforms would not end with the elections. 'Press for the truth. It took long for the structure of lies to be erected. We have the time and opportunity now to fight and dismantle this.' On Tuesday in Manila, crowds, many wearing black, gathered in front of the Comelec office, the Commission on Elections, protesting against the return of the Marcoses and alleging cheating. Marcos Jr's candidacy has polarised opinion, and some do not believe that the family has plundered state wealth, despite court rulings at home and abroad. At Santa Ana elementary school, in a residential area of Manila, which opened as a polling station, Raquel Deguzaman, 59, said she supported Marcos Jr and did not believe the family was corrupt. '[Marcos Sr] was able to help the Philippines. He's really good,' she said, adding that he had built infrastructure, including hospitals. Jack Drescher, 58, who was on his way to vote, also cited the building of infrastructure under Marcos Sr as a reason for backing his son. He was not concerned about corruption within the family, he said. 'He has a lot of gold so he won't steal any money,' he said, adding that he had heard this from YouTube. A myth claiming that the Marcoses own large stashes of gold has circulated online in various forms for years, including the claim that it will be given back to the people if the family is returned to power. Although Marcos Jr has denied the existence of any organised online campaign, he was the overwhelming beneficiary of false claims circulating on social media. The majority of disinformation was either designed to undermine Robredo's reputation or enhance the images of the Marcoses, according to analysis by the fact-checking coalition Tsek.ph, which monitored disinformation in the run-up to the election. Marcos Jr has avoided TV debates and challenging media interviews ahead of the election, and his campaign has been thin on policy detail. The idea that Marcos Sr's rule was a prosperous and peaceful era appeals to a generation of voters who did not live through Marcos Sr's martial law regime, including those who 'may harbour deep dissatisfaction with the non-inclusive development of the past 30 or so years,' said Ronald Mendoza, dean of Manila's Ateneo school of government. Cleo Anne A Calimbahin, an associate professor of political science at De La Salle University Manila, said the results should not come as a surprise but that they were sobering. They reflected in part a growing frustration among the public with previous administrations. 'I think this is a response of a public that saw the lack of progress made since 1986,' said Calimbahin, referencing the People Power revolution that put the Philippines on the road to democracy, a process that has not been linear. 'Unfortunately, the reforms agenda and its inability to deliver since 1986 has made people even wary of reformist candidates,' said Calimbahin.The election winner will take office on 30 June for a single six-year term.", "22c628ca7725390cdaaf395af9908da30f53ad6f28eb8914647c8eeb": "The Queen is to miss the state opening of parliament for only the third time in her reign. The 96-year-old monarch, who is experiencing mobility issues, will not read the Queen's speech on Tuesday, Buckingham Palace said. The Prince of Wales will read it on her behalf. As Charles takes on the head of state's major constitutional duty for the first time, the move - believed to be unprecedented in modern history - will be interpreted as a significant shift in his responsibilities as a king in waiting. The Queen's speech will be read by the prince after a new letters patent, authorised by the Queen, was issued that delegated the royal function of opening a new session of parliament to the counsellors of state. The Duke of Cambridge will also attend the state opening, as a counsellor of state. As opening parliament is a core constitutional responsibility of the monarch, the letters patent had to be issued to delegate that responsibility to two counsellors of state. There are currently four counsellors of state: Charles, William, Andrew and Harry. No other functions have been delegated by the Queen. The Duchess of Cornwall will also attend, although she is not a counsellor of state. The new arrangement will leave the main throne empty during the ceremony, as Charles and Camilla take their usual seats, with William on the opposite side to Camilla. The imperial state crown will still travel to parliament. In a statement, Buckingham Palace said: 'The Queen continues to experience episodic mobility problems, and in consultation with her doctors has reluctantly decided that she will not attend the state opening of parliament tomorrow.'  A No 10 spokesperson said: 'The prime minister fully respects the wishes of Her Majesty and is grateful to the Prince of Wales for agreeing to deliver the speech on her behalf.' The letters patent was issued to cover the state opening. In this instance, it enables Charles and William to jointly exercise that function. No other functions have been delegated by the Queen. The decision was taken on Monday. The mobility problems are said to be a continuation of those the Queen has experienced since the autumn. In order to prevent delay or difficulty in the dispatch of public business, the sovereign may issue a letter patent delegating specified 'royal functions' to counsellors of state, as provided for in section 6 of the Regency Act 1937.  Last week it was announced the Queen would not be attending this year's royal garden parties. The Queen is understood to have a busy diary at Windsor this week with a call with Australia on Monday, and a planned virtual privy council and phone audience with the prime minister on Wednesday. She is expected to undertake some private engagements later in the week. The Queen has opened every session of parliament since her accession in 1952, except in 1959 and 1963 when she was pregnant with Prince Andrew and Prince Edward respectively. On those two occasions, the sessions were opened by the lords commissioners, while the lord chancellor read the Queen's speech. Last week it was announced that the Queen would not attend any of this summer's garden parties at Buckingham Palace and at Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh. Constitutional expert Dr Bob Morris, of UCL's constitution unit, told the PA news agency that the arrangements, with both Charles and William attending and the prince reading the speech, were unprecedented. 'They've gone down the counsellor of state route - that's one way round it. The Prince of Wales is giving the speech and William is there as his stay and support, as it were,' he said. 'It's a rather odd confection, but it works.' He added: 'It is unprecedented and it's the way in which the constitution flexes to accommodate unusual circumstances. I can't think of any possible earlier version of this.'", "d97a66ac76d0d878c3f1d7fa81357d2ac70cb893b65031faa771725e": "The unrelenting slaughter of Mexican journalists has continued after two more newspeople were gunned down by unidentified assassins - taking the 2022 death toll to 11 in what is the deadliest country for media professionals outside a warzone. Yesenia Mollinedo Falconi and Sheila Johana Garcia Olivera were murdered in the town of Cosoleacaque, about 350 miles east of the capital Mexico City, around 3pm on Monday. According to reports, Mollinedo, the director of a weekly publication called El Veraz, and Garcia, a reporter, were shot inside their Ford Ikon outside a roadside convenience store. 'They have despicably and cowardly murdered a fellow reporter,' one local journalist announced in a video dispatch from the crime scene, as rifle-toting security forces surrounded the area. Mollinedo and Garcia are only the latest in a succession of Mexican reporters to lose their lives this year in what is a growing scandal that the president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has been accused of failing to adequately address. In fact, many critics believe Lopez Obrador, a media-bashing populist known as Amlo, is fuelling the violence with his incessant public attacks on journalists who he has labelled ill-intentioned conservative 'mercenaries' bent on undermining his nationalist administration. Attacks on the press have surged 85% in the three years since Amlo took power in December 2018 with every single Mexican state witnessing such incidents for the first time in 2021. Seven journalists were killed in the whole of last year, compared to 11 in the first five months of 2022. 'Every day [Amlo] urges society to discredit the journalistic profession - and clearly we are paying the price in blood,' said Sonia de Anda, a Tijuana-based journalist who recently confronted Mexico's president over the killings. Tijuana, which sits on the US border near San Diego, has suffered most this year, with two prominent journalists murdered outside their homes there since January: the photojournalist Margarito Martinez Esquivel and the television reporter Lourdes Maldonado. The government has blamed both killings on people linked to the Arellano-Felix crime cartel - but many are skeptical. 'Tijuana's got a pretty long history of grabbing someone who may have had the gun in their hand, but not touching the person who was actually responsible,' Michael Lettieri, a San Diego-based researcher and human rights activist told the San Diego Union-Tribune this week. Speaking earlier this year, Adela Navarro Bello, the director of the Tijuana weekly Zeta, said: 'Right now the Mexican press is caught in the crossfire between the threats and bullets of narco-traffickers and organized crime and the threats and verbal attacks and attempts to morally annihilate us from the federal and state governments.' 'When a journalist is murdered, it's not just the family that loses their loved one ... society loses too,' added Navarro Bello, whose publication has not put a reporter's name on an investigative story since 2006 for fear of them being shot dead. 'When a journalist is murdered society becomes a little bit blinder and a little bit more deaf.' The attorney general's office in Veracruz state, where Cosoleacaque is located, insisted Monday's murders would not go unpunished. 'All lines of inquiry will be pursued, including any connection to their journalistic activities,' it said on Twitter. However, campaigners say there is impunity in 90% of such crimes and see little sign of change. Griselda Triana, a journalist whose crime reporter husband, Javier Valdez Cardenas, was assassinated five years ago, was among dozens of demonstrators who hit the streets of Mexico City on Monday afternoon to protest the tsunami of murders. 'It is so easy for them to kill a journalist,' Triana lamented, remembering how her family had been shattered by his notorious 2017 shooting in Culiacan state. 'Sometimes they threaten them, sometimes the victim gets no warning at all and they just get rid of them. Justice either takes too long, or never comes at all.' 'It's a feeling of such helplessness,' said Pablo Perez, a Mexican producer for Al Jazeera who was also at the demonstration. 'Eleven [murders] is heartbreaking and the naturalness of knowing that before long there will be another killing is absurd.' Jordi Lebrija, a Tijuana journalist who was friends with Margarito Martinez, noted how nearly all of the journalists murdered this year were, like him, killed outside their homes. 'It's a message. Not even outside your house are you safe,' Lebrija said as he stood at the spot where Martinez had died. 'We are looking at you. We know who you are. We know what you do. That's the message for journalists.'", "73308f9f037f34831bdc203556c012ae0a14b6deffcfefe2b88f2452": "New Zealand has recorded more than 1m cases of Covid-19, after spending the first 18 months of the pandemic largely free of the virus.  The milestone reflects a stark change in New Zealand's pandemic experience, with more than 986,000 of those cases hitting in the months since the start of 2022. The country has had a huge spike in cases since Omicron breached the borders in December 2021, and the government loosened most restrictions in March.  Tuesday's official 1 million case milestone means at least 20% of the population has now been infected, but modellers said the true number of infections is likely three times higher. 'We know that the number of cases that we're seeing are just a fraction of the true number of infections that are happening,' said Dr Dion O'Neale of Covid Modelling Aotearoa, based at the University of Auckland. O'Neale said modellers' best estimates were that official case numbers recorded around a third of actual infections - meaning that New Zealand would have now had about 3m infections. Cases were missed for a variety of reasons, he said: some were asymptomatic, some didn't report positive test results, some didn't have easy access to testing, and people reluctant to get vaccinated were also reluctant to test or report an infection. Despite the rise in cases, New Zealand's death rate has remained relatively low by international standards. The total number of publicly reported deaths with Covid-19 is now 876 for the entirety of the pandemic - that figure includes all those who die within 28 days of contracting the virus. Hong Kong, another Covid-elimination state, has recorded more than 9,300 deaths for its population of 7.48m. New Zealand's low death rate has been assisted by its high levels of vaccination - 95% of adults are double-vaccinated, and 70% have had an additional booster shot. Director-general of health Dr Ashley Bloomfield said: 'I would like to reiterate my thanks to everyone in New Zealand who has played their part to keep our case numbers and rates low when compared internationally, and for continuing to do their bit to follow public health advice and minimise the spread of Covid-19.' O'Neale said that not knowing true infection numbers could present challenges for New Zealand down the line - making it more difficult to predict subsequent waves, reinfection rates, or the burden of long Covid.", "436eabe1d4a779f7dbf6cdb7184ec2d1a085cb3d673f225fc7ee13b9": "The capture of a former Alabama jail official, along with a murder suspect she allegedly helped escape from custody, ended in tragedy on Monday when the jail official, Vicky White, fatally shot herself after a police chase. Vicky White, 56, was accused of fleeing with Casey White, 38. The pair spent more than a week on the run before law enforcement in Indiana caught up to them. Officials said the two fugitives were caught near Evansville, Indiana, after a car chase that ended in a crash. Casey White surrendered and Vicky White shot herself and was taken to a hospital where she later died, officials said.  Casey White remains in custody. 'We got a dangerous man off the street today. He is never going to see the light of day again. That is a good thing, for not just our community. That's a good thing for our country,' said Rick Singleton, the sheriff of Alabama's Lauderdale county. The pair had been the target of a nationwide manhunt since 29 April when Vicky White, the assistant director of corrections for the jail in Lauderdale County, allegedly helped engineer the escape of Casey White, who was awaiting trial in a capital murder case. Vicky White had told co-workers she was taking the prisoner from the jail for a mental health evaluation at the courthouse, but the two instead fled the area. In Indiana, the Vanderburgh county Sheriff, Dave Wedding, said officials had learned that their vehicle was near the sheriff's office. As officers arrived, Casey and Vicky White fled in the vehicle and led police on a pursuit, he said. US marshals collided with them 'to try to end the pursuit', he said. Casey White was injured, not too seriously, in the ensuing crash and Vicky White then shot herself, causing 'very serious' injuries, he said. Casey White was serving a 75-year prison sentence for attempted murder and other charges at the time of his escape. He was awaiting trial in the stabbing of a 58-year-old woman during a burglary in 2015. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. Vicky White's family members and co-workers said they were stunned by her involvement. Singleton had said that, in hindsight, it appeared the plan had been in the works for some time. Prisoners at the jail said the two had a special relationship and she gave Casey White better treatment than other inmates. She had recently sold her home and had communicated with Casey White when he was in a state prison. In the past several months, she bought a rifle and a shotgun and also was known to have a handgun, US marshal Marty Keely said. She sold her house for about half of market value and bought a 2007 orange Ford Edge that she stashed at a shopping center without license plates. 'This escape was obviously well-planned and calculated. A lot of preparation went into this. They had plenty of resources, had cash, had vehicles,' Singleton said. A warrant was issued on 2 May for Vicky Sue White, charging her with permitting or facilitating escape in the first degree. The pickup truck, a 2006 Ford F-150, was found on Monday in Evansville after US marshals received a tip on Sunday that the pickup was seen at a car wash in the town, the marshals service said. Surveillance photos showed a man who closely resembles Casey White exiting the vehicle at the car wash, officials said. Investigators believe the pickup truck was stolen in Tennessee and then driven about 175 miles to Evansville, a law enforcement official told the Associated Press. The official could not discuss details of the investigation publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.

Many, if not most, working women accept it as just part of the job. But taking one for the team could be holding all women back. A new book argues that 'non-promotable work' - the kind that is important to organisational functioning, but unlikely to be rewarded or even recognised - is the invisible hurdle to gender equality in the workplace, with women's time and energy being disproportionately expended on thankless tasks. 'It's not that women are do-gooders, who want to help out the group,' says Lise Vesterlund, an economics professor at the University of Pittsburgh. 'They're doing it because we're expecting them to.' Vesterlund and three friends wrote The No Club: Putting a Stop to Women's Dead-End Work after finding themselves overwhelmed in their own careers a decade ago. 'Initially it was about getting our own work lives under control,' she says. Over years of research they found that across the public and private sectors, and a wide range of roles, female employees were shouldering the burden of 'office housework' and low-value assignments, causing them to miss out on promotions and pay increases. 'We think this is a central part of why women are not advancing at similar rates to men,' says Vesterlund. From teachers to engineers, investment bankers to checkout clerks, 'there is not an industry, occupation or rank that we have looked at where we didn't see this being a problem'. Their analysis of employee hours at a large consultancy firm found that regardless of seniority, the median woman spent about 200 more hours on non-promotable work each year than the median man - equating to approximately one month's worth of dead-end tasks. For junior women, it seemed to come at the expense of meaningful work, with junior men spending about 250 more hours each year on high-value work such as with clients. Senior women, on the other hand, spent the same amount of time on promotable tasks as senior men - meaning they just worked more hours in total. The firm's executives were 'shocked' to learn of the size of the imbalance, says Vesterlund. 'The magnitude of this is just so much greater than what organisations expect, which is why we need to spread the word.' The reason for this imbalance is twofold, says Vesterlund: not only are women asked to do this work more often than men; when asked, they are more likely to say yes. 'Women feel guilty when they say no - because we expect them to say yes.' One experiment found that in a mixed-gender group, women were 48% more likely to volunteer to take on a task than men were. (Men volunteered more often when in a group without women.) This collective expectation has been internalised by managers and employees alike, derailing individual careers and entrenching inequality. Vesterlund's research found that employees with less productive assignments were paid less and found themselves unable to increase their pay through negotiation. 'Men are also more strategic in the non-promotable work that they do, selecting the tasks that will get them access and connections,' Vesterlund says. A 2021 report by McKinsey found women to be taking the lead on employee wellbeing and diversity, equity and inclusion - often without thanks, even as such initiatives were trumpeted through the pandemic. 'It is clearly seen as being critical work but it is not being rewarded or recognised,' says Vesterlund. In fact, company commitments to equal representation - such as on panels or committees - can pile the responsibility on to just a few individuals, says Vesterlund, with minority ethnic women in particular 'taxed' for their underrepresentation. One study of teaching staff at a US university in 2012 found academics of colour spent three more hours a week on non-promotable service tasks than their white counterparts, with one respondent noting: 'If you are one of two women in your department ... [you] go on a lot of dinners.' Combined with domestic responsibilities, not least caring for children and elderly relatives, this personal-pressure pileup is coalescing into a mental health crisis among working women. 'The risk ... remains very real,' warned the McKinsey report. But Vesterlund and her co-authors argue that until the problem of non-promotable work is tackled, inequalities will persist. The switch to hybrid working, often presented as increasing flexibility, could in fact worsen the problem by making women less visible. A Deloitte survey found that nearly 60% of those working remotely felt excluded from meetings, while 45% said they did not have enough exposure to leaders. Vesterlund says the solution is for employers and employees to reflect on how non-promotable tasks are allocated within their organisation so that it can be made fairer. Managers could assign tasks at random or by a rota, split them between multiple employees, or align them with existing responsibilities or skills. 'The solution is to change the way we distribute work: once we give men and women equal opportunities to get assignments, many things will fall into place,' says Vesterlund. In the meantime, the challenge is resisting the status quo. 'When women are expected to say yes, it can cause backlash when they say no,' says Vesterlund. Men can help to redress the balance by putting themselves forward for non-promotable tasks before a female colleague volunteers, or by taking some off her plate. Meanwhile, women can support each other to protect their time and boundaries, just as Vesterlund and her co-authors started doing a decade ago. Even so, she says: 'I continue to be shocked by how easy it is for some of my male colleagues to say no - and how hard it is for me.'", "07b5d0c843e2c164bb3d8cad3b9b774d71f4d4e52094f6a83794203e": "", "af0480d9f23ec7501d9c12356c68b72c5e71a9bafb83b28a5653be75": "", "6be38d691f82e6f1990b5e7aab9ae8ec8e4cc29323677ca864c3dc26": "In early February 1814, an elephant walked across the surface of the Thames near Blackfriars Bridge in London. The stunt was performed during the frost fair, when temperatures were so cold that for four days the top layers of the river froze solid. Londoners promptly held a festival, complete with what we might now call pop-up shops and a lot of unlicensed alcohol. Nobody could have known it at the time, but this was the last of the Thames frost fairs. They had taken place every few decades, at wildly irregular intervals, for several centuries. One of the most celebrated fairs took place during the Great Frost of 1683-84 and saw the birth of Chipperfield's Circus. But the river in central London has not frozen over since 1814. The frost fairs are perhaps the most emblematic consequences of the 'little ice age', a period of chilly weather that lasted for several centuries. But while Londoners partied on the ice, other communities faced crop failures and other threats. The story of the little ice age is one of societies forced to adapt to changing conditions or perish. It's also a long-standing mystery. Why did the climate cool and why did it stay that way for centuries? Thanks to decades of studies, we are finally closing in on an explanation. The emerging story involves volcanoes, the oceans, possibly the sun and possibly also genocide. Like most things in science, the little ice age was discovered slowly and piecemeal. 'This all came about because there were lots of documentary records from around Europe, stating that there were some really cold winters,' says climatologist Paola Moffa-Sanchez of Durham University. These were reflected in records of grain prices, which rose because of crop failures and ships' logs saying Greenland was surrounded by sea ice and unreachable. The term 'little ice age' was coined by a Dutch-born geologist named Francois Matthes, who in a 1939 report noted that glaciers in the Sierra Nevada in California had regrown at some point within the last few millennia. The term stuck, but it took decades to narrow down the timeframe. This was done by British climatologist Hubert Lamb, who went on to found the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia. In a study published in 1965, Lamb used European temperature records going back many centuries to identify a 'notably warm climate... around AD1000-1200' that was 'followed by a decline of temperature levels till between 1500 and 1700 the coldest phase since the last ice age occurred'. This chilly period was 'undoubtedly upsetting for the human economies of those times (and perhaps of any time)' [his italics]. Since then, climatologists have tried to specify the duration and extent of the little ice age, but this has proved difficult. Most of the records showing the cooling are from Europe and records from elsewhere do not always show it. 'It's not a global phenomenon, in that it wasn't cool everywhere,' says Alexander Koch at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada. In some places, such as China, the period was marked by a wetter but not cooler climate. What's more, 'the cooling was not continuous', says Dagomar Degroot of Georgetown University in Washington DC. 'It came in waves... that reached different places at different times at different magnitudes.' For this reason, the start and end of the little ice age are a little vague. 'The classical definition is between 1400 and 1850,' says Moffa-Sanchez. However, 'some people say 1300 to 1850', pushing the start date back significantly. There is broad agreement that the period 1400-1800 is within the little ice age, she says, but outside that it's fuzzy. Either way, the 1814 frost fair was near the end of the period. Furthermore, the little ice age was not technically an ice age. These are periods in which Earth has permanent ice at both poles and we have been in one for more than 2.5m years. Within that period, the ice sheets have repeatedly waxed and waned. The most recent ice advance, which we colloquially call the ice age but is really a glacial period, occurred from about 115,000 to  11,700 years ago. Since then, we have been in a relatively warm period called the Holocene. In that context, the little ice age is minor. 'We're talking about several 10ths of a degree C,' says Degroot. In contrast, the coldest portion of the last glacial period is thought to have been about 6C cooler than the past 4,000 years. Still, Degroot says, even this small change mattered. 'On a regional or local scale, the anomalies could be really quite extreme,' he says, and documentary evidence shows that 'at least some people were aware that they were living in an anomalous kind of climate'. What was going on? The story isn't entirely settled, but researchers are increasingly confident about the initial trigger: volcanoes. 'You have these eruptions that are happening in clusters,' says Degroot. A 2015 study used data from ice cores to identify 25 major eruptions from the past 2,500 years. Between 1200 and 1400, there were huge eruptions of the Samalas volcano in Indonesia, Quilotoa in Ecuador and El Chichon in Mexico. Big eruptions blast sulphate aerosols into the stratosphere, the layer of the atmosphere above the weather. These aerosols reflect some of the sun's rays back into space, cooling the Earth. In recent times, the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Phillippines triggered up to 0.5C of surface cooling. Usually, an eruption only cools the climate for a few years. 'But if you have big eruptions in clusters, that can set off positive feedbacks in the climate system,' says Degroot. For example, several years of cooler temperatures cause sea ice to expand. Sea ice is white, so compared with dark blue water it reflects more radiation back into space. 'That can prolong and exacerbate the cooling,' he adds. There can also be knock-on effects in the ocean, says Moffa-Sanchez. If the winds change, huge rafts of sea ice can be carried south from Greenland into the Labrador Sea. There, they interfere with the huge Atlantic currents that carry warm water from the tropics towards Europe. This is a complex story, in which the slight initial cooling from the volcanoes triggers changes in the Earth system that lead to more and lasting cooling. But it seems to hold true. A 2018 modelling study found that it was not possible to explain the little ice age without invoking volcanic eruptions, although that did not mean other factors were not also at work. Another possible factor is the sun. The amount of energy it pumps out varies ever so slightly, most famously over the 11-year solar cycle during which activity varies from a maximum to a minimum and back again. The effects on Earth are so small they're hard to detect, but the sun sometimes has more of an impact. Several times in the past 1,000 years, our star has entered a 'grand minimum', in which it spends several decades being less active. The most recent was the Dalton Minimum between 1790 and 1820. This was preceded by the Maunder Minimum of 1645-1715. Before that, there is thought to have been the Sporer Minimum between about 1460 and 1550 and the Wolf Minimum around 1280-1350. Such grand minima can cool the planet, though by no more than 0.3C and probably less. Grand minima probably played a role in some of the chilliest episodes, says Moffa-Sanchez. In her studies of the period, 'cold centuries coincided with these really famous solar minima.' She has found evidence that grand minima affect wind patterns, with knock-on effects for ocean currents and heat distribution. However, it seems unlikely that grand minima alone caused the little ice age. The timings don't fit and, in any case, the climate impacts of grand minima are much smaller than those of massive eruptions. It may be that a solar maximum in the late 1300s also played a role. A study published in December 2021 found that this shifted wind patterns, interfering with the crucial Atlantic warm water current. The key point is - this isn't an either-or debate, says Moffa-Sanchez. 'It's a likely combination of all of them.' Numerous causes helps explain why the climate shifts came in waves, rather than there being one abrupt change to a lasting cooler state. 'It was not that you had this little ice age period where it was always cold,' says Moffa-Sanchez. 'You just had several cold centuries throughout this four-century-long period.' However, one big puzzle remains. The coldest period of the little ice age was around 1610 and it doesn't coincide with a grand minimum. Nor was there a particularly big eruption: Peru's Huaynaputina went off in 1600, but while the blast was large it wasn't exceptional. Instead, the suggestion is that this cold spell was caused by humanity - in a truly horrible way. In 1492, Christopher Columbus reached the Americas. Over the following decades, Europeans began colonising them. In the process, they fought with Indigenous Americans, often killing them. But even more lethally, they brought diseases. One of the worst was smallpox, which killed millions. As well as being a genocide and a tragedy, this may have had an impact on the climate. Many Indigenous Americans were farmers who had cleared forests for their crops and when they died the trees grew back, drawing carbon dioxide out of the air and cooling the planet. This scenario was first outlined by climatologist William Ruddiman in 2003, as part of his 'early Anthropocene' hypothesis that humans have been affecting Earth's climate for millennia, albeit less than we are today. The idea that mass deaths among Indigenous Americans led to climate cooling has received tentative support from modelling studies. Still, it has been controversial because there are so many uncertainties about the key numbers. However, in 2019 Koch and his colleagues published an updated analysis. They went through the argument step by step and tried to quantify everything, from the number of people who died to the extent of reforestation. They concluded that the European arrival led to 56m deaths by 1600. This dreadful toll meant trees grew again on 56m hectares of land, removing 27.4bn bn kilograms of carbon dioxide from the air.  'It's a really interesting theory,' says Degroot. However, he remains sceptical because we don't know how land use was changing in other parts of the world, especially Africa. While the question of whether human society contributed to the little ice agee remains up for discussion, what's clear is that the little ice age affected human society. For example, Norse settlers made their home in Greenland in 985 and stayed for centuries, only abandoning it in the early 1400s. It has often been suggested that the little ice age played a role in that. However, a study published in March looked at sediments from the region and found no sign of cooling, but it did find a drying trend, which would have meant less grass to feed livestock. Such stories may be true, but it's crucial to remember that people were not passive victims, says Degroot. 'You don't just see people who are completely at the whim of changing climatic conditions, you see people changing adaptively.' Degroot points to the Arctic, where there was often remarkable activity despite the increase in sea ice. Between 1611 and 1619, European whalers operated off the shores of Svalbard, because there was a shortage of vegetable oil and whale oil was a substitute. For the Dutch Republic, the period between 1560 and 1720 was something of a golden age, despite or even because of the cold winters. It did not depend on home-grown agriculture, so local crop failures were less of a problem, says Degroot. Instead, the republic's economy was driven by merchant ships, whose operators devised ingenious ways to cope with the cold - and the Dutch thrived while their neighbours struggled. 'It so rarely is what you'd expect,' says Degroot. Studying how past societies responded to climatic shifts such as the little ice age will help us all, as the climate crisis becomes ever more intense. 'Hopefully, we can learn from them, figure out what they did right, what they did wrong.' We had better learn fast, because the little ice age was just a taster. Back then, the average global temperature cooled by a fraction of a degree, but we've already warmed it by 1.1C, and are set to blow past 1.5C in the next few decades.", "cd17463f331c0a85a8aa5d507e24dd8d6eb511010e832db748c15601": "", "8348841af888ae9b42b243a8d88411bb68a7a4d93b84793d07a5abc5": "", "8f6185930aa1aa52f9323bed257879dae15333dc5d250678926d6ab4": "", "e648dafae11a4a40488b5dba219ac42e8d50fe3814f60f7a6174159a": "", "caddc317ee0a8f3da2455349e07a846229a3199fc852a895212ba993": "", "63a19f171e9c5cfa474ef753739ddf3bf07d8b6a1657601f272846d8": "", "66a82b4442043680384b0f7b2c955b8dfa5ba2f00d3069ab847405c6": "", "f38979e0740ef208a662ab16de61dac5bfc75489730240965aa7d2e4": "", "a808c93374b72809c0429f255152f81ae37b43eea7a56e57fba33d3c": "", "b16df422044acef3ada577f02e328858fa0936a779d9746241e20a32": "", "fcdd77f071c4bed92561face3cb88080f37c7bcbb0c1b7b3002a625b": "", "5b422b00a8125e003d9760eb7c878b27f58a043131302b73a4b7fea8": "", "4f6dada71e3ea9027121e29a15c00c5119308fbf7b5be3152cdefa14": "", "112f727d7fca4d350533fd72c33a48afaed4253bdd75b7cbced96948": "", "ab8ee959bd5608e34ad77af8b29058356b1c3e1fb181ec0765be75e4": "The services listed on the billboard outside Rotondaro Costruzioni, an estate agency and builder, are written in Italian and Russian, as are the details of the properties advertised for sale in the window display. Inside, about a dozen thick red folders, filled with plastic envelopes containing details of customers dating back to 2010, spill out of a cabinet. The majority of those property buyers were Russian. A short distance away is a stretch of Italy's southern Calabrian coastline lapped by clear-blue sea. This is not the glitzy Costa Smeralda in Sardinia or Tuscany's Forte dei Marmi, where lavish villas and yachts belonging to Russian oligarchs have been seized over the last two months, but Scalea, a low-profile holiday resort with a medieval hilltop village whose economy has flourished over the past decade, partly thanks to the ordinary Russians who flocked here for the cheap property and sunshine. Nicola Rotondaro, the company's owner, is finalising the sale of another property, a one-bedroom apartment worth EUR22,000 (PS19,000), to a young Russian-Ukrainian man living near Naples. He is not in good spirits, however. The presence of Russian buyers and holidaymakers in Scalea had already all but evaporated as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and the unauthorised status of the Russian Sputnik vaccine in the EU. Now the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and subsequent economic sanctions, especially a ban on flights, means the Russians are unlikely to return for the foreseeable future. 'We are already at zero,' said Rotondaro. 'The Russians don't come any more; they've been cut off.' Rotondaro is not the only one feeling the pinch. Scalea, a town of just under 11,000 residents, has about 30 property agencies, many catering to the Russian market. Restaurants, bars and shops had come to depend on their Russian guests, who tend to spend more than their Italian counterparts while elongating the holiday season by visiting outside the hot summer months. La Playa, a spacious bar and restaurant, has menus in Russian and Russian-speaking staff, but when the Guardian visited at lunchtime on a recent national holiday, there were few diners. 'In normal situations, there are lots of Russians here. Now there is not even one,' said Salvatore, a waiter. 'And they spend a lot. If the war ends soon, maybe they'll return in time for the summer.' Property-building boomed in Scalea, and other towns along Calabria's coastline, in the 1980s, driven by demand for holiday homes from Italian buyers, mostly from Naples. 'You could count the number of foreigners on one hand,' said Tony Hackett, a British-Italian property agent. 'But then people who bought during that period stopped coming, and so a lot of property has been recycled.' Interest from Russians started to gather pace from about 2010. They were schoolteachers, professors and doctors, snapping up humble properties that even today can be bought for as little as EUR14,000. The most famous Russian property owner in Scalea was Boris Klyuyev, an actor who died in 2020. Some of the property owners have settled in the town, including Maria Stepura, the president of the Calabria-Russia association, which helps to promote Calabria in Russia and assists property buyers with Italian bureaucracy. Stepura bought a home close to the beach in 2010. 'The value of the rouble at the time meant it cost much less than buying land near Moscow,' she said. Buyers with enough savings would purchase a property outright; others would obtain loans from Russian banks. 'Life here is simple: you have a beautiful beach, the cost of living is cheap, you can eat out cheaply and have breakfast at the bar, which is always a pleasure, and the locals are welcoming,' Stepura said. Scalea has been described by the local press as 'a little Moscow in Calabria', but Giacomo Perrotta, the mayor since August 2020, begs to differ. 'Yes, there has been significant investment from Russia - obviously Scalea is different from Moscow for those who like the sun,' he said. 'But we also have other communities - Polish, Romanian, and Ukrainian. Recently we held a march for peace, and everyone participated, Russians and Ukrainians. As a population, we are well integrated.' The property boom in areas of Calabria was partly fuelled by illegal building by mafia groups, with a crackdown since 2013 leading to the seizure of hundreds of tourist resorts and holiday homes. Some foreign investors became unwittingly entangled in the mafia's real-estate crimes. Scalea has not been left unscathed, and now the local administration is hoping to put properties confiscated from the mafia on to the market. 'We're participating in a competition for funding, so that is the first step - to have the funds to tidy them up,' said Perrotta. It remains to be seen if Russians will return to buy the additional property stock, but Perrotta is confident that Scalea is in for a busy summer. 'We will wait for the Russians to come back ... but after two years of the pandemic, we anticipate a boom in tourist presence - we don't only live off Russians; we have plenty of Italian visitors too.'", "e54fc8fae355ec80bce8f4dcd0b8fb114f0ef6dfcac3a3259eefb99d": "", "9696edfb68460672c581f9688d5f395254444babdc51f2a5cdc1426b": "The peat sods lay spread on a field, at the end of which was a mound of earth the colour of dark chocolate. It was the edge of a bog, a habitat thousands of years in the making. A mechanised cutter with steel claws had gouged and sliced some of it into chunks that now covered an area the size of a football pitch. Enough, once dried and bagged, to heat a house for an Irish winter. Some environmentalists would consider this tableau in County Kildare - one replicated across rural Ireland at this time of year - akin to a crime scene, a mad, destructive assault on a precious natural resource, turning a carbon sink into a smoky fuel. Ned Phillips, 49, who did the gouging, disagreed. 'I'll not stop cutting turf here no matter what law they pass. It's our tradition. We're doing no harm here.' It was his mother's dying wish that he continue a tradition dating back centuries, a wish he intends to honour, even though the family's patch of bog is now part of a conservation area. 'I'll fight till my death.' Fiona Conlon, a fellow turf cutter, appealed for understanding. 'People think we're being thugs or radicals. We're not heathens. It's pride. We believe in what we do. My home feels like home because of the turf fire. The warmth and the glow - that's a real sense of comfort.' Ireland's government, in contrast, is feeling a scorching burn. An attempt to curb the sale and distribution of turf, also known as peat, has backfired, triggering uproar in parliament, splitting the ruling coalition and fuelling a narrative of urban elites versus rural poor. Eamon Ryan, the Green party leader and environment minister, has been forced into a partial retreat. The taoiseach, Micheal Martin, said there would be no ban on turf sales this year. In policy terms curbing the commercial cutting and burning of turf was supposed to be 'low hanging fruit', an overdue crackdown on a practice harmful to health and the environment. Instead, it turned into a cautionary tale about populism, energy prices, Vladimir Putin and just transition to a green economy, a combustible nexus that is playing out across much of Europe. Soggy peatlands formed by the accumulation of decayed vegetation cover much of Ireland's midlands. Lacking coal and woods, not to mention electricity, Irish people survived for centuries by draining bogs and using peat as fuel. Storytelling by a blazing hearth embodied the national identity. From the 1930s a semi-state company, Bord na Mona, extracted peat on an industrial scale, a source of patriotic pride. In the 1990s attitudes began to change. Fuel peat is more damaging than coal, generating less energy when burned while producing higher carbon emissions. Burning smoky fuels was banned in Dublin to reduce winter smog, though has been allowed to continue in many smaller towns and rural areas. In 2018 Bord na Mona announced it was closing 17 of its 'active bogs' and would close the remaining 45 to commercial harvesting within seven years. Families, thought to number several thousand, that live near the remaining bogs are still allowed to cut turf for domestic use in accordance with traditional 'turbary rights'. Commercial contractors with mechanical equipment do the cutting for many such families and sell the surplus with little or no regulation or taxation. About 100,000 households, many in old, draughty dwellings, use turf for heating, according to some estimates. Every hectare of drained peatland emits two tonnes of carbon per annum. Peat, along with imported coal and other smoky fuels, is also blamed for air pollution that kills 1,300 people each year. Successive governments have tried and failed to rein in commercial turf operators. 'It's a real political failure to tackle a very stinging nettle,' said Seamus Boland, head of Irish Rural Link, an advocacy group for disadvantaged areas. One reason is cultural. 'There is a lot of emotional attachment to turf burning,' said John Sweeney, a climate expert and geography professor at Maynooth University. 'The idea that you can't have a home without a blazing hearth is something we have to get over in Ireland. We have to recognise the damage far exceeds the emotional benefits.' The other reason is financial. Contractors risk losing livelihoods. Families that heat homes with peat fear retrofitting, with costs of thousands of euros, and a switch to much pricier alternative energy sources. 'I don't want to destroy the whole world but I don't want to be poor either,' said John Dore, 62, who lives by the country's largest raised bog, the Bog of Allen in County Kildare. Soaring global energy costs and uncertainty over Russia's oil and gas exports to western Europe have strengthened the conviction of Dore, a spokesperson for the Kildare Turf Cutters Association, to keep burning turf. 'I never felt so happy to have a shed full of turf. I don't care what Putin does with his gas, we're independent.' Other turf advocates also feel emboldened. 'We are a small country at the end of a very small line when it comes to gas or diesel. When we have a fuel source of our own now is not the time to attack it. Jesus, it doesn't make sense at all,' said Michael Fitzmaurice, an independent member of the Dail (Ireland's lower house of parliament) and chair of the Turf Cutters and Contractors Association. There is consensus in Ireland that the climate crisis is real - deniers get no traction. Nor do populists, as a rule. However, the battle over turf has exposed rural grievances that echo supporters of anti-establishment politicians in Britain, the continent and the US. For Ryan, the environment minister, turf should have been just a skirmish on the way to bigger battles over farming, transport and renewable energy that will determine Ireland's struggling climate action plan. He targeted commercial contractors, not households, who retained the right to cut and share turf. Yet the Dail erupted, with independent rural deputies and the main opposition party, Sinn Fein, accusing the government of violating traditional rights and condemning people to fuel poverty. Ryan's coalition partners also turned on him. Leo Varadkar, the Fine Gael leader and tanaiste, or deputy prime minister, said removing turf cutting from rural Ireland was like removing pasta from Italians or wine from the French. The comment drew widespread criticism. 'The production of wine and pasta doesn't kill people. It's a very misleading analogy,' said Sweeney, the climate expert. 'The debate has been twisted,' said Tristram Whyte, of the Irish Peatland Conservation Council. He said contractors and some politicians were muddying things by suggesting grandmothers could be arrested for burning a bit of peat. Florence Renou-Wilson, a research scientist and peatland expert at University College Dublin, said the science was clear. Bogs, when left intact, benefited the climate, biodiversity and human health. Peat extraction 'bled out' bogs, degrading air and water quality and emitting carbon. 'It has all these bad local and global effects. It's not rocket science; people have understood this is a precious resource for their community.' The state should pay turf cutters to restore bogs and fund retrofitting of homes that rely on turf for heating, said Renou-Wilson. 'This is a resource that has been mismanaged. We need to get our act together.' Boland, the head of Irish Rural Link, agreed. 'The only way to stop turf burning is to provide a way for households to change their systems.' There is a government scheme to retrofit 500,000 homes by 2030, with an additional scheme for households in energy poverty, but delays have created a backlog. There is another obstacle. Many turf cutters eye authority with suspicion. Just as storytellers of old chronicled resistance to landlords and redcoats, today's turf cutters weave their own story. Previous governments have sought to take control of bogs with compulsory purchase orders and compensation schemes, only to break their promises, they claim. Some openly cut turf in special areas of conservation despite aerial surveillance and regular warning letters to desist. 'I'm not worried about it but it's threat after threat after threat - your head is just so fried with it,' said Colm Higgins, 56, a plasterer who cuts in Mouds Bog, a protected part of the Bog of Allen. 'It's the wildlife crowd flexing their muscles and hoping we'll go away. We're not going away.' His partner, Fiona Conlon, an IT tutor, said Irish governments had surrendered the sugar beet industry, fishing rights and other assets to European diktats. 'Now it's turf. We're being left with nothing. It's like they don't want you to own anything or have a sense of independence.' It wasn't about heating or even money, it was about identity, said Conlon. People helped one another cut turf, competed for the best sods, had some craic - it was a way of life, she said. 'It's part of our heritage. I love the bog. You're out in the fresh air getting exercise, you're with your neighbours. It's your own tradition and pride and I feel that's being robbed from us. I have forefathers and foremothers that fought for this country. We're not going to roll over.'", "efa3d794a6a3e8568ea69a631180b48251d1a281f3c00effa682b533": "The debate over whether Britain should introduce a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas companies has been reignited by bumper profits at BP. The one-off levy is among a suite of measures that have been proposed to tackle the energy crisis, which has sent household bills soaring. The war in Ukraine has exacerbated existing supply problems and left governments across Europe scrambling to protect consumers from the cost of living crunch. The Centre for Economics and Business Research has estimated that, without government intervention, energy costs could increase by 40% across the eurozone in 2022, up from a 13% rise in 2021. Deliberations over sanctions on Russian energy supplies and measures to limit the fallout of the conflict continue in Europe. In the UK, analysts have said bills could reach as much as PS3,000 a year in October, when the price cap is due to go up again, if wholesale gas prices do not fall. Here is how different governments across Europe have reacted. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has been repeatedly criticised for acting slowly on tackling the energy crisis. The government has so far resisted calls from Labour and the Liberal Democrats to introduce a windfall tax on the profits of North Sea oil and gas operators, arguing that it would discourage investment in domestic energy supplies. In February, Sunak said 28m households will receive a PS200 discount on their bills from October. The cost will be recovered over the next five years. Ministers rejected calls for a cut on the 5% VAT rate on energy bills in favour of a one-off rebate of PS150 for households in England in council tax bands A-D. A further PS144m has been set aside to support vulnerable people and those on low incomes. The Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, on Monday laid out a EUR14bn (PS11.8bn) support package to tackle energy costs. His measures include subsidies for vulnerable families and a EUR200 cash payment for pensioners and those on low incomes. Draghi also found extra funds for local governments and will offer tax credits for energy-intensive industries. The measures come on top of the EUR20bn the cash-strapped nation has already spent on cushioning the impact of the energy price rise. The initiatives will be funded by a hike in Italy's windfall tax, introduced in January. The levy on energy industry profits will rise to 25% from 10%. Economists have warned that a sudden halt to Russian gas would trigger a 'sharp recession' in Germany. The chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has promised 'tangible relief' to citizens and last week unveiled a EUR30bn collection of measures. These include a temporary reduction in fuel taxes and cheaper, 90-day tickets to make public transport more affordable. The move builds on an existing EUR15bn relief package which involved an increase in the tax-free allowance for long-distance commuters. Berlin has also fast-tracked a revamp of legislation from 1975 aimed at handling energy shocks. The reworked bill will include measures to shut down companies during a gas shortage and strengthen EU security of supply regulations. Rules brought in five years ago state that EU members must help one another when gas supplies are tight. Spain's government was one of the first to take action to protect households against a sharp rise in energy bills. It agreed last September to remove taxes from home energy bills, which would instead be paid by enforcing a windfall tax on companies profiting from the surge in energy prices. A string of other measures have followed, including a ban on increasing gas bills by more than 5% for customers with lower energy consumption. Last week the European Commission agreed a price cap on gas for Spain and Portugal for 12 months. Consumers have been helped by a cut to VAT on energy bills and a reduction in a separate tax on electricity. Emmanuel Macron made energy policy a key pillar in his successful presidential re-election campaign. He said he would make France 'the first major nation to abandon gas, oil and coal' ahead of his win last month. In the short term, the French government has forced majority state-owned electricity supplier EDF Energy to lower costs. The operator, which is behind the Hinkley Point B nuclear power plant in the UK, told investors it would take a EUR8.4bn hit from the energy price cap, which meant it lowered the cost of electricity below the market rate. Electricity taxes have been reduced for households and businesses. The French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has estimated government efforts to curb costs since the Ukraine invasion are worth about EUR25bn. The Polish government has urged European counterparts to impose tough sanctions on Russia's oil and gas industry after gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland were cut last week by the Russian energy giant Gazprom. Both countries have said there is no immediate risk to supplies. Polish ministers have repeatedly intervened since late last year to protect households from the energy price hike. The prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, introduced an 'anti-inflation shield', cutting VAT on food and gas to 0%. A wider economic package, dubbed the 'anti-Putin shield', is being rolled out to support companies and jobs. The Dutch government was swift to act as the energy crisis began to escalate last year. Last October, energy taxes were cut for households and EUR150m was allocated to boosting home insulation. In March, the government raised a one-off energy allowance for low-income households by EUR600 to EUR800. The government has also lowered VAT on energy from 21% to 9% until the end of the year. Excise duties on petrol and diesel have been cut for the rest of 2022. In December, Norway's government set out a series of measures to help households totalling more than 8bn kroner (PS664m). Last month its parliament agreed an extension to a support scheme to tackle high electricity prices, worth EUR850m through to March 2023. Support for students and widows has also been ramped up. Sweden began introducing policies to tackle the energy crisis at the start of the year. These extended to compensation for households with high energy usage and fuel duty cuts. The government has also offered EUR6,700 in support for buying electric vehicles. Sweden is also expected to spend EUR48m on a housing allowance for families with children.", "291dd1a47a0cbf5303c01e2046e6c28cd4a3b8638ef9ccfaa73e169e": "In February 2022, a Dutch-owned fishing trawler released a silvery stream of 100,000 dead fish, which carpeted several thousand square metres of ocean off the coast of France. The vessel's owners blamed the discharge on a faulty net. Environmental groups alleged that the fish were intentionally dumped. Whatever the truth, that spectacle of squandered sea life was the tip of the iceberg: figures from WWF show that in 2019, at least 230,000 tonnes of fish were dumped in EU waters. Most of the waste - 92% - is related to bottom-trawling, a fishing method that scrapes the seafloor, indiscriminately scooping up everything in its path. But this figure is a small fraction of an even larger global issue. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that 35% of all fish, crustaceans and molluscs harvested from oceans, lakes and fish farms are wasted or lost before they ever reach a plate. Fish are highly perishable and fragile, which makes them more vulnerable to waste, a problem that is compounded by haemorrhaging fish at every step of the supply chain. Fish waste is especially shocking, says Pete Pearson, senior director for food waste at WWF, because they 'are wild animals, so we are harvesting wildlife'. Fish populations are already threatened by overfishing, pollution, and the climate crisis. With current rates of fish consumption projected to double by 2050, waste is increasingly on the radar of regulators. 'We have to do something about it,' says Omar Penarubia, a fisheries officer at the FAO. That begins, experts say, with understanding exactly what is driving waste between harvest and plate. The task is made difficult by fisheries' notoriously opaque supply chains, and incomplete datasets that are also inconsistent, although the evidence is clear that most fish waste starts at the point of extraction. Just under half of all fish consumed by people is wild-caught at sea. 'There's such abundance that we've grown to be OK with certain loss rates,' Pearson says, although noting that 34% of global marine stocks are now overfished. Bycatch (unintentionally caught, unwanted fish) is a growing problem, too: roughly 10% of wild-caught fish are discarded worldwide each year, representing 8.6m tonnes of animals. The main culprits are imprecise fishing gear and policies that allow fishers to discard non-target species. There's an economic driver, too. 'I think there is a strong connection between subsidies and waste in the water,' says Rashid Sumaila, professor of ocean and fisheries economics at the University of British Columbia. Although subsidies were historically devised to support small-scale fishers, today 80% of $35.4bn (PS26.4bn) in annual fishing subsidies goes to a handful of industrial fleets, Sumaila's research shows. These include gargantuan bottom trawlers that are uniquely equipped to travel out to the high seas and overfish, leading to discards on an industrial scale. The impact of illegal and unreported fishing is also important, says Sumaila, as it is likely contributing tonnes more bycatch to global fish waste. Fish waste is about more than just the physical loss of fish: for the 3 billion people whose diets depend on fish, it is a lost nutritional opportunity. 'The narrative is that we have to produce more to feed the growing masses, but the greatest pathway to [increasing] supply is reducing loss and waste,' says Shakuntala Thilsted, global lead for nutrition and public health at World Fish and winner of the 2021 World Food Prize. Many see controlled aquaculture systems (or 'fish farms') - which generate more than half our fish supply - as a solution to the waste of wild fishing. But Dave Love, senior scientist at the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future, says that various factors, such as disease, are driving considerable losses on farms, too. 'Mortality in fish ponds is actually a significant source of lost potential food,' Love says. Fish waste continues after harvest - though how it unfolds differs depending on location. The FAO estimates that 27% of all fish globally is lost or wasted after landing, but in low-income countries the fish is more likely to be unintentionally lost than wasted, says Penarubia. One study showed that in Ghana, Burkina Faso and Togo, 65% of lost fish on land was attributable to poor handling, lack of storage and cooling facilities on fishing vessels and along the lengthy supply chain.  Fish disappear after distribution, too, but here the culprits are retailers and consumers, almost exclusively in middle-and high-income countries. In North America, Oceania and Europe, fish waste at consumption far outstrips that of any other region in the world. Pearson thinks retailers in the US partly contribute to the problem by prioritising large, fresh fish to sell at a premium, which quickly spoil. 'This is the real tragedy, because it's moved all the way through the supply chain, and then we're comfortable with a 10% to 30% loss rate in the grocery store,' he says. When retailers prioritise fresh fish, 'the ripple effect is that consumers are more likely to waste that in their homes,' says Love, who published research showing that retailers were responsible for about 16% of wasted seafood in the US, while up to 63% comes down to consumers putting uneaten fish in the bin. Solutions do exist to reduce fish spoilage along the supply chain. Increasing access to cold-chain technologies in low-income countries, along with methods such as solar-powered drying tents, could extend the shelf life of fish. Fishers and processors also need training on better fish handling and storage to limit loss, Penarubia says. At the consumer end, Pearson and Love argue that we should encourage more people to opt for frozen fish, which could reduce demand for fresh fish in grocery stores, and limit the amount that is lost in retail and people's homes. Thilsted suggests diversifying our appetites beyond the ubiquitous fish fillet to smaller fish and bivalves, which can be consumed whole to reduce waste. 'If our notion of 'fish' is a fillet on a pan, then we are already far down the path of loss and waste, because we have reduced the edible part to such a small portion of the whole.' Existing fish byproducts can be captured and turned into new ones. Fish heads, fins, and bones from the fishing industry are already a source of fertiliser and feed; now innovators are finding uses for everything from fish skin for burn treatments, and crustacean waste to make biodegradable packaging. 'The idea of full utilisation is something that needs to be pervasive across all food supply chains' says Pearson, who cautions, however, that we shouldn't overstate these solutions. Unless fish byproducts replace a share of fish demand, they are simply making use of waste - not reducing it at source. Ultimately, prevention is the best solution, starting at sea, where this problem begins, Pearson says. Fishers need to be equipped with more selective gear for fishing, and aided by policies that discourage discards. Sumaila underscores the need for 'good subsidies' that can be channelled towards fisheries that help replenish wild stocks: 'We need to spend taxpayers' money in ways that reinforce positive feedback from people to nature, and nature to people,' he says. For generations we've believed 'the ocean is huge, and we can just take whatever we want,' says Pearson. 'Now we're coming to see the limits of that. And when you have limits, it requires you to become more efficient.'", "0e3c2945ffec7c2745101236cf567c39f45572322db688178bce1119": "It has already been a very wet autumn in eastern Australia. Now further heavy rain will bring the potential for flooding in the north-east of the country over the next few days. La Nina has been the main driver behind the wet weather across Australia during what is autumn in the southern hemisphere. During a La Nina event, the sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific are colder than normal, meaning that the usual easterly winds across the equator are strengthened. The result of this is that more moisture is fed into north-eastern parts of Australia in particular, with an increase in associated heavy rainfall events. This is what has been seen for much of the last couple of months in Australia, after Brisbane on the east coast broke its three-day and seven-day rainfall records back in the last week of February. Low pressure has and will continue to affect northern parts of Australia, with east or north-easterly winds feeding in from the Pacific, helping to seed heavy rain. Some parts of central Queensland recorded 100-150mm of rainfall on Monday. And the north-east coast between Townsville and Yeppoon could get 150-200mm quite widely in the 24 hours to 6am on Wednesday, with the potential locally for 200-300mm as the low pressure system moves eastwards out into the Pacific. This level of rainfall is likely to lead to widespread flooding in this area. This area of low pressure is expected to sink southwards down the east coast over the next few days and although the intensity of rain will ease, the system will bring some strong winds down the east coast with the potential for gusts to exceed 50mph. Meanwhile, the intense heatwave across India is expected to continue through the rest of this week with temperatures perhaps exceeding 50C in some northern areas. In stark contrast, farther east across China temperatures will remain well below average over the next few days. A persistent north-easterly wind will keep daytime maximum temperatures in the teens rather than the mid to high 20s celsius expected at this time of year.", "e475e5d56d8ba563e35f8e8dd3d5015dadfedc3d8e8c75945b5fd67a": "Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon surged to record levels for the month of April, nearly doubling the area of forest removed in that month last year - the previous April record - preliminary government data has shown, alarming environmental campaigners. In the first 29 days of April, deforestation in the region totalled 1,012.5 square km (390 square miles), according to data from national space research agency Inpe on Friday. The agency, which has compiled the monthly data series since 2015/2016, will report data for the final day of April next week. April is the third monthly record this year, after new highs were also observed in January and February. Destruction of the Brazilian Amazon in the first four months of the year also hit a record for the period of 1,954 square km (754 square miles), an increase of 69% compared to the same period of 2021, clearing an area more than double the size of New York City. Deforestation in the Amazon has soared since rightwing president Jair Bolsonaro took office in 2019 and weakened environmental protection. Bolsonaro argues that more farming and mining in the Amazon will reduce poverty in the region. 'The cause of this record has a first and last name: Jair Messias Bolsonaro,' said Marcio Astrini, head of Brazilian advocacy group Climate Observatory, in a statement. Bolsonaro's office directed questions to the ministries of environment and justice. The ministries said in a joint statement the government was making major efforts to fight environmental crimes and that police and environmental authorities were cooperating on an operation to combat deforestation in five Amazon states. Even with deforestation already on the rise, Climate Observatory said its analysts were astounded by such a high reading in April, which is part of the rainy season when the muddy forest is harder for loggers to access. Preservation of the Amazon is vital to stopping catastrophic climate change because of the vast amount of climate-warming carbon dioxide it absorbs. Ane Alencar, science director of the Amazon Environmental Research Institute , said she had expected deforestation to keep rising ahead of the October presidential election, like it has in Brazil's past three election years, as officials wary of angering voters generally do less to enforce the law. Still, she called the surge in deforestation last month 'absurd.' 'It seems that the clearing of forests has become institutionalised in the country as something common, with record after record,' Alencar said.", "bf84e94ea8c54219e03909276c67d326ac1011169722b5d1aaa29d12": "The British government approved payments of up to PS60m to a future king of Saudi Arabia, his son and other high-ranking officials as part of a huge arms deal and then sought to conceal them in what it described as a 'deniable fiddle', a trial has heard. Opening the defence of one of two men accused of corruption in the arms deal, Ian Winter QC told Southwark crown court that some of the payments were made to the then Prince Abdullah, who later became the Saudi monarch for a decade. Winter also told the court that internal documents recorded that the British government and Abdullah organised 'a deniable fiddle' to hide the payments. The QC also alleged that the British government ensured payments continued to be paid to high-ranking Saudis until 2020 - eight years after the Serious Fraud Office began an investigation into the same payments. Winter is representing Jeffrey Cook, 65, who, along with John Mason, 79, is being prosecuted by the SFO for authorising corrupt payments amounting to PS7.9m to senior Saudis between 2007 and 2012. The payments were made, according to the SFO, to ensure that a British firm, GPT, received lucrative contracts from the Saudi military. Cook, a former Ministry of Defence civil servant, was GPT's managing director. Mason worked for an offshore firm, Simec, that is accused of funnelling the bribes to the Saudis. The contracts awarded to GPT were part of a large arms deal managed as a formal agreement between the UK and Saudi governments that had started in the 1970s. Winter told the court the British government decided in 1978 that large payments had to be paid personally to Abdullah, then a prince, to ensure that the British won the original arms deal. This was a 'fundamental necessity without which the contract would not have been awarded to the British', he added. He said the British government 'decided that it was in the public interest, bearing in mind the value of the ... contract, to enter into a binding contractual agreement with Prince Abdullah' to be given the payments. He alleged that Abdullah and the MoD organised the original deal on the basis of what the MoD 'called at the time, 'the deniable fiddle'. They actually recorded that phrase in reports and file notes at the time.' Winter said 'both Prince Abdullah and the British government wanted a deniable fiddle that would enable the payments to be made, but which would permit them to deny their involvement through the use of a private contractor'. In recent years, the role of private contractor had been performed by GPT. He said 'very senior' officials in the British government approved every penny of the payments that were made as part of the arms deal in what at one stage was called 'top cover'. This included the money paid to Abdullah, and more recently his son Prince Miteb, and other high-ranking officials. Abdullah died in 2015 after 10 years on the Saudi throne. He alleged that the UK government facilitated the payments amounting to PS60m to be made from the late 1970s to 2020, when GPT's contracts ended. The SFO began its investigation into GPT in 2012 after complaints from whistleblowers. Winter told Mr Justice Bryan that 'even after the prosecution's balloon had gone up ... the MoD set about working on creating a new system that did not involve GPT having to make the' payments to senior Saudis. He alleged that the payments were moved through an offshore route by the MoD. He added that legally, the payments did not amount to corruption if the Saudi and British governments had authorised them.

The paper beat two other finalists: the New York Times, for challenging official accounts of US military engagements in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, for an expose of electrical fires in city rental operations. The Pulitzers, administered by Columbia University in New York and considered the most prestigious prizes in US journalism, recognise work in 15 journalism categories and seven arts categories. The winner of the public service award receives a gold medal. Winners of other categories get $15,000. A bipartisan Senate committee linked seven deaths to the assault on the Capitol, which happened after Trump told supporters to 'fight like hell' to overturn his election defeat by Joe Biden. The attack did not succeed in stopping certification of Biden's victory. Trump was impeached for inciting an insurrection. The impeachment was the most bipartisan ever but the former president was acquitted when enough Senate Republicans stayed loyal. Trump therefore remains free to run for the White House again. A House committee is preparing for public hearings in its investigation of the riot, which has produced a charge of criminal contempt of Congress against Steve Bannon, Trump's former chief strategist. Bannon has pleaded not guilty. More than 800 people have been charged over the Capitol attack, some, members of a far-right militia, with seditious conspiracy. Announcing the prize, the administrator of the Pulitzer prizes, Marjorie Miller, saluted the Post for its 'compellingly told and vividly presented account of the assault on Washington ... providing the public with a thorough understanding of one of the nation's darkest days'. Sally Buzzbee, executive editor of the Post, said: 'There is nothing more central to the American experiment than democracy ... in 2021, that democracy came under attack from within. 'The challenge for the fourth estate was clear: we were no longer just a watchdog of the institutions and elected leaders of our democracy, but an indispensable defender of democracy itself.' Buzzbee also saluted 'more than 100' of her journalists for 'fearless, consistent and comprehensive work ... read and watched by millions [and] cited in congressional investigations'. The intersection of health, safety and infrastructure played a prominent role among other winning projects. The Tampa Bay Times won the investigative reporting award for Poisoned, an in-depth look into a polluting lead factory. The paper's editor and vice-president, Mark Katches, said the win was 'a testament to the importance of a vital local newsroom like the Times'. The Miami Herald took the breaking news award for its work covering the deadly Surfside condo tower collapse, while the Better Government Association and the Chicago Tribune won the local reporting award for Deadly Fires, Broken Promises, an examination of a lack of enforcement of fire safety standards. The Miami Herald's executive editor, Monica Richardson, said: 'As a newsroom, we poured our hearts into the breaking news and the ongoing daily coverage, and subsequent investigative coverage, of the Champlain Towers South condominium collapse story. 'It was our story to tell because the people and the families in Surfside who were impacted by this unthinkable tragedy are a part of our community.' The Pulitzer prizes also awarded a special citation to journalists from Ukraine, acknowledging their 'courage, endurance and commitment' in covering the Russian invasion. Last August, the Pulitzer board granted a special citation to Afghan journalists who help produce news and images from their own war-torn country. In the arts categories, Joshua Cohen won the fiction prize with The Netanyahus: An Account of a Minor and Ultimately Even Negligible Episode in the History of a Very Famous Family. Inspired by the story of the former Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's father trying to get a job in academia, it won the 2021 National Jewish Book Award for Fiction. In the Guardian, Leo Robson called the novel 'utterly immersive'.

'At the risk of stating the obvious, unless something changes to cause the birthrate to exceed the death rate, Japan will eventually cease to exist. This would be a great loss for the world,' the Tesla chief executive, who recently agreed a deal to buy Twitter for $44bn (PS36bn), said in a post at the weekend. Musk, who has previously voiced concern about global population collapse, was responding to government data showing that Japan's population fell by a record 644,000 last year - the 11th consecutive year of decline. Some social media users said Japan was not the only developed economy experiencing long-term population decline, but others used Musk's tweet to criticise successive governments' half-hearted attempts to raise the birthrate in the world's third-biggest economy. Japan's population peaked in 2008 and had fallen to about 125 million by last year, despite government warnings about the effect on economic growth and occasional campaigns to encourage couples to have bigger families. Some Japan experts took Musk to task over his tweet. 'What is even the point of tweeting this?' wrote Tobias Harris, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. 'The anxieties surrounding Japan's demographic future is not that 'Japan will eventually cease to exist' but rather the profound social dislocations that are occurring as a result of the decline to a lower population level.' Others called on the Japanese government to further relax the country's strict rules on immigration, although plans to admit up to half a million blue-collar workers by 2025 to address serious labour shortages have been frustrated by the coronavirus pandemic. There were also calls to address the low birthrate, including making it easier for women to return to work after having children. 'They keep saying the birthrate's falling, but given that the government isn't taking thorough steps to deal with it, what can we say?' one Twitter user said. 'Everything they say and do is contradictory. 'In this environment, who's going to say 'OK, let's have a child'? I despair for Japan.' Experts blame Japan's low birthrate on several factors, including the high financial cost of bringing up children, the lack of childcare provision and notoriously long working hours.

The worst-affected area is the province of Nuoro, where the winged insects have decimated crops across 25,000 hectares (62,000 acres) of land, following swarms in 2019 said to be the worst in decades and further infestations in 2020 and 2021. Leonardo Salis, the president of the Nuoro unit of Coldiretti, the Italian farmers' association, said their passage destroyed the crops of an entire field, sending months of farmers' work and investments 'up in smoke'. The locusts are also wrecking vegetable gardens. Salis said that after three years of complaints and proposals to authorities to tackle the insects, 'we are shocked that we still find ourselves talking about the invasion of locusts'. He added: 'Farmers are now disillusioned and this year some changed their crop plan in order to try and limit the damage because they knew nothing would change. Among other things, they have not yet received a euro to compensate for the damage suffered.' Gabriella Murgia, the island's councillor for agriculture, said on Monday that an anti-locust taskforce was working unabated. 'There is no time to lose,' she told the local press, adding that the team, together with forestry workers, was identifying the worst-affected areas and accelerating pest control operations. 'The maximum collaboration of farmers and all other interested parties is required,' she said. The infestation comes days after regional authorities approved EUR2m (PS1.7m) in compensation to farmers whose crops were damaged by the insects in 2021. Christian Solinas, the president of Sardinia, told L'Unione Sarda newspaper: 'The invasion of locusts devastated the Nuoro countryside, bringing several companies to their knees. Compensation is essential to allow farmers to cope with a sharp decline in their income, guaranteeing concrete support in the face of an emergency that has added to their difficulties of recent years.'", "5a68b076b7a4fb0950685ca38a2243ce4626823124d92befa5dcdafc": "An Italian parliamentary committee has begun an investigation into the spread of disinformation, reportedly amid suspicions that some Russian commentators hosted on television networks could be on Vladimir Putin's payroll.

Enrico Borghi, a member of Copasir and politician with the centre-left Democratic party, confirmed an investigation was under way but would neither confirm nor deny a report in la Repubblica on Monday that at least three unnamed Russian guests on Italian TV were on the Kremlin's payroll. Lavrov's interview on 1 May, prompted a diplomatic row with Israel after the minister claimed that Adolf Hitler 'had Jewish blood'. The screening coincided with the appearance of the prominent pro-Kremlin journalist, Vladimir Solovyev, on the rival channel, La7. 'The fact they were both interviewed on the same night, by private networks, was really quite striking,' Borghi said. 'But this investigation is not about censorship or limiting press freedom, but this so-called hybrid war of disinformation, interference, the production of fake news and influence, which are objective themes of Russian activities against Nato, and, in particular, against Italy. These elements have increased, unfortunately, in connection with the real war.' The committee will first hear Carlo Fuortes, CEO of the state-owned broadcaster, Rai, on 12 May, followed by Giacomo Lasorella, president of the media watchdog, Agcom, on 17 May. 'Our task is to supervise the information service and security of the country. It's in the context of this activity that we carry out our work,' added Borghi. Since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Rai and other TV channels have regularly hosted Russian journalists to debate the war, sparking divisions between those who condemn the networks for giving space to 'propagandists' and those who argue that it is right to air the opinions of those on both sides of the conflict. The matter came to a head when Lavrov was interviewed on Rete 4's current affairs programme, Zona bianca, during which he dismissed the massacre in Bucha as fake news and accused the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who is Jewish, of being a Nazi. It was the first interview Lavrov had given to a European TV network since the beginning of the war. 'It seems we are the only country whose talkshows host Russian figures every day,' said Riccardo Magi, a politician with the small leftwing party, Piu Europa, said. 'Probably, in their evaluation [Italy] has a major weakness, both from the point of view of the authoritativeness of independent information and public opinion; already this type of propaganda had been well infiltrated.'", "6a6a937e17968680b45860c5b20705e72d7fe05cc583e9ce2a3157e2": "Lee Ming-che and his wife, Ching-yu, sit side by side at an ornate round table, wearing matching crisp white shirts with pages of notes in front of them. The couple have plenty to say after a five-year campaign to free Lee from a Chinese prison. Now in his late 40s, Lee is visibly slimmer than in photos of his appearance in a Chinese court in late 2017. His hair is thinner and greyer, his brow a little furrowed. Over the course of an hour-long interview, he and his wife stay close, touching or holding each other's hands and faces, sharing looks between them as if to catch up on those lost in the half decade, smiling in seeming disbelief at hearing each other's voice. 'I feel I can breathe in the fresh air of freedom, and I'm happy to be reunited with family again,' Lee says. His sudden return to Taipei last week, after serving five years in China's Chishan prison on charges of subversion, made headlines across Taiwan. His disappearance in early 2017 and subsequent sentence had sparked international campaigns for his freedom and further soured relations between Taiwan and China. The case echoed that of Hong Kong's Causeway Bay booksellers less than two years earlier, and chilled those who travelled to China holding views unfavourable to the Communist party. Lee is a human rights activist, a community college administrator and a former member of Taiwanese political parties including the Democratic Progressive party (DPP). In March 2017 he was on his way to China to meet a friend, travelling via Macau to cross into the mainland at Zhuhai city, in Guangdong. 'When I entered into Guangdong I was immediately detained by the national security department on the crime of committing incitement to subvert state power,' he recalls. 'They put a black cloth over my face and put me in a car.' Friends believed at the time of his disappearance that he had been targeted for hosting WeChat discussions about Taiwanese democracy. He says he was also helping Chinese political prisoners and their families during a time that reminded him of Taiwan's White Terror decades of martial law. 'Authorities would isolate the families and the political prisoners - it is a necessity of a dictator to isolate them so they feel lonely,' he says. 'I was transferring the knowledge of how Taiwan can become more democratic, and gave the Chinese human rights workers a knowledge weapon to use with authorities.' From Guangdong, Lee was taken into residential surveillance at a designated location (RSDL), China's notorious form of secretive detention without charge or trial, used against tens of thousands of people. Lee describes it as 'an abduction'. Authorities confirmed his detention in late March and said he was in good health, but gave no other details until his formal arrest in May that year. He was charged with subverting state power and moved out of RSDL. E-Ling Chiu, the national director of Amnesty International Taiwan, said the process of arrest and detention used against Lee were against international human rights laws and standards. 'The crime is always misused for dissidents or human rights defenders in China,' she said. Lee Ching-yu, a researcher on Taiwan's period of martial law known as White Terror, became a vocal advocate for her husband's release. Her boss, Shih Ming-teh, a well-known Taiwanese activist who spent a total of 25 years in prison during and after White Terror, became a close adviser. 'He told me that when there is a difference in civilities, between dictatorship and democracy, legal means are quite useless so you must find other ways. So I was inspired to go and look for my husband,' she says. Her advocacy - including a dramatic thwarted attempt to board a flight to China and search for him in early April 2017 - attracted criticism, but she says her husband's conditions would improve every time there was international focus on his case. After his disappearance, Taiwan's government demanded answers. It accused China of obstructing the truth and damaging cross-strait relations, and the president, Tsai Ing-wen, said she was monitoring it personally. Over the coming months the case would go before the UN working group on human rights and the US Congress, and would attract the support of the EU parliament. Lifting an arm to adjust her glasses, the edge of tattoos that Ching-yu had inked before her husband's Henan trial in September 2017, reading 'Lee Ming-che, I am proud of you', peek from beneath a cuff. 'If not for the international media attention, the release would have been more difficult and his treatment would have been more severe,' she says. At the trial Lee confessed to spreading messages on Taiwan's democracy and supporting Chinese political prisoners and their families, two things he says are normal in any democratic country, 'but when it happens in China it becomes a claim of subversion of state power'. Beijing considers Taiwan a province of China and intends to one day retake it. Taiwan's DPP government says Taiwan is a sovereign nation. Beijing cut ties after Tsai's election in 2016, and Chinese authorities take an increasingly dim view of proponents of democracy, especially those from Taiwan. On 28 November 2017 he was sentenced to five years at Chishan labor prison. He and his supporters allege he was subjected to inhumane treatment, made to eat rotten food, forced into illegal amounts of labour, and frequently denied contact with family. He was denied a visit home for his father's funeral in 2019. Ching-yu could visit for just 30 minutes at a time, but after criticising prison conditions she was temporarily banned. Then came the Covid pandemic, further restricting visits. 'Shih said what a political prisoner fears the most is that they'll be forgotten in jail,' says Ching-yu. 'I would have 30 minutes every month to meet Ming-che, and my boss told me to use it wisely. Do not cry. Tell him how much the world and I have done for him ... There was a lot of worry inside of me that he would be changed into a man I could no longer recognise. But it was the man I fell in love with who returned.' The couple found out Lee was coming home at about the same time, just days before his flight. Lee feared he would be released from prison but forced to stay in China, until guards asked him for personal details to book a flight. For five years Lee had imagine seeing his wife at the airport as he stepped on to Taiwanese soil. Instead he was whisked through Taiwan's strict quarantine requirements and taxied to the centre, where he finally saw Ching-yu - through a pane of glass. Ching-yu smiles and cries as she recalls the night. 'We spoke on the phone for 16 hours. He shared a lot of his experiences from jail,' she says. Since Lee was first jailed, the rule of Xi Jinping over China has hardened. Relations between Taiwan and Beijing are their worst in decades. Activists and dissidents have been arrested, and millions of people have been subjected to religious and cultural oppression in Xinjiang. Lee notes there are four Taiwanese political prisoners in Chinese jails, and he calls for more global attention on Ilham Tohti, a Uyghur economist jailed since 2014 with no outside contact. Lee remains adamant of his innocence and unapologetic for his work, which he intends to continue. 'The work I have done was for human rights and for humanity, so I had no regrets for what I did,' he says. 'Because of my faith in it I have no doubt in what I did and I had confidence in my wife and her boss and my country Taiwan, and believed I was not abandoned.'", "feb951a15129b2594fe3abb69160c82a421da6f1a5f67551e753ca46": "Police in north-east Thailand have arrested a self-proclaimed holy man whose followers allegedly worshipped corpses and consumed bodily fluids as a cure for illness. There were chaotic scenes as officers raided the thatched house of Thawee Nanra, 75, deep in the jungle of Chaiyaphum province on Sunday. Supporters shouted and jostled with police as he was led, shirtless and white-bearded, to a police vehicle. Officers said they had found 11 corpses on the premises, which local media reported were believed to be bodies of his followers. The provincial governor, Kraisorn Kongchalad, said Thawee had at least a dozen followers living with him. Coffins containing bodies were scattered around the house. Devotees reportedly told authorities that the leader's urine and phlegm were believed to cure diseases. Kraisorn said he had been shocked to discover that such practices still went on in modern times. 'It's quite disturbing to see that there are people who believe in such superstition, but this is not only about a personal belief any more. We have dead bodies, and we will have to work with all agencies to establish facts surrounding these individuals,' he said. Thailand's population is overwhelming Buddhist, but many people hold beliefs outside the religion, some of which include the worship of local spirits and fear of ghosts. The authorities believe the group had existed for more than four years without anyone noticing because of the remote location of the leader's house. Their anonymity ended after a daughter of one of Thawee's followers complained to a social media celebrity who specialises in exposing unscrupulous religious figures. Thawee was initially charged with encroaching on a forest area - his house was said to be on public land - and holding illegal gatherings prohibited under disease control laws that have been used in the past two years to curb the spread of Covid-19. Local media reported that he had been denied bail on Monday. Police say they are looking into other charges, including the unlawful disposal of bodies.", "6a1b3ac6f1e9f08b0066d39439dee199a94a924a89bda0808ad92c5e": "A US firm known for betting against companies' share prices has said Elon Musk could submit a lower bid for Twitter, owing to a slump in tech stocks and a weak financial performance at the social media platform. Hindenburg Research said there was a 'significant chance' that the Tesla chief executive will seek to pay less than the agreed bid price of $54.20 (PS43.90) a share, which values Twitter at $44bn and has been accepted by the company's board. 'We are supportive of Musk's efforts to take Twitter private and see a significant chance the deal will close at a lower price,' said Hindenburg in a note published on Monday. It said the tech-dominated Nasdaq stock market had fallen sharply since the world's richest person revealed he had taken an initial stake in Twitter on 4 April, implying a lower share price for the social media plaform, whose value has been held up by the takeover situation. Hindenburg said that if Musk walked away, Twitter's shares could be caught up in the negative sentiment surrounding the Nasdaq and fall by 50%. Hindenburg added that Twitter's recent quarterly results had been poor and had not been priced into the stock, while Musk could pay a $1bn breakup fee to walk away from the deal. The investment research firm also dismissed speculation that Twitter could enforce a clause in the takeover agreement that required the multibillionaire to complete the deal. 'Musk has incredible leverage to renegotiate should he choose to,' said Hindenburg, which said it had taken a short position on Twitter. A short position is where an entity borrows shares in a company in the expectation that the price will fall. The entity sells those shares and then expects to buy them back at a lower price before returning them to the lender - pocketing the profit. Shares in Twitter fell 2.6% at $48.50 in afternoon trading in New York. Hindenburg said the deal as structured would leave Twitter with a high amount of debt and would make it difficult for Musk to achieve his goal of reducing the company's reliance on advertising. Adverts account for 90% of Twitter's $5bn in annual revenue. The deal is being part-funded through $27.25bn of cash, $7.1bn of which is coming from a group of investors and the rest from Musk. A further $6.25bn is in loans secured against Musk's shares in Tesla, with $13bn provided in debt financing. The bank debt will cost Twitter about $800m-$900m a year in interest payments. Hindenburg rose to prominence last year by taking an aggressive stance against special purpose acquisition companies, or Spacs, which are blank cheque vehicles that raise money from investors first and seek businesses to buy afterwards.", "e1494823ed0056dd9965a7061113a7c5b6a76d910a380afdc6e945b7": "Sixty-two years after the end of British rule, Cyprus has taken another step out of the shadow of its colonial past with a deal that ushers in the biggest change in land use on the island since independence. Describing the accord as groundbreaking, the president of the Republic of Cyprus, Nicos Anastasiades, said it would enable thousands of Cypriots to develop properties in the 'sovereign base areas' that Britain has long held on to in the Mediterranean country. That, he said, would not only yield 'multiple benefits', but correct 'distortions and imbalances' in the lives of residents living in villages incorporated in the facilities. 'This is a truly historic agreement,' the leader told officials gathered in Nicosia's presidential palace on Monday. '[It] is expected to not only have important development prospects for those who reside, or who have properties, on the bases, but for the economy and society more generally at an especially difficult time following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.' The sovereign base areas - which include military bases, but also farms and residential land - account for 3% of the island's total landmass, or 98 sq miles. Although the accord was reached in 2014 under Britain's then prime minister, David Cameron, it required years of complex negotiations underscored by the peculiar nature of territory that, while home to about 12,000 Cypriots, remained in the possession of the country's former colonial power. On 16 May, when the deal comes into effect, owners will be able to submit planning applications to develop properties much as they can elsewhere on the island. Until now, non-military development of base areas, with the exception of agricultural land, has been tightly controlled, eliciting disquiet among local people, who have complained of being penalised in a country already divided since the 1974 Turkish invasion. Calling the accord 'a memorable moment' in ties between the two nations, Britain's high commissioner to Cyprus, Stephen Lillie, predicted that it would contribute greatly to the quality of life for those living on the military bases. 'Our agreement means that, as far as possible, residents in the bases will now enjoy the same rights as Cypriots living in the republic to sell and develop their land and property and all the benefits that brings,' Lillie said. 'I take pride in the fact that we have worked together to deliver a change that will have a real and positive impact on people's lives.' Restrictions have meant that much of the territory has remained unspoiled in contrast to otherwise heavily developed coastline in the rest of the island's south. As of next week, planning zones and policies in force elsewhere will come into effect, but the commander of British Forces Cyprus, Maj Gen Rob Thomson, insisted that development would also be subject to environmental and security controls. The installations are viewed as huge strategic assets by the UK, with RAF Akrotiri used as a forward mounting base for multiple operations across the region. Post-Brexit and in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the facilities' strategic advantage has intensified. In a first visit to the island by a chief of general staff in almost a decade, Gen Sir Mark Carleton-Smith highlighted Cyprus' significance to the British military. 'The UK is fortunate to enjoy a close bilateral partnership with the Republic of Cyprus and we retain sovereign bases here and have for many decades,' he said. 'They offer a military platform for us to base troops in the eastern Mediterranean but also to use it as a springboard to shorten our response times across the region. It's a region with a degree of strategic volatility and it's to our military advantage to acclimatise, train and prepare troops here in Cyprus.'", "4fc3f23d325c3601b68108d6457f6668edf434d88c495e988062df56": "There is still a long way to go before South Africa and other developing countries can manufacture Covid vaccines and treatments quickly and without paying the huge charges demanded by the big US and European drug companies. Last week, the World Trade Organization (WTO) announced that the 180-member trade forum had taken a step towards a patent waiver that would allow developing countries to make the drugs they need - including vaccines, tests, and treatments - for as long as five years, without payments to pharma giants such as Pfizer.  The EU, India, South Africa and the US, known as the Quad, claimed to have come to an agreement on the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (Trips) waiver proposal, with China also expected to vote in favour.  Except the deal only provided for a continuation of Quad negotiations, and on the table at the moment is no more than what was on the table last year. Max Lawson, co-chair of pressure group People's Vaccine Alliance, said: 'It is a tragedy that it has taken almost two years and millions of deaths to reach this point, and a travesty that the action proposed falls well short of what is needed.' Health and anti-poverty campaigners say WTO boss Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, elected last year amid a fanfare of hope and expectation, appears to have provided cover for big pharma rather than pushing for wider access, as she promised. Ngozi's supporters say she is playing a long game, though Covid-19 may be a distant memory - and Pfizer shareholders even richer than they are today - by the time this long game plays out. She is understood to be in favour of a full waiver, but progress towards a breakthrough remains elusive, despite official claims to the contrary. Lawson said the WTO continues to place corporate interests over the needs of global health. 'It adds more unnecessary barriers than existed before negotiations began, and failure to act now on treatments and tests is inexcusable.' EU nations, distracted as they are by the war in Ukraine, want their own big pharma to rival firms in the US.  Which is why, Lawson added, 'this is not the Trips waiver supported by over 100 governments. It is not endorsed by any member other than the EU. And it is utterly insufficient for a pandemic that has killed an estimated 20 million people and rising'. Other experts have been demanding comprehensive change for months. In a letter to South African president Cyril Ramaphosa in March, Peter Kamalingin, Oxfam's pan-Africa director, Jayati Ghosh, professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, and Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, accused the WTO of failing to deliver 'any meaningful access to vaccines, treatments, or tests'.  They said the EU had launched a 'belligerent blockade of any actual waiver of intellectual property (IP) barriers' and criticised the US for its 'insistence that the IP waiver it supports be limited to vaccines'. The EU and US have also required countries to seek authorisation on a product-by-product basis, 'meaning no simplified pathway for follow-on manufacturers to produce and enter the market', they wrote. The three experts, who support South Africa's campaign for a full-waiver of all IP and patents on Covid medicines, said the WTO proposals needed to cover lifesaving treatments and diagnostics for Covid-19 because they are a vital part of an arsenal to prevent, treat and contain the virus. The problems faced by Ramaphosa in seeking to move the sluggish decision-making apparatus at the WTO are compounded by the complexity of vaccine manufacture, which relies on more than just access to patent information. He knows that taking off the table the secrets behind treatments for Covid-19 severely limits the ability of poorer countries' health systems from tackling further outbreaks of the disease. The People's Vaccine Alliance adds that another demand of the EU, that countries wanting to manufacture Covid-19 vaccines must 'notify the WTO's Trips council before exercising any of these rights', was 'akin to putting a target on your back for pressure from nations housing big pharmaceutical companies'. Why would the EU and US play hardball? Moderna and Pfizer, which uses the German firm Biontech's IP, will have new vaccines on the market by the autumn - known as 'bivalent' vaccines, that address Omicron as well as the other previous incarnations of Covid-19. German firm CureVac has partnered with Britain's GSK to make their own version. Lots of other pharma companies are in the hunt. This means that once again there will soon be new, better drugs for the rich countries, with developing nations at the back of the queue - and still paying top dollar for earlier vaccines less tailored to viral variants and mutations.", "2bae21eff9476ccd09057a57daaa20b00df79fe4d5df2789e8c7f5ac": "", "c1e088ad0edc57a4dd8b19e3fdee91029ba8d901e0564a6250b13525": "", "57b99c7fbe47a5085c17146d8e527652e5f154f6096c0ea9a5cc5644": "", "ec571867d4981c3b70234ec571e6ed915c55446dd9dd0b7d80baed1c": "", "a2c185cb8c89b3ef6367289dc872631e7c368a3acda3d9bd0f229d83": "", "a710f82c0f7f19739ff0e2b1a4ba9477c58a396c5d5f788bc28ca7fc": "", "9b8395667a3b455de338a5997a11e3dd3cecfc7eedecf813753db61b": "", "cf8b09df8961bc85165751dc7890e00c4b2c83ec3d55e12e5bc1b9af": "", "4ab5833814642a752c35dc8edcf0c641e0fbffba93ad24d9be27dfe1": "", "dddf3d76322fb56713529ae35c6b5ea699ac64ea3c0302371b3e6e50": "Say what you like about Donald Trump's supporters, you cannot fault them for commitment. When the former president arrived for his latest rally in a deeply rural corner of western Pennsylvania, many had already been standing in solid rain for 10 hours. The field in which they were to greet their revered leader was a mud bath. By the time Trump finally arrived, 20 minutes late, the scene had taken on the qualities of the apocalypse - like the closing sequences of the Fyre festival. On this occasion, the seemingly boundless patience of Trump's devoted followers was being put to the test for an additional reason. He had come to the Westmoreland Fairgrounds outside Greensburg to sprinkle Trump stardust on his preferred choice for the US Senate seat vacated by retiring Republican senator Pat Toomey. Whether Pennsylvanian conservatives go along with the endorsement when the primary is held on 17 May will have big consequences, not merely on Trump's record of advancing his chosen people - and with it his grip on the Republican party. It will also have ramifications for the November election which, in tune with recent contests in the state, is almost certain to be nail-bitingly close and could be critical in determining whether the Republicans retake the Senate. The trouble is, many Trump supporters don't know what to make of Mehmet Oz, the celebrity TV surgeon better known as Dr Oz. 'We love Trump, but we'll be booing Oz,' said Pam, 46, a local educator who asked to give only her first name. She admitted one of the reasons she had turned up in the first place was to see how hostile her fellow Trump supporters would be towards the candidate. In the end, after all that sodden waiting, Pam was disappointed. Occasional booing could be heard earlier in the evening whenever Oz was mentioned, but when the man himself took to the stage, whether by design or accident, the music was cranked up so loud that it was impossible to tell jeering from cheering. By now the pattern is well established. Prominent individuals are so desperate for Trump's blessing that they suspend cognitive functioning and act as his slavish mouthpiece. The phenomenon was vividly illustrated after the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol last year. Republican leaders including Kevin McCarthy were at first critical of Trump's role but then began faithfully repeating his big lie that the election had been stolen from him. More recently, JD Vance, the venture capitalist author of Hillbilly Elegy, ditched his earlier criticisms of Trump in order to win the former president's endorsement in the race for a US Senate seat in Ohio. The humiliating gambit paid off last week, with Vance sealing the Republican primary having received a bounce from Trump's backing. Of all the many examples of this form, there has rarely been as dramatic a shedding of fact-based reasoning in exchange for Trump's universe of alternative facts than that displayed by Oz. He has descended from the scientific heights of a renowned cardiothoracic surgeon, down through his promotion of quack remedies on his daytime TV show, and into a full-Maga embrace of the Trump big lie. Oz, 61, has an impeccable medical background. Born in Cleveland, Ohio, he is the son of Turkish immigrants and followed his father into cardiothoracic surgery, with Ivy League training at Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania. At his peak, he was an innovator in minimally invasive heart surgery. At Columbia University, where he treated patients until 2018, he authored numerous peer-reviewed papers bearing impenetrable sentences like this one: 'In the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, CPB time, previous cardiac surgery, sternal wound infection, postoperative renal failure, and postoperative stroke were all associated with increased risk of mortality following MICS.' His weakness - or strength? - was the allure of fame and fortune. In 1996 he performed a heart transplant on the brother of the New York Yankees manager in the middle of a World Series which the Yankees won. Such extraordinary serendipity turned him into a media darling. Oprah Winfrey came calling, dubbing him 'America's doctor', and the end result was The Dr Oz Show which ran until this January. His show included public-service broadcasting, bringing attention to type 2 diabetes and encouraging his viewers to eat more healthily. But over time he slid into controversial territory. By 2014 he was being called a 'snake oil peddler' and hauled before a US Senate committee for touting 'miracle' diet products on The Dr Oz Show. 'I don't get why you need to say this stuff because you know it's not true,' Claire McCaskill, then senator from Missouri, berated him. During the pandemic, he championed several of the same discredited pseudoscience treatments such as hydroxychloroquine pushed by Trump. To complete the decline, the cardiothoracic surgeon has now incorporated into his Pennsylvania Senate campaign the falsehood that the 2020 presidential election that Trump lost was riddled with fraud. 'I have discussed it with President Trump and we cannot move on,' he said at a recent televised debate for the Republican primary. 'We have to be serious about what happened in 2020.' There is no evidence that fraud on a significant scale occurred in the 2020 election, in Pennsylvania or anywhere else. The problem with being a daytime TV host is that you leave a very long paper trail. Oz's rivals for the Republican nomination have been bombarding Pennsylvania voters with attack ads portraying him as a 'Hollywood liberal' and a Rino - Republican In Name Only. Among the inconvenient truths that the adverts regurgitate is the time that Oz invited Michelle Obama onto his show, his reflections on systemic racism and how it leads to disparities in health outcomes, and his discussions on how to reduce deaths and injuries from guns. The attack ads have featured a 2019 interview in which he questioned Republican states that were introducing bills to ban abortion at six weeks known as heartbeat bills. 'But the heart's not beating,' Oz is shown accurately saying. And then there was the segment on his show that he called 'Transgender kids: too young to decide?' where he invited children experiencing gender dysphoria and their parents to talk about their journey. The downpour of negative political adverts carrying politically awkward clips from the Oz show has clearly had an impact on the race. Latest polls show the Republican primary race as too close to call, with the TV personality in a slim lead on 18% to the 16% of his main rival, the super-wealthy former hedge fund CEO David McCormick. By contrast, the Democratic field of candidates appears to be already settled with a clear frontrunner: Pennsylvania's lieutenant governor, John Fetterman.  He is a champion of labour unions, legalised marijuana and combating inequalities in income, health and housing. Certainly, doubts about Oz remained prevalent among the Trump devotees braving the Westmoreland rain on Friday night. 'I'm leary,' said Ken Rockhill, 52. 'I want to trust Trump's candidate, but I'm leary. He's going to have to prove himself.' Rockhill, an artist from Pittsburgh, said his doubts about Oz stemmed from the candidate's time as a TV personality. Which was odd, given that Trump himself carries the same lineage. 'Oz was caught up with that whole Hollywood thing with his show,' Rockhill said. 'He was big with the Obamas, hobnobbing with all the stars - that never ends well.' Sharon Nagle, 60, a bartender from a small coalmining town, said she was troubled by Oz's dual US-Turkish citizenship. That issue has also been seized upon by Oz's Republican rivals who have called his Turkish ties a national security risk, forcing him to promise to renounce his Turkish citizenship should he win the Senate seat. Nagle also objects to Oz's Muslim identity. 'I love Trump, but he's got this wrong. I will never vote for a Muslim - they plan to take over America from within and pass sharia-style laws. That's what I think, and I'm not a bigot.' Pam, the Trump supporter who had come to see whether Oz would be booed off stage, said that as a Christian her antipathy to him stemmed from a 2010 episode of The Dr Oz Show that featured an eight-year-old girl who had transitioned from her male gender at birth. 'To use your platform to say a boy aged eight can change gender - that's evil,' she said. Did she think Trump had made a mistake in endorsing him? Yes, Pam said, showing a surprising willingness to question the former president's judgment despite being a fervent Maga supporter. 'The man is not God,' Pam said, referring to Trump. 'He puts his pants on, one leg at a time.' Out of curiosity, the Guardian asked Pam whether she ever watched The Dr Oz Show. Her eyes lit up and she beamed. 'Oh yes,' she said. 'We love the Dr Oz show!' Political strategists at the rally worked extra hard to try and overcome the chilly response to the Oz endorsement. Vance was rolled out on stage, with the clear hope that the victory he pulled out of the hat last week might somehow rub off on Oz. The crowd was assailed through the evening with 30-second videos attempting to debunk the portrayal of the candidate given in the attack ads. Here was Oz surrounded by children insisting life begins at conception. Here was Oz dressed in lumberjack shirt brandishing a double-barreled shotgun - how could this man be against the second amendment? When Oz finally addressed the crowd he reassured them that he was one of them - a genuine Maga man. 'The president endorsed me as an America First candidate ... President Trump endorsed me because I am smart, I am tough and I will never let you down.' Then Trump himself bigged up his chosen candidate. 'We endorse a lot of people a little out of the box,' he said, paying the subtlest lip service to his followers' misgivings. He reminded the crowd how Oz had invited him onto his show in 2016, giving the then presidential hopeful a great bill of health though telling him to lose a few pounds. 'Dr Oz has had an enormously successful career on TV and now he's running to save our country from the radical lunatics,' Trump said. Being Trump, his most passionate argument for voting for Oz was also the most quizzical. 'His show is great. He's on that screen, he's in the bedrooms of all those women telling them good and bad.' It's not quite clear what Trump meant by that. Will it be the Trump magic needed to put Oz over the finish line? We'll know in eight days' time. ", "52c1a55c238621f36fd49e063ff977b9311530e8007040d1cf44e731": "In this Zoom call, four men are looking at a list of family duties and marking which they do themselves and which they have been leaving to their partners. Earning money. School run. Laundry. Ironing. Cooking. Cleaning the bathroom. Buying school uniform. Putting children to bed ... Next, they discuss why that may be. 'It's just how we operate,' says one, a man who is no longer living with his partner, but spending a lot of time with her and their new baby. 'She loves cooking. I don't iron. She does iron ...' He runs out of steam. 'The way I look at it, I've been married 20 years and you evolve into what you do,' says another. 'That's how you decide what your jobs are. I do cook a meal occasionally but 95% of the time, she does the cooking and plans the shopping because she knows what she needs to feed the family. I earn the money to pay for it.' The third man is currently single. 'I used to take things for granted when I was in a relationship,' he says. 'Dinner being on the table, having clean clothes, having ironed clothes. I never really thought about it when I came in the door. I'm not sure that was being abusive; it's just the way things worked. Well ... until we split up. Maybe that's why.' This quiet contemplation of the domestic workload shows how far these men have come. This is the 12th module of the Lifeline behaviour-change course run by My CWA, a Cheshire-based charity that supports families affected by domestic abuse. All four of these men have been abusive to partners. Their attendance here is voluntary; two were referred by social workers, the other two referred themselves. One even moved to the area, living with his brother, just to qualify for the support (before the pandemic it was face-to-face group meetings; now it is delivered through Zoom). Only about half the men who start Lifeline stick with it to the end. There is no compulsion, it's a long and demanding course, and it requires perpetrators to take full responsibility for their actions with all the emotional consequences this may bring. These four, however, have already come a long way. They have completed level 1, which takes about 10 weeks. They discussed what brought each of them there and unpacked the worst incidents of abuse, along with their feelings and thoughts at the time. It taught them some safety strategies and emergency techniques to help them de-escalate and step back when tensions rise. Now they are more than halfway through level 2, which takes 22 to 24 weeks. Today they are covering the role of gender in abusive relationships. Next week, it's 'healthy sexual relationships'. Many of them found last week's session particularly tough. It was on the impact on children, and began with the men listening to a recording of a terrified child calling 999 as her mum is being beaten up at home. Then Colette Foster, the course leader, laid out the effects for children of witnessing domestic abuse - the impact on their educational attainment and life chances, and their increased risk of suicide, cancer, heart disease and substance abuse. She set out how it affects offspring of all ages, from babies to adults. She told the men what signs to look for and the men discussed their own children - and their own childhoods. Unsurprisingly, it became emotional: one man became so upset that Foster checked in with him the next day to ensure he was OK and would be coming back. Yet today he is here discussing housework, and how to show appreciation to a partner. ('This session hasn't been as head-doing as some of the others,' he is relieved to say at the end.) For decades, perpetrator programmes like this have been low profile and low priority. Spending scarce resources on abusers has been viewed with deep suspicion across much of the women's sector, where the focus and the funding have, unsurprisingly, been on the survivors. In 2019/20, 64% of refuge referrals were turned away and the number of refuge bed spaces in England was 30% below the level recommended by the Council of Europe. Only just over a third of services were able to provide formal counselling to women in their refuges. Just over a quarter were running without a dedicated resettlement service. 'Finding a refuge space is like finding gold dust,' is how Sandra Horley, former CEO of Refuge, put it in 2016. 'How can we justify spending money on therapy for perpetrators when terrified and brutalised women and children have nowhere to go?' Now, however, something is shifting. Respect, the UK's lead organisation on perpetrator programmes, has firmly positioned itself as part of the movement tackling violence against women and girls. Some of its programmes are delivered in partnership with groups such as Women's Aid, or the domestic violence charity SafeLives. And a six-year evaluation of 11 Respect-accredited UK perpetrator programmes by Durham and London Metropolitan universities found significant improvement over a range of behaviours. Interviewing partners, ex-partners, children and perpetrators, researchers found that reports of women being physically injured dropped from 61% before the programme to 2% afterwards. Cases of children seeing or hearing violence dropped from 80% to 8%. The results have been compelling enough for the Home Office to get behind them: in March, its Tackling Domestic Abuse Plan pledged PS75m for perpetrator programmes - far more than it ever had before. Saskia Lightburn-Ritchie, the CEO of My CWA, understands why it has taken so long to get here. When she introduced Lifeline more than a decade ago, she wasn't convinced it was the right way to spend resources. At the time, My CWA provided support, including refuges, to survivors of domestic abuse, but many survivors said that even when they had successfully separated from their abuser, the abuse continued, especially if co-parenting was involved. 'They were saying that no one at all was talking to the men about their behaviour, and it might help if someone would,' says Lightburn-Ritchie. 'It seemed a reasonable and sensible request - but it opened a can of worms.' When My CWA launched the Lifeline pilot, there was vehement opposition from the north-west women's sector. Women's Aid tried to cancel its membership. 'On a personal level, I'd been a victim of domestic abuse myself. I'd lived in a refuge,' says Lightburn-Ritchie. 'Then I'd spent 20 years working in women-only services. I wasn't sure that I could treat the men on the programme with respect. I thought I'd struggle with my own feelings about what they'd done. And I wasn't even confident that change was possible.' Yet she also believed it made sense to try. 'We focus all our efforts on victims and children, which is right,' she says. 'But, by not engaging with perpetrators and trying to hold them to account in a way that they can make a change, all we are doing is condemning any new person in a relationship with them to the same behaviours, the same abuse. It's just recreated in another family. It's like tackling a huge problem by only looking at symptoms not the cause, and it makes you tired. Well, it makes me tired. I want that cycle to break.' Lightburn-Ritchie has very clear memories of delivering the first programme. 'I was very surprised at my own reaction,' she says. 'I was able to see them as whole individuals whose behaviours were wrong but who had other positive features. There was one man who was really getting it, having lightbulb moments, so engaged. Then his child became very unwell, he wasn't coping and he assaulted his partner. I was devastated. But, for the first time ever, he didn't breach bail, he didn't pressure her to withdraw the charges; he pleaded guilty straight away.' That was a breakthrough. Lifeline is accredited by Respect - and the accreditation system couldn't be more critical. Respect was formed 21 years ago when a handful of perpetrator programmes joined together, partly to raise the profile of their work, but also to articulate good practice at a time when they worried about perpetrators setting up self-help groups, or short interventions such as weekend courses, and simplistic 'anger management' programmes. (Most perpetrators are already 'managing their anger' very precisely. They manage not to explode at their boss or the big man at the gym, but still terrorise and control their partners.) Ciara Bergman, Respect's head of perpetrator services, cautions that programmes that don't adhere to certain principles could make things worse. 'When you're delivering perpetrator work, the primary client is not the person in front of you,' she says. 'It has to be focused on the adult and child survivors of that abuse. We don't think any work should take place with perpetrators in the absence of parallel but separate support for survivors.' Because of this, a Respect-accredited programme will only take on a perpetrator if their partner (or ex-partner if there are children and contact) agrees to be involved. A separate 'partner-support worker' will then keep them informed and supported throughout. 'One of the most persuasive factors for a woman remaining with an abusive partner is the hope that they will get better,' says Bergman. 'If a perpetrator says: 'I'm going off on a programme to fix my behaviour', she might choose to stay in a risky situation. Then if he stops attending, she might not know.' (On one Respect training session, I see a letter sent to a partner purporting to be from the programme facilitators, although it was actually written by the perpetrator himself: 'We want to let you know that Mr X is fully engaged with the programme and has shown willingness and real commitment to making the necessary changes ...') 'A lot of perpetrators are very manipulative,' says Bergman. 'They may come home and say: 'I've spoken to the facilitators, and they say it's your fault. They say you need to do XYZ.'' The Lifeline course leaders are also trained to recognise deception or 'disguise compliance', where a perpetrator may say all the right things, but mean none of them. However, Lightburn-Ritchie is convinced the courses can have real impact. 'There are a few key sessions that astound me every time they are delivered,' she says. 'One is impact on children. Often the men have an innate belief that, although their behaviours are harmful, they are still 'good dads'. They manage to live with that dichotomy. When they start listening and making a connection with what they've done and their own children's experience, I've seen men who have served prison sentences break down and cry.' Another powerful session is around healthy sexual relationships. 'I remember interviewing someone after he'd completed the course to see how he got on, four years later,' she says. 'We'd never met before. He told me the hardest part had been to acknowledge that he'd sexually assaulted his wife - and that, actually, it was rape. Then he said he had to admit to himself that he'd always known, but just not listened to himself. It devastated him, but he said: 'I had to be broken to be fixed.' 'He wrote his ex-wife a huge letter of apology, taking responsibility. She didn't get in touch and he had accepted that he couldn't make her and didn't expect anything of her. He was in a new relationship that was running smoothly. There was a huge amount of growth. I was gobsmacked.' John, 28, has been through a Respect-accredited programme and agrees to speak to me. Although he is quiet and cautious, his words are compelling. He found the programme - Route2 in Middlesbrough - through an internet search and referred himself. It is one-on-one, with similar content to Lifeline. (He had previously attended a group programme but walked out. 'I just got sick of listening to people beating about the bush, saying it was their partner's fault,' he says.) He says he has only had one serious relationship in his life, which lasted two years. 'It was abusive for a while,' he says. 'It ended badly in 2019. It got to the point where I was arrested. I don't want to tell you what I did. I'm not over it. I'm still learning from it.' He began Route2 in early 2020, initially on Zoom, then in person when lockdown eased. 'What helped most was going deep into why my behaviour was the way it was,' he says. 'For me, I always thought that I was a bad person. Nina, my case manager, helped me think about my own family, the way I grew up and the part all that played. I'm not using my childhood as an excuse, but it helped me understand. Nina was more on the side of what I need to change, instead of judging me. She put different thoughts in my head.' Almost two years on, he still calls Nina every week, just to check in, and he is still single. 'I'm not ready for any relationship; I'm focused on being better myself,' he says. For John, the programme feels worthwhile. 'I'll be brutally honest. You can't help someone who doesn't think they're in the wrong. If you accept what you've done, if you really want help and you've stopped blaming everyone else, then anyone can change.'

She was in such severe constant pain, and unable to sleep for more than two continuous hours a night, that she was retired on ill health from her job at National Grid 'at the grand old age of 33'. She says: 'I had to stop work because the pain was too much. It's been very depressing; I really enjoyed my job. I tried so many different therapies and managed to get my arthritis under control but for fibromyalgia, there isn't anything, no magical pill.' She was taking up to 40 tablets a day, including 14 prescriptions such as opiate painkillers, as well as sleeping pills and laxatives to relieve the constipation caused by the painkillers. Wright would never consider smoking cannabis recreationally but started inhaling medicinal cannabis as part of a study run by the private London pain clinic LVL Health in January. 'To begin with I was completely knocked out but you do get used to it. Straight away my sleep was a million times better. I probably hadn't had a proper night's sleep since 2012. I stopped taking any sleeping pills. My pain levels have completely dropped as well.' Her next step is to start weaning herself off the opiate painkillers. She will always have to take some medication but is now working as an operations manager for Flowaime, a Cadent (previously National Grid) contractor. 'I'm able to work longer hours and go into the office. I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing now if it wasn't for medical cannabis. It's been life-changing.'", "36f2e53b525a1d67e435af04169c7e0f96bb98f9c295c57159460120": "Tuesday's Queen's speech is meant to be a relaunch for Boris Johnson's beleaguered government, against the backdrop of a deep cost of living crisis, and with Tory backbenchers still divided about his future. But if the advance briefing is anything to go by, this is an administration with little fresh to offer. A 'bonfire of red tape' is certainly not revolutionary: Gordon Brown had the Hampton review and the Better Regulation taskforce; George Osborne had his own 'bonfire of red tape', not to mention a 'Red Tape Challenge'. With the benefit of hindsight, most such efforts are widely viewed as worthy, but incremental. Of course, freed from the shackles of the EU, the government has more wriggle room to make regulatory change; but the examples given by Boris Johnson during the leave campaign - the size of olive oil bottles and the packaging for fish - underline the modest scale of what is likely to be possible. Such tweaks would also almost certainly be dwarfed by post-Brexit border bureaucracy. Some bills will enact crucial but long-promised changes, such as reform of the school funding formula, or ensuring Companies House, the official register of companies, combats fraud. Other plans, such as the levelling up bill, giving local authorities the power to force landlords to rent out empty shops and take control of empty buildings, appear modest, but are clearly designed to deliver the changes 'red wall' voters may hope to see if they are to stick with Johnson at the next general election. A new British bill of rights, meanwhile, allows the government to keep one of its favourite culture wars, the battle against 'lefty lawyers', burning brightly, while Channel 4 privatisation would cheer the party's rightwingers. But the overall sense, as with mooted plans for tackling the cost of living crisis that included two-yearly MOTs, is of a government scrabbling around for ideas. Part of the difficulty, for an administration which has never had much of a guiding purpose beyond Brexit and keeping Johnson in power, is knowing what its electoral constituency is. In Friday's local election results, the Tories received a kicking from the Lib Dems in the south, amplifying the warning signal sent by the Chesham and Amersham byelection last year. So the list of expected bills appears shot through with the contradictions of trying to keep north and south, red wall and blue wall, onside. Hence the toned-down planning reform mooted by Michael Gove at the weekend: gone is the no-holds-barred approach drawn up by his predecessor, Robert Jenrick, that was intended to disfranchise Nimbies and lead to a drastic increase in housebuilding. Instead, local authorities will apparently be given more latitude in applying housing targets; and Gove was full of soothing talk of small-c conservative developments such as Prince Charles's favourite, Poundbury in Dorset. While Conservative campaign headquarters sources continue to deny that an autumn election is even a remote possibility, there is also a whiff of Lynton Crosby's notorious advice to David Cameron to 'get the barnacles off the boat', too. Gone is the ban on foie gras and fur, it appears - and gone, too, the employment bill that would have strengthened workers' rights, but perhaps couldn't be easily shoehorned into the theme of levelling up. Plenty of legislative time will also be taken up working through bills carried over from the last parliamentary session - including on animal welfare and online safety. It remains to be seen whether Johnson can fashion a coherent narrative out of Tuesday's pomp and ceremony. But as after Rishi Sunak's spring statement, there is a clear risk that again, the main impression is of a government that has failed to grasp the scale of the crisis at hand.", "1fd617ddd67e67b5cfe41a03b294cb453ac4f4594f0c33980f3f547d": "Few places in Afghanistan are run by women. Public life and business are male-dominated and, since the Taliban's takeover, even more women have vanished from view. While some say they are stuck in conservative societal structures that rarely let them take control, others fear draconian new rules, the travel and education bans. But behind the walls of several female-run hospitals in Kabul, a different reality exists: here, women save lives on a daily basis, offer marriage advice, care for and adopt abandoned children. Many of the doctors and nurses working here have raised children and often remain their family's sole financial supporters. And they all agree: things work better when women run the show. 'We actually had a few men working here before the Taliban took over, but since this is mostly a maternity hospital, they kicked them out. Today it's women working for women,' Jagona Faizli, a gynaecologist, tells the Guardian. She is a mother of 'three beautiful daughters' whose husband is a stay-at-home father, covering her regular night shifts. 'He's the strongest man I've met, because he pushes against society's norms here,' she says. 'We married for love and I'd choose him again any day.' Faizli, 31, says her position at the hospital has given her the opportunity to talk openly and to get to know both her patients and staff well. 'There is no man to be seen, which is why I feel free in this hospital. Many of the women coming here tell me about their marriage difficulties. I try to give them advice and counsel them; I try to help where I can.' That is not all the women do. Mariam Maqsoodi, a 29-year-old resident doctor, says that after a rise in abandoned newborns at the hospital - probably due to Afghanistan's economic crisis - they have formed an 'adoption committee' to ensure the babies are taken care of. 'We register families who can't have children and would like to adopt, and if we can't find a family for the babies, one of our staff usually adopts,' she says, adding: 'It's sad. We recently had a little boy whose mother died while giving birth, and his father ran away without taking him home. We make sure each child is taken care of.' Up to 100 children a day are born at the hospital where Maqsoodi works - the doctors asked for the name of the clinic to be omitted for security reasons - and at least 140 female staff take care of all operations. 'I have four children myself and I miss them during the day, but I tell them I have an important job to do. When the Taliban took over, 12 of our hospital's doctors left the country. 'We were all afraid and most of us wanted to leave,' Maqsoodi adds, 'but we're still here saving lives.' It has been difficult. The women say they feel under pressure from the Taliban. After the Islamists' takeover in August, many of the medics stayed at home for weeks, too scared to go to work. Slowly, most of them returned to their jobs. 'We keep pressing on,' Faizli says. 'Even the Taliban know that they need us.' Places run by women are now even rarer in a country run by an all-male government, which has removed women from public office since August and continues to ban older girls from receiving an education. As the Taliban scramble to set up a functioning government, criticism of Afghanistan's new leaders is widespread. Human Rights Watch has accused them of imposing policies that have violated rights and created huge barriers for women. For months since the Taliban's takeover - and the subsequent freezing of the Afghan central bank's reserves abroad - doctors and other healthcare staff throughout the country have not received their salaries even though they have been working full-time. Recently, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) took over salary payments for thousands of health staff - men and women - across Afghanistan. Eloi Fillion, head of the ICRC's Afghanistan delegation, says: 'We've seen over the past months just how dedicated and courageous female health staff have been in showing up and doing their best to save lives every day, regardless of not receiving a salary, of having to travel long distances, working in health facilities that are struggling to function. 'Women are critical in ensuring the health system continues to function. Without them, the health system simply would not work.' Still, many women in healthcare say their futures feel uncertain. 'Most girls in Kabul still aren't attending secondary school, so what opportunities will my daughters have here?' says Faizli, adding: 'Afghanistan is no longer a place where I'm envisioning a future for my children. 'We're running the show at this hospital - and we could do this anywhere. We are leaders - including the future leaders of this country.'

They'll do it for a well-reviewed restaurant, promotional giveaways, or to take an Instagram photo at a popular tourist site. But at 3pm outside a Gongguan pharmacy in Taipei, there's grumbling in the line. It's an inconvenient time to leave work, but for now it's one of the only ways to get your hands on a rapid Covid-19 test. Twenty minutes after the sales window opens, a woman walks out to the waiting customers: they've sold out. People are frustrated, having waited for up to two hours, and some leave to try again tomorrow. Two elderly people lean over a phone, looking at a map for other pharmacies nearby. The pharmacist tells the Guardian that the store is only given 78 tests each day, and always sell out in less than half an hour. She laughs when asked if they can request more.  The disappointed customers rush to another pharmacy, where an employee with a megaphone says there are only tests left for the next four people. When one of those four says they aren't there to buy a test, the woman in fifth place jumps and shrieks with joy. An hour earlier, the central epidemic command centre (CECC) had reported more than 30,000 cases for the previous 24 hours - the first time Taiwan has seen such numbers in this pandemic. Once a poster child for the success of zero-Covid, Taiwan is now dealing with an 'Omicron tsunami'. In response - and in stark contrast to regional neighbours - health authorities have decided zero-Covid is no match for the new variant and have flipped the switch to 'living with the virus'. 'It is the right decision, and it's also the decision we had to make,' says Dr Chen Chien-jen, Taiwan's former vice-president and professor of epidemiology. Taiwan closed itself off in early 2020, and employed a regime of stringent contact tracing, social restrictions and personal hygiene measures which it kept even as vaccines and antivirals were developed. It defeated an outbreak of the Alpha strain and another of Delta in 2021. But after the highly virulent Omicron began affecting countries in November and December, Chen says he and other scholars advised the government to start shifting towards living with the virus. 'The CECC decided we should adopt the policy some time later when booster shots reached around 40-45% [several months away], but Omicron never waits for anyone,' he tells the Guardian. Instead, it began spreading through the community in March. Hong Kong, Taiwan and China were until now the last three major economies still clinging to zero-Covid. In Hong Kong the policy failed and the virus overwhelmed the city with disastrous results. In China, a steadfast commitment to it has produced arduous and economically damaging lockdowns, especially in Shanghai, with no end in sight. Taiwan appears to have seen both options, and decided on a third. It's called the 'new Taiwanese model': an acknowledgment that they can't stop the spread of Omicron, but that they can try - to use an early pandemic-era phrase - to flatten the curve. Cases are still rising and experts predict a peak is three weeks away, with as many as 3.5 million of Taiwan's 24.5 million people expected to eventually be infected, and up to 16,000 dead. As daily tallies ticked past 30,000 this week, the CECC continued to ease restrictions, drop mandatory QR code check-ins, and reduce quarantine times. It urged people to maintain mask-wearing, work from home if they could, reduce gatherings, get vaccinated and take a rapid test if they felt symptoms. It's also trusting people to self-report, and isolate or quarantine at home. So is it working? In many ways, yes. Chen notes the fatality rate of the outbreak is still extremely low, below 0.2%. This year 66 people have died with Covid-19, bringing Taiwan's total to 919 out of more than 345,000 cases. More than 99.75% of Omicron cases are mild or asymptomatic, and residents and businesses are still going about their days without lockdowns or panic. Visitor groups are being gradually allowed to return. Hospitals are not at capacity, thanks to Taiwan pre-emptively ending a policy of mandatory hospitalisation for all cases. The same policy in Hong Kong had filled its hospitals before the wave began, but in Taiwan just 44% of hospital ICU beds (more than 62% in Taipei) were full as of Friday. Prof Yen Muh-yong, the director of the infectious disease department at Cheng Hsin hospital, says Taiwan's diversion of cases away from hospitals has been 'very successful in relieving pressure' so far. But he fears it still won't be enough for this wave and urges more integration of local and district services, to create surge capacity in the workforce and reduce hospital crowds. As cases rise there are also criticisms, including that the government is more reactive than proactive. Yen says transitioning to coexistence was the right decision, 'but the brain is giving directions the hands and feet are not coping with'. 'The government did not plan in advance for the procedures and the preparedness to live with the Omicron tsunami.' Rules and regulations change almost daily and incrementally. The death of a two-year-old boy last month highlighted communication failures exacerbated by Taiwan's entrenched bureaucracy. The child's parents had wanted to send their son to hospital but got conflicting instructions from multiple health services. By the time they got him to hospital it was too late. In factories, migrant workers have once again been discriminated against with unequal rule enforcement and eased restrictions, and poor vaccination rates among the very old and very young remain too low. Many elderly people have refused to get vaccinated against Covid-19, and the government only recently allowed vaccination for under-12s, despite lobbying from anxious parents. Across the capital city, hospitals are reporting crowds of patients who are not sick with Covid. A nurse and anaesthetist at a Taipei hospital tells the Guardian her colleagues are understaffed and overworked, and don't feel well supported. 'Everyone is nervous and they want to have PCR tests so they come to the emergency room, but there are also the patients who need to get more care than other people.' The nurse says there is not enough protective equipment or backup to replace staff who go on leave because they caught the virus, are a close contact, or need to care for family. Instead, they're told to keep working as long as they test negative, and are still subject to a pandemic ban on health workers leaving the country. Chen says authorities are addressing the issues in hospitals, but concedes Taiwan didn't prepare an adequate supply of rapid tests, and still don't have enough despite growing official reliance on them. On Monday, in response to mounting criticism, the government reverted to allowing some retail stores to sell non-rationed tests at market prices, but it didn't have access to brand details or supply levels. There is generally widespread support for Taiwan's efforts. Perhaps one of the biggest hurdles for the 'new Taiwanese model' was to flip the narrative from a fear-filled zero-Covid commitment to gradual coexistence. The lower severity of Omicron has helped, says Chen. Taiwan also came under more pressure to reopen after cautious neighbours like South Korea and Japan joined the US and Europe in opening. Recent polling by the Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation found an almost even split of 45% in favour of a coexistence policy compared to 46.3% who weren't. In July 2021 - at the tail end of the Alpha outbreak - 58.8% of people were worried the government was lifting restrictions too soon. Support for the CECC and minister Chen's handling of Covid has also increased in that time, from 66.4% of respondents to 77.7%. Yen says government messaging has been 'well disseminated and transparent'. 'People are not happy about the deficiencies in testing kit supply, and they are crowding in emergency departments but this can all be improved,' he says. Yen says 'there will of course be casualties', but waiting out the worst of the pandemic until vaccines, treatments and a milder strain came along has brought them a long way. Taiwan is no longer the poster child for zero-Covid, but is hoping it can model something else instead - a calm and steady transition to rejoin the world after more than two years locked away.

The House of Representatives could pass the plan, which exceeds President Joe Biden's request last month for $33 billion, as soon as Tuesday, and Senate leaders said they were also prepared to move quickly, the news agency reports. Biden on April 28 asked Congress for $33 billion to support Ukraine, including more than $20 billion in military assistance.  The new proposal includes an additional $3.4 billion for military aid and $3.4 billion in humanitarian aid, the sources said. A statement released by the White House read: Democrats and Republicans both reportedly said they supported more aid for Ukraine and would approve emergency funding quickly, but it was delayed by disputes between the parties over whether additional funding for Covid-19 relief or stiffer immigration controls should be included. Thank you for following our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This blog has now closed. You can find our latest coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war in our new live blog in the link below. It is just after 8am in Ukraine. Here is a comprehensive rundown of everything you might have missed: Here is a quick snap from White House press secretary Jen Psaki who earlier told reporters that President Joe Biden was not happy with leaks to news outlets in which US intelligence appeared to take credit for helping Ukraine target a Russian ship and Russian generals in Ukraine. Here are some of the latest images showing the continued evacuation of Ukrainian civilians across the country. Removing Russian President Vladimir Putin from power is the only way to protect the west and its allies from future threats from Moscow, Lithuania's top diplomat has said. Lithuanian foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said Putin's annual Victory Day speech was 'underwhelming' and that the 'gloomy faces' of generals and others were signs of failing in the Ukraine war. Yet, he said a wounded Putin may be even more dangerous and that the only way to remove the threat is to remove him in an interview with the Associated Press. Lithuania is one of the three Baltic states that among Nato allies are particularly concerned about possible Russian designs on forcefully returning them to Moscow's rule.  Landsbergis said Lithuania was pleased with the support that its Nato allies have offered to it and the other countries in the alliance's eastern flank, but that they needed more. He said Lithuania, along with fellow Baltic nations Estonia and Latvia, would be pressing Nato to supply more air and maritime defences as well as permanent deployments of troops on their territory when alliance leaders meet in Madrid in late June. The UN Security Council is expected to hold a new public meeting on Thursday on Russia's war in Ukraine, in light of the continuing deterioration of the humanitarian situation, diplomats said Monday. The session, requested by France and Mexico, will be the 16th held by the Security Council since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, as part of an effort by western states to maintain pressure on Russia, Agence France-Presse reports. France and Mexico have requested briefings from the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) and the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef), a diplomat said. The meeting will be held on the same day as an extraordinary session in Geneva of the UN Human Rights Council, requested by Ukraine, on 'the deterioration of the human rights situation in Ukraine.' The new Security Council meeting will follow the adoption on Friday of a unanimous Security Council statement, initiated by Norway and Mexico, giving 'strong support' to the UN Secretary General in his search for 'a peaceful solution' to the conflict. Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the international community to take immediate steps to end a Russian blockade of his country's ports in order to allow wheat shipments and to prevent a global food crisis. Ukraine's major Black Sea port of Odesa for exporting agricultural products was struck by missiles on Monday. Charles Michel, President of the European Council, visited Odesa and said he saw silos full of grain, wheat and corn that was ready for export but blocked. 'This badly needed food is stranded because of the Russian war and blockade of Black Sea ports. Causing dramatic consequences for vulnerable countries. We need a global response,' he said. The president of the European commission earlier hailed the 'progress' made during talks with Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban, who has so far resisted Brussels' plans for a Russian oil embargo. Landlocked Hungary relies on Russian oil from a single pipeline and Orban has warned he cannot approve the European Commission's proposed sixth package of EU sanctions against Moscow. 'This evening's discussion with PM Viktor Orban was helpful to clarify issues related to sanctions and energy security,' von der Leyen tweeted. The two leaders discussed the issue during a meeting in Budapest. 'We made progress, but further work is needed,' she said, adding she would organise a videoconference call 'with regional players to strengthen regional cooperation on oil infrastructure'. Hungarian foreign minister Peter Szijjarto also said the two sides 'made progress' but that they still had plenty to discuss. 'We cannot make the Hungarian people pay the costs of this war,' he said in a video posted on Facebook, according to Reuters. Before the leaders' talks, Orban's international spokesman Zoltan Kovacs, citing Szijjarto, compared the sanctions package to an 'atomic bomb' for Hungary's economy. 'Hungary will not vote for the EU Commission's initiative on sanctions against Russia because it poses a problem for Hungary and does not contain a proposal for a solution,' he tweeted. 'The proposal is like an atomic bomb for the Hungary economy and would destroy our stable energy supply.' European diplomats in Brussels are locked in negotiations on the next series of sanctions against Russia. The draft was drawn up by experts in von der Leyen's commission, the EU executive, but several member states have reservations - most vocally Hungary. The package would have seen most EU members halting oil imports from Russia by the end of the year. Technical talks continue, and negotiators insist there is united EU support behind the need for tougher sanctions, but Hungary and its neighbours need support to ensure alternative sources of fuel. Here is quick visual guide as to what is happening in Ukraine.  Intense fighting is continuing to rage in Ukraine's east, the vital Black Sea port of Odesa in the south came under bombardment again, and Russian forces are seeking to finish off the Ukrainian defenders making their last stand at a steel plant in Mariupol. The White House has dismissed a 'Victory Day' speech by Russian President Vladimir Putin as 'revisionist history' and said his suggestion that western aggression led to the Ukraine war was 'patently absurd.' Speaking to reporters during a press briefing on Monday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Putin's speech was 'revisionist history that took the form of disinformation.' Psaki said 9 May is supposed to be 'about celebrating peace and unity in Europe and the defeat of Nazis in World War Two' but instead 'Putin is perverting history' to justify his unprovoked and unjustified war. It is 'highly likely' that Finland will apply for Nato membership, the Finnish minister for European affairs has said. Tytti Tuppurainen told CNN the decision has not yet been made, but called the nation's likely membership 'a very natural response' to Russia's war in Ukraine. She added that if her country does indeed apply, she hopes 'the ratification process would be as brief as possible.'", "2b6cc38281ba40865c5af03a9d9f1fc07a650eb28ef18f60e69e90b8": "Vladimir Putin has told Russian soldiers they are 'fighting for the same thing their fathers and grandfathers did' as he used his Victory Day speech to justify his invasion of Ukraine. As Putin sought to rally his country through the memory of the second world war, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, pushed back in his own address from Kyiv. 'We will not allow anyone to annex this victory, we will not allow it to be appropriated,' he said. The dual speeches marked a closely watched anniversary in eastern Europe, where Russia has used claims that it is fighting fascism to justify its bombardment of cities such as Mariupol and Kyiv and to launch the largest military campaign in Ukraine since the 1940s.  Prior to the speech, foreign officials had said Putin could use it to launch a full mobilisation of Russian troops or formally declare war in Ukraine, but there were no large policy announcements. Instead he suggested Russia was 'forced' into the war by Nato and pledged to provide aid for the families of soldiers who had died in what the Kremlin is calling a 'special operation'. Speaking at the 77th annual celebration of the defeat of Nazi Germany, the Russian president launched a defence of his war in Ukraine, pivoting from a recognition of Russia's 'greatest generation' to a description of how it was believed Ukraine was being armed by the west for an imminent attack on Crimea, the peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. 'Nato countries did not want to listen to us,' Putin said. 'They had different plans, and we saw it. They were planning an invasion into our historic lands, including Crimea ... Russia gave a preemptive rebuff to aggression, it was a forced, timely and only right decision.' He also described the war as 'sacred'. 'The defence of the motherland, when its fate was being decided, has always been sacred,' Putin said, speaking of the second world war. 'And now, you are fighting for our people in the Donbas. For the security of our homeland - Russia.' Russia provided fewer armoured vehicles than in past years during the Red Square parade on Monday and a planned flyover was cancelled, ostensibly due to weather conditions. Putin did not bring up specific Russian victories in his speech, despite speculation his forces were engaged in a last-ditch effort to secure Mariupol and its Azovstal plant from the remaining Ukrainian defenders by 9 May. Instead, the Russian president addressed troop losses in the war, saying he had signed a new order that would give educational aid to the children of those killed. The Kremlin has been accused of seeking to cover up losses. After the sinking of the Moskva cruiser in the Black Sea, a number of families went public with claims the Russian military was trying to avoid confirming deaths onboard the ship. 'The death of each of our soldiers and officers is a grief for all of us and an irreparable loss for relatives and friends,' Putin said. 'The state, regions, enterprises, public organisations will do everything to take care of such families and help them. We will provide special support to the children of the dead and wounded comrades. The presidential decree on this was signed today.' The muted speech came in stark contrast to that delivered by Zelenskiy, who delivered a recorded address to a piano accompaniment as he walked through central Kyiv past anti-tank barricades. 'This is not a war of two armies,' he said. 'This is a war of two world views. A war waged by barbarians ... who believe that their missiles can destroy our philosophy.' In the speech, Zelenskiy took aim at Russian claims Ukraine had sought to block 9 May celebrations, a focus of Russian state media in advance of the holiday. 'Our enemy dreamed that we would refuse to celebrate 9 May and the victory over Nazism,' said Zelenskiy. 'So that the word 'denazification' will have a chance [to succeed] ... On the day of victory over Nazism we are fighting for a new victory. The road to it is difficult but we have no doubt that we will win. 'And very soon there will be two Victory Days in Ukraine. And some will not even have one left.'  On the ground, meanwhile, intense fighting raged in Ukraine's east, the vital Black Sea port of Odesa in the south came under bombardment again, and Russian forces sought to finish off the Ukrainian defenders making their last stand at a steel plant in Mariupol. More than 60 people were feared dead over the weekend after Russian bombardment flattened a Ukrainian school being used as a shelter in Bilohorivka, an eastern village, Ukrainian officials said.", "7c66273015b54584c465d5d5eeef99fb8e7cd2306e9210ad00fb8a8b": "", "5333b508d4a108f01763d988bf8f6ccbf2fd7130f3552878ab66a0d4": "", "815edf72a6bcf32a5c35434d85f8d48f469510b9b6c4565c9c347d0a": "Scores of inmates are feared dead in Ecuador after a deadly prison riot broke out between rival drugs gangs, in the latest bloody episode of a wave of violence that has engulfed the country's prisons. Forty-three prisoners were confirmed dead on Monday as more than 200 police commandos retook control of the maximum-security wing of the Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas prison, about two hours drive from the capital Quito, but the death-toll is likely to rise. Interior minister Patricio Carrillo told reporters that the majority of the victims had been 'executed with bladed weapons'. It is Ecuador's sixth deadly prison massacre since the beginning of 2021 pushing the death toll to nearly 400 as violence has spiked to unprecedented levels fuelled by rivalry between drug trafficking gangs. More than 300 inmates were slaughtered in the country's prisons last year, including one massacre in Guayaquil's Litoral penitentiary in which 119 prisoners lost their lives. Gruesome images on social media showed mutilated bodies strewn in a courtyard in the jail. Meanwhile, local television broadcast images which have become all too familiar to Ecuadorean viewers, showing dozens of relatives, mostly women, who had gathered outside the jail desperate for news of their loved ones. 'There was really a lot of cruelty,' Ecuador's police chief, Fausto Salinas, told journalists, adding that hand grenades, machine guns, revolvers and ammunition had been found at the jail. Earlier on Monday, he told local television that the immediate trigger for the violence was the transfer of a gang leader from another prison. 'The presence of this person generated conflict and violence,' he said, criticising the judicial authorities who ordered the transfer. This latest massacre is the first large-scale violent incident in the Santo Domingo prison this year. In February 2021, 33 inmates were killed in the same prison, many of them decapitated and dismembered, as part of a simultaneous attack coordinated by criminal gangs in different prisons that left a total of 78 dead throughout the country. Analysts say the spike in prison violence began when local criminal gangs began vying to work with the rival Mexican Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation drug cartels. Ecuador - which sits between Colombia and Peru, the world's two largest cocaine-producing countries - is a strategic smuggling route due to its long Pacific coastline and large shipping and fishing fleets. In the first four months of this year, Ecuadorean authorities have seized 85 tonnes of cocaine, twice the amount seized the year before. Ecuador's president Guillermo Lasso, who was on an official visit to Israel, expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and said: 'This is the unfortunate result of gang violence,' in a tweet.", "0d56a3a7e64d6b022717d9617d29aff5166dcced269c28325515d385": "Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the Democratic Unionist party leader, has rebuffed appeals by the British and Irish governments and said he will block the formation of a new power-sharing administration in Northern Ireland. Donaldson told the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, on Monday that the DUP will not nominate ministers to the Stormont executive later this week unless Downing Street takes 'decisive action' on the Brexit protocol. Such a boycott would trigger a political crisis and paralyse devolved government in the region just a week after Sinn Fein triumphed in an assembly election, making its deputy leader, Michelle O'Neill, the putative first minister. The DUP came second, winning 25 seats to Sinn Fein's 27 in the 90-seat assembly. Under power-sharing rules, the executive cannot form unless the DUP nominates a deputy first minister and other ministers. After meeting Lewis, Donaldson repeated an election campaign promise to disrupt Stormont unless there were changes to the protocol. 'Until we get decisive action taken by the UK government on the protocol, we will not be nominating ministers to the executive,' he said. On Monday night the Times reported that the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, had decided to ditch the protocol after giving up on talks with the EU. Officials working for Truss have reportedly drawn up draft legislation that would unilaterally remove the need for all checks on goods being sent from Britain for use in Northern Ireland. The legislation would also allow businesses in the province to disregard EU rules and regulations and take away the power of the European court of justice to rule on issues relating to Northern Ireland, the paper reported. A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson told the Guardian that no decisions had yet been taken but 'the situation is now very serious'. 'We have always been clear that action will be taken to protect the Belfast agreement if solutions cannot be found to fix the protocol,' they said. The DUP says the protocol, which puts trade checks on some goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain, harms the economy and undermines the region's position within the UK. Only if those problems were resolved could it join an executive, said Donaldson. 'We want to see stable political institutions, we want to be part of the executive, we want to play our part.' Most unionists oppose the protocol but are divided on how to respond. Some favour working with London and Brussels to tweak the agreement. Others advocate obstruction and resistance, a radical strain that has pulled the DUP to a hardline position, leaving it isolated. Lewis, who flew into Belfast from London, delivered a coded rebuke when he urged all the main parties at Stormont to deliver a 'stable and accountable' devolved government. Ireland's taoiseach, Micheal Martin, said Northern Ireland's party leaders had a duty to heed voters who wanted a functional government to tackle crises in the cost of living and health services: 'All of us now have to have due regard to stability within the north, to the full workings of the institutions of the Good Friday agreement.' He told RTE there was a 'landing zone' for compromise on the protocol between London and Brussels. Downing Street has given mixed signals about possible unilateral action. All sides will monitor the Queen's speech at the state opening of parliament on Tuesday for further signals. The EU vice-president, Maros Sefcovic, urged pragmatism. 'We need the UK government to dial down the rhetoric, be honest about the deal they signed and agree to find solutions within its framework,' he said in a statement. O'Neill said the DUP should not try to 'punish the public' for its mistakes on Brexit. 'Brinkmanship will not be tolerated where the north of Ireland becomes collateral damage in a game of chicken with the European Commission. Make no mistake, we and our business community here will not be held to ransom.' Other party leaders echoed the calls for the swift formation of an executive. 'I want us to sit down, get the negotiations under way on the programme for government and the budget,' said Naomi Long, leader of Alliance, which won 17 seats, making it the third biggest party. 'We need the DUP to step up to the plate. You know, with power comes responsibility, and people now need to take the responsibility seriously.' Doug Beattie, leader of the Ulster Unionist's nine assembly members, said problems with the protocol would be resolved only through talks between London and Brussels. 'Northern Ireland has to have a say in that. We'll only have a say if we have a government.'", "a7e9fc46426ea2b299071c49961f30a234ea65493a8c87ec1d8658e2": "Emmanuel Macron has called for a new political organisation to unite democracies on the European continent, as he warned that Ukraine would probably not join the EU for several decades. Speaking two days after being sworn in for a second term as French president, Macron called for big thinking on the future of Europe, saying the war in Ukraine showed the need for a 'historic process of reflection'. He proposed 'a European political community ... a new European organisation [that] would enable democratic European nations who adhere to our values to find a new space for political cooperation', listing security, energy, transport, infrastructure investment and movement across borders, especially for young people, as issues that body would tackle. Being part of this organisation would not exclude a country from joining the EU, and the organisation could include 'those who have left' the bloc, he said. Macron's intervention comes as EU states clash on how quickly to move forward with Kyiv's membership application. The question is likely to reach a crunch point in June, when EU leaders decide whether to grant Ukraine candidate status, a procedural step that normally takes years to attain. Macron suggested he favoured a quick decision on candidate status, while dampening Kyiv's hopes of a speedy entry into the EU. The awarding of candidate status is followed by talks on accession and a process of reform so that a country meets the EU's political, economic and legal criteria. 'Even if we were to give it the status of candidate country tomorrow - I hope we move forward towards accession rapidly - even if we were to do that, we all know only too well the process for accession would take several years; in truth, it would probably take several decades. And that is the truth unless we decide to lower the standards for accession and rethink the unity of our Europe, and also partially the principles that we hold,' he said. 'The European Union, given its level of integration and ambition, cannot be the only way to structure the European continent in the short term.' Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, is championing a speedy processing of Ukraine's membership application, backed by central and eastern European states. Western European members, however, are wary about allowing Ukraine to proceed quickly, fearing Kyiv would not have time to complete vital political reforms, while the process would stoke tensions with six western Balkan countries that have been stuck in the EU membership queue for years. Von der Leyen said Ukraine had submitted a 5,000-page document to Brussels answering questions on its suitability to join the bloc, and in remarks aimed at Ukrainians at an event in the European parliament to celebrate Europe Day, she said: 'The future of Europe is also your future.' Macron also set out goals for the war, saying Europe had 'to do everything to ensure that Ukraine will survive, Russia will never win, preserve peace on the rest of the continent of Europe and avoid any escalation'. Only Ukraine could decide on negotiating conditions with Russia, he said. And he warned against a punitive settlement on Russia when the war is over. 'When peace returns to European soil, we will have to build new security balances and together we must never give into the temptation ... or the desire for revenge, because we know how much that has ravished the road to peace in the past.' The two leaders were speaking at a special session of the European parliament in Strasbourg, where they marked the end of an 11-month citizens' juries project, the Conference on the Future of Europe. At the closing ceremony, EU leaders, citizens and MEPs listened to the EU anthem and watched an interpretative dance routine performed in the aisles of the parliament's debating chamber. Both leaders contrasted the event with the Victory Day commemorations in Moscow. Referring to a woman who appeared with her baby at the Strasbourg ceremony, Von der Leyen said she wanted to celebrate this image on 9 May, 'an image far more powerful than any military parade going up and down the streets of Moscow'. Away from the soaring rhetoric, the citizens project has triggered a row about whether the EU should change its treaties in response to its conclusions - 49 proposals covering the climate emergency, health and young people, among other themes. Von der Leyen said treaty change could not be excluded, while Macron said he supported proposals to convene a convention to revise the treaties. But a group of 13 Nordic, central and eastern European countries hit back at people seeking to 'instrumentalise' the Conference on the Future of Europe, probably a reference to federalists in the European parliament.", "c40f490db434fd905b44212c6740711323e1604e3052f429b2aaec8e": "The Republican governor of Mississippi has refused to rule out attempting to ban some forms of contraception if the supreme court ruling that guarantees the right to abortion should fall. 'That is not what we're focused on at this time,' Tate Reeves said. The ruling, Roe v Wade, seems likely to be overturned this summer, after the leak of a draft supreme court decision supported by five conservatives on the nine-member court. The leak set off celebrations among conservatives and protests among liberals, as a near 50-year battle over a key privacy right approached a decisive moment. Like other states, Mississippi has a 'trigger law' which if Roe falls will outlaw almost all abortions, with exceptions in cases of rape or threat to the life of the mother. The case at issue in the draft ruling, Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organisation, originated in Mississippi. Speaking on CNN on Sunday, Reeves confirmed that his state's trigger law would go into effect if Roe is overturned. Reeves' host on CNN, Jake Tapper, then referred to neighbouring Louisiana, where Republicans have advanced a bill to make abortion a crime of murder. Tapper said: 'They're talking about not only criminally charging girls and women who get abortions as committing homicide, but they're also talking about defining the moment of conception as fertilisation, which would theoretically ... mean if you use an IUD [intrauterine device], you are committing murder. '... I'm not making this up. These are the conversations going on in legislatures in your area. So, just to be clear, you have no intention of seeking to ban IUDs or Plan B [morning-after pills]?' Reeves said: 'That is not what we're focused on at this time. 'We're focused on looking at - see[ing] what the court allows for. The bill that is before the court is a 15-week [abortion] ban. We believe that the overturning of Roe is the correct decision by the court. And so, in Mississippi, we don't have laws on the books that would lead to arresting individuals or anything along those lines.' Asked if that meant he would arrest doctors who performed abortions, Reeves said: 'I don't think that you're going to see doctors performing abortions if we have a state statute which says that they're not allowable, except for those exceptions that we have mentioned earlier.' Reeves also said: 'I believe that life begins at conception. 'And as I have said repeatedly - and I know where this question is ultimately going with respect to birth control and other measures - I want to be clear. My view is that the next phase of the pro-life movement is focusing on helping those moms that maybe have an unexpected and unwanted pregnancy. 'The next phase of the pro-life movement is making sure that those babies, once born, have a productive life. And while I'm sure there will be conversations around America regarding [contraception], it's not something that we have spent a lot of time focused on.' Democratic New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand told CNN she was 'pretty offended by [Reeves'] remarks. 'He doesn't look at women as full citizens,' Gillibrand said. 'He's taken away their right to make these fundamental decisions about when they're having children, under what circumstances they're having children, how many children they're having, at what point in their life they're having children. 'It's outrageous that this governor and governors and legislatures across America are going to take this draft opinion, when it is final, and deny women these fundamental life-and-death decisions about their future and about their families.'", "40c251f9d56ee9477e07c044430215f63dc37ffdb1f4438d84a304a1": "A Texas woman got a bang for her buck when her purchase of a $34.99 marble bust from a Goodwill thrift store turned out to be a relic from ancient Rome. Laura Young, who has been reselling antiques for 11 years, came across a 52lb marble bust in an Austin Goodwill in 2018. 'I was just looking for anything that looked interesting,' Young told CNN. She added: 'It was a bargain at $35 - there was no reason not to buy it.' After purchasing the bust, Young reached out to various auction houses and experts to find out more about the sculpture. A specialist used a digital database to track down the bust's provenance and found photos from the 1930s featuring the head in Aschaffenburg in Bavaria, Germany. Sotheby's eventually confirmed that the bust was estimated to be about 2,000 years old, and came from ancient Rome. Furthermore, the bust probably belonged to Roman military leader Sextus Pompey, according to San Antonio Museum of Art postdoctoral fellow Lynley McAlpine. Pompey's father was Pompey the Great, a political ally turned enemy of Julius Caesar. The bust was once kept at Pompejanum, a replica of a Pompeii-style Roman home that was commissioned by King Ludwig I and built in the 1840s. Pompejanum displayed the bust until the second world war, when groundskeepers placed the sculpture and other relics in storage as the villa came under attack. For about the next 80 years, the bust's whereabouts were unknown - until Young dug it up at a Goodwill. 'It seems like sometime between when it was put into storage until about 1950, someone found it and took it,' McAlpine told CNN. 'Since it ended up in the US it seems likely that some American that was stationed there [during the war] got their hands on it.' Young tried to track down the person who donated the bust through Craigslist but was unsuccessful. 'I would really love it if whoever donated it came forward,' she told CNN. 'It's most likely not the original person who took him, but [I] would still like to know the story.' The San Antonio art museum was loaned the bust for a year, but the piece still technically belongs to Germany because it was stolen from storage. Germany anticipates getting the bust back in May of next year and then displaying it once again in the Pompejanum.", "5651d5e0c3e7d2a40cdc4fc234d05f85b97bf8979ce8fd22738b5152": "Keir Starmer has pledged to resign as Labour leader if he is fined for breaching Covid rules by taking part in a gathering in Durham last year in which he and other party activists ate takeaway food and drank beer on a campaigning trip. His deputy, Angela Rayner, who also attended the event, said she would also resign if she was found to have broken the rules by Durham police, who last week started a new investigation into the event, which occurred on 30 April 2021. Starmer said he was determined to prove he had 'different principles to the prime minister', who has already been issued with a fixed-penalty notice for breaching lockdown rules in Downing Street. The Labour leader said he was determined to prove no rules were broken. 'The idea that I would casually break the rules is wrong. I don't think those who are accusing me of it believe it themselves ... They are trying to say all politicians are the same.' In a statement at Labour HQ, he said: 'If the police decide to issue me with a FPN, I would of course do the right thing and step down ... The British public deserve politicians who think the rules apply to them.' After hours of agonising with key aides, Starmer said he intended to draw a distinction with Boris Johnson's approach. 'I stand for honour and integrity, and the belief that politics is a force for good, and we shouldn't all be dragged down by this cynical belief that all politicians are the same. And I am here to make it clear that I am not the same,' he said. 'We are not all the same. I am different.' Starmer said it had been entirely his decision, amid reports he had come under pressure to make the declaration. 'This is my decision about what is the right thing to do in these circumstances,' he said. 'This is about me. It's about what I believe in in politics. It's about integrity, and I believe in integrity, and integrity requires me to take the course of action I have set out if, in the event, I get a fixed penalty notice.' . Starmer had called on both Johnson and Rishi Sunak to step down after the prime minister and chancellor were among those fined for being at a lockdown-breaching birthday celebration for Johnson in Downing Street in June 2020. Rayner put out her own statement on Monday afternoon confirming she would also resign if the rules were found to have been broken. 'I've always been clear that I was at the event in Durham working in my capacity as deputy leader and that no rules were broken. Eating during a long day's work was not against the rules,' she said. 'We have a prime minister who has been found to have broken the rules, lied about it and then been fined. If I were issued with a fine, I would do the decent thing and step down.' Earlier on Monday Starmer pulled out of a speech at the Institute for Government as he wrestled with how to respond to the renewed pressure on him over the conduct at the gathering in Durham of Labour aides, some of whom were reported to have been drunk. The pressure from the scandal has caused some despair among Labour MPs for preventing the party from capitalising on local election results and key airtime ahead of the Queen's speech on Tuesday. 'We've lost hugely valuable time to make our case for what we would be doing in government by cancelling this speech - all because Keir is yet again unable to be bold,' said one MP who counselled in favour of Starmer saying he would be prepared to resign. Mary Foy, the Labour MP for the City of Durham, in whose constituency office the lockdown meal took place, denied the reports on Monday that some staff had been drunk. 'These allegations about my staff are untrue,' she said in a statement. Starmer has a loophole where he could potentially be criticised by Durham police but not fined - an approach they took after an inquiry into alleged lockdown breaches by Dominic Cummings, who was then the prime minister's senior aide. Answering questions from the media, Starmer indicated that he would not necessarily step down if police did not fine him, but said the event could have breached rules. 'The penalty for a Covid breach is a fixed-penalty notice,' he said when asked about that situation. 'That's a matter of law. And I've set out what the position is in relation to that.'", "c627ed652204812b3f74eadd66fb879c43c0092a144f026e4c33bdd0": "", "3162069976d74fdc4d140c7f48175618c052a7037c353bd9bf346490": "", "c3f405bbec2bc4c5fa492394bb4c6a7dd3a092b63f3050378b1b64c9": "", "123f16de1405aad4f40466109f081206cf978babec9365071e1d692d": "", "177dde57c792044c4daf5ee94fd57faba1953795f43f757cfc8ebe26": "", "f16d982cce902121e45c574674ded3512df475e59a7ff149e80dc68d": "", "9917396a6217be81554d8c66e241eb6425084948a4f9bb718e896a62": "Sri Lanka's prime minister, Mahinda Rajapaksa, has resigned after months of protests over the country's deepening economic crisis, as once-peaceful protests turned violent and at least five people were killed in clashes. Turmoil began to engulf the country on Monday following violence at a major protest site in Colombo, where pro-government supporters attacked peaceful demonstrators and police responded with teargas and water cannon. The violence quickly spread across the country. Houses and vehicles of several pro-Rajapaksa politicians and the residence of Mahinda Rajapaksa were set on fire. A nationwide curfew was imposed but five were killed and almost 200 injured. In one incident just outside of Colombo, a politician from the ruling party opened fire on anti-government protesters blocking his car, killing a 27-year-old, and then later took his own life. According to police, another ruling party politician opened fire on protesters in the southern town of Weeraketiya, killing two and wounding five. Mahinda Rajapaksa had been asked to resign by his brother, the president, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, at a special meeting on Friday, in an attempt to appease demonstrators who have been taking to the streets in their thousands since March. Protesters have been calling for both members of Sri Lanka's powerful Rajapaksa political dynasty to be removed from office for mishandling the economy and plunging the country into the worst financial crisis since independence. Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was president for a decade between 2005 and 2015, had reportedly been resistant to stepping down, but on Monday submitted his letter of resignation to the president. 'Multiple stakeholders have indicated the best solution to the present crisis is the formation of an interim all-party government. Therefore, I have tendered my resignation so the next steps can be taken in accordance with the Constitution,' he wrote. The resignation is the latest concession made by the Rajapaksas in the face of protracted anger and protests. The president recently agreed to repeal an amendment to the constitution which had concentrated power in his hands and hand power back to the parliament. Other members of the Rajapaksa family who had previously held seats in the cabinet have also stepped down, with the president the only remaining member of the political family still in power. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, known widely as Gota, has repeatedly said he will not resign as president, despite the clarion call of the protests being 'Gota go home'. The resignation of Mahinda Rajapaksa means the government will be dissolved. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who remains as the executive, is expected to invite members of all political parties to form a cross-party cabinet, described as a 'unity government', in an effort to implement some political stability amid the widespread anti-government unrest. The Rajapaksas have largely controlled Sri Lankan politics for two decades, but the economic crisis has rattled their grip on power in the face of mass unrest from those who had previously been supporters of their brand of chauvinist nationalist politics, which pandered to the country's Sinhalese Buddhist majority. Sri Lanka's foreign reserves have dropped so low that the country cannot afford to import basic essentials, leading to shortages of fuel, food and medicines. People have been forced to endure daily power cuts of up to 10 hours, fuelling mass protests across the country since March. Over the weekend, the president declared a state of emergency in the country, the second in recent weeks, in a bid to regain control over the streets. However, Monday marked a violent shift in the demonstrations when hundreds of pro-government supporters gathered outside the prime minister's residence in Colombo and urged Mahinda Rajapaksa not to resign. The group, some armed with sticks and wooden bars, then launched an attack on an anti-government protest camp nearby, with police reportedly looking on as the clashes began. Police deployed teargas and water cannon, and around 180 were taken to hospital with injuries. Army and paramilitary troops were deployed to the site and a curfew was declared in the area. The incident was a catalyst for violence which spread first through the city and then across the country, as the homes and cars of several lawmakers, including Mahinda Rajapaksa's residence in the city of Kurunegala were set on fire. Gotabaya Rajapaksa tweeted: 'Strongly condemn the violent acts taking place by those inciting & participating, irrespective of political allegiances. Violence won't solve the current problems.' However, many were quick to point out that the attacks had been prompted by Rajapaksa supporters. The US ambassador to Sri Lanka condemned 'the violence against peaceful protesters today, and [called] on the government to conduct a full investigation, including the arrest and prosecution of anyone who incited violence'. The economic situation in Sri Lanka remains dire, with the country virtually bankrupt. It has already defaulted on its billions in foreign loans and is in discussions with the International Monetary Fund for an emergency loan and financial assistance to get the country back on its feet.", "f6036416148e7fce4a47cb5c5aa17540273cb1e54863888c6548522d": "Latin America's largest city, Sao Paulo, is reportedly planning to open a campsite for rough sleepers in response to a Covid-fuelled homelessness crisis that has forced thousands on to the streets. The homeless population in Brazil's economic capital, which has about 12 million residents, grew by more than 30% during the coronavirus pandemic in what activists have called a humanitarian emergency. On Saturday morning one of Sao Paulo's 31,000-plus homeless residents stood outside the city's Museum of Sacred Art with a tatty sign that spoke to the scale of the social catastrophe. 'Estou comendo do lixo,' it read. 'I'm eating from the trash.' According to a report in one local newspaper on Monday, the city hall is now planning to create a campground where Sao Paulo's homeless can erect tents and be given access to bathroom and laundry facilities. 'The mayor has said that, given the acuteness of the city's circumstances, money would not be an obstacle,' the city's new human rights and citizenship secretary, Soninha Francine, told the Folha de Sao Paulo. Francine said it was an emergency that so many families were having to sleep rough because they could no longer afford to pay rent or for cooking gas. Official statistics reveal a dramatic situation in Brazil's biggest city: according to Sao Paulo's city hall, there were people living in tents and wooden shacks in nearly 6,800 different areas last year, compared with only about 2,000 two years earlier. Their inhabitants reportedly include a growing number of women, families and elderly citizens. Speaking in Sao Paulo on Saturday, Brazil's former left-wing president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva denounced the social calamity blighting the country he governed from 2003 to 2011, with inflation soaring and 12 million unemployed. 'Hunger has returned,' said Lula, as he announced his intention to challenge the incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro, in October's presidential election. Brazil's hunger crisis was exposed last year by heart-wrenching photographs of down-and-outs scavenging through a heap of animal carcasses in a middle-class Rio de Janeiro neighbourhood, just a few minutes' drive from its most famous beaches. 'A governor who is incapable of shedding a single tear when there are humans rummaging through rubbish trucks for food, isn't worthy of the title,' Lula said on Saturday, in reference to those shocking images. Brazil is not the only Latin American country grappling with the social fallout from a coronavirus pandemic that has plunged millions of citizens back into extreme poverty. The number of people living in extreme poverty in Latin America and the Caribbean rose from from 81 million to 86 million between 2020 and 2021, according to the United Nations.", "3431c750f150988d31ed23433c8c741e87361359277b856f5c8a4bba": "An experimental cancer therapy that infuses designer immune cells into patients has shown early promise in a clinical trial by shrinking tumours in the digestive system. Interim results from the first phase of the clinical trial found that the tumours in nearly half - 48.6% - of the 37 patients treated so far reduced in size after the therapy. While the findings come from an initial safety assessment of the approach, researchers running the trial in Beijing believe it demonstrates the potential for genetically altered immune cells to treat advanced gastrointestinal cancers. So-called Car T-cell therapy takes white blood cells, or T cells, from patients and modifies them so that they can recognise and kill cancer cells. The approach has met with dramatic success as a treatment for blood cancers such as leukaemia, but solid tumours have proved more difficult to target. Writing in Nature Medicine, researchers led by Dr Lin Shen at the Peking University Cancer Hospital and Institute describe how they made Car T cells that target tumours bearing a protein called CLDN18.2. The protein is found in many cancers, but particularly in gastrointestinal tumours. The researchers infused Car T cells into 37 patients with advanced cancers of the stomach, digestive tract or pancreas and found that while all experienced side-effects, the therapy had an 'acceptable safety profile'. The treatment seemed most effective in those with stomach cancer, with more than 57% responding to the infusions. The scientists stress that the findings need to be verified in the complete trial, but say the interim results suggest the approach 'has the potential to become an important treatment modality for patients with advanced gastric cancer'. About 6,500 people are diagnosed with stomach cancer in the UK each year, roughly half of whom are over 75. Waseem Qasim, professor of cell and gene therapy at the Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street hospital, who works on Car T-cell therapies, said the preliminary results were promising. 'The report provides some strong hints that engineered Car T cells can help shrink gastric cancers, in this case by targeting a particular flag on the surface of cells. As for other advanced solid cancers, achieving complete remissions is challenging, but the experiences shows there is potential for interventions that redirect the immune system against cancer,' he said. Prof Charles Swanton, Cancer Research UK's chief clinician, said: 'Car T-cell therapies, which harness modified versions of our own immune cells to fight cancer, have so far had limited success in solid tumours, which make up most cancers. So it's particularly promising to see these results, which show a high percentage of people with digestive cancers seeing the benefits of treatment last beyond six months. 'This is encouraging, as people with digestive cancers have very few treatment options. The study is still at an early stage, and larger-scale clinical trials will need to be done before Car T-cell therapies can be used routinely in this setting.'", "17752a5d63791b5842aa3d51f77634e5a9b85cf2c8b80e15c31695ec": "The last civilians rescued from the besieged Azovstal steel plant complex in Mariupol reached safety in Ukrainian held territory late on Sunday evening. The convoy arrived in the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia after dark, carrying about 170 evacuees. There were 51 civilians who had been sheltering in the Azovstal complex, and about 120 others who had walked or hitched lifts across the city to a pickup point in a ruined shopping mall. The journey of just over 200 kilometres took two days, as the convoy of buses was held for hours at Russian checkpoints and the hungry, weary residents inside interrogated. 'I didn't think we would make it out alive, so I don't have any plans for my future,' said Natalia, who worked at the Azovstal plant all her adult life and then sheltered for over two months in its network of bunkers. She had fled with little more than a collection of drawings made by children in their shelter; she had organised drawing competitions to occupy them and kept the pictures to remember. 'I wouldn't have given them up even if they shot me.' Ukraine's Deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on Saturday that 'all women, children and elderly' had come out of the complex and were being evacuated. About 36 hours later the group filed slowly off the buses into the late evening dark, and fell upon a hot meal prepared in the registration tent. It also had clothes and toys, as most people fled with just a couple of bags. 'It is a breath of fresh air to be on Ukrainian-held land,' said Tatiana, who fled with her daughter and granddaughter. Many children and elderly people were among the exhausted-looking arrivals. 'I just want to live and start again ... everything I have is here,' said Yegor Chekhonadsky, pointing to a cluster of bags at his feet. He, his wife and two sons had sheltered at Azovstal since early March. 'Of course I'm overjoyed, and happy to be in Ukraine.' Mariupol has endured the most destructive fighting of the 10-week-old war. The plant is the last part of the city - a strategic southern port on the Azov Sea - still in the hands of Ukrainian fighters. Scores of civilians were trapped for weeks alongside them in the plant with little food, water or medicine. Pascal Hundt, the head of delegation for the ICRC in Ukraine said the group 'have all endured a level of horror no human should have to go through.' The operation began on 5 May, the third safe passage coordinated in recent days, but around 2000 soldiers - many of them injured - are thought to remain trapped. Earlier on Sunday, the remaining Ukrainian fighters at the plant vowed to continue their stand as long as they are alive. 'We don't have much time,' Captain Sviatoslav Palamar told an online news conference, pleading with the international community to help evacuate wounded soldiers.

The parade comes two days after Russian forces bombed a village school in eastern Ukraine killing about 60 people, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. The governor of the Luhansk region said about 90 people were sheltering at the school in Bilohorivka on Saturday when it was bombed. 'As a result of a Russian strike on Bilohorivka in the Luhansk region, about 60 people were killed, civilians, who simply hid at the school, sheltering from shelling,' Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. There was no response from Moscow to the news. Putin, Russia's leader since 1999, has in recent years used Victory Day to needle the West from a tribune in Red Square before a parade of troops, tanks, rockets and intercontinental ballistic missiles. This year, a fly-past over the nine domes of St Basil's Cathedral will include supersonic fighters, strategic bombers and, for the first time since 2010, the Il-80 'doomsday' command plane, which would carry Russia's top brass in the event of a nuclear war. Putin has repeatedly likened the war in Ukraine - which he wrongly casts as a battle against dangerous 'Nazi'-inspired nationalists in Ukraine - to the challenge the Soviet Union faced when Adolf Hitler invaded in 1941. 'Our common duty is to prevent the renaissance of nazism which has brought so much suffering to people of different countries,' Putin said in a message to the peoples of 12 former Soviet republics including Ukraine and Georgia. Ukraine and its allies reject the accusation of nazism in Ukraine and that Russia is fighting for survival against an aggressive West, saying the Kremlin leader unleashed an unprovoked war in an attempt to rebuild the Soviet Union. Putin, who has repeatedly expressed resentment over the way the West treated Russia after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union, says Ukraine has been used by the United States to threaten Russia. US president Joe Biden has cast Putin's invasion of Ukraine as a fight in a much broader global battle between democracy and autocracy and has repeatedly called Putin a war criminal. In a speech in Warsaw in March Biden said the former KGB spy cannot remain in power. Russia denies Ukrainian and western accusations that its forces have committed war crimes since the 24 February invasion. A day before the symbolic Victory Day parade, the Black Sea city of Odesa came under repeated missile strikes. In Mariupol, the remaining Ukrainian fighters in the Azovstal steelworks in the besieged port city staged a press conference on Sunday saying they had been 'abandoned' by the government as Russian attacks continued. Serhiy Gaidai, the Luhansk governor, where the bombed school was located, told the Guardian he believed the 30 people who escaped had been outside in the grounds of the building. He said he had little hope for those who were under rubble. 'Unfortunately, they are probably dead,' he said. 'Because the building collapsed. Besides, an air bomb is not a missile, its explosion produces extremely high temperatures. That's why most likely people haven't survived.' Putin has stated he intends to take the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions by 9 May when Russia marks Victory Day. In an address to mark Ukraine's 8 May remembrance and reconciliation day, Zelenskiy said his country paid homage to all those who helped defeat Adolf Hitler and accused Russia of repeating his crimes. He said: 'Every year on 8 May, together with the entire civilised world, we honour everyone who defended the planet from nazism during world war two. Millions of lost lives, crippled destinies, tortured souls and millions of reasons to say to evil: never again! 'We knew the price our ancestors paid for this wisdom. We knew how important it is to preserve it and pass it on to posterity. But we had no idea that our generation would witness the desecration of the words, which, as it turned out, are not the truth for everyone. 'This year we say 'Never again' differently. We hear 'Never again' differently. It sounds painful, cruel. Without an exclamation, but with a question mark. You say: never again? Tell Ukraine about it.' Zelenskiy went on: 'On 24 February, the word 'never' was erased. Shot and bombed. By hundreds of missiles at 4am, which woke up the entire Ukraine. We heard terrible explosions. We heard: again!' Illya Samoilenko, a lieutenant in the Azov regiment in Mariupol, said his fellow soldiers would be executed if captured by the Russians and that surrender would be a 'gift' to the enemy. 'We are witnesses of Russian crimes,' he said, from the city's Azovstal steelworks. 'Surrender is not an option because Russia is not interested in our lives.' Meanwhile, the last civilians rescued from the besieged complex reached safety in Ukrainian held territory late on Sunday evening. The journey of just over 200km took two days, as the convoy of buses was held for hours at Russian checkpoints and those inside interrogated.

Ben Wallace is also expected to accuse President Putin of hijacking the annual commemoration of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany - and to say the country's senior politicians and generals are complicit. 'Through their invasion of Ukraine, Putin, his inner circle and generals are now mirroring the fascism and tyranny of 70 years ago, repeating the errors of last century's totalitarian regimes,' Wallace will say in a speech at the National Army Museum in London. 'Their unprovoked and illegal invasion of Ukraine, attacks against innocent citizens and their homes, and the widespread atrocities - including deliberately against women and children - corrupts the memory of past sacrifices and Russia's once-proud global reputation.' Soldiers and tanks not fighting in Ukraine will parade through Moscow and other Russian cities on Monday for the annual Victory Day parades, events that have taken on an increasing importance during Putin's 20 years in charge. But Wallace is expected to say that it is the presence of army generals that is particularly inappropriate, because they allow the Kremlin to make a false equivalence between the anti-fascist struggle of the second world war and the unprovoked attack on democratic Ukraine. 'Let's call out the absurdity of Russian generals - resplendent in their manicured parade uniforms and weighed down by their many medals - for being utterly complicit in Putin's hijacking of their forebears' proud history of defending against a ruthless invasion; of repelling fascism; of sacrificing themselves for a higher purpose,' the defence secretary is expected to say. Professional soldiers should also be appalled at the behaviour of Russia's army, Wallace will add. Moscow's forces have been accused of repeatedly bombing civilians, while failing to achieve the military objectives that had been set. 'Not only are they engaged in an illegal invasion and war crimes, but their top brass have failed their own rank and file to the extent they should be court-martialled,' he will say. Russia's military has become bogged down in Ukraine after more than two months fighting, including an aborted attempt to capture the capital Kyiv, and are trying to mass forces in the east to make territorial gains in attritional fighting in the Donbas region.", "a3cce6eaba2a1fcb260cde729d0b2577531ec97c995e915620c06bd7": "The US first lady, Jill Biden, made an unannounced visit to western Ukraine on Sunday, holding a surprise Mother's Day meeting with the nation's first lady, Olena Zelenska, as Russia presses its punishing war in the eastern regions. The US president, Joe Biden, has not visited the country, though he expressed a desire to when he was in Poland this spring, following Russia's invasion in February, but at that time Russian tanks were advancing on the capital, Kyiv, and he hinted that his security advisers held him back. Jill Biden traveled under the cloak of secrecy, becoming the latest high-profile American to enter Ukraine during its 10-week-old conflict with Russia. Russian forces drew back from Kyiv in the weeks after Joe Biden's trip to Poland, and the return of a greater level of security in the capital prompted visits by the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, days after the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, and other world leaders, including the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, had met there with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. 'I wanted to come on Mother's Day,' Jill Biden told Olena Zelenska on Sunday. 'I thought it was important to show the Ukrainian people that this war has to stop and this war has been brutal and that the people of the United States stand with the people of Ukraine.' The first lady traveled by vehicle to the town of Uzhhorod, about a 10-minute drive from a Slovakian village that borders Ukraine. The two came together in a small classroom, sitting across a table from one another and talking in front of reporters before they met in private. Zelenska and her children have been at an undisclosed location for their safety. Zelenska thanked Biden for her 'courageous act' and said: 'We understand what it takes for the US first lady to come here during a war when military actions are taking place every day, where the air sirens are happening every day - even today.' The school where they met has been turned into transitional housing for Ukrainian migrants from elsewhere in the country. The visit allowed Biden to conduct the kind of personal diplomacy that her husband would like to be doing himself. The White House said as recently as last week that the US president 'would love to visit' but there were no plans for him to do so at this time. On Sunday, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, also made a surprise visit to Ukraine and was expected to meet with Zelenskiy. Earlier, the meeting between the two first ladies came about after they exchanged correspondence in recent weeks, according to US officials. Biden drove through Uzhhorod and the meeting between the women lasted about an hour. Her visit was limited to western Ukraine. Russia is concentrating its military power in eastern Ukraine, and she was not deemed to be in harm's way. Earlier, in the Slovakian border village of Vysne Nemecke, she toured its border processing facility, surveying operations set up by the United Nations and other relief organizations to assist Ukrainians seeking refuge. Biden attended a religious service in a tent set up as a chapel, where a priest intoned: 'We pray for the people of Ukraine.' Before that, in Kosice, Biden met and offered support to Ukrainian mothers in Slovakia who have been displaced by Russia's war and assuring them that the 'hearts of the American people' are behind them. At a bus station in the city that is now a 24-hour refugee processing center, Biden found herself in an extended conversation with a Ukrainian woman who said she struggles to explain the war to her three children because she cannot understand it herself. 'I cannot explain because I don't know myself and I'm a teacher,' Victorie Kutocha, who had her arms around her seven-year-old daughter, Yulie, told Biden. At one point, Kutocha asked, 'Why?' seeming to seek an explanation for Russia's decision to invade Ukraine on 24 February. 'It's so hard to understand,' the first lady replied. Meanwhile, the top American diplomat in Ukraine, acting ambassador Kristina Kvien, temporarily returned to the US embassy in Kyiv, according to an unnamed US official, weeks after it was vacated.", "4763e115c2a0d1ac8fe5a639ccda1eddeb3303c1675b728b6e4d7a5a": "Members of Ukraine's Azov battalion trapped inside Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant have said they fear they will be killed if captured by Russian forces, as they pleaded with Ukrainian authorities to help arrange their extraction. Speaking to the media from inside the besieged steelworks, an Azov commander and lieutenant, looking gaunt and pale, said they had defended the city for the people of Ukraine and the rest of the world and needed a third party to negotiate their exit whether by land or sea. There are believed to be 2,000 soldiers in the plant, 700 of whom are said to be wounded. Lieut Illya Samoilenko vowed to fight on, saying his comrades understood they would be killed if captured and that surrender would be a 'gift' to the enemy. 'We are witnesses of Russian crimes,' Samoilenko said. 'Surrender is not an option because Russia is not interested in our lives.' All the civilians who were inside the plant have been evacuated, according to Azov's commander, Denys Prokopenko. 'We need the proper opportunity to be evacuated,' Svyatoslav Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov regiment. 'Another thing that hurts is that the politicians said you continue (fighting) while we evacuate the civilians. But we (are) here defending the people.' They criticised the Ukrainian government for celebrating the evacuation of several dozen civilians over the past few weeks, while failing to prepare Ukraine over the past eight years for what they say was an inevitable war with Russia. 'The government let this happen to 25,000 people,' said Samoilenko, speaking of the number of civilians in Mariupol that he estimates have died. Azov forces say they are more than 100km from the nearest Ukrainian forces and cannot make it to safety without help from Ukraine's authorities. The Azov battalion has been central to Russia's justification for invading Ukraine. Russia claims its members are neo-Nazis who are responsible for 'Nazifying' Ukraine. Azov fighters say its membership holds a range of political opinions. Azov formed as a volunteer battalion in 2014 to fight Russian-backed forces and some its leaders are known to hold far-right views. But since 2015, it has been part of the Ukrainian army and no longer attracts only far-right combatants. Russian propaganda has long exaggerated the domestic influence of Azov in Ukraine as well as the scale of its membership. Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine has worked to transform the image of the fighters internationally and in Ukraine. Many now view them as heroes. Samoilenko said they felt supported by words but asked for aerial attacks on Russian positions and berated the Ukrainian authorities for not defending Ukraine's southern regions. 'We are doing our job and we are doing our job well. Some of the politicians are not doing their job well,' said Samoilenko, who also said Azov had killed 2,500 Russian soldiers from 24 February to 25 April. Samoilenko said the weak reaction of the world to Russian aggression in 2014 is one of the reasons why this invasion had happened. He said western countries should have understood that the price of prosperity in Europe had been 15,000 Ukrainian lives in the last eight years, referring to the 2014-22 war, when he said the west had refused to help the battalion. 'We showed that anything is possible,' said Samoilenko. 'Please do your job and so we can teach people how to do impossible things.' Samoilenko also criticised the Ukrainian government for negotiating with Russia, describing them as 'barbarians'. He said Azov's goal was to eliminate the enemy threat by pacifying Russia and that they were not only fighting for Ukraine but the whole of the free world. Samoilenko declined to say how many soldiers were left in the plant or talk about their supplies, saying that this was classified operational information. The fighters say morale is still high, despite coming under almost constant shelling. 'We're grateful for the support from the world and this may help,' said Samoilenko 'People have seen who we are.'", "ad87113db60e19085a5110822755cf07709db42dc553dc5a2e8aa685": "Ukraine will prevail over Russia as freedom prevailed over the Nazi dictatorship in 1945, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will say in a TV address to mark the 77th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day, in which he will accuse Vladimir Putin of falsifying history. In the speech, which will be aired on German TV at 8.20pm CET (7.20pm BST) on Sunday, Scholz says the 'legacy of 8 May' for his country must be to help to ensure that there will never again be genocide or tyranny in Europe. 'I am deeply convinced. Putin will not win the war,' the centre-left politician says. 'Ukraine will prevail. Freedom and safety will win, just like freedom and safety triumphed over servitude, violence and dictatorship 77 years ago.' Scholz says it is 'falsifying history and disgraceful' of Russia's president to equate his own 'barbaric war of aggression' with the fight against National Socialism. 'It is our duty to state this clearly,' his speech says. In keeping with previous postwar German leaders' messages on 8 May, Scholz thanks the Allied forces for their defeat of Nazi Germany, and says his country owes a debt to both Russia and Ukraine, which suffered millions of casualties in the second world war. Scholz has repeatedly declared Germany's support for Ukraine's defensive effort but diplomatic relations between Berlin and Kyiv have been frosty. Ukrainian diplomats have accused his left-liberal coalition government of stalling over embargoes on Russian energy and deliveries of military hardware. The chancellor, meanwhile, appeared personally piqued after Germany's president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, previously a Social Democratic party (SPD) ally, was told last month he was not welcome to visit Kyiv along with eastern European leaders. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said last week he had made up with Steinmeier and invited Scholz to pay a symbolic visit to Ukraine's capital on 9 May. The German leader did not give any indication on Sunday of whether he was likely to accept or not. Several European politicians have visited Ukraine since the start of the war in late February, including the leader of the German parliamentary opposition. Canada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau, made a surprise visit to Irpin on Sunday, and the US president's wife, Jill Biden, met Ukraine's first lady, Olena Zelenska, during an unannounced visit to the west of the country. In what she called an 'icebreaker' visit, the president of the Bundestag, Barbel Bas, also travelled to Kyiv on Sunday to commemorate the victims of the second world war, laying wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier with her Ukrainian counterpart, Ruslan Stefanchuk, the chair of the Verkhovna Rada. 'To me this day is special because it does not merely commemorate but should serve to reconcile,' said Bas, whose presiding role over sessions in Germany's legislature is comparable to that of the speaker in other parliaments. The SPD politician said her visit was meant to commemorate all victims of the second world war, those in Ukraine as well as Russia, Poland, Belarus, the Baltic States and other states in central and eastern Europe. Public figures in Berlin, meanwhile, stayed away from gatherings to mark the anniversary of Nazi Germany's surrender over fears that commemorative events could be used for propaganda purposes. 'The situation is very oppressive, and any commemorations have to take that into account,' said Berlin's mayor, Franziska Giffey, justifying her and her senators' absence at the traditional laying of wreaths at the Soviet War Memorial in the city's Treptower Park. The Russian embassy in the German capital, which has organised the event in the past, has not made its plans public this year because of security concerns. Germany's surrender is traditionally celebrated in western Europe on 8 May, but because time zones it is marked on 9 May in Russia, Belarus, Serbia and Israel. Berlin's senator for interior affairs, Iris Spranger, said police would seek to suppress any public displays of support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 8 and 9 May, including the beeping of horns at car rallies. About 1,000 people attended a pro-Russia rally at Cologne's Fuhlinger lake on Sunday, waving the red-white-and-blue flag of the modern Russian republic and the red flag of the former Soviet Union. The display of Russian flags in the vicinity of 15 memorial sites in Berlin was banned. The city's decision to also include Ukrainian flags in its ban has been heavily criticised by the country's ambassador to Germany. Andrij Melnyk said the ban, which exempts flag displays by diplomats, was 'a slap in the face of the Ukrainian people'.", "6cdd855979dc4c8e2f5bfb44433df497c4b40489f930a4808a22104d": "Ferdinand Marcos Jr appears on track to become the next president of the Philippines, as initial vote counts showed a significant lead for the son and namesake of the late dictator who ruled the country for more than 20 years. A partial and unofficial count based on 61.05% of the election returns showed Marcos Jr in the lead with 20m votes on Monday evening. His nearest rival, the vice-president and former human rights lawyer Leni Robredo, was on 9.5m votes, according to data released by the commission on elections. It is not clear which areas of the country have been counted, and if these are Marcos strongholds. Opinion surveys in the run-up to the vote suggest Marcos Jr, known as Bongbong, will win the election, despite his family's history of human rights abuses and corruption. The Marcoses plundered as much as $10bn from the state, while thousands of his opponents were arrested, tortured and killed. His biggest threat is Robredo, the current vice-president, who has campaigned promising good and competent governance. Robredo, who worked as a human rights lawyer before entering politics, has been a staunch critic of the outgoing president, Rodrigo Duterte, criticising his bloody 'war on drugs', his Covid response and warning against populist leaders. People began lining up to vote before polling centres opened at 6am on Monday morning, while others waited more than four hours in the heat. The vote follows three months of fierce campaigning, in which 2 million Robredo volunteers launched an unprecedented door-to-door campaign to try to win over voters and counter an onslaught of online disinformation that has sought to portray the rule of Marcos as a golden era. Social media has been inundated with false stories about the Marcos regime, claiming it was a prosperous and peaceful time, and seeking to brush aside the atrocities and corruption. 'This is not just an election to determine our future. It's an election that will determine the correct version of our past,' said Aries Arugay, a visiting fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, who is based in Manila. 'If Marcos Jr wins, they will literally wipe out that version, that collective memory.' Outside Santa Ana elementary school, in a residential area of Manila, people sheltered from the heat under umbrellas as they made their way to vote. Delia Ong, 71, a part-time real estate broker, said she was backing Robredo. 'She is really gifted, talented, she is bright. She is not just famous for the name; she is self made,' said Ong. Robredo had been proactive in helping poorer communities, she said, citing her reputation for visiting deprived areas and helping victims of natural disasters. Marcos Jr was 'no brains, but has money', she added. Marcos Jr's candidacy has polarised opinion. Some reject outright that the family plundered money, despite courts at home and abroad ruling they possessed ill-gotten wealth.Raquel Deguzaman, 59, who works as a photocopier, said she supported Marcos Jr and did not believe the family was corrupt. '[Marcos Sr] was able to help the Philippines. He's really good,' she said, adding that he had built infrastructure, including hospitals. It is not likely that martial law, which was imposed by Marcos Sr in 1972, would happen again, but if it did, it would help stop crime, she said. 'There's no discipline, just pure robbery, holdups,' said Deguzaman. Arugay said the vote was a referendum on Duterte's 'strongman rule, populist, authoritarian kind of leadership', adding: 'You can really say that Marcos Jr somehow typifies that - or even typifies a worst version of it.' Duterte has not endorsed a presidential candidate. However his daughter, Sara, who is vying for the vice-presidency, is running in tandem with Marcos, creating a formidable partnership of two of the country's most powerful political families. While Marcos traditionally has support in the north, the Dutertes are popular in Mindanao and parts of the Visayas. Marcos Jr, whose slogan is 'together we shall rise again', has campaigned with a message of unity and rekindling a former greatness. He has not apologised for his family's political history. Opinion surveys suggest Marcos Jr is far ahead of his opponents. One recent poll found he was the preferred candidate of 56% of respondents. Robredo, behind him, is favoured by 23%. Robredo's campaign has gathered momentum in the run-up to the election, with large crowds attending her rallies and young voters volunteering to go door to door to win support for her campaign. Many people turning out to vote were doing so for the first time, said Ivan Mirasol, 28, a data analyst, who was voting with his father in Santa Ana. 'Because we want the change that we have been really yearning for several years already.' 'Number one, she has a good track record. Number two, she doesn't have any taint of corruption,' added Mirasol. Others are not convinced. Mar Escandor, 61, who was also on his way to vote, said he was done with the Marcoses, but did not support Robredo. 'I don't like female presidents. Very weak,' he said. Escandor was backing Isko Moreno, who grew up in and is now mayor of Manila. Moreno, a former actor, is popular in Manila but trailing in the polls along with the boxing star Manny Pacquiao and Panfilo Lacson, a 73-year-old former national police chief. Polls officially closed at 7pm local time (1200 BST), but voters within 30 metres of precincts will still be allowed to cast their ballot, election officials said. About 67 million people are eligible to vote. The winner will take office on 30 June and lead for a single, six-year term.", "c17f70a9203ed0f2ade63dea3966309dabc252c68ea5f82e68c1da4f": "Barclays has avoided nearly PS2bn in tax via a lucrative arrangement in Luxembourg that allowed it to pay less than 1% on profits in the tax haven for more than a decade. A Guardian analysis of Barclays' tax bills shows it is still benefiting from a controversial decision in 2009, in which it booked profits from the $15.2bn sale of a fund management business in Luxembourg rather than in the UK where it is headquartered. By booking the profits overseas, Barclays was able to take advantage of a complex scheme whereby it could offset future profits against a drop in the value of company shares it acquired as part of the deal. The decision has resulted in Barclays earning billions of pounds nearly tax-free for more than 12 years, and has raised questions about whether it influenced the bank's strategy in investing or growing the Luxembourg business at the expense of other locations, including the UK. The senior Labour MP Margaret Hodge said: 'These revelations that Barclays is using a scheme in an infamous tax haven leaves the British-headquartered bank with important questions to answer. 'Why is Barclays setting up shop in Luxembourg at all, other than to avoid tax? Does this artificial financial arrangement mean that profits are shifted away from the UK, thus harming our tax coffers? Or have business investments been channelled through this tax haven instead of in Britain, harming our economy in the process?' Barclays employs only 54 staff in Luxembourg, but it is currently the bank's third most profitable jurisdiction behind the US and UK, with turnover of PS1.1bn last year. Low staff costs mean Barclays can turn nearly all of that income from corporate and investment banking into profit. The bank has 46,000 staff in the UK and nearly 10,000 in the US. Cumulatively, Barclays' Luxembourg operations have made PS6.6bn in profits since 2013, according to annual tax documents released by the bank. Thanks to the generous tax arrangement, it has paid only PS46m on those earnings, or about 1%. Barclays could have been taxed between 25 and nearly 30% had it not taken advantage of rules allowing it to offset losses linked to $9bn-worth of shares acquired through the sale of its Barclays Global Investors (BGI) business to the US fund manager BlackRock in 2009. It means the bank could have saved PS1.8bn in tax over the period, though the collective savings are likely to be much higher because it only started releasing country-by-country tax information in 2013 in response to EU rules. Reuters first revealed the tax arrangement in 2016, but the extent of the benefits were not known. Barclays has not referenced the BGI deal by name in its annual tax reports, but has said for years that its low tax bills are because of previous losses. 'We paid no corporation tax in Luxembourg in 2021 as our taxable profits were offset by substantial tax losses brought forward from prior years, and also due to dividend income not being taxable under Luxembourg law', its 2021 report stated. 'We have unused tax losses which are automatically carried forward, and available to offset against future taxable profits.' Barclays said in a statement: 'The structure of the BGI sale was not aimed at securing a tax reduction but intended to secure a simpler and more certain tax treatment and avoid volatility in the bank's regulatory capital.' It said it had not booked any profits from other jurisdictions in Luxembourg, and stressed that it paid more than PS14bn in taxes in the UK over the past decade. Barclays' Luxembourg operations, which were established in 2007, have courted controversy before. The bank's former chief executive Antony Jenkins pledged to shut down a unit in the Grand Duchy that helped wealthy customers avoid tax in 2013. At the time, the bank was reporting profits of around PS1.4bn, about PS100m for each of the 14 people employed there. The winding down of the unit resulted in a drop in local profits in subsequent years, falling as low as PS318m in 2018. Barclays, however, announced fresh investment in 2019, helping profits rebound to more than PS1.1bn by 2020. It involved expanding services for its multinational clients, despite its staff base only increasing to just over 50 employees. Today the bank offers a range of services out of Luxembourg, which it said was focused on serving local clients and offering cash management, debt, foreign exchange and trade finance.", "f32847687ff1ec8fe43c9567a93410ead3240890412a704ceb0ea519": "", "e7ba5c7649cdf6938542f962f84d8b51bbb71f2925bfb81d0539e8ad": "The Democratic Unionist party is to seek an urgent meeting with Boris Johnson to warn him it will stall power-sharing at Stormont until Christmas if the Northern Ireland protocol is not modified. A senior party figure said it will push the responsibility for Stormont back on to the prime minister: 'We will say he has a choice: Stormont or the protocol.' The ultimatum came as the UK justice secretary, Dominic Raab, pledged to do 'whatever necessary' to alter the protocol, which mandates checks on goods crossing into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. But the DUP's trust in the Conservative party, which was already at a low ebb, was shattered last week when the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, hinted the government was pulling back from threats to introduce laws to unilaterally disapply parts of the protocol. Lewis will meet with the leaders of Northern Ireland's political parties on Monday. 'We have to address the outstanding issues relating to the Northern Ireland Protocol, and we want to do that by agreement with the EU, but as we have always made clear, we will not shy away from taking further steps if necessary,' he said in a statement. 'However, the people of Northern Ireland need a stable and accountable government that delivers on the issues that are important to them. That is why we urge the parties to come together and form an Executive.' The party's leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, will lay out his concerns in a statement on Tuesday following the Queen's speech in the House of Commons. The Queen's speech is expected to include a commitment to protect the interests of the unionist community and the Good Friday agreement, but the DUP says it will not go as far as it wants. The re-elected DUP MLA for Upper Bann, Jonathan Buckley, told the Belfast Telegraph on Sunday that Lewis also needed to take responsibility for changing the protocol: 'Either the secretary of state wants an executive or the protocol, he can't have both.' Lewis has said he will meet all the Northern Ireland party leaders in the coming days but the DUP will stick to its position that it has support for a boycott of Stormont and only an intervention by London can restore power-sharing. 'We can stall this until Christmas,' said one senior DUP insider. The party argues that despite the surge in support for Sinn Fein in last week's election, the majority of Stormont seats (35) have gone to unionist parties - 25 to the DUP, nine to the UUP and one to the Traditional Unionist Voice party. Doug Beattie, the Ulster Unionist leader, said he had been invited to meet Lewis on Monday and expected the Stormont assembly to resume work this week regardless of the formation of an executive. 'I expect all our MLAs to be there. We have a lot to be getting on with.' Claire Sugden, an independent unionist who held her seat in East Derry, said she favoured forming an executive as soon as possible. 'I appreciate there are issues with the protocol but I want to see an executive now, up and running.' The protocol was not a constitutional issue but a logistical one that required fixing, she said. Sugden said she would not join any party at Stormont, adding: 'The people elected me as an independent.' There has been speculation the DUP might try to co-opt independent unionist MLAs to overtake Sinn Fein's numerical superiority. One insider in Belfast said the party required substantial reform of the protocol, with one of their MPs warning they needed to see all the European court of justice's role extinguished - which was previously a sticking point in negotiations with the EU. 'All the energy in unionism right now is on the right and is demanding serious changes.' DUP insiders say they will press home to the prime minister that new laws designed to prevent a future collapse of the assembly also give it the power to delay formation of the executive for up to six months. Under legislation passed in February the parties have six weeks following the opening of the assembly to form an executive. If they fail to do so they can be given three further six-week extensions. If there is no executive by the end of the 24 weeks, then the Northern Ireland secretary must call an election, which must be held within 12 weeks. The deputy leader of the centrist Alliance party, Stephen Farry, which more than doubled its seats in the assembly election, could prove an ally to the DUP. Farry said at the weekend it had to be recognised more widely that the protocol needed to be changed, but he called for a 'pragmatic approach' with all parties working together in Stormont rather than another showdown with Brussels.", "598f758486c2b6aa42212d257cb68e5b3bb64dee2fea6f6de43ef9ab": "Carolyn Egan has seen people cross the Canada-US border for abortions - going north to south. In the years before Canada's supreme court legalised abortion in 1988, it was common for Canadians who needed abortions to travel to the US. 'We had a network of people who could make referrals and help them get there [to the US]. If it's necessary, that probably would happen again - but the other way,' said Egan, spokesperson for the Abortion Rights Coalition of Canada. If, as a leaked draft decision indicates, the US supreme court votes to overturn Roe v Wade, many Americans in need of surgical abortion could be forced to travel not just across state lines but, once again, across international borders - both along the northern border to Canada and the southern one to Mexico. On Tuesday, Canada's minister of families, Karina Gould, reaffirmed that Americans can access abortion services in Canada. 'If they, people, come here and need access, certainly, you know, that's a service that would be provided,' she told CBC News. An estimated 26 states are likely to ban abortion if Roe v Wade is overturned, according to the Guttmacher Institute, an American sexual and reproductive health rights research organization. That includes Michigan, which sits across the water from southern Ontario, where there are plenty of abortion clinics. 'If a state like Michigan banned abortion, certainly there would be interest in coming across the border,' Egan said. Michigan has a 1931 ban that could automatically kick in when Roe v Wade ends. Michigan residents could also travel to Illinois or Pennsylvania, as those states are unlikely to outlaw the procedure, according to Guttmacher data, and many Americans would be expected to travel internally between states. Those travelling internationally won't find it free - people without immigration status in Canada are charged about C$500 (US$388) for a surgical abortion, Egan said - but Americans do not need a health card to access clinics in Canada. Wait times vary, from one to two weeks in Ontario to several weeks or months in the Atlantic provinces. Crossing the border will probably only be possible for those who can afford to do. Abortion advocates in the US have underscored that after Roe v Wade falls it will be wealthier white women who have the means - including travelling - to access abortion, while people on lower incomes and those who face socioeconomic barriers including African American, Latino and Indigenous women and transgender people may struggle more. 'You have to have the financial resources' to travel between states or internationally, Meghan Doherty, director of global policy and advocacy at Action Canada for Sexual Health and Rights, said. 'There will be a limited number of people who will be able to do that.' She added that not everyone has dependable childcare, the ability to take time off work or a valid passport. The cheapest option early in pregnancy will probably continue to be abortion pills, obtainable either through the mail or via telehealth services. But after working for more than 10 years at clinics in Ireland while abortion was illegal, Doherty says she has no doubt that people will cross borders. 'Over 5,000 women a year travelled to the UK, so we know that abortion restrictions don't stop women from accessing abortion - it just places more burden on them.' South of the US border, Mexican advocates are preparing for an increase in Americans visiting to access abortion services. In 2021, Mexico's supreme court ruled it was unconstitutional to criminalise abortion, although access still varies by state.  The advocacy group Las Libres is part of a network that helps people on both sides of the border access abortion pills. Vero Cruz, advocacy coordinator with Las Libres, said Americans can technically obtain surgical abortions in public clinics in certain Mexican states for free, though she doesn't know of anyone who has done so yet. Cruz said surgical abortions were available in Sinaloa, Coahuila and Baja California, but only up to 12 weeks of pregnancy. 'The women who are crossing into Mexico are coming to Monterrey, Tijuana and other cities to have abortions using medication,' she said. The abortion pills are free, too. 'It's completely free, it costs nothing.' She said both private and public clinics in border cities in Mexico were planning for an American influx; both Tijuana and Coahuila recently set up services, she said. Egan said Americans in Canada will be warmly received, too. 'For a cabinet minister to say that Americans would be welcome here, gives the sense that the government is considering the possibility, and making it clear they would not be interfering in that.' Many Canadians are upset about the looming end of Roe v Wade, she said. 'There's tremendous upset, distress and anger that Americans would be in the situation of having to face this kind of thing. So my sense is people will do everything they can to make access easier.'", "349d538671666071364bde59ff630decd85dd33569c63edfacc00de0": "Labour has rejected claims that a leaked planning memo about Keir Starmer's visit to Durham last year undermined his assertion he did not break lockdown laws, insisting he is 'Mr Rules'. The Labour document, published by the Mail on Sunday, shows that an 80-minute dinner with the Labour MP Mary Foy, featuring a takeaway curry, was planned as part of his schedule. Starmer has repeatedly claimed that the meal, at which he was pictured drinking beer, did not break lockdown rules because he was eating in the course of work, and not attending a social event. The announcement by Durham police on Friday that they were reopening their investigation into the event has led Tories to accuse the Labour leader of hypocrisy as he called for Boris Johnson's resignation when police opened an investigation into lockdown breaches at No 10. Tories argued the memo was evidence the meal was in breach of lockdown rules because it showed that it was prearranged - to take place between 8.40pm and 10pm - and not just a spontaneous decision to order food as work extended into the evening, as Starmer's account of the evening has implied. Starmer has also claimed that after his meal he continued working. But the leaked schedule showed that after the meal he was due to return to his hotel. In a separate report, the Sunday Times quoted an unnamed source who was present at the gathering saying Starmer did not return to work after his meal and that Foy and her staff were not present for work purposes, but just for a drink. 'Mary Foy and her staff were not working and I have not got a problem telling that to the police. They were just getting pissed. They were just there for a jolly,' the source told the paper.  Foy said: 'Me and my team were working during a very busy period. Including facilitating the leader's visit. I do not believe either I or my office broke any rules and I will of course fully engage with any police investigation.' In a tweet at the weekend, Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, claimed the memo showed Labour's account of the evening was 'a lie'. Dominic Raab, the justice secretary and deputy prime minister, told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday that Starmer was guilty of 'rank double standards'. Lisa Nandy, the shadow levelling up secretary, told the same programme the leaked memo confirmed Starmer was on a work visit when he was in Durham on 30 April 2021. She said Starmer was the victim of 'an absolutely desperate attempt to sling mud' and that it was 'absurd' to equate this with a prime minister under investigation for 12 separate gatherings, including 'karaoke parties, bring your own bottle parties, pub quizzes [and] suitcases full of wine being smuggled through the back door'. She added: 'The prime minister lied about that ... Keir Starmer went on a work visit and had a break to eat. The idea that this is the same sort of thing is just a sign of a government that is tired, and is desperate and is completely out of ideas. 'This is a guy who's self-isolated six times during the pandemic, I don't know a single other person who did that. 'He is Mr Rules, he does not break the rules, he was the director of public prosecutions, not somebody who goes around tearing up rules when it suits him, in stark contrast to the prime minister.' Adam Wagner, a human rights barrister and a specialist in lockdown rules, said the Labour memo could be used to clear Starmer of allegations he broke the law.  'Seeing that this was a scheduled event as part of the leader of the opposition's visit to Durham - during a local election campaign, an event focused on him being with a local MP and their staff, and it was in the evening and food was ordered because it was the evening - I don't really see how it could be a breach of the regulations,' he said. 'The regulations allowed for any gathering that was reasonably necessary for work or voluntary activity. And obviously the purpose of that visit overall was for the leader of the opposition to visit the local campaigners and the local MP and that is all on the schedule. 'So the police would have to say: 'Well we actually disagree with the Labour party's analysis of what was reasonably necessary for the leader's trip to Durham,' and I am doubtful that they could really go behind that reasoning.' Wagner said the No 10 Partygate events were quite different. 'The issue with the Downing Street events was that they were prearranged social events. Those being investigated are the ones where it's quite obvious that the purpose of the event was social - a Christmas party, a leaving party, a birthday party. Whereas the fact that this is pre-planned I think shows the opposite. It shows that the purpose was political.'", "9875fbb22ac103a8a30d11fac1cec8a9df2eaa02cd51f7d8d340aeac": "The UK is under pressure to insist India release Jagtar Singh Johal, a British citizen, after a UN working group ruled he had been arbitrarily detained by India and his detention lacked any legal basis. Boris Johnson apparently raised the case when he met the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, last month and provided a written note of consular cases, but Foreign Office ministers have not confirmed whether they regard his detention as arbitrary. Johal was arrested after his wedding in the Punjab in November 2017, accused of helping to fund a Sikh-on-Hindu assassination plot - something that he and his family strongly deny. In what is being described as a watershed moment in the case, the UN panel on arbitrary detention concluded that the 'continued pre-trial detention of Mr Johal lacks legal basis, and is arbitrary' because he was abducted by plainclothes officers without an arrest warrant, held incommunicado and denied consular assistance or access to a lawyer. They observe that there is 'no judicially admissible evidence against Johal, despite intelligence agencies having over three years to investigate' and conclude that 'the appropriate remedy would be to release Johal immediately'. Johal has claimed he was tortured and forced to sign blank confession statements, and then had extra charges laid against him that had now reached a total of nine cases. He was transferred to Nabha maximum security prison, where he remained until 25 May 2019, before being transferred to a prison in Delhi. The UN report says that despite being in jail for more than four years he has not been charged and no admissible evidence has been produced. The report by the UN working group on arbitrary detention claims 'Johal was targeted because of his activities as a Sikh practitioner and supporter and because of his activism writing public posts calling for accountability for alleged actions committed against Sikhs by the authorities'. It adds that he 'was deprived of his liberty on discriminatory grounds, owing to his status as a human rights defender and based on his political activism, religious faith and opinions'. The Indian government denies torture, and says it is still compiling evidence in the cases. Jagtar's brother Gurpreet Singh Johal, who has been fighting for his release, was elected a Labour councillor in the Scottish local elections in Dunbarton last week. He said: 'We've known from the start that there's no good reason for Jagtar's imprisonment and in four years the Indian authorities haven't produced any evidence against him. The UK government hasn't listened to us, but perhaps it will listen to the UN and call for his release. There have been so many setbacks but on a day like this, we're dreaming of the moment my brother steps off a plane in Scotland to be reunited with his family.' The co-executive director of the human rights group Reprieve, Maya Foa, said: 'This is a watershed moment. There is no longer any excuse for the government's continued failure to call for Jagtar's release and return. When a British citizen is tortured and held in pre-trial detention for four years, facing a potential death sentence, the prime minister's responsibility is clear. What is Boris Johnson waiting for?' The Foreign Office says it has raised the case more than 70 times at various levels and that the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has offered to meet the family to discuss the case.", "e0fd2b7ed8ef18f17b5e4e8daf910463f1e7f4c626ae4b57c9e4f992": "The New York Times has removed the word 'fetus' from its Wordle answers to keep the game 'distinct from the news', a move apparently related to last week's leaked Roe v Wade supreme court draft ruling. The change caused confusion as it was only implemented for some of the game's players.  'Today, some users may see an outdated answer for Wordle that seems closely connected to a major recent news event. This is entirely unintentional and a coincidence - today's original answer was loaded into Wordle last year,' the New York Times  said in a statement. The game's answer-list is pre-written and assigned to a date. 'When we discovered last week that this particular word would be featured today, we switched it for as many solvers as possible,' the newspaper said. The Times acquired Wordle earlier this year after it became a viral hit. The switch away from the word appears to be a move by the Times to avoid using a politically-charged term. Last week's leaked supreme court draft majority opinion supported overturning the landmark Roe v Wade decision, putting in jeopardy rights to abortion across the United States and sparking a bitter national debate. 'At New York Times Games, we take our role seriously as a place to entertain and escape, and we want Wordle to remain distinct from the news,' the Times said.  It's not the first time Wordle has offered up different solutions. In March, baffled users tweeted their confusion over two correct Wordle answers. In that instance, the solution could be either 'harry' or 'stove'. In that case the Times confirmed the answer had been changed as it removed potentially obscure or insensitive words 'in an effort to make the puzzle more accessible'. When the Times acquired Wordle  it also removed words such as 'lynch,' 'slave' and 'wench'.", "7159a9c5770af835ae72b3b12e742d46230865eca2c7bb3230be74d9": "", "0f10dc6a0dd46c6a9b1139871dc67c814cf3706bdf936af8806f95e5": "", "4702300cbecc484328d95a14a88d8f530b25e0725614131791aa63e8": "", "087bf827efecf2cc4fe885f45721c3e5e9b0e7ee8fdbaf794ccd2984": "", "ad4e1fb6c0c43fdba39dd1aefb903d7b43525e6a87b8e170a1885f94": "", "4f5482ec85abc4f74e48cdb20d08b58874014682bcc1cb4376823721": "", "d161dd88be1473cda4ec70b971f6fcd07397700a0081101cb2b4a816": "", "784519b935b513c880ebc93900174f491f897ace74eecef50bd2ca78": "", "385271ea98be9745f1a46abf210dd0934ae9086ef52544d80939c464": "", "26f07c33fe1be23e84e27ec5ef87280557062b8fadd31e7f4472ee01": "", "bc21c59a7b369f5d021f551f5dfdd36ff044a552a82071def1241665": "", "bd8b312b0d2cc5f40439538fb844ff910457032a8ec9b22d3ae089a7": "", "7ba1a87b7ff02f90e553f34cc9ce77107fa47e7d73306437e151c20a": "", "42526d8e126dc6727ff2b73f04dca5e9c2ce842f291c50e8b1ccc141": "", "f4fb19b9209ce3c0cdc97ef8146576f39c3ef182236194c5aa84fa36": "The RSPB is urging the public to get their hands dirty this weekend and create mud pies to help endangered birds such as house martins, swifts and swallows get enough sludge to build their nests. A nine-day mini-heatwave is hitting the UK, which coincides with the return of migratory birds here to breed. Many of these birds have flown thousands of miles on their journey. But conservationists are concerned that the ground is getting so hard it could stop them from being able to make their nests. By leaving out dishes of mud mixed with water, or creating little puddles in the garden, the public can make a big difference, said Becca Smith, of the RSPB. 'It's the easiest thing that people can do to help these birds after they've flown all the way from Africa to our shores. Plus, a bit of mud pie-making is fun for the weekend.' Putting out dishes of fresh water will also provide drinking and bathing for a variety of birds. House martins - which require the most mud for nestbuilding - can mix water with soil themselves, which they then combine with things such as grass, feathers and vegetable fibres to make little cup nests under the eaves of houses. 'Having the mud already created for them is the easiest option for these birds,' said Smith. 'It's a bit like getting a McDonald's as opposed to having to go out and get all the ingredients yourself and trying to recreate a Big Mac.' Mud pies should not be too sloppy, but also should not dry out. Smith recommends checking them a couple of times a day to make sure they are still wet enough. She says it's good to leave birds water and mud every year between March and May, especially if it is dry, because this is a very busy time of year for them. Some migratory birds have arrived later this year because there have been persistent easterly and north-easterly winds, which make it harder for them to fly northwards. According to Marco Petagna at the Met Office, UK temperatures are 'several degrees above where they should be at this time of year'. In December 2021, swift and house martins joined the UK red list of endangered birds in the latest IUCN update. Swift populations have fallen by 58% since 1995. These migratory birds have suffered from the loss of nesting sites as old buildings are renovated, and also the loss of insects - their food supply. A UK study this week found flying insect numbers have plunged by 60% since 2004. The RSPB also recommends putting up artificial nests and boxes to provide more nesting opportunities for these birds, as well as creating insect-friendly gardens. Alexander Lees, senior lecturer in conservation biology at Manchester Metropolitan University, said the RSPB's recommendations look useful. 'More broadly, we need building regulations that mandate spaces for swifts and house martins, and to make sure that any nest boxes are cited appropriately on cooler and shady north or east-facing walls,' he said. 'Given that the loss of insect abundance is likely to be strongly affected by artificial light at night, then we can all make the effort where possible to turn lights off, saving insects, their predators and saving on our energy bills. We need to stop stealing the darkness from the natural world.'", "ef18261099e4391ed4dba60f17f932b6f5c2aba833c7262f802219cc": "Scientists studying the DNA of the world's smallest cetacean and rarest marine mammal, the vaquita porpoise, have made a surprising and bittersweet discovery. With a tiny population of fewer than 10 individuals left, the mammal was assumed by conservationists to be at a similar risk of harmful mutations and inbreeding as other species with small gene pools. However, a team of international researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries (NOAA) and other institutes found that the porpoises (Phocoena sinus) have fewer harmful mutations and are thus likely to be better at avoiding the perils of inbreeding, relative to other species. Unfortunately for the animals, which have a very small geographical range and only live in the upper part of the Gulf of California, between Baja California and Mexico, the biggest threat it faces is illegal fishing with gillnets - flat nets suspended vertically in the water that are notorious for also trapping whales and turtles. If that does not stop immediately, experts say, the species is unlikely to survive. Christopher Kyriazis, a UCLA doctoral student in ecology and a co-lead author of the research, said: 'Interestingly, we found the vaquita is not doomed by genetic factors, like harmful mutations, that tend to affect many other species whose gene pool has diminished to a similar point. Outlawed fishing remains their biggest threat.' The small porpoises, about 1.2-1.5 metres (4-5ft) long, often become entangled and die in the large mesh gillnets poachers use to hunt the totoaba, an endangered fish that fetches thousands of dollars on China's black market for its perceived medicinal properties. While Mexico has banned totoaba fishing and the use of gillnets in the vaquita's habitat, many say the ban is not always enforced. The researchers analysed the genomes of 20 vaquitas that lived between 1985 and 2017, and used models to predict its extinction risk over 50 years. They concluded that if gillnet fishing ended immediately, the vaquita had a very high chance of recovery from its population crash, without suffering the genetic consequences of inbreeding. If, however, the practice continues, even moderately, the prospects of recovery are less optimistic. The research is being published in the journal Science. Kirk Lohmueller, senior co-author and UCLA associate professor of ecology, said: 'A prevailing view in conservation biology and population genetics is that small populations can accumulate deleterious mutations. However, our finding that the vaquita likely has fewer strongly deleterious mutations hiding in the population means that they are better poised to survive future inbreeding, which bodes well for their overall recovery.' The vaquita's small population and habitat make it the marine equivalent of an island species, the researchers said. The population has plummeted from 576 to seven or eight over the last decade, due to the rise in the illegal totoaba trade.", "97e1404d0b7bfb05e7af576c67ac8c41773f304ade7270d832fc7f53": "A Nasa climate research scientist who has spent much of her career explaining how global food production must adapt to a changing climate was awarded the World Food prize on Thursday. Cynthia Rosenzweig, an agronomist and climatologist, was awarded the $250,000 prize in recognition of her innovative modeling of the impact of climate change on food production. She is a senior research scientist at the Nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies and serves as adjunct senior research scientist at the Columbia Climate School at Columbia University, both based in New York. Rosenzweig, whose win was announced during a ceremony at the state department in Washington, said she hopes it will focus attention on the need to improve food and agricultural systems to lessen the effects of climate change. 'We basically cannot solve climate change unless we address the issues of the greenhouse gas emissions from the food system, and we cannot provide food security for all unless we work really hard to develop resilient systems,' she told the Associated Press during an interview ahead of the ceremony. Jose Fernandez, the undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy and the environment, said more than 160 million people worldwide experienced food insecurity last year, a 19% increase over the year before, and one of the root causes is a decline in food production due to global warming. 'Climate change has already had a significant and negative impact on global agricultural production and its impact is only going to get worse. We're seeing rice fields drown in floods. We're seeing other crops wither in drought. We're seeing shellfish die in more acidic oceans and crop diseases are spreading to new regions. We likely would not understand all these problems as well as we do today without the work of Dr Cynthia Rosenzweig, this year's World Food prize laureate,' he said. The Des Moines-based World Food Prize Foundation award recognized Rosenzweig as the founder of the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project. The organization draws scientists from around the world and from many disciplines to advance methods for improving predictions of the future performance of agricultural and food systems as the global climate changes. The foundation credited her work with directly helping decision-makers in more than 90 countries establish plans to prepare for climate change. In her work, Rosenzweig has studied how farmers can deal with climate change and how agriculture worsens the problem. For example, she contributed to a research paper published last month that said global agri-food systems create nearly one-third of the total global greenhouse gases emitted by human activity. Rosenzweig said the world needs to reduce such emissions and adapt to the changing climate. She noted that greenhouse gases come from many parts of food production, including the release of carbon and carbon dioxide through the clearing of forests for farmland and the oxidization of carbon through the plowing of fields. The use of fertilizer also releases atmospheric nitrous oxide, farm equipment emits fossil fuels and cattle release methane. Rosenzweig, who describes herself as a climate impact scientist, grew up in Scarsdale, New York, a suburban area that she said led her to seek out life in the country. She moved to Tuscany, Italy, with her husband-to-be in her 20s and developed a passion for agriculture. Upon returning to the United States, she focused her education on agronomy. She worked as a graduate student at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in the early 1980s, when global climate models were beginning to show the effects of human generated carbon dioxide on the global climate. As the only team member studying agronomy, she researched the impact on food production and has been working since then to answer those questions, she said. Rosenzweig's work led to the Environmental Protection Agency's first projections of the effect of climate change on the nation's agricultural regions in the agency's assessment of the potential effects of climate change on the United States in 1988. She was the first to bring climate change to the attention of the American Society of Agronomy and she organized the first sessions on the issue in the 1980s. She completed the first projections of how climate change will affect food production in North America in 1985 and globally in 1994, and she was one of the first scientists to document that climate change was already affecting food production and cultivation. The research organization she founded, AgMIP, develops adaptation packages, which could include the use of more drought-tolerant seeds and improved water management practices. In Bangladesh the group is working with rice farmers to develop new practices for managing rice paddies to reduce the significant release of methane produced by the existing process. She said even the largest agribusiness corporations have shown a willingness to listen. She said some models colleagues have developed show how businesses could be effected by climate change and how they too have a role to play in reversing impact on climate. 'It's really a global partnership of all the global food system to come together to restrain climate change and maintain the food security for the planet,' she said. The World Food Prize Foundation president, Barbara Stinson, who announced the winner, credited Rosenzweig for innovations that helped countries respond to climate change. Nobel prize laureate Norman Borlaug created the World Food prize in 1986 to recognize scientists and others who have improved the quality and availability of food. Rosenzweig will receive the award and make a speech during an October ceremony in Des Moines.", "5fc8c284423dc20c900a3f39c7f2811026143743d4d630cbd0b2acc3": "Two Palestinians believed to have killed three people in a terrorist attack on Israel's independence day - the latest incident in the worst wave of attacks in Israel in years - have been apprehended by police after a three-day manhunt. The suspects, identified as As'ad Yousef As'ad al-Rifa'i, 19, Subhi Emad Subhi Abu Shqeir, 20, both from the occupied West Bank village of Rumana, were caught near a quarry outside the town of Elad in central Israel on Sunday, according to a statement by Israel's police, military and internal security agency. A massive search to locate the pair had been under way since Thursday night, when two attackers armed with an axe and knife stabbed people during independence day celebrations in Elad, an ultra-Orthdox town. Israeli media identified those killed as Yonatan Havakuk, Boaz Gol and Oren Ben Yiftah, fathers in their 30s and 40s who together are survived by 16 children. Four more people were injured. Ben Yiftah, a driver, was hired to pick up the assailants near a breach in Israel's West Bank security fence without knowing they had crossed the barrier illegally, Israeli officials said last week. On arrival in Elad, they killed him before moving on to target passersby. The perpetrators then fled the scene, sparking a huge search operation involving special forces, commando units, drones and helicopters, before they surrendered to masked soldiers in a rugged patch of land outside the town early on Sunday. A spate of deadly street attacks targeting Israelis, accompanied by violent clashes at al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem between Palestinian protesters and Israeli police, have sent tensions soaring in recent weeks. Eighteen Israelis, including an Arab-Israeli police officer and two Ukrainian nationals, have been killed in five separate incidents. Three Arab-Israelis and 27 Palestinians have died during the same period, among them an unarmed woman and two apparent bystanders as well as the perpetrators of attacks. The Palestinian casualties were mostly killed by Israeli security forces in stepped-up army operations in the occupied West Bank. The recent escalation has raised fears of another armed conflict similar to the 11-day war a year ago between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, which was in part triggered by unrest at al-Aqsa, a site holy to both Jews and Muslims. Informally, Jews are allowed to visit but not pray at the site. In recent years, however, growing numbers of Jewish visitors, sometimes praying with police escorts, have inflamed longstanding Palestinian fears that Israel plans to annex the area. The Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, told his cabinet on Sunday that the country was entering a 'new stage in the war on terror' and said Israel was establishing a civilian national guard that would be deployed in emergency situations like the kinds of attacks the country has witnessed in recent weeks. 'The Israeli government's main goal is to restore personal security to Israeli citizens,' he said. Bennett will also convene his security cabinet this week to discuss Israel's options in responding to the latest incident and incitement from Hamas. All of the recent attacks on Israeli soil appear to have been committed by individuals or small groups acting without coordination from larger organisations. Hamas leaders praised Thursday's events in Elad, but did not claim responsibility. The Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth reported on Sunday that officials were considering restricting the entry of Gazan workers into Israel and mending the hundreds of holes in the West Bank separation barrier that thousands of Palestinians use to access illegal work in Israel. Aware of the economic pressures facing Palestinian society, and benefiting from the cheap labour, Israel had until recently been turning a blind eye to the illegal crossings from the West Bank.", "d1d862b4e9c80300f624bbff1008c7fc420870bb326453f2cb59f387": "Senator Kirsten Gillibrand on Sunday called the battle over abortion rights in the US the 'biggest fight of a generation'. The New York Democrat urged her party to stand up to Republicans seeking to abolish the constitutional right, and called the draft US supreme court opinion leaked last week, revealing a conservative-leaning super-majority supports overturning the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade decision, 'bone-chilling'. She told CNN's State of the Union Sunday politics talkshow: 'This is the biggest fight of a generation ... and if America's women and the men who love them do not fight right now, we will lose the basic right to make decisions, to have bodily autonomy and to decide what our futures look like.' Mississippi's Republican governor, Tate Reeves, praised the draft ruling, which emerged last Monday evening and immediately sparked protests outside the supreme court in Washington DC, with more the next day and huge demonstrations planned across the US. His state has the pivotal case currently before the court that includes the option not just to severely restrict the procedure further but specifically to overturn the Roe v Wade opinion that made abortion a federal right, which was reaffirmed by the supreme court in 1992. 'While this is a great victory for the pro-life movement, it is not the end. In fact, it's just the beginning,' Reeves said of the draft opinion. Mississippi hopes to ban almost all abortion in a state that normally carries out around 3,500 such procedures a year. He talked of providing more education for women, to help them get better jobs to support children. Gillibrand called Reeves 'paternalistic' and his and the court's stance outrageous. 'It's taking away women's right for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, our right to be a full citizen,' she said, adding that women are 'half-citizens under this ruling and if this is put into law, it changes the foundation of America'. Reeves said Mississippi plans to improve adoption processes and foster care systems and provide more resources for those expecting. However the state has a poor record on healthcare for low-income women, particularly women of color, in a nation frequently called out for high infant mortality rates and poor antenatal health. CNN host Jake Tapper noted that Mississippi has the highest rate of child mortality in the US, the highest rate of child poverty, no guaranteed paid maternity leave and that the legislature in Mississippi 'just rejected extending postpartum Medicaid coverage', referring to government health insurance for low-income populations. Tapper also pointed out that Mississippi's foster care system is the subject of a long-running federal lawsuit over its failure to protect children from abuse. Reeves said: 'I was elected not to try to hide our problems but to try to fix our problems.' Gillibrand said she was offended by Reeves's remarks, adding: 'I thought he was quite paternalistic towards women. He doesn't look at women as full citizens.' The Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, a fellow New York Democrat, said on Sunday that a piece of legislation that has been stalled in Congress would be put to the vote by the Senate again, on Wednesday. The Women's Health Protection Act, which enshrines the rights afforded by Roe into federal legislation, rather than relying on court decisions, has passed the House of Representatives but was struck down in the Senate in March, with one Democrat joining Republicans in opposing it. The final supreme court decision on Roe is due in June.  Overturning Roe and instead letting each state set its own law on abortion would leave entire regions of the country without an abortion clinic within a day's drive, reshaping the geography of abortion access in America in a single seismic shift. Minnesota Democratic senator Amy Klobuchar told ABC's This Week host Martha Raddatz that there were Democrats in Congress and Democratic candidates who do not support abortion rights. But she said: 'You have people who are personally pro-life but believe that that decision should be a woman's personal choice, even if they might not agree with them. We have people in our party who vote to uphold Roe v Wade who might have different personal opinions, that's a really important distinction.' She accused the supreme court, which achieved a right-leaning controlling majority after Donald Trump nominated three justices - now having six conservatives and only three liberal-leaning judges on the nine-member bench, of wanting to take America back into ancient history. The draft opinion was written by conservative justice Samuel Alito. 'The court is looking at reversing 50 years of women's rights, and the fall will be swift. Over 20 states have laws [to ban] in place already. Who should make this decision, should it be a woman and her doctor, or a politician? Should it be [conservative Republican Senator] Ted Cruz ... or a woman and her family? Justice Alito is literally not just taking us back to the 1950s, he's taking us back to the 1850s,' Klobuchar said. Pro-abortion rights groups Naral Pro-Choice America, Planned Parenthood and Emily's List plan between the three of them to put more than $150m into campaigns to support abortion rights advocates as political candidates in elections this year. Mini Timmaraju, president of NARAL, told ABC: 'As a movement, this has been probably the most devastating year since pre-1973.'", "12fb3ba5346ce251be2ba02739ed89f6a81cf2f71cdde767114674c3": "Picnics have been banned and bins fenced off in a large swathe of northern Rome as health authorities move to contain the wild boar population after African swine fever was detected in a deceased animal. Feeding or approaching the animals has also been forbidden, while people who have walked through farmland or nature reserves in the affected areas have been told to disinfect their shoes. African swine fever, which is fatal to pigs and wild boar but harmless to humans, was detected in the body of a dead boar in the Insugherata nature reserve on Thursday. It was the first time a case had been reported in the centre of Italy after the disease was found in wild boar in the northern Piedmont region in January, prompting the government to appoint a special commissioner to impose measures to eradicate the illness. The affected anti-boar 'red zones' in Rome are located in the north and north-west of the Italian capital, including an area close to Vatican City. About 23,000 wild boar live in and around Rome, according to estimates from Coldiretti, the farmers' association. The animals are often seen in parks, walking down the road or searching for food in overflowing rubbish bins, mostly in districts in the north of the city. Residents in several neighbourhoods last week imposed a nightly 'curfew' after a spate of attacks by wild boar. One woman suffered minor injuries after being pushed to the ground by animal she encountered as she put out the rubbish. The Italian health minister, Roberto Speranza, said the situation would receive 'maximum attention'. Andrea Costa, a health ministry undersecretary, said the government was also discussing a 'slaughtering plan' to reduce the wild boar population.

Kami Rita Sherpa, 52, scaled the 8,849-metre mountain on Saturday along the traditional south-east ridge route leading 10 other Sherpa climbers.'Kami Rita has broken his own record and established a new world record in climbing,' Taranath Adhikari, director general of the Department of Tourism in the capital of Kathmandu, said on Sunday.Kami Rita's wife, who gave her name as Jangmu, said she was happy at her husband's achievement. The climbing route used by Kami Rita was pioneered by New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary and Nepali sherpa Tenzing Norgay in 1953 and remains the most popular.This year Nepal has issued 316 permits to climb Everest in the peak season, which runs through May, compared with 408 last year, the highest ever. On Sunday Nepali officials said Russian climber Pavel Kostrikin died at Camp I of Mount Everest, the first reported death of a foreigner this climbing season. 'The Russian climber fell sick at Camp II and died after being brought to the Camp I,' Bhishma Kumar Bhattarai, an official of Nepal's Department of Tourism, said. Camp II on the normal southeast ridge route on Everest is located at a height of around 6,400 metres (20,997 feet). Hiking officials said the body of Kostrikin would be brought to Kathmandu when the current cloudy weather conditions improve.The Himalayan nation, which is heavily reliant on climbers for foreign exchange, faced criticism for allowing overcrowding and several climber deaths on the mountains in 2019.Everest has been climbed 10,657 times since it was first scaled in 1953 from Nepali and Tibetan sides. Many have climbed multiple times, and 311 people have died so far, according to the Himalayan database.", "722193f9350a32ad5330718f59b5e154706f3e3bf2d7a4b43ba146fe": "The torsos of two statues of boxers, dating back to the iron age, have been discovered at the Mont'e Prama necropolis in Sardinia. The latest finds, sculpted in limestone by the Nuragic civilisation, add to several other statues of boxers, wrestlers and archers dug up at the site since the 1970s and which have become known as 'the giants of Mont'e Prama'. The bare torsos, along with their fragments, have been identified as depicting Cavalupo boxers, due to the shield wrapped around their bodies. They are similar to two other statues found a few metres away at the site in Cabras, on the Italian island's west coast, in 2014. The discovery comes after fresh excavations in the southern area of the huge necropolis began in early April. 'It's an exceptional discovery,' said the Italian culture minister, Dario Franceschini, adding that it would shed further light on ancient Mediterranean culture. 'Two new jewels add to the mysterious charm of this group of statues,' he said. Archaeologists have also unearthed a major burial road, along which tombs dating between 950BC to 730BC have been found. The Mont'e Prama site was first discovered by local farmers in 1974. It is believed that the warrior statues, ranging in height between 2 and 2.5 metres, guarded tombs at the necropolis. Studies done so far of 170 tombs found that the cemetery was reserved almost exclusively for young men. The Nuragic civilisation flourished in Sardinia until the second century AD. Thousands of large tower-shaped stone structures, known as nuraghi, have been found across the island, although their original purpose is unknown. Some of the statues found at Mont'e Parma have been on display at Cabras museum since 2014. The new statues will also eventually be exhibited. Monica Stochino, the culture ministry's superintendent for southern Sardinia, said: 'The two large and heavy blocks of torsos will need time to be freed from the sediment surrounding them and to be prepared for safe recovery.'", "7ac1478e927a9df9aab1b581aace72a2ad12cd3a52eb54179eb01783": "About 20m acres of cropland in the United States may be contaminated from PFAS-tainted sewage sludge that has been used as fertilizer, a new report estimates. PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a class of about 9,000 compounds used to make products heat-, water- or stain-resistant. Known as 'forever chemicals' because they don't naturally break down, they have been linked to cancer, thyroid disruption, liver problems, birth defects, immunosuppression and more. Dozens of industries use PFAS in thousands of consumer products, and often discharge the chemicals into the nation's sewer system. The analysis, conducted by the Environmental Working Group (EWG), is an attempt to understand the scope of cropland contamination stemming from sewage sludge, or biosolids. Regulators don't require sludge to be tested for PFAS or closely track where its spread, and public health advocates warn the practice is poisoning the nation's food supply. 'We don't know the full scope of the contamination problem created by PFAS in sludge, and we may never know, because EPA has not made it a priority for states and local governments to track, test and report on,' said Scott Faber, EWG's legislative policy director. All sewage sludge is thought to contain the dangerous chemicals, and the compounds have recently been found to be contaminating crops, cattle, water and humans on farms where biosolids were spread. Sludge is a byproduct of the wastewater treatment process that's a mix of human excrement and industrial waste, like PFAS, that's discharged from industry's pipes. Sludge disposal can be expensive so the waste management industry is increasingly repackaging it as fertilizer because excrement is rich in plant nutrients. EWG found Ohio keeps the most precise records of any state, and sludge has been applied to 5% of its farmland since 2011. Extrapolating that across the rest of the country would mean about 20m acres are contaminated with at least some level of PFAS. Faber called the estimate 'conservative'. EPA records show over 19bn pounds of sludge has been used as fertilizer since 2016 in the 41 states where the agency tracks the amount of sludge that's spread, but not the location. It's estimated that 60% of the nation's sludge is spread on cropland or other fields annually. The consequences are evident in the only two states to consistently check sludge and farms for PFAS contamination. In Maine, PFAS-tainted fields have already forced several farms to shut down. The chemicals end up in crops and cattle, and the public health toll exacted by contaminated food in Maine is unknown. Meanwhile, the state is investigating about 700 more fields for PFAS pollution. 'There's no easy way to shop around this problem,' Faber said. 'We shouldn't be using PFAS-contaminated sludge to grow food and feed for animals.' Michigan faces a similar situation as it uncovers contaminated beef and farms, and growing evidence links sludge to public health problems and contaminated drinking water. The health cost of using sludge outweighs the benefits, advocates say. Many have questioned the sense in spending billions of dollars to pull sludge out of water only to inject the substance into the nation's food supply, and calls for a ban on the practice are growing louder. 'The EPA could today require treatment plants to test sludge for PFAS and warn farmers that they may be contaminating fields, but it has refused to do so,' Faber said.", "aefde38fa7c351399e7d42e94edf7801f0dc4e026de7001df49cd544": "Scientists are developing magnetically guided microscopic projectiles that can be injected into patients' blood to attack breast, prostate and other tumours.  The project - led by researchers at Sheffield University - builds on progress in two key medical fields. The first involves viruses that specifically attack tumours. The second focuses on soil bacteria that manufacture magnets which they use to align themselves in the Earth's magnetic field. 'The essence of this approach is straightforward: we are using bugs as drugs,' said Dr Munitta Muthana, one of the project's leaders. 'We are taking a class of viruses that naturally target tumours and are developing ways to help them reach internal tumours by exploiting bacteria that make magnets. It's a twin approach and it has a lot of promise, we believe.' The anti-cancer viruses that are being exploited by the Sheffield group - who have been funded by Cancer Research UK - are known as oncolytic viruses. They occur naturally but can also be modified to improve their efficacy and to limit the chances of them infecting healthy cells. After infection with an oncolytic virus, a cancer cell will burst open and die. The US Food and Drug Administration has already approved the use of T-Vec, a modified herpes simplex virus that infects and kills tumour cells and is now being used to treat people with certain types of melanoma, a skin cancer. However, the Sheffield team - whose work has just been awarded the Roger Griffin prize for cancer drug discovery - want to expand the range of tumours that can be tackled this way. In particular, they want to target breast and prostate cancers as priorities. 'The problem is that oncolytic viruses attract the attention of the body's immune defences and only skin-deep tumours can be tackled this way before the viruses are blocked fairly quickly by our cell defences,' said Dr Faith Howard, another project leader. A solution, the scientists say, is to coat the viruses in magnetic particles. Injected into the blood, these microscopic projectiles could then be directed quickly to a tumour - by using magnets placed over a patient's body - before their progress can be blocked by immune defences. 'It's like having a coat of armour or a shield,' added Muthana. 'The magnets help protect the virus but crucially they also help them to target a tumour. We place a magnet over a tumour and it will draw the virus speedily and directly to it.' An oncolytic virus had a diameter of about 180 nanometres while the magnets needed to be about 50 nanometres in size, added Howard. (A nanometre is a billionth of a metre.) 'These tiny magnets could be made in the laboratory but we have found bacteria do a better job of manufacturing them than we could,' she added. Some species of soil bacteria synthesise iron oxide nanoparticles that are called magnetosomes. These are used as compasses that allow the microbes to navigate in Earth's magnetic field and help them find optimum conditions for their growth and survival. 'These microscopic magnets they make are perfectly shaped and ideally suited to the microscopic packages we need to target deep cancers,' Howard said. Having developed the technology, the Sheffield team is now working to ensure they can manufacture sufficient supplies so that clinical trials on humans can begin soon. To date, trials have focused on animal models. 'These early tests have been very encouraging and we now need to take the next steps to bring this technique to a state where it can be administered to humans - hopefully in a few years' time,' she said.", "935ad3bfbff62e0419c222335be9f8927bf2f53091c3e40917495749": "The UN is to stage a rare donor conference on Wednesday in a bid to raise the $80m (PS65m) necessary to prevent an ageing oil tanker off the west coast of Yemen exploding and causing an environmental disaster potentially four times worse than the Exxon Valdez spill near Alaska in 1989. The money is needed to offload more than 1.14m barrels of oil that have been sitting in the decrepit cargo ship, Safer, for more than six years because of an impasse between Houthi groups and the Saudi-backed government over ownership and responsibility. Previous UN mediation efforts over the potentially lethal byproduct of Yemen's civil war have failed, partly because the Houthi rebels that now control the capital, Sana'a, have not been able to agree terms for UN-commissioned engineers to board the ship. The Houthis have regarded the ship and its lucrative cargo as their possession and a bargaining chip in the negotiations with the Saudi- and Emirati-backed forces.  Expert engineers and environmentalists have warned the ship is an unexploded timebomb capable of causing an ecological disaster. UN estimates suggest that if the ship's cargo is unleashed into the Red Sea, more than 200,000 fishermen would lose their jobs and $20bn would be required for a clean-up operation. But under a new agreement, laboriously negotiated over six months by the UN and Dutch diplomats, an international donor conference will aim to raise the required $80m to offload the light crude oil. The plan is the brainchild of the UN resident coordinator and humanitarian coordinator for Yemen, David Gressly, who claims it has the support of the Saudi-backed and Houthi-backed governments. A memorandum of understanding was signed by the Houthis on 5 March that allows the UN to transfer about 1.1m barrels of oil from the vessel, which is stranded 8km off Ras Isa port on Yemen's Houthi-held west coast. The oil would be transferred to a secure vessel which would remain in place. A new tanker would be purchased for the Houthis within 18 months to replace Safer, thus providing them with the insurance that they would be able to operate a profitable oil export industry when the civil war ends. The Safer vessel would be towed and sold for scrap. The Houthis would have no legal or commercial liability. Gressly said the crisis was urgent since 'in March, a UN-led mission to the Ras Isa peninsula confirmed that the 45-year-old supertanker is rapidly decaying. It is at imminent risk of spilling a massive amount of oil due to leakages or an explosion'. Inert air on the ship that normally inhibits an explosion has dissipated, the UN said. Doug Weir at the Conflict and Environment Observatory said: 'While some may question the $80m price tag of the UN-mediated plan to address the threat posed by the FSO Safer, the costs of inaction - which start at $20bn for managing the consequences of a catastrophic spill - are far, far greater. The world has watched this situation grow more dangerous with every passing month, and it's vital that donors provide the money that is needed to allow this urgent plan to proceed this summer.' Greenpeace said the UN plan must be implemented before October, 'when the wind and the currents will be too dangerous and hinder any rescue operation. Lack of funding cannot be an excuse to fail.' Constructed in 1976 as an oil tanker and converted a decade later to be a floating storage facility for oil, no structural repairs have been made to the 376-metre-long vessel since Yemen's civil war started in 2015. It contains 36 different oil storage facilities amounting to a capacity of more than 3m barrels. The unavailability of diesel fuel has meant that Safer's engines have not been started for several years, and the structure has been exposed to humidity and corrosion with little or no maintenance. A major spillage would force the closure of the ports of Hodeidah and As Salif - which are essential for commercial imports and the provision of life-saving humanitarian assistance. Depending on the season and prevailing wind and currents, the environmental impact could hit Saudi Arabia, Eritrea, Djibouti and Somalia, as well as disrupt shipping through the Bab al-Mandab Strait and the Red Sea. The Red Sea remains highly biodiverse, with coral reefs, coastal mangroves and many endemic species. The donor conference comes at a time of the first nationwide ceasefire in Yemen in six years and a Saudi-overseen change in the leadership of the Aden government. A new seven-strong anti-Houthi Presidential Leadership Council has been formed, a move that involves the long-serving and ailing President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi relinquishing his executive powers.", "45720c91c423fb39212c11bef069cb5bbc6118638bff881b35995c2e": "The Conservative party donor at the centre of a bribery scandal that drew in two former prime ministers is to leave the oil group he ran for 20 years. Ayman Asfari, the Syrian-born executive who built London-listed Petrofac into a global oil engineering company, will leave the company next year. It will mark an end to a colourful career at the firm, during which Asfari was arrested and interviewed in 2017 when the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) began its investigation. Petrofac agreed to pay PS77m last October after failing to prevent former senior employees from offering or paying bribes to secure contracts in the Middle East between 2012 and 2015. The SFO last month formally confirmed Asfari was no longer a suspect. Asfari spent more than three decades building his empire, amassing the trappings of a billionaire lifestyle with a private jet and a superyacht to cruise on the French riviera. The success of his early career, carved out in the 1980s oil boom, has been overshadowed by the long-running fraud office investigation. He stepped down as chief executive of the oil services company in late 2020 but has remained on the board since. The company has now disclosed in its annual report that he will depart at next summer's annual shareholder meeting. Petrofac was founded in Texas in 1981, before expanding internationally, and Asfari led a management buyout and a float on the London stock market in 2005. The listing netted him PS55m but he has lamented that selling his 10% stake was a mistake, as the value of the company subsequently ballooned. Asfari, 63, was born in Syria but spent his childhood on the move. His father's diplomatic postings took him to Turkey, the US and the former Czechoslovakia. He studied at Wharton business school, whose alumni include Donald Trump and Sundar Pinchai, chief executive of Google's owner, Alphabet. He began his career as a consulting engineer testing soil in Dubai. In the early 1980s, he moved to Muscat in Oman, starting a construction business building roads to drilling locations and camps amid the oil boom. His business entered into a joint-venture with America's Petrofac and Asfari eventually rebooted the business, pursuing growth outside the US from a London office. Asfari has said his upbringing gave him a western view of the world, but he can 'understand the emotions and the romantic approach of the east'. He went on to build a firm with 8,500 employees and more than 30 offices worldwide, designing and maintaining rigs and pipelines for the world's biggest oil and gas companies. Petrofac and its peers were briefly stock market darlings a decade ago before a declining oil price hit shares. The stock has fallen 80% since the SFO opened its investigation. The affair threw a spotlight on two former prime ministers' links to the company. In 2017, David Cameron promoted the company during a two-day stay in Bahrain, flying back from the country on a plane owned by Asfari. Theresa May wrote to her Bahraini counterpart to support Petrofac's bid for a contract in the country during her tenure in Downing Street. Petrofac did not ultimately land the contract. Asfari has, with his wife, given about PS800,000 to the Conservative party. He remains a 17% shareholder and an influential figure at Petrofac. Last year, investors gave the company a bloody nose over his continued involvement - more than 30% of shareholders voted against his re-appointment. The company responded, saying he had provided 'additional support and stability in a year of significant challenge'. Shareholder adviser Glass Lewis says, given his impending retirement, it is happy to recommend investors approve his re-election to the board this month. Petrofac said in the annual report that the SFO investigation had 'cast a shadow' and been a 'painful learning experience', and that former employees had left its teams feeling 'let down'. Four former employees have had their outstanding share awards cancelled. The company's chairman, Rene Medori, was due to step down this month but will now stay on for an extra year. Under the new chief executive, Sami Iskander, it hopes to make a break from the past. For Asfari, a new chapter beckons. Last year, he formed Venterra, a venture aimed at creating a services business for the offshore wind industry. He's also switching sea lanes: Asfari has reportedly put his almost-new 61-metre (201-ft) superyacht up for sale. The Cloud 9, built as an opulent pleasure boat with its own swimming pool and private terrace, is up for sale for a rumoured EUR59m (PS51m).", "895cf29db39ef91c5660dbafa08c24c451e4247bb5eb47b1ab07dd08": "Emmanuel Macron said that his reelection marked a 'fundamental democratic renaissance' as he was sworn in for a second term of office as president of France at a ceremony at the Elysee Palace. Macron, who defeated his far right rival, Marine Le Pen, in the second round vote two weeks ago, entered on Saturday to the strains of Handel played by the Garde Republicaine's string quartet and listened as the official results were read. 'From the return of war to Europe to the pandemic and the ecological emergency, rarely has our country been faced with such a combination of challenges. The French people have chosen a clear and explicit project for the future, a European project of independence, scientific, social and ecological progress,' he told the 500 guests in a relatively brief acceptance speech, 'It's at the most difficult times that France shows the best of itself. At this moment when the century is changing, we have to map out a path and show a way forward together,' he said. 'Let us have the courage to look reality in the face. Let us be faithful to the values of freedom, equality, fraternity and secularism. Let us continue to love the Republic and all that it entails. Let us love our homeland.' He insisted his second five-year term would not be a simple continuation of the first mandate but would be a 'new method'. He pledged 'to act' to create a 'more inclusive' education system, and 'a health service accessible everywhere' as well as greater sexual equality and a stronger military. 'I have one aim and that is to serve, to serve our country ... to serve my compatriots with a sense of duty ... to serve our children and youngsters,' he said. Afterwards he shook hands with many of the guests who included former presidents Nicolas Sarkozy and Francois Hollande as well as current members of his cabinet all facing a reshuffle in the coming days. He then walked to the Elysee gardens to honour the Tricolor while the Marseillaise was played followed by a 21-gun salute fired from Les Invalides military complex. Macron, 44, who won the election on 24 April with a score of 58.55% against Le Pen, is now expected to name a new prime minister to replace Jean Castex as well as other ministers. Gabriel Attal, the government spokesperson, told France 2 the government would not change before Macron's second mandate officially begins on 13 May. Saturday's ceremony came after the Parti Socialiste along with the Greens/Ecologists and Communists formed a historic alliance for next month's two-round parliamentary elections under the leadership of the radical left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, of La France Insoumise (France Unbowed), who came a close third in the presidential election. Various centrist and centre-right factions have rallied to Macron under the slogan Ensemble (Together); the president has changed the name of his La Republique en Marche (Republic on the Move) party - formed to sweep him to power five years ago - to Renaissance. Macron now faces a battle to retain control of the French parliament in what will be his final five years in power.", "a067d6b559d782af139c63e6e2dedd7141d19ef1c877964fa6112660": "", "f31db6036b453218a9abd855ae38de5e96af6c6429a89417a4119822": "", "5c77cfae98e0a8f0cd9cba3c1adce7e9f722c5c49fecd5fd9ae24337": "", "07bacfb3793dd4fc22c08593dbd1268187f59d773e8a49d3185b789a": "", "239b2179dc30dbfd323e62327c5bc9c770a9aff70aebb806c0b32514": "In 1950s Paris, Regine Zylberberg, a barmaid, cloakroom assistant and occasional seller of bras in the local market, had an idea that would transform the city's nightlife and make her the darling of the international jet set. Fed up with customers at the famous Whisky-a-Go-Go club repeatedly playing the same songs on the jukebox, and remarking that the sound of 'couples snogging in the corners' between records killed the atmosphere, she installed two turntables for continuous music. It was the start of a career as a nightclub owner for the woman who would become known simply as Regine and that would see her credited as creating la discotheque. Regine, nicknamed Queen of the Night, has died aged 92. From her first club in Paris's Latin Quarter, Chez Regine, established in 1956, her empire would eventually stretch to more than 20 establishments entertaining the world's beau monde: the rich; the famous; the aristocratic, including royals, from Buenos Aires to Monte Carlo via Kuala Lumpur, Cairo and Los Angeles. Her clientele was eclectic but almost exclusively wealthy, powerful and well connected, among them Andy Warhol, Brigitte Bardot, the Rothschilds, the Kennedys, Liza Minnelli, Truman Capote, Marlene Dietrich, Henry Miller, Richard Nixon, the future president Georges Pompidou, the mobster John Gotti and Salvador Dali. She dyed her hair flame red and attracted diverse lovers: the actors Robert Mitchum, Warren Beatty, Gene Kelly, Steve McQueen and Omar Sharif, and singer Jacques Brel, as well as sporting stars and alpinists Jean-Claude Killy and Maurice Herzog, the Spanish matador El Cordobes and the Swedish tennis champion Bjorn Borg. 'I do love champions,' she told French television. Dancing was her passion: 'If you can't dance, you can't make love,' she would say, and she famously taught the Duke of Windsor to do the twist. The rich and famous went to Regine's, where drinks were sold by the bottle, to see and be seen, but their exclusivity was founded on illusion; a 'Full' sign would be put outside each of her clubs even as they opened, a hype that created the demand that saw everyone, however privileged, queue to enter. 'After a certain hour [of the night], it's sometimes difficult to distinguish a princess from a prostitute. And one doesn't exclude the other,' she wrote in her memoirs. Only London failed to fall for Regine's charms. Her two attempts to open clubs in the city crashed. 'The English have no style,' she claimed afterwards. By the early 80s, Regine also had her own line of perfume, but as times and tastes changed, the clubs closed, and bad investments diminished her fortune. For those who knew her traumatic history, and she made no secret of it, Regine's self-professed workaholism and search for recognition and respect were rooted in trying to compensate for a childhood blighted by an alcoholic father, an absent mother and the Nazis. Regina (she became Regine later) was born in Anderlecht, Belgium, to Tauba Rodstein and Joseph Zylberberg, both Polish Ashkenazi Jews. Her parents had lived for eight years in Argentina and moved to Paris when Joseph, a drinker and gambler, lost the family boulangerie in a poker game. Rodstein soon gave up and returned to Argentina, leaving Regina and her brother, Maurice, in their largely absent father's care. During the Nazi occupation of France, the children went into hiding in a series of foster homes, including a convent in Aix-en-Provence where Regina was beaten by other girls for being Jewish. At the age of 14, she was working at a refuge for the elderly in Lyon where she fell in love with the owners' son, Claude, nephew of Bernard Schonberg, the chief rabbi in the city. In 1944 he was on his way to the synagogue to discuss marrying her when he was arrested by the Nazis and dispatched to the concentration camps, where he died. Shortly afterwards, aged 16, Regina married Leon Rotcajg, with whom she had a son, Lionel, but they divorced four years later. In postwar Paris, Regine worked in the cafe-bar-brasserie in the 20th arrondissement established by her father, where she also learned to cook. After opening Chez Regine, in France she also became well known as a singer and occasional actor, starring in films by the directors Claude Lelouch and Claude Zidi and recording a number of albums. Having sold all her nightclubs by the late 2000s, Regine declared herself 'ruined'. However, she went on to harness her connections for charitable causes, including the fight against drug abuse, wrote three volumes of a memoir and returned to singing. In 2015, she set off for her first concert tour, performing just some of the 300 songs she claimed had been written for her during her lifetime. 'For a long time, songs were just a hobby. But now I realise that the stage has been the most important part of my life,' she said. Asked by a French journalist why she had not retained her family name, and went by Regine, she responded: 'Can you imagine someone saying 'tonight, we'll meet at the Regina Zylberberg...'? By the time you say it, the night is already over.' In a profile published in New York magazine in 1977, Regine said her penchant for throwing spectacular events was to make up for all the birthday parties she never had. 'One by one, I have filled the dreams of my childhood,' she told the magazine. She married Roger Choukroun, a computer engineer, in 1969 and divorced him in 2004, but despite her marriages and many lovers, Regine would always describe Claude Schonberg as her 'first and only true love'. Her son, Lionel, died in 2006. She is survived by a granddaughter, Daphne.", "47fe6f624f71705e58c0b59734ca714c35321c2f2f226c05bfffd528": "", "134cb3f6f6c1e132b3a3b0ca53c7e941bb25b1378025f579eb67324b": "", "c07136d7b03acf854f6ed9ce954630be8de7823a99968d2375dc054f": "", "dfcaced8958ff0442fc0f61fff1b47c8c22486aebb405ba15de8da6f": "", "b61bcb40292c0a068b827747194f92a500cfbd52ec82417ed93f80ee": "", "3714e8b8822d826d52907b330049d76531087f14496d1f8f966b7fc3": "In a slightly creaky, book-filled office at Cardiff University, Matthew Williams pulls up a blood-red graph on his computer. At first glance you might think it referred to stock market fortunes, but when I peer closely, the sad truth behind its jagged peaks becomes clear: it traces the amount of anti-Black hate speech recorded on Twitter in the aftermath of last July's Euro 2020 final, when England lost to Italy in a nail-biting penalty shootout. After missed penalties from three Black England players, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka, racist abuse 'went through the roof', says Williams. Within the hour there was an almost 700% increase in hate directed against those players. Half of the 20,000 toxic tweets came from within the UK; the police made 11 arrests for hate crimes, four of which have resulted in prosecutions. In some ways this is a textbook example of a hate-filled outburst. There was a trigger event and, for many offenders, lots of alcohol and drugs involved. That the abuse trickled off over the following two days is also typical. But the content of the hate directed against the players was new. Alongside familiar racists slurs there was a deluge of primate emojis. Williams calls this a key shift. 'We've never seen emojis used as features of hate speech in that way - and volume - before.' Williams would know: he is a professor of criminology specialising in hate crimes and, along with computer scientist Pete Burnap, is the co-founder of the HateLab, a platform that monitors hate across social media in real time. They are on the frontline of internet hate, observing shifts in behaviour and figuring out who is stirring the fury. They pass their insights on to civil rights organisations, governments and big tech firms who use it to inform counter-hate-speech campaigns, ban users and pursue prosecutions. An all-seeing eye for the racist, misogynistic, homophobic, transphobic venom that humans spit at one another from behind keyboards, Williams has advised everyone from Twitter, Meta (formerly Facebook), Google and TikTok to the Professional Footballers Association, the UK Home Office and the US Department of Justice. The 45-year-old has also just published a book that investigates the biological and sociological reasons why people commit hate crimes. The Science of Hate asks big, urgent questions: is everyone capable of hate? Is this the most hateful the world has ever been? And, perhaps most importantly, how can we combat it? In recent years, hate has felt omnipresent. 'It is no coincidence that soaring hate-crime figures are found in countries where the extreme right is rising,' writes Williams, adding that 'divisive messages from public figures are directly linked to tipping some people into violence on the streets.' The 2016 election of Donald Trump coincided with the biggest rise in hate crimes in the US since 9/11. And the HateLab found there were 1,100 racist attacks committed in the UK as a direct result of the 2016 Brexit referendum result. In nations with reasonable hate-crime recording standards, such as the UK, US and much of Europe, the data points to an 'upward trend,' says Williams. The internet has amplified the rage by giving people a 24/7 hotline to spurt poisonous views and egg one another on. A 2021 survey found that half of all 12- to 15-year-olds in the UK had encountered hateful content online. 'Left unchallenged,' he writes, 'the expression of hate... has the potential to become more widespread than at any other point in history.' Yet Williams is no doomster. With neatly combed hair, a gently lilting Welsh accent and an easy laugh, he is a surprisingly cheery character given his line of work. He does, however, want to awaken us to the fact that 'everyone' has prejudices - 'You can say you don't but you're lying' - and, under the right mix of circumstances, has the potential to slide towards hateful behaviour. It's a sobering thought in a woke era in which we're loath to admit any prejudices. But it's intended as a rallying cry. Being mindful of our own prejudices helps us keep them in check - and understanding how biases work better equips us to de-fang those who peddle hate, especially online. 'To keep my faith in humanity I have to constantly remind myself that the majority are not hateful,' says Williams. 'What I hope for is for more of these good citizens to stand up to hatred when they see it, instead of scrolling or walking on.' Williams, who is gay, knows full well how damaging a hate crime can be. In 1998, when he was 20, he was beaten up by three men after leaving a gay bar in London. Their punches were punctuated by snickering and homophobic slurs. The attack shook him. 'I couldn't get it out of my head: it filled my thoughts until there was no room for anything else,' he says. Even today, he won't hold his husband's hand in public for fear of being targeted. 'It's stayed with me for a long, long time.' It also shaped his career, prompting the then-aspiring journalist to switch to criminology. A key thrust behind the book was to find out what made his attackers do what they did that day. 'There's this notion that all hate crime offenders are monsters beyond understanding and that if you dare to try to understand them, you humanise them or in some way provide an excuse for their behaviour,' he says. 'I wanted to find something that really separated me from my attackers, something that was unique about them - and different from me.' Instead, his findings showed that he and his attackers were, in all likelihood, 'remarkably similar in our biology and psychology'. The common core? An innate human desire to be part of a group and to favour people we perceive to be like us. Such 'groupishness' is an evolutionary trait: huddling with others increases our chance of survival. And it means that, from a young age, we instinctively view the world through the lens of our group and other folks: 'us' and 'them'. Our behaviour towards 'others' occupies a spectrum, with unconscious bias at one end, prejudice in the middle and hate at the other extreme. Whereas prejudiced behaviour means avoiding others, hateful acts seek them out in order to hurt them. There's often a twisted moral element to hate, too, with offenders claiming that the victim's group are an affront to their way of life. Neuroscientific studies suggest bias is mapped on to our brains: the amygdala, a 'fast but dumb' threat detector in our temporal lobe, as Williams puts it, often sounds an alarm when it registers someone who is not like us. The smarter prefrontal cortex then overrules it when it realises there is nothing to worry about (most studies on this relate to race). But research suggests certain individuals can develop an oversized amygdala and a weak executive control centre, meaning they instinctively overreact to threats and then have no reasoning function to calm things down. Statistically, hate offenders are most likely to be young men (and in western countries, white). Williams imagines them to be 'fearful, angry and powerless'. Traumatic childhoods often set them apart. Many grew up with abusive or absent parents and experienced personal losses, homelessness, drug addictions or other traumas that left them emotionally unstable. 'Childhood scars can thwart psychological development to a point where normal coping mechanisms are either malfunctioning or absent,' he writes. Williams cites a study from the University of Manchester involving in-depth interviews with 15 young white British men convicted of racial violence. When stressed or triggered, they took out their frustrations on ethnic minorities who they 'saw as having less power than them', he writes. 'Race hate provided a convenient home... for their unresolved frustrations from past trauma.' The racial 'other' was an easy target: hate almost always involves punching down. (For the most extreme type of hate criminal, a 'mission offender', eliminating other groups is seen as serving a higher purpose. Examples include suicide bombers; the 1999 London nailbomber who targeted gay, black and Bengali communities; and Joseph Paul Franklin, a KKK member who, during the 1970s and 80s, killed more than 20 black people.) While it's human nature to classify 'us' and 'them', how those lines are drawn is - at least theoretically - not fixed. 'Evolution tells us that we're not inherently racist or biased against a religion or a sexual orientation,' says Williams. That certain groups are consistently targeted for hate is a product of social forces: it is shaped by what we see in the media, what our parents tell us and who we interact with growing up (children who attend mixed-race schools before the age of 12 are less likely to possess race-related bias). And new battle lines are constantly being drawn. Covid has pitted vaxxers and anti-vaxxers against one another, seen a spike in anti-Asian hate crimes and resulted in experts and even the NHS becoming targets of derision. The unique dynamics of social media can spur people into hateful outbursts. Filter bubbles and algorithms reinforce and deepen prejudices, while anonymous accounts reduce accountability. When sparked by an event - whether political vote, terror attack or football game - some users temporarily lose their ability to suppress their ingrained biases and take to their keyboards as the mask of civility slips. In what's known as a 'cascade' effect, they're encouraged by the rush of others doing the same, and the perception that 'such actions have little or no consequence', says Williams, who is currently busy monitoring a prolonged wave of hate speech against Russians in the wake of the Ukraine invasion. The most common target for online hate? Women. 'Misogyny is always the most prevalent category on social media: it's a huge problem,' says Williams. Its rifeness is partly attributable to the fact that women account for half the population (most other hate victims are minorities), so there are lots of targets, and to a culture of misogyny that festers among 'incels' and other all-male communities. Misogyny would probably attract the highest number of hate-crime prosecutions - if it were, in fact, a hate crime. In the UK's hate crime legislation, sex and gender are not recognised as protected characteristics, so a judge is not compelled to consider misogyny as an aggravating factor in sentencing and police are not required to record it as a hate statistic. Just this February, MPs rejected a proposal to add it as a category due to concerns it could complicate domestic violence and rape prosecutions. 'Because there's no sort of legal framework there, [anti-women online hate] is probably not policed to any great extent - not in the same way anti-black or anti- Muslim or anti-gay rhetoric would be,' says Williams. Who should be accountable for stamping out hate is a thorny issue. While governments and police should be responsible for dealing with the most serious offences, in many places - including the US but not the UK - hate crimes are woefully under-reported. This is a combination, says Williams, of a lack of police resources (investigating hate crimes requires considerable effort) and lack of trust in police by the most vulnerable members of society. Online, big tech clearly has a role to play in monitoring content on their sites and banning users who go too far. But sifting through the millions of posts requires vast resources and, as Williams puts it, 'There's no money in stopping hate.' There's no thriving marketplace for services that track hate speech and coordinate anti-hate campaigns, meaning organisations doing these things are chronically underfunded and rely on support from government and charities to survive (HateLab is mostly funded by the UK's Economic and Social Research Council and the Alfred Landecker Foundation). By contrast, 'There seems to be more profit in generating hate and keeping people on social media by engaging with it,' says Williams. As is shown by YouTube's famously addictive algorithm, which draws viewers deeper down a rabbit hole by suggesting ever more extreme content, 'hate is sticky'. It's like not being able to avert your eyes from a car crash. Even so, Williams is optimistic that an anti-hate crusade could bear fruit for businesses concerned with bottom lines. 'Can you imagine if you could say your platform was free of hate speech?' he says. 'How great would that be for the company - but also the profits!' Rather than relying on the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, Williams thinks we're best placed to take on the responsibility ourselves. First, we need to learn the art of neutralising hate speech. Our instinct, says Williams, is 'to go in all guns blazing and attack the hate speaker with equally offensive speech sometimes', which - surprise, surprise - escalates the situation. By contrast, calmly challenging the logic of their claims has proven success. 'If they say, 'All Muslims are terrorists,' you say, 'Hang on a second. Don't you think that if every Muslim was a terrorist, we'd have a lot more terror attacks right now? Because there's X many Muslims living in this place.'' The quick-witted among us will be pleased to hear that humour and parody can be handy, too. 'Engaging in a lighthearted way and maybe being a bit sarcastic to highlight the inconsistency of their argument can help - the [hate makers] start to interact a bit more,' he says. And coordinated efforts whereby a group of users are 'singing from the same hymn sheet' are far more effective than solo missions (a catchy hashtag can help engender a sense of solidarity). Such things need to be taught in schools, he says. 'We don't have any solid educational guidance on what the best counter speech is.' Combining this knowledge with an eagle eye, we need to start shutting down bile whenever we see it and taking control of our online spaces. Williams has seen examples of this done with success in the past, such as the 'safety pin' campaign in the aftermath of Brexit, whereby 'every time someone said something racist, a bunch of people would descend on it using the safety-pin hashtag and standing up for migrants.' Williams views Wikipedia as an unlikely North Star. 'It's a self-regulating system: people pull up information if it's false, members of the community flag it and get rid of it. They set their standards of operation.' He's hopeful that we can turn our online spaces into 'more mature' places if counter speakers engage with hate speakers in a sustained, coordinated drive. And en masse. 'That, I think, will change how these platforms look.' It's not rocket science, but it does require a conscious effort. Start by looking at your own prejudices. Then, armed with a calm mind and perhaps a quip or two, pull up your Twitter, Instagram and TikTok feed. And then, you anti-hate hounds, get sniffing.

Every day, hundreds of people arrive at gaps in this stretch of border wall to request political asylum from uniformed federal border agents who stand waiting under a rudimentary metal shade structure in the Sonoran desert heat. Most of those arriving to seek asylum are from Cuba, Venezuela, Colombia, Romania, or other eastern European countries. Official ports of entry dotted along the almost 2,000-mile-long border stretching from the California coast to the Gulf coast of south Texas remain closed to asylum seekers under the government's enduring title 42 public health statute established by Donald Trump's administration at the beginning of thepandemic. So instead migrants arrive at ad-hoc places like these gaps in the wall, alongside the dried-up bed of the Colorado River, to exercise their right to request asylum. In some circumstances, including dangerous conditions in their country of origin, and the distance and difficulty in returning the people there, asylum seekers are exempted from the summary expulsion under title 42 that has upended so many desperate journeys. But to get to the next step in the asylum process, agents in Yuma, according to Customs and Border Protection, require they leave everything behind, except for what they can fit into a small plastic Department of Homeland Security-issued bag. Border residents in Arizona and Texas have observed an increasing number of personal belongings left along the US side of the border wall in the last two years. Usually people leave clothing and sundries, but items such as passports, birth certificates, police reports, and other confidential documents that could be crucial in proving asylum cases have been found abandoned, too. On one trip to the dumpster, Quiroz, director of the AZ-CA Humanitarian Coalition migrant assistance group, came across a navy blue Haitian passport and Cuban passports just lying in the dirt, and he said he can't begin to fathom why. 'Our ports of entries were set up for individuals coming from other countries, and that is where they should be going,' he said, to take part in an orderly and fair legal process. 'But they're not allowed to do that. So, they come here,' he added, indicating the harsh desert and intimidating barrier with its tall metal stakes. He has found rosaries, diaper bags, purses, airline ticket stubs and used face masks. Now the phenomenon is cropping up as a popular backdrop for rightwingers keen on inflammatory immigration talk, and with Texas Republican governor Greg Abbott, under pressure to declare 'an invasion' - especially with the midterm elections looming. Some senior US Border Patrol figures are chiming in. Brandon Judd, union president of the National Border Patrol Council, promoted a white supremacist theory on Fox News last month, claiming that Democrats were going to lift title 42 'to change the demographics of the electorate'. And USBP noted it was Earth Day on 22 April by posting pictures on Instagram of asylum seekers' belongings with the message that it was 'trash and litter left behind by illegal immigration'. In Texas, Brian Hastings, border patrol chief for the Rio Grande Valley sector - another busy corridor for migrant arrival - last summer tweeted 'It's piling up' and labeled images of people's property 'burdensome trash'. But Quiroz said: 'It's not that they're [asylum seekers] leaving a mess. When Border Patrol shows up, they tell them to drop everything and get in line.' Some coalition volunteers began cleaning up the Yuma stretch of border. The county placed two large dumpsters nearby. They also persuaded border patrol to provide shade structures and water for arriving asylum seekers. But he claimed: 'Some politicians are disappointed because we cleaned it up. It's not the visual they want to see for the narrative they want to tell.' In some parts of Texas, so many belongings are left behind that border patrol use heavy machinery to 'shove it off into piles at the side of the road', said Scott Nicol, an environmental activist and artist based in McAllen, near the easternmost point of the US-Mexico border. He has also found personal and confidential documents on his walks along the border. 'What really got to me were the X-rays I found. They were for a six-year-old boy and showed a steel rod in his spine. It was obviously for an asylum claim. Why would anyone part with those?' he said. He said he has even found birth certificates 'torn into a hundred pieces and thrown into the brush'. The Guardian sent images of passports, birth certificates and other documents found at the border wall to Customs and Border Protection, the federal agency overseeing border agents, and requested comment on whether agents were telling asylum seekers to leave their documents behind, and in some cases ripping them up. CBP declined to respond to the questions. In an email, a CBP spokesperson replied that they 'could not speculate on the motivation of an individual discarding copies of personal vital statistic documentation'. When asked about the personal items left behind, CBP wrote in an email that border patrol has a 'policy prohibiting certain items deemed a health hazard, that includes wet or moldy clothes, from entering CBP facilities.' The spokesperson added: 'Items not deemed contraband, or a health hazard are stored and returned to the migrant upon release or will accompany them if transferred to the custody of another agency.' But increasingly people arrive at migrant shelters in the US with only the clothes on their backs, and without any identification. Joanna Williams, executive director of the Kino Border Initiative, a binational migrant advocacy organization that runs a shelter in Nogales, on the Mexican side of the border south of Tucson, Arizona, said one theory she's heard is that smugglers advise migrants to dump their identifying documents when they cross. But in the thousands of intake interviews with migrants the organization has done, Williams said, they've never once heard from someone who had left their documents behind because a smuggler told them to do so. 'The families that we see, who carry things related to their asylum cases, are very clear on the fact that these are important documents, and very concerned about them, if they get misplaced,' she said. However, after the Trump administration began its Remain in Mexico policy for many crossing the border unauthorized, some migrants told them agents ripped up their Mexican immigration visas and other documents. 'The agents would say that they were fake documents when they were actually real, and they really needed them,' she said. Blake Gentry, director of the indigenous language office at Casa Alitas, a migrant shelter in Tucson, estimated that about a third of people arrive at the shelter without documents or belongings. He suspects some agents are forcing migrants to dump their possessions in some sort of rogue practice. 'If this is happening on the US side of the wall, it's most likely Border Patrol,' he said.", "748c5d8def4c4a2b779c4c89f9d0c746cb736c63bb2e30032ae0bcfa": "The most expensive property on the Monopoly board is Mayfair, which also happens to be the most exclusive expanse of real estate in real-life London. Flush with private equity firms, eye-wateringly expensive restaurants and luxury car showrooms, it voted Labour in last week's local elections and helped swing Westminster council away from the Tories for the first time since the Beatles were in the charts with Can't Buy Me Love. Recent years have seen working-class strongholds in the north of England turning Tory, and now you have the even odder spectacle of the super-rich in London voting Labour. That says something about Labour's success in the capital but it also suggests that there is a growing divide between London and the rest of the country, where the party's performance was decidedly less impressive. Of course, most of London is not super-rich. Indeed, there are many deep pockets of poverty in the capital, but they tend to be multi-ethnic and multicultural, and they too vote Labour. Nevertheless, the overall story of London in the past 40 years is one of economic growth that has propelled the capital away from the day-to-day experience of large parts of the nation. Caroline Knowles, a professor of sociology at Goldsmiths University, has written a book on plutocratic London called Serious Money. 'There is undoubtedly a concentration of wealth in London,' she says. 'A while back some of my colleagues made a diagram we called the Fat Bottom Diagram. It depicts wealth in the UK, and the south-east has this huge bulge.' In a crude sense, the political map of the UK has traditionally followed the distribution of wealth, with Labour doing well in poor areas, and Conservatives laying claim to richer constituencies. There have always been exceptions to the rule, but London as a whole now seems intent on demonstrating its exceptionalism. In the past, Labour's wealthier supporters derived largely from the progressive middle-classes, that urban tribe that runs from social work through teaching to the creative industries and the law. The cliche of the metropolitan liberal elite is rooted in north London neighbourhoods like Hampstead and Islington, the natural habitat of the bien pensant professional. Although they are only a few miles away, they are a world apart from the suburban redoubt of Barnet, a Conservative stronghold that Labour had never won before Thursday. Equally, Wandsworth council had been staunchly Conservative since before Margaret Thatcher came to power. The Tories claimed a surprise victory in Harrow. Psephologists will be busy explaining these apparent anomalies, but whatever the local causes they form part of a global story. As the cultural commentator and co-author of The War Against the BBC, Peter York says: 'People in large significant cities are more likely to vote liberal-left, and people in smaller towns or rural communities are more likely to vote conservative. That's a rule right across America and Europe, and London is particularly subject to it because it is a supercity, a world city, the only world city in this country and really the only world city in Europe.' The question is whether the gravitational force of London's size and prominence distorts the rest of country, putting its nose figuratively out of joint, or instead sets a path for it to follow. Is it a benign liberal influence or a self-obsessed bubble that antagonises everywhere else that isn't London? York suspects that it's a mixture of push and pull, but he believes that London is 'completely out of whack with the rest of the country'. If that is an unhealthy position for a capital at the best of times, it's even more troubling when there is a post-Brexit culture and identity war raging. The image that London is able to project, or has projected upon it, is itself a battlefront in the argument between populists and progressives. Take, for example, the collapse of what we might call the 'Mayfair blue wall'. What does that signify? And how is it viewed outside the metropolis? The idea of hedge fund managers voting Labour - and York doubts that they did in any numbers - could well trigger provincial suspicions about the extent to which the party represents ordinary working people. Alternatively, it will give Conservatives pause for thought that a sector of society that has most benefited from Conservative rule - super-rich cosmopolitans - appears to have registered a protest against Boris Johnson's party. 'I think that the really wealthy don't like this particular brand of conservativism practised by the Conservative government,' says Knowles. 'It's narrow, misogynistic, nationalistic and inward-looking. And it's anti-Europe.' Although it's not unique to London, Brexit and its aftermath continue to reverberate in the capital. There is a kind of cultural hangover rather than any meaningful political resistance, a deep-lying frustration at how Middle England has turned its back on Europe, leaving London cut off from the continent over which it increasingly viewed itself as the unofficial capital. Monique Roffey, the Trinidadian-born novelist who won the Costa book of the year award last year for The Mermaid of Black Conch, says most of the young Londoners she meets remain angry at the older generation, in particular the older generation from outside London. 'They've de-Europeanised them,' she says, and the resentment at that altered status has not gone away. It's hard to imagine that these are the issues being urgently aired in the cafes of South Audley Street, but it may be that Mayfair is less different to the rest of London than London is to the rest of the country, at least in terms of cultural identity. 'The fact is London isn't like anywhere else in the country,' says Knowles. 'It's like central Paris or Manhattan. They're sort of islands that have more to do with each other than they have with the rest of their national hinterlands.' She believes that it has been a grave political mistake to allow this divide to grow. 'The whole idea of levelling up, which doesn't really work at all, has been a kind of grudging acknowledgment of that,' she says. London has long dwarfed other British cities, more so than any other European capital in relation to its provinces. Its disproportionate size has created a distinct political and cultural microclimate that has been intensified by the prevailing winds of globalism. London is not just a major city but a global one containing communities with origins in all corners of the planet. Today 40% of Londoners identify as non-white. The city's once renowned regional accent or dialect, Cockney has all but disappeared, to be replaced by a hybrid sociolect known as multicultural London English. It's as if a commitment to diversity and inclusivity has become encoded in the very language of the street. 'It's definitely more multicultural and tolerant,' says Roffey. 'That's why I've felt at home here as someone who's bi-cultural. You can blend in. London is somewhere that's dealt with and coped with immigration, absorption, riots, and more riots.' London, yes, but Barnet? It's hardly the frontline. Say the name to most Londoners and it will conjure visions of a leafy comfort zone safely removed from the turmoil of the inner city melting pot. The reality is rather more complex. For a start, black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups make up 48% of the population. These are communities - aspiring middle-class immigrants and their descendants - to which the Tories have successfully laid claim in the past by emphasising their commitment to entrepreneurialism and laissez faire community politics. When he was mayor of London, Johnson had the political knack of appealing to many different ethnic groups, playing up his cosmopolitan credentials, but his government's mood music has taken a discordant turn towards a more defensive and less open notion of Britain. That Labour can make inroads in places like Barnet suggests that the culture war which Johnson has been happy to tactically stoke has blown back in his face, at least in London. However, given the rocketing cost of living and the general sense of doom about events in the country, that may have paid dividends in limiting Conservative losses elsewhere. The problem is that there are two different national conversations going on - one within London and a few other urban centres and the other everywhere else - that never seem to interact. This kind of silo existence is familiar on social media, which encourages tribal thinking, but it's also becoming a more firmly established geographical phenomenon. For York, so many of the exchanges that take place as part of this cultural skirmish are based on a false narrative. 'When the Daily Mail bangs on about the imputed London-centric liberal elitism of the BBC, the fact is the BBC has 50% of its workforce outside London. Ask yourself, how much of the workforce of the Daily Mail is based outside London?' In any case, he argues, this tension between capital and provinces is an old story. 'Someone said that all those novels and plays of the 1950s really boil down to people getting on a train at a provincial railways station and going to London,' he says. 'It's a cultural, aspirational history of Britain. It oughtn't to be but that's how it is.' Perhaps, but in political terms it's the party that can ensure that it's not a one-way journey that will prevail. Just as Labour has to work out how to speak to its urban supporters and its traditional constituency in a language that makes sense to both, so too do the Tories. It's all very well bad-mouthing the metropolitan liberal elite or the inward-looking provinces but that's not a recipe for winning round those communities. Although economic levelling up is the obvious long-term answer, that seems to be a commitment that is stalled in the rhetorical phase, forever postponed by the worsening economic forecast. In the meantime, London and Not-London have to make the effort to understand each other, appreciate their respective strengths and weaknesses, and stop thinking of the other as the root of the nation's problems.", "88bab137184d08053540f891cf0a9a3d7502549d6cea12a798b6d24e": "", "f633d4eb5bfdc5c4e717abe7d635a2b79c581a78da9fa319fd05c1b5": "After a supreme court decision that overturns Roe v Wade was leaked and signaled the impending end of federal constitutional protection for abortions, a trickle of companies have slowly started to announce policies that provide abortion access for their employees. But while the protections may keep employees and consumers happy, the threat of retaliation from conservative lawmakers looms. Citigroup, one of the biggest banks in the US, quietly started covering the travel expenses of employees who want to get an abortion but are banned from getting one in their home state. The benefit was not announced publicly. Instead, the company mentioned the change in benefits in a March filing for shareholders. Once news outlets began to report on the new benefit, the Republican ire began. Conservatives in Congress asked House and Senate administrators to cancel its contract with the company, which issues credit cards to lawmakers to use for work-related flights, office supplies and other goods. A state lawmaker in Texas, infuriated by Citigroup, introduced a bill that would prevent companies from doing business with local governments in Texas if they provide abortion-related benefits to their employees. 'Citigroup decided to pander to the woke ideologues in its C-suite instead of obeying the laws of Texas,' said Briscoe Cain, the Texas state representative who introduced the bill, in a statement. 'We will enact laws necessary to prevent this misuse of shareholder money and hold Citigroup accountable for its violation of our state's abortion laws'. Citigroup has now been joined by Amazon, Apple, Yelp, Match Group, Tesla and Levi Strauss & Company, all which have said they will offer travel assistance to employees who are in states that restrict abortions. Insiders at JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs have told news outlets they too are considering similar policies. 'I expect there will be a significant shift and the most leading companies are going to recognize that they need to protect the healthcare of their employees,' said Shelley Alpern, director of shareholder advocacy at Rhia Ventures. 'Most companies would like to avoid taking a public stance on this issue because it's so controversial, but there are higher risks for companies when they don't protect their employees' healthcare access.' In today's heated political climate - and with midterm elections looming - corporate America can expect a fiery response to any stance it takes on Roe's fall. But given the widespread impact the end of Roe v Wade will have on much of the country - 26 states will restrict abortion access if the decision is overturned - it is unlikely that companies can get away with not responding to the issue once the supreme court makes its final decision. Neeru Paharia, an associate professor at Georgetown University McDonough School of Business, said that people expect more out of companies as trust in government has fallen. 'People are enacting their political will in the marketplace,' she said. For consumers, a purchase from a company can be a symbolic sign of support. For employees, their identities can be tied to the ethical positions of the company they work for. Over the last few years, corporate America has started to become more vocal on various issues that have gotten the attention of conservative lawmakers, including voting rights and LGBTQ+ issues. But conservative politicians have gotten bolder at fighting back against what they consider to be 'woke capitalism'. While the GOP has historically positioned itself as the business-friendly, tax-cutting political party, conservative lawmakers have been emboldened to threaten and punish companies who speak out on controversial issues. Last month, Florida's governor, Ron DeSantis, revoked special land use privileges the state gave to Disney for its Disney World theme park in Orlando after the company - responding to backlash from employees and consumers - spoke out against the state's 'don't say gay' law. The move appeared to catch people by surprise. Lloyd Blankfein, former Goldman Sachs CEO, tweeted that the move 'smacks of government retaliation for exercising free speech. Bad look for a conservative.' 'That was really shocking,' Paharia said. 'Now you have a situation where consumers and employees want companies to take a political stance, but then you have governments that are possibly retaliating against them.' When it comes to abortion, 'even though it might not be [explicitly] taking a side ... [companies] are taking a position based on the kind of benefits they are going to offer their employees'. The threats lawmakers have made have so far not come to fruition, but the party seems serious on trying to penalize companies in some way. The Republican senator Marco Rubio introduced a bill this week that would not allow companies to deduct abortion-related travel benefits as regular employee benefits when a company files its taxes. 'Our tax code should be pro-family and promote a culture of life,' he said in a statement. With these warnings, companies may try to keep the introduction of abortion-related quiet or downplay their significance. When Citigroup's CEO, Jane Fraser - the first woman to lead a major American bank - was asked in a shareholders meeting about the company's new abortion travel benefit, she said the benefit 'isn't intended to be a statement about a very sensitive issue'. 'What we did here was follow our past practices,' she said, adding that the company had 'covered reproductive healthcare benefits for over 20 years. And our practice has also been to make sure our employees have the same health coverage, no matter where in the US they live.' Jen Stark, senior director of corporate strategy at Tara Health Foundation, who helped coordinate the signatures of over 180 executives in a statement against abortion bans in 2019, said the potential backlash from conservative lawmakers proves that companies need to act on abortion restrictions beyond mitigating effects for their employees. 'They can buy all the plane tickets their workers need, and that addresses the immediate harm, but the structural deficiency is the collateral damage,' she said. 'The supreme court case didn't happen in a bubble ... you're kind of walking over the rubble.' Beyond benefits for employees, Stark has been advocating for companies to use their lobbying powers and scrutinize political donations as state lawmakers prepare to restrict abortions. 'We are at the moment everyone's cried wolf about. It's here, but there was also a lot of headwind,' she said. 'What companies can do with a stroke of a pen to mitigate some of the harm is important, but the larger issue is getting out of this structural whirlpool that we're in.'", "6b8afcc3179d52c3899f7bd226cd881fbe7eef73b1bf5aede59c3af6": "Ujarneq Egede's farm sits among a cluster of compact houses and squat barns on the snowy slopes of Equaluit Ilua in southern Greenland. The journey from Narsaq, the nearest town, involves a 30 minute boat trip across the fjord, mooring on a sheet of ice and a snowmobile ride up to the farm. This is the biggest island in the world, yet Greenland's population is tiny - less than 57,000 of whom nearly 90% are Inuit, concentrated around the jagged coastline. The country's remoteness is extreme: there are no roads or railways between towns and settlements. Transport is only by boat, helicopter and propeller planes - ice, winds and storms permitting. Narsaq itself is a small town of about 1,300 people, where jobs revolve around fishing, farming, a slaughterhouse and summer tourism. Its population has fallen 25% since 1991. Meanwhile, on his farm, Egede grows potatoes and raises 750 sheep, huddled in barns during the winter and ranging across the grassy mountains throughout summer. To be a farmer in Greenland is to have a front row seat to the climate crisis. Egede tracks the changes - 'summer is sometimes really dry, other times there is too much rain. This winter was really late'. Where once they could drive on the frozen fjord during winter, now that never happens, he says. It is not just climate that worries him, however. Egede's farm is in the shadow of Kvanefjeld, a proposed open-pit uranium and rare earth elements mine. Fearing what it may do to the surrounding environment and his farm, he was immensely relieved when plans for the mine were recently halted after the new government, elected in April 2021, banned uranium mining. But the threat still simmers. Egede is not sure it isover. This southern slice of Greenland, where the main sources of employment include farming, fishing and tourism, has found itself at the sharp end of a quandary the country is reckoning with: how to develop the economy without doing so at the expense of its environment and its people, who rely on the pristine Arctic landscape for their livelihoods. In its own, Greenland way, it is a microcosm of the dilemma facing huge parts of the world. Melting ice sheets and fast-warming temperatures make Greenland a totem for the climate crisis. But as the ice melts, ironically enough, opportunities arise: not only are raw materials easier to access but Greenland is becoming more accessible and tourist seasons are extending. The relatively young government came to power in April 2021 promising pro-environmental policies: it has pledged to join the Paris climate agreement and has banned new licences for oil and gas drilling. But Greenland's abundant minerals have attracted the attention of countries that are currently dependent on China and Russia for the raw materials needed to build the batteries and wind turbines of the low-carbon economy. Mining may mean Greenland could move away from its financial dependence on Denmark, which gives it a grant of 3.9bn Danish krone (PS440m) every year, and towards eventual independence. In Narsaq, the Australian-based Greenland Minerals pitched the Kvanefjeld mine as a source of local opportunity. The pitch failed to impress many, including farmers such as Egede, and Naasu Lund, who lives with her husband and two children on a sheep farm in Inneruulalik, near Narsaq. Lund was part of the anti-mine group Urani? Naamik (Uranium? No). Farmers thought they would be forced to move from farms that had been in their families for generations, says Lund, who also runs horse riding tours from her hydropowered farm. The biggest concern was the tailings pond holding the mining waste, she says, which would remain there for ever. People feared it could spill in Greenland's fierce weather, reaching the fjord in minutes. Urani? Naamik protested - at public consultations, through local campaigning and finally through votes. And it worked. 'This is the first time I can sit in my home and think about a future that is not involved with mining,' Lund says. Whether the mine is over is uncertain, however. Greenland Minerals has launched arbitration proceedings to 'clarify the company's position and to protect our shareholders' considerable investment in Kvanefjeld', according to a spokesperson, who added that a detailed environmental impact assessment had addressed all concerns about the mine. 'Even under the most extreme assumptions there would not be any exceedance of WHO drinking water standards resulting from dispersal of tailings material during foehn winds [strong gusty winds].' While Greenland's government may be saying no to uranium, it is open to other mining and the warming climate may make projects more feasible. 'Mineral deposits are exposed that had previously been under ice,' says Josephine Nymand of the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources. In March, Kobold Minerals, which has investment from Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates, and the UK-based Bluejay Mining announced they would begin exploring for nickel, copper, cobalt and platinum group metals. Bo Stensgaard, the CEO of Bluejay Mining, says the project will operate to the 'highest standards' environmentally and benefit Greenlanders through jobs and training. But there is no timeframe for when mining might start. Herein lies the problem, says Lill Rastad Bjorst, associate professor at Aalborg University - there is a lot of talk but 'close to nothing is happening'. Greenland currently has only two mines, one producing rubies and another anorthosite. Despite claims about how Greenlanders benefit from mining, 'at the moment, there might be people who benefit from this development, but it's not the people living in Greenland', Bjorst says. Could tourism be the answer? 'We advocate for tourism,' says Idrissia Thestrup, of Visit Greenland, 'because we believe by preserving nature, we can actually avoid taking the resources in the land and potentially destroying landscapes.'  Tourism was one of the country's fastest growing industries until Covid lockdowns brought it to a shuddering halt. But 2022 will be a boom year, says Henrik Ebbe Nielsen, a tourism teacher at Campus Kujalleq, in Qaqortoq, south Greenland's largest town. Qaqortoq alone expects to see an estimated 41 cruise ships this summer, spilling up to 47,000 tourists on to its winding, pavement-less streets. Visitor numbers may be boosted further by an airport expansion project. Qaqortoq will get a brand new airport, with construction starting this spring, and new runways will allow larger, international planes to land in the capital, Nuuk, and Ilulissat, a town famed for its iceberg-calving glacier and dog sledding. But bigger airports mean more aeroplanes, more emissions and more tourists. In some areas, 'the local landscape is very much affected by too many tourists already', says Bjorst. Thestrup says framing Greenland's airport growth as a climate problem ignores its tiny contribution to the climate crisis and its extreme remoteness. But she acknowledges the need to tread carefully. 'We want tourism to be a driver for economic growth but we want to do it at a pace that respects the nature and culture of our destination.' Greenland's prime minister, Mute B Egede, recently set out his vision for a 'resilient economy', one that would ultimately phase out fossil fuels. Alongside fishing, rare earth mining and tourism, he predicts a future for far less tested industries, including using Greenland's abundant hydropower resources with captured CO2 emissions to create green fuels for export. 'As the 'face' of climate change,' he wrote in an editorial, 'Greenland wants to lead by example.' For now, the country is trying to plot a path towards increased economic freedom, while staking its claim for climate leadership. It is a path filled with uncertainty, especially as the climate crisis starts to alter people's way of life, but uncertainty is something Greenlanders are used to. 'You cannot sit down and cry, it doesn't help, you have to just adapt,' Lund says. 'We can do it right,' she adds. 'Greenland is a very sustainable country but it's also the Arctic - nature doesn't fix itself very fast after being destroyed, you have to be careful, it's very fragile.'

About 90 people had been sheltering in that school at the time of the attack.  Antonio Guterres, secretary-general of the United Nations, issued a statement Sunday saying he was 'appalled' by the attack on the school.  'This attack is yet another reminder that in this war, as in so many other conflicts, it is civilians that pay the highest price,' said Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for the secretary-general.

'For a country heavily dependent on energy imports, it's a very difficult decision. But G7 coordination is most important at a time like now,' Kishida told reporters according to Reuters, repeating comments he made at the G7 meeting.  He did not elaborate. The G7 nations committed to the move 'in a timely and orderly fashion' at an online meeting on Sunday to put further pressure on president Vladimir Putin, although members such as resource-poor Japan depend heavily on Russian fuel. There have been no ships loading Russian oil for Japan since mid-April, according to Refinitiv data. About 1.9 million barrels were exported from Russia to Japan in April, 33% down from the same month a year ago. The Ukraine crisis has highlighted Japan's energy dependence on Russia even as Tokyo has acted swiftly and in tandem with the G7 in instituting sanctions. The latest ban underlines a turn in Japan's policy. Japan has said it would be difficult to immediately cut off Russian oil imports, which accounted for about 33 million barrels of Japan's overall oil imports, or 4%, for 2021. It has already said it will ban Russian coal imports in stages, leaving just liquefied natural gas (LNG). Japan is in a particularly tough spot since it shut down the bulk of its nuclear reactors following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. Russia was Japan's fifth-biggest supplier of crude oil and LNG last year. A Fiji court has suspended the execution of a US warrant to seize a $300 million super yacht Washington claims is owned by sanctioned Russian oligarch Suleiman Kerimov, prosecutors have said according to AFP. The 348-foot Amadea has been targeted because Kerimov is among a group of oligarchs close to Moscow who have been sanctioned by the United States over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The yacht remains in Fiji police custody and is blocked from leaving the Pacific nation's waters despite the warrant suspension, prosecutors said. The luxurious Amadea - which has a helipad, pool, jacuzzi and 'winter garden' on its sun deck, according to tracking website superyachtfan.com - has been berthed in Lautoka, Fiji in the South Pacific since mid-April. Last week, Fijian law enforcement, backed by US agents, took control of the super yacht under the warrant, which was lodged with the island state's High Court. The US Justice Department requested the vessel, which it has estimated to be valued at $300 million, be seized for violating sanctions and for alleged ties to corruption. But the company officially registered as the Amadea's owner, Millemarin Investment, on Friday obtained a temporary stay on the US warrant's execution from the Court of Appeal, Fiji prosecutors said. The Court of Appeal 'granted an interim stay on the execution of the warrant', a spokeswoman for Fiji's office of the director of public prosecutions told AFP on Monday. The case is scheduled to return to court on Thursday and the US warrant remains officially registered with the Fiji courts, she said. 'The yacht has been further restrained from leaving the Fiji waters until further notice,' she added. 'It is in Fiji police custody at this point.' The UK government has expanded its sanctions against Russia to include punitive import tariffs on Russian precious metals, as well as export bans on certain UK products, to increase economic pressure on Moscow over the invasion of Ukraine, Guardian business reporter Joanna Partridge writes. For more, read on here:  Here's a bit more from Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, who gave an interview to Reuters during his unannounced visit to Ukraine on Sunday, telling the newswire the world would do everything possible to ensure that Russian president Vladimir Putin loses his war in Ukraine, including keeping Moscow under sanctions for years. 'What Putin needs to understand is that the west is absolutely determined and resolved to stand against what he is doing,' Trudeau said. Speaking on the sidelines of an unannounced visit to Ukraine for talks with president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whom he calls a friend, Trudeau said Putin was making a terrible mistake. 'He is inflicting atrocities upon civilians, and it's all something that he is doing because he thought he could win. But he can only lose,' Trudeau said when asked what he would tell Putin on the eve of Russia's commemorations of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War Two, which Moscow calls the Great Patriotic War of 1941-45. Trudeau also echoed a statement from the Group of Seven issued earlier on Sunday, following a video call of G7 leaders with Zelinskiy, on how Putin's 'actions bring shame on Russia and the historic sacrifices of its people' during the second world war. Earlier, Trudeau said Canada would provide new weapons and equipment for Ukraine and will reopen its embassy in Kyiv, the country's capital. Trudeau said all the countries that have imposed sanctions on Moscow, which have taken a steep toll on the Russian economy, are determined to keep them in place as long as necessary, even for years. Ukraine's counteroffensive northeast of Kharkiv has likely forced Russian troops to redeploy to the city instead of reinforcing stalled Russian offensive operations elsewhere in eastern Ukraine, the Institute of War has said in its latest analysis of the conflict. Russian forces were also continuing their attempt to reach the administrative borders of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts but have not made substantial territorial gains since securing Popasna on Saturday, the US-based think tank added. Other potential developments to look out for were: President Volodymyr Zelenskiy presented Ukraine's famous mine sniffing dog Patron and his owner with a medal on Sunday to recognise their dedicated service since Russia's invasion, Reuters has reported. The pint-size Jack Russell terrier has been credited with detecting more than 200 explosives and preventing their detonation since the start of the war on 24 February, quickly becoming a canine symbol of Ukrainian patriotism. Zelenskiy made the award at a news conference in Kyiv with Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. Patron barked and wagged his tail, prompting laughter from the audience. Trudeau patted his pockets as though looking for a dog treat. 'Today, I want to award those Ukrainian heroes who are already clearing our land of mines. And together with our heroes, a wonderful little sapper - Patron - who helps not only to neutralise explosives, but also to teach our children the necessary safety rules in areas where there is a mine threat,' Zelenskiy said in a statement after the ceremony. The award also went to Patron's owner, a major in the Civil Protection Service, Myhailo Iliev. An update from one of the Guardian's correspondents in Ukraine, Emma Graham Harrison, on the evacuees from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol: Read on here:  The Guardian's Ed Ram has managed to take some pictures of the civilians evacuated from the Azovstal steelworks to Zaporizhzhia: Vladimir Putin's regime is 'mirroring' the actions of the Nazis, the UK's defence secretary, Ben Wallace, will say as the Russian leader stages a military parade to celebrate victory over Hitler's fascists, according to an advance copy of the speech. In a speech on Monday, Wallace will say president Putin and his inner circle should share the same fate as the Nazis, who ended up defeated and facing the Nuremberg trials for their atrocities. In Moscow, Putin will watch the Victory Day parade of military hardware, marking the defeat of the Nazis in 1945. According to extracts briefed to the Telegraph and Times, Wallace will say: 'Through their invasion of Ukraine, Putin, his inner circle and generals are now mirroring the fascism and tyranny of 70 years ago, repeating the errors of last century's totalitarian regimes. 'Their fate must also, surely, eventually be the same.' Read on here in this report by PA's political editor David Hughes: Hello, this is Helen Livingstone taking over from my colleague Vivian Ho to bring you the latest developments from the conflict in Ukraine. 'Russia will lose, because evil always loses,' Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said in his latest nightly address on Sunday, 8 May, when Ukraine marks the end of the second world war with its remembrance and reconciliation day. Russia marks its second world war Victory Day on 9 May, Zelenskiy noted, 'when peace should be the main word. For all normal people.' But he said, Russia had killed about 60 people in a 'targeted' airstrike on a school in Luhansk, while another missile struck a residential building in the Odesa region. There was further shelling in the regions Sumy, the Donbas and Kharkiv. He also thanked Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, who along with several other western leaders visited Kyiv on Sunday, saying that they had agreed to expand economic and defence cooperation and Canada had made the 'extremely important decision' to remove all barriers to trade for one year. He also said that Canada had 'a strong potential in mine clearance' and that 'we expect that this potential will be used in Ukraine - where the Russian occupiers left thousands of mines, tripwire mines, shells.' Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada, was one of several western leaders who made a surprise visit to Ukraine today. During his visit, he announced that Canada would be providing an additional $50m in military assistance.  US first lady Jill Biden met today with Olena Zelenska, wife of Volodymyr Zelenskiy, outside a public school in Uzhhorod. Here are some photos:  Volodymyr Zelenskiy confirmed late Sunday what many had feared but were hoping would not be true: 60 people who were sheltering in the Bilohorivka school that Russian forces bombed this weekend were killed in the attack.  About 90 people had been sheltering in that school at the time of the attack.  Antonio Guterres, secretary-general of the United Nations, issued a statement Sunday saying he was 'appalled' by the attack on the school.

Read more here:  After today's successful arrival in Zaporizhzhia, the total number of people evacuated from Azovstal and Mariupol is now more than 600.  Mykhaylo Podolyak, aide to president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Twitter that they 'won't stop until we evacuate all our people' from Azovstal. 'The life of every defender is sacred to the Ukrainian state,' he said.  'Every conversation of the president with the leaders of the world begins with the word 'Azovstal',' Podolyak said. 'We calculate all formats, and if the history of international law does not know such formats - we offer new ones. We managed to get women and children out of the factory, but we will not stop until we get everyone out.' Kyiv has responded to Berlin police confiscating a Ukrainian flag today in Germany.  To recap: with tensions heightened on the anniversary of Nazi Germany's surrender in World War II, the city of Berlin decided to suppress all public displays of support of the Russian invasion of Ukraine - everything from Russian flags to the beeping of horns at car rallies. Officials included Ukrainian flags under this decision, and earlier today police were filmed confiscating a large flag.  After weeks of living under siege, more than 170 civilians from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol have arrived in Zaporizhzhia.  Volodymyr Zelenskiy said yesterday that more than 300 civilians had been rescued from Azovstal. But Reuters is reporting that captain Sviatoslav Palamar, a deputy commander of Ukraine's Azov regiment, cannot say for certain if all civilians have been evacuated from the plant as Ukrainian fighters are not able to check and clear all the bombed areas.", "846b2fd04cc028c3396f9798faf8883d5812d50a3c67f0ea74380d7b": "Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine has brought shame on Russia and the sacrifices its people made to defeat Nazi Germany in the second world war, leaders of the G7 group of leading western economies have said in a statement marking the 77th anniversary of the end of the global conflict. The statement, made on Sunday after a video conference between the G7 leaders and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was intended as a rallying call by liberal democracies in advance of Russia's 9 May Victory Day parade in Moscow. The G7 statement said: 'Through its invasion of and actions in Ukraine since 2014, Russia has violated the international rules-based order, particularly the UN charter, conceived after the second world war to spare successive generations from the scourge of war. 'President Putin and his regime now chose to invade Ukraine in an unprovoked war of aggression against a sovereign country. His actions bring shame on Russia and the historic sacrifices of its people.' The leaders also accused him of 'an attack on feeding the world' if he did not comply with international law and end the blockade on Ukrainian food exports. The G7 said it had collectively provided Ukraine with $24bn (PS19.5) for financial and material support since the war started. Separately, in a televised address to the German people, Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, vowed Germany would not be paralysed by fear nor allow Russia to dictate the terms of any peace deal in Ukraine. In the joint statement the G7 leaders said they would collectively end their dependence on Russian energy 'in a timely and orderly way', but no precise timetable was set, reflecting the continued divisions in Europe about the speed with which such a phaseout can be achieved. In a clarification of war aims, the G7 statement said: 'Ukraine's ultimate aim is to ensure full withdrawal of Russia's military forces and equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine and to secure its ability to protect itself in the future.' Downing Street said that in his contribution to the G7 discussion, Boris Johnson urged his counterparts to supply the Ukrainians with 'military equipment that allowed them to not just hold ground in Ukraine, but recapture it'. Johnson 'agreed with G7 leaders that the world must intensify economic pressure on Putin in any way possible, and said the west must not allow the war to turn into a stalemate that only magnified suffering', a Downing Street spokesperson said. Johnson also urged his G7 partners to 'intensify their diplomatic lobbying of counterparts failing to apply pressure on President Putin's war machine', No 10 said. Talks between diplomats in Brussels continued on Sunday to try to secure EU wide unanimity on a timetable for a phaseout of Russian energy, but the discussions were described as hard going. Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic have been offered permission to continue importing Russian oil until the end of 2024, but they also want help securing new sources of oil and retooling their refineries. Budapest wants a five-year period to wean itself off Russian oil and says it will need a new pipeline connection with Croatia, which has access to the sea. The diplomatic activity came as the US first lady, Jill Biden, made a detour from her trip to Slovakia and Romania to visit refugees on an unannounced visit to Ukraine, where she met her Ukrainian counterpart, Olena Zelenska. On a busy day for VIP visits in Ukraine, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, toured Irpin, a Kyiv suburb and scene of some of the worst early attacks by Russia. The president of the German Bundestag, Barbel Bas, and the Croatian prime minister, Andrej Plenkovic, met Zelenskiy in Kyiv on Sunday. In the Kyiv metro, the Edge and Bono from U2, at the invitation of Zelenskiy, performed alongside a Ukrainian soldier. Bas is the most senior German politician to visit the capital. She took part in commemorative events on the anniversary of the end of the second world war, as well as discussing the vexed issue of German arms exports to Ukraine. It is expected that the German foreign minister, Annalea Baerbock, a surprise advocate of arms exports, will go to Ukraine shortly. Irpin's mayor, Oleksandr Markushyn, posted pictures on an official social media channel with Trudeau, writing that the Canadian prime minister 'came to Irpin to see with his own eyes all the horror that the Russian occupiers had done to our city'. Markushyn said Trudeau 'saw - not military facilities - but burned and completely destroyed homes of Irpin residents, who until recently enjoyed life and had their own plans for the future'. On Monday Emmanuel Macron, the French president, will travel to Berlin for talks with Scholz and to make a major address.", "e6dce55ca0908e446fe5f23dd2a40c5f02e42e8d1fd0685a99614407": "The US has unveiled a new layer of sanctions on Russia, targeting services, Russia's propaganda machine and its defence industry on the eve of Vladimir Putin's planned Victory Day parade. The new measures were announced as leaders from the G7 group of industrialised democracies held a virtual summit with Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a show of solidarity. They are primarily intended to close loopholes in the existing sanctions and to tighten the noose around the Russian economy by another few notches. The new sanctions include: The Biden administration sees US service providers as potential tools Russia could use to sidestep the punitive measures already imposed. 'They've been asked by Russian companies to help them figure out how to reformulate their business strategies in the wake of sanctions, in some cases how to get around these sanctions, or in the case of accountants how to hide some of their wealth, and we're shutting that down,' a senior administration official said. Like the UK, the restrictive measures do not apply to lawyers, but the US official said that could change, and that Washington and London are coordinating their moves in that respect. 'We made a judgment at least for now, that if there was a desire to seek due process through a US lawyer, we would allow that to continue,' the official said. 'But we're reevaluating the breadth of these services sanctions every day, and depending on how we see behavior change over time, we can certainly broaden the sanctions.' The new media sanctions will target three Kremlin-controlled propaganda outlets: Channel One, Russia-1 and NTV. American companies will no longer be allowed to sell equipment like video cameras or microphones to them, and US advertising on their channels will be banned. Last year, US companies bought $300m in advertising in the Russian market. 'A lot of these advertisers have announced since the invasion that they're going to cut their business activity with these stations, but we want to make sure that decision endures and just send a broader signal that US companies should not be in the business of funding Russian propaganda,' senior a senior administration official briefing the press ahead of the announcement. The new technology export bans on industrial items such as heavy engines and bulldozers are intended to have an impact on Russian war efforts by hitting the supply chain for defence manufacturers. The US claims that Russia two major Russian tank plants, Uralvagonzavod Corporation and Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant, have already been forced to halt production due to a lack of foreign components. The 2,600 new visa restrictions on individuals include military officials and Russian proxies deemed to have played a part in the invasion and there will be a new visa policy which would apply automatically to military or proxy officials involved in human rights abuses. The targeted sanctions will also hit eight executives from Sberbank, Russian's largest financial institution, and 27 from Gazprombank, owned by Russia's giant gas industry. Until now Gazprombank has been left untouched because of its role in facilitating European purchases of Russian natural gas. 'This is not a full block. We're not freezing the assets of Gazprom bank or prohibiting any transaction with Gazprombank,' the senior administration official said. 'What we're signaling is that Gazprombank is not a safe haven, so we're sanctioning some of their top business executives, people who sit at the top of the organization, to create a chilling effect.'", "c5cf2864e06838aa98d3660a0400067b4ae1c904288eacc27c60fa7b": "", "1d3c86d29d9bdc92402fc014773bffecd761aedcf3f6f9ea90bf4afa": "Sixty people have been killed after a village school in eastern Ukraine took a direct hit in a Russian air raid, with rescue attempts said by the regional governor to be impossible due to constant shelling. Russian attacks in the east and south intensified at the weekend ahead of Monday's symbolic Victory Day celebrations, with the Black Sea city of Odesa coming under repeated missile strikes and the remaining Ukrainian fighters in the Azovstal steelworks in the besieged port city of Mariupol staging a press conference on Sunday saying they had been 'abandoned' by the government as Russian attacks continued About 90 people had been using the school in Bilohorivka, a village 60 miles (97km) north-west of the Russian-controlled city of Luhansk, as a shelter after the previous place of refuge, a clubhouse, had been destroyed in an earlier attack. 'As a result of a Russian strike on Bilohorivka in the Luhansk region, about 60 people were killed, civilians, who simply hid at the school, sheltering from shelling,' the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in his nightly video address on Sunday. Serhiy Gaidai, the Luhansk governor, told the Guardian he believed the 30 people who escaped had been outside in the grounds of the building. He said he had little hope for those who were under rubble. 'Unfortunately, they are probably dead,' he said. 'Because the building collapsed. Besides, an air bomb is not a missile, its explosion produces extremely high temperatures. That's why most likely people haven't survived.' Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, has stated he intends to take the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions by 9 May when Russia marks Victory Day and the defeat of Nazi Germany in the second world war. In an address to mark Ukraine's 8 May remembrance and reconciliation day, Zelenskiy said his country paid homage to all those who helped defeat Adolf Hitler but accused Russia of repeating his crimes. He said: 'Every year on 8 May, together with the entire civilised world, we honour everyone who defended the planet from Nazism during world war two. Millions of lost lives, crippled destinies, tortured souls and millions of reasons to say to evil: never again! 'We knew the price our ancestors paid for this wisdom. We knew how important it is to preserve it and pass it on to posterity. But we had no idea that our generation would witness the desecration of the words, which, as it turned out, are not the truth for everyone. 'This year we say 'Never again' differently. We hear 'Never again' differently. It sounds painful, cruel. Without an exclamation, but with a question mark. You say: never again? Tell Ukraine about it.' Zelenskiy went on: 'On 24 February, the word 'never' was erased. Shot and bombed. By hundreds of missiles at 4am, which woke up the entire Ukraine. We heard terrible explosions. We heard: again!' Illya Samoilenko, a lieutenant in the Azov regiment in Mariupol, said his fellow soldiers would be executed if captured by the Russians and that surrender would be a 'gift' to the enemy. 'We are witnesses of Russian crimes,' he said, from the city's Azovstal steelworks. 'Surrender is not an option because Russia is not interested in our lives.' Meanwhile, the last civilians rescued from the besieged complex reached safety in Ukrainian held territory late on Sunday evening. The journey of just over 200km took two days, as the convoy of buses was held for hours at Russian checkpoints and those inside interrogated. There were 51 civilians who had been sheltering in the Azovstal complex, and around 120 others who had walked or hitched lifts across the city to a pickup point in a ruined shopping mall. 'I didn't think we would make it out alive, so I don't have any plans for my future,' said Natalia, who worked for Azovstal all her adult life and then sheltered for over two month in its network of bunkers. Gaidai said the attack on the school in Bilohorivka had taken place at 6pm on Saturday night and had been followed by a constant barrage in the surrounding area that had made rescue attempts impossible. He said a bus had been sent to the village, which has a population of 800 to 900 people, to evacuate the remaining residents on Sunday morning but it had to turn round due to the ferocity of the shelling on the roads. Gaidai said: 'Right now they are asking us, begging us to get them out, but we can't because everything is now under shelling. Around 70 people wanted to be evacuated today. We sent a bus, but it turned around and went back. Not just the village, but also a highway is under shelling.' Gaidai said he had been frustrated in recent weeks that the residents had repeatedly refused to leave despite the growing dangers to their lives as Russia has focused its attacks in the east and south of Ukraine. Earlier on Saturday, eight miles (13km) north of the school, two children died and a further two children and an elderly woman were injured when a missile hit the village of Pryvole, Gaidai said. He said: 'Around a week ago we tried to evacuate around 300 people from Bilohorivka. We'd already settled this, and sent a few buses. But most of them refused to go. So we managed to evacuate only 60-70 people.' Ukraine's prosecutor general said that as of 8 May, 225 Ukrainian children had died since Russian launched its invasion on 24 February.", "f630c17ce83cd2a7abcfc7afa59ab8d06b6bebe927f6a8194b03ab2c": "Jorge, a community activist from Colombia's conflict-ridden Choco province, was already traveling to the city of Medellin when he heard news that made him turn back towards home. Paramilitary militiamen in balaclavas and military fatigues had thrown up a string of roadblocks and declared an 'armed strike', torching vehicles, forcing businesses to close, and stopping all traffic. 'There's absolutely no one around, because any vehicle they find on the roads they set on fire,' said Jorge, using a false name to avoid any reprisals. 'It's total terror.' Since Thursday, cities, towns and villages across northern Colombia have been shut down by the feared Gulf Clan drug cartel, in retaliation for the extradition to the United States of its former leader, Dairo Antonio Usuga, better known as Otoniel. Otoniel faces a litany of drug-trafficking charges in the US, as well as over 120 charges in Colombia - including allegations of murder, illegal recruitment, kidnapping for ransom, sexual abuse of minors, terrorism, illegal possession of weapons and drug trafficking. But even as prosecutors in New York boasted that the alleged kingpin would finally face justice, Colombians across a swath of the country remained hostage to the terror unleashed by his thousands of henchmen. Militiamen have blocked main roads and forbidden everyone to venture out, even to buy food. 'Everything has been shut down since midday on Thursday, practically every single business is now closed,' said one resident in Apartado, a city of 200,000 people in the Uraba region, where the Gulf Clan still holds territory. 'We don't know how long this will go on. The water and power keeps going out, there's no transport, and food is running low. We just have to wait and see what happens.' Videos shared by residents with the Guardian show streets that normally teem with commerce were now completely deserted. 'The state has no control here, so in any moment armed groups can make trouble and destabilise the entire region,' said one community leader in Monteria, the capital of the province of Cordoba. 'Entire municipalities are shut down, buses have been burned, and nobody can leave their homes.' A threatening flyer in the name of the Gaitanist Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AGC) - the name the cartel uses for itself - have been distributed in several towns, stating that the armed strike will last for four days, and that the cartel will not be held responsible for the 'consequences that could be unfavourable'. Shops, schools and government buildings were graffitied with the AGC's insignia. 'We are the prisoners, not Otoniel,' said another resident of a village in the region. 'Everyone is confined to their homes, and nothing - not even an ambulance - moves. This is a silent chaos.' Otoniel's capture was hailed by US and Colombian authorities as a major blow against narcotraffickers, but police say that two of his lieutenants, known as Gonzalito and Chiquito Malo, have taken command of the militia, which is believed to have as many as 2,000 fighters, and in addition to drug trafficking is also involved in people trafficking, extortion, kidnapping for ransom, and forced recruitment of children. Colombian authorities have responded to the violence by launching an 'anti-terrorism policy', principally aimed at lifting roadblocks. 'The instruction to commanders is to deploy all their capabilities, and especially to be on the offensive against these criminals,' said a police spokesperson on Friday morning. Analysts say the terror in northern Colombia is a predictable consequence of the country's hardline tactics in the 'war on drugs', which often overlook civilian populations living among traffickers. 'This is a perfect demonstration of what the problem is with Colombia's approach to groups like the Clan del Golfo, in the sense that decapitating them with these large-scale, high-profile arrests like that of Otoniel have done nothing to affect the structure of the organisation,' said Elizabeth Dickinson, a Colombia analyst with the International Crisis Group, a thinktank. 'The daily reality in regions they control or contest continues to involve high levels of social control, a forced recruitment, coercion, extortion.' 'All of that is invisible, but in a moment like this, it becomes impossible for the state to ignore the depth of presence of a group like the Clan del Golfo in this region,' Dickinson said. 'It's actually quite shocking.'", "b4e306f34c822b85984040ebfb51b09667f038f8ff8ca53a78cfa299": "A mesmerised hush fell over the crowd as Joao Camarero took to the stage with his seven-string guitar and plucked the opening notes of a national anthem that has become a symbol of the political struggle for Brazil's soul. 'O land adored above all others, 'tis thee, Brazil,' sang the South American songstress beside him, Teresa Cristina, as thousands of spectators added their voices to the hymn's call for a future of liberty and love. Behind the musicians stood the man the audience hoped could make that dream reality: the former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who on Saturday announced he would seek to return to power in October's election so as to end what he called Jair Bolsonaro's era of tyranny, destruction and hate. 'Brazil needs to go back to being a normal country,' the 76-year-old leftwinger told elated supporters at a rally in Sao Paulo, many visibly moved by the rendition of a national anthem that has been appropriated by Bolsonaro's far-right movement and which, along with the presidency, progressive Brazilians want to reclaim. It was time, Lula declared, for Brazil to decide whether it wished to be a country of democracy or authoritarianism; truth or lies; tolerance or obscurantism; education or automatic rifles; environmental preservation or depredation.  'Never was it easier to choose - and never was it so important to make the right choice,' he said. There was euphoria below the stage as the former president, who governed from 2003 to 2011, outlined plans to build a more stable and compassionate country from the wreckage of Bolsonaro's 'reckless and criminal' rule under which Amazon deforestation has soared and more than 660,000 lives been lost to Covid-19. 'I feel I'm part of history ... and we feel happy to be on the right side of history,' said Maria de Lourdes, a retired bank clerk who clutched a crepe paper flower symbolising her yearning for change. Polls suggest Lula should comfortably beat Bolsonaro, a Donald Trump-admiring nationalist whose radical rhetoric and calamitous coronavirus response mean he is abominated by many of Brazil's 215 million citizens. But analysts, and Lula allies, say Bolsonaro is a formidable political opponent with a ferociously loyal support base representing perhaps 25% of voters. To ensure victory, they believe the former president must build an invincible pro-democracy coalition stretching all the way from the hard-left to the centre-right. 'It's important not just that Lula wins, but that Bolsonaro loses badly,' said the political columnist Celso Rocha de Barros, who fears that in the event of a narrow Lula victory Bolsonaro will refuse to concede, alleging fraud, and launch a coup to supposedly 'reestablish democracy'. Lula's mission advanced at the weekend with the unveiling of his anti-Bolsonaro alliance, Vamos Juntos Pelo Brasil (Let's Pull Together for Brazil). The bloc includes seven leftwing and centre-left parties and hopes to expand before the vote on 2 October. As a gesture of his unifying intentions, Lula named Geraldo Alckmin, the centre-right former governor of Sao Paulo and a one-time presidential rival, as his running mate. The Guardian last interviewed Alckmin in 2006 and the moderate conservative was trekking through Rio's largest favela in search of votes to defeat Lula in that year's presidential election. 'Brazil has not grown,' Alckmin said of Lula's first term in power, blaming his opponent for economic stagnation. Times have changed. On Saturday, Alckmin urged voters to back his once-improbable partnership with Brazil's first working-class leader. 'Lula ... isn't the first, second or third way,' Alckmin said. 'He's the only way [to end] the most disastrous and cruel government' in Brazilian history. Randolfe Rodrigues, a progressive senator who is part of Lula's campaign team and tipped as a future minister, vowed to work tirelessly to build a multi-party alliance against Bolsonaro, a former paratrooper who openly celebrates the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985. 'Today was a starting point. Now we need to bring together all democrats,' Rodrigues said, claiming Bolsonaro's relentless threats against Brazil's young democracy meant the coming vote represented an extraordinary crossroads, for Brazil and the world. '2022 isn't an election like all of those which Brazil has held since the return of democracy. In none of the previous elections ... was Brazilian democracy at stake,' Rodrigues said. 'In 2022, it is.' As Lula supporters streamed out of the auditorium and a giant Brazilian flag - another national symbol leftwingers are trying to wrestle back from the right - was removed from the stage, Rodrigues urged his country to seek inspiration from France, where rival politicians recently pulled together to defeat the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen in presidential elections. 'Macron's victory was a balm for us Brazilians - the French gave us a great example that we must follow here in terms of tolerance and unity,' he said. Rodrigues said the world was 'living through a species of fascist international, represented by Trump in the United States, [Viktor] Orban in Hungary and [Vladimir] Putin in Russia'. Defeating that movement's South American representative had global significance. 'This is a civilising mission,' he said.", "406ec78caacddeee708fd5313ca6b7e7001947fe7b1b3391113046db": "Working out of the kitchen of their small restaurant in Ontario in the 1970s, Irene Demas and her husband Tony soon learned the value of trading their dishes for the talents of local bakers, craftspeople and artisans. 'Everyone supported everyone back then,' said Irene, at the time a bright-eyed chef in her 20s. In exchange for daily fresh flowers, for example, the couple would take soup and a sandwich to the florist next door. And for an English painter with a predictable palate, the couple struck a deal: they would get a selection of paintings from him and his friends in exchange for grilled cheese sandwiches. By chance, that deal unwittingly netted them a painting by the acclaimed Canadian folk artist Maud Lewis - a work that nearly five decades later is expected to net more than C$35,000 (US$27,000) when it goes to auction this month. Nearly every day after it first opened, painter John Kinnear and his wife Audrey enjoyed lunch at the Villa, a restaurant run by the Demases in London, Ontario. And each day, the only meal Kinnear would ever order was a grilled cheese sandwich. 'Mind you, it wasn't just an ordinary grilled cheese. It was a great sandwich, with a five-year-old cheddar and beautiful bread,' said Irene. Demas would visit artisan bakeries each morning before the restaurant opened, selecting freshly baked loaves and a 'wonderful cheddar that John just loved'. She'd slather on butter, grilling the slices of whole grain bread until crisp, all for C$2.95. But the repetitive order nonetheless frustrated Demas, who would try to coax her stubborn patron into trying new dishes and daily specials. 'He never budged. He just loved that sandwich.' The first painting the couple received from Kinnear was a watercolour of Jumbo, a famous elephant who was hit and killed by a train in the town of St Thomas, Ontario. One day, Kinnear came in with a selection of new paintings. Demas emerged from the kitchen and saw half a dozen pieces propped up on the tables and chairs of the restaurant. 'I just sat there in silence for quite a while. I'd never ever seen any art like that before. At first I thought they might be playing or some sort of trick on me,' she said of the bright colours and simple content of the works. 'Did a kid do some of these?' Kinnear told the couple of an artist he'd met out in the province of Nova Scotia, a woman who was 'so poor she didn't have the right things to paint on', resorting instead to scraps of wood and the leftover paint fishermen used on their boats. 'He felt sorry for her,' said Demas. Kinnear sent Lewis some boards prepped for painting, a handful of which she returned to him with completed works. Of the selection that day, the only painting that stood out to Demas was one of a black truck. She was pregnant at the time and thought the scene might look nice on her son's wall, where it has remained until now. Lewis, who lived most of her life in poverty, was known for her cheery paintings of life in rural Nova Scotia. She often repeated themes, including cats and ice skaters. 'I put the same things in, I never change,' she told a documentary crew in 1965. She painted nearly every inch of the one-room house she shared with her husband, Everett, including the couple's stove. Lewis's output dropped in the final years of her life as she developed rheumatoid arthritis. She died in 1970 at age 69. In the years since, her fame has grown widely and her works increasingly fetch tens of thousands of dollars. A 2013 biopic has only renewed interest and excitement around the unconventional paintings. 'It's just too bad she didn't live long enough to really reap the benefits of her art,' said Demas. With the encouragement of their children, the couple have decided to put the work up for sale, as well as three pieces of correspondence between Kinnear and Lewis, in which she thanks him for his sustained generosity. 'My husband's 90 and I don't think I have another 50 years to hang on to it,' she said. 'The kids are saying, use the money and travel and just enjoy life.'", "0a5719890b3b734253407620b21cc265521b0df586d96ad0c7e4cea7": "", "9acc183b56cac28ee969728c7dc9776618d138062c267115f5dfda6c": "A University College London scientist has accused lawyers in the US of misusing his groundbreaking work on the brain to justify the dismantling of Roe v Wade, the landmark ruling that legalised abortion nationally in America. Giandomenico Iannetti said his research, which used imaging to understand the adult brain's response to pain, had been wrongly interpreted to make an anti-abortion argument. Last week an unprecedented leak of a draft legal opinion showed a majority of supreme court judges support overturning Roe v Wade and ending federal protections for abortions, in a move that could result in 26 states banning it. The court is considering a case, Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organisation, which challenges Mississippi's ban on abortion after 15 weeks gestation. Anti-abortion lawyers in that case argued that scientific understanding has moved on since the court's 1973 ruling that enshrined the constitutional right to abortion, and it was no longer accurate to say foetuses cannot feel pain before 24 weeks. Their argument relied heavily on a controversial discussion paper on foetal pain published in the Journal of Medical Ethics in 2020 by Dr Stuart Derbyshire, a British associate professor of psychology at the National University of Singapore. The paper claims that some of Iannetti's research results suggest we might not need a cerebral cortex - which remains undeveloped in a foetus of less than 24 weeks - to feel pain. Iannetti, an Italian professor of neuroscience who now leads a laboratory in Italy but spent the past 16 years researching at UCL and Oxford University, is adamant that this is 'an unjustified leap'. 'My results by no means imply that the cortex isn't necessary to feel pain. I feel they were misinterpreted and used in a very clever way to prove a point. It distresses me that my work was misinterpreted and became one of the pillar arguments they [the lawyers] made,' he said. Prof Iannetti had no idea the paper was being used to justify the dismantling of Roe v Wade until American colleagues contacted him to say they were 'shocked' at the way his findings were being presented. He helped academics in the US to draft a response for the lawyers but says he feels it is out of his control and 'there isn't much more I can do to stop people claiming my work says something it doesn't'. Leading pain scientists and academic medical societies on both sides of the Atlantic strongly dispute the anti-abortion legal argument, insisting the international scientific consensus that it is not possible for foetuses to experience pain in the first few weeks of existence remains firm and 'irrefutable'. John Wood, professor of molecular neurobiology at UCL, said: 'I thought this opinion piece [by Derbyshire] was inaccurate.' Wood insisted that 'all serious scientists' agreed a foetus cannot feel pain until 24 weeks, 'and perhaps not even then'. He said lawyers were right to say that science has moved on since 1973, but not in the way they were claiming. 'For instance, we understand a great deal more about pain in newborn babies,' he said. 'Interestingly surgeons who operate on foetuses say that there is movement on surgical intervention from week 36.' Derbyshire told the Observer he is 'firmly pro choice'. He insisted that he had not overstepped in his paper, and claimed that while Iannetti's work had nothing 'directly' to do with foetal pain it had 'unsettled the consensus that the cortex is necessary for pain'. He said: 'I don't honestly see how we can rule out the foetus having some raw experience that is akin to pain. It may be for ever unknowable, and it will not be an equivalent to what you or I experience, but that does not make it nothing.' Prof Vania Apkarian, director of the Centre for Translational Pain Research at the Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, who has spent two decades studying pain in humans and animals, said the evidence on foetal pain had not changed since 1973 and remains 'irrefutable'. 'There is no rational basis for arguing a foetus can suffer pain before 24 weeks. The anatomy of the brain is not formed enough for that to be possible,' he said. 'The foetus is in an essentially sleep-like state in the womb.' Apkarian wrote the scientific briefing for the Jackson Women's Health Organisation case, on behalf of organisations including the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine in the US and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in the UK. He spent months checking all the anti-abortion scientific references in case his side had missed some piece of serious evidence. 'We hadn't,' he said. Apkarian believes science has been roped into a social and religious battle over abortion in order to play on people's emotions. 'The Mississippi case claimed that the foetus, when aborted, is suffering. They claimed that because it is such an emotionally highly laden statement. But it is also totally untrue,' he said. Dr Meera Shah, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood Hudson Peconic, in New York, said: 'The bottom line is that a patient's health, not unproven theories, should drive important medical decisions.'", "de5195f60221d8b493779b77922492b872d6e929519972b3742c4054": "Voters in the Philippines will go to the polls for a presidential election that pits frontrunner Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the son and namesake of the late dictator, against a human rights lawyer who has promised a transparent government. Marcos Jr, known as 'Bongbong', whose authoritarian father plundered billions of dollars from the state and presided over rife human rights abuses, has maintained a strong lead in opinion polls in the run-up to Monday's vote. If elected president, it would mark an extraordinary rehabilitation of one of the country's most controversial political families. Marcos is trailed in the polls by Leni Robredo, the current vice-president and a human rights lawyer who has advocated for marginalised groups. As vice president - a position elected separately from the president - she has frequently clashed with president Rodrigo Duterte, and has condemned his so-called 'war on drugs', which has killed as many as 30,000 people according to some estimates, and prompted an investigation by the international criminal court. Marcos, whose backers have used social media to rebrand the family and whitewash history, has a significant lead in opinion polls. He is the preferred candidate of 56% of voters, according to a recent survey by Pulse Asia. Robredo, behind him, is favoured by 23%. However, analysts say it is possible such surveys have overestimated Marcos's lead, pointing to the large turnouts at Robredo's rallies. 'The reality could be that it is a very close race,' said Ronald Mendoza, the dean of Manila's Ateneo school of government. 'Hopefully [the result] will be settled sooner because that lends itself to a more stable transition.' The Philippine police and military said on Sunday they were on high alert ahead of the vote. 'We are ready for any contingencies,' the armed forces chief, Lt Genl Andres Centino, told a media briefing. 'We are committed ... to ensure that we have a secure, accurate, free and fair elections tomorrow,' he said. On Saturday, the last day of campaigning, Robredo supporters filled the streets of Makati, in the national capital region, with a sea of bright pink, the campaign's trademark colour. 'We have the right to a future with dignity, and we have the duty to fight for it. We have learned that nothing is impossible,' Robredo told crowds of supporters. Robredo is up against two of the country's most powerful political families: the Marcoses, and the Dutertes. The president's daughter, Sara Duterte, is running alongside Marcos Jr for the vice-presidency, though Duterte has not endorsed a presidential candidate. The Marcos camp has shunned TV debates and avoided questions from media outlets it deems unfriendly. Instead, the family and its backers have used social media to reach voters, especially those who do not remember martial law, a time when thousands were killed, tortured and arrested. A network of accounts portray the Marcos period as a time when the country was prosperous and order, inundating news feeds with false claims about the period. Marcos Jr has denied the presence of any coordinated online campaign. Robredo's camp, by contrast, has been driven by volunteer activists who have gone house to house trying to win over undecided voters. It is a strategy that is not usually applied on such a wide scale in presidential elections in the Philippines, and its impact is unclear, say analysts. 'It's something of a puzzle for us political scientists and observers of elections, whether this new thing in this campaign - that voluntarism, the house-to-house campaigns will matter in the final results of the elections,' said Prof Maria Ela L Atienza, who teaches political science at the University of the Philippines. Social media may give the impression that people have a strongly held preference, but this isn't necessarily reflective of society, she added. 'When we look back to previous elections, there was a huge percentage of people in the exit poll saying that they only decided weeks before the election, or even during the actual day of the elections,' she said. People are swayed not by loyalty to a political party, but by other personal factors, including the extent to which they feel a connection with candidates.Marcos, whose slogan is 'together we shall rise again', has campaigned with a message of unity and hope. At his final rally on Saturday, he told supporters: 'We will reach the day that when we join forces, when we again face the world and shout to our friends and wave our flag, we will be proud to say we are Filipinos.' Atienza said the level of engagement among supporters of candidates is comparable to 1986, when Marcos Sr called snap elections - an attempt to prove his mandate amid growing pressure at home and abroad. His claim to have won, amid reports of cheating and fraud, led to the People Power Revolution, which overthrew his rule. It put the Philippines on 'the imperfect road to democracy', said Atienza. The small gains since then could be threatened by the prospect of another Marcos presidency, she added.", "3c060f7cc5f5f7f3f7c05e6b40d8b87907cf21714a83dcab2e8a716e": "The European Union has condemned the appointment of Hong Kong's former security tsar, who oversaw the crackdown on Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, as the Chinese territory's new chief executive with 99% of the vote in a secret ballot on Sunday. Josep Borrell, the bloc's foreign policy chief, said the selection process that led to John Lee being elected is yet 'another step in the dismantling of the 'one country, two systems' principle'. The EU 'calls on Chinese and Hong Kong authorities to abide by their national and international commitments, notably the ultimate aim of electing the chief executive and members of the legislative council by universal suffrage,' Borrell said in a statement shortly after the confirmation of Lee's appointment on Sunday. Lee, 64, was the only candidate in the Beijing-backed race to succeed the outgoing leader, Carrie Lam. Like his predecessor, Lee was among the first Hong Kong and mainland Chinese officials to be put on the US sanctions list for their role in undermining the city's once-guaranteed rights and freedoms. Last month, his YouTube channel was blocked by Google to comply with the sanctions. Analysts say his elevation signals that Beijing's tough policy on Hong Kong is set to continue. It is also the first time that a former security official has been appointed to the top job in one of Asia's most significant business hubs. Hong Kong became the attention of the world's media in 2019 for its months-long street protests, the biggest since its handover to China from Britain in 1997. Beijing imposed a controversial national security legislation in the city the following year, which bars secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces. The Hong Kong administration's debilitating pandemic controls have invited complaints from both residents and foreign businesses in recent months. Several foreign chambers of commerce warned the city of the damage of the zero-Covid policy. Lee's new position was confirmed after being chosen by an 'election committee' made up of 1,461 people, roughly 0.02% of the city's 7.4 million population. Critics say the committee does not represent the wide range of views in Hong Kong, and that its members are mostly pro-Beijing. After a brief secret ballot on Sunday, 99% or 1,416 members voted for Lee while eight voted against, according to officials. Beijing hailed the near-unanimous result, saying it showed that 'Hong Kong society has a high level of recognition and approval' for Lee. 'This is a real demonstration of democratic spirit,' the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office said in a statement. Under the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, Beijing is remoulding Hong Kong in its own authoritarian image after huge and sometimes violent democracy protests three years ago. Dissenting voices have almost disappeared after last year's electoral changes that allowed only 'patriots' to take part in legislature polls. Street protests have been largely outlawed, and authorities have used an anti-Covid ban on public gatherings of more than four people as well as the security law to do so. Despite the risks, the League of Social Democrats - one of the only remaining pro-democracy groups - held a three-person protest before the polls opened Sunday, chanting: 'Power to the people, universal suffrage now.' 'This is what John Lee's new chapter looks like - a shrinking of our civil liberties,' said protester Vanessa Chan as dozens of police officers looked on. 'We know this action will have no effect, but we don't want Hong Kong to be completely silent.' Hong Kong's chief executives have found themselves caught between the democratic aspirations of the city's residents and the authoritarian demands of Beijing's leaders for years, and Lam is on track to leave office with record-low approval ratings. Lee's challenge in governing the once-freewheeling society is not merely political. Hong Kong also faces economic difficulties thanks to two years of strict pandemic curbs that have damaged its reputation as a business hub and left residents cut off as rivals reopen. Under the slogan 'Starting a new chapter for Hong Kong together', Lee has vowed to bring in 'results-oriented' governance, forge unity and reboot the city's economy. A 44-page manifesto he released last week stuck to broad goals and offered few concrete policies or targets. He has said he will unveil more details when he makes his first policy address. According to a survey in March by the Public Opinion Research Institute, about 24% of the public has confidence in Lee, compared with 12% for Lam. Queuing outside a restaurant on Sunday, Alex Tam, 25, said he and his friends were paying little attention to proceedings. 'It's just an empty gesture,' he said. 'If he didn't listen to the protesters, I don't see how he would listen to young people now, especially those who criticise the government.' Yeung wing-shun, a retired businessman, was more positive, saying he hoped Lee would guide Hong Kong with a firm hand and that he believed the new leader could bring different sectors together. Lee will take office on 1 July, the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's handover to China from Britain. China agreed at the time that Hong Kong could maintain certain freedoms and autonomy for 50 years after retaking control from Britain under a 'one country, two systems' formula. Beijing and Lee insist the formula is still intact. Critics, including many western powers, say it has been shredded.", "f342311bb309bbbac68051cb3bee3fdaababe31ed3d24f68deb0ece8": "Despite everything that has happened to her country since the Taliban seized power last August, 29-year old Nafisa still never believed there would come a day when she would be unable to feel the sun on her face as she walked the streets of Kabul. Yet on Saturday, the Taliban's sinisterly named ministry for the propagation of virtue ordered that Nafisa, along with millions of women across Afghanistan, should ideally not leave the house at all. If they do, they must be fully veiled and never show their faces in public. 'The Taliban has no plans for Afghanistan other than imposing restrictions on women,' says Nafisa, who says she rejects the Taliban's latest attempts to push Afghan women into the shadows. 'I do not accept the obligatory hijab and I will never wear a burqa.' The restrictions require women to either wear a burqa, the head-to-toe covering that allows women to see through only a small grille at eye-level or a full niqab, which covers the face but not the eyes. Most Afghan women already wear some form of hijab, but many in cities such as Kabul previously covered only their hair. Along with the decree, the Taliban issued a detailed set of restrictions and punishments that leave women's family members responsible for their compliance and facing fines and jail if they are seen in public uncovered. If women working for the government go out without their face veiled they will be fired and Taliban fighters will also lose their jobs if their female relatives fail to obey the new restrictions. For many women in Kabul, the decree comes on the back of a campaign of harassment and violence at the hands of the Taliban and their street enforcers that has been mounting in recent months. Young women in the capital who before last summer had never lived under Taliban rule say the religious police force has been emboldened, roaming the streets of the city looking for excuses to question, intimidate and beat women for wearing colourful clothes, jeans or travelling without a male companion. Nazanin, a public university student, was beaten by the Taliban for sitting in the front seat of a taxi about two weeks ago in Kabul. 'They lashed me two times across my back. It felt like my bones were broken.' Nazanin said after she was beaten, the taxi driver was arrested and taken to the police station. Shabnam, 23, who lives in Kabul, says she does not feel safe walking in the streets any more. Three weeks ago Taliban fighters stopped her 12-year old cousin, held her down and cut her hair in public because it was not fully covered by a scarf. Shortly after, her cousin and her family fled the country. 'The Taliban have taken away my very basic right, which is the right to choose my own clothes, and this is very painful for me,' she says. At the beginning of the year, the Taliban arrested several women who protested against the forced hijab and held them in an unknown location until they were forced to release them following international outrage.The latest restrictions are part a concerted campaign to roll back decades of advances in women's rights across the country. When it seized power in August 2021, the Taliban claimed they had changed and would respect women's right to a public life but since then have taken away the right of women to travel alone, to work outside healthcare and to education. The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) condemned the face veil decree as the latest attack on women's rights but said it believed it would become strictly enforced despite widespread international condemnation. 'Information that UNAMA has received suggests this is a formal directive rather than a recommendation, and that it will be implemented and enforced,' it said.

A counter-offensive against Russia also appeared to be gathering pace in the north, where analysts said that Ukraine's military may be able to push Russian forces out of artillery range of the country's second city of Kharkiv in the coming days. However, there were fears that dozens of people have been killed in the shelling of a school in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine, where Russia has been concentrating its military push in recent days. At least two people have been confirmed dead after Russian bombs hit the school in the Ukrainian village of Bilohorivka, Serhiy Gaidai, governor of the Luhansk region, said on Sunday. Gaidai said Russia dropped a bomb on Saturday afternoon on the school where about 90 people were sheltering, causing a fire that engulfed the building. Thirty people have been rescued but he said 60 people remained under the rubble The Ukrainian claim to have destroyed another Russian ship - after the sinking of the warship Moskva in the Black Sea last month - was accompanied by footage showing what was said to have been a strike by a Bayraktar drone on a vessel docked at Snake Island. 'The traditional parade of the Russian Black Sea fleet on 9 May this year will be held near Snake Island - at the bottom of the sea,' tweeted Ukraine's Ministry of Defence. Satellite photos analysed by the Associated Press show the aftermath of an apparent Ukrainian drone strike on Friday on Russian positions on Snake Island, with thick black smoke rising overhead. Images showed what appeared to be a Russian Serna-class landing craft at Snake Island's northern beach. They corresponded to another Ukrainian military video released showing a drone strike hitting it and engulfing the vessel in flames. Elsewhere, a Ukrainian deputy prime minister said all women, children and elderly people had been evacuated from the besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol. Ukraine had said 50 civilians were evacuated on Friday, but accused Russia of violating a ceasefire intended to allow dozens more still trapped at the plant to leave. The final evacuees followed about 500 others who were allowed to leave the plant and other parts of the city in recent days. Russia's defence ministry confirmed the completion of an operation to evacuate civilians from the plant. In an online posting, the ministry said a total of 51 people had been rescued since the three-day operation started on Thursday, including one person on Saturday. The 51 comprised 18 men, 22 women and 11 children, it added. In Moscow, Russia's most senior lawmaker accused the US of coordinating military operations in Ukraine, which he said amounted to direct US involvement in military action against Russia. 'Washington is essentially coordinating and developing military operations, thereby directly participating in military actions against our country,' Vyacheslav Volodin wrote on his Telegram channel. Washington and European members of the transatlantic Nato alliance have supplied Kyiv with heavy weapons to help it resist a Russian offensive that has resulted in the occupation of parts of eastern and southern Ukraine but failed to take Kyiv. However, the US and its Nato allies have repeatedly said they will not take part in fighting themselves, in order to avoid becoming parties to the conflict. The conflict in Ukraine is taking a 'heavy toll' on some of Russia's most capable units, the UK's Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence report. At least one T-90M, Russia's most advanced tank, has been destroyed in fighting, the ministry added. 'It will take considerable time and expense for Russia to reconstitute its armed forces following this conflict,' the report said. A Washington-based thinktank, the Institute for the Study of War, also said in its most recent assessment that Ukraine's military may be able to push Russian forces 'out of artillery range of Kharkiv in the coming days', providing a respite for the city and an opportunity to build the defenders' momentum 'into a successful, broader counteroffensive'. Meanwhile, several missiles hit Odesa earlier on Saturday, according to a Ukrainian local government spokesperson, after targets in the surrounding region had been hit by four missiles earlier. The strikes outside the city were from four Russian cruise missiles fired from aircraft, according to Natalia Humeniuk, the spokesperson for the Ukrainian military's southern operational command. She added that the strike targeted the city of Arcyz and no one was injured. The World Health Organization told Ukrainians in Kyiv on Saturday that the WHO stood by them in their conflict with Russia, and urged Moscow to stop waging war on its neighbour. The director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said: 'My message to all the people of Ukraine is this, WHO stands by you.' The WHO emergencies director, Mike Ryan, told the same news conference at the government media centre in Kyiv that the WHO had already documented 200 attacks on healthcare facilities in Ukraine, and would pass its findings on to those who could assess whether crimes had been committed.", "af79f329c9903563e6de9ac12f111d9773da82b8885babe99d4d92a1": "", "df6624983e0602fce7b2cc9899fcf000408d64b2942bbc9ee8f53bc3": "The government is scrambling to rehouse hundreds of Ukrainians granted visas under the Homes for Ukraine scheme because the people they were supposed to stay with have been deemed 'unsuitable', the Observer can reveal. Refugee charities have warned since the scheme's launch that with most of the refugees being women and children, and many matches made on social media websites such as Facebook, the scheme risked being targeted by predatory men. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC), which runs the scheme, has insisted that no visa is issued until the Home Office has completed checks on every adult in a sponsor household. However, a source with links to the DLUHC told the Observer that the department is 'looking for bridging accommodation for a group of 600 refugees who have come to the UK, but the people they have come to stay with have been found to be unsuitable'. This included sponsors with a criminal record. The refugees have been placed in hotels as an emergency option, the source said, but ministers are looking for better options, including university student accommodation, until they are matched with new families. A second source, who also spoke to the Observer on condition of anonymity, said: 'These 600 Ukrainian refugees had been granted visas, but their sponsors were found to be unsuitable either because they had a criminal record or for some other reason.' Robina Qureshi, director of Positive Action in Housing, a charity that set up the UK's first refugee hosting programme and is matching 1,000 Ukrainians with families across the UK, said it was no surprise that the government's scheme had 'unravelled so quickly'. 'It's a free-for-all matching system,' she said. 'We don't agree with social media as a tool for meeting vulnerable people like this.' Qureshi is concerned that a predatory single man who is only interested in hosting a young, single Ukrainian woman would not be caught out by DBS checks. She said: 'Refugees have been led along by people saying they are registered for Homes for Ukraine, which sounds like some official guarantee when that isn't the case.' Yvonne Kachikoti, head of resettlement and integration services at charity Refugee Action, said: 'The government's reckless and unregulated approach to matching has put vulnerable refugees at considerable risk of ending up in the homes of people planning to exploit them.' She added: 'Already traumatised families forced to leave their Homes for Ukraine host after a nasty experience are unlikely to want to be rematched with another sponsor.' The Local Government Association says it has been flagging up the 'inevitability' of some unsuitable accommodation being offered since the start of the Homes for Ukraine scheme. Its chair, councillor James Jamieson, said: 'We are asking the government to give us information on sponsors prior to matching, so we can get ahead of the game in making checks.' He said councils had been getting more advance information in the past 10 days, but it was 'still far short of what we would like'. He stressed that the Home Office was responsible for checking if hosts have criminal records before a visa is granted. He added: 'There is no check on accommodation before that, no local police check, and no local knowledge applied to people.' A government spokesperson said: 'Homes for Ukraine has stringent safeguarding measures, and they are working. All potential sponsors and adults living in the household are subject to security checks, including criminal records, before visas are approved to allow applicants to travel to the UK. Councils also conduct further checks on the sponsor and their household as quickly as possible once a visa application has been submitted. 'Local authorities will provide emergency accommodation to Ukrainians if necessary. This has not been required for the overwhelming majority of the 19,500 people who have arrived under the scheme so far.' As yet there is no system in place for universities to sponsor Ukrainian refugees. However, Universities UK, the vice-chancellors' group, said 20 universities have expressed interest. Prof David Green, vice-chancellor of Worcester University, said: 'We registered our accommodation on the Homes for Ukraine website in March. Sadly, we have no refugees with us, which is so frustrating. We remain extremely keen to do this and rooms could be made available immediately.' He said with many of the refugees being women and children, it was important they could offer 24-7 security, including police community support officers embedded at the university, as well as cooking and social facilities. He added: 'We want to make every contribution, however small, to help those who have been made into refugees by this cruel, illegal invasion, as well as to those who are bravely remaining to fight.'", "0a6763ffe8b67f7043ac790214af542ce57a3df1a2be816cbcfe82e0": "'Holding up', wrote Denys Prokopenko, commander of Ukraine's Azov regiment, in his latest WhatsApp message to his wife Kateryna from the besieged Azovstal steelworks in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. Speaking via Zoom from Krakow, in eastern Poland, alongside three fellow wives and partners of soldiers living under the remorseless Russian shelling and infiltrating raids, Kateryna, 27, says she is doing everything she can think of to ensure the message at 10pm on Friday evening is not one of her husband's last. It is now two weeks since the last Ukrainian defenders of the flattened city of Mariupol, in south-east Ukraine, withdrew to the sprawling complex of hot and fetid tunnels, along with thousands of terrified civilians, including children. Attempts to evacuate the non-combatants brokered by the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) have been successful, with a further 50 people reportedly taken out on Saturday. Last night Ukraine's deputy prime minister, Iryna Veheshchuk, said all women, children and older adults had been evacuated. For the 2,000 soldiers, 700 of whom are said to be injured, hope, however, is quickly dwindling, as has become cruelly clear from the irregular messages coming out of the works. 'The last message was yesterday,' Kateryna says of the text from her 30-year-old husband. I said 'Hold up, we will do everything in our power to save you.'' Russian barrages on strategic targets in the east and south of Ukraine have been intensifying in the lead-up to a historically significant day that has put many on edge, with several missiles striking the port city of Odesa on Saturday. The streets of Mariupol are also being cleared of debris before an expected 9 May Victory Day parade to mark the defeat of Nazi Germany by the Soviet Union - and the wiping out of the final redoubt of Ukrainian defenders of the devastated city. Kateryna, with the other military wives, is appealing for an internationally supervised extraction of the last of the soldiers suffering and dying in the steelworks. They won't surrender, she says, as there is no chance of humane treatment. But she insists that the international community has a duty to prevent a massacre. 'The conditions are awful, there is a complete blockade, they can't deliver water, food or anything else,' Kateryna says. 'They are sharing their supplies with the civilians that are also there. They can't get any medical help. 'Dead people are also there, because it's important for our soldiers to save the bodies of their mates,' she says. 'Refrigerators are barely working. So the conditions are awful. The bunkers are covered with mould, there are a few days left, they might just die from hunger. 'We are inspired by the Dunkirk evacuation. We just need some brave countries that will evacuate our soldiers and civilians by sea or by air. But we need some brave countries to give Russia an ultimatum.' Yulia Fedosiuk, 29, whose husband Arseniy, 29, is a sergeant in the Azov regiment, says she received her last message via Telegram at the same time as Kateryna on Friday evening. 'The way things are going, they have only five days left,' she says. 'He also told me there are two wounded soldiers that may die in 24 hours. They have damaged organs, gangrene that has been getting worse for two months. There is no medication. Some of them have sepsis, necrosis and have lost a lot of blood.' The Azov regiment, which has in the past had nationalist far-right affiliations, was a militia formed to fight the Russians after the invasion of Ukraine in 2014 but has become a unit of the Ukrainian national guard. Yulia, an assistant to a Ukrainian politician, said the mother of one Azov soldier had received an image of her dead son from the Russians. 'We don't want our soldiers to become war prisoners, because there is a lot of propaganda around Azov,' she says. 'Azov is a red rag for Russians, they hate them. If you are from Azov, there is no chance you will come back healthy or alive ... We think our government can take more political and diplomatic steps. They can talk about it more.' Anna Naumenko, 25, a projects manager, received some voice messages from her husband Dmytro Danilov, 29, at 1am on Saturday that she said were difficult to hear. 'He told me it was very hot there,' she says. 'There are no painkillers for people with torn limbs. There are very little antibiotics, and most of them are used for operations only. 'He also told me about a three-year-old girl who lives at Azovstal. She lost her parents, and there are a lot of children like that in the bunkers. She is running around, and pinching the soldiers, saying 'painkiller.'' The women say they believe the British government could rally an international effort. They are seeking to travel to the UK to campaign but are as yet unable to get the visas, as many Ukrainians have found, with the Home Office website warning of a six-week wait. 'My partner is a bit pessimistic, because they were promised help and nothing is happening,' says Olha Andrianova, 31, the owner of a chain of kindergartens, of Serghii, 26, a sergeant in the Azov regiment. 'I am trying to cheer him up and ask him not to lose hope.'", "554cac89782b7ba9d8d348ec1db40d736cbb211501eaacd7e60f6647": "On the brink of its May 9 Victory Day celebrations, Russia looks very far from triumph in its war in Ukraine. And all of its options going forward are fraught with danger. After a disastrous assault on Kyiv, Russia is engaged in an attempt to take territory in Ukraine's east, as its military nears exhaustion and sanctions continue to escalate. 'With the current force that they have, the push that they're attempting now is all that they have left,' said Jeffrey Edmonds, former director for Russia on the US national security council and senior analyst at the CNA thinktank. 'Militaries just don't recover that quickly from such a devastating loss. And given how effective the Ukrainians have been with our support, I just don't think they're going to be able to achieve their objectives within the coming weeks. And the coming weeks are going to be the telltale of where this is going.' Facing setbacks, officials have suggested that Vladimir Putin may use the May 9 holiday to repackage the war in Ukraine. Dramatic options include escalation through a formal declaration of war or general mobilisation - or de-escalating by proclaiming victory. Alternatively, Putin could offer up a 'sandwich', as one analyst put it, that praises the Russian army's 'victory' while preparing the population for a grinding and painful conflict as status quo. Ukrainian officials in particular have warned that Putin is planning to announce a mass mobilisation, or even to declare war against Ukraine, calling up personnel and resources that were untapped under Russia's so-called 'special operation' that began on 24 February. 'Russia has already moved to covert mobilisation and is preparing to announce open mobilisation in the near future,' said Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine's military intelligence, in an interview this week with the Ukrainian news outlet New Times. 'I'm quite curious: how will they explain this to their own people?' The Kremlin has denied it is planning a mobilisation, although some Russians have leaked call-up papers and state orders relating to a potential mobilisation online. A number of enlistment offices have been targeted in arson attacks since March, including one in remote Nizhnevartovsk last week as rumours of a coming mobilisation grew. But a formal mobilisation, which could see tens of thousands of reservists pulled from their jobs, and borders closed to fighting-age men, is something that Russia has never managed before. It would be highly disruptive to the economy and would further raise the stakes in a war where Russia has already disappointed on the battlefield. 'Proclaiming mobilisation will make this war highly unpopular,' said Pavel Luzin, a Russian military expert. He also questioned whether it would be 'technically possible' - 'What can you do with the mobilised people? Which officers and military units can deal with them?' 'This is no magic pill for them, it's not a get-out-of-jail free card for Putin,' Edmonds said, noting that by the time new troops were brought up, the 'Russians could be falling apart'. Fearing defeat, Russia may threaten to raise the stakes even further. Top propagandist Dmitry Kiselyov showed a simulation of a nuclear strike against the UK on national television this week. 'Just one launch, Boris, and England is gone,' he said. 'Once and for all. Why play with us?' Putin may also hint at the potential for nuclear conflict as he stands before the heavy weaponry, including intercontinental ballistic missiles, that he returned to the Red Square parade in 2008. 'He also knows that we're going to be listening to him, so I wouldn't be surprised if there's some nuclear rhetoric in there as well,' said the CNA's Edmonds. He said he remained sceptical that Russia could use a tactical nuclear weapon in the conflict, but like others noted that the Kremlin has become more unpredictable. 'If Putin sees this as becoming existential, then all bets are off the table.' Seeing the limited potential for victory, Putin could also seek to de-escalate the conflict. Standing before his military and the country on Monday, Putin could announce that Russia has achieved its major war aims in Ukraine by allegedly destroying Ukrainian military capacity, and by taking near control of several mid-sized cities such as Mariupol and Kherson. But that may also be a tough sell, as the Ukrainian military could try to retake lost ground, leading to further losses even if Russia stakes a defensive position. A senior Russian official last week in Kherson said that Russia had returned 'forever,' making the idea of a political settlement that would return control of its territory to Ukraine even more remote. And as Ben Noble, an associate professor of Russian politics at University College London, noted, the Kremlin's vague and changing war aims have meant that many people in Russia may be left unsatisfied with whatever Putin eventually claims as victory. 'That's probably the strongest reason why many people say that the Kremlin is in a corner now, that they're stuck, because they're inevitably going to disappoint some groups with whatever they claim as a victory in the broader term,' he said. Expectations of a big announcement on 9 May, he said, may speak more to the frustration among those outside the Kremlin than to the fact that anything meaningful will be announced. 'They want a sense of certainty, they want a new chapter in this conflict,' he said. While the Kremlin may feel political and economic pressure to end the war, a grinding conflict may be better than admitting defeat. 'I assume he will use the 9th of May to somehow address the victory ... something a lot of sociologists tell us is that Russians want this to be over but in a good way,' said Anton Barbashin, the editorial director at Riddle Russia and a political analyst. 'But I would expect that he also needs to introduce some new challenges as well. It needs to be a sandwich, it can't be just victory. There is so much going on, and by now Putin is aware of the economic risks and problems that are going to arise quite soon. So you probably need to propose a strong vision of how Russia is challenged.' That is already visible in state media reports that explain Russia is at war with Nato rather than just with Ukraine in order to justify some of the military's recent defeats. The Kremlin is also facing an urgent ideological challenge, Barbashin noted, as the war increasingly begins to affect ordinary Russians who may not have a clear idea of why Russia decided that it would invade Ukraine in the first place. 'The more I think of it, the more astonishing it is that this war has shown that Russia has no ideology whatsoever,' he said. 'They're trying to come up with something new but none of it actually makes sense. Russians do not understand what the hell Russia is doing there.' While Russia's main military parade will be held on Red Square on 9 May, for millions of Russians, Victory Day is a spectacle that will play out on state television. The national holiday is spent with the TV on in many households, where the parade is bookended by news broadcasts and, usually, by Soviet war films and Russian blockbusters about the second world war. But this year may be different. The parade, which begins at 10am with a review of the troops and a speech by Putin, is among the most-watched programmes of the entire year in Russia. State-affiliated pollsters estimate that more than half of households watch it, although those numbers could be inflated. While rumours have swirled about a major announcement by Putin of a military mobilisation or a 'mission accomplished' message, he usually dedicates the speech to familiar lines about the 'spectre of fascism' and a recognition of veterans of what Russia calls the Great Patriotic War.", "f26d287c1034ab2aaf312c5afd8d18c2b9ccdaa7b0f9f2a830394a32": "The call came around midnight. There was a suspicious man poking around a rundown complex of garages and workshops, police had heard a gunshot and so they wanted backup. The men of the Maidan group rolled out of the bodyshop that served as their headquarters, into a couple of vans with personalised Maidan numberplates and their own ambulance, and set off into the eerie quiet of curfew-hours Kyiv. The alarms this late were usually just for drunks so steeped in booze they had lost track of time and forgotten to go home, said 'Sheriff', who asked to go by his call sign. But the ad hoc group of paramilitaries, who work closely with a police force diminished by war - on call for the local stations and monitoring their radios - are always prepared for something more violent. Far from the frontlines, the war is straining society. There has been extraordinary solidarity across Ukraine, with ordinary people risking, and often giving, their lives to help others simply make it through the day, taking food and fuel to vulnerable and elderly people, or driving evacuation vehicles to pick up those stranded at the frontline. But a minority have taken advantage of the chaos of fighting, the flight of many neighbours into exile, and authorities distracted by an existential threat. There is constant fear of Russian agents, even far beyond the frontline. Security forces say they have arrested more than 4,000 'collaborators' and 140 people planning military sabotage since the war began. And cities are awash with guns, after the government started handing them out to almost anyone who promised to fight, during the early days of the war. 'In Kyiv we are mostly seeing solidarity, but the dark side is more visible, too, now. When you have everyone cohesive, the little that is not sticks out,' Sheriff said. In over two months since the first missiles hit Kyiv, Maidan patrols have picked up opportunists on looting raids, desperate residents driven to steal as the economy collapsed, and Russian spies trying to scope potential targets, gather information or just prepare for orders to come. 'We have to defend the whole country, the guys at the frontlines are the professionals, and we keep their backs,' said Sheriff, who said he tried to sign up for the military after the first bombs fell, but like many in the city was turned away from overwhelmed recruitment offices. 'We want local people to see we are here, so there isn't panic.' Four days earlier, they had picked up a Russian security service (FSB) agent using a fake Ukrainian passport, he said, because the man was acting like a bad spy from a B-list film, driving around slowly, taking photos of sensitive sites and then calling numbers in Russia. In a country filled with rumours and paranoia about saboteurs, it sounded like just another tall tale. But he flipped open his photo roll to show pictures of the man's arrest, his fake Ukrainian passport, stamps in a concealed Russian passport showing multiple entries to parts of Ukraine controlled by Moscow-backed separatists, and even a picture of an FSB ID card, stored on the man's phone. 'At first I was sad they didn't take me for the frontline but then I realised. It takes six months training in boot camp to fight, but it takes 18 years training to know how to catch insurgents,' said Sheriff, who spent nearly two decades in the police, finishing up as a colonel in the division fighting organised crime. 'It gives you a feeling for people (acting suspiciously),' he added. People they catch, like the Russian agent, often underestimate the group because they aren't in uniform. 'He tried to threaten me that I was the criminal for stopping him. He thought I was just the usual territorial defence who just picked up a weapon. But I was in the police before, so I can eat him for breakfast (when it comes to the law).' The group was formed after the 2014 protests that ousted a pro-Russian president when he suspended plans to sign an association agreement with the European Union. They have been practising since then for a war that others never thought would come. 'Everyone laughed at us 'what the fuck are you doing, there isn't going to be a war'.' They have their own telegram group with 20,000 subscribers so residents of their neighbourhood can reach out directly when they can't get through to authorities. Some policemen from the area fled with their families in the first days of the war, and have not come back, the group said, making it harder to enforce order. And the new demographics of this largely working-class neighbourhood in eastern Kyiv, across the Dnieper River, have also made crime more of a risk. 'Many of the people who left (when the war started) were people with money to get away, and the ability to manage. The people who stayed are the poorest, those with no work.' They include addicts and alcoholics, like the man found stumbling around the garages. He was obviously inebriated, and claimed his home was nearby and he had been drinking for hours and simply missed the curfew. The men called up a local, who confirmed the man's wife would be waiting with a fury that would probably be more of a deterrent than any formal punishment, and sent him on his way. Sheriff's second-in-command goes by 'Kypish', a word for intense action or combat, because he enjoys being part of the action.  'My job is guarding a big shop because in the first day (of the war) it was all looted. It has electronic and construction materials,' he says. The problem is not restricted to the big city. Elsewhere, including the suburban town of Irpin, badly shelled then occupied by Russians and now infamous for atrocities, the invading troops were mocked for a rampage of theft. But in their wake, some Ukrainians took advantage of the abandoned houses. 'At the beginning we were catching 10 a day, now they are very few in number. They are all local, now they are waiting for trial,' said policeman Andrei Suhdolsky. Cars that have been recovered are kept at the police station for owners to collect; for other items it can be hard to prove ownership. However, no one is under suspicion for taking food, he added, because during the occupation people were starving. Back in the empty streets of night-time Kyiv, where the curfew runs from 10pm to 5am, there are also teenagers who don't want to be stuck at home, and some people who simply don't care about the rules and wander out after curfew for fresh air. 'There was a guy out, he said he wanted a walk. We made him do press-ups. One guy is maybe just a mistake, but if there are a lot of them, you have a problem. People here think curfew is just a joke the government made up.' After getting coffee at one of the few petrol stations that stays open all night for emergency workers, and wondering aloud why they hadn't had more call outs, they ran into a problem that has been growing since February - hedgehogs. Not the anti-tank defences set up to stop invading forces, but the small prickly animals. They have taken advantage of the suddenly empty streets to roam more widely than they used to, forcing the animal-loving patrol car drivers to swerve wildly or slam on the brakes, if they want to avoid squashing the little curfew breakers.", "8c84b5ba39d1f4dfda071683cc4fc06e4e3dde44d01f12fc9cc55b8f": "Late last month saw the release of Trevor Reed, a US citizen and former marine who had been detained in Russia since 2019 on a nine-year sentence for endangering the 'life and health' of Russian police officers. Now, Reed's release has increased pressure on the Biden administration to act decisively on the number of other American hostages being held around the world, often for years, without apparent progress toward their return home. One of those is 40-year-old Austin Tice, a former marine and freelance journalist for multiple media outlets, including the Washington Post, who was detained in Syria in 2012. Last week, Tice's parents, Debra and Marc, met with Biden at the White House, two days after Tice's mother, Debra, attended the White House Correspondents' Association dinner. She says she was caught off guard when Biden said at the dinner that he would 'like to meet you and Dad to talk about your son'. The Tices have said they believe that the president's personal involvement will signal to Syria that the US government views their son's freedom as a diplomatic priority. 'Knowing that Biden supports the efforts and wants the same things we want gives them license to pursue these things without worrying about repercussions or making a misstep,' Marc Tice told Axios. But the US maintains an official policy of non-engagement with the Assad regime, and Damascus has 'repeatedly made clear' that they will not negotiate on Tice's case with mediators. That's left the Tice's wondering how the administration plans to act on their son's behalf. 'I left the meeting thinking those were hugely uplifting words. I can hardly wait to see some action,' Debra Tice said. But she cautioned: 'We've had lots and lots of words in the past nine years and almost nine months. We need action.' Tice is a marine veteran who had traveled to Syria in May 2012 to report on the civil war's impact on the Syrian people. On his way out of the country three months later he was detained at a checkpoint in the southern Damascus suburb of Darayya. Five weeks later a 43-second video titled 'Austin Tice is Alive' was posted online showing him blindfolded and held by armed men. Six years later, in November 2018, the then special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, Robert O'Brien, said that US officials believed Tice was alive. He did not provide details. During a March 2020 press briefing, President Donald Trump called on the Assad regime to release him. 'We have one young gentleman, Austin Tice, and we're working very hard with Syria to get him out,' the president said. 'We hope the Syrian government will do that. We are counting on them to do that. 'So, Syria, please work with us. And we would appreciate you letting him out,' Trump added. The Tice family are now hoping that Reed's release in a prisoner swap for Konstantin Yaroshenko, a convicted Russian drug trafficker serving time in Connecticut, marks another rare moment of diplomatic energy around an issue that has largely been obscured under a crush of foreign and domestic political priorities by the last three successive presidents. On Wednesday, Elizabeth Whelan, whose brother Paul is imprisoned in Russia serving a 16-year sentence on espionage-related charges, joined a rally outside the White House to press for greater official engagement on the issue. 'This is not something a normal family, just an everyday family, has to ever deal with. It is horrific.' Whelan later said. She expressed disappointment that US diplomats had not secured Whelan's release alongside Reed. 'The fact that they couldn't get them both out at the same time has re-energized that effort, and I hope it brings back the attention to all of these cases.' The US government says that at least 55 American or legal permanent residents are being wrongfully detained or held hostage in countries including Venezuela, Iran, Afghanistan and Rwanda, according to the advocacy group Bring Our Families Home. The group gathered outside the White House on Wednesday to plead for the Biden administration's attention. Some at the rally said they had repeatedly tried to get a meeting with President Biden to discuss their family's case. 'You have to go to the president, the one who's going to have to make the tough decisions to solve these particular cases,' Whelan said. 'Either that, or there needs to be a better approach to wrongful detention so that we're not constantly knocking on his door.' Everett Rutherford, whose nephew, Matthew Heath, is jailed in Venezuela on terrorism charges, said the issue of American captives demands 'action from the man who occupies the house behind me'. In nearly all cases, the captives are being held by governments that view Washington as an adversary. Administration officials say the release of Americans wrongfully detained abroad is foreign policy priority. 'We are doing everything we can, almost all of it unseen, almost all of it unsaid in public, to do everything we can to advance the commitment that President Biden has to see these Americans who are wrongfully or unjustly detained around the world or in some cases held hostage around the world brought home,' state department spokesperson, Ned Price, said at a press briefing. The most recent of those classified as 'wrongfully detained' is Brittney Griner, the star center for the Phoenix Mercury, arrested in February at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport after a search of her luggage produced vape cartridges containing oil derived from cannabis. The special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, Roger Carstens, 'will go anywhere, he will talk to anyone if it means that we're able to come home with an American, to reunite that American with her or his family', Price said last week. Bill Richardson, the former New Mexico governor who has long been involved in efforts to free Americans imprisoned overseas, including in North Korea, is reportedly also involved in the effort to secure Griner's release. Richardson could not be reached for comment. Robert Saale, a former director of the Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell, an intra-agency operation comprising hostage recovery experts from across government that works out of FBI headquarters in Virginia, told the Military Times last year that Syria's complex dynamics had worked against Tice's release. 'It's almost like a perfect storm of circumstances, sort of inopportune times, where you've had chemical strikes by Syrians, followed by retaliatory strikes by the US government. It's kind of a two steps forward, three steps back process,' he said. Last week the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said the president's national security team would henceforth remain 'in regular contact with the Tices and other families of Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad. 'We appreciate the bravery and candor of families enduring these harrowing experiences, and we remain committed to supporting them and, most importantly, reuniting them with their loved ones,' Psaki continued. Last summer, the Tices said they had grown increasingly frustrated with efforts to secure their son's freedom. 'We are also intensely frustrated by the irresolute, on-again-off-again involvement of our government and its insufficient resolve to secure Austin's release,' according to a statement. But following their meeting with Biden last week, the family expressed renewed optimism. 'Trevor walking free means Austin can walk free,' Debra Tice said. 'Because all of the things that I've been told that cannot be done obviously can be done. And now, I expect that they will be done.'", "e7f376e093716688a06c1c887bfd2f2544f219ab2a3495696aee52cd": "Northern Ireland has slipped into political crisis after Sinn Fein's triumph in the assembly election triggered calls for a referendum on a united Ireland and the Democratic Unionist party vowed to block the formation of a new power-sharing executive at Stormont. Jubilant Sinn Fein supporters celebrated across the region on Saturday when final vote counts confirmed a historic victory that turned the former IRA mouthpiece into the biggest party, with the right to nominate the first minister. Sinn Fein won 29% of the first preference vote and will be the biggest party in the Stormont assembly, a seismic moment for a state that was designed a century ago to have a permanent unionist majority. The party once led by Gerry Adams seeks to abolish what it considers an illegitimate entity and shuns the term Northern Ireland, instead referring to 'the North', presenting an existential challenge to the UK. Sinn Fein's MPs boycott Westminster. In a coded reference to Irish unification, Michelle O'Neill, the party's deputy president, and the first minister elect, said: 'It's a defining moment for our politics and for our people. Today ushers in a new era which I believe presents us all with an opportunity to reimagine relationships in this society on the basis of fairness, on the basis of equality, and on the basis of social justice, irrespective of religious or social backgrounds.' It was time for Ireland north and south to discuss a new, shared island, she said. 'Let's have a healthy debate about what our future looks like.' Sinn Fein's leader, Mary Lou McDonald, had a message for unionists: 'Don't be scared. The future is bright for all of us.' She added there was a collective responsibility to get the government 'up and running quickly'. 'This is not a time for theatrics, this is not a time for playing games, this is the time for grown-up sensible partnership politics, that's what people want,' she said. 'The idea, at a time of a cost of living crisis, that people would stand on the sidelines and allow people to struggle, and struggle badly, for us is unthinkable, so we would appeal to everybody to take stock.' Sinn Fein has been in power at Stormont with other parties for 15 years and has promised to make the region work - but it sent a stark message to Boris Johnson's government that a referendum on a united Ireland was now on the agenda. The party's soaring popularity in the Republic of Ireland, where it leads the opposition in the Dublin parliament, will add to No 10's alarm. Under the Good Friday agreement, the secretary of state for Northern Ireland is supposed to call a referendum if it appears likely a majority wants a united Ireland. Polls show most people favour staying within the UK but Sinn Fein hopes to change the tide within five to 10 years. The Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, said: 'I encourage the parties to form an executive as soon as possible. The people of Northern Ireland deserve a stable and accountable local government that delivers on the issues that matter most to them. 'The electorate delivered a number of messages on Thursday. They were clear that they want a fully functioning devolved government in Northern Ireland, they want the issues around the protocol addressed, and they want politics to work better. 'Over the coming days I will be meeting with all the party leaders and will urge them to restore the Stormont institutions at the earliest possible moment, starting with the nomination of an assembly speaker within eight days. 'The government remains committed to the Belfast [Good Friday] agreement and will continue to work with the Northern Ireland parties and the Irish government to deliver its vision for reconciliation, equality, respect for rights and parity of esteem. ' Peter Kyle, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, said his party could act as an 'honest broker'. He said: 'It is healthy for Northern Ireland that parties from either community can nominate a first minister and shows the Belfast/Good Friday agreement working. 'Unionism will still have a strong voice within power-sharing and calls for progress on the remaining issues of the protocol have been heard and should not prevent a return to the executive. 'The Labour party will always be an honest broker for Northern Ireland, and we stand ready to help Stormont deliver on the promise of these elections.' Ireland's taoiseach, Micheal Martin, said: 'It is now incumbent on all political parties and elected representatives to deliver on their mandate, through the nomination of a first and deputy first minister and the formation of a new executive to serve the interests of all of the people of Northern Ireland.' Sinn Fein's victory set up a clash with the DUP, which lost its pre-eminence and slumped to second place, with 21.3% of the first preference vote, a humiliation that underscored a wider crisis engulfing unionism in the wake of the Northern Ireland protocol, which put a post-Brexit trade border in the Irish Sea. The DUP leader, Jeffrey Donaldson, said on Saturday he would refuse to join a new devolved administration until the UK government 'dealt with' the protocol. That would paralyse Stormont, which would be run by a caretaker administration, and puts pressure on the prime minister to amend the protocol to end the stalemate. The impasse is expected to last weeks, if not months, and possibly lead to a new election. Last week, in a sign of uncertainty in the government over how to proceed, ministers in London made clear they would not be introducing a bill in this week's Queen's speech giving them powers to override the protocol, having previously briefed they would do so. On Saturday, , having seen her party increase its number of council seats in Scotland, despite having been in power for 15 years, Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon said Sinn Fein's performance in Northern Ireland had highlighted that there were now big questions around the future of the UK as a political entity. 'There's no doubt there are big fundamental questions being asked of the UK as a political entity right now,' Sturgeon declared. 'They're being asked here in Scotland, they're being asked in Northern Ireland, they're being asked in Wales, and I think we're going to see some fundamental changes to UK governance in the years to come and I am certain that one of those changes is going to be Scottish independence.' The renewed battle over Northern Ireland's constitutional place in the union came despite a dramatic surge in support for the centrist Alliance, which soared to 13.5%, putting it in third place and showing the growing clout of a third bloc that eschews nationalist and unionist labels. Alliance deputy leader and MP, Stephen Farry, said despite the Sinn Fein success, most voters had supported parties that wanted the protocol reformed or removed. He urged the DUP to work with the other parties, rather than 'plunge the UK into a new war with the EU'. Without a first minister and deputy first minister, the executive cannot function fully, with ministers limited to continuing but not making new policy, signing off budgets or introducing much-needed health reforms. Senior DUP sources say they will seek an urgent summit with ministers in Downing Street to press home the message that their boycott could put the assembly on pause until Christmas. If no executive is formed, the Northern Ireland secretary must call a new election, which must then be held within 12 weeks, pushing the chances of a full devolved government back to December.", "bcdd1fafd22c6f592d6ba86083e318db99e2dd4fd0692308a8a8fda4": "It was over the Thanksgiving holiday, catching up with old high school friends, that Frances Beal heard that Cordelia had died. Like the now 82-year-old Black feminist and activist, her friend had left home to go to college, but she didn't make it through her first year because, like anybody who wanted to terminate a pregnancy in America in 1958, she had been forced to undergo a backstreet abortion. 'She was dead because she'd had an illegal abortion. And it had gone bad. And if you take a look at the statistics, the number of woman that died from illegal abortions was tremendous,' Beal, who later joined the movement to legalise abortion, told the Observer. Now, more than 60 years after Cordelia's death and nearly half a century since Roe v Wade legalised abortion, she fears many more women could die after a leaked draft document revealed that the supreme court looks like it is preparing to overturn the landmark ruling. 'The overthrow of Roe v Wade equals the murder and assassination of women and that's something that I feel in my heart will happen again,' said the author of the pioneering 1969 pamphlet Double Jeopardy: To Be Black and Female. What happened last week should send an urgent warning signal not only to Americans but the world, she said, calling on people to take to the streets in their millions worldwide as they did following the police murder of George Floyd. 'Unfortunately, America often acts as a precursor of things to happen in other countries. And if they can attack and destroy a woman's right to choose an abortion in the United States it won't be too far before the right will be destroyed in other countries around the world.' She said women around the world needed to return to the attitude of women in the 60s to protect the lives of thousands whose lives would be put under threat. It's a basic human right for a woman to control her own body,' she said. The death of her friend enabled Beal to immediately take a strong stance on the issue of abortion access and she told her story to mass meetings in New York. To be facing the same struggle again is both depressing and angering, but she hopes it is an opportunity for women to organise and unite as they did in the 1960s and 70s. 'The question of access to abortion, even as it was legal, was somewhat limited because of class and racial differences. We don't forget that,' she said. 'But we can put aside those class and racial differences, as well as generational differences, and stand together and say: 'No, this is not something that we are going to accept. We didn't accept it back in the 1970s and we're not going to accept it today.'' Merle Hoffman, 76, has been on the frontlines of the movement for more than 50 years since giving up her plan to become a concert pianist. She founded Choices Women's Medical Center in Queens, New York, one of the first abortion clinics in the US. In 1989, she declared a 'state of emergency' in women's' rights in front of St Patrick's Cathedral with a huge coat hanger. Today she continues to use the coat hanger at protests and speeches, and she keeps it in her office. While the latest development is 'a tremendous disaster' and 'an egregious take back of a fundamental human and civil and constitutional right' she said it has been a very long time coming. 'They've been persistent, consistent and this has been their goal, and with the three new conservative judges on the court, they've managed to be in the position where they can actually do this.' Hoffman, who recently helped to found a new organisation, Rise Up 4 Abortion Rights, said it is a 'generational struggle' that she doesn't see coming to an end any time soon. 'It's strange, it's Kafkaesque. In a sense I'm reliving my youth.' After Roe v Wade, she said, many people 'metaphorically put their political feet up on their desks and said 'we've got it covered'.' She added: 'Well, you never have it covered. We have to fight issues in the civil rights struggle again, voting rights, all sorts of things, it's never covered because there's always opposition. It's a dynamic force.' Dr Nori Rost, a minister and clergy leader of the New York Society for Ethical Culture, was still at high school in Kansas when she attended her first pro-choice event in 1978. 'It was five years after Roe v Wade, so it was a strange mixture of jubilation and still maybe PTSD at where we had been because it was still so raw and recent in people's memories,' said Rost, now 59. She added: 'It's just shocking to think that we're back to where we were in 1972 - 50 years later, here we are in the same panic, in the same uncertainty about what's going to happen with people who need to access safe legal abortion.' She also fears the unravelling of abortion rights could also lead to the rollback of marriage equality. 'It's a very helpless feeling that five people can have the right to choose how millions of women in this country can access healthcare to have agency over their own bodies,' she said. 'It's very demoralising.'", "18b59571eef41e0e295345000d2dbe78f42035b467d3563e38ebae7d": "Three US tourists have died at a resort in the Bahamas after falling ill and another was airlifted to a hospital for treatment, island officials say.  Police were investigating and the cause of death was unknown but foul play 'is not suspected', the Bahamian acting prime minister, Chester Cooper, said in a statement on Friday. Their identities were not initially made public. The health minister, Dr Michael Darville, told Eyewitness News Bahamas on Saturday that some hotel guests went to a clinic on Thursday with nausea and vomiting, were treated and left. Three were later found dead. A fourth was flown to a hospital in New Providence. He said environmental health scientists, physicians and others were investigating to ensure there was not a public health hazard in the Atlantic island nation. 'We feel that what we are seeing is an isolated case associated in a particular area,' Darville said, adding that investigators were doing toxicology and blood tests to help determine the cause of the illness. The head of communications for the prime minister's office, Latrae L Rahming, tweeted that the deaths occurred at Sandals Emerald Bay in Exuma. A representative for Sandals confirmed the deaths in a statement to People Magazine and said the company was 'actively working to support both the investigation as well as the guests' families in every way possible'. There was no immediate further response to an inquiry to the hotel company on Saturday.", "01f1e664171e0ab6cb6e13dbd1f7a55ce2f46878e5c15a7b30ebb195": "New Zealand's prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has been forced into seven days of isolation after her partner tested positive to Covid-19. Ardern announced her Covid isolation in a social media post wishing a happy Mother's Day to her followers, after her fiance, Clarke Gayford, returned a positive Covid test on Sunday morning. Ardern said that she and her daughter, Neve, were feeling fine. 'Happy Mother's Day everyone! It's not even midday and already I'd say ours has been a mixed bag,' she wrote on Instagram. 'Neve was so excited that it was Mother's Day she got up nice and early to share this lovely card! (Who doesn't love being compared to hot lava ...).' 'The downside is Clarke woke up feeling a bit average and has tested positive for Covid, so we have 7 days of family time ahead of us!' Arden said that she will continue working remotely during her isolation period. 'I'll be working from home so anyone who watches question time, or is attending my Business NZ speech on Wednesday, you'll still see me remotely!' 'Otherwise, a happy Mother's Day to everyone who plays mum in anyone's life. You are as magical as hot lava is to a three-year-old!' she said. If Ardern does contract Covid in isolation and test positive after Tuesday, she will be required to isolate for a further week - meaning she could miss New Zealand's budget on 19 May.", "16f6f036d88fd305de9093c25f6c1cedb7976b11b1e7763ca1ae651a": "Chris and Rosie Ramsey are laughing, and making me laugh, as they tell a story about the other night. 'At one point, this guy got up,' says Chris, 'and his beef with his girlfriend is about her toenail. He says: 'She keeps trying to make me cut her massive toenail.' So we were like, 'Let us see it then,' and she got up onstage and came to the sofa with the guests...' 'And she's absolutely stunning...' says Rosie. 'Stunning lass, gorgeous,' agrees Chris. 'And it was her little toe on her right foot...' 'Thicker than it was wide...' 'Like a solid Rice Krispie. And he tries. And the clippers just don't go down on it.' 'It was,' says Rosie, 'brilliant.' Welcome, gentle reader, to life with the Ramseys. Domestic, honest, intimate, silly, full of vaguely disgusting stories about everyday events you might not recount to your great-aunt, but you would definitely tell a friend. Perhaps you don't find a Rice Krispie toenail funny, but I'd say you probably would if Chris and Rosie were describing it. It is, as Frank Carson used to say, the way they tell 'em. They are funny people and, though this is not true of all funny people, they are funnier together than apart. At the moment, they're bustling around the rooms of a supercool east London house that's been hired for the photoshoot. 'Ooh, these chairs are nice, Chris,' says Rosie, about some outdoor seats. They're having their own new house done up (a six bed-er in the countryside near South Shields) and are at the garden-fouffing stage. 'Not sure about these table edges, though,' she says. 'No good for kids.' Chris is interested in the food on offer. 'All vegan?' he says. 'I'm starting to try that more. Though we did go to a London hotel for breakfast recently and when they said that the chia balls were all sold out, we weren't that disappointed. We are from the northeast.' Do you know the Ramseys? If you listen to their weekly podcast, Shagged Married Annoyed, you may well feel - as I do - as though they're your long-term friends. If you haven't heard it, let me sell it to you. It's an hour of them chatting to each other. Yes, there are regular items, such as the 'Lucrative sponsor opportunity', an excuse for them to bitch about something that's irritating, such as people who comment on how much luggage you have with you when you're on holiday, or who hold their dogs up for you to talk to when you're FaceTiming; more importantly, there's the 'What's your beef?' section where they both bring up something that has annoyed them about the other. Plus, reader's emails, which provide loads of the fun: the very first episode featured a woman writing in about treating her husband to 'his first foursome, next Wednesday'. Really, though, SMA is just an hour of daftness, of the Ramseys being silly and making each other laugh. Both from South Shields, the pair have been together for 10 years and are parents to two little boys, Robin and Rafe. Chris is a working comedian, appearing on Strictly and Taskmaster, and is currently touring the UK with his one-man show. But the Ramseys' humour isn't scripted: it bubbles up and out of their relationship. And it has made SMA one of the most successful podcasts in the UK. Launched in 2019, it immediately zoomed into the iTunes Top 10, where it stayed: it's the only podcast that has ever stayed in the Top 10 for a whole year. As of last month, it has 100m listeners. When they decided to take the show on tour last year, they sold out Wembley Arena in a day. And then they sold out the O2 (the only podcasters ever to do so: they were given a commemorative plaque). Now, they're about to do a BBC chatshow (the toenail story comes from a pilot programme they did the other day). Featuring celebrity guests and an up-for-it audience, it's already a success. The website crashed when tickets went up online; they set it up again the next day and yes, it crashed again. Chris and Rosie aren't famous people trying to convince us they're normal; they're normal people who have become famous. 'Are we?' wonders Rosie. 'I don't feel like we're well-known at all. Maybe it's because we don't live in the hustle and bustle, or because we do the podcast at home, and you don't see the results of it all the time... I'm always excited when people come up to us. We try to be nice, and it's easy because people are nice to us.' 'My mam once saw Colin Firth checking into a hotel,' says Chris, 'with his kids and some family and he turned around and looked at her. And she loves Colin Firth. And poor guy, she says to this day he gave her a horrible look.' Rosie: 'He was just busy. He just looked over at a stranger.' Chris: 'She literally has never got over it. That tiny moment where this poor guy is on holiday and just glances at my mam, and my mam takes it utterly personally.' We settle outside in the spring sunshine, Chris in Ray-Bans, Rosie in big round sunnies, to talk about their telly venture. The show is being filmed in the same studio as Graham Norton's show and I can imagine a similar vibe: famous people on a sofa, funny audience interaction. 'It's even more about the audience,' says Chris. 'The guys have sent beefs in, but they don't know who's going to be picked. And we don't know either. We just take the beef out of the envelope and that's the first time we see it and we react.' This is exactly how they did their live show - 'for three-quarters of the show, we didn't know what we'd be doing,' says Rosie. It's the key to everything, they think. 'If someone says something that's really disgusting, if you already know what's going to happen, you're kind of in on it,' says Chris. 'It's about our bewilderment and dumbfoundment: 'What the bloody hell is this?' We don't over-rehearse. We're not those kind of people.' Rosie is excited about the show, but nervous: 'It's a world Chris has been in for a long time, and I haven't. It's really new to me.' Chris: 'But I keep telling her she's got no reason to feel nervous. Some of the lines she came out with at the pilot, off the cuff, so funny, so hilarious... She's so good at it.' He's right; it's Rosie who makes their show work. There are plenty of witty comedians out there, but not many with a funny life-partner who doesn't compete (John Richardson and Lucy Beaumont? Though their shows are written as though they're competitive). Unusually, it was Chris's audience that demanded Rosie join in: in 2019, when he was promoting his Comedy Central solo show, he did some Facebook Lives from home, and Rosie kept heckling. She proved so popular that when he actually did the show, the audience spontaneously chanted her name. No wonder they thought they might try something together. At the time Rosie was - and still is - a stay-at-home mum, setting up mother and toddler groups, gritting her teeth through long summer holidays. Before having children, she'd been a performer, dancing and singing in hotels abroad, working as a Pontins' blue coat, co-hosting a local radio show. She loved it, but had never had huge success. Born Rosie Winter, she's the middle child of three, to parents who are 'grafters': a dad who worked for the Prudential, 'going round houses, collecting mortgages', and a mum who was a nurse. At some point, her dad did a masters degree (he now works for the NHS as a drug and alcohol abuse worker); while he did, the family lived on income support. Rosie's young life was noisy and fun; she has 25 cousins and describes her family as 'big, loud, welcoming, loving, would give you the shirt off their back if you needed it. No money. But full of fun, always up for a laugh. Cry together, laugh together.' ('Every time they get together it's like a Christmas party,' says Chris.) Rosie was an outgoing child, 'a show off', convinced she was going to be an actor or a popstar. 'I don't even know if I was any good, I just loved the spotlight.' She auditioned for London drama schools, but her parents couldn't afford to send her there; she did open auditions for the West End, but got nothing. Chris: 'Didn't you get to the final five or something for a Lord of the Rings musical?' Rosie: 'I did! For the Hobbit part.' This makes Chris howl; he makes a note in his phone. They often do this, to remind them to talk about something in their podcast. One of them will do something silly and notice the other subtly (or not so subtly) jotting it down for later broadcast use. Chris also grew up in South Shields, close to Rosie, though they didn't know each other as kids. His parents, he says, are quieter. 'They would work during the week, go out Friday, go out Saturday, chill out Sunday. Very organised, very nine to five.' His dad worked at the pit, until the mines all closed and he went to work as a delivery driver; his mum worked for the NHS. They're both retired now and, along with Rosie's parents, help the Ramseys out with childcare. He is an only child - 'typical comedian,' says Rosie - who didn't really know what he wanted to do with his life, though he knew he liked making people laugh. He can remember being 11 or 12, and going on holiday with his parents and meeting some strange posh kids and thinking, 'I'll tell everyone about them when I get back. And when I did,' he says, 'there was this moment where all my mates were sitting cross-legged on a driveway and I was standing up next to the fence, on a little patch of grass, and I was telling them all about my holiday, and they were falling about. And something clicked.' He started constructing little routines in his head, but it wasn't until he left school and was at university that a friend, Carl Hutchinson, now also a comedian, told him about open spots at comedy shows. 'It was this moment where someone pulled the curtain back and went, 'There's a door here.' And I just belted through it and never looked back.' Chris can remember his first show; he told a joke about STIs and Marks & Spencer. It was at the Dog and Parrot in Newcastle. ('It's near the Arena,' says Rosie, 'and every time he does the Arena now, it's like: 'I was just over there, the Dog and Parrot.' Every time. I feel like you have to say it now, because if you don't say it, it's all going to go away.') Though they remember seeing each other around when they were young (Rosie dated an older guy from Chris's estate when she was 14), and went to the same sixth-form college, it wasn't until 2012, when they bumped into each other at a local nightclub, that they got together; once, Rosie said, she realised Chris wasn't quite as cocky as she'd thought. Chris appeals to women: his comedy audience has always skewed more female and it's similar for SMA, especially now Rosie's there. Fans tend to be younger than the Ramseys, in their early 20s, and what Chris and Rosie are about, very definitely, is bringing them all together. 'Some comedians can walk into a room,' says Chris, 'and they can do a massive bit on, like, Brexit. And they can split the room in half, and go, 'That was good.' But in my eyes, I think they died on their arse because half those people hated them. It's clever, but you're there to make them laugh, dude.' For this reason, on the podcast they steer clear of divisive topics, like football or politics, though I did notice that in one episode, they brought up the government's many lockdown cheese and wine parties. Rosie: 'We do talk about politics at home, we're interested in it. We live in this world and we're of an age where we've got mortgages, we've got children. But we just don't feel like it needs to be in our show. Also, I don't know about you, but I change my opinion all the time...' Chris: 'But when something is as cut and dried as, they had parties when we weren't allowed, there can't be anyone emailing in going, 'How dare you? They deserved those parties.' Wine and cheese parties, when people are waving at their grandkids through windows? I'm never going to change my opinion on that.' Rosie: 'There's nothing to argue about.' From there we veer off on to Will Smith (they are huge fans, especially Chris: 'It was awful, the Oscars, like watching your dad lose his temper properly, like him having a fight in the pub'); how Chris went away on tour just 10 days after Robin was born: 'Really, really hard,' says Rosie, 'and I tried to do everything myself'; how Chris is stuck in his ways: 'I listen to Absolute 80s, I've got the Guardians of the Galaxy playlist and I watch Family Guy and UFC on the telly'. They let each other speak, they chime in with jokes and support; they really do seem to have a good working marriage, and they're sure the podcast has improved it. After all, serious relationship counsellors often advise couples to have a weekly conference in order to talk through differences. 'Obviously we have rows,' says Rosie. 'We don't go straight to the podcast and laugh about it. You have time to mellow, and then you have a nice day, and you're friends again. Then being able to talk about it after is really healthy.' Chris: 'It can be really bad in the moment, because Rosie's better at it then, but, later on, I can pull it apart on the podcast and get an apology. It's a very clever system.' Rosie: 'Yeah, he comes on the podcast and annihilates me. And I'm like, 'But I won this in the moment!' Chris: 'Do you know what I remembered the other day? Years ago, before we did the podcast, your mam would come round, and you would kick off at me because I would roast you in front of people. I'd be like, 'Sandra, do you see what she's done with this dishwasher?'' Rosie: 'Yes, you did that all the time. I hated it. Why would you just rip the piss out of me in front of people?' Chris: 'And now we do it for a job!'

Speaking at a rally in Sao Paulo, where the one-time lathe operator began his spectacular rise to power as a union leader more than four decades ago, Lula publicly spelled out his ambition to reclaim the presidency for the first time. 'I am certain that we are going to manage to stage the greatest peaceful revolution the world has ever seen,' the 76-year-old leftist told thousands of supporters, who had gathered for the launch of what Lula called a cross-party anti-Bolsonaro alliance called Vamos Juntos Pelo Brasil, or Let's Pull Together for Brazil. 'We have a dream. We are moved by hope - and there is no force greater than the hope of a people who know they can be happy once more ... Once again we are going to care for Brazil and the Brazilian people,' Lula said. The seats before him were filled by a who's who of the Brazilian left, as well as celebrities, intellectuals, union leaders and grassroots activists who had travelled from all across the country - united in their desire to stop Bolsonaro returning to power when nearly 150 million Brazilians choose their next leader in October. 'Bolsonaro represents the death of our people, our extermination ... Lula's the opposite - he represents hope,' said Nathalia Purificacao, 23, an Afro-Brazilian activist from Bom Jesus da Lapa in the north-eastern state of Bahia. Ademario Nogueira, a 58-year-old campaigner from the capital, Brasilia, brandished a portrait of his bearded leader. 'He's the horseman of hope,' Nogueira said of Lula, a two-term president from 2003 to 2010 who was barred from the 2018 election after being jailed on controversial corruption charges that were annulled last year. Opinion polls suggest Lula is on course to win his sixth presidential run since he first tried to become the leader of South America's largest democracy in 1989. One survey, released on the eve of Lula's announcement, gave him a 13% lead over Bolsonaro in the first round and a 20% lead in a second round runoff. Sixty per cent of voters said they would not vote for Bolsonaro - who is widely blamed for mishandling a Covid outbreak that has killed nearly 665,000 citizens - under any circumstance. More than 60% believe the economy is going in the wrong direction, with rising inflation, high unemployment and a growing cost of living crisis. 'It's Lula's to lose, clearly,' said Felipe Nunes, the head of the polling group Quaest. Even so, in recent weeks there have been signs of nervousness among Lula allies and progressive Brazilians desperate to see the back of Bolsonaro, after a series of unforced bloopers from the veteran leftist. Last weekend Lula was forced to apologise after suggesting police officers were not human beings. This week he was criticised for claiming the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, were equally to blame for the war there. 'If Lula carries on with this verbal incontinence ... he'll give the current occupant of the presidential palace a serious shot at re-election,' the Brazilian author Paulo Coelho warned on Twitter. Some critics complain Lula has failed to offer a clear vision for the future and is relying too heavily on rekindling nostalgia over his two-term presidency, when a global commodity boom helped him pump vast sums into poverty reduction schemes and infrastructure projects. In an interview with Time magazine, published on the eve of Saturday's event, Lula declared: 'Instead of asking what I will do, just look at what I have done'. Those accomplishments - which included helping millions escape poverty and expanding access to education - were given centre stage at Saturday's event in Sao Paulo, the city to which a 10-year-old Lula moved in 1955, three years after his family fled rural hardship in the north-eastern state of Pernambuco. The auditorium was plastered with photographs remembering Lula's years in power. Before his speech, videos were shown in which he appeared alongside global figures such as Barack Obama, George W Bush and Queen Elizabeth. 'He's the best president in the history of Brazil,' said Nogueira, an activist from Lula's Worker's party (PT). 'Brazil is desperate to be happy again.' Lula, who was freed up to run in the 2022 election after the supreme court annulled his convictions, told supporters that at the coming election Brazil would have the chance to decide which country it wanted to be. 'The Brazil of democracy or authoritarianism ... The Brazil of knowledge and tolerance or the Brazil of obscurantism and violence, of education and culture or of revolvers and rifles.' 'It has never, ever been so easy to choose,' Lula added with a smile. 'And never has it been more important to make the right choice.' Also on show was Lula's attempt to build a broad coalition capable of defeating Bolsonaro, including parties from outside the left. Lula's running mate, the centre-right former Sao Paulo governor Geraldo Alckmin, was unable to attend after contracting Covid but in a video message told the audience that unity was essential to protect democracy and defeat 'the most disastrous and most cruel government in Brazilian history'. Juliano Medeiros, the president of the leftwing Socialism and Liberty party (PSOL), said it was essential for the opposition to coalesce, as it failed to do before Bolsonaro's shock 2018 election. The anti-Bolsonaro movement also urgently needed to ensure the 2022 campaign was based on exposing Bolsonaro's failures and the real economic problems facing Brazil's 215 million citizens. 'In 2018 it was Bolsonarismo and the far right that set the agenda: it was all about anti-communism and corruption and culture wars. This time our challenge is to put unemployment, inflation, hunger and equality at the centre of the debate,' Medeiros said, as delegates streamed into the convention centre. Activists voiced optimism that Bolsonaro's days in power were numbered. 'I don't have the words to describe my happiness,' said Susy Keith, a 45-year-old producer from Rio who was dressed as a bright red star. However, many progressives feel profound trepidation over the coming months, with Brazil's pro-gun president billing the election as an epochal struggle between ultraconservative 'good' and the 'evil' left. 'My main worry is violence. I think there's a real chance we will see fighting in the streets. These are going to be the most polarised elections on Earth,' said Celso Rocha de Barros, a columnist for the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper. On Saturday Lula urged supporters to resist provocation during the campaign and to face their opponents with love, not hate. 'We are going to win this battle for democracy with smiles, affection, love, peace and harmony,' he said.", "d1994f0a5be62d4a3bf5afd8f303c6639ff8ab66dfe65e891da74115": "At least 14 Cypriots were tortured then murdered by UK forces during an armed uprising in the late 1950s, according to newly unearthed evidence that raises fresh questions over another shocking chapter of Britain's colonial history. Testimony from British veterans and Cypriot rebel fighters, along with postmortem and morgue records, as well as previously undisclosed material from Cypriot archives, suggest that the victims died after being interrogated by UK officers. The dead, all men aged between 17 and 37, were arrested on suspicion of being part of the National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters, a paramilitary organisation known as EOKA, which orchestrated a guerrilla campaign to overthrow British control in Cyprus. Photographs from the Cyprus National Archives corroborate signs of torture on their bodies. In some cases, the images appear to show mutilation of the genitals. A witness to one of the deaths said: 'I saw the soldiers pulling Nicos [Georgiou] out of his cell, almost unconscious, with foam coming out of his mouth. He was making an awful sound like a lion growling as he lay dying. They let him die on the cement outside.' Although claims that the British military used torture during their occupation of Cyprus have circulated for years, it is the first time that UK forces, including its intelligence services, are accused of a campaign of extrajudicial killings during the 1955 to 1959 uprising. In 2019, the UK government paid PS1m damages to 33 Cypriots who alleged they were tortured by British forces. Among them was a girl, 16 years old at the time, who said she was repeatedly raped by soldiers. Although the government insisted the payout was not 'any admission of liability', the fresh details will sharpen scrutiny over the true extent of atrocities committed during the campaign to end British colonial rule on the Mediterranean island. The new claims feature in a book, 14 Crimes of Empire, published in Greek, which investigates the circumstances behind the deaths of the 14 men. Elina Stamatiou, the Cypriot author who spent three years investigating the deaths, said the UK government needed to acknowledge its role in their fate. 'Justice must be served. I also think that an official apology to the families of these victims would be very important, even if it comes 65 years later. The families' wounds are still open,' she said. In what was known as the Cyprus emergency, EOKA launched an insurgency against British authorities who insisted that the island should 'never have self-determination'. In response to the insurrection, Cyprus was flooded with thousands of British soldiers in an ultimately futile attempt to crush the island's hopes of independence. Some 371 British soldiers died, compared with around 90 EOKA fighters. Among them was Georgios Christoforou, 18, who was arrested in the city of Paphos in 1958. Fellow detainees witnessed him being escorted into a British interrogation room and emerging with his 'face covered with blood and he could not walk'. One recalled 'moaning and noises' coming from the room and later heard Christoforou screaming. Another witness testified that he heard the teenager's interrogator say: 'If you do not tell us the truth, we shall kill you.' Images of Christoforou in the morgue show his face bloodied and disfigured. Clinical documents show that he died from internal injuries on 22 November 'whilst in custody from injuries due to a blow or fall or some other form of violence but there is no evidence to show when, where, how and in what manner he received the injuries which caused his death'. One of the youngest of the 14 men allegedly killed in detention by the British was 17-year-old Lucas Louka, an EOKA member who died in the city of Famagusta in 1958 after what appears to be a brutal beating from an English military police officer. Photographs from the morgue indicate signs of baton strikes on his back, with the fatal blow on the left side of his head. A friend of Louka's said he saw him being 'assaulted' by a British military captain. Another saw the teenager attacked 'with a heavy rod' by the same officer. The friend added: 'He started beating the deceased everywhere, on the head, body. I saw Louka lying on the bed and the captain beating him.' Veteran EOKA fighter Michalakis Moustakas described how Nicos Georgiou, 37, who was arrested in the village of Platres, died in detention. Held in a cell next to Georgiou, Moustakas said they were forced to sleep naked on cement, were fed urine, repeatedly beaten and dragged by their genitals. The witness, now 86, said he watched Georgiou being dragged out of his cell with foam coming from his mouth. 'Every night when I go to bed, I can still hear his growling sound while dying,' said Moustakas. Images taken in the morgue show Georgiou's body covered with bruises along with head injuries. British veterans who served in Cyprus have also offered accounts that contradict the UK's official version. A senior officer wrote an account of the death of EOKA member Spyros Hadjiyiacoumi. The late major Michael Stourton attempted to raise his concerns over the torture of the 27-year-old father of four at a British interrogation centre in the town of Kythrea. His efforts to flag the issue were quashed by Ministry of Defence censors who erased the chapter from the official history of the Grenadier Guards. Two other EOKA members who were tortured in the same hut as Hadjiyiakoumi but survived told how British interrogators placed a metal bucket on their heads and struck it, and stabbed their feet with a bayonet. The coroner's report from the time claimed the injuries 'were caused during an unsuccessful attempt to escape from lawful custody'. Another British veteran also offered key evidence into the death of another of the 14 - Andreas Panayiotou, a 31-year-old EOKA member who died in a Platres hotel requisitioned by the British army. Brian Robertson, 85, who served in Platres with the Gordon Highlanders from October 1955 to December 1956, said that a friend called Kevin Taylor, who served in the military medical inspection room, told him that a detainee had died after being tied up in a freezing water fountain all night. Robertson, from Aberdeen, said the chief doctor was apparently horrified and refused to sign the death certificate, forcing the officers involved to summon another doctor from the Cypriot capital, Nicosia. 'They had to get another old army doctor to sign the death certificate. I am certain the British did engage in the use of torture,' Robertson said. Two of the bodies of the 14 men identified by Stamatiou are still missing and are believed to be secretly buried. British accounts state that both men managed to escape from detention, though neither has been seen since. One of them - 27-year-old Nicolaos Yiangou - was last seen being driven away in a black Morris minor car after being interrogated by British secret services, police and soldiers. The British military continues to operate two bases in Cyprus, one close to the city of Limassol and one in Dhekhelia. The Foreign Office referred its current position to a 2019 statement from then Foreign Office minister Alan Duncan which said that the 'passage of time means that it is now no longer possible to establish all of the facts with certainty.' It added:  'The UK government acknowledges the strongly held views of many Cypriots about the emergency' and said that the violence was a 'matter of regret.'", "569efff6079a19c9bbdc86dabd30665ac438323186897d0f1da5b896": "", "11e0934a22b8794c2ed433a2e89c15fd8a88d217c49f601908ed7530": "Amber Heard was asked in court last week if she recognized the name Carly Simon, soon after her attorneys introduced an exhibit of a mirror that they say Johnny Depp had defaced in tight, punctuated script after severing part of his middle finger in what his former wife described as a drug- and alcohol-induced blackout. The note read: 'Call Carly Simon. She said it better. Bye.' Heard testified she wasn't familiar with Simon or her work. But , one can reasonably speculate, it was referring to You're So Vain, Simon's 1972 hit. Depp's attorneys may take up the issue on cross-examination the week after next. Or the week after that. So it goes with the Depp-Heard defamation case in Fairfax, Virginia. A cautionary tale, certainly, with disturbing allegations of domestic and sexual violence. But also a man-woman fight, part gender-switch Sunset Boulevard, part Mean Girls, with flashbacks and still images taken - appropriately enough given the sinister if not vampiric nature of the relationship - in Bela Lugosi's old house. Which narrative jurors choose will not be known until after 27 May, when attorneys will deliver closing arguments. For now, with the court out next week - the judge, Penny Azcarate, is at an unrelated judicial conference - jurors are left to mull the last two days of Heard's take on her turbulent marriage. 'Two skilled actors on the stand as witnesses could be equally resonant without regard to exactly where the truth is in their narratives,' said Nancianne Aydelotte, a New Jersey lawyer. 'This is very challenging for jurors, who might find what the plaintiff said to be compelling and is then equally moved by the defendant.' Heard's testimony, highly charged at times, has been delivered while keeping eye contact with jurors. Depp has kept his head down, occasionally consulting with his lawyers, usually when he seems to find something implausible - for example, that he ingested eight to 10 ecstasy pills in one sitting in Australia, or took quaaludes in Los Angeles. Heard's overall story is that she was courted and seduced, was bought a colt, and fell madly in love with a movie star - 'when I was around Johnny I felt like the most beautiful person in the world' - while the world beyond their 'bubble' was kept in abeyance. 'We weren't doing normal life stuff,' Heard said. 'We weren't stuck in traffic with each other, we weren't going to the grocery store and doing life. We were hiding in these places around the world.' That bubble, she testified, started to deflate when Depp began to disappear and she didn't know how to find or reach him. Heard argued that Depp became threatened by her career and jealous of her co-stars. She testified that Depp threatened her life shortly after the pair were married, and that just weeks later, in Australia while filming the fifth Pirates of the Caribbean movie, he sexually assaulted her with a bottle of Maker's Mark.'I'll fucking kill you,' Heard alleged that Depp yelled. 'I was scared,' she added. 'I had just married him.' Months later, Heard alleged, Depp broke her nose and ripped out chunks of hair in another violent encounter. Depp has testified that he never hit Heard, and that she was the one who was the abuser, including when she threw a bottle of vodka at him, severing his finger. Heard testified that in her effort to help Depp get sober, she sought help through Al-Anon, and sought to distance herself from the relationship, but was drawn back in whenever Depp achieved brief periods of sobriety and when the 'monster' that the pair called his intoxicated persona was subdued. But at each turn, she said, his efforts were hindered by an entourage - his security team, assistants, hangers-on - who shielded him from the consequences of his drug and alcohol use. In London, she said, his security carried him into their rented home 'like a baby'. Some of the most interesting testimony of the past week came from Depp's accountants. One estimated that Depp had lost $40m in earnings as a result of Heard's 2018 Washington Post opinion piece, in which she described herself as 'a public figure representing domestic abuse'. Hollywood dealmaker Richard Marks, a Depp witness, told the court that the film-making community had interpreted Heard's message loud and clear. 'That actor is synonymous with the product,' Marks said. 'When hiring that actor or actress, you want a reputation that supports the value that you spent on creating that product. Especially in the last five years, with the #MeToo movement, you wouldn't want negativity hiring an actor who, quote-unquote, had been canceled.' Outside of the proceedings, Heard's PR team have accused Depp of failing to take responsibility. 'One of Ms Heard's disappointments is Mr Depp's inability to distinguish fact from fiction - a malady which appears to have spread to his legal team,' a spokesperson said in email to reporters on Friday. A Depp flack countered that Heard had delivered 'the performance of her life' and that his attorneys look forward to cross-examining her. Public relations experts are divided over the consequences of Depp's $50m defamation claim and Heard's $100m counter-claim. 'This case should serve as a cautionary tale to high-profile people living in the public eye: when you decide to make an abuse allegation, or discuss your personal life in the form of an op-ed, a televised interview, or conversation with a reporter, you run the risk of having to publicly discuss all sorts of ugly private details,' says Evan Nierman at Red Banyan. 'It's remarkable that Heard chose to author the op-ed that started this entire saga, and that Depp decided to pursue legal action, given that both have more skeletons in their closets than a haunted house.' But Juda Engelmayer at Herald PR says that no matter what the verdict in the case, Depp has afforded himself the opportunity to make his case in the court of public opinion. 'He got to tell his narrative rather than have it be told by Heard in the Washington Post. He entertained, and ended up getting a lot of people, including female audiences members, on his side. That's how he wins, whatever the verdict, because he wants the world to see that he is still capable of producing fans and producing entertainment.' For Heard, the issue may be more complex. 'She was considered a hero for putting out her narrative, so now she comes out more of a hero for taking the abuse in her marriage, if believed, and for taking abuse in court last week when he was entertaining, witty, taking it lightly and getting laughs. 'She's coming off looking good also,' says Engelmayer. 'She's being strong, bold and unafraid, sitting up there telling her story. She's straightforward, and not backing away from it, and fighting for what she believes is right.' Depp, Engelmayer believes, will slowly find his way back into movies, though perhaps not as prominently as before. Heard, he says, also will find her way back. 'She'll get recast in some films to test the waters to see if she has that moxie. She was never as big as Depp, but a lot of studios may think putting her in is a good draw for women, and for progressives who think she was strong and deserves a chance. She'll get the roles, and the box office will tell if she can command them.'", "9e31642f8636428b59571029695a031c7ccd910fc6c495a302310bc2": "A Biden administration official warned Friday that there could be 100m Covid-19 infections this fall and winter, potentially spurring a surge in hospitalizations and deaths. The White House is preparing backup plans for providing vaccines to US residents if lawmakers refuse to provide more funds for coronavirus response efforts, the New York Times reported. The White House has ramped up efforts to boost the country's preparedness and urge Congress to allocate billions to buy additional vaccines, therapeutics and tests, but additional emergency funding is uncertain. Biden has requested $22.5bn for Covid-19; Republicans have pushed for just $10bn, however, and removed $5bn in international coronavirus assistance from this request, the Times said. The US coronavirus death toll is expected to reach 1m this week. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said last week that 60% of US residents have been infected with Covid-19, the Washington Post reported. The official's dire projection was based on several models, not new data, and was not a formal prediction. These models operate with the premise that Omicron and its sub-variants will keep driving community transmission - and that a significantly different strain will not emerge, according to the Washington Post. This prediction was also made with the assumption that there will not be additional federal aid, the Times reported. The model also assumed that many vaccinated people, and persons who were previously infected, would get Covid-19 again. Several public health experts say that a dramatic wave during cold-weather months is possible, as immunity from vaccines declines over time. This drop in immunity comes amid variants that are more capable of evading immunity - and as officials continue to relax public health restrictions, the Post said. The officials projected that the surge would start in the south - where vaccination and booster rates lag - as more people congregate indoors. Authorities fear the uptick will tear through the supply of tests and anti-viral treatments, leaving the US ill-prepared to combat the fall and winter uptick, the Post said. On Friday, the seven-day US average of new infections totaled almost 71,000 - more than twice the 29,312 weekly average just five weeks ago. Justin Lessler, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina's school of global public health, told the Post: 'What they're saying seems reasonable - it's on the pessimistic side of what we projected in the Covid-19 scenario modeling run.' 'It's always hard to predict the future when it comes to Covid, but I think we're at a point now where it's even harder than normal,' Lessler continued. 'Because there's so much sensitivity, in terms of these long-term trends, to things we don't understand exactly about the virus and about [human] behavior.'", "3830a369a6d992e1d5241163202f46126bb27072435b191c58a934f2": "The Taliban have ordered all women to cover their faces in public in Afghanistan, the latest sweeping restriction by a government that has taken away women's right to travel long distances alone, work outside healthcare or education, and receive a secondary education. In a cruel twist, the decree makes women's relatives and employers the enforcers. If their faces are seen in public, their male 'guardian' will be fined, then jailed. If the woman who goes out uncovered or her relative work for the government, they must be fired. It suggested women should not leave their homes at all if possible, saying that was 'the best option to observe the sharia hijab', essentially imposing the extreme traditions of conservative parts of rural areas on all women. 'For all dignified Afghan women wearing hijab is necessary and the best hijab is chadori [the burqa], which is part of our tradition and is respectful,' Shir Mohammad, an official from the vice and virtue ministry, told a conference in Kabul, AP reported. 'Those women who are not too old or young must cover their face, except the eyes.' The all-enveloping burqa, traditional in Afghanistan, allows women to see only through a small grille. The alternative would be the niqab, which covers the face but not the eyes. While almost all adult women in Afghanistan wear some form of hijab, many in cities cover only their hair. The latest restrictions on women, part of a system of controls that activists have attacked as 'gender apartheid', are likely to set back the Taliban's bid for international recognition and support, as the country grapples with an economic crisis and widespread hunger. 'The world is a bystander to our pain, to an apartheid, to complete tyranny,' Shaharzad Akhbar, the former head of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, now living abroad in exile, said on Twitter. 'So much pain and grief for women of my country, my heart is exploding. So much hatred and anger against Taliban, enemies of women, enforcers of gender apartheid, enemies of Afghanistan and humanity.' The Foreign Office said the Taliban could not hope for international recognition or an end to sanctions imposed when they were an insurgent group carrying out regular suicide attacks that took a heavy civilian toll, if they did not live up to obligations on protecting women. 'Responsibility for what happens in Afghanistan lies with the Taliban,' a spokesperson said. 'We will judge them by their actions, not their words. If they want international acceptance, they must live up to their obligations and commitments, particularly on the rights of women and girls.' The group had promised it had changed over the two decades since it ran Afghanistan as a brutal, impoverished theocracy in the late 1990s, where women were barred from almost all work and education. But since sweeping to power last August, increasingly harsh restrictions on women's rights suggest that pledge was rhetoric designed to secure the departure of US forces, as many activists warned at the time. Perhaps most painful was the abrupt U-turn in March on reopening girls' secondary schools, already shuttered for six months since the Taliban swept to power. Students were back in class, at their desks and ready to learn when hardliners ordered them to return home. Many left sobbing. 'This should finally put to rest the last bits of speculation about the 'Taliban 2.0',' said Heather Barr, associate women's rights director at Human Rights Watch. 'The strategy of compelling men to be the enforcers on their own relatives is particularly disturbing, because it means women can't even make their own decisions about what risks they are going to take. 'One of the big questions is what does the world do about this? We've been waiting since last August to see how the international community responds, and we haven't seen anything serious or coherent. This is particularly frustrating from several countries that claim to have a 'feminist foreign policy'.' The Taliban have also prevented women from protesting, and many former activists, journalists, security force members and other high-profile women have been in hiding for months after several attacks and murders. Although the new ruling is worrying, many women have even more serious concerns, said Hasina Safi, former minister for women's affairs. 'Women are even more urgently concerned about their mobility, education and health, participation security and safety.'", "330a5d9a54007a72af1d33e4bc5574fe94a457c6ec2293c017fd626a": "When Mark Tucker arrived as HSBC's new chairman on a cloudy London day in October 2017, he was prepared for a challenge. The former insurance boss was the first outsider to lead the now 157-year-old bank, which was in the middle of a period of intense upheaval. HSBC was slimming down its investment bank, selling poorly performing businesses and slashing thousands of jobs as it tried to adapt to the post-financial-crisis era. While Tucker was well equipped to guide the lender through that period of turmoil, he must now wrestle with a far bigger existential question - should the bank be broken up?  He has form on handling such decisions: as head of insurer Prudential in the late 2000s, he withstood calls for splitting the weaker UK business away from its more lucrative Asian operations, which made up more than half of profits from new business. Yet his resistance there ultimately proved futile. Prudential eventually did split - albeit nearly a decade after Tucker's departure. A similar dilemma now faces him at HSBC, after its largest investor, the Chinese insurance group Ping An, revived calls to separate the bank's profitable Asian business from the rest of the lender's operations. HSBC's Scottish founder, Sir Thomas Sutherland, envisioned a Hong Kong-based lender that would finance trade between Europe and Asia when he launched the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in 1865. But the bank's successes have largely mirrored the rise of globalisation, having splashed cash on a string of acquisitions since the 1970s - including Britain's Midland Bank in 1992 - as international business boomed. By the 2008 financial crisis - by which time HSBC had a presence in 86 countries and had long since shifted its headquarters to London - the bank's traditional home markets still accounted for most of its profits. 'It was strange situation in which the bank was making most of its money in territories it had originally been in before the global push abroad,' said David Kynaston, the historian and author of The Lion Wakes: A Modern History of HSBC. Subsequent shareholder pressure to capitalise on its strengths meant backtracking on some of those projects. Before publicly pushing for a breakup, Ping An had privately called for HSBC to get out of money-draining assets in the west, refocus on Asia, and embark on a cost-cutting scheme to trim excesses. 'Over the last 15 years or so, there's been quite a significant rowing back,' Kynaston said, noting HSBC's recent decision to ditch its retail banks in the US and France, and the shrinking of its footprint from 86 to 64 countries since the financial crisis. The financial arguments for pruning its global network have since been amplified into debate over a breakup. Ping An has expressed disappointment at the return on its investment, having seen the dividend cancelled during the first UK lockdown, and reinstated at only half the level seen before the pandemic. Some have suggested that any shareholder vote on a split of HSBC's Asian and western operations would also be a referendum on the bank's strategy under Tucker, a former trainee professional footballer and diehard Chelsea FC fan. Tucker clashed with, and had a hand in ousting, chief executive John Flint, who had been in post less than two years, in August 2019, before triggering a more ambitious cost-cutting agenda - involving about 35,000 job losses - under Flint's replacement, Noel Quinn. Ping An's calls for a split have added fuel to an already burning fire. HSBC's role straddling east and west has been eroded by an increasingly polarised political climate and a wave of protectionism that was turbocharged by Donald Trump's trade war with China and has gained further traction during the pandemic. Most notably, HSBC has struggled to navigate pressures from Washington and London on one side, and Beijing on the other, after the bank controversially accepted China's authoritarian crackdown on democracy in Hong Kong in 2020. Meanwhile, the fact that UK and US regulators have a hold over HSBC even though it makes most of its profits in Asia has ruffled feathers across its investor base. HSBC's leadership has consistently defended itself against political pressure to take a side in the crackdown in Hong Kong, and internally there is support for the bank's position, with some believing its single biggest advantage is in providing a platform for navigating such geopolitics, and ultimately allowing money to flow across borders regardless of regimes. Rowing back on its international ambitions would also have severe consequences beyond the bank's balance sheet. About 9% of funds linked to global trade run through its infrastructure, and a breakup would add further friction at a time when the world is still recovering from the pandemic, feeling the ripple effects of the war in Ukraine, and wrestling with rising inflation that has put pressure on supply chains. 'HSBC supports customers, corporates and institutions across key capital and trade hubs around the world,' the bank said in a statement. 'This network manifests itself in our leading global franchises across retail, wealth and wholesale banking. The most important thing for management to focus on is continuing to drive higher returns, as we have done very successfully, despite the disruptions of Covid-19.' Geopolitics and trade aside, British politicians also have a financial interest in keeping HSBC together. The Treasury will be acutely aware of the potential losses associated with a breakup: while hiving off HSBC's Asia operations would probably leave the UK retail bank intact, the exchequer's earnings through the UK bank levy would plunge. The banking sector surcharge, first imposed by former chancellor George Osborne in the wake of the financial crisis, taxes UK-headquartered banks on their global balance sheets rather than their local operations, ensuring that global lenders such as Standard Chartered and HSBC contribute more heavily to the British public purse. In 2019, HSBC paid an extra $988m (PS800m) to the Treasury as a result of the bank levy, more than six times the $154m it paid that year in UK corporation tax. The current chancellor, Rishi Sunak, may have been taken that income for granted when he announced plans to slash the bank levy from 8% to 3% from 2023. The Treasury declined to comment, saying any decision was a commercial matter for HSBC. However, it is the UK's grip on HSBC's finances that seems to have fuelled Ping An's calls for a split. Ping An - which is China's most valuable publicly listed insurer - first declared a 5% stake in the lender in December 2017, at a time when HSBC's shares were trading at 706p on average, and the bank was paying 51 cents a share in dividends. The investment was strategic for Ping An, which took on the shareholding through a life insurance arm that relies on dividend income to offset long-term liabilities. But by 2020, the world had changed. With regulators fearing the worst in the early days of the pandemic, UK banks reached an agreement with the Bank of England to scrap nearly PS8bn in dividends, ensuring that lenders had a strong enough capital cushion for whatever economic blows might ensue. The announcement, which meant HSBC would have to backtrack on promises to pay $4.2bn to shareholders, disturbed investors and reignited debates about HSBC's structure: a less lucrative European jurisdiction had been able to dictate major financial decisions to a bank that drew about two-thirds of its profits from a different continent entirely. But Ping An hung on. In September 2020, it gave HSBC a vote of confidence when it raised its stake to 8% and become its largest shareholder - right in the middle of the political row over the bank's support for China's controversial security law being extended to Hong Kong. The resulting calm was shortlived. Ping An faced further frustration when HSBC reinstated its dividend at just half the previous rate after the Bank of England lifted restrictions last year. HSBC executives met their largest shareholder regularly in the months that followed, though discussions turned tense at the turn of the new year. It is understood that they felt blindsided by Ping An's call for a breakup, having never been given official notice that the investor was calling for an outright split. It has been suggested that Ping An's decision to air its grievances via the press is a result of pressures over its own faltering fortunes. On the same day its breakup demands went public, it reported a 24% drop in first-quarter profits to 20.6bn yuan (PS2.5bn), which it blamed on market volatility. It also warned that the ongoing effects of the pandemic were creating a more 'complex, severe, and uncertain' environment for its global business. Some have also speculated that the insurance arm may be considering selling its stake in HSBC to release some cash and find a more lucrative home for its investment. In the meantime, HSBC's executives are expected to hold their ground when they speak with the insurer later this month. HSBC said: 'We believe we've got the right strategy and are focused on executing it. Delivering on this strategy is the fastest way to generate higher returns and maximise shareholder value.' Yet while Tucker may be able to douse this fire, the debate over HSBC's future is not going away.", "d9cc32cedadb3f2d9c2abb5b81c42a3683e0c0d8ac547752f1a9b769": "At least 26 people have been killed and a further 74 have been treated in hospital after a powerful explosion tore the facade from a hotel in the Cuban capital, sending plumes of dust into the air and leaving rubble strewn across the street in the historic centre of Havana. Speaking at the scene soon afterwards, the Cuban president, Miguel Diaz-Canel, ruled out a bomb and said the blast at the Hotel Saratoga appeared to have been caused by a gas leak. 'In no case was it a bomb or an attack,' he later told Reuters as he left the capital's Calixto Garcia hospital, where many of the injured were treated. 'It's just a very unfortunate accident.' The hotel was closed to tourists at the time of the explosion, but workers were inside. State TV reported search and rescue efforts were ongoing and said it was unclear whether additional victims remained trapped in the rubble. Photos published by government news media showed much of the hotel's outer wall blown away, exposing interior rooms, with clouds of dust billowing into the sky. Roberto Enrique Calzadilla, a representative of the military-run company that operates many of the country's hotels, said the 96-room hotel had been set to reopen in the next few days and that the workers on site were making final preparations. 'The workers were ... making repairs and doing all the work to open the property and in the morning they were resupplying the gas and it seems some accident caused an explosion,' he said on state television. Police and rescue workers flocked to the scene, cordoning off areas and buildings nearby, including the Capitolio building. Windows in the surrounding streets were blown out by the force of the explosion, and two hours after the explosion, an acrid smell lingered in the air. 'I was walking past when everything went white and I couldn't see anything,' said one woman who lives just a block from the hotel. Habaneros living in the colonial part of the city are accustomed to the sudden collapse of once-elegant buildings, which are often home to dozens of families but have received little maintenance for decades. But the thunderous noise the explosion made was something different: within 15 minutes of the explosion, more than 10,000 people had congregated outside the rubble-strewn structure, taking pictures and uploading videos. Yazira de la Caridad, mother of two, told AP that the explosion shook her home a block from the hotel. 'The whole building moved. I thought it was an earthquake,' she said. 'I've still got my heart in my hand.' The disaster was yet another blow to the island's struggling tourism industry, which the government relies on for hard currency but has been devastated by the coronavirus pandemic and tighter US sanctions. 'It means that less tourists will come because of fear,' said Jiskli Aguila, 51, who works in a furniture factory, and was watching TV two blocks away when the explosion happened. 'And with the problems in the economy and the state of the country - it's just one thing after another.' The 96-room neo-classical-style hotel was remodeled by a British company after the fall of the Soviet Union and was considered the place to go for visiting government officials and celebrities for many years. Madonna and Beyonce have both stayed at the five-star hotel, although recently it had lost some of its shine with the opening of new hotels in Havana. The hotel had been set for a post-pandemic reopening in four days, according to its Facebook page.", "0b6b2811398f7630bc7c4b5b955e6b62b77c699e261da8629a363e6a": "In the half light of the approaching sunrise at Maroubra in Sydney's south-east, Joshua Hay clambers over rock ledges, feeling his way to the ocean's edge. Armed with his 1970s vintage rod, reel and bucket, he's aiming to catch luderick at 'the Stake', a popular but dangerous spot among rock fishers. To get to the Stake 'fishos' have to pass a sign reading 'three deaths' underneath a skull and crossbones - the tally of drownings in the area. Rain has been sprinkling down on the coastline overnight, and the rocks are wet and slippery. As Hay digs around for bits of seaweed - his preferred bait - foamy water laps at his ankles. 'You still get those butterflies,' he says with a grin. 'That's why they call it fishing, not catching.' The Stake is in the city of Randwick, where there have been 21 rock fishing fatalities since 2001 - making it the most statistically dangerous area for the sport in Australia. Rock fishing is the second-most common cause of drowning along the New South Wales coastline behind swimming. Despite its dangers, more than 1.2 million Australians go rock fishing every year, including a diverse group of migrants. Lin Yuan learned the art of rock fishing from 'Master Han', an experienced fisher who frequents Bare Island at La Perouse. 'My friend sent me a photo of him, and said, 'that guy always catches good fish',' he says. Nowadays, Yuan, Han and his friend head out when it's still pitch black about 5am, armed with a large net to keep caught fish and squid alive until they assess their haul at the end of the day. The smaller fish, or the less tasty, are returned to the sea. 'Around Sydney, there's not many secret spots anymore ... and you don't want to risk too much danger. It's a hobby, not what you do for a living,' Yuan says with a laugh. Yuan and his mates all wear life jackets and cleats. They have seen the dangers first-hand after watching a fisher get washed away at another La Perouse spot. 'Luckily his friend had a fishing rod, [and] he took off the hooks so they could grab the line and slowly fished him back in,' Yuan says. 'After he got out, everyone was still fishing, even himself.' Joint research by Surf Life Saving Australia and the University of Melbourne found that a misunderstanding of wave patterns among inexperienced fishers has led to the notion of 'freak' wave events. Study author David Kennedy said the notion of 'lone waves ... grabbing people out of nowhere' was a myth. 'Less experienced fishers [surveyed] tended to look closer at the base of where the waves were about to hit,' he said. 'People had seconds, at best, of warning when a wave was coming, whereas more experienced fishers were already looking offshore.' NSW councils have implemented a range of measures to reduce the risk of rock fishing, including mandating life jackets, increasing signage and running educational workshops. Randwick was the first council to make lifejackets compulsory in 2016. But a study released by the council the following year found their use had only slightly increased. Almost half of respondents to a council survey didn't think the use of lifejackets was necessary despite a majority being aware that there was a high death toll in the area. While Kennedy agreed rock fishing was 'inherently dangerous', he said risk would be substantially minimised with greater education and awareness of surroundings. 'You're in a remote environment and that's why people are doing it. You're in nature, and it's recognition [that] nature's boss,' he said. 'The element of danger is part of the excitement. 'Often the decision to go fishing is made when someone leaves home ... Once they've got down there, travelled a long way, it's a bigger call to not fish. People will put themselves into situations they might not have.' Central Coast fisher James Cross says when people tell him rock fishing is dangerous, he replies: 'It is, but no more dangerous than swimming.' This year has already been marred by a number of deaths, including a father and son who were washed off the rocks at Little Bay just down the coast from Maroubra in January. Fishers, including Cross, said La Nina had contributed to unfavourable conditions. Cross uses a canister lifejacket that can be inflated if needed, believing that being a strong swimmer, an inflated jacket may hinder his chances of returning to shore. 'I know a lot of people who've been washed off the rocks and they know a place to swim back in ... I fancy my odds, I wouldn't be out if it was wild,' he says. Cross has been hooked on rock fishing ever since his father-in-law came home with a bag of luderick and drummer for dinner. He has introduced several other people to the sport. 'People have gone, 'where do you keep getting this fish from?' because if I've forgotten a bucket I'll tie a net on the front of the car,' he says. 'It's a good conversation starter.' Cross gravitated to rock fishing for several reasons: foraging, environmental preservation and the adrenaline rush that comes with an unexpected catch. Then there's the 'therapeutic, meditative qualities of it'. 'One of the best times is the morning,' he says. 'You get up with head torches, watch the sun rise over the ocean ... Combine that with a sport you love, you're getting a bite and then you come home and have a coffee and breakfast and feel like the day is just starting.' Plus, the members of the community have each other's back. That's what Cross loves most. 'Going out and having a chat with the boys on the rocks ... You can sit down with someone you'd never have talked to and have a good yarn about the fish that got away,' he says. 'It brings out the best in people.' For Hay, fishing isn't just a hobby - it's in his bloodline. 'I've fished my whole life, my grandfather fished, my dad fished,' he says. 'There've been days with three of us when we've caught 30 fish in three hours, but some of the days I like most, I've gone way out, found a new ledge in the middle of nowhere, no one else is there, and I've caught fish. 'Or days fish are really hard to catch. You try two, three hours, and finally catch one. It's as satisfying as catching 10.'", "2fb3bbfd916cabd9d8cd8ace585103d6035d95e420cca6c610b3d26f": "", "cbf2b7fc176534a141b75e9c2f214c1996d3252eed44c035214f34f9": "", "bd3b98a9fc5c89e5e5036fe1e0b346d242cff6d8465472f98214e17e": "", "4d6a09848abaeb435310c9fcbb39fc5a0d81b49fe670a8f721f63e6e": "", "2c735449f436e4ca70a67967fc6832df14a450be8fbb5869faf19e15": "", "9c23bb7802d6a4a86eb25453dce84f673a90a702f2d662e6208fb464": "", "768e8b27902fef4d72a5187c30506ef0c39da868d1d312ed5ed65c56": "", "06c9b44bd76c6b0e314ab608cde4347e1ff6f83d4fb6fe23417ea290": "", "634a7ba8465ee5e5f738e844d8349ef552ae3b150627e7ab16bed38c": "", "4cc6c3a2a20e4235bcbcac12554c945c4b66adda5d201d55712b5827": "Maggie Mayhem knows when she decided to become a reproductive rights activist. At around 13 she discovered two conditions in her southern California Catholic girls school's manual: If a student was found to have had an abortion, they would be expelled, because abortion was against the teaching of the Catholic church. At the same time, the school would not accommodate a student who became pregnant. 'It taught me my reproductive system was something I should be afraid of, that it could have negative consequences for my life,' Mayhem says. 'I saw: 'there will be no sympathy for you. And anyone that you talk to about this poses a risk.'' She also saw beautiful things: friends helping friends to the abortion clinic. Teenagers taking care of teenagers, keeping grownups at bay. That solidarity led her to her current line of work. Mayhem - a pseudonym - is just one of many US activists vouching for self-managed abortions outside the gaze of the medical establishment. With a growing slate of abortion restrictions and the recent leak of a supreme court draft opinion indicating justices have already voted to overturn the constitutional right to abortion, activists like Mayhem say such measures aren't just necessary, they are also better than what's currently on offer. They are saying: abortion is your right - and you don't need to depend on doctors or the state for it. When most people think of self-managed abortion, they think of back alleys, coat hangers or throwing oneself down the stairs; of last resorts, despair, shame. But that is no longer the reality. Today, self-managed abortion often means taking pills that are available over the counter in many countries, with little risk of death or serious complications. Other times, it means using herbs, or vacuum aspirators, like the Del-Em (a homemade suction device created by activists in the 70s), under the watchful eye of somebody experienced - like a midwife or a doula - who can advise if things go wrong. Self-managed abortion is not a silver bullet. It carries with it the risk of prosecution, even though it is not illegal in most states. In April, a Texas woman was charged with murder for a self-induced abortion, even though there was no legal basis for the charges - as the district attorney admitted when he dropped the case. And not everybody wants to turn to a clandestine market for their abortion care. Some people feel more comfortable with a licensed practitioner. People want options. But for many,  options are fast receding. Those who look outside the medical establishment will find, often through word of mouth, an underground movement of doctors, midwives, doulas and activists - some trained by formal institutions, others by practitioners in the network. They will find those who mostly undertake legal work - sharing information from the World Health Organization about how to use medication to induce an abortion, for example. They'll also find some who do not - assisting with abortions later down the line, or giving medical advice when things go wrong. 'It is not a practitioner's or a government's job to give people power,' says Samantha Zipporah, an educator who refers to herself as a traditional midwife - Zipporah is not credentialed. Zipporah says she rejects state regulation of pregnancy care. To her, home-centered abortion care is far from a last resort or a reaction to a changing policy landscape. It's simply not something that should be dependent on an outside authority.'Throughout history, we have a much greater tradition of our fertility and reproductive capacities being social, spiritual and ecological rather than medical or political,' she explains. 'The medical-industrial paradigm, the church, the state - these institutions are set up in a way that requires obedience and submission,' she says. 'Our power was never theirs. Our bodies have power.' The advent of medication abortion has made the work of these activists easier - because it is easily available. Medication abortion is safer than Tylenol - resulting in a successful termination 99.6% of the time when used appropriately, with less than a 1% risk of complications, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The safety of other means used outside a clinical setting hasn't been sufficiently studied, but broadly speaking, existing data from recent years does not show elevated fatality rates from self-managed abortion. The FDA recently allowed people to receive abortion pills by mail, without needing to first visit a medical facility. But states seeking to restrict abortion have required in-person visits or have banned abortion telehealth services outright. That's just one reason activists want to cut out the middle man. Although the majority of abortions are completed with medication, only 21% of the US public know these pills exist. People can order them online but scam sites are common. So activists use in-person and virtual grassroots networks to share where to buy the pills, how to safely ingest them, what a normal response to them looks like and when to seek help. Crucially, they can explain the legal landscape - after all, if you turn up at the emergency room admitting you tried to cause your own abortion, you could face legal risk. But because medication abortion and complications from it look exactly the same, medically, as a miscarriage - people need not disclose they tried to induce their own abortion. Self-managed abortion can eradicate barriers, even in a world where in-clinic abortions aren't under attack. It offers privacy: the ability to have an abortion at home, away from protesters, or your community. It may offer cover from an abusive partner. And it means that people who live far away from a clinic, or can't afford to make the trip, can still access the procedure. 'It all comes down to someone assessing their own situation, and being able to make a decision about how to manage their reproductive care. There's simply no medical reason that abortion pills shouldn't be over the counter,' says a spokesperson for Mountain Access Brigade, a group that runs an abortion hotline in Appalachia and the south-east. 'To make people jump through these hoops: to go to appointments, to have a mandatory ultrasound - these things are designed to humiliate, shame and coerce them into changing their mind,' she adds. 'These pills are safer than aspirin. They're safer than Viagra. We let people manage very complex conditions at home - such as diabetes. And yet these pills are so restricted,' says reproductive rights activist Susan Yanow. 'People are afraid of them.' Of course, some doctors worry about self-managed abortions. The abortion pill is considered safe only until 10 weeks. People can still use it effectively up to 14 weeks, but the risk of complications goes up. Doctors worry about people estimating the wrong date of conception; that they may still be pregnant after taking the medication without realizing; or they will experience complications and end up in need of urgent help. 'I absolutely worry about people self-managing their abortions,' says Dr Mark Rosing, an obstetrician gynecologist who works in the Bronx, New York. 'A patient could hemorrhage, develop a severe infection and even die,' he adds. Rosing was in training in New York in the early 2000s, when he noticed patients in the emergency room talking about taking a 'star pill' before miscarriage. They were referring to misoprostol, one of the drugs used to induce a medical abortion, which was not widely available for abortion uses then. He presumes many people used the medication successfully and didn't end up in the emergency room. But those who did were panicked, scared of how much they were bleeding and sometimes hadn't successfully evacuated the pregnancy. He understands that in a landscape that looks increasingly likely to overturn the constitutional right to abortion, leading to bans in 26 states, people might not have a choice. 'I wouldn't blame them. People aren't going to stop trying to get what they need,' he says. Rosing was trained by many doctors who practiced before Roe v Wade, the seminal supreme court decision which established the constitutional right to abortion. His mentors and teachers told him about cases involving self-managed abortion, and the gruesome complications which haunted them. 'People came in with perforated uteruses, hemorrhage and severe infections. People lost their uterus and all kinds of things,' he says. 'I'm really afraid we're going back there.' The reality is that self-managed abortions don't look the same now as pre-Roe. There were 19 deaths related to 'illegal' abortions - those not performed by a licensed clinician - in 1973, the year Roe v Wade was decided, according to CDC data. In the last two decades, two people have died from an illegal abortion, while 103 have died from a legal abortion. The comparison is not like-for-like - hundreds of thousands of legal abortions take place every year in the US, whereas the full scale of self-managed abortion is unknown - but the dangers of self-managed abortion may be overstated. 'We are more capable of being able to understand our reproductive selves - and to manage that effectively and safely - than we've been led to believe,' says Vienna Farlow, a holistic healthcare practitioner. 'But the system is set up to say, you're too dumb to do any of this. And not only are you too dumb, your body doesn't matter enough for us to even care to tell you how to do it,' she expands. Activists believe much of the stigma around self-managed abortion was caused, in part, by a campaigning technique by the pro-choice movement - when abortion activists would hand out small coat hangers, defending the right to abortion by evoking images of dangerous procedures that are no longer the norm. 'That may have been very necessary or appropriate for the time, but it increased the fear of abortion and added a lot more abstract ideas of danger rather than demystifying what abortion is,' Mayhem says. Between 2017 and 2020, researchers from the University of California, San Francisco, tried to understand the prevalence, effectiveness and dangers of self-managed abortions - the first ever such study to do so. They asked a random sample of 7,022 women if they had self-managed an abortion in their lifetime and 1.4% responded that they had, leading researchers to predict that something like 7% of all women in the US will self-manage an abortion in their lifetime. The researchers were surprised by the methods women use to induce their own abortions - booze, herbs, pills, even asking a partner to hit them in the abdomen. They thought medication abortion would be more prevalent. These methods were largely ineffective, but also largely not life-threatening. Of 92 participants who said they had tried to manage their own abortions, 27 were effective. Twelve said they experienced complications (defined as something requiring 'treatment by a doctor or nurse'). Nobody experienced severe complications. For one in five participants, not being able to locate an abortion clinic, or having to travel too far to get to one, was the reason the person attempted self-management. Forebodingly, the researchers pointed out: 'Unprecedented levels of new state-level abortion restrictions ... and the potential for a Supreme Court decision that could reshape federal Constitutional protections on abortion, suggest an urgent need to pay close attention to trends in [self-managed abortion] ... in the coming years.' While fears over medical difficulties abound when discussing self-managed abortion, incarceration is the bigger threat in the US. At least 17 people have been arrested in the US for charges connected to self-induced abortion. They include Jennifer Whalen, who served jail time for buying pills online for her 16-year-old daughter to have an abortion, after they couldn't access an appointment at a clinic. Some, like Purvi Patel in Indiana and Regina McKnight in South Carolina, were given decades-long sentences. Both were overturned, but not before each spent years in jail. But what are the risks of not getting an abortion? First, a lot more people will die during childbirth - which is 14 times more deadly than abortion. 'Abortion is a very safe procedure. And in the United States, staying pregnant is relatively deadly, because we have such an abysmal rate of pregnancy-related mortality and morbidity,' explains Dr Amanda Stevenson, who conducted research predicting how many more people will die if Roe v Wade is overturned solely because of the greater mortality risk of continuing a pregnancy. Her study found that, in the event of a nationwide abortion ban, pregnancy-related deaths would increase by 21% within two years. The numbers would be worst for racial minorities. Black people would experience the greatest rate of increase in deaths (33%), followed by Hispanic people (18%). Denying women access to abortion also increases their chances of life-threatening complications, financial hardship and prolonged domestic violence. But if more people know how to manage their own abortions, risks would be reduced, surmises Dr Stevenson. 'If the alternative is self-managed abortion, and that's because clinic-based care isn't accessible, then that's a whole lot safer than staying pregnant,' she says. Another midwife, who supports abortions outside a clinical context, points out the dangers associated with in-clinic abortions. She says she has supported people who have gone for an abortion in-clinic, and then found themselves with complications - like hemorrhage, or incomplete removal - who did not want to go back to the doctor. 'There's so many people that are sent home with pills, without any education about what [their experience should look like],' says the midwife, who did not want to be identified for legal reasons. 'I have supported people who have had incomplete abortions, and needed to go back to the clinic for a repeat suction a number of times, or have had infections and retained tissues, who did not go back to the clinic because the clinic was abusive ... because the clinical care was so impersonal,' she says. As Zipporah puts it, it's not about placing one treatment over the other, it's about giving people a choice. 'I am not demonizing medical care providers or medical care. I don't think that abortion should be only always in the clinic with a doctor or only always at home with a midwife. I believe that people need to have the education and support to do whatever the fuck they want. And to realize that they have options,' says Zipporah.", "fb906ed282d17dd156573d32f722bf2261df6e4e82313fe8846f7722": "Beneath our feet is an ecosystem so astonishing that it tests the limits of our imagination. It's as diverse as a rainforest or a coral reef. We depend on it for 99% of our food, yet we scarcely know it. Soil. Under one square metre of undisturbed ground in the Earth's mid-latitudes (which include the UK) there might live several hundred thousand small animals. Roughly 90% of the species to which they belong have yet to be named. One gram of this soil - less than a teaspoonful - contains around a kilometre of fungal filaments. When I first examined a lump of soil with a powerful lens, I could scarcely believe what I was seeing. As soon as I found the focal length, it burst into life. I immediately saw springtails - tiny animals similar to insects - in dozens of shapes and sizes. Round, crabby mites were everywhere: in some soils there are half a million in every square metre. Then I began to see creatures I had never encountered before. What I took to be a tiny white centipede turned out, when I looked it up, to be a different life form altogether, called a symphylid. I spotted something that might have stepped out of a Japanese anime: long and low, with two fine antennae at the front and two at the back, poised and sprung like a virile dragon or a flying horse. It was a bristletail, or dipluran. As I worked my way through the lump, again and again I found animals whose existence, despite my degree in zoology and a lifetime immersed in natural history, had been unknown to me. After two hours examining a kilogram of soil, I realised I had seen more of the major branches of the animal kingdom than I would on a week's safari in the Serengeti. But even more arresting than soil's diversity and abundance is the question of what it actually is. Most people see it as a dull mass of ground-up rock and dead plants. But it turns out to be a biological structure, built by living creatures to secure their survival, like a wasps' nest or a beaver dam. Microbes make cements out of carbon, with which they stick mineral particles together, creating pores and passages through which water, oxygen and nutrients pass. The tiny clumps they build become the blocks the animals in the soil use to construct bigger labyrinths. Soil is fractally scaled, which means its structure is consistent, regardless of magnification. Bacteria, fungi, plants and soil animals, working unconsciously together, build an immeasurably intricate, endlessly ramifying architecture that, like Dust in a Philip Pullman novel, organises itself spontaneously into coherent worlds. This biological structure helps to explain soil's resistance to droughts and floods: if it were just a heap of matter, it would be swept away. It also reveals why soil can break down so quickly when it's farmed. Under certain conditions, when farmers apply nitrogen fertiliser, the microbes respond by burning through the carbon: in other words, the cement that holds their catacombs together. The pores cave in. The passages collapse. The soil becomes sodden, airless and compacted. But none of the above captures the true wonder of soil. Let's start with something that flips our understanding of how we survive. Plants release into the soil between 11% and 40% of all the sugars they make through photosynthesis. They don't leak them accidentally. They deliberately pump them into the ground. Stranger still, before releasing them, they turn some of these sugars into compounds of tremendous complexity. Making such chemicals requires energy and resources, so this looks like pouring money down the drain. Why do they do it? The answer unlocks the gate to a secret garden. These complex chemicals are pumped into the zone immediately surrounding the plant's roots, which is called the rhizosphere. They are released to create and manage its relationships. Soil is full of bacteria. Its earthy scent is the smell of the compounds they produce. In most corners, most of the time, they wait, in suspended animation, for the messages that will wake them. These messages are the chemicals the plant releases. They are so complex because the plant seeks not to alert bacteria in general, but the particular bacteria that promote its growth. Plants use a sophisticated chemical language that only the microbes to whom they wish to speak can understand. When a plant root pushes into a lump of soil and starts releasing its messages, it triggers an explosion of activity. The bacteria responding to its call consume the sugars the plant feeds them and proliferate to form some of the densest microbial communities on Earth. There can be a billion bacteria in a single gram of the rhizosphere; they unlock the nutrients on which the plant depends and produce growth hormones and other chemicals that help it grow. The plant's vocabulary changes from place to place and time to time, depending on what it needs. If it's starved of certain nutrients, or the soil is too dry or salty, it calls out to the bacteria species that can help. Take a step back and you will see something that transforms our understanding of life on Earth. The rhizosphere lies outside the plant, but it functions as if it were part of the whole. It could be seen as the plant's external gut. The similarities between the rhizosphere and the human gut, where bacteria also live in astonishing numbers, are uncanny. In both systems, microbes break down organic material into the simpler compounds the plant or person can absorb. Though there are more than 1,000 phyla (major groups) of bacteria, the same four dominate both the rhizosphere and the guts of mammals. Just as human breast milk contains sugars called oligosaccharides, whose purpose is to feed not the baby but the bacteria in the baby's gut, young plants release large quantities of sucrose into the soil, to feed and develop their new microbiomes. Just as the bacteria that live in our guts outcompete and attack invading pathogens, the friendly microbes in the rhizosphere create a defensive ring around the root. Just as bacteria in the colon educate our immune cells and send chemical messages that trigger our body's defensive systems, the plant's immune system is trained and primed by bacteria in the rhizosphere. Soil might not be as beautiful to the eye as a rainforest or a coral reef, but once you begin to understand it, it is as beautiful to the mind. Upon this understanding our survival might hang. We face what could be the greatest predicament humankind has ever encountered: feeding the world without devouring the planet. Already, farming is the world's greatest cause of habitat destruction, the greatest cause of the global loss of wildlife and the greatest cause of the global extinction crisis. It's responsible for about 80% of the deforestation that's happened this century. Of 28,000 species known to be at imminent risk of extinction, 24,000 are threatened by farming. Only 29% of the weight of birds on Earth consists of wild species: the rest is poultry. Just 4% of the world's mammals, by weight, are wild; humans account for 36%, and livestock for the remaining 60%. Unless something changes, all this is likely to get worse - much worse. In principle, there is plenty of food, even for a rising population. But roughly half the calories farmers grow are now fed to livestock, and the demand for animal products is rising fast. Without a radical change in the way we eat, by 2050 the world will need to grow around 50% more grain. How could we do it without wiping out much of the rest of life on Earth? Just as farming is trashing crucial Earth systems, their destruction threatens our food supply. Sustaining even current levels of production might prove impossible. Climate breakdown is likely, on the whole, to make wet places wetter and dry places drier. One more degree of heating, one estimate suggests, would parch 32% of the world's land surface. By the middle of this century, severe droughts could simultaneously affect an arc from Portugal to Pakistan. And this is before we consider the rising economic fragility of the global food system, or geopolitical pressures, such as the current war in Ukraine, that might threaten 30% of the world's wheat exports. It's not just the quantity of production that's at risk, but also its quality. A combination of higher temperatures and higher concentrations of CO2 reduces the level of minerals, protein and B vitamins that crops contain. Already, zinc deficiency alone afflicts more than a billion people. Though we seldom discuss it, one paper describes the falling concentrations of nutrients as 'existential threats'. Some crop scientists believe we can counter these trends by raising yields in places that remain productive. But their hopes rely on unrealistic assumptions. The most important of these is sufficient water. The anticipated growth in crop yields would require 146% more fresh water than is used today. Just one problem: that water doesn't exist. Over the past 100 years, our use of water has increased six-fold. Irrigating crops consumes 70% of the water we withdraw from rivers, lakes and aquifers. Already, 4 billion people suffer from water scarcity for at least one month a year and 33 major cities, including Sao Paulo, Cape Town, Los Angeles and Chennai, are threatened by extreme water stress. As groundwater is depleted, farmers have begun to rely more heavily on meltwater from glaciers and snowpacks. But these, too, are shrinking. A likely flashpoint is the valley of the Indus, whose water is used by three nuclear powers (India, Pakistan and China) and several unstable regions. Already, 95% of the river's flow is extracted. As the economy and the population grow, by 2025 demand for water in the catchment is expected to be 44% greater than supply. But one of the reasons why farming there has been able to intensify and cities to grow is that, as a result of global heating, glaciers in the Hindu Kush and the Himalayas have been melting faster than they've been accumulating, so more water has been flowing down the rivers. This can't last. By the end of the century, between one- and two-thirds of the ice mass is likely to have disappeared. It is hard to see this ending well. And all this is before we come to the soil, the thin cushion between rock and air on which human life depends, which we treat like dirt. While there are international treaties on telecommunication, civil aviation, investment guarantees, intellectual property, psychotropic substances and doping in sport, there is no global treaty on soil. The notion that this complex and scarcely understood system can withstand all we throw at it and continue to support us could be the most dangerous of all our beliefs. Soil degradation is bad enough in rich nations, where the ground is often left bare and exposed to winter rain, compacted and wrecked by overfertilisation and pesticides that rip through its foodwebs. But it tends to be even worse in poorer nations, partly because extreme rainfall, cyclones and hurricanes can tear bare earth from the land, and partly because hungry people are often driven to cultivate steep slopes. In some countries, mostly in Central America, tropical Africa and south-east Asia, more than 70% of the arable land is now suffering severe erosion, gravely threatening future production. Climate breakdown, which will cause more intense droughts and storms, exacerbates the threat. The loss of a soil's resilience can happen incrementally and subtly. We might scarcely detect it until a shock pushes the complex underground system past its tipping point. When severe drought strikes, the erosion rate of degraded soil can rise 6,000-fold. In other words, the soil collapses. Fertile lands turn to dustbowls. Some people have responded to these threats by calling for the relocalisation and de-intensification of farming. I understand their concerns. But their vision is mathematically impossible. A study in the journal Nature Food found the average minimum distance at which the world's people can be fed is 2,200km. In other words, this is the shortest possible average journey that our food must travel if we are not to starve. For those who depend on wheat and similar cereals, it's 3,800km. A quarter of the global population that consumes these crops needs food grown at least 5,200km away. Why? Because most of the world's people live in big cities or populous valleys, whose hinterland is too small (and often too dry, hot or cold) to feed them. Much of the world's food has to be grown in vast, lightly habited lands - the Canadian prairies, the US plains, wide tracts in Russia and Ukraine, the Brazilian interior - and shipped to tight, densely populated places.  As for reducing the intensity of farming, what this means is using more land to produce the same amount of food. Land use is arguably the most important of all environmental issues. The more land farming occupies, the less is available for forests and wetlands, savannahs and wild grasslands, and the greater is the loss of wildlife and the rate of extinction. All farming, however kind and careful, involves a radical simplification of natural ecosystems. Environmental campaigners rail against urban sprawl: the profligate use of land for housing and infrastructure. But agricultural sprawl - using large amounts of land to produce small amounts of food - has transformed much greater areas. While 1% of the world's land is used for buildings and infrastructure, crops occupy 12% and grazing, the most extensive kind of farming, uses 28%. Only 15% of land, by contrast, is protected for nature. Yet the meat and milk from animals that rely solely on grazing provide just 1% of the world's protein. One paper looked at what would happen if everyone in the US followed the advice of celebrity chefs and switched from grain-fed to pasture-fed beef. It found that, because they grow more slowly on grass, the number of cattle would have to rise by 30%, while the land area used to feed them would rise by 270%. Even if the US felled all its forests, drained its wetlands, watered its deserts and annulled its national parks, it would still need to import most of its beef. Already, much of the beef the US buys comes from Brazil, which in 2018 became the world's largest exporter. This meat is often promoted as 'pasture-fed'. Many of the pastures were created by illegally clearing the rainforest. Worldwide, meat production could destroy 3m sq km of highly biodiverse places in 35 years. That's almost the size of India. Only when livestock are extremely sparse is animal farming compatible with rich, functional ecosystems. For example, the Knepp Wildland project in West Sussex, where small herds of cattle and pigs roam freely across a large estate, is often cited as a way to reconcile meat and wildlife. But while it's an excellent example of rewilding, it's a terrible example of food production. If this system were to be rolled out across 10% of the UK's farmland and if, as its champions propose, we obtained our meat this way, it would furnish each person here with 420 grams of meat a year, enough for around three meals. We could eat a prime steak roughly once every three years. If all the farmland in the UK were to be managed this way, it would provide us with 75kcal a day (one 30th of our requirement) in meat, and nothing else. Of course, this is not how it would be distributed. The very rich would eat meat every week, other people not at all. Those who say we should buy only meat like this, who often use the slogan 'less and better', present an exclusive product as if it were available to everyone. Campaigners, chefs and food writers rail against intensive farming and the harm it does to us and the world. But the problem is not the adjective: it's the noun. The destruction of Earth systems is caused not by intensive farming or extensive farming, but a disastrous combination of the two. So what can we do? Part of the answer is to take as much food production out of farming as we can. As luck would have it, the enabling technology has arrived just as we need it. Precision fermentation, producing protein and fat in breweries from soil bacteria, fed on water, hydrogen, CO2 and minerals, has the potential to replace all livestock farming, all soya farming and plenty of vegetable oil production, while massively reducing land use and other environmental impacts. But this remarkable good fortune is threatened by intellectual property rights: it could easily be captured by the same corporations that now monopolise the global grain and meat trade. We should fiercely resist this: patents should be weak and anti-trust laws strong. Ideally, this farm-free food should be open source. Then we could relocalise production: the new fermentation technologies could be used by local businesses to serve local markets. As some of the world's poorest nations are rich in sunlight, they could make good use of a technology that relies on green hydrogen. Microbial production horrifies some of those who demand food sovereignty and food justice. But it could deliver both more effectively than farming does. Such technologies grant us, for the first time since the Neolithic period, the opportunity to transform not only our food system but our entire relationship with the living world. Vast tracts of land can be released from both intensive and extensive farming. The age of extinction could be replaced by an age of regenesis. Of course, we would still need to produce cereals, roots, fruit and vegetables. So how do we do it safely and productively? The answer might lie in our new understanding of the soil. On a farm in south Oxfordshire, techniques developed by a vegetable grower called Iain Tolhurst - Tolly - seem to have anticipated recent discoveries by soil scientists. Tolly is a big, tough-looking man in his late 60s, with etched and weathered skin, a broad, heavy jaw, long blond hair, one gold earring, hands grained with earth and oil. He started farming without training or instruction, without land or any means to buy it. After a string of misadventures, he managed to lease seven hectares (17.3 acres) of very poor land at a reduced rent, 34 years ago. 'No conventional grower would even look at this ground,' he told me. 'It's 40% stone. They'd call it building rubble. It isn't even classed as arable: an agronomist would say it's only good for grass or trees. But over the past 12 months, we harvested 120 tonnes of vegetables and fruit.' Astonishingly, for these 34 years Tolly has been farming this rubble without pesticides, herbicides, mineral treatments, animal manure or any other kind of fertiliser. He has pioneered a way of growing that he calls 'stockfree organic'. This means he uses no livestock or livestock products at any point in the farming cycle, yet he also uses no artificial inputs. Until he proved the model, this was thought to be a formula for sucking the fertility out of the land. Vegetables in particular are considered hungry crops, which require plenty of extra nutrients to grow. Yet Tolly, while adding none, has raised his yields until they've hit the lower bound of what intensive growers achieve with artificial fertilisers on good land: a feat widely considered impossible. Remarkably, the fertility of his soil has climbed steadily. On my first visit, one June, I was struck by the great range and health of Tolly's crops. One plot was a blue haze of onion plants, another a patchwork of sea greens: young cauliflower plants, several kinds of cabbage and kale. There were rows of rainbow chard with gold, green, white and crimson stems. Broad bean pods had begun to sprout from tight pillars of flower. His potatoes were in full bloom, nightshade sinister, stamens like yellow stings. Courgettes extruded rudely behind their trumpet flowers. There were carrots, tomatoes, peppers, beans of all kinds, herbs, parsnips, celeriac, cucumbers, lettuces. He raises 100 varieties of vegetables, which he sells in his farm shop and to subscribers to his veg box. Separating the plots were untended banks, in which scientists studying his farm have found 75 species of wildflowers. These banks are an essential component of his system, harbouring the insect predators that control crop pests. Though he uses no pesticides, none of the vegetable plants I saw showed signs of significant insect damage: the leaves were dark and wide, with scarcely a hole or a spot. Almost single-handedly, through trial and error, Tolly has developed a new and revolutionary model of horticulture. At first it looks like magic. In reality, it's the result of many years of meticulous experiments. Two of his innovations appear to be crucial. The first, as he puts it, is to 'make the system watertight': preventing rain from washing through the soil, taking the nutrients with it. What this means is ensuring the land is almost never left bare. Beneath his vegetables grows an understorey of 'green manure', plants that cover the soil. Under the leaves of his pumpkins, I could see thousands of tiny seedlings: the 'weeds' he had deliberately sown. When the crops are harvested, the green manure fills the gap and soon becomes a thicket of colour: blue chicory flowers, crimson clover, yellow melilot and trefoil, mauve Phacelia, pink sainfoin. 'There's green manure under the green manure,' Tolly told me. 'As soon as we cut the bigger plants, it comes into flower, and the bees go crazy.' Some of the plants in his mix put down deep roots that draw nutrients from the subsoil. Every so often, Tolly runs a mower over them, chopping them into a coarse straw. Earthworms pull this down and incorporate it into the ground. 'The idea is to let the plants put back at least as much carbon and minerals as we take out.' Tolly tells me that 'the green manure ties up nutrients, fixes nitrogen, adds carbon and enhances the diversity of the soil. The more plant species you sow, the more bacteria and fungi you encourage. Every plant has its own associations. Roots are the glue that holds and builds the soil biology.' The other crucial innovation is to scatter over the green manure an average of one millimetre a year of chipped and composted wood, produced from his own trees or delivered by a local tree surgeon. This tiny amendment appears to make a massive difference. In the five years after he started adding woodchip, his yields roughly doubled. As Tolly explains: 'It isn't fertiliser; it's an inoculant that stimulates microbes. The carbon in the wood encourages the bacteria and fungi that bring the soil back to life.' Tolly believes he's adding enough carbon to help the microbes build the soil, but not so much that they lock up nitrogen, which is what happens if you give them more than they need. What Tolly appears to be doing is strengthening and diversifying the relationships in the rhizosphere - the plant's external gut. By keeping roots in the soil, raising the number of plant species and adding just the right amount of carbon, he seems to have encouraged bacteria to build their catacombs in his stony ground, improving the soil's structure and helping his plants to grow. Tolly's success forces us to consider what fertility means. It's not just about the amount of nutrients the soil contains. It's also a function of whether they're available to plants at the right moments, and safely immobilised when plants don't need them. In a healthy soil, crops can regulate their relationships with bacteria in the rhizosphere, ensuring that nutrients are unlocked only when they're required. In other words, fertility is a property of a functioning ecosystem. Farm science has devoted plenty of attention to soil chemistry. But the more we understand, the more important the biology appears to be. Can Tolly's system be replicated? So far the results are inconclusive. But if we can discover how to mediate and enhance the relationship between crop plants and bacteria and fungi in a wide range of soils and climates, it should be possible to raise yields while reducing inputs. Our growing understanding of soil ecology could catalyse a greener revolution. I believe we could combine this approach with another suite of innovations, by a non-profit organisation in Salina, Kansas, called the Land Institute. It's seeking to develop perennial grain crops to replace the annual plants from which we obtain the great majority of our food. Annuals are plants that die after a single growing season. Perennials survive from one year to the next. Large areas dominated by annuals are rare in nature. They tend to colonise ground in the wake of catastrophe: a fire, flood, landslide or volcanic eruption that exposes bare rock or soil. In cultivating annuals, we must keep the land in a catastrophic state. If we grew perennial grain crops, we would be less reliant on smashing living systems apart to produce our food. For 40 years, the Land Institute has been scouring the world for perennial species that could replace the annuals we grow. Already, working with Fengyi Hu and his team at Yunnan University in China, it has developed a perennial rice with yields that match, and in some cases exceed, those of modern annual breeds. Farmers are queueing up for seed. While annual rice farming can cause devastating erosion, the long roots of the perennial varieties bind and protect the soil. Some perennial rice crops have now been harvested six times without replanting. Perennials are their own green manures. The longer they grow, the stronger their relationships with microbes that fix nitrogen from the air and release other minerals. One estimate suggests that perennial systems hold five times as much of the water that falls on the ground as annual crops do. The Land Institute is developing promising lines of perennial wheat, oil crops and other grains. The deep roots and tough structures of perennial plants could help them to withstand climate chaos. The perennial sunflowers the institute is breeding have sailed through two severe droughts, one of which entirely destroyed the annual sunflowers grown alongside them. While no solution is a panacea, I believe that some of the components of a new global food system - one that is more resilient, more distributed, more diverse and more sustainable - are falling into place. If it happens, it will be built on our new knowledge of the most neglected of major ecosystems: the soil. It could resolve the greatest of all dilemmas: how to feed ourselves without destroying the living systems on which we depend. The future is underground.

Two stories surfaced in as many days in the American press this week, citing unnamed officials as saying that US intelligence was instrumental in the targeting of Russian generals on the battlefield and in the sinking of the Moskva flagship cruiser on the Black Sea. The initial report in the New York Times on Wednesday about the generals was partially denied by the White House, which said that while the US shares intelligence with Ukrainian forces, it was not specifically shared with the intent to kill Russian general officers. The next day, NBC, the New York Times and the Washington Post all quoted officials as saying that US intelligence had helped Ukraine hit the Moskva with anti-ship missiles last month, making it the biggest Russian ship to be sunk since the second world war. As a general rule, espionage is carried out in secret, though western intelligence agencies have turned that rule on its head over the past few months by going public with what they knew about Russian preparations for invasion, and then with daily reports on the battlefield and from behind Russian lines. The new disclosures are different however, as they concern what the US espionage agencies themselves have been doing, rather than commenting on the state of the war. In both cases, the US was claiming a hand in historic humiliations for Moscow and for Vladimir Putin, triggering warnings of unintended consequences. Paul Pillar, a former senior CIA official, said: 'My personal view is it's unwise. I am surprised at the extent of official confirmation of the role of US intelligence in the sinking of the Moskva, and even more so the killing of the generals. 'The big concern is that this sort of public confirmation of this extensive US role in the setbacks dealt to the Russians may provoke Putin into escalation in a way that he might not otherwise feel it necessary to escalate.' John Sipher, who served for 28 years in the CIA's clandestine service, some of that time in Moscow, thought the decision to disclose details of intelligence sharing was misguided, but for different reasons. 'I just think it's disrespectful to the Ukrainians,' Sipher said. 'It's taking away from the people who are actually on the ground, who are taking advantage of the intelligence, who are collecting their own intelligence, who are fighting day and night.' However, he did not think that it significantly raised the risk of escalation between Russia and Nato. 'Putin understands how the game is played. He gets intelligence to try to kill Americans if the situation is reversed, as he did in Afghanistan and other places. The Russians have spent years attacking us with cyber warfare and disinformation,' Sipher said. 'So I don't think them being upset that America is sharing intelligence is a game-changer.' European officials made clear their own intelligence agencies would not be following the US lead. 'It's stupid,' one official said. 'I don't think it is a carefully coordinated leak.' An official from another European country cast doubt on the centrality of US intelligence to the Ukrainian targeting of Russian generals, saying the main factor was the predictability of Russian officers as they followed rigid Soviet-era doctrine. The breakdown in their secure communications equipment and the top-down hierarchy of the Russian army meant the top officers had to travel to the frontlines to be sure their orders were carried out and Ukrainian snipers were waiting for them. In the case of the Moskva, US officials were at pains to emphasise that Ukraine made its own targeting decisions, and drew information from multiple sources. 'We are not the only sole source of intelligence and information to the Ukrainians. They get intelligence from other nations as well and have a pretty robust intelligence collection capability,' John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said. 'They've been fighting this war against Russia for eight years. It's not like they are completely blind to the way Russia organises itself and the way Russia conducts itself on the battlefield.'", "2302ed9296dbb0866d75c839dc3f625a735a68b9b181e7c6b4f8332c": "", "b2f8a1ce441126d55a35f34c237a35278a00d3a8694c2c54ed2443bd": "All women, children and elderly people have been evacuated from Mariupol's besieged steel plant, Ukraine's deputy prime minister has said.  Iryna Vereshchuk said the current state of the humanitarian operation in Azovstal has been completed.  'This part of the Mariupol humanitarian operation is over,' she wrote on Telegram on Saturday.  It comes after Ukraine announced an evacuation plan for the plant and other parts of the city on Friday. Earlier, Russian-backed separatists in the Donetsk region said that 50 civilians had been evacuated.  This blog is now closed. Thanks for reading. Our live coverage of the war in Ukraine will resume in a few hours. In the meantime you can read all our Ukraine news and analysis here, and this is our latest news story taking in all the main developments: The time in Kyiv is now 2am. Here are the latest developments from today: That's it from me for today. Handing over now to my colleagues in Australia. Thanks for reading. The director of the Central Intelligence Agency, William Burns, said Russia's setbacks in Ukraine may be impacting China's calculus about trying to gain control over Taiwan. Speaking today at a Washington event hosted by the Financial Times, Burns said China was alarmed by 'the fact that what Putin has done is driving Europeans and Americans closer together' and was looking 'carefully at what lessons they should draw' for Taiwan. Burns added: But while the international outcry over the invasion of Ukraine may be impacting China's thinking about Taiwan, Burns said he did not believe the war had 'eroded Xi's determination over time to gain control over Taiwan'. Emma Graham-Harrison and Vera Mironova report from Kyiv on the paramilitary unit assisting the city's strained police force: The call came around midnight. There was a suspicious man poking around a rundown complex of garages and workshops, police had heard a gunshot and so they wanted backup. The men of the Maidan group rolled out of the bodyshop that served as their headquarters, into a couple of vans with personalised Maidan numberplates and their own ambulance, and set off into the eerie quiet of curfew-hours Kyiv. Far from the frontlines, the war is straining society. There has been extraordinary solidarity across Ukraine, with ordinary people risking, and often giving, their lives to help others simply make it through the day, taking food and fuel to vulnerable and elderly people, or driving evacuation vehicles to pick up those stranded at the frontline. But a minority have taken advantage of the chaos of fighting, the flight of many neighbours into exile, and authorities distracted by an existential threat. In over two months since the first missiles hit Kyiv, Maidan patrols have picked up opportunists on looting raids, desperate residents driven to steal as the economy collapsed, and Russian spies trying to scope potential targets, gather information or just prepare for orders to come.  Britain has pledged to provide another PS1.3bn ($1.6bn) in military support and aid to Ukraine, Reuters reports. The news comes one day before G7 leaders are scheduled to participate in a video call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, as Russia prepares to hold its 9 May Victory Day celebrations. The new funds will almost double Britain's previous spending commitments to Ukraine, as the country tries to push back against the Russian military's attacks.  Boris Johnson's government has already sent anti-tank missiles, air defence systems and other weapons to Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion in February.  Johnson's office said he also plans to meet with executives from leading defence companies later this month to discuss increasing production in response to the war in Ukraine. Johnson, who visited Ukraine last week and became the first western leader to address its parliament since the start of the invasion, said in a statement: Berlin authorities said investigators are studying a device found and destroyed at a residential building housing Russian news agency staff in the city, Reuters reports. A Berlin police spokesman said the device was found on Friday, and an investigation is now underway to determine how dangerous the device was and who it may have been targeting. Russia's foreign ministry has called on European countries to take steps to protect Russian journalists and their families abroad during the war in Ukraine. In a statement released on Saturday, the ministry said of the incident in Berlin: The EU has already banned the state-controlled Russian outlets RT and Sputnik, accusing them of spreading misinformation and Kremlin propaganda about the war. 'Holding up', wrote Denys Prokopenko, commander of Ukraine's Azov regiment, in his latest WhatsApp message to his wife Kateryna from the besieged Azovstal steelworks in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. Speaking via Zoom from Krakow, in eastern Poland, alongside three fellow wives and partners of soldiers living under the remorseless Russian shelling and infiltrating raids, Kateryna, 27, says she is doing everything she can think of to ensure the message at 10pm on Friday evening is not one of her husband's last. It is now two weeks since the last Ukrainian defenders of the flattened city of Mariupol, in south-east Ukraine, withdrew to the sprawling complex of hot and fetid tunnels, along with thousands of terrified civilians, including children. Ukrainian deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on Saturday that all women, children and older adults had been evacuated. For the 2,000 soldiers, 700 of whom are said to be injured, hope, however, is quickly dwindling, as has become cruelly clear from the irregular messages coming out of the works. 'The last message was yesterday,' Kateryna says of the text from her 30-year-old husband. I said 'Hold up, we will do everything in our power to save you.'' Jill Biden expressed gratitude to the first lady of Romania, Carmen Johannis, for hosting her today at a public school that Ukrainian refugee children have started attending after fleeing their country. 'To my fellow teacher and First Lady, thank you for an afternoon in Romania full of compassion and hope,' Biden said on Twitter. 'Not only do we share a love for our students, but we stand united in our support for the Ukrainian people.' The American first lady is currently on a four-day trip to Romania and Slovakia, which is meant to show US support for Ukrainian refugees. On Sunday, which is Mother's Day in the US, Biden will travel to the Slovakia-Ukraine border to meet with Ukrainian mothers and children who were forced to leave their country after the Russian invasion. The director of the Central Intelligence Agency, William Burns, was asked about the fears of Vladimir Putin using a nuclear weapon in frustration, as the Russian military has suffered setbacks in Ukraine. Burns said today at a Washington event organised by the Financial Times: Celebrity chef Jose Andres said his organization, World Central Kitchen, has opened a new warehouse in Dnipro to help feed families affected by the war in Ukraine. Andres' team is compiling 15 kilo food bundles for families to cook with and distributing the packages across the region, particularly to areas near the frontlines where it is more difficult to access food. Since the start of the Russian invasion in February, Dnipro has become 'a logistical hub for humanitarian aid and a reception point for people fleeing the war in the Donbas and other parts of the country', NPR wrote in March. Michael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia under Barack Obama, has called on diplomats in Moscow to avoid the country's 9 May Victory Day celebrations. McFaul said any ambassador who opposes 'annexation, imperialism, and Putin's horrific, unjustified invasion of Ukraine' should not attend the parade on Red Square planned for Monday. McFaul's message comes as Russia tries to take the last stronghold in Mariupol, the besieged steel plant, in time for the 9 May celebrations. The Guardian's Moscow correspondent, Andrew Roth, wrote about how Putin faces an array of dangerous options in Ukraine as Victory Day approaches: Now that all women and children have been evacuated from Mariupol's besieged steel plant, attention has turned to the Ukrainian fighters still trying to defend the site. Hundreds of soldiers remain at the plant, and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Friday that his government was working on a diplomatic effort to save those still there. The fighters have insisted they will not surrender, but officials fear they will come under increased attack in the coming days as Russia tries to take the last remaining Mariupol stronghold in time for the country's 9 May Victory Day celebrations. The wives of at least two Ukrainian fighters still at the plant have been in Rome, begging for the international community to rescue the trapped soldiers. One of the wives, Kateryna Prokopenko, told the Associated Press on Thursday:  Observer columnist Nick Cohen argues that Rupert Murdoch should face sanctions over Fox News' promotion of Russian propaganda: If the west could find the courage, it would order an immediate freeze of Rupert Murdoch's assets. His Fox News presenters and Russia's propagandists are so intermeshed that separating the two is as impossible as unbaking a cake. On Russian state news, as on Fox, bawling ideologues scream threats then whine about their victimhood as they incite anger and self-pity in equal measures. Its arguments range from the appropriation of anti-fascism by Greater Russian imperialists - the 40 countries supporting Ukraine were 'today's collective Hitler', viewers were told last week - to the apocalyptic delirium of the boss of RT (Russia Today) Margarita Simonyan. Nuclear war is my 'horror', she shuddered, 'but we will go to heaven, while they will simply croak'. Russia would never give genuine western journalists airtime. But it can always find a slot for its favourite quisling: Fox News's Tucker Carlson. He pushes out Russian propaganda lines or perhaps creates his own lies for Russia to use. Ukraine, not Russia, is the real tyranny. Nato provoked poor Vladimir Putin. The west is plotting to use biological weapons. Murdoch is boosting Russian morale and, conversely, undermining Ukrainian resolve by supplying a dictatorship with foreign validation. Do not underestimate its importance. During the World Health Organization press conference in Kyiv today, officials indicated they are gathering evidence for potential war crimes committed by Russia, Reuters reports.  The WHO emergencies director, Mike Ryan, said the agency has already documented 200 attacks on hospitals and clinics in Ukraine, which could violate international law. Ryan said: Russia has denied past accusations of committing war crimes or targeting civilians in Ukraine, but those denials have been met with increasing scepticism from western officials. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Thursday that Russian troops have already destroyed or damaged nearly 400 healthcare institutions in the country. The speaker of the US House, Nancy Pelosi, was asked about the request from Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, for the Biden administration to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terror. Appearing on the network MSNBC yesterday, Pelosi said: Pelosi, a Democrat, also discussed her recent trip to Ukraine, where she met Zelenskiy: On the brink of its May 9 Victory Day celebrations, Russia looks very far from triumph in its war in Ukraine. And all of its options going forward are fraught with danger. After a disastrous assault on Kyiv, Russia is engaged in an attempt to take territory in Ukraine's east, as its military nears exhaustion and sanctions continue to escalate. 'With the current force that they have, the push that they're attempting now is all that they have left,' said Jeffrey Edmonds, former director for Russia on the US national security council and senior analyst at the CNA thinktank. 'Militaries just don't recover that quickly from such a devastating loss. And given how effective the Ukrainians have been with our support, I just don't think they're going to be able to achieve their objectives within the coming weeks. And the coming weeks are going to be the telltale of where this is going.' Facing setbacks, officials have suggested that Vladimir Putin may use the May 9 holiday to repackage the war in Ukraine. Dramatic options include escalation through a formal declaration of war or general mobilisation - or de-escalating by proclaiming victory. The director general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, sent a message of solidarity with the Ukrainian people as they confront Russia's attacks. Speaking from the government media center in Kyiv today, Tedros said: The WHO emergencies director, Mike Ryan, said that the organisation has documented 200 attacks on healthcare facilities in Ukraine and would share its findings with those investigating potential crimes committed in the war. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he spoke to his counterpart in Angola about how the war against Russia is affecting global food security. Kuleba said on Twitter that he and Tete Antonio discussed 'steps to develop trade' and 'the need to fully unblock Ukraine's food exports'. The Global Network Against Food Crises, an agency set up by the United Nations and the EU, issued a report on Tuesday warning that the war in Ukraine could exacerbate food insecurity around the world. Countries that already face high levels of food insecurity - such as Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Somalia and Yemen - could be put in even more danger if the war drags on, considering many countries import wheat from Russia and Ukraine. The report said: The director of the Central Intelligence Agency, William Burns, has warned that Vladimir Putin is 'doubling down' on the war in Ukraine, despite the global condemnation he has faced. Speaking at a Financial Times event in Washington, Burns said: Burns also expressed concern that the recent reports about the intelligence that the US has shared with Ukraine are 'irresponsible' and 'very risky,' as they could further enflame tensions with Russia.", "b0cc68ad5e39b2e454ba60518dbd1aefdd5b4d51ff1e759d73131c40": "'They were tears of happiness at first,' says 23-year-old Oksana Balandina of her first dance with her new husband, captured on video by a nurse and now shared across the world. Six weeks ago, Oksana stood on a mine as she was returning home with her then partner, Viktor Vasyliv, also 23, after venturing out to collect some supplies for elderly neighbours on their street in Lysychansk, an east Ukrainian town on the frontline of the war with Russia. Oksana, a paediatric nurse, and mother of Diana, 5, and Illia, 7, was, according to medics, fortunate to survive the blast, but she lost both her legs and four fingers on her left hand. Since then she has had moments of utter despair, screaming out that she wants to die, says Viktor, a carpenter, as he crouches by her wheelchair. Today, however, drinking a takeaway coffee and taking in the sun outside Lviv's municipal hospital, Oksana - quick to smile - says she feels stronger and grateful, as she dusts some tree blossom off her husband's cheek. In part, she says, that is due to an outpouring of support from strangers around the world touched by that moment two weeks ago in the hospital ward when her husband gently lifted his bride, dressed in white, and held her tight as she buried her face in his shoulder and they swayed to tinny music playing on a laptop. Oksana posted the video on the social media site TikTok and she has since put up other short pieces of film of her trying to keep fit to music since the incident. They have been viewed many thousands of times, provoking the vital comments of support that Viktor says his wife has so treasured during these hard weeks. 'The dance was a complete surprise,' she says. 'We had come back to the hospital from the registry office and Natalia and Olesia [hospital volunteers] had brought a dress and a laptop for music. Natalia said, 'What kind of wedding is that without a dance?'' 'It was pure joy and happiness,' she adds of her response to Viktor picking her up. 'But then the realisation came. It's not how I wanted my first dance to be.' There have, of course, been innumerable other difficult moments, not least explaining the injuries to her children, who are staying with their grandfather in the Poltava region to the east. Oksana and Viktor, who are waiting to be taken for rehabilitation at a specialist hospital somewhere in the European Union, have not been able to see the children for weeks. But the memory of that day, and the precariousness of life in Ukraine today, is itself hard to get over, the couple say. The retelling only emphasises Oksana's extraordinary strength. 'We were coming back home and there's a stream at the back of our garden, so we wanted to make a shortcut and took a dirt road,' says Oksana. 'We knew this way very well. I was in front and my husband and friend behind, and I saw there was a missile not far from us, I turned towards Viktor, I yelled, 'Honey, look.' He looked at me and I just suddenly flew into the air, I heard a loud noise in my ears. I looked at my feet and they weren't there. Just bones.' Viktor ran to her. He was breathless, caught in a panic, he says. 'In my head I thought it was over for a moment,' he recalls. 'Then she started to move; she yelled to me to call the ambulance. But they refused to come close because they were afraid of the mines. They said it needed to be cleared.' The couple's friend called Oksana's stepfather on the phone. 'So we carried her with her stepdad and our friend, we carried her to the ambulance. Oksana, despite all the shock she was in, was in charge of everything. She pushed me and I went out of shock, she was the one who told me to call the ambulance. I don't know when would I have come to my senses if she didn't tell me. Then she helped the paramedic.' Oksana explains: 'The paramedic was a young inexperienced girl - apparently she had never seen anything like this. So I helped her. I knew my veins better. I asked for oxygen but they didn't have any. When we came to the hospital, I saw my mom. I saw her and cried 'Mummy', and I lost consciousness.' Oksana does recall brief snippets of the conversations of the medics working to save her life. 'When we were on the way to the hospital, the paramedics were saying, 'If only she was able to make it to the hospital.' When we came to the hospital, the doctors were saying, 'If only she was able to make it through the surgery.' But when the anaesthesia wore off and I came back to my senses, I realised - that's it. I have nothing. I was panicking, I didn't want to live, I didn't want my children to see me like this.' Oksana was transferred from Lysychansk to the city of Dnipro, 200 miles farther west. 'The doctors did an amazing job. They helped me a lot,' Oksana says. 'I realised my life was not over. I need to move on and I need to move on for the sake of my children.' Viktor adds: 'She was very depressed - she yelled she didn't want to live. But in Dnipro there were amazing rehabilitation doctors. They inspired Oksana. And then there was TikTok. She started to post some videos, got a lot of positive comments, and it helped to boost her morale.' Viktor proposed on the 27 April and they were married the next day. 'I just posted these videos just for myself,' Oksana says, 'I didn't think about becoming popular - I just wanted to document the process of recovery. How the rehabilitation goes ... and later, when I will hopefully have prosthetics, I will learn how to use them.' Viktor adds: 'It helps her. Whenever she has a minute, she is trying to read comments to her videos. She smiles, she is happier.' Oksana says she is determined to rebuild her life and continue her career in medicine - in the field of rehabilitation. 'And to show to the others with my own example that you can't give up, that everything is possible and you should keep living no matter what.'", "29e967e846ad6d39a82f0cdc654b7655f50fcc6d30b139a4e62d5ad5": "US president Joe Biden has announced another package of military assistance for Ukraine as dozens of civilians were evacuated from Mariupol's besieged steelworks, the last pocket of resistance against Russian troops in the pulverized port city. Worth $150m, the latest US security assistance for the 'brave people of Ukraine' would include artillery munitions and radars, Biden said. A senior US official said it included counter-artillery radars used for detecting the source of enemy fire, and electronic jamming equipment. Friday's new batch brings the total value of US weaponry sent to Ukraine since the invasion began to $3.8bn - and the president urged Congress to further approve a huge $33bn package including $20bn in military aid, 'to strengthen Ukraine on the battlefield and at the negotiating table'. Biden and leaders of other G7 nations will hold a virtual summit with Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Sunday. They are expected to discuss western support for Kyiv in its struggle against Russian president Vladimir Putin's invasion. It comes as the UN security council issued its first statement on the war in Ukraine, but withheld from using the words 'war', 'conflict' or 'invasion'. The statement instead 'expresses deep concern regarding the maintenance of peace and security of Ukraine' and voiced 'strong support' for secretary general Antonio Guterres in seeking a peaceful solution to the 'dispute'. 'The security council expresses deep concern regarding the maintenance of peace and security of Ukraine,' read the statement released on Friday night. Russia, which has a veto in the council, has stymied all prior bids to adopt a statement on Ukraine. In his latest national address, Zelenskiy said more than 40 women and children had been evacuated on Friday from the Mariupol steelworks after spending two months in underground shelters and that 'diplomatic options' were underway to 'rescue our soldiers'. The Russian defense ministry gave a figure of 50 civilians evacuated, including 11 children, saying they were handed over to the UN and Red Cross, which are assisting in the operation. It said the 'humanitarian operation' would continue on Saturday. About 200 civilians, including children, were estimated to still be trapped in the Soviet-era tunnels and bunkers beneath the sprawling Azovstal factory, along with a group of Ukrainian soldiers making their last stand. Russia announced a daytime ceasefire at the plant for three days starting on Thursday but the Ukrainian army said Russian 'assault operations' had continued by ground and by air. Ukraine's Azov battalion, leading the defence at Azovstal, said one Ukrainian fighter had been killed and six wounded when Russian forces opened fire during an attempt to evacuate people by car. Azov battalion leader Andriy Biletsky wrote on Telegram on Friday that the situation at the plant was critical. 'The shelling does not stop. Every minute of waiting is costing the lives of civilians, soldiers, and the wounded. Ten weeks into a war that has killed thousands, destroyed cities and uprooted more than 13 million people, defeating the resistance at Azovstal and taking full control of strategically located Mariupol would be a major win for Moscow. It would also be a symbolic success as 9 May approaches, the day Russia celebrates the Soviet victory over the Nazis in the second world war. Ukrainian officials believe Moscow is planning a parade in Mariupol but the Kremlin denied any such plans. White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, noted that the G7 meeting will come a day before 'Victory Day' and the leaders will demonstrate 'unity in our collective response' to 'Putin's war'. 'While (Putin) expected to be marching through the streets of Kyiv, that's obviously not what's going to happen,' Psaki said. Since failing to take Kyiv early on in the war, which began on 24 February, Russia has refocused its offensive on the south and east of Ukraine. Taking full control of Mariupol would allow Moscow to create a land bridge between separatist, pro-Russian regions in the east and the Crimean peninsula, which it annexed in 2014. Other key developments include:", "c0c5d64a7631e9bf736fd81a607444f199966544c1e6ffb478b79e2b": "The video was a terrible way for Vadim Yevdokimenko to find out that his father had been murdered. Alexei had been missing for weeks, since he went out in early March to scavenge firewood for cooking in their shattered, Russian-occupied town of Bucha. Yevdokimenko and his mother, Lilia, clung to a fading hope that he might have been captured and taken across the border, and that he would return in a prisoner exchange - the fate of some Ukrainian men. But this week the 20-year-old student barber spotted his father's face in footage of Ukrainians tortured and murdered during the occupation. The only solace the family can reach for now is giving Alexei a decent burial, but they cannot find his body. So they had come to wait outside a white tent set up in the grounds of Bucha hospital, where French forensic investigators were swabbing a queue of quietly desperate people for their DNA, to see if any of them have relatives lying in the nearby morgue. After weeks of exhumations, the morgue holds more than 200 bodies that have not been identified. Some were buried without documents and are waiting to be claimed, but many are too disfigured by their deaths, or their treatment after death, to be identified by sight. 'This is the first time we have done this. At first we didn't know how many people would come,' said Andrei Turbar, the deputy prosecutor for Bucha district, as dozens of relatives filled in forms and waited for their tests. The crowd underlined how many people are missing in just one small suburban town outside Kyiv. Ukrainians who saw their loved ones killed or have collected their bodies for burial are grappling with terrible grief. But thousands more are dealing with a loss compounded by the agony of uncertainty. Some are searching for children or parents, a spouse or siblings who went missing when the Russians were slaughtering civilians. Others got bad news from a friend or an image online, but have not been able to find the remains of the person they loved. So everyone lining up outside the tent in Bucha has come with the bleakest of hopes - to continue in limbo, confirm a death, or find a body they will be able to bury but not recognise. The UN's top human rights envoy, Michelle Bachelet, highlighted the torment of those with missing relatives 'desperate to know where they are, if they are alive, and how they can get them back', in a speech to the security council on Thursday. Vera Kunayeva and Olga Zaetz are friends whose sons were neighbours and went missing together in early March. The two women are praying their DNA will not match any of the bodies, so they can carry on believing the missing men may be prisoners somewhere in Russia, as Yevdokimenko and his mother did until a couple of days earlier. 'We came to do the DNA tests but we hope it is useless, and shows they are alive,' said Kunayeva, whose 40-year-old son, Vadim, is her only child, a family man with two teenagers. Zaetz's missing son Maxim is a factory worker and at 33 still her baby, the youngest of three brothers. The men went out at 5pm, neighbours said, and were never seen again. 'They started volunteering the first day when the Russians arrived, taking aid to older and vulnerable people,' Zaetz said. 'I wasn't worried because they were always doing it, they were used to helping.' The area was isolated by Russian troops, half-destroyed by shelling and then occupied, so residents who were hungry and reduced to cooking on open fires had to rely on each other for aid. Kunayeva's eyes filled with tears as she described what the village had been through, and remembered Vadim. 'We want this over, we want victory and the Russians destroyed.' The number of unidentified bodies in this small suburban town goes up and down daily, said Turbar. Even as some victims are identified by tattoos, scars or other marks, Bucha's sandy soil is still giving up more grim evidence of Russian brutality. 'In the beginning it was 40 or 50 people exhumed a day. It is going down now. Yesterday we had seven, today four,' Turbar said. Volunteers are helping retrieve bodies from shallow graves, because authorities cannot keep up. Many are only discovered when residents who fled return. 'People are coming back to find a grave in their garden,' Turbar said. 'Perhaps a person driving in a car was stopped by Russians at a checkpoint and they shot him there. Later they let local people bury the body in a nearby house. That wasn't a single incident, it was systematic.' Some of the bodies that cannot be identified were burned, some partly destroyed by the force of explosions that killed them. Russian soldiers intentionally disfigured the faces of some victims. Other corpses were left in cars or on the street so long that decomposition rendered them unrecognisable, after locals were banned from burying them or too afraid to attempt it as fighting raged. The overwhelming scale of atrocities has led to cruel confusion and bureaucratic layering of pain on top of terrible grief. At the morgue where Yevdokimenko went after seeing the video, he was presented with a single severed leg that workers insisted was all that remained of his father for burial. 'They were trying to push a body on me. [Dad's] cards were in the pocket but I think someone must have taken them,' he said. The trousers and shoe did not belong to his father, he said. When he challenged the workers they admitted that chaos often engulfed their efforts and confided that one body bag they opened this week contained three legs. A small town police force, government and hospital used to dealing with alcoholics, petty thieves and a few dozen deaths a year before Russia's invasion could hardly have been adequately prepared to handle one of the biggest war crimes investigations of the century. 'I am still afraid to walk around because I remember there was a Russian tank here or here. At the very end when they knew that they were leaving, they went street to street just killing everyone, grannies, grandpas, someone who was just sitting outside smoking,' Yevdokimenko said, adding that most of the victims were men. 'My classmate, who was 20, was shot because the Russians didn't like his trousers. There are only women left in my circle [so many of the men were killed].' Despite the scale of the challenge, Turbar says the town is determined to seek justice for the dead, and warn Russian forces still fighting in Ukraine - and reportedly committing fresh atrocities - that they cannot brutalise and murder with impunity. 'Emotionally it is very hard to look at these people, some of them I knew before, all the buildings that have been destroyed,' he said. 'But I feel an extreme responsibility to the people of Ukraine to collect evidence so we can take [the Russians] to court. 'What is happening here is nothing compared to Kharkiv and Mariupol, [the number of atrocities uncovered] are going to get even worse. For Bucha, it is over, but there it is still going on, civilians are still dying.'", "84bdc8398b4471bede186f3b4888c64b2e9956749ed03535a0dea090": "", "66149d20707d60a10c9f1c65a0dfe6084ba6cb0274da9ebc03fbe9f4": " Every week we wrap up the must-reads from our coverage of the Ukraine war, from news and features to analysis, visual guides and opinion. The last stronghold of resistance to Russia's siege of Mariupol, the sprawling Azovstal steelworks, has come under intense bombardment this week amid speculation, as Andrew Roth reports, that Russia aims to use the city as a prop in festivities to mark Victory Day on 9 May. This week hundreds of people have been evacuated from the city to safety. Among them, Natalia Usmanova told journalists that she felt her heart would stop as Russian bombs rained down on those hiding in a Soviet-era bunker underground. Azovstal evacuees who arrived in Zaporizhzhia were emotional. 'We are so thankful for everyone who helped,' said Anna Zaitseva, holding her six-month-old baby. 'There was a moment we lost hope, we thought everyone forgot about us.' Elina Tsybulchenko, another evacuee who made it to safety, said: 'They bombed like every second ... You can't imagine how scary it is when you sit in the shelter, in a wet and damp basement which is bouncing, shaking.' As the week ground on, fierce fighting moved inside the steelworks as more civilians fled the city on evacuation buses following weeks of brutal bombardment that have reduced much of it to rubble. Others remained trapped inside the complex. The UN described the city as a 'hellscape'. Roth explained why Mariupol is so important to Russia: the city that few Russians would have imagined as a prize before the war is home to a leading iron and steelworks that played an important role in the city's economy. It was a vibrant port with an active civil society that had withstood the Russian-backed advance in 2014, when Russian artillery came close enough to Mariupol to bombard the city's outer districts, before being driven back. The Kremlin could be keen to take the city as a strategic point in its goals to build a broad 'land bridge' to occupied Crimea, to gain access to another deep-water port that it used to transport coal, steel and grain, and as a symbolic victory - the largest city yet taken by Russia, which has failed to conquer Kharkiv or Kyiv. Amid mounting fears among western officials that Russia's war in Ukraine could drag on for months or years, the Kremlin appears to be focusing its operations around the city of Izium as part of renewed efforts to seize the entirety of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Peter Beaumont writes that the new focus of the Kremlin's war - aimed at building the land bridge from the Russian border to Crimea and beyond - has come with a shift in tactics to a slower and more deliberate advance as the Russian military has continued to struggle with logistics and other problems in managing its campaign. The latest stage of the offensive has been marked by an increased concentration of artillery, and the use of artillery fire, to support the slowly advancing Russian troops, with a Pentagon official describing 'slow and uneven' progress in fierce fighting in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. In Donetsk, the streets are empty. Emma Graham-Harrison and Vera Mironova report on the desperate and aggressive draft campaign by Russian-backed separatists controlling parts of eastern Ukraine driving many military-aged men into hiding. The separatist region backed and recognised by Russia announced its draft on 19 February, a few days before the invasion of the rest of Ukraine. To be exempt from the draft, you have to be signed off by senior government officials, who are one of the few groups to be spared the draft. In late March, pro-Russia authorities upped the age limit of the draft in Donetsk from 55 in 65, and on Saturday authorities announced mobilisation in Kherson, a region largely captured by Russia after the war began. Twice, authorities have tried to lure men out of hiding by claiming the draft was over. But when men came out of hiding, many were seized and drafted. Now, husbands, sons and brothers are living in basements and locked indoors at the homes of friends or relatives where no military-age men are registered as residents.  This week's string of mysterious blasts in Transnistria have become a warning sign for many to get out. And as men from the Moscow-backed separatist region in Moldova are being mobilised to fight alongside Russian troops, Paula Erizanu reports of waves of people fleeing to Turkey, Poland and the Czech Republic. On Monday, government buildings were hit by what appeared to be rocket-propelled grenades. The days that followed saw blasts hitting a Russian-broadcasting radio tower and shots reportedly fired near a Russian arms depot. Transnistria, near the Ukraine border, is predominantly Russian-speaking. And the growing concern on the ground is that Moldova could become the next front of the Ukraine war. In 1992 Moldova broke away from the Soviet Union, a year after the region declared its independence. This followed a five-month war where Russian forces intervened on the side of the separatists. No country, not even Russia, has recognised the self-declared Transnistrian Moldovan Republic, but the 'frozen conflict' has kept Moldova partitioned between Russia and Europe ever since. Now, many fear that last week's explosions may be the start of a dangerous thaw. Isobel Koshiw and Lorenzo Tondo report on civilian Ukrainians with no previous experience in exhumation wearing gardening gloves and volunteering to collect hundreds of bodies of those executed and buried in towns bordering Ukraine's capital. Thrust into what has been called one of the worst atrocities in Europe since the second world war, small-town police forces are relying on these ordinary civilians to help. According to Ukrainian prosecutors, more than 1,000 bodies have been recovered so far - many of whom were killed by bombs, making their remains harder to find. Ukrainians are inking the fight for their country on to their bodies, with artists getting requests for tattoos of molotov cocktails, anti-tank missiles and even a type of bread that has become an unlikely symbol of national identity because Russians struggle to pronounce it. Emma Graham-Harrison reports that as people filtered back to Kyiv after Russian troops abandoned their attempts to seize it, tattoo artists noticed an increasing demand for art that paid tribute to this spring of tragedy and violence, and to Ukraine's spirit of resistance. 'I wanted to capture this moment,' said Mariika, a tattoo artist who now has an anti-tank hedgehog on her leg and a molotov cocktail on her arm. For several Saturdays she has joined a group of tattoo artists gathered in a Kyiv party district for a fundraising day at a nightclub, currently out of action because of the war and curfew. Anyone can turn up for a tattoo, and the price is whatever they can afford to donate to the Ukrainian armed forces. Our visual guide to the invasion is updated regularly and can be found here.

In a statement on Friday night, the ministry said that Daniele Franco had signed the decree based on evidence that the owner of the Scheherazade, which has been undergoing a refit at a shipyard in Tuscany since September, has 'significant economic and business connections' with 'prominent elements of the Russian government and with others subject to EU sanctions'. The statement did not name the owner of the vessel, but said the ministry had asked the EU to place the individual on to the sanctions list. The yacht has been blocked pending the adoption of further restrictive measures. The order came amid fears that the vessel, said to be worth $700m (PS530m), was about to leave the shipyard in Marina di Carrara. The Scheherazade has been under investigation since March for potential links to sanctioned Russians, including Putin. A report in the New York Times said that it had been moved out of dry dock and into the water on Tuesday. The newspaper cited a crew member who said it could leave the port imminently. A spokesperson for the Italian Sea Group, a company that repairs and builds luxury yachts, told the Guardian that the vessel was scheduled to set sail by the middle of June.  Marianna Ferrante, the company's marketing director, said: 'Maintenance work is progressing and there are no scheduled departures anytime soon.' The company originally said the EUR6m refit would be completed in early 2023. The yacht is said to be equipped with a spa, swimming pools, two helipads, a wood-burning fireplace and a pool table designed to tilt so as to reduce the impact of the waves. Finance police in Marina di Carrara boarded the Scheherazade in early March as EU sanctions against Russian oligarchs kicked in over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. They seized ownership documents from the yacht's British captain, Guy Bennett-Pearce. At the time, US officials said they were also investigating whether the yacht belonged to Putin. Activists working with the jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny have also claimed Putin is the owner. A source at the finance police said the investigation was 'very complex' owing to a web of company names that could be concealing the real owner. 'As you can imagine, after all this time, it's not been easy [to identify] an owner, because of all the companies in between,' the source said. 'There is no more information we can give, and asking if it belongs to Putin is like a lottery.' The source would not confirm whether or not police were preparing to seize the vessel. An investigation by La Stampa newspaper in March linked the Scheherazade to Eduard Yurievich Khudainatov, the former president of the Russian state oil firm Rosneft, via a shell company registered in the Marshall Islands. Khudainatov is not on the sanctions list.", "5b0c61f36ce83240acb6c8c91a47b2fe7e77c277994382ee2c29a117": "Sinn Fein is to become the largest party in the Northern Ireland assembly for the first time. It reached 27 seats in the election, pushing the DUP into second place.  Michelle O'Neill is now set to become the country's first nationalist first minister. Ireland's taoiseach, Micheal Martin, said it was 'incumbent on all political parties' to form an executive in Northern Ireland. Reacting to the results of the Northern Ireland assembly election, he said: 'I would like to congratulate all of the successful candidates on their election. 'It is now incumbent on all political parties and elected representatives to deliver on their mandate, through the nomination of a first and deputy first minister and the formation of a new executive to serve the interests of all of the people of Northern Ireland. 'A new power-sharing executive is vital for progress and prosperity for all in Northern Ireland. 'As a co-guarantor of the Good Friday agreement, the government will continue to work in partnership with the British government and engage with the leaders of the political parties in Northern Ireland to seek and support the effective operation of all of the political institutions of the agreement.' While West Tyrone was on the surface another safe victory for Sinn Fein, in reality it was the SDLP that might have savoured the success most. After a bad few days for the nationalist party, SDLP supporters in the Magherafelt count centre were heartened by the victory of Daniel McCrossan, PA reports. One of the party's best-known faces in Stormont, McCrossan was returned with 11.9% of the first preference vote on the sixth count, alongside the DUP's Tom Buchanan. McCrossan offered his full support to party leader Colum Eastwood and defended the way the party ran its campaign. 'I think Colum Eastwood has led this election very, very strongly. I think the campaign has been energetic, we have had fantastic candidates. 'I'm talking about politics here in the north of Ireland. 'At this election, everyone on the doors told me they wanted change, the reality is the exact same mandate, only in slightly greater numbers, has been given to the DUP and Sinn Fein. Is that an election for change?'   Shortly after 7pm on Saturday, 88 of 90 Assembly seats had been filled. Sinn Fein currently has 27 seats while the DUP has 24, the Alliance Party 17, the Ulster Unionists (UUP) nine and the SDLP on seven, with four others. Boris Johnson will use the Queen's Speech as an effort to secure his leadership following a bruising set of local elections which saw the Tories lose control of key authorities and suffer a net loss of more than 400 councillors. The speech on Tuesday, setting out the Government's priorities, would focus on the economy, health and national security, Cabinet minister Nadhim Zahawi said as he urged Tory MPs to rally around the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister's troubles deepened on Saturday, with a constitutional headache in the form of Sinn Fein's victory in the Stormont elections, PA reports.   Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said: 'I encourage the parties to form an executive as soon as possible.  'The people of Northern Ireland deserve a stable and accountable local government that delivers on the issues that matter most to them. 'The electorate delivered a number of messages on Thursday. They were clear that they want a fully functioning devolved government in Northern Ireland, they want the issues around the protocol addressed, and that they want politics to work better. 'Over the coming days I will be meeting with all the party leaders and will urge them to restore the Stormont institutions at the earliest possible moment, starting with the nomination of an Assembly Speaker within eight days. 'The government remains committed to the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and will continue to work with the Northern Ireland parties and the Irish Government to deliver its vision for reconciliation, equality, respect for rights and parity of esteem. 'Together, we must move forward towards a brighter future - that means delivering for all the people of Northern Ireland.'  As Sinn Fein became the largest party in Stormont for the first time, shadow Northern Ireland secretary Peter Kyle said his party could act as an 'honest broker'.  He said: 'Congratulations to all the new assembly members and to Sinn Fein for earning the right to nominate a new first minister, it is healthy for Northern Ireland that parties from either community can nominate a first minister and shows the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement working. 'Unionism will still have a strong voice within powersharing and calls for progress on the remaining issues of the protocol have been heard and should not prevent a return to the executive.   'The Labour party will always be an honest broker for Northern Ireland, and we stand ready to help Stormont deliver on the promise of these elections and get an executive up and running to help people with the cost-of-living crisis we are facing across the United Kingdom.' Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon has tweeted: Activists accused Priti Patel of 'racist' and 'inhumane' policies over government plans to send migrants to Rwanda during her appearance at a Conservative party dinner.  The home secretary was speaking at the Bassetlaw Conservatives Spring Dinner in Nottinghamshire on Friday when several activists stood up on their chairs and began denouncing Patel for the policy. Footage published on Twitter by campaigning group Green New Deal shows a woman stand up and tell Ms Patel: 'Priti Patel, your racist policies are killing people.  'Your plans to send people seeking asylum to Rwanda are inhumane, they're inhumane and are going to ruin people's lives.' A Home Office spokesperson said: 'The world-leading migration partnership will overhaul our broken asylum system, which is currently costing the UK taxpayer PS1.5bn a year - the highest amount in two decades. 'It means those arriving dangerously, illegally or unnecessarily can be relocated to have their asylum claims considered and, if recognised as refugees, build their lives there. 'Our new migration and economic development partnership with Rwanda fully complies with international and national law.' Outgoing Stormont infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon has lost her seat in North Belfast amid an Alliance surge. The SDLP deputy leader stayed in the race until the final stage of the count on Saturday evening, when former lord mayor Nuala McAllister (Alliance) became the fifth and final MLA elected in the constituency. Sinn Fein's Gerry Kelly and Caral Ni Chuilin were both elected on the first count on Friday.  Sinn Fein is to become the largest party in the Northern Ireland assembly for the first time.

The Aspire party has taken control of Tower Hamlets in London from Labour after winning 24 of the 45 seats on the council, with two seats still to be declared. On Friday, Aspire's Lutfur Rahman defeated Labour incumbent John Biggs to become the elected mayor of Tower Hamlets.  Shortly after 6pm on Saturday, 81 of 90 Assembly seats in Northern Ireland had been filled. Sinn Fein currently has 23 seats while the DUP have 23, the Alliance Party 17, the Ulster Unionists (UUP) nine and the SDLP on six, with three others.  Foreign Office minister James Cleverly accused Keir Starmer of 'hypocrisy and dishonesty' over the 'beergate' row. A leaked memo published by the Mail on Sunday indicated the curry enjoyed by Starmer and colleagues in April 2021 while coronavirus restrictions were in force was planned in advance on the schedule for the day's campaigning, and that no further work was listed after the dinner. Cleverly said: 'Starmer claimed it was an impromptu curry. Turns out it was pre-planned. 'Starmer claimed nowhere served food. Turns out that loads of places did. '(Angela) Rayner claimed she wasn't there. Turns out she was. Hypocrisy and dishonesty in equal measure.'  Here is some interesting election analysis on the Northern Ireland results from PA. Sinn Fein has swept aside many years of history and is on course to become the first nationalist or republican party to take the largest share of seats in a Northern Ireland Assembly election. The results will be a significant psychological blow to Sir Jeffrey Donaldson's DUP, which has lost its position as the biggest party for the first time since 2003, when it usurped David Trimble's Ulster Unionists. Safe in the knowledge that the election was in its hands, Sinn Fein ran a safety-first campaign, seemingly unwilling to engage in any electoral trench warfare, preferring instead to portray vice-president Michelle O'Neill as the 'first minister for all' in waiting. The party also made a tactical decision not to labour the point over its desire to see Irish unity, concentrating instead on bread and butter issues such as the cost-of-living crisis and spiralling hospital waiting lists, which seem to have chimed positively with voters. The DUP's gamble on focusing its campaigning energy on unionist opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol and raising the spectre of a Sinn Fein victory increasing the possibility of a border poll on unity was less successful, with the party dropping both in its share of first preference votes and overall seats. The much anticipated Alliance Party surge has also become a reality in this election, with the cross-community party now set to become the third largest at Stormont. The growing support for Naomi Long's party seems to show an increasing percentage of the population in Northern Ireland want to move away from traditional orange and green politics. The election has been a crushing disappointment for the smaller unionist and nationalist parties, the UUP and SDLP. Despite their leaders receiving positive personal ratings, any increase in support at the ballot boxes failed to materialise. UUP leader Doug Beattie, who was spared the indignity of losing his Upper Bann seat, chose to contrast his approach to that of the DUP, insisting that he stood for positive politics, while Colum Eastwood of the SDLP won plaudits in the televised election debates for his articulate portrayals of the concerns facing voters. However, both parties leave the election facing the headache that they are further away than ever from challenging the hegemony of the larger unionist and nationalist parties. While the election is now settled, what is less clear is what it will all mean. Alliance leader Naomi Long topped the poll in Belfast East, where the same party strengths were returned to the Stormont benches. Long, whose party enjoyed a significant surge across Northern Ireland in the Assembly elections, described a 'rollercoaster of a week'. She dedicated her win in memory of her late father-in-law, who died recently. Long was elected on the first stage of the count along with DUP candidate Joanne Bunting. Her Alliance running mate Peter McReynolds was also elected to retain the party's two Assembly seats in the constituency. Long paid tribute to Chris Lyttle, who stood aside before the election, quipping that it felt like a divorce to no longer be working together.

Under his rule, the armed forces were the most advanced in Asia. Even more impressive: his family owns enormous quantities of gold, enough to save the world (it was given to Marcos by a royal family as payment for acting as their lawyer). It will be shared with the people if they regain power. The claims are all false. But that hasn't stop them from echoing across social media, saturating news feeds across the Philippines. Ferdinand Marcos left office in disgrace 36 years ago, ousted by the People Power Revolution, which drew millions on to the streets and forced the family to flee the presidential palace by helicopter. But tomorrow, the Marcos family is poised to make its comeback. Some 67.5 million Filipinos will go to the polls to decide who should replace the populist president Rodrigo Duterte who has reached the end of his six-year term and is barred from running again. Marcos' only son, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, known as Bongbong, is favourite to be elected - opinion polls put him far ahead of Leni Robredo, a former human rights lawyer and the current vice-president. A recent survey by Pulse Asia suggests he is the preferred candidate of 56% of voters; Robredo is favoured by just 23%. Analysts have decribed the race as a struggle over the truth, and the culmination of a decades-long campaign to rewrite history and rehabilitate the Marcos name. The election is not being fought just with data and evidence, said Ronald Mendoza, dean of Manila's Ateneo School of Government: 'It's a battle of disinformation.' The Marcoses and their supporters have sought to revise the story of their era and of martial law imposed in 1972, often described as one of the most painful episodes in the country's history. They deny or dismiss the widespread torture documented by rights groups, the extrajudicial killings and the plundering of billions of dollars. Instead, the period is portrayed as a golden age of peace and prosperity. For survivors of the Marcos regime, the acceptance of such accounts by significant sections of the public is incomprehensible. 'If ever he wins, he will be winning on the basis of false narratives and historical distortion,' said Bonifacio Ilagan, convenor of Campaign Against the Return of the Marcoses and Martial Law. 'I lived through the military dictatorship. I have been imprisoned twice. I have been tortured. I had my sister disappeared and most probably killed, friends suffering the same. And now Marcos Jr is making a comeback. It is horrible. It is like a nightmare,' he said. Partnerships have formed to tackle false online claims, including #FactsFirstPH, formed by media outlets such as Rappler, which was cofounded by Nobel laureate Maria Ressa, which has joined with church groups, researchers and others. Tsek.Ph, a coalition of universities, journalists and civil society groups, also corrects false claims on soical media online. 'Every day we sift through this tsunami of disinformation, and decide which ones to fact check. There are just too many,' says Maria Diosa Labist, associate professor at the University of the Philippines' Department of Journalism, and a coordinator of Tsek.Ph. Tsek.Ph runs a tipline where the public can report questionable posts, while researchers also sift through social media for viral disinformation. Its analysis shows that both Robredo and Marcos have been the subject of false claims. But disinformation about Robredo has been overwhelmingly negative, questioning her competence and character. Of the false claims about Marcos, almost all sought to enhance his image, or that of his family. Many relate to his father's era: for example, wrongly claiming that no Marcos critics were arrested during martial law, or that all ill-gotten wealth cases against the family have been dismissed. On TikTok and YouTube, accounts aligned to Marcos seek to glamorise the dynasty, with montages of archive footage, and clips of his sons who are adored by a younger supporter base. 'Marcos Jr himself, his political career and accomplishment aren't really impressive,' said Fatima Gaw, assistant professor of communication research at the University of the Philippines College of Mass Communication. His appeal hinges on his promise to restore his father's legacy, which is the centre of online campaigns. At a recent Marcos concert in Bulacan, the mood was nostalgic. The crowd, dressed in Marcos red, sang along to 70s and 80s rock songs. Attendees spoke fondly of the past. 'His father did a lot of things [for the Philippines]. He built highways, bridges, hospitals,' said Zenaida Catindig, 59. Catindig does not believe the Marcos family stole money from the Philippines. 'If there's a case, they should be in jail right now. They're not in prison. Why are they free, if they are corrupt?' she said. The family has faced a raft of cases, and it has been ruled at home and internationally that the Marcoses possessed ill-gotten wealth. Marcos Jr's mother, Imelda, infamous for her collection of 3,000 pairs of shoes, is appealing a 2018 criminal conviction on seven graft charges. John Agbayani, chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good Government, which was set up to investigate and recover the Marcos family's funds, told Reuters last week that it had retrieved about $5bn, and that a further $2.4bn was bogged down in litigation. More remains missing. Despite such evidence, supporters are unconvinced. 'The Marcos family was wealthy even before they entered politics,' said Catherine Dayao, a 22-year-old student attending the Bulacan concert. Marcos was a lawyer for a royal family, she said. Her brother, a history teacher, told her. 'I can see in him the qualities of his father,' Dayao said, explaining his appeal. 'Bongbong will bring back discipline to Filipinos.' Surveys suggest Marcos is the preferred candidate among all age groups. However, analysts point to the large number of younger voters in the Philippines, who have no memory of martial law. 'There is exposure to disinformation even at very young ages,' said Mendoza. 'They appear to have planted the seeds for future success.' Ensuring there is factually accurate information about the Marcos era should become increasingly crucial even for future elections, he said. Filipinos have ranked at the top of global surveys for time spent on social media, increasing the country's vulnerability to disinformation. Social media platforms were manipulated by president Duterte as he campaigned for election in 2016, and have been weaponised to silence criticism of his administration. One Facebook official described the country as 'patient zero' in a fake news crisis that has grown to threaten democracies around the world. Yet researchers say that what is happening now is far more organised and insidious than Duterte's troll farms. In 2016, the Philippines was experiencing the mere infancy of disinformation campaigns, said Gaw. 'Fast forward six years from then and we see there's actually a whole supply chain that performs this information work for the Marcoses,' she said. If a criticism of Marcos Jr is reported in mainstream media, a counter narrative is quickly provided by a network of online influencers, Gaw said, describing the system as far more industrialised. Proving that such accounts are funded by the Marcos family, or determining the size of the misinformation business is challenging. But it is clear that spreading misinformation is easy work, and it pays, adds Gaw. 'It's so profitable that even if you don't believe in Marcos Jr you would promote him.' Marcos Jr has denied the existence of any organised disinformation campaign. However, in January, Twitter suspended hundreds of accounts that were promoting his campaign for violating its rules on spam and manipulation. Researchers in the Philippines have long accused social media companies of failing to take online misinformation seriously, and of allowing their platforms to be exploited. While Filipinos are among the most keen users of social media globally, these platforms have moderation policies designed with a western perspective, prioritising areas such as alt-right content, said Gaw. 'In the Philippines there's really no alt-right version of things. It's just different political families battling for power.' Tsek.ph does not have a special arrangement with platforms to remove false content, though some members are accredited as third-party fact checkers with Facebook. Of the posts the Tsek.ph coalition reports, it has no idea how many are removed. Stories often reappear and move between different social media sites. Often, claims have been circulating for years and become entrenched within some online communities. Trying to counter such beliefs, in a country where the media has been maligned, threatened and harassed, is an uphill battle. Ilagan fears the election of Marcos Jr would curtail freedoms, and scupper efforts to regain the family's ill-gotten wealth. It would also further distort democracy, he said. 'I think the Marcoses planned the whole thing since they were ousted from the presidential palace. They had all the time, and all the money to design a comeback.' 'How can democracy be true when a handful decides the fate of the greater majority?'

The huge success of Covid vaccines in countries able to get them has led to sharp declines in deaths and severe disease from the virus, even though the latest Covid variant, Omicron, has spread rapidly. 'We need a new vaccine to stop transmissions and there are lots of interesting ideas,' said Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University and a former member of the UK vaccine taskforce who has worked on the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid jab. 'Deaths from the disease, those really awful deaths, had largely been eliminated by the late spring [2021], and they rumbled along, at a very low level and very close to baseline, and they've continued to rumble along almost in a flat line since then,' he said. The baseline represents the number of UK deaths that should be expected based on average mortality data before the pandemic. However, the spread of coronavirus remains a problem, leading to hospitalisation of vulnerable people, keeping many off work and leaving a number of people with long-term health issues. Scientists are pinning their hopes on nasal sprays, rather than shots in the arm, which aim to produce strong immune protection in the nose and throat, to block Covid infections at the gates. More than a dozen trials are under way. 'It's an interesting question whether any of the [current] vaccines have a long-term future,' Bell said. 'None of them are very good at stopping transmissions,' he said and as variants emerged 'they get less good over time' at preventing people becoming sick. 'So you've got a couple of choices. You can make a new vaccine every time you see a variant and it may be less good than the original vaccine so you end up chasing your tail. You could probably use the existing vaccines to boost the elderly people at some sensible interval, preventing them from dying. We have to wait and see if we do see more deaths in that population ... but we haven't seen them yet.' The Canadian immunologist also said 'the booster had no impact on deaths, despite all the rah-rah,' suggesting that two vaccine doses were enough to prevent death and serious illness. 'The booster was driven by the perceived need to increase neutralising antibody levels,' he said. 'This might have some impact on transmissions and symptoms, although we all know it does not do much for Omicron transmissions, but protection against mortality has other correlates and the death rate in doubly vaccinated people looks very low. Indeed the vast majority of deaths are unvaccinated.' The UK's current spring booster campaign, the fourth jab, is targeted at the over-75s, care home residents and those who are immunocompromised. Bell is in favour of another round of booster shots in the autumn for those over 65 and vulnerable people with poorer immune systems, but like some other experts, said he saw little point in offering repeat vaccinations to healthy younger people, children and teenagers, unless a more serious Covid variant emerged. He said he was 'not massively enthusiastic' about immunising very young children. 'Their risk of severe illness is low with Covid and they almost never die. If we had a great transmission blocking vaccine then doing kids would make sense but we don't. Most of the world is going to get Covid, we need to get used to it.' He estimated a 'very high' chance that any new variant will be relatively mild, like Omicron, while the chances of a more lethal variant emerging were 'very low but not nothing'. 'We need to be on the lookout for a highly pathogenic variant that might start killing people at scale and is evading the vaccine response but we see no sign of that today.'", "dea9ca351fec8ad27e5113305993735e4dfa391339bbd7af68806352": "A patient is being treated at a specialist unit in London after they were diagnosed with monkeypox, a rare viral infection. The person had recently travelled to Nigeria, where they are believed to have contracted the illness, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said on Saturday. They are being treated in an isolation unit at Guy's and St Thomas' infectious disease unit. Although monkeypox can be spread during close contact with an infected person, the agency said it did not spread easily and most people recovered in a few weeks. As a precaution, the UKHSA said its experts were working closely with the NHS and would be contacting those who may have had close contact with the person, including some passengers who were on the same flight. Early symptoms of monkeypox include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can also develop, usually starting on the face before spreading to other areas of the body. The rash progresses through different states until it forms a scab which falls off. Dr Colin Brown, director of clinical and emerging infections at the UKHSA, said: 'It is important to emphasise that monkeypox does not spread easily between people and the overall risk to the general public is very low.' He added: 'UKHSA and the NHS have well-established and robust infection control procedures for dealing with cases of imported infectious disease and these will be strictly followed.' Dr Nicholas Price, director of NHSE high consequence infection diseases (airborne) network and consultant in infectious diseases at Guy's and St Thomas', said: 'The patient is being treated in our specialist isolation unit at St Thomas' hospital by expert clinical staff with strict infection prevention procedures.' The NHS said infection could be caught from infected wild animals in parts of west and central Africa and was believed to be spread by rodents. Only a few people have been diagnosed with monkeypox in the UK, all of whom had either travelled to west Africa or been in close contact with somebody who had. According to information produced by Public Health England (the agency replaced by UKHSA last year), monkeypox was first discovered in 1958 when outbreaks of a 'pox-like disease' were found in monkeys in captivity for research. The first human case was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Since then, it said, most cases have been reported from DRC and Nigeria, but there have been a handful of cases further afield. In 2003, cases were recorded in humans and pet prairie dogs in the US after rodents were imported from Africa. In December 2019, a patient was diagnosed with monkeypox in England, which PHE said was the fourth case diagnosed in the UK since the first imported cases the year before. There have also been cases in Israel and Singapore.", "014fcf14e4671dccb43eed7537ce1afdeaa08826d0bceb73590e8a11": "At the height of Hong Kong's protests in the summer of 2019, angry pro-democracy legislators shouted in the Chinese territory's legislative council: 'down with John Lee!', as the veteran security chief defended his force's treatment of the protesters and journalists. 'I hope people will understand the chaotic situation and the pressure faced by each and every one at the scene on that day,' Lee said, unapologetically. 'I hope members of the public will not vent their dissatisfaction of the government on police officers, because they are only discharging their duties.' On Sunday Lee, 64, who built a long career in police and security and oversaw the the heavy-handed crackdown on anti-Beijing protesters in 2019, is set to become Hong Kong's new chief executive in a single-candidate selection process to succeed Carrie Lam. Like Lam, he was among the first Hong Kong and mainland Chinese officials to be on the US sanctions list for their role in eroding the city's once-guaranteed rights and freedoms. But despite the controversy, by the time the leadership poll takes place more than half of the nearly 1,500 people selected to cast ballots would have already showed their support to Lee - guaranteeing him victory. 'By picking John Lee as the candidate without competition, Beijing is sending a message to the outside world,' said Ho-fung Hung, a Hong Kong-born professor of political economy at Johns Hopkins and the author of the book City on the Edge: Hong Kong Under Chinese Rule. 'The message is that Beijing has cemented control and will continue its tough policy in Hong Kong,' he said. Lee joined Hong Kong's police force as an inspector in 1977. He rose through the ranks and, in 2017 became the head of the government's Security Bureau. Like many of his peers, he speaks fluent English and was educated abroad, holding a master's degree in public policy and administration from Charles Sturt university in Australia. In the last few years, Lee has shown his staunch support for the controversial national security law that was passed in 2020. The legislation bars secession, subversion, and collusion with foreign forces. Since its enactment, dozens of pro-democracy legislators have either been arrested or have moved abroad. Au Nok-hin, who led the chanting of 'Down with John Lee' in that council session three years ago, was among the 55 members of the opposition who were arrested under the national security law last year. Lee's opponents worry that the former security tsar would eventually turn Hong Kong into another mainland Chinese city by further eroding its once-proud traditions - for example, of press freedom. Last year Lee oversaw the freeze of media tycoon Jimmy Lai's assets, which eventually led to the closure of one of the city's most popular pro-democracy tabloid newspapers, Apple Daily. In November Lee told RTHK, the local public broadcaster, that the government was looking into 'different tactics' to target 'fake news' through legislation. A few months before, the city's new police chief, Raymond Siu, called for a 'fake news' law to tackle 'hostility against the police'. Despite being a sole contender for the top job, Lee has in the past weeks been seen making policy pledges and receiving a growing number of supporters from the city's establishment. On 20 April 148 high-profile figures, including tycoon Li Ka-shing and film star Jackie Chan joined his campaign as advisers. Lee is widely seen as a 'dependable and devoutly loyal' figure to Beijing. Dissenting voices have largely disappeared following last year's electoral changes that allowed only 'patriots' in legislature polls. Before the December vote, Lee warned that candidates who had been banned from running for failing the 'patriots' criteria would try to thwart the elections. 'We have to make sure that they will not succeed,' he said. Analysts say that stability and security will be Lee's main focus. In a closed-door rally on Friday, Lee met with more than 1,000 local figures who will vote and urged the public to have a 'collective mindset'. His supporters also praised him for 'helping Hong Kong to restore order from chaos'. According to a 44-page manifesto published last week, Lee's priority would be to enact Article 23 of the city's constitution. Previous Hong Kong administrations had tried - but failed - to make it happen.  'But whether he would enact Article 23 is a moot point', said Prof Steve Tsang, a Hong Kong politics expert at SOAS in London. 'This is because the state security apparatus is already in place through the national security legislation. Therefore, there's no guarantee they'd end up doing that.' Hung said that Lee's security background inevitably sends a strong message, but looking at the dynamics between Hong Kong and Beijing over the course of the Covid outbreak in the city earlier this year, one could also see the ultimate limit to Beijing's sway in the city. 'It seems to me that Beijing still has not decided how to strike a balance between security and maintaining Hong Kong's unique role as an offshore financial centre. The tug-of-war is going to continue for some time under Lee's watch,' he added.", "41f66e447b6a723ade8202e45898966498eaed7136e903f9d5b3ab4f": "An Indian climber died has during a summit push on Mount Kanchenjunga, the world's third highest mountain, an official said. The death is the third to be reported on Nepal Himalayas during the current climbing season which started in March. Narayanan Iyer, 52, died at around 8,200m (26,900ft), while trying to reach the 8,586 metre (28,169 feet) peak on Thursday, said Nivesh Karki, an official of the hiking company, Pioneer Adventure, that organised the expedition. 'Iyer's guide advised him to turn back after he was feeling unwell but he refused,' Karki said while confirming the death. 'He was slower than others and we had two guides assist him. He was very exhausted, couldn't continue and collapsed.' There were several other teams on the mountain, including a Pakistani group that saw one of its members, Sirbaz Khan, become the first person from that country to climb 10 peaks over 8,000m high. Last month a Greek climber and a Nepali Sherpa guide died on other peaks. Mountain climbing is the main tourism activity and a key source of income as well as employment in Nepal, which has eight of the world's 14 highest mountains including Mount Everest. More than 900 foreign mountaineers have received permits to climb 26 Himalayan peaks in Nepal, including Mount Everest, during the current season ending in May.

The Bathophilus flemingi, also known as the highfin dragonfish, was captured on video by a team of researchers in Monterey Bay, California. Named after the mythical creature, the torpedo-shaped fish is a predator that roams the depths of the ocean. The fish can grow up to 16.5cm in length and has long thin rays for fins. Scientists think the wing-like filaments can detect vibrations and can alert the fish of oncoming predators and prey. The dragonfish uses a sit-and-wait tactic in which it hangs motionless in midwater and waits for unsuspecting crustaceans and fish to feed on, according to the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI). It also uses a bioluminescent filament that extends from its chin. 'It uses that to attract prey that see the spot of glowing light and get drawn to it because they think it's something small enough that they can eat,' Bruce Robison, a senior scientist at MBARI told Live Science. Upon encountering its prey, the fish will open its jaws, revealing a set of sharp teeth, and snap its mouth shut. 'In more than three decades of deep-sea research and more than 27,600 hours of video, we've only seen this particular species four times! We spotted this individual just outside of Monterey Bay at a depth of about 300 meters (980 ft),' the researchers said in a YouTube video caption of the dragonfish swimming. The fish captured by researchers on camera had a bronze hue unlike that of any other deep-sea species. 'They are just amazing animals, and part of what is appealing is that color pattern,' Robinson said. He added the bronze hue could probably be a type of camouflage as it absorbs the blue light that reaches the ocean's depths. As a result, the fish blends into its dark environment and becomes nearly invisible. 'But when we shine our white lights on it, it's just gorgeous,' Robinson said.", "a1159151373153de162ae55807c7bf433a12596b3e4c64484ef24246": "Abba pulses through the nightclub and I dramatically burst into tears due to a recent breakup. I apologise for my outcry to friends over a late-night takeaway. I watch The Worst Person in the World on a Sunday night solo date and weep into my popcorn. I meet my mum for lunch and wail over a jacket potato. 'I'm...' I start. She interjects. 'Stop. Saying. Sorry.' I was born the year Prozac came to market in the UK. In 2004, by the age of 14, I was a Prozac user. It's strange to think that as a young, confused teen, I had been part of a profound social-historical change. Before the mid-2000s, adolescents taking psychiatric medication experienced a hefty stigma. If, like me, you were born in the 1990s, you've lived through a psychopharmacological breakthrough. In 2021, the number of teens taking antidepressants in the UK reached an all-time high. And, according to the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, the number of patients under 17, medicated for anxiety, rose by 26% between 2015 and 2020. In the wake of the breakup, I decide to make a trip home to my parents, so I can wallow, yes, but also so I can trail through a box of psychiatric medical notes from my adolescence that I find in the loft. 2004: 'Your daughter is describing a classical description of florid depersonalisation. This is normally onset by a trauma. The standard treatment is a few weeks on SSRIs. I suggest we start her on Prozac. It's not yet licensed for her age, but I think it's our best port of call.' Depersonalisation is a type of anxiety disorder that can manifest as a feeling of being disconnected or detached from the world. For some people, including my teenage self, it can feel as though the world is like a movie that we are watching rather than being a part of. When I ask my mum about those difficult years, she tells me she had no idea what was wrong with me. 'You were struggling and it had gone on so long. You were desperate. We didn't really talk about mental health before you came along. Other than Auntie Nancy' - my 101-year old great-aunt, who had shock therapy after witnessing someone get crushed by a train - 'but even she kept it all hushed up. Me and Dad, we didn't really know much about it.' I try to push her further. The psychiatrist said depersonalisation is often brought on by trauma. I search for environmental triggers. 'It was so physical,' my mother says. 'I tried my best to talk things through with you, to calm you. But you were getting worse and it was hard to watch. So I went to the GP and she referred me to a child psychiatrist.' I still remember how it manifested physically. It began way before the depersonalisation days of my teenage years. I was 10 when I developed an unbending need to 'organise the house' before bedtime. I'd spend an hour lining up all the kitchen utensils in a straight line, followed by the ornaments in the living room. The finale took place in my bedroom. I'd spend an infuriating amount of time putting my slippers in the 'right' place, making sure my cupboard doors were perfectly shut, lining my curtains up 'correctly'. If I didn't, something horrible would ensue, probably involving freak accidents, cancer and a family member. Or so I convinced myself. And then when my teenage years hit, the anxiety became more extreme. I first experienced a depersonalisation attack just before my GCSEs in a busy Topshop store and became convinced I was in the midst of a dream so took to shaking a poor, helpless stranger to 'wake me up'. Those waves happened countless times. Eventually, that dreamlike state went from lasting for short periods to becoming chronic. I was so disassociated, so ghost-like, I felt I was experiencing two worlds unfolding at the same time: my external reality and the chaotic internal experience in my head. No wonder my parents felt desperate. 'I didn't know what to do,' my mother says. 'I remember Dad was watching The Sopranos around the time we took you to the psychiatrist. Remember Tony mentions Prozac? We felt relieved! To hear someone else mention it all. It made us feel less alienated.' Mum would try to reassure me, saying: 'I'm diabetic, I use insulin. You're anxious, you use Prozac.' That was the tagline for SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors): it prioritised the scientific cause and put the social on the backbench. We know now that the serotonin-imbalance theory (that anxiety and depression were caused by low levels of serotonin) is not the answer. 'There is not a single peer-reviewed article that can be accurately cited to directly support claims of serotonin deficiency in any mental disorder, while there are many articles that present counterevidence' (2014, Lacasse and Leo). And yet I, and millions of other teenagers, swallowed the narrative that we were chemically unwell and muted the social context surrounding it. I was hugely fortunate that I didn't experience an intense traumatic event. But, there were some pretty evident triggers leading to my highly anxious state. I spent two years, as a young kid, out of school filming a television soap surrounded by adults and adult issues (drugs, sex and secrets). Weekends were spent with my tight-knit family at my aunt's house. She was paralysed from her neck down due to MS. Each Sunday we witnessed her body decline and her struggle increase while having to keep up a stifling veneer of loud positivity. I couldn't handle the emotional silence.  Alongside all of that, transitioning to being a teenager is a universally terrifying experience. For my age group, it was the era when the internet unleashed its dirty claws and our carefully constructed world became an intense flood of terrorist attacks, celebrity breakdowns and misogynistic porn that I couldn't get my eyes away from. And although I was one of the lucky ones to receive Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, my sessions focused more on 'coping' than 'feeling'. So, I clung tightly on to the more palatable belief that I was 'ill' and with medication I'd be 'well'. 2005: 'She's been complaining of a number of symptoms. It seems she is highly anxious. Previously she had depersonalisation. I recommend we put her on Escitalopram.' I ask Mum if they were nervous about me taking Prozac. 'It wasn't something we wanted to do. It felt like there was no choice. It was urgent and we were out of our depth.' And it worked. Before, I couldn't get through a night without waking in the early hours fuelled with adrenaline, with my legs cycling in the air - in the midst of a panic attack. I couldn't get through a day without ringing my mum, filled with terror, from the school toilets. I felt like I had very little control over my thoughts and experiences. Soon, though, with the help of my nightly pill, the voice in my head, my distorted reality and general existentialism dissolved and finally I was able to focus on things other than my own draining existence. The SSRIs potentially saved my life, but they also changed my life. While my peers were experiencing the dark depths of emotion, I had learned to distrust myself. To Kill a Mockingbird was one of the GCSE texts at the time. My love for it was shaded by a selfish preoccupation. Atticus tells Scout: 'Before I can live with other folks I've got to live with myself. The one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience.' I remember reading the line aloud in class and spiralling. 'How can I live with myself if I don't know who I am without these drugs pumping around my brain and body?' I'd been on the medicine for at least a year and the question made me bereft. When our culture tells us that our teenage years are the most critical and formative stages for our search for selfhood, how are the psychologically medicated meant to take part in this rite of passage? And I can only imagine how this must feel even more pressing for teenagers now growing up in an era that worships 'self love' and pays homage (and money) to nurture the 'authentic self'. These were the years of impending firsts that would shape my future. I'd yet to have my first kiss let alone my first sexual experience, my first friend breakup, my first grief; I didn't know my social niche, my political leanings, the music I liked, the type of relationships I wanted to build. I didn't know myself. And the films I was watching and the books I was reading were telling me that during these core years, I would work out my identity. Problem was, I was pilled up. The idea of introspection filled me with horror; it was the very act that earned me the 'mental health patient' status in the first place. Rather than allowing space and time to listen to my emotions and responses, I disregarded them as meaningless chemical mutations. 2008: 'I think it would help if we increased her citalopram. The panic isn't subsiding, so I think this will do us good.' And so I cracked on, while other teens were rebelling or arguing with their parents or having their hearts broken, and committing to the rollercoaster highs and lows of puberty, I wasn't really. I got good grades, I kissed boys, I pursued my dream of acting, I swallowed my pills and I got on with it. Adolescent psychiatrist Professor Peter Hill, who headed Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at St George's, University of London and later worked as a consultant psychiatrist at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, explains: 'We have to be careful about the chosen dosage of SSRIs and medication that we administer to young people. It needs to be part of the discussion when deciding on a treatment plan... Young men and women can experience loss of libido and this is particularly important to consider during the ages where many experience a sexual awakening. Problem is, GPs are time-poor and resource-poor, which leaves them with little else to do than prescribe.' At 23, now on a 20mg dose of citalopram, I was in a rehearsal room with a cast of actors taking part in a bizarre acting technique known as 'emotional recall'. That meant summoning traumatic moments from our past and reliving them in front of an audience. I watched as 14 young people broke down to the applause of our director. And then it was my turn - I was reliving the death of my aunt. Her decline from MS to ovarian cancer. I built the space, set the scene, and then... Nothing. I felt nothing. Dead. Numb. In that moment it dawned on me, I hadn't cried for the entire time I had been on medication. That was my trigger. Within a matter of weeks, I sought help to deprescribe myself in a slow weaning-off process. 2013: 'We can decrease your citalopram now. If your anxiety increases, come back to me.' I recall the first time I cried again: I was watching The Curious Incident of The Dog in The Night-Time and a golden retriever puppy pops its head out of a gift box. I was so enthusiastic about the tears pouring out of me they basically stopped immediately. My mum laughs when I tell her. 'I was so nervous when you came off about how you would deal with things without medication. I didn't know if you had the tools to get through.' I was nervous, too. The process of untangling 'normal emotions' and my medical judgment of them has been a long and ongoing task. I've found myself clinging on to various other numbing devices to swerve me from looking inwards, but slowly and with some integrative therapeutic help I started to allow myself to 'feel' without immediate analysis. I experienced and breathed into my anxious edges. Professor Hill tells me: 'We don't know the long-term chemical effects of SSRI use when prescriptions are continued for years. If possible, caregivers and medical professionals need to be cautious about treating young patients year in year out.' No randomised clinical trials have yet been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of long-term treatment in primary care. This is an infuriating fact to hold while acknowledging the current state of the mental healthcare system. Young people are at the mercy of their doctors and their caregivers and most are doing the best they can with what they've got. And what they've got is pretty dire. The NHS had 4.3m referrals for conditions such as anxiety and depression in 2021, and 25% of them were for children and teenagers. So it's no surprise that so many GPs are reaching for medication while their patients slowly climb up the waiting list for therapeutic help. I ask my mum if she'd change anything. 'About medication?' I nod. 'I don't think I'd do anything differently. They brought you back to us.' She reflects the question. 'Do you wish we handled it differently?' I think about the day I met the psychiatrist as a 14-year-old scared of the world. I imagine him taking off his glasses and rather than reaching for a prescription for the wonder drug of the decade, he leans forward on his chair and says, 'Daniella, I understand.' He says: 'Being a teenager is a pretty insane experience.' He acknowledges the reality of it all. 'It's scary to see a family member get sick, it's scary to realise your parents are flawed, it's scary to notice the systemic injustice in the world and the overwhelming pressure to work out your view on things.'  He'd offer me some psychotherapy, he'd advise me to visit my aunt alone, and hold her hand, and ask her how she feels about facing her impending mortality. He'd urge me to limit my time in front of screens and to spend more time outside. He'd remind me to eat well and suggest joining a sports team. He'd smile and tell me to fancy whoever I wanted. He'd encourage me to spend time with friends and to not be afraid to tell them how I'm feeling. He'd tell me to write to my MP to prevent our national mental health services from being decimated and reassure me that it's possible to make change in the world. And after, he'd send me on my way and ask me to come back in a week to decide if I want to start taking Prozac. My hunch is, this wouldn't have made a single bit of difference and I'd come back the following week even more bereft and desperate for medication. By the time I found myself in the psychiatrist's chair in 2004, I felt like I was living in a pretty disgraceful dimension; I was terrified. I reply to my mum. 'No. I needed an intervention. I just wish I hadn't viewed my experience purely as a biomedical imbalance that needed to be fixed. I wish it had been less binary.' My mum agrees. 'We've all changed. We've all developed. There's more emotional space for all of us now.' My mum and I clear away the papers, come down from the loft and watch Notting Hill on her bed. I laugh wildly and then cry immediately. My mum hands me the tissues and I stop myself apologising for the tears.", "82c80a98876ab8f681c4a4e127083aab9aca43247ed3a2dce5e7c8f5": "Savita Halappanavar was 31 years old when she died of blood poisoning nearly a week after she arrived at University Hospital Galway (UHG) in Ireland complaining of intense back pain. Halappanavar, a dentist from Karnataka, in south-west India, was 17 weeks pregnant with her first child and went to hospital with her husband, Praveen, on Sunday 21 October 2012. Within hours, doctors said a miscarriage was inevitable, even though a foetal heartbeat could be heard. By this point, Halappanavar was in 'unbearable' pain and 'very upset', according to healthcare staff. The plan was, she was told, to 'wait and see' if she would miscarry naturally. At the time, Irish law stated that abortions were permitted only if there was a 'real and substantive' threat to a woman's life. By Tuesday, there had been no miscarriage. The couple asked whether one could be induced but were told by the doctor: 'Under Irish law, if there's no evidence of risk to the life of the mother, our hands are tied so long as there's a foetal heart[beat].'  Halappanavar developed a high fever. On the Wednesday morning, the medical team diagnosed infection and, later, septic shock. Her condition was deteriorating rapidly. A plan was made, but not enacted, to give Halappanavar a drug to induce abortion. According to the Health Service Executive inquiry, by this point, the death of the foetus was certain and the appropriate treatment was to terminate the pregnancy because of the risk to Halappanavar's life. Halappanavar spontaneously miscarried mid-afternoon on Wednesday and was admitted to intensive care. She was now critically ill with severe sepsis and multiple organ failure. She suffered a cardiac arrest and died in the early hours of Sunday 28 October, almost a week after being admitted. The case sparked outrage in Ireland and highlighted how the law put women with life-threatening medical conditions at risk in Irish hospitals. In media interviews, Halappanavar's husband revealed that he and his wife had repeatedly asked for the pregnancy to be terminated but had been refused and told: 'This is a Catholic country.' Protesters took to the streets, calling for accountability and change, accusing the Irish state of failing to protect its citizens. An Amnesty International report in 2015 said her 'entirely preventable death was a consequence of Ireland's restrictive abortion law'. Anti-abortion campaigners said the case was being exploited by those with an agenda to liberalise Ireland's laws, and the Catholic church declared that a woman had no more right to life than the foetus. The government, under intense public scrutiny, carried out multiple inquiries into Halappanavar's death. In the HSE's final report, the investigation team stated that a termination of pregnancy was medically indicated and would have been performed in 'other jurisdictions'. In May 2018, Ireland voted by a landslide to repeal its near-total ban on abortion. The referendum - in which 66.4% voted Yes, a majority of 706,349 - drew the highest turnout for a ballot on social issues. Olga Reyes, 22, waited in pain for hours at the hospital ward in 2006. She had already been turned away from one hospital but arrived at the next one with the proof that she needed urgent care: an ultrasound scan from a private clinic that showed an ectopic pregnancy was rupturing her fallopian tube. The fertilised egg had implanted itself outside her womb and the embryo, at about six weeks old, could not survive but was threatening her life: Reyes was bleeding to death. Doctors delayed treatment, fearful of the repercussions of the ban on therapeutic abortions that had been introduced only months earlier, in November 2006. By the time they took Reyes for surgery it was too late. The 22-year-old law student, who had celebrated her wedding only two months earlier, suffered repeated heart attacks during the operation and died from cerebral arrest due to haemorrhaging. In a report published the same year on the banning of therapeutic abortions in Nicaragua, the rights organisation Human Rights Watch said she should have been treated immediately under government rules on ectopic pregnancies, but the contradictory new ban on therapeutic abortions meant doctors feared intervening. Only days after the law was changed, another young woman, the same age as Reyes, spent days asking for treatment from a local hospital without success. When she was transferred to another hospital it was, again, too late. She died of a cardiac arrest. The penal code Nicaragua introduced to enforce its ban included prison sentences for anyone performing abortions, as well as the women seeking them, regardless of whether their lives were in danger. It was because of this, her husband told the media, that Reyes was left bent double in agony in the hospital ward. The young women's deaths did not alter the course of Nicaraguan law. After the ban on therapeutic abortions in 2006, more amendments brought a blanket ban by 2008, with no exceptions for saving the woman's life. The morning before her death, Izabela* texted her mother from the hospital. 'The child weighs 485g. For now, because of the abortion law, I have to stay in bed and they can't do anything,' she wrote. 'They will wait for the baby to die or for something to start happening. If it doesn't then great, I can expect sepsis.' Izabela, 30, owned a hair salon in Pszczyna, a small town in Silesia. On her Instagram account Pani Iza, as she was known to customers, would regularly post photos of her influencer-worthy wedding coiffures and hair transformation. Her clients did not spare compliments. 'The best hairdresser in the world, you can see that she loves her job,' reads one of the last online reviews dated June 2021, a month before Izabela died. 'Thanks to her, I went from black to blonde and my hair survived!' When her waters broke at 22 weeks, Izabela thought it was stress. She had spent the day at hospital with her nine-year-old daughter, who had fallen from her scooter. Izabela was taken to hospital the next day, though no treatment was undertaken until the next morning. 'They can't do anything, because then it'll look like they did it on purpose,' she texted her mother, to explain why doctors were not inducing the birth hours after the waters broke. 'They have to wait for it to happen on its own. And if it doesn't, then we're waiting for the heart to stop beating,' she wrote. 'The woman is like an incubator. And the baby is suffering too - it has nothing to breathe with.' According to a Polish law introduced in 2021, abortion is legal to save the health or life of the mother and in cases where the pregnancy is a result of rape. Previously, the procedure could also be legally carried out in cases of severe foetal abnormalities. Although the doctors could have legally aborted, they chose not to until it was too late. The law that would have allowed them to do this was 'difficult to apply in practice', says Jolanta Budzowska, the lawyer representing Izabela's family in a court case against the hospital. 'If they carry out an abortion too early and the prosecutors then decide that there was no danger to the mother [at that point] they can face up to three years in prison. Consequently, doctors are more cautious in their decisions.' As doctors waited for the foetal heartbeat to stop, women on Izabela's ward recall her pleading with the staff. 'She felt that something was not right. But they kept telling her that the heart is beating, and that as long as the heart is beating this is the way it must be,' one woman told Polish media. 'I can still hear her words to this day: that she wants to live, she doesn't want to die, that she has people to live for,' the woman said. After nationwide protests, the hospital where Izabela died was fined 650,000zloty (PS120,000) by the Polish health service. The court case against the doctor responsible for Izabela during her stay at the hospital is ongoing. The hospital's director resigned in March. Manuela*, a mother of two from El Salvador, did what most people would do when she fell ill while pregnant in 2008: she went to hospital. Tragically, she miscarried, but instead of medical and social support, she was handcuffed to her hospital bed and interrogated by police. Manuela, 33, whose full name has never been made public, was charged with aggravated homicide under El Salvador's draconian anti-abortion laws, and sentenced to 30 years in prison. She died of cancer two years later - a disease that activists say was ignored and left untreated during her incarceration. 'The stories of women in El Salvador who have been unjustly criminalised for experiencing obstetric emergencies, as happened to Manuela, should also serve as a global example of the terrible consequences of criminal restrictions on access to a service such as abortion,' says Carmen Martinez, an associate director in Latin America for the Center For Reproductive Rights, a US-based human rights organisation. Last November, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR) ruled that the state was responsible for Manuela's death, having violated her rights to life, health, judicial protections and guarantees, freedom from discrimination and gender violence. The court ordered El Salvador to pay reparations to the young woman's family and to reform its strict abortion laws and healthcare policies. 'There is no doubt that Manuela suffered an obstetric emergency,' stated the landmark ruling. 'Such situations, as they are medical conditions, cannot lead to a criminal sanction.' El Salvador has some of the world's most restrictive abortion laws. Since 1998, the procedure has been banned without exception, including in cases of rape and incest. Over the past 20 years, more than 180 women have been jailed for murder for having an abortion after suffering obstetric emergencies, according to rights groups. 'I remember my mum, she gave us advice and never left us alone. It is painful to grow up without a mother because that love is incomparable,' Santos de Jesus, Manuela's eldest son, said in a statement before the hearing in March last year. 'I ask the state not to do these things because they left us abandoned without a mother.' At the time of the ruling, many women's rights activists believed that the Americas could be on the path to further liberalisation of abortion laws - and decriminalisation gains in Colombia and Argentina fuelled those hopes. However, the leak of the US supreme court's draft opinion to overturn Roe v Wade has many rights groups worried that progressive policies may remain out of reach. 'The threats to abortion rights in the US matter to all of us because it is a terrible precedent at the international level,' Martinez, one of the lawyers who argued Manuela's case before the IACHR, says. 'This does not mean that what happens in a court like the one in that country can affect the achievements we have made in El Salvador and throughout Latin America, and for which we will continue to work with more enthusiasm. 'Roe v Wade must be protected as well as all laws that have advanced in the decriminalisation of abortion in the world. The fight for our rights has no borders.' Mildred* was a 15-year-old girl from Manyani estate in the Kenyan city of Nakuru. She was admitted at the Nakuru Level 5 hospital last summer with acute abdominal pains and uncontrollable vomiting. She died writhing in pain, 20 weeks into a pregnancy she had tried and failed to end using herbs and salt. Her anguished father, David, explained that the family did not know about her pregnancy. Mildred had travelled to the family's rural home in Bungoma, where, her family believe, she tried to end the pregnancy with the help of an older woman she knew there. 'I did not know that my daughter attempted to terminate her pregnancy using a mixture of herbs, concentrated drinks and salt, a secret she kept close to her heart,' her father says. 'I wish my daughter had accessed a safer abortion ... terminating the pregnancy was a better option to her happiness than trading her life with herbs that caused her infection and painful death,' he says. At the same hospital, two years ago, Betty* died after trying to use detergent to end her pregnancy. The pain of the loss is still raw for her mother, from Racecourse estate, in Nakuru. 'I thought my daughter was suffering from malaria. She was vomiting and complained of a severe headache,' she says. Betty died on 19 May 2020 in agony. 'It is sad that my daughter suffered in silence. I would have supported and walked with her in her pregnancy journey, and guaranteed her a safe delivery,' says her mother. 'It pains me that she died such a painful death, yet I could have helped raise the baby as she continued with her studies.' Her mother claims Betty was encouraged to take the detergent by her peers for fear of being forced to drop out of school and the stigma that comes with a teenage pregnancy. Kenyan society views teenage mothers as failures, with a number being denied education and forced into early marriages, often with abusive men. 'I wish there was a way of stopping my daughter from dying,' says her mother. 'I trusted she would save me from poverty.' In Kenya, abortion is outlawed under the constitution, with the exception of pregnancy from rape, pushing women and girls into crude methods of abortions, risking their health and their lives. According to the most recent Demographic Health Survey, 35% of maternal deaths in 2014 were as a result of unsafe abortions. Dr Susan Gitau, chair of the Department of Counselling Psychology at Africa Nazarene University, says many of those who survive such unsafe procedures suffer lasting trauma. 'Psychological counselling is key, counselling that should be done within 48 hours,' she says, 'because abortion is illegal, girls do not access this.' * Names have been changed to protect identities.", "9570ebbff569269a7dbdc385389456158be87747a357bbd8ac70ff2f": "Sir John Bell, the Canadian immunologist, is a familiar sight to locals along the stretch of the Thames near his home in Wallingford, just outside Oxford, where he and his wife can often be seen rowing in a double scull. During the pandemic, Bell's voice became familiar to millions of radio listeners too. As news broke that a viable Covid-19 vaccine was on its way, following successful trials by Pfizer and BioNTech, Bell was asked on BBC Radio 4 whether the world would now return to normal. His response was an emphatic 'yes, yes, yes'. His words not only lifted spirits: they moved markets. As regius professor of medicine at the University of Oxford, and an early member of the government's vaccine taskforce who had worked on Oxford University's Covid-19 vaccine with AstraZeneca, the 69-year-old's words carried weight. Last December, he confidently predicted that Omicron was 'not the same disease we were seeing a year ago' and that high Covid death rates in the UK were 'now history'. Speaking to the Observer in a restaurant on Oxford's high street, sipping a cup of tea, Bell is still upbeat. 'The vaccines have had a very powerful and durable effect on death ... most people who have had the vaccine are completely safe,' he says. 'People dying now, since last July, are unvaccinated. That's tragic,' he adds, while acknowledging that frail elderly people and the immunocompromised are also at greater risk. Age 69 Family Married with three children. Education Attended Ridley College in St Catharines, Ontario; studied medicine at the University of Alberta, graduating in 1975; Rhodes Scholar in medicine at Oxford University; postgraduate training in London and at Stanford University. Last holiday 'So long ago I can't remember. Off to Canada this summer.' Best advice he's been given 'If you believe in something, never give up.' Biggest career mistake Trying to help modernise Oxford University by sitting on its council. Word(s) he overuses 'Terrific.' How he relaxes Rowing or sculling on the Thames, swimming in the university pool, hiking and cycling. For that reason, he says, it would be sensible to give more booster jabs in the autumn to people over 65 and those with poor immune systems, while healthy younger people, children and teenagers don't really need them - unless a more severe Covid variant emerges. 'Two things could happen: one is that the vaccines genuinely last a year or 18 months against death, or we get a variant which is much more pathogenic, in which case we need another one [vaccine],' he says. He sees a 'very high' chance that if a new variant emerges, it will be relatively mild like Omicron, while the chances of a more lethal variant are 'very low but not nothing'. The main challenge now is to come up with a jab that stops transmission of the virus, but Bell is optimistic about the second generation of Covid vaccines, which are expected to be on the market within one to two years. A nasal spray could stop transmission, he and other scientists hope, while vaccines that use T-cells to kill infected cells could offer longer-lasting immunity than current jabs and may also be better at fighting virus mutations. While there is plentiful global supply of vaccines, they remain very unevenly distributed, and many people in poorer countries have still not had a single dose. Bell is proud of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab, of which close to 3bn doses have been sold in 180 countries, and at not-for-profit pricing until late last year. However, despite being billed as a 'vaccine for the world', it was at the centre of a political controversy a year ago, with accusations over efficacy, supply and side-effects. Bell says the 'uninformed' comments made by politicians such as the French president, Emmanuel Macron, cost many lives at the time because people worried about the safety of taking the jab, in particular in Africa. Macron's comments were hyped up by social media, a campaign 'provoked by third parties' designed to cause disruption, he says. 'Imagine if you are living in [former] French West Africa and the president of France says: 'don't use this vaccine'. Imagine what you think if you're the guy on the street. Vaccine hesitancy in Africa has been driven by uninformed bad press, and the problem is no one is accountable for it.' While the AstraZeneca shot has not been approved in the US, Bell thinks it will continue to be used across the world as a booster jab, and studies have shown it to be particularly good at boosting Chinese-made Covid vaccines, in African, South American and some Asian countries. Bell, who has dual citizenship, has kept his Canadian accent. He drives a Tesla, but is regarded as pretty down-to-earth by colleagues. His former headteacher at Ridley College has described him as very humble for a man who has served several prime ministers as one of the UK's top epidemiologists. He was born into a family of scientists - his mother taught pharmacy at university while his father was a professor of haemotology and his grandfather a professor of anaesthetics. Bell studied medicine in Canada and at Oxford, before eventually becoming a regius professor in the subject (a chair originally sponsored by King Henry VIII), setting up three biotech companies and advising the UK government on its life science strategy. He misses lab-based research, he says, but 'you can't do everything'. Appointed UK life sciences champion in 2011, Bell has been advising the government on how to turbocharge the industry, which is second only to the US's in size. According to figures from the BioIndustry Association (BIA), PS4.5bn of investment poured into UK biotech last year, a 16-fold increase from 2012. 'Now that we've done Brexit, for better or worse, this is the one thing we have to do: to make ourselves a success in terms of growing new, exciting companies with exciting science-based discoveries that we then go and sell to the world.' Bell chairs Immunocore, whose treatments use the body's immune system to kill cancer. Its drugs are developed in Oxford, but it is listed on America's Nasdaq exchange, where valuations are higher. 'We have lots of startup capital but we've got no growth capital,' Bell says. 'The City of London with its great financial institutions, pension funds and insurance companies - they do not invest in private companies.' There is hope: the government wants to make it easier for pension schemes to invest in illiquid assets to improve returns for savers, and is running a consultation. If the rules are changed, he says, 'I'll be the first guy dancing in the street.'", "d1482ac17e93939e6af60bb9be584c82e8b4e348ffa7377e0047bc72": "", "ac070e5317c087664c530e3927bfacb3998871d434362a924e2e4ba3": "", "531424144daa07d9d07799734d9bff2c615553470fd4ac63f2b66f7d": "", "4884ac7dacf9e2c8de2c6e07dca2e8d5786898bb1727a95e8f0be21c": "", "0642786fb5168b3b84f402aa3aeaf5f5c4b0e117128cedc6e77c90b9": "", "be454522d39e354a3e71a06d7761dbc7f1975212ebc94a2f7bb2d6cc": "", "2614432cc04571fc06473b79f6747cd32c6424a71ec32a14a77ad77e": "", "522dcccb80c14ed5ae42f1a6ddab8b0743c553902540ca3e8560be76": "", "ad8e50525672caac3559caa6b2333504edc068614ab1ce145aa59d6f": "", "5a856a9bef66402a6778afa6bffb6e4707f54f61b6386988ad5869a6": "", "597db7a0534501ff22028b4a90f0a801489f45cc976159100a715e49": "", "763730a4393cda3f037c25bd5d32f89b62504879403a018772e4d5f6": "", "29e17e4f27c9db91f144f1f86644208987ca4c465375e54ae65491b0": "", "48e94d72c489c14282b88feb65ae5afd9b39a0fcaf9b98f55cbf1fa4": "", "b0a4f29d314408a4283661c7ab6e83f482650634d2af9a5fef99ed8f": "", "8847653df7ac7b487f3c2a0d6a02cd6f09d5d6a960f1e5013a25b13d": "", "c97ab39a3925fe558e6853bbe2654059d60064719dee915daeff86e5": "", "2bf0b595c79770cc40bb38896deaac9689a13562fe81e15d6255d9ba": "The world's most polluting companies have a moral and legal obligation to address the harms of climate change because of their role in spreading misinformation, according to an inquiry brought about by Filipino typhoon survivors. Experts say the long-awaited report published on Friday, which concludes that coal, oil, mining and cement firms engaged in 'wilful obfuscation' of climate science and obstructed efforts towards a global transition to clean energy, could add fuel to climate lawsuits around the world. The inquiry by the Philippines Commission on Human Rights began seven years ago after a petition by survivors of Typhoon Haiyan and local NGOs. As well as considering the human rights impacts of climate breakdown in the Philippines, it drew on scientific, legal and personal evidence from around the world to examine the role played by 47 of the world's most polluting companies in the climate crisis. During hearings in Manila, London and New York, the commission heard from survivors of extreme weather disasters who appealed directly to the companies to respect their human rights. It concluded that the world's most polluting companies are morally and legally liable for the impacts of the climate crisis because they have engaged in wilful obfuscation of climate science and obstructed efforts towards a global transition to clean energy. It said they may also be held to account by their shareholders for continuing to invest in oil exploration for 'largely speculative purposes'. The commission called on governments to phase out fossil fuel projects and keep new coal, oil and gas in the ground, provide incentives for renewable energy, and ensure businesses are subject to strong corporate responsibility laws. Yeb Sano, the executive director of Greenpeace Southeast Asia, which helped bring the original petition, said the report was a 'vindication' for the millions of people whose rights were being breached by the companies behind the climate crisis. 'This report is historic and sets a solid legal basis for asserting that climate-destructive business activities by fossil fuel and cement companies contribute to human rights harms. The message is clear: these corporate behemoths cannot continue to transgress human rights and put profit before people and planet.' While the commission does not have the power to hold the companies legally responsible or to fine them, experts hope the report will inform the development of new laws and lawsuits in the Philippines, and the vast body of evidence it has collected will be used by policymakers, lawyers and climate campaigners around the world. Carroll Muffett, the president and CEO of the US-based Center for International Environmental Law, described the result as a watershed moment in climate accountability that built on other recent court lawsuits, such as last year's ruling by a Dutch court that Shell had to cut its emissions by 45% by 2030. He said the commission's conclusion that states are responsible for protecting their citizens from climate-related human rights abuses by businesses 'should send shock waves through the oil industry'. The commission's chair, Roberto Eugenio Cadiz, said it had provided 'every opportunity' to companies under investigation to participate in the inquiry, even travelling to countries where many of the firms had their headquarters, but none took up the offer. Several challenged the commission's jurisdiction over them in writing and argued that climate change was not a violation of human rights. Publication of the report was repeatedly delayed, to the growing frustration of the petitioners, many of whom were also affected by the more recent Typhoon Rai, but they are glad it has finally come out. Sano said the commission set a 'courageous example' for other human rights institutions and governments around the world and called on the incoming Philippine government to adopt its findings.", "59ba556f19de051dff32509d476d41e66bbccfbcf822dca6eb256449": "Arizona water authorities are bracing for additional cuts to the quantity of water supplied by the Colorado River, prompting calls for more aggressive conservation measures to prevent further reductions. Officials in Arizona state predict that these cuts could come as soon as August, the Phoenix NBC Affiliate 12 News reported Friday. These expected cuts stem from the effects of a decades-long megadrought, which has been greatly exacerbated by the climate crisis. Moreover, the Colorado River, which provides water to almost 40 million people, has been imperiled due to decades of overuse. The river's reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, have seen worsening declines in their water levels. Arizona is typically granted 2.8m acre-feet of water from the Colorado River. The US Bureau of Reclamation, which manages water and hydropower in the south-west, declared its first water shortage in 2021; federal mandates and state-based efforts resulted in Arizona leaving 500,000 acre-feet 'behind Hoover Dam' this year, according to AZCentral.com. The Bureau of Reclamation makes mandates based on water levels in Lake Mead, which are determined by upstream disbursements from Lake Powell. The water level in Lake Powell has approached the minimum required to produce hydropower that provides electricity for several million residents, AZCentral.com said. Arizona's department of water resources, and Central Arizona Project (CAP), have insisted that the state must take further measures to save water. Tom Buschatzke, the water department's director, said that if the reclamation bureau predicts further cuts in 2023, 'there should be serious consideration by water providers to start going down that path'. 'Most of the water use is outside the home,' Ted Cooke, CAP Deputy director, reportedly said to 12 News. 'It's in the yard, it's pools, it's plants, it's lawns.' While Arizona water providers have never required residential water reductions, some city governments did curtail their own usage amid a severe dry period in 2004. Buschatzke said that if water from the Rocky Mountain snowpack does not boost the reservoirs in 2023, a more serious shortage could impact Arizona cities' water supplies. 'Look at all of those factors and it's probably time to start doing something at the homeowner level or the business level,' Buschatzke told AZCentral. 'I can't dictate that, but I might urge those folks to consider doing that.' Officials said that Arizona homeowners are not likely to see 'dry taps' anytime soon, as there have been initiatives to store unused Colorado River water in underground aquifers. However, it's possible that cities will consider tapping these reserves for outdoor purposes, which could start depleting them - without any clear path to replenishing the water, AZCentral.com reported. In addition to Arizona, potential water cuts next year could also impact Nevada and Mexico and, eventually, California. 'The gravity of the immediate situation is serious,' Buschatzke, told The Los Angeles Times. 'We expect further significant actions to reduce water use will be required.'", "b660b3eb2cb3b270e7e34ec662cc6690b3ad74114d8718ccca17ced6": "If you want to know who the world's richest man has on speed dial, then a regulatory filing on Thursday provided an insight. Elon Musk announced a score of new backers for his $44bn (PS35.6bn) Twitter takeover, including Oracle tycoon Larry Ellison, the crypto market's leading trading platform, the Qatari sovereign wealth fund and a Saudi prince. If this was Tesla's boss displaying his power network, it was also an admission that - despite recent words to the contrary - the numbers behind his audacious bid do matter. Discussing his offer last month, Musk said: 'I don't care about the economics at all.' For some of Wall Street's biggest banks, Tesla's shareholders and even Twitter users, the economics are very important indeed. The initial funding package behind the takeover, which requires shareholder approval,was initially split into three elements: $21bn in equity, or Elon Musk's own cash; $12.5bn of loans secured against Musk's shares in Tesla, the electric carmaker that he runs; and a further $13bn in loans from a group of seven banks, secured against Twitter itself. That changed on Thursday. According to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the equity commitment had risen to $27.25bn, helped by a group of 18 investors including Ellison ($1bn), the Binance trading platform ($500m) and Qatar Holding ($375m), an investment arm of the Gulf state's wealth fund. They are putting in $7.1bn, plus a contribution from the Saudi Arabian investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who also plans to roll his $1.9bn Twitter stake into the deal rather than cashing out. As part of this reshuffle, the loans secured against Musk's 15.7% stake in Tesla have been halved to $6.25bn. The bank loan commitment stays the same. Musk's comment about the economics of the bid, in an interview at a TED conference in mid-April, came before he confirmed hastily put-together funding for a takeover. It was a move that swayed shareholders in Twitter and the company's board, who accepted the bid days later. But the off-the-cuff nature of his comments belie the serious nature of the financial commitments the Tesla tycoon is making. Some experts point to a high-risk structure, regardless of last week's changes - and what it means for the company he is buying. 'Musk hasn't provided a lot of detail about his business plan for the company,' says Jill Fisch, a professor of business law at the University of Pennsylvania. 'Although he has taken steps to reduce his risk by bringing in additional investors, he still has a lot of personal exposure financially, he is paying a high price based on Twitter's existing business model and he has large loans from the banks. Given the size of Musk's personal financial exposure, he will be under pressure to run Twitter to make money, both to manage his own financial risk and to repay the bank financing.' First, let's look at Musk's commitment. Last month he revealed he had sold $8.5bn worth of shares in Tesla since announcing the takeover, presumably to help fund the deal. His stake in Tesla, which forms the core of his wealth, is integral to financing the deal. If you strip out new investors and Prince Talwaleed's stake, plus Musk's own $3.9bn stake in Twitter, he still needs to provide around $14.3bn of equity for the deal. A simple reading of this would be: he owns $155bn in Tesla shares, so contributing just over $14bn should be easy.  But it is not quite as straightforward as that. According to a filing with the SEC, Musk has already pledged 92.3m of his 163m Tesla shares as 'collateral to secure certain personal indebtedness'. Then there is the $6.25bn already pledged for the deal - in an arrangement known as a margin loan, where the borrower could be required to make good any shortfall in the value of the shares that the debt is secured against. Presuming the loan-to-value ratio of 20% in the original margin loan agreement is carried over, this means a further 35.8m shares are tied up. So, looking at Musk's total shareholding, this leaves him with about 35m unpledged shares worth $30bn. In theory, these could be pledged or sold to raise the remaining $14bn of cash needed for the deal. But Musk tweeted on 29 April that he had 'No further TSLA sales planned after today'.  Drew Pascarella, a senior lecturer of finance at Cornell University, says he would be surprised if Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street bank that has played the lead role in the debt financing, had not carried out some form of due diligence on Musk's commitment. 'There is no way Morgan Stanley would have proceeded as they did unless they had looked in Elon's eyes and seen some evidence that he could come up with that money.' The Tesla chief executive has other sources of wealth, including Tesla shares already sold, his SpaceX rocket business and his Boring Company tunnelling firm. He is also in line to receive $20bn worth of Tesla share options (based on Friday's share price), although he cannot cash these in for five years. According to calculations by CreditSights, a credit research firm, the bank financing alone will leave Twitter highly leveraged once the deal is completed. Twitter's gross indebtedness will be nine times its underlying Ebitda - a measure of profit - for 2021, says CreditSights. 'That is very high and certainly not a comfortable amount of leverage,' says Jordan Chalfin, a senior technology analyst at CreditSights. It is against the backdrop of these numbers that Musk has floated ideas such as charging a 'slight' fee for commercial and government users, although it will stay free for casual users.The New York Times also reported on Friday that Musk expects to pay down the $800m-$900m debt interest costs with free cash flow that he expects to grow to $9.4bn by 2028, although in the short term it looks like it will be tight. According to Chaflin, a proxy for Twitter's ability to cover its debt interest would be subtracting Twitter's capital expenditure costs - $1bn last year - from the company's Ebitda. Stock market analysts' forecasts for Twitter Ebitda, according to a Reuters poll, is $1.4bn in 2022 and $1.8bn in 2023. It could be a squeeze.  'The extremely high levels of debt Elon plans to saddle Twitter with come at a high price - investment for growth,' says Cornell's Pascarella. 'A technology company like Twitter needs to invest in itself to continue to innovate and grow. Post deal, most of Twitter's cash flow will be used not for investment, but to service debt.'Speaking about Twitter at a recent conference, Musk said: 'I mean, I could technically afford it.' He can, but some users might have to pay.", "34a17a45ba9e3f975e776a6adb98a042845ee9c163d90a61f53880e9": "A speech by the home secretary, Priti Patel, was disrupted on Friday evening after pro-refugee activists infiltrated a Conservative party 'spring dinner'. Eight young social justice and climate campaigners from Green New Deal Rising disrupted the Bassetlaw Conservative Association Spring Dinner and demanded she drop controversial plans to offshore asylum seekers to Rwanda. As Patel started to address the party faithful, activists stood up, one by one, to condemn the offshoring plans and called on Patel to abandon them. 'As young people wanting to live in a fair and compassionate society, we are disgusted by your treatment of refugees,' said one of the activists, as plain-clothed security personnel appeared swiftly and removed the protesters from the building. Attendees at the Conservative dinner could be heard on video footage of the incident chanting: 'Out, out, out'. The group targets politicians and other establishment figures and disrupts meetings they attend to challenge their stance on social justice and climate change issues. This tactic is becoming increasingly popular among activists. Extinction Rebellion recently disrupted HSBC's AGM singing a variation of Abba's Money, Money, Money, changing the words to 'money, money, money, it's so scummy, in HSBC's world'. Hannah Martin, from Green New Deal Rising, said: 'The plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda is inhumane and will lead to the destruction of people's lives and further harm those people who are seeking safety.' 'Those who stand for climate justice also stand against Priti Patel's cruel plans that demonise people who are escaping terrifying situations as they bear the brunt of the multiple crises of war, poverty and the climate catastrophe. We want Priti Patel to drop the dangerous Rwanda migration plan and provide support and safety for migrants, refugees and people seeking asylum.' The plans to offshore asylum seekers to Rwanda were announced on 14 April and are the subject of several legal challenges. Initially the government suggested that the first removals would take place very soon but the prime minister, Boris Johnson, has now indicated it is likely to be several months before anyone is forcibly removed to the African country. Many asylum seekers have reported being terrified of being sent to Rwanda. A Home Office spokesperson said:'The world-leading Migration Partnership will overhaul our broken asylum system, which is currently costing the UK taxpayer PS1.5bn a year - the highest amount in two decades.It means those arriving dangerously, illegally or unnecessarily can be relocated to have their asylum claims considered and, if recognised as refugees, build their lives there.'

In a written ruling, US district judge James Donato in San Francisco rejected Trump's argument that Twitter violated his right to freedom of speech guaranteed by the first amendment of the US constitution. Twitter and other social media platforms banned Trump from their services after a mob of his supporters attacked the US Capitol in a deadly riot on 6 January2021 . That assault came after a speech by Trump in which he reiterated false claims that his election loss in November was because of widespread fraud, an assertion rejected by multiple courts and state election officials. Trump's lawyers alleged in a court filing last year that Twitter 'exercises a degree of power and control over political discourse in this country that is immeasurable, historically unprecedented, and profoundly dangerous to open democratic debate'. At the time of removing Trump's account permanently, Twitter said his tweets had violated the platform's policy barring 'glorification of violence'. The company said then that Trump's tweets that led to his removal were 'highly likely' to encourage people to replicate what happened in the Capitol riots. Before he was blocked, Trump had more than 88 million followers on Twitter and used it as his social media megaphone.", "434cb632e083b0b44df445cdc6a689a36941a916fb7e03bc7c13b24a": "Spending time in the great outdoors is good for your mental health, according to a growing body of research. For example, getting out and about in forests and parks has been shown to increase happiness and alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety. But are the benefits universal? A review paper notes that most studies in this field look at rich, white, western populations, and scientists say this results in an incomplete picture of the health benefits. Carlos Andres Gallegos-Riofrio, of the University of Vermont's Gund Institute for Environment, whose findings have been published in Current Research in Environmental Sustainability, says indigenous populations like those he studies in South America have different relationships with nature to other people. He says it is important to learn how their mental health is affected by this different rapport. Gallegos-Riofro and colleagues at the University of Vermont examined 174 peer-reviewed studies from the last decade and found more than 95% of research was conducted in high-income western nations of the US, Europe and east Asia. Only 4% of studies looked at nations of medium income, such as India, and no low-income countries featured in the studies. Only one study took place in Africa and one in South America. Of the participants whose ethnicity was known, most were white. Rachelle Gould, a researcher at University of Vermont's Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources, said: 'There's nothing necessarily wrong with the existing findings, those findings are important, but we have reason to believe they may not apply to the entire population. In order to allow this work to influence sustainability action and to move us towards sustainability, we need to know which of these effects are universal and which are culturally specific.' Making this distinction can lead to fair policy changes, Gould says. The study builds on the concept of 'Weird psychology', a term coined by the evolutionary biologist Joseph Henrich. The acronym refers to how experiments that focus mainly on college students from western, educated, industrialised, rich and democratic (Weird) parts of the world cannot allow scientists to draw universal conclusions about human behaviour. 'This research strikingly demonstrates a massive bias in the sampling of global populations towards those that are Weird,' said Henrich, who was not involved in the study. 'This limits our ability to generalise about the phenomenon under investigation.' Henrich said it would be useful to expand research to include more diverse populations and use culturally sensitive tools adapted to the people being studied.", "853aedae345ec6fcba6db373136598dd82073fd61acf09e2ab8f03ac": "Sri Lanka's president has declared a state of emergency for the second time in five weeks, giving security forces sweeping powers as a nationwide strike demanding his resignation brought the country to standstill. A spokesperson for Gotabaya Rajapaksa said he invoked the tough laws to 'ensure public order' after shops closed and public transport was halted on Friday by unions blaming him for the unprecedented economic crisis, which has ignited weeks of unrest. Earlier on Friday, police used teargas and water cannon to disperse students attempting to storm the national parliament demanding Rajapaksa resign. The state of emergency gives powers to security forces to arrest and detain suspects for long periods without judicial supervision. It also allows the deployment of troops to maintain law and order in addition to police. 'The president used his executive powers to invoke emergency regulations to ensure the maintenance of essential services and public order,' the spokesperson said. He said the laws will go into effect from midnight on Friday. Rajapaksa had declared an earlier state of emergency on 1 April, a day after thousands of protesters attempted to storm his private home in the capital. That emergency was allowed to lapse on 14 April. But protests have escalated since then. The new emergency declaration came as thousands of demonstrators remained outside Rajapaksa's seafront office, where they have been protesting since 9 April, and smaller groups tried to storm homes of other key government politicians. The 85,000-strong police force had stepped up security for all ruling party legislators.

Andrew Wilhoite, 40, of Lebanon received 60 of the 276 total votes on Tuesday for Republicans for three positions on the Clinton township board, Boone county election results showed. Wilhoite was arrested in late March in connection with the death of 41-year-old Elizabeth 'Nikki' Wilhoite, whom, the authorities suspect, was killed by a blow from a gallon-sized concrete flower pot, the Indianapolis Star reports. He has been held since then in the Boone county jail without bond, charged with murder. Indiana police allege Andrew Wilhoite struck Nikki Wilhoite in the head with a blunt object, knocking her out. He then put her in a vehicle and drove to a creek a few miles from their home and dumped her body there after dropping it from a bridge, police allege. Police found Nikki Wilhoite's body on 26 March partially submerged in about three feet of water. Court records indicate Nikki Wilhoite filed for divorce on 17 March. The couple had been married for 12 years. Andrew Wilhoite's jury trial is scheduled for 29 August, court records show. If he is convicted of a felony before the 8 November general election, he would automatically be removed from the ballot. No Democrats have filed for the board.

Some had studied the video frame by frame to identify their loved one. Others knew in an instant that one of the men being murdered in the Tadamon massacre was their family member who had vanished nine long years ago. Ten days after the Guardian revealed the massacre carried out and filmed by Syrian forces in a suburb of Damascus, a fuller picture is emerging of the men who were killed, and unusually outspoken family members are demanding answers of a rattled Syrian regime - which has released a few hundred prisoners in an apparent attempt to quell the outcry. A total of six men shown in their last moments of life in the gruesome video have now been identified. Many were Palestinians from the nearby Yarmouk refugee camp. Several more were local residents. Their families have little clue about why they were captured. But for the first time since the outset of the war, officials are under pressure to provide responses to a seething Syrian street. Regime reaction so far has been to offer concessions; an amnesty law for terrorism offences that did not involve killing, an anti-torture law passed by decree, which many in Damascus feel is almost mocking them, and a new defence minister, who has no ties to the security machine accused of directing the slaughter in Tadamon. The first prisoner release did not go quite to plan, if indeed it was the regime's intent to represent a new benevolent side, when up to 20 men were dropped off from a prison truck in a central Damascus square on Tuesday. Their faces gaunt, skin pallid and eyes staring vacantly into the middle distance, the men looked like human wrecks, pale imitations of the photos held by family members who wept as they received them. All week a vigil ensued, with thousands lining the streets of the Syrian capital waiting for those incarcerated in Bashar's dungeons - in this case, the infamous Sednaya prison on the outskirts of the capital. Family members of the Tadamon victims, meanwhile, were finally able to hold vigils of their own, for men they had long believed were lost in the darkness of Sednaya. Among them were the parents of Wasim Siyam. 'I was expecting everything, that he'd have lost an eye, that he'd have been tortured, but I wasn't expecting that they do this to him, it's the absolutely worst,' his mother told the al-Araby network. 'I thought he was held by the regime. He left the house at 6am. I gave him his clothes, I had them hanging to dry, he wore them and I told him: please don't go. At 12.40 his phone dropped off the cell network. We asked the government for a family record and they had him down as alive. Justice must be served.' Siyam's father told Orient TV he recognised his son by the way he ran: 'My friend who lives in the Netherlands sent me this video and I watched it once, twice, three times and I noticed one of them ran in a familiar way and it was my son.' Siyam was 33 years old when he was murdered and had two daughters, who are now 15 and 13. His father told Orient Radio of having to tell his granddaughters. 'On Monday, on the first day of Eid ... their grandma showed [the daughters] the video and told them: this is your father. I used to lie to them and tell them that their dad was alive and working. One of them would tell me: 'OK but I just succeeded in my exams, isn't he going to come and get me a present?'' A Facebook page, Yarmouk Camp News, carried more news about Siyam. A school friend, Rami Jalbout, who is now a lawyer, said: 'He was hard-working. His grandfather owned the bakery and he used to work in it, he lived above it. He had a very special laugh and was a very kind person.' The next three victims identified were the Turkmen Syrians Shaman al-Daher and his sons, Omar and Mutlaq. Omar and Shaman were identified being executed by family members who refused to provide their names to the website Zaman al-Wasl. They also identified Mutlaq, whom they said was already dead in the pit. Shaman was 63 years old and was arrested with his sons during a raid on his house on 16 April 2013, the day of the massacre. The fifth victim identified was Louay al-Kabra, another resident of the Yarmouk refugee camp, according to the Action Group for the Palestinians of Syria. Louay was a first responder and had been reported missing earlier that month. Said Ahmad Khattab, a barber, 27, was another Palestinian victim from Yarmouk. A friend said on Twitter that he was the grandson of a leader of a 1936 Palestinian revolt against the Ergun. 'Today, 74 years after that massacre, I forced myself to watch this video ... and saw Said the grandson get executed the same way his grandfather was but this time by Arabs who claim they are resistance.' Yarmouk had been long held up by the Syrian regime as a showpiece to its commitment to the Palestinian cause. But regime raids later in 2013 forced most of its residents into exile, some for a second time. Many remain in Lebanon, afraid to return. Prof Ugur Umit Ungor, from the University of Amsterdam's Institute of Genocide and Holocaust Studies, who revealed the massacre along with his colleague, Annsar Shahhoud, said the overwhelming reaction to the revelations had left him feeling ambivalent. 'You don't want to re-traumatise people and cause more suffering, but on the other hand there's no point keeping bad news from people,' he said. 'So it's the lesser evil, that's a thin consolation but it's all I have. 'I cannot and do not want to imagine the feelings of those family members the very moment they saw the video and recognised their loved ones. I just hope this research puts an end to the horrific feeling of endless waiting for a disappeared, and hopefully they can mourn the person now.'", "bf7bbe3b43aeb00e3aae57096a327337a87ec91c63588c9bb7463cbe": "", "2417f5a7a5f56ebad194e2cfcea39bdbcaac2fe66f4581120a0dc43a": "", "50fcb3045adfdc56659b6e93a66a9abeabec8f88803f068f4e6b8744": "", "e9b18b24c3ef415ec535158f29b00544610530018b9926ae7d315eee": "", "70cd7382a2586dc25bc3e1558ee76f6b2f691b8c8817f373e478b4f9": "", "25d243687ef0e1861e1b87cb08f577f10405eb1c75ce2210d558c572": "", "e4aa81a105da682d31b5d334f66486dfdb9f0060778ac0c4a81a72f7": "Dr Tracy Dennis-Tiwary was a professor of psychology, immersed in research - evaluating which mental health treatments worked and why - when she first became aware of an uptick in anxiety. This was some 15 years ago in New York City. 'I work closely with practising clinicians and I remember one of them saying, 'I'm seeing all these parents and kids coming in and they're talking about anxiety the way we used to talk about stress,'' she says. 'Everything is about anxiety.' Back then, Dennis-Tiwary believed treatments would make a difference. 'I thought we were going to claw this back, but the opposite happened.' Instead, that uptick became an avalanche. Today, anxiety disorders are the most common mental health issues in the US, affecting 30% of adults. In the UK, prescriptions for anti-anxiety medications have almost doubled over the past 15 years, with a sharp rise among the under-25s (in the US, says Dennis-Tiwary, prescriptions have quadrupled). In 2021, a survey of 8,000 children led Oxford University Press to name anxiety as the 'word of the year'. 'It's the word on everyone's lips, the challenge of the moment,' says Dennis-Tiwary. 'We have reconfigured ourselves to think of ourselves as an anxious society. We have a million great self-help books, scientifically validated treatments; we have 30 different anti-anxiety meds but the field has not kept pace with the treatment and prevention of physical disease. None of it is sticking. 'I was part of the problem, however well-intentioned, until I started to wake up about a decade ago and began thinking, 'Wait a second. What are we saying to people?' The idea that anxiety is something to manage or eradicate, a habit to be broken, is wrong and actually doing us harm. It's literally a recipe for more anxiety.' This is the central message in Dennis-Tiwary's new book, Future Tense. She concludes that the problem isn't anxiety itself, but our beliefs about it and our attempts to avoid it, which are not only destined to fail, but also to make us weaker and more fragile. It's a vicious cycle. To help reframe anxiety as an ally not an enemy, Future Tense takes a deep dive into the emotion itself. 'Anxiety is very different to fear,' says Dennis-Tiwary. 'Fear is the certainty that something bad is happening to you. Anxiety is about uncertainty; it's the feeling that something bad could happen, but might not. It's the discrepancy between where you are and where you want to be.' So you're anxious about failing your exams. About that lump. Finding your first job. 'Anxiety is designed to feel bad - your heart races, your blood vessels contract - so you sit up and listen,' she says. 'But unlike fear, anxiety contains hope. Our dopamine levels increase - that's the feelgood hormone that happens when we're rewarded.' The distant prospect of acing those exams, of getting a clean bill of health or landing your chosen career is the dopamine talking. Anxiety can focus the mind, drive you to revise harder, to see a doctor, to seek new pathways towards your chosen career. 'It's a horrible emotion, it feels terrible,' says Dennis-Tiwary. 'But it's a beautiful emotion, too.' The key distinction between anxiety and an anxiety disorder is functional impairment - when our ways of coping impede on normal life. Perhaps we stop leaving the house. In cases of obsessive compulsive disorder, we might create rituals to dampen the feelings. Dennis-Tiwary advocates treatments like exposure and response prevention, a cognitive behavioural therapy, which helps patients confront whatever they are anxious about. But her biggest wish is to change our approach at a much earlier stage so that anxiety won't drift into a disorder. 'First, it's the understanding that being anxious is not a malfunction, it's helpful and useful,' says Dennis-Tiwary. 'If you wake up with that feeling, it's worth tuning in and sitting on it for a while. Why are you feeling like this?' She gives the example of her first pregnancy when she learned that her son would require open-heart surgery within months of his birth. Her anxiety was off the scale, but it energised her to do everything in her power to minimise the odds of the worst outcome imaginable. She gathered knowledge from every paper ever published about her son's condition, she found the best possible surgeon, she planned for every contingency. Anxiety helps us forge forwards with creative solutions, but there are times when there is little we can do to address a future uncertainty. Dennis-Tiwary suggests many ways of coping here. Connecting with friends and family is a soothing first step. Cultivating things that immerse you in the present moment is also helpful. 'Mindfulness is one technique, but whatever works for you. Exercise is an incredible way to find flow and bring yourself to the present. Music - whether you perform or listen to it. Walking in nature. I love to write poetry - bad poetry most of the time but it leads me to a state of expansive thinking.' Making a daily to-do list can claw back some sense of control and achievement. The worst possible response is to instead stamp out the feeling or attempt to avoid it. Humans, says Dennis-Tiwary, are 'anti-fragile' - we only strengthen and grow when challenged. 'Our emotional systems are like our immune systems,' she says. 'If our immune system isn't exposed to germs, it remains weak. If our muscles aren't used, atrophy sets in. It's only by feeling our anxiety, listening and acting on it that we cope better next time.' For this reason, Dennis-Tiwary expresses grave concerns over our creeping collective anxiety-avoidance techniques like safe spaces and trigger warnings. 'I think they're counter-productive and so far, the evidence suggests that, too,' she says. 'What they tend to do is inform someone that they're not up to the task and that difficult emotions are harmful.' Snow-plough parenting is another counter-productive development. 'Here in Manhattan, it has replaced the helicopter parent,' says Dennis-Tiwary. 'This removal of obstacles, fixing things before they've happened. I know it's so hard being a parent - it takes everything for me not to step in - but we have to have faith in our kids, acknowledge their emotions, show we have confidence they can figure it out. We need to help them through, not around.' This speaks to me. In 2020, my youngest daughter was the target of some harmful behaviour at her school. She came off her phone. She cut contact with her peers. Within weeks, the schools had closed, too, the country in lockdown and my daughter's anxiety over ever going back or making new friends was sky high. I was so tempted to lift that weight off her back by telling her she never had to. I came close. I thought about moving house. I enquired about other schools. I researched home schooling. But then what? At some point, she'd have to step back into the world. The kids from her school lived all around us. On social media, they'd never be more than a click away. I knew that the best outcome was the hardest - to go back. Strangely, in the months that followed, my daughter used many of the methods outlined in Future Tense. She filled notebooks with lists that she carefully ticked off each day. At first they were basic - 'shower', 'wash hair' - but as she began to follow interests and find meaningful distractions (teenagers without phones have a lot of hours to fill), they became more character-building. 'Meditate'', 'French Duolingo', 'Leg workout with weights.' My own anxieties brought some horrible physical effects - loss of appetite, my clothes stopped fitting - but my mind whirled with ideas, new ways to build her up. Some actually worked. She attended a film course, where she bonded with a girl over a shared interest (still one of her closest friends). Though we weren't going on holiday that summer, I asked a family in Madrid if they knew a teenage girl interested in a fortnight's exchange. My daughter returned from that trip the happiest and most relaxed I'd seen her. At school, it probably took a full year before my daughter felt safe in new friendships. Anxiety brought her to rock bottom, but by sitting with it, getting through not around, she's deeper, stronger and so much wiser. I couldn't be prouder. Like Dennis-Tiwary says, it's horrible, it feels terrible - but it's beautiful, too.

Temperatures peaked at 49C in Jacobabad, Pakistan on 30 April, with a high of 47.2C observed in Banda, India. The Indian Meteorological Department confirmed that average temperatures in April were the highest for northern and central parts of the country since records began over 100 years ago. Heatwaves are a common occurrence at this time of year in India and Pakistan, but scientists believe the intensity, duration and arrival time of the conditions witnessed so far this year are caused by rising global temperatures. Despite a slight respite in the extreme heat over the past few days, temperatures are set to intensify once more this weekend and into next week with maximum temperatures expected to approach 50C in parts of north-west India and Pakistan. In stark contrast to intense heat across northern India and Pakistan, tropical parts of south-east Asia have seen unusually low temperatures for the time of year. On 2 May, the Hong Kong Observatory reached 16.4C. This was the lowest May temperature recorded since 1917, and broke the previous record set in 2013. The southern Chinese city of Guangzhou observed a temperature of just 13.7C on the same day, the lowest temperature ever recorded during May. On 4 May, a minimum temperature of 13.6C was also recorded in the Umphang district, Thailand. This is the lowest temperature ever recorded in May in Thailand. The cool weather was a result of a north-east monsoon and unsettled conditions, but these low temperatures won't come as any consolation to northern India and Pakistan with dangerous temperatures expected to return over the coming days. Meanwhile, Australia has seen its first cold outbreak of the year after the seventh warmest April on record. A cold front brought a significant drop in temperature to south-eastern parts of the country on Wednesday with temperatures 4-8C below the average for parts of South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania. Heavy rain and strong winds affected Tasmania on Thursday and Friday thanks to a deep area of low pressure. Referred to as an 'east coast low' by meteorologists, these features occur several times a year and can bring some of the most destructive weather conditions, including heavy rain, strong winds and flash flooding.", "0b07356baa958f93f77a9157d8699af0fdb82b9f2615e7ec94bfc4b5": "As Maurice Lewis was granted his freedom at the end of last year, he wept before a judge. 'God bless you,' he told her. 'I'll never do this again. Thank you for putting me back with my family.' Lewis, a 57-year-old man, had been sentenced to life without parole in 1998. He had spent the last 23 years at Angola prison, serving his punishment by laboring on the fields, sweeping the prison hospital wards, and cleaning toilets at Louisiana's state legislature. Life without parole is a sentence so harsh, it is associated with heinous crimes. But not in Louisiana, the most incarcerated state in the world's most incarcerated country. Lewis's crime had been so banal it has never been written about before. He was sentenced in an almost empty courtroom, with no family members present, at the end of a hearing that lasted a few minutes. He had been convicted of stealing $20 in cash from a snatched purse. 'It felt like it was me against the world,' he remembered in an interview. 'They kept on digging over my past.' That the money was returned to the unharmed white woman within minutes of the crime did not matter. Under the state's habitual offender laws, voraciously enforced by the Orleans parish district attorney's office at the time, he had been branded a career criminal. And as this was the third time the state invoked the habitual offender law, he was mandatorily sentenced to life with no chance of release. A glance at Lewis's prior record reveals no career criminal, but a life of struggle instead. He had left school at the age of 14 without learning to read and had taken a few low-paying jobs - delivering newspapers, and dish cleaning at a local hotel to support his mother. His youth had been punctuated by a series of convictions for minor crimes in which no one was physically hurt and a grand total of $44 was taken and later returned. He was involved in the theft of some stereo equipment aged 19. A purse at the age of 21. And at 27, he took an umbrella from a front porch. It was, he recalled, raining that day. Lewis was convicted of burgling an inhabited dwelling and sentenced to 80 months in prison. Using his prior record, the city of New Orleans deemed that Maurice Lewis should die in prison after the final purse snatching offense in 1998, in which he had pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors described him at trial as 'a predator', a racist trope. At the end of September last year, Lewis became one of the first 128 people given back their freedom thanks to a new civil rights division in the Orleans parish district attorney's office. The division was created by the city's new district attorney, Jason Williams, who ran as a progressive reformer and pledged never to use Louisiana's habitual offender statute again. Part of his new civil rights division's work to address past harms has been to revisit excessive sentences. It has since relitigated 82 habitual offender cases, resulting in their sentence enhancement or 'multi-bills' being amended or revoked, and leading to immediate release from prison. Overuse of Louisiana's habitual offender law is seen by many reform advocates as one of the major drivers of mass incarceration in the state. The act automatically increases prison time (from a second felony conviction onwards) and significantly removes the discretion of judges. Their implementation was memorably derided by Louisiana's former supreme court chief justice, Bernette Johnson, in a 2020 dissent after the court denied a request to review the sentence of a man named Fair Wayne Bryant who was sent away for life for the attempted theft of a pair of hedge clippers. Judge Johnson described the law's usage as a 'modern manifestation' of 19th-century Pig Laws, racist statutes designed to criminalize Black people implemented shortly after the US civil war. Nowhere in the state were they as readily enforced as in New Orleans, where prosecutors used them routinely for decades, first at the instruction of former DA Harry Connick and continuing into the tenure of Leon Cannizzaro. Although in recent years the Louisiana state legislature has amended the laws to reduce mandatory sentences and later made it harder for prosecutors to enforce them as vigorously as before, there are still hundreds of people incarcerated, with their sentences enhanced by multi-billing. At the beginning of 2021, at least 718 people from Orleans parish were still incarcerated under sentences extended by the habitual offender statute. Ninety-three per cent of them are Black. In a monumental shift, the DA's office is now working with attorneys in the public defender's office and other non-profit defense groups to sift through the hundreds of names, considering each individually for re-examination on a range of criteria. These include whether the defendant was a juvenile at the time of the offense, if the offense was categorized as non-violent or no violence occurred, if the conviction was secured by a non-unanimous jury or if the defendant had been offered a more favorable plea before trial. During a recent meeting of the civil rights division, Cormac Boyle, one of only two trial attorneys assigned to the unit in its first year, began reading from an extensive list of cases they were preparing to take back to court. It was a sobering monologue:  Life without parole for a non-violent car theft.  60 years for possession with intention to distribute 2.4 grams of cocaine.  20 years for theft of a motorized dirt bike.  40 years for purse snatching. (The man, sentenced in 1986, had almost completed his sentence in full.) The list drew occasional gasps from the assembled attorneys and investigators. Some, like Boyle, have worked for years on similar cases, but the sheer volume of severity has remained striking to almost everyone. 'I get so frustrated by the utter wastage that we see of human life with the kind of sentencing that we are dealing with,' said Emily Maw, chief of the civil rights division. 'It is futile.' A few weeks after his release, Maurice Lewis was struggling. He had been overjoyed as he came out and saw his sister and brother at the gates of Angola waiting to greet him. But the realities of life outside grew day by day. grew  Every relitigated multi-bill case includes a re-entry plan for a defendant's release. But plans do not always become reality. Decades of trauma do not simply wash away. Lewis had first taken up work at a local restaurant, cleaning pots and pans in the kitchen, but, he said, was laid off when his boss found out about his criminal record. Afterwards he had tried to find work downtown, in the bustling tourist hubs on Canal Street. He walked into a number of storefronts asking for a job. The old hotel he'd worked at in the 1980s. A Footlocker. No luck. Lewis had effectively spent his entire adult life incarcerated and the realities of the free world were difficult to adapt to. He had never used a mobile phone. He had no bank account. No driver's license or state ID. He met with family members; aunts and uncles, nieces or nephews who had grown old or grown up during his decades behind bars. It was a confronting reality. He was living with his younger brother Eugene in a small apartment block, but with little space, he was sleeping in the living room. Every morning he woke up facing a life-sized photograph of his mother, Alise, who had died while he was in prison. 'I couldn't even be there to look down on my mama,' he said one recent blustery afternoon. 'Right now, today, it still messes with me.' On some nights, when it got too much, he had wandered the streets alone and slept outside under a bridge. On one occasion, he described being pulled over by police and asked for identification documents that he didn't have. 'At night time it's dangerous,' he said, his deep baritone voice at odds with his slim, slight frame. 'Anything can happen to you.' In conversations, he offered fragments of the abuse he experienced inside: of violence he witnessed, men beaten with padlocks wrapped in socks in the dorms, of a time he recalled being placed in restraints after a breakdown following the death of his mother. 'I just thank God for the blessing, you know? For putting me back out here,' he said one evening in late winter as he ate dinner in the city's French Quarter. 'What they did to me was wrong, using my past record. And I'm just trying ... trying to make it right.' Former New Orleans district attorney Harry Connick, now 96, forcefully defended his office's routine use of the habitual offender laws, arguing it was his experience as a defense lawyer that guided his usage of the statute. 'I represented them [multiple offenders] for years, and I know them,' he said, during an interview. 'I know their criminal histories, and I know that if you give them a year, they come out, they'll go and commit more crime. Give them five years and they come out, they're going to go commit more crimes. That's what they do.' Connick pointed to his office's creation of a diversion program, which deferred prosecution of first-time non-violent offenders, as an effort to steer defendants away from punitive measures. But did he recognize that many of those he was prosecuting under the statute, like Maurice Lewis, were involved in crimes born of poverty and desperation? 'Desperate for what?' He said. 'Money? ... I'm not a social worker. And my job was to prosecute.' 'People used to complain about the number of people I was sending to Angola. I would tell them to stop committing crimes, and I'll stop prosecuting them.' He added: 'For every year that individual, that habitual offender, that career criminal, would spend in the penitentiary, that diminishes the number of crimes that he's going to commit. If you get enough of them in, you're going to help your crime rate tremendously.' Despite Connick's claims, the crime rate in New Orleans soared throughout the 1990s, with experts pointing to a complex mixture of societal forces felt acutely in the city. These include multidimensional poverty, income inequality and the effects of mass incarceration itself. Jason Williams would point to these causes on repeat during his 2020 election campaign. In an interview, he cited his family's experiences with racism and the criminal justice system as a major factor in shaping his views on fair prosecution. Williams's mother grew up in Bogalusa in central Louisiana, a hotbed of KKK activity during the civil rights era. His great uncles were part of the Deacons for Defense and Justice, an armed Black self-defense group that was founded in the town. 'Growing up, I'd see them work on cars and tend to chickens in the yard,' he remembered. 'They just looked like men in overalls. I never thought about them as defenders of anything. 'It painted this picture for me that people who fight for things don't necessarily look a certain way. They don't necessarily get the credit. No sign or marker. Sometimes you've just gotta fight for what's right and go back to raising your family.' Williams was born in New Orleans but moved to Atlanta for much of his youth. He would return to the city in summers and hear stories from his cousins, living in New Orleans's Lower Ninth Ward, of police brutality and unfair arrests. He returned to New Orleans for college, and upon graduation quickly became a star of the criminal defense world and later the city council president. His unexpected victory in the 2020 DA's race shook the city's establishment, but he has since faced criticism on both sides of the political aisle. On the right, he has taken significant blame for rising violent crime rates, which began a year before he assumed office, but continued into 2021 when the city's murder tally rose to 218, the highest since Hurricane Katrina. His office has also been under fire for charging delays, which have led to higher rates of jail release for violent crime suspects. On the left, both his rhetorical and policy response to the crime wave has been seen as a reversal of a number of campaign pledges. Earlier this year, Williams introduced bail bond scheduling, despite pledging progressive reforms to how the office handled cash bail - another major driver of mass incarceration. Following a spate of carjackings, Williams's office has moved to prosecute carjackings as armed robberies meaning longer prison terms. And despite pledging to never prosecute juveniles as adults, Williams indicted two - 15-year-olds for second-degree murder in adult court, following a brutal shooting in the city. It was, he said in a recent interview, one of the hardest decisions he has had to make in office. In the same exchange, Williams reiterated his pledge never to use the habitual offender statute again, and maintained his longstanding criticism of his predecessor's use of it. But, he added: 'When you talk about violent crime, when I ran, I didn't run as a prison abolitionist. There are some people that need jail time. And the jail time should be the appropriate number to hold that person accountable for the harm they cause.' Pointing to his critics on the right who have attempted to associate his tenure with a rise in violent crime, Williams said: 'They would rather blame a reform-minded DA who wanted to make the office more fair. If I took office and I was doing everything the same way as my predecessors I still think there'd be a bit of a double standard. 'I think there are certain folks who are uncomfortable with the fact that the chief prosecutor in a southern state is a dark brown man.' On a bright Sunday morning in spring Maurice Lewis sat in church, his head bent in prayer and his right arm lifted to the heavens. He had come to worship at the Next Generation Original Morning Star, in a congregation made up mostly of formerly incarcerated people. It was his first Sunday service since release. Pastor Tyrone Smith led the worshippers in a rendition of Amazing Grace. It soared to the rafters and had the congregation swaying in time. It reminded Lewis of his mother again. The hymn had been played at her funeral, which he could not attend. Pastor Smith, himself formerly incarcerated, is co-director of the First 72+, a non-profit organization that assists people with re-entry. Lewis had received some assistance from the group, but even now, four months after release, he was struggling to navigate the complex bureaucracy to regain some of the documentation he required to claim income assistance or apply for jobs. There is little to no state assistance for those leaving prison in Louisiana, meaning non-profits like the First 72+ and individual family members shoulder much of the burden assisting those who re-enter society. 'As a country we fail with the whole criminal legal system,' said Jene O'Keefe Trigg, the civil rights division's director of partnerships and development. 'We just completely rip families apart and lock them away from their homes and their families, and then don't give them anything to come home to. It's just such an utter failure, that means we have to do more on the back end.' At the end of last year the division secured a $1m federal grant to assess and bolster re-entry services in the city. 'I think we [the prosecutor's office] have a moral obligation to ensure that New Orleans has as robust of a re-entry landscape as possible because we are rectifying these cases and bringing more people home.' Lewis has tried to remain optimistic ever since his release and drew strength from the hour of church. He aspired to work in a local hospital, a cleaning job perhaps, anywhere surrounded by people, where he could contribute. 'What the man up above did for me, he got that life sentence off me,' he said. 'I just want to press on. Put it to the side. If I don't take it and put it to the side, I'm going back to somewhere I don't want to go. 'He's the reason I'm out here now. He sees me. I'm not invisible.'

Republicans have been heavily favored to retake control of the House and probably the Senate as well, but the court's forthcoming final opinion in the crucial Mississippi case now before it, Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization, could alter those predictions. Since the court's draft opinion leaked on Monday night, vulnerable Democrats have made a point to portray themselves as champions of abortion rights. 'My opponent says that overturning Roe v Wade and ending protections for a woman's right to choose is a 'historic victory',' Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democratic senator who is up for re-election in the swing state of Nevada, said on Tuesday. 'I trust women and their doctors to make the healthcare decisions that are best for them - not politicians.' Speaking to reporters on a Thursday press call, Jaime Harrison, chair of the Democratic National Committee, argued that abortion rights will become a critical issue in the November midterms if the 1973 landmark decision in the Roe case is overturned. 'The Republican attacks on abortion access, their attacks on birth control and women's healthcare - these things have dramatically escalated the stakes of the 2022 election,' Harrison said. 'In November, we must elect Democrats who will serve as the last lines of defense against the GOP's assault on our established and fundamental freedoms.' But Republicans have insisted that issues such as record-high inflation and Joe Biden's handling of the US-Mexican border will weigh far more heavily on voters' minds in November. 'Could be wrong, but I'd predict that all those issues that have 60% of Americans [feeling] we are on the wrong track (high inflation, rising crime, the border, etc.) will play a bigger role in the elections [than] a Supreme Court decision on Roe,' Republican strategist Doug Heye said on Twitter. Rather than celebrating the news of Roe's likely demise, Republican leaders have mostly tried to focus on the leak itself, saying it represents a break in court decorum and blaming the incident on Democrats. (It is not known who leaked the draft opinion.) Asked about the court's provisional decision on Tuesday, the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, told reporters: 'You need, it seems to me, a lecture to concentrate on what the news is today. Not a leaked draft, but the fact that the draft was leaked.' Even the de facto leader of the Republican party, Donald Trump, has been hesitant to address the content of the court's decision. The normally verbose former president has not yet released a statement about the draft opinion, although he has commented on the leak when asked by reporters. 'Nobody knows what exactly it represents, if that's going to be it,' Trump told Politico on Wednesday. 'I think the one thing that really is so horrible is the leaking ... for the court and for the country.' Trump's reluctance to address the draft opinion is even more notable considering his three supreme court nominees - Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett - all initially voted to overturn Roe, according to the leaked provisional opinion published on Monday night. The former president also promised during his 2016 campaign to select supreme court nominees who would help reverse the landmark 1973 case. Now Republicans stand on the precipice of achieving their decades-long goal, and many of them seem hesitant to declare victory. However, some Republican primary candidates are using the draft opinion to draw a contrast between themselves and their opponents. David Perdue, the Trump-endorsed gubernatorial candidate in Georgia, condemned Governor Brian Kemp's 'bureaucratic response' to the news of Roe's likely reversal. 'I'm calling on Brian Kemp to join me in calling for an immediate special session of the legislature to ban abortion in Georgia after Roe v Wade is overturned,' Perdue said on Thursday. 'You are either going to fight for the sanctity of life or you're not.' Perdue and Kemp will face off in the Georgia gubernatorial primary later this month, providing an early test of how Republican voters feel about the looming end of Roe. But other Americans' thoughts about the matter will not be fully known until November. Meanwhile, new metal barriers went up in front of the marble steps and columns of the majestic supreme court building in Washington DC, close to the US Capitol, this week, a stark symbol of the sudden politicization of the court that has always preferred to keep itself above the partisan fray. This came after fierce protests erupted there within minutes of the leak on Monday, with police separating protesters in rival camps the following day. Now law enforcement officials in many places across the US are braced for potential civil unrest and women's rights groups are planning massive protests in several cities for next weekend to demand the protection of the right to choose in reproductive healthcare.", "0582e6178e920aef3cabeb144bc3d5c096dfe671f143afada9f2fc80": "It was described as the Mona Lisa of the digital world and it came with a connoisseur's price tag: $2.9m (PS2.4m) for the first tweet by Twitter's co-founder. This was March 2021 and non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, were bursting into the mainstream. One year on, an attempt to sell on Jack Dorsey's Twitter debut for $25m was pulled after auction bids topped out at just $14,000 (PS11,350). Explosive growth of NFTs over the past 12 months has levelled off, and may even be in decline, according to analysis of the sector, as attention consolidates around a few of the largest players. The NFT rush in 2021 saw sale after sale of the novel digital assets hit staggering sums. A collection of images by the visual artist Beeple sold for $69m, the main token for the 'play to earn' video game Axie Infinity hit a total value of $9.75bn and Coca-Cola raised more than $575,000 from selling items such as a customised jacket to be worn in the metaverse. The football industry, with former Chelsea star John Terry to the fore, has not been slow to back the craze either. The Dorsey NFT was put up for auction in April by its owner, the cryptocurrency entrepreneur Sina Estavi, who said: 'This NFT is not just a tweet, this is the Mona Lisa of the digital world.' Estavi hoped to raise more than $25m from the sale and offered to donate half his takings to charity. When bids reached just $14,000, he pulled the auction entirely. Non-fungible tokens are so-called because, unlike similar technologies such as bitcoin and ethereum, each is in some way unique. That means that they can be applied to more than just simple currency-style uses, and in the past few years NFTs have been adopted by people seeking to turn art, music, games and trading cards into digital assets. NFTs use a blockchain - the decentralised ledger first used by bitcoin to track ownership of the cryptocurrency - to record who owns them and allow them to be traded or modified. But most are based on the ethereum blockchain, which is maintained through an extremely carbon-intensive system called proof of work. A report published this week by Chainalysis, a blockchain data firm, said collectors have spent $37bn this year up to 1 May, putting them on track to beat the $40bn spent in 2021. However, it said that the 'explosive' growth of the NFT market last year had 'levelled off', with a sharp dip in transactions since February. In other words, the monthly spend on NFTs is no longer rising in leaps and bounds, when it started to take off in the middle of last year. Chainalysis said transaction growth had come in 'fits and starts' since last summer except for two big spikes: the release of Yuga Labs' Mutant Ape Yacht Club collection in August 2021; and a surge in late January this year, likely to have been driven by the LooksRare NFT marketplace. Other beneficiaries of the boom have seen their value collapse during the past few months. Axie Infinity, for instance, was the flagship example of the 'play to earn' sector in gaming. Players could spend thousands of dollars on a Pokemon-style virtual pet, and then play games to win tokens that could be traded for real cash. At its peak, the game redistributed enough money to in effect pay the wages of thousands of players in the Philippines, but as new players dried up, the value of its token - and the rewards - crashed, bringing the market cap of the organisation from $10bn in November to less than $2bn now. A $500m hack in March, attributed to North Korean state-sponsored attackers, has not helped. But some NFT projects have thrived. The most prominent, such as Yuga Labs' Bored Ape Social Club or Proof Collective's Moonbirds, serve as signifiers of membership to an exclusive club of holders, and as the industry has consolidated around a few large players, interest in their releases has skyrocketed. When Yuga Labs released its most recent NFT, a set of 55,000 'otherdeeds' representing ownership of virtual land in a forthcoming videogame, the rush to buy the PS5,000 tokens was so high that the ethereum blockchain was overwhelmed. Transaction fees shot up to more than PS2,500 a trade, affecting not only those trying (and in some cases failing) to buy the otherdeeds, but also anyone else trying to use the ethereum blockchain at the same time. One unrelated trade saw a $25 NFT sold in a transaction that cost more than $3,000 to execute. Ethan McMahon, economist at Chainalysis said: 'The 'blue chip' names like Bored Ape Yacht Club have more price stability than new entrants that may get hot and then fizzle out. I would only caveat this by saying that this isn't new in this space: to date, a select group of popular collections have been the ones to receive the vast majority of activity and, generally speaking, most collections never take off.' The decentralised nature of the NFT market means there are even disputes about the nature of the crash at all. While specific NFTs have lost millions of dollars of value, the health of the industry as a whole depends on who you ask. Tom Schmidt, a cryptocurrency investor, cited data from OpenSea, an NFT marketplace, to argue that monthly sales were only slightly down from a peak in January, while a report from cryptocurrency analysts Kraken suggests that the daily transaction volume on Opensea peaked in September and has halved in the months since. Despite the digital Mona Lisa losing its lustre, NFTs remain a multibillion dollar market.", "079d91cae57a67720037a9353d9d0660c48e04b1a069126c3953b66a": "", "e99c8a285b2d6f6d8901946c41c990ecceffd382d6df69dcd7661683": "The UN Security Council has issued its first statement on the war in Ukraine, but withheld from using the words 'war', 'conflict' or 'invasion'.

Thank you for following our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This blog has now closed. You can find our latest coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war in our new live blog in the link below. The UK will exempt Ukraine from its ban on providing public support for fossil fuel energy overseas as ministers look to make sure services can continue to operate during the protracted conflict. Business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the energy-related announcements were part of policies aimed at 'ramping up' support for Kyiv, according to a report from PA Media. Officials said Ukraine and other parts of eastern Europe would benefit from time-limited exemptions to the UK government's international fossil fuel support policy to ensure Britain can join global efforts to keep the embattled country's energy supplies topped up. The policy prevents the UK providing any new direct financial or promotional support for the fossil fuel energy sector overseas but ministers argued that exempting Ukraine would allow London to address the energy security impact of the conflict and quickly respond to requests for assistance. A senior official from the Russian parliament said Friday that Russia will remain in southern Ukraine 'forever', speaking on a visit to the Moscow-controlled city of Kherson, AFP reports. 'Russia is here forever. There should be no doubt about this. There will be no return to the past,' Andrey Turchak said, according to a statement from the ruling United Russia party. 'We will live together, develop this rich region, rich in historical heritage, rich in the people who live here,' Turchak added. Turchak also announced the opening of humanitarian aid centre in Kherson, for the delivery of food, medicine and essentials. It is the first time a senior Russian official indicated Moscow's intentions to remain present on Ukrainian territory. Kherson was the first major city to fall to Russian forces after the start of their military operation in Ukraine on 24 February. Over 40 Ukrainian soldiers and civilians captured by Russia, among them 11 women and a cleric, have been freed in a new prisoner exchange, Kyiv said Friday. 'Another prisoner exchange has taken place: 41 people, including 11 women were brought home,' Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in a statement on Telegram. Among those released were 28 soldiers and 13 civilians, one of whom was a member of the clergy of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. She did not say how many Russians were released in exchange. Here are some of the latest images to come out of Ukraine today. US President Joe Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, in a phone call on Friday, underscored their commitment to holding Russia accountable for its invasion of Ukraine and discussed efforts to provide security assistance to Ukraine, the White House said in a statement. Biden and Trudeau also discussed their upcoming participation in the Summit of the Americas in June in Los Angeles, it added. Here is a little more detail on the scheduled G7 meeting set to take place on Sunday.  The Group of Seven (G7) leaders including US President Joe Biden will hold a video call on Sunday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a show of unity the day before Russia marks its Victory Day holiday, the White House said. Talks will focus on the latest developments in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, efforts to bolster the country and ways to demonstrate 'continued G7 unity in our collective response, including by imposing severe costs for Putin's war,' a spokesperson for the White House's National Security Council said on Monday. The leaders of the G7 countries, which include the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Canada and Italy, will hold their virtual meeting with Zelenskiy on Sunday in the US morning, the spokesperson added. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One as Biden flew to Ohio for the day, Psaki said the timing of the session was significant because it will take place a day before Putin participates in Victory Day. The holiday on Monday marks the end of World War Two and includes military parades across Russia. Psaki also said US officials are discussing imposing more sanctions on Russian oligarchs and companies as well as taking steps to avoid Russians previously sanctioned from evading them. 'I'll be speaking with the members of the G7 this week about what we're going to do or not do,' Biden told reporters this week. It is approaching 5am in Kyiv. Here is where things stand: The UK government has said it will give Ukraine 287 mobile generators in addition to 569 generators it had donated earlier. The new generators, which are enough to power nearly 8,000 homes, will be used for hospitals, shelters and other essential services in the face of ongoing destruction in eastern Ukraine, the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy said in a statement on Saturday as reported by Reuters. The government has also relaxed rules on support for overseas fossil fuels to boost supply of vital energy to Ukraine, the statement added. US First Lady Jill Biden arrived in eastern Europe on a four-day trip on Friday intended to reaffirm the US commitment to Ukraine. Biden will meet national leaders and US troops, as well as displaced Ukrainian parents, children, educators and aid workers in Romania and Slovakia. She began her visit by greeting and serving food to troops stationed at a Romanian air base. On Sunday, she is expected to spend Mother's Day with refugee mothers and their children in Kosice, a border city in eastern Slovakia. 'On my way to Romania and Slovakia to spend Mother's Day with Ukrainian mothers and children who were forced to flee their homes because of Putin's war,' Biden tweeted on Friday. 'I will also visit US troops and express gratitude for the relief efforts of neighbouring countries and aid workers.' Here is a little more detail on US officials deflecting questions that US intelligence helped Ukraine kill top Russian generals and sink the Moskva missile cruiser. The US defence department's spokesperson, John Kirby, held a press conference on Friday where he was asked about reports that the Pentagon has provided information with Ukrainian leaders to help them target and kill Russian generals. Kirby would not corroborate the reports, instead saying Ukraine 'makes the decisions' when it comes to how they use US intel and emphasising the importance of being careful when discussing intelligence-sharing with other countries. Kirby told reporters: The Pentagon spokesperson also emphasised that other countries have provided Ukraine with information on Russian troop movements: Kirby also stressed that Ukraine combines intelligence from many countries and the US is 'not the sole source of intelligence and information to the Ukrainians'. Ukraine's president Zelenskiy has accused Russia of 'outright nuclear blackmail' during a speech to Chatham House, the international affairs think tank. Zelenskiy outlined Russia's 'contempt for all international conventions' and what he claimed to be a sense of impunity. 'Why is Russia doing all this? Because they think that if they can be held responsible for such crimes, criminal actions, it will be decades later,' he added. 'They simply do not believe that the international community can hold those responsible for the war crimes to justice as they are hiding behind the nuclear force.' Zelenskiy continued: The latest US military aid package to Ukraine, announced by president Joe Biden on Friday, is worth $150m, secretary of state Antony Blinken confirmed.  The latest tranche of assistance includes 25,000 155mm artillery rounds, as well as counter-artillery radars, jamming equipment, field equipment and spare parts. 'US support, together with the contributions of our Allies and partners, has been critical in helping Ukraine win the battle of Kyiv and hinder Putin's war aims in Ukraine,' he added. With the latest $150m US security aid package to Ukraine, Washington's military assistance to Kyiv since the Russian invasion began has reached around $3.8bn, Blinken said. Evacuation operations are continuing from the besieged southern city of Mariupol with 40 civilians rescued on Friday, Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskiy confirmed in his latest national address  The UN Security Council has issued its first statement on the war in Ukraine, but withheld from using the words 'war', 'conflict' or 'invasion'. The statement instead 'expresses deep concern regarding the maintenance of peace and security of Ukraine' and voiced 'strong support' for Secretary General Antonio Guterres in seeking a peaceful solution to the 'dispute'. 'The Security Council expresses deep concern regarding the maintenance of peace and security of Ukraine,' it reads.'The Security Council recalls that all Member States have undertaken, under the Charter of the United Nations, the obligation to settle their international disputes by peaceful means.''The Security Council expresses strong support for the efforts of the Secretary-General in the search for a peaceful solution. Wielding veto power in the council, Russia has stymied all prior bids to adopt a statement on Ukraine. Mexico's UN ambassador, whose country helped draft the statement, was asked about criticism that it took two months to draft and merely supports the UN secretary general.  Juan Ramon De La Fuente told the Associated Press there has to be a start somewhere and is 'a very first initial step but it points on the right direction'. That's it for me today but our coverage will continue with Samantha Lock. Here's what happened over the last few hours: In a call with top defense and intelligence officials, Biden called for fewer leaks about US intelligence sharing with Ukraine, NBC News reports: US officials previously confirmed claims that American intelligence helped Ukrainian forces, aiding both in the killing Russian generals and the location of the Russian warship Moskva, which was sunk last month.  The Guardian's Dan Sabbagh wrote today that confirmation of the information sharing around the Moskva is a 'a fresh demonstration of the close intelligence support Kyiv is receiving from Washington': It appears now that the President is uncomfortable with the reports. Administration officials have expressed fears that the close association and intelligence sharing could provoke Putin into an escalation. Despite the reports, the Administration denied claims that the US was involved in the attack on the Russian ship and that information was aided in targeting the Russian generals.  While efforts to evacuate civilians from the Azovstal plant in Mariupol continue, Zelenskiy said he also has hopes to get the remaining members of the military out safely. In his nightly address, the Ukrainian president said the mediation of the UN and the International Committee of the Red cross has helped with civilians but that 'influential states' are supporting the safe withdrawal of Ukrainian soldiers.  'During the day, our team organized rescue operations for more than 40 civilians, all women and children,' Zelenskiy said. 'We hope that soon they will be able to arrive in a safe area after two months of shelling, remaining underground in shelters.'", "5f92bc5f8d4f7c4505171e76cdab715a3323c3d191c049093dd53dc3": "A third United Nations operation was under way on Friday morning to evacuate Ukrainian civilians from the Russian-besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, which the UN secretary general has described as a series of 'hellscapes'. An estimated 200 civilians, along with Ukrainian resistance fighters, remained trapped in underground refuges at the huge industrial complex. The UN humanitarian chief, Martin Griffiths, said a convoy was headed to Azovstal 'to receive those civilians remaining in that bleak hell ... and take them back to safety'. The Ukrainian deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said people would be evacuated from Mariupol at midday local time on Friday. The UN and the Red Cross said they had so far helped nearly 500 civilians flee the steel plant area in the southern port city during two operations in the past week. It came as Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russia's invasion had devastated hundreds of hospitals and other medical institutions and left doctors without drugs to tackle cancer or the ability to perform surgery. Zelenskiy said that in eastern and southern Ukraine, the main battlefields, many places lacked even basic antibiotics. 'If you consider just medical infrastructure, as of today Russian troops have destroyed or damaged nearly 400 healthcare institutions: hospitals, maternity wards, outpatient clinics,' Zelenskiy said in a video address to a medical charity group. In areas occupied by Russian forces the situation was catastrophic, he said. 'This amounts to a complete lack of medication for cancer patients. It means extreme difficulties or a complete lack of insulin for diabetes. It is impossible to carry out surgery. It even means, quite simply, a lack of antibiotics.' Russia has unleashed heavy artillery barrages against multiple Ukrainian positions in the south and east of the country. As Victory Day, 9 May, approaches in Russia, it is thought that Vladimir Putin wants to present the occupation of Mariupol for propaganda at home. Ukrainian soldiers said fighting continued to rage, with Russian forces making a final push to enter the steelworks and subdue the city's final defenders. Kremlin officials and propagandists have flocked to Mariupol before Victory Day with cleaning crews clearing rubble and patriotic statues to Russia being erected. Ukrainian intelligence said Russia was planning to hold part of its key parade in the city. 'Mariupol, according to [Russia's] plans, should become the centre of 'celebrations',' Ukraine's defence intelligence agency said. 'For this purpose, the city is urgently cleaning the central streets from rubble, bodies of dead and unexploded Russian ammunition.' The Russian president proclaimed victory in broader Mariupol on 21 April and ordered the steel plant sealed off. The Kremlin said Putin had demanded that Ukrainian fighters in Azovstal to surrender in return for safe passage of civilians. A Ukrainian fighter who said he was holed up in Azovstal accused Russian forces of breaching the plant's defences for a third day despite the pledge by Moscow to pause military activity to permit civilian evacuations. 'Heavy, bloody fighting is going on,' said Captain Sviatoslav Palamar of Ukraine's Azov regiment. 'Yet again, the Russians have not kept the promise of a ceasefire.' Reuters could not independently verify his account or location. The official Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, reiterated a claim that Putin had ordered his military not to storm the plant. Ukraine's stubborn defence of Azovstal has underlined Russia's failure to take major cities in a 10-week-old war that has united western powers in arming Kyiv and punishing Moscow with sanctions. In other key developments:", "ce488e6f09134f419977b43b68fd6caa7e683d98e50fa2605d040cba": "", "6d611d0670b7aef802c5377d9482829b2a61e7634996bf06cb795d8f": "As Victory Day, 9 May, approaches in Russia, Vladimir Putin has yet to win any prize in two months of war in Ukraine that can be shown off to the Russian people. But one could be close: the industrial port city of Mariupol, on the shores of the Azov Sea. Severely damaged in the Russian onslaught, it may now serve as a key prop in the festivities of the coming weeks. Kremlin officials and propagandists have flocked to the town before the holiday, as local cleaning crews are clearing rubble and patriotic statues to Russia are being erected. Fighting is reportedly still raging in the Azovstal plant in Mariupol's industrial zone, which Putin had previously ordered his military chief to block up so that 'not even a fly can get through.' Despite his orders for a siege, Ukrainian soldiers say Russia is making a final push to enter the steelworks and subdue the city's final defenders just days before Victory Day. Ukrainian intelligence has claimed that Russia is planning to hold part of its key Victory Day parade in the city. 'Mariupol, according to [Russia's] plans, should become the centre of 'celebrations',' Ukraine's defence intelligence agency said in a statement. 'For this purpose, the city is urgently cleaning the central streets from rubble, bodies of dead and unexploded Russian ammunition. 'A large-scale propaganda campaign continues, during which Russians will be shown stories about the 'joy' of local residents from meeting with the invaders,' the intelligence agency continued, noting a recent visit by the Russian state television host Vladimir Solovyov to the city alongside officials. He was pictured wearing local army camouflage and later displayed part of a British anti-tank missile launcher that he had brought back to Moscow with him. Mariupol is a city that few Russians would have imagined as a prize before the war, home to a leading iron and steelworks that played an important role in the city's economy but also fuelled local pollution. Nonetheless, it was a vibrant port with an active civil society that had withstood the Russian-backed advance in 2014, when Russian artillery came close enough to Mariupol to bombard the city's outer districts, before being driven back. The Kremlin could be keen to take the city as a strategic point in its goals to build a 'land bridge' to Crimea, to gain access to another deep-water port that it used to transport coal, steel and grain, and as a symbolic victory, the largest city yet taken by Russia, which has failed to conquer Kharkiv or Kyiv. And in an extraordinary visit this week, the presidential aide Sergey Kiriyenko, widely seen as Putin's curator for Russian domestic politics, went to the city this week as part of what are seen as preparations for Russia to absorb the area as part of what has clearly been a war of conquest. The visit chimed with reports that parts of east and southern Ukraine have entered the portfolio of the Kremlin's domestic politics tsar, and served as confirmation, in the words of a local Russian-affiliated official, for 'those who want to see proof that Russia has returned here'. But that victory, if it arrives, will have come at a terrible cost. More than 90% of the city has been damaged, its mayor has said, and even Russian television has shown the extent of the devastation, though blaming it on Ukraine rather than its own artillery's bombardment. An Associated Press investigation on Thursday reported that more than 600 people may have been killed in a strike against the Mariupol drama theatre in March, where women and children had been sheltering from artillery bombardments. In one video, Chechen fighters were seen celebrating the success of their operation to 'destroy and cleanse Mariupol' while standing in front of a burning building in the city centre. Kiriyenko, in his remarks, denied that a parade would take place in cities like Donetsk and Luhansk. 'So far it's impossible to hold the Immortal Regiment or the Victory Parade in Donetsk or Luhansk, but that time will come, and will come soon,' he said. 'And Victory Day parades will pass along all the streets of the cities of Donbas, and the Immortal Regiment will pass through all the streets of the cities of Donbas.' But he did not directly address the question of whether a parade could take place in Mariupol instead.", "418c3e4a98d85dc4217036f3188ae2aba446379a73c524d7b3e81b70": "When women at the border started talking to me about rapes and murders happening inside Ukraine, I thought these were just rumours; I wouldn't let myself believe it. I told myself that it was just people sharing scare stories or that women were just trying to rationalise their feelings of guilt about leaving their husbands and sons. Maybe my psyche was trying to defend itself. Then a woman in her 70s, who said she was from one of the occupied areas close to Irpin and Bucha, crossed the border with her daughter and great-granddaughter. They were being treated by medical volunteers at the French mission. The daughter, who was in her 50s, had cancer and was very sick. The medics could not believe that someone like this, with a hole in her stomach and no bandages, was so desperate to leave that she would risk travelling for so many hours with no medical support. The woman told me that her grandson served in a military brigade that had been the first to go into recently liberated areas. She said he took photos of what he had seen. She showed them to me, and it was only then I understood it was worse than I could have ever imagined. She said that after her grandson had returned from duty, he had come to her house and begged her to leave Ukraine. He told her that women were being raped and killed by Russian troops but she refused to leave. In desperation, he showed her the photos and she knew she had to flee. One of the photos she showed me was the hanging body of a young girl. She couldn't have been more than 14. She said her grandson told her he was walking through the woods looking for dead bodies left by the Russians and lifted his head and saw these girls strung from the trees, all of them very young. They were naked and torn up. She said he had passed on the photos to investigators in Ukraine who were gathering evidence of war crimes. I was not ready to see something like this. In Ukraine now there are many photos of what happened in Bucha but in Poland these are not widely circulated. Since she showed it to me I think my brain has tried to blank it out because I can't even recreate it in my mind. All I remember is a white blur in the top-left corner of a shattered phone screen. She told me that after she had seen these photos she went to the hospital where her daughter was being treated in the oncology ward. She went in, took out her daughter's intravenous drip and helped her walk to the car and they just took off. When I met them on the border, the car they were driving was shattered. The lights were broken, they had foil instead of windows. They had driven all that way in a car where the wheels were still turning but that was about it. But this lady said that after she started driving she didn't stop until she had left Ukraine. Often when women first cross the border they're elated, happy to reach safety. They start smiling, joking - you'd never guess they've had any sort of trauma. Since I have seen that photo, I keep thinking back to those other women I have met and wondering what they might have gone through. There have been women who have been asking me about getting hold of pills that cause menstruation. At the time I didn't understand what they meant.  There was another woman who came over with a 17-year-old daughter. The daughter would not stop crying. I asked her how I could help, and what was going on. She asked for thick menstrual pads, underwear and trousers for the girl. I remember her as she had the same name as my own daughter. That woman also told me that when she went through the last checkpoints outside Kharkiv, she kept driving without stopping. It isn't just the ones who talk about the violence they have faced or witnessed. You worry about all the women who make the crossing. There are many who just cannot deal with being this helpless. There was one woman, you could tell that she was wealthy. Her clothes were very nice, her shoes were very nice. The children were dressed nicely. And from their manners you could tell they were well-off. And their older girl, about 10, sat at the table in the reception centre and said: 'Well, here you have free soup.' And the little boy said: 'I don't want a free soup.' The mother sat not saying anything until she just exploded and yelled: 'You're refugees now, and you need to eat everything they give you.' This was the change they experienced - that when they crossed the border, everything they had had before had stayed behind in Ukraine. Then they leave you and you never find out what happened to them next.", "603ae3ceef5151d8da930f82c6d06c90aac52d7a383e99a1060b879b": "US officials have said they shared information about the location of the Russian warship Moskva with Ukraine prior to its sinking last month, a fresh demonstration of the close intelligence support Kyiv is receiving from Washington. It is unclear how far the US intelligence helped Ukraine launch an accurate double missile strike on the Moskva, and the US officials briefing the information insisted the targeting decision was a matter for the Ukrainians alone. But the fact that the US was willing to confirm it had at least some involvement, three weeks after the Moskva went down on 14 April, shows how far Washington is willing to acknowledge its critical backseat role in the 10-week-long war, even at the risk of openly antagonising Moscow. On Thursday US officials confirmed, first to NBC News, that they provided location information about the Moskva before it was struck. However, Ukraine has its own surveillance capacity, so it is not certain whether the US information was critical. Tracking the location of Russian warships in the Black Sea, which have been threatening Odesa and have launched missile strikes against other Ukrainian cities, has been going on for some time, the officials added. Last month Ukraine fired two Neptune cruise missiles at the Moskva, a missile cruiser with a crew of about 500. It sank after a fire. The number of casualties is not known, although the sinking is one of the biggest naval losses in war seen by any nation for decades. Military intelligence has been critical to Ukraine in its day-to-day fight against Russia, and as the war has gone on the US has been less and less shy about owning up to its own involvement, except when it is suggested that the information might be used to kill senior Russian commanders. In mid-January the CIA director, Bill Burns, told Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that the Kremlin planned to seize Hostomel airport near Kyiv and airlift in troops to seize the capital in any invasion. That allowed Ukrainian forces to draw up a plan to defend the strategic location, which the Russians never fully captured. Last month US officials said they had provided near real-time intelligence about the location and timing of missile strikes as the invasion began on 24 February, allowing Kyiv to relocate vital air defence systems and aircraft, so preventing Russia's air force from gaining superiority over the skies. The US also been providing the location and other details of the Russian military's mobile headquarters, which has allowed Ukraine to target them with artillery strikes, potentially disrupting the invaders' command and control. It is thought to be one reason why about a dozen Russian generals have been killed in the fighting so far, prompting a New York Times report this week with the headline 'US Intelligence Is Helping Ukraine Kill Russian Generals, Officials Say'. US and other officials insist that is a misreading of the situation. On Friday one senior western official repeated a denial given by Adrienne Wilson, a spokesperson for the US national security council, in response to the New York Times report. 'The headline of this story is misleading. And the way it's framed is irresponsible. The United States provides a battlefield intelligence to help Ukrainians defend their country. We do not provide intelligence with the intent to kill Russian generals,' she said. The US has also denied sharing any information that could have allowed Ukraine to target Russia's most senior general, Valery Gerasimov, when he visited the frontline in Izium last weekend. Washington does not provide intelligence information relating to senior Russians, insiders said. But there is no doubting the overall level of cooperation and support from the US at least. Lt Gen Scott Berrier, the chief of defence intelligence, told Congress in an open hearing in March that information-sharing between the two countries was as 'revolutionary in terms of what we can do'. By contrast the UK, normally equally keen to advertise its support for Ukraine in the war, has not acknowledged helping Kyiv with battlefield intelligence. One western official declined to comment when asked if other Five Eyes countries - the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - were similarly engaged. ", "264aa22eae411656804cbd1297a3672a41fbb5ed86e383c9073e076a": "Nato is back. With the invasion of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin has single-handedly revived the fortunes of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, returning it to the top of the foreign policy agenda. Nordic states that once prided themselves on independence from the organisation are now eager to join. The German government has pledged an unprecedented increase in defence spending, which means increasing its contribution to Nato. US military strategists dream anew of opening a Nato franchise for the Pacific, while EU bureaucrats plan a new Nato for the internet. Former liberal holdouts and sceptics of the alliance have learned to love Nato in much the same way they learned to love the CIA and the FBI during the Trump years. The old sheriff of the cold war has regained its focus, and, to the surprise of many, has proved itself to be a remarkably spry and capable force in the fight against Russia. Nato's return to the spotlight has been accompanied by a renewed debate about its history. Every interested party has a different story to tell. For Moscow, Nato has long been a project to subjugate Russia and reduce its influence to a memory. For Washington, Nato began as a way of protecting western Europeans from themselves and from the Soviet Union, but in the 90s it became a forward operating vehicle for democracy, human rights and capital. For eastern Europeans, Nato is the sacred pledge to keep Russian tanks at bay. For most western European states, Nato has provided a bargain-price American nuclear umbrella that allowed them to fund social welfare rather than armies, when they were not using their Nato obligations to justify austerity. For the rest of the world, Nato was once an Atlantic-based, defensive alliance that quickly transformed into an ever-farther-afield, offensive one. A striking feature of these well-worn arguments over Nato is that they all assume a high degree of familiarity with the thing itself. For all that it is central to a certain conception of Europe - or even the west - few can say what, exactly, it is. Crammed into a four-letter acronym is something more than a simple military alliance. Nato is no longer particularly 'Northern', nor 'Atlantic', nor bound to a 'Treaty', while calling it an 'organisation' almost makes it sound like a charitable enterprise. Part of the reason Nato's shape can be difficult to discern is that the alliance has, at least in the west, won a long war of public relations. In the 50s, Nato sent travelling 'caravans' - mass exhibitions and outdoor movie theatres - into the hinterlands of Europe to explain the benefits of the alliance to sceptical populations. Such a strenuous case for Nato no longer needs to be made, and opposition to it has vastly diminished since the 1980s. What was once presumed to be an artefact of the cold war order sits so comfortably at the heart of the west's military-political-economic system that it is frequently mistaken for a natural feature in the European landscape. On paper, Nato is an alliance of 30 nation-states committed to free institutions and bound together by article 5 of its charter, which holds that - albeit conditionally - members will collectively defend any member that is attacked. Born in 1949, Nato sees itself as the younger sibling of other international institutions of mid-century vintage - the UN and the GATT, which became the World Trade Organisation - and takes pride in having kept the European peace for more than half a century. Militarily, if not economically, Nato has largely fulfilled the mission its first secretary general, Hastings Ismay, set out for it: 'To keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down.' Though primarily a military alliance, Nato is also a culture, or as Nato's third supreme allied commander, Alfred Gruenther, declared: 'Nato is a state of mind.' Nato company towns dot the continent (Brunssum, Ramstein, Geilenkirchen, Oberammergau, Uedem, Aviano, Swietoszow), there are Nato schools for Nato employees' children and Nato academies and centres where Nato military curriculums are taught ('smart training for smart defence'), the Nato Defense College in Rome, a Nato underground pipeline for jet fuel that runs through Germany, a Nato songbook, a Nato hymn, a Bing Crosby Nato ballad, a Nato phonetic alphabet ('Alpha, Bravo ... '), Nato-funded grants and university chairs, an annual International Model Nato for university students, a Nato Hermes scarf, a Nato golf club in Belgium for handicap 36 and below, and a Nato headquarters in Brussels, which houses the British-funded 'counter-propaganda' unit, as well as the Nato museum, or what is known in Nato-speak as an 'arts heritage hub,' which exhibits copies of Ancient Greek statuary and a large number of unremarkable wooden desks. Nato's budget on paper is a relatively modest EUR2.5bn, with contributions from all member states, but the $800bn US defence budget guarantees that Nato can spend much of its own funds on bureaucratic upkeep. Despite some nods to how it produces all decisions by 'consensus', Nato makes little attempt to hide the fact of American primacy in the alliance. In the official legal procedure for leaving Nato, the charter declares that a state must declare its intention not to Nato's secretary general, but to the president of the United States. In practice, Nato is above all a political arrangement that guarantees US primacy in determining answers to European questions. The political headquarters of Nato are located in a new modernist building in Brussels, but its most significant military command centre is located in Norfolk, Virginia. Every supreme allied commander since 1949 has been an American military officer. Nato itself has no forces of its own. It comprises about 4,000 bureaucratic personnel who coordinate its activities around the world. Nato military forces at any given time are made up of forces voluntarily seconded by member governments, with the US as the main contributor. Nato's wars and engagements - which have dragooned Luxembourgers and Turks into fighting in Korea, and Spaniards and Portuguese into fighting in Afghanistan - have typically been authored by Washington. Even wars that have been primarily fought by Europeans - such as the Nato intervention in Libya - have relied overwhelmingly on American logistics, fuelling stations and hardware. The crown jewels of Nato are its nuclear weapons. In theory, the three Nato nuclear powers - Britain, France and the US - coordinate the nuclear defence for the rest of the alliance. Nato maintains nuclear forces on the continent, but they are largely ceremonial. If Moscow lobbed a nuclear missile at Brussels, the initial response would come unilaterally from Washington since following actual Nato procedures involves laborious protocols. (The nuclear group in Nato would first have to confer and agree to respond, and then request Washington's portion of the nuclear code in order to launch the missiles stationed on their territory.) Nuclear-capable aircraft in Belgium are flown and maintained by Belgians, as is the case in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. But none of these weapons systems are on the same high alert that the American president is capable of activating without any other Nato member's permission. Only France and Britain, which have their own fully independent nuclear forces, have the possibility of eliminating their enemies in a nuclear strike without consulting the White House. Ever since its birth in 1949, the funeral toll for Nato has been sounded many times, especially by those who forget that crises are its lifeblood. The Alliance itself was very nearly still-born. At the end of the second world war, Franklin Roosevelt expected both western and Soviet troops to leave central Europe within two years. But western European statesmen wanted the US to provide a security guarantee while they rebuilt their economies. There were many proposals for how this security pact could be configured. The American strategist George Kennan proposed a 'dumbbell' system, in which the western Europe would have its own defence system, while Canada and the US had a separate one that could come to western Europe's aid in the unlikely event of a Soviet invasion. The prominent liberal journalist Walter Lippmann argued that there was no point in the US stationing troops in Europe in a world in which nuclear weapons had rendered conventional forces redundant. But leading anti-communists such as Ernest Bevin and Dean Acheson rejected this vision. They knew that the Red Army, which had just vanquished the Nazis, was not only the strongest force on the continent, but also an alarmingly popular one in western Europe. Instead, Bevin and his European counterparts formed what they called the Western Union, which extended the postwar Dunkirk treaty between France and the United Kingdom to include Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Belgium. When this organisation asked Washington to provide a binding security guarantee, American diplomats took control of the project, and steered it into what would become Nato, a much more expansive security pact that included 12 member states, with the US in the lead. At the time, the debate about 'enlargement' was about whether or not to include states like Italy in the alliance. Kennan thought the idea of Nato extension into southern Europe 'weakly provocative' toward the Soviet Union, and that it set the stage for limitless expansion. He believed Nato only made sense as a pact among what he saw as racially and culturally similar North Atlantic peoples, and bemoaned an alliance that would have the effect of freezing cold war battle lines across the middle of Europe. From the start, Nato was unpopular with member publics. Harry Truman could not afford to risk mentioning his plans for the North Atlantic alliance to a war-weary American public in his first campaign for the presidency. French communists and nationalists - opposed on nearly every other issue - jointly protested France's entry into Nato in 1949. There were enormous anti-Nato insurrections across Italy. The largest uprising in Iceland's postwar history occurred when the island nation joined the alliance. An extensive repertory of Icelandic anti-Nato anthems and songs sprang up during the negotiations between Reykjavik and Washington. On the eve of Iceland's Nato membership, the communist novelist and future Nobel laureate Halldor Laxness published The Atom Station, an Icelandic Remains of the Day, in which a young serving woman from the north witnesses the Reykjavik elite sell out the country to Nato officials behind closed doors. The first postwar decade was tumultuous for Nato. With Europe's economic recovery in full swing, the conviction that the continent needed an American security guarantee was weakened. Truman's Korean war showed how easily the US could become overextended. In response, western European leaders drew up plans for the European Defence Community, which would combine the fledgling armies of West Germany, France, Italy and the Benelux countries. But this plan for a European army fell apart almost as soon as it was floated. Britain saw the combined force as a threat to national sovereignty. The French government, meanwhile, was more worried about a resurgent Germany than a Soviet invasion. Paradoxically, then, this early drive for autonomy from Washington on the part of western European states ended up bringing them more tightly into the fold of Nato, which proved to be the only arrangement capable of plastering over their divisions. Nato may have begun as a security stopgap, but it soon became a guarantor of western stability in ways beyond the imagination of its architects. For the US, massive defence budgets became a way of life, and the least controversial way to facilitate public spending in a postwar economy that still aimed at full employment. That the country was never fully reconciled to this permanent war posture is neatly captured in the ritual of nearly every postwar American president promising, and failing, to reduce US troop levels in Europe. Meanwhile, for western Europeans, American defence largesse allowed them to devote more of their surplus to their welfare states, in an effort to appease their more militant labour movements. The political stability that Nato achieved in the 50s was never free from ruptures. In 1955, Washington ushered West Germany into the Alliance, to which the Soviets reacted with the creation of their own, anti-Nato security system, the Warsaw Pact. A year later, Nato wobbled badly when the Suez crisis exposed the divisions between members that wanted to cling to their colonial possessions and a Washington that was keen to win favour with Third World nationalists who might otherwise turn communist. (Belgium, France and the Netherlands had even initially wanted their colonies included in Nato, which was far too much for Washington.) Nato command had an ambivalent attitude toward the British empire. On the one hand, Nato helped accelerate imperial decline by, for instance, demanding Britain fulfil its obligations to station thousands of British troops on the Rhine, at the cost of more critical colonial nodes such as Singapore. But American strategists were also worried the British retreat from the resource-rich Middle East would leave behind a vacuum, which Nato tried to fill by spawning the Middle East Treaty Organisation (Meto), one of several failed attempts to replicate itself. The 60s are remembered at Nato as a time of ongoing emergency. For years, Charles de Gaulle's patience with the alliance had been on a short fuse. 'Nato is a fake,' he declared in 1963. 'Thanks to Nato, Europe is placed under the dependence of the United States without appearing to be so.' Three years later De Gaulle withdrew France - and its nuclear weapons - from Nato's command. (This withdrawal was more theatrical than actual: France's participation in Nato exercises and technology-sharing remained nearly unchanged and it was still a Nato member.) De Gaulle's decision was partly the result of his delusion about the status of France as a great power. But he also - more imaginatively - saw Russia as a natural part of Europe, one cordoned off by a cold war that he believed would one day be over. In De Gaulle's view, Washington's capitalism and Moscow's communism were converging toward a remarkably similar technocratic society. He saw Nato as a deliberate American attempt to slow down history, in order to prolong the moment when Washington was the leading world power. But despite the uproar De Gaulle caused among cold war stalwarts, and the bevy of Nato obituaries that followed, the alliance was perhaps even strengthened by France's semi-departure. It allowed Nato to more fully integrate West Germany into the alliance, and to sound the alarm for increased commitments from other member states. In these decades, opposition to Nato was a rallying cry for the western European left, which viewed it not only as an institutionalised form of nuclear brinkmanship, but as a class alliance between American and European ruling establishments determined to shore up their defence as much against their domestic opposition - whether by spying on French communists, or rooting out the members of the German Red Army Faction who bombed Nato pipelines - as against the Soviets. Nato was not particularly concerned about the domestic political arrangements of its member states, so long as they were implacably anti-communist. Portugal under Salazar's dictatorship was welcomed into Nato in 1949, and in 1967, when fascist Greek colonels used Nato's own counter-insurgency blueprints to overthrow a democratically elected government, the legal claim, led by the Scandinavian states, that it should exit the Alliance was never seriously entertained. There have been more serious threats to Nato unity, however. Greece and Turkey violently clashed over Cyprus in 1974. More recently, in the wake of Nato's 2011 intervention in Libya, militias backed by Turkey and Italy fought the French-backed Libyan army of General Haftar. Nato unity took another blow in 2018, when, after Turkey began besieging US and western European Kurdish allies in Syria, Emmanuel Macron declared the alliance 'brain dead'. Nato also took a psychological hit during the presidency of Donald Trump, who liked to publicly question the alliance's purpose and refused to mumble pieties about article 5 during a visit to Nato headquarters, albeit all while increasing US expenditure and troop levels in Europe. But Nato's most serious existential crisis came in the 1990s, when the raison d'etre of the organisation - the Soviet Union - collapsed. In this new environment, it was not clear even to Nato's own functionaries what its future would be. All that remained was the prospect of janitorial twilight, with Nato helping to mop up and dismantle the Soviet Union's nuclear arsenal. Not only had the organising spectre of the organisation vanished, but a series of new institutions in Europe - the European Union above all - seemed to proffer a European future of greater coherence and autonomy from the US. Even before the Soviet Union fell, there were proposals for new political arrangements, including Francois Mitterrand's short-lived idea of a European Confederation that would pointedly include the USSR and exclude the US. In 1989, Michael Gorbachev appropriated De Gaulle's old dream of a Europe that stretched from the Atlantic to the Urals, which he called a 'common European home,' in which 'a doctrine of restraint should take the place of the doctrine of deterrence.' Several prominent participants and observers in the 1990s believed that Nato, its mission accomplished, would close shop. 'Let's disband both Nato and the Warsaw Pact. Let's release your allies and ours,' Eduard Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign minister gamely proposed to the US secretary of state in 1989. Later that same year, the Czech leader Vaclav Havel told George HW Bush that he expected American and Russian troops would soon be vacating central Europe. Prominent American strategists agreed. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, it was time for Europeans to take their security back in their own hands, with the US withdrawing its troops from the continent. 'The Soviet threat provides the glue that holds Nato together,' John Mearsheimer, one of the US's leading international relations theorists, wrote in the Atlantic Monthly in 1990. 'Take away that offensive threat and the United States is likely to abandon the continent.' To glance at the output of Nato bureaucracy from the 1990s is to witness a sea of panicked position papers outlining ways to prolong the life of an ailing patient. But Nato's 1990s crisis turned out to be its greatest hour. Not only did it not shut down during the decade, it expanded. It did not fade into the background as a vestigial cold war organ, but became more active. 'Nato must go out of area or it will go out of business,' became the mantra of Nato apparatchiks across the decade. In just a few short years, Nato went from being a primarily defensive organisation to a brazenly offensive one - from being a geopolitically conservative custodian of the status-quo to an agent of change in eastern Europe. How did this happen? As the George HW Bush administration surveyed the ruins of the Soviet Union, they determined that the new challenge for Nato was not the nascent Russian Federation, but a unified Europe. 'We must seek to prevent the emergence of European-only security arrangements which would undermine Nato,' read the draft of a leaked 1992 national security council memo. In its rhetoric, Bush's administration was cautious about Nato expansion. But in practice, it was cold war triumphalist: over the vociferous protests of Gorbachev, Bush incorporated a newly unified Germany into Nato. Soon after, Nato's training of Ukrainian troops began. When Bill Clinton became president in 1992, the real difference was that the rhetoric of expansion matched the practice. Clinton presided over the 1999 entry of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into Nato, and treated Russia as the wrecked state it was.  There was some irony in Clinton's doubling down on Nato. In many ways he had appeared to be the ideal figure to shutter the alliance. On the campaign trail in 1992, Clinton had made rumbles about downsizing Nato in favour of newer, sleeker 'rapid-deployment' UN military units. Initially, Clinton was sceptical of Nato's extension eastward. 'So let me get this straight,' he reportedly said to his national security staff on being briefed of the expansion plan. All the Russians would get 'out of this really great deal we're offering them' is an assurance 'that we're not going to our military stuff into their former military allies, who are now going to be our allies, unless we happen to wake up one morning and decide to change our minds?' But Nato expansion was ultimately signed off on by Clinton - and avidly pursued by his administration for three primary reasons. The first was that it was pressed on the Pentagon by former states of the Warsaw Pact. For a country like Poland, Nato membership was the first step toward reorienting Warsaw back towards the wealthy west. 'Let the Russian generals get upset,' the Polish leader Lech Walesa chimed to his US counterpart in 1993. 'They won't launch a nuclear war.' The second had to do with Clinton's own domestic calculus, and how support for Nato membership would win votes from large eastern European emigre enclaves in the US rustbelt, not a minor consideration for an administration primarily concentrated on home affairs. The final reason had to do with the crystallisation of the ideology of human rights in the 90s, when the US preponderance of power globally was so great as to make concerns about impinging on a foreign nation's sovereignty beneath consideration. Many former Nato critics had come to embrace the organisation by the end of the cold war, seeing it as the only viable vehicle for their new programme of humanitarian intervention. By 1995, the secretary general of Nato was Javier Solana, who had authored the 1982 tract 50 Reasons to Say No to Nato, which had helped carry his socialist party to victory in Spain, and who was himself formerly on the US list of subversive agents. The 1995 bombing of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and later Kosovo in 1999, were showcases of Nato's newfound place in the post-cold war order. Not only did Clinton's decision to bomb the former Yugoslavia circumvent the UN security council, and prove that the EU, and especially Germany, were incapable of solving security crises in their own neighbourhood. But it was also a show of force that arguably shook the Kremlin more than Nato expansion itself. The war was a preview of coming attractions: the reliance on technological, 'no-fault' military operations that did not require US ground troops, and the expectation that Nato-led interventions could create instant US-aligned constituencies like the Kosovan Albanians, who continue to name their children after Clinton and Bush. The Clinton administration's faith in Nato expansion and Nato warfare reflected its faith in capital and markets. Nato, in this view, came to act as something like a rating agency that would declare portions of eastern Europe as safe zones for foreign investment and ultimately EU membership. 'We will seek to update Nato so that there continues behind the enlargement of market democracies an essential collective security,' Clinton's national security adviser, Anthony Lake, declared in 1993. This cocktail of markets and democracy talk, along with geostrategic interests, proved very difficult for American politicians to resist: it appeared to be a perfect marriage of realism and idealism. By the end of the decade, only a zealous rump of cold warriors - from the American statesman Paul Nitze to the conservative historian Richard Pipes - still held out against Nato expansion. Earlier sceptics of Nato expansion, such as Joe Biden, toured eastern Europe and returned to Washington converts of the expansionist cause. Likewise, Republican opponents of Clinton's domestic policy, such as Newt Gingrich - who himself had once borrowed $13,000 from his friends to take a sabbatical in Europe to write a novel about Nato (still uncompleted) - were in full accord about expansion, which was duly enshrined in the Republican manifesto, the 'Contract for America'. Radicalising Clinton's own position, they only wanted him to move faster. Ukraine became a special point of interest during the Clinton years, and was USAid's third-largest recipient of funds during the 1990s, exceeded only by Egypt and Israel. Before Putin's invasion it had received more than $3bn; since Russia went in the US has already given $14bn, and $33bn more has been promised. Nato training of Ukrainian troops sharply increased over time. Starting with Clinton's military intervention in the Kosovo war in 1999, Ukraine's troops could be counted in almost every US-led post-cold war operation, including in Afghanistan and Iraq. The Ukrainian army's robust resistance to the Russian onslaught is perhaps less surprising than it should be: large segments of it are Nato-trained and capable of making effective use of Nato-grade weaponry. By the time George W Bush came to power in 2001, Nato was still basking in the glow of its war in the Balkans, where it still today polices a statelet of its own making in Kosovo. In the wake of the attacks of 9/11, when the Bush administration invoked article 5 for the first time, Nato added the global coordination of counter-terrorism to its portfolio, all but turning a blind eye to Russia's domestic anti-terror campaign, as well as Beijing's first major actions against the Uyghurs in Xinjiang province. But while Bush shared Clinton's faith in the inevitable triumph of the American way, he wanted to shed some of the pretence of the Nato alliance. If Washington was the only power in Nato that mattered, and humanity had already entered into a unipolar world order, what was the point of waiting for American desires to be seconded by Belgians? Bush's Iraq war was thus fought over the criticism of some Nato members, such as France and Germany, whose actual military forces Bush viewed as irrelevant. You were either with the US or against it in the Bush years, and quite evidently, the eastern Europeans were with the US, and Bush wanted them amply rewarded. Over the warnings of Germany and France, Bush thus saw no reason to heed Russian demands about not promising Georgia and Ukraine Nato membership, which he did in 2008. In this period, as eastern Europe and Washington grew closer, it was not lost on Warsaw, Budapest and Prague - where there were nationalists who were much more comfortable with US-style nationalism than the post-nationalism vaunted by Brussels - that Washington could also serve as a useful ally in their own disputes within the European Union. Washington's most steadfast allies in Nato today are Poland and the Baltics. If forced to choose between either the hegemony of Berlin or Brussels, or that of Washington, for eastern European leaders, Washington wins every time. Whereas Britain has specialised in hosting Russian capital, Germany in consuming Russian energy, and France has historically seen Russia as a potential strategic partner, Poland and the Baltics never cease to stress the threat to their hard-won sovereignty. Washington has come to share their view of Russia: it is no longer worth 'resetting' relations with an unredeemable country. For many hawks in Washington, Russia needs to stay irredeemable if Nato is to continue pointing to the vast gulf that separates states under its wing from the barbarians at the gate. From this perspective, a strong, liberal, democratic Russia would perhaps have posed an even greater challenge to US hegemony in Europe than an autocratic, revanchist, but ultimately weak Russia. If eastern European states are convinced that Nato safeguards their sovereignty, it would seem that the reverse applies to Europe more widely. Ever since the election of Donald Trump, when Angela Merkel announced that Europe may one day have to look after its own security, there has been an expectation that EU states would inch away from their US protectors, many of whom, at least in theory, would welcome the prospect of a stronger European partner. But in practice Nato often tugs Europeans away from their own self-declared interests. In 2010, the government of the Netherlands fell when the public rejected its lock-step obedience to Nato's Afghanistan mission. Already under US pressure for forging closer energy ties with Russia, Germany may now need to placate Nato by sending heavy weaponry to Ukraine and cutting itself off from Russian energy altogether. This apparent split between European and US interests has continued to galvanise a handful of European thinkers. In 2018, Germany's grand man of the left, Hans-Magnus Enzenberger, described Nato as a tributary system with member and associate states sending periodic offerings of soldiers for Washington's wars. His French counterpart, Regis Debray, echoing De Gaulle, has called Nato 'nothing more than the military and political subordination of western Europe by the United States'. For years in Europe there has been mesmerisingly vague talk of a new initiative called the European Security and Defence Identity, which is somehow meant to emerge, like Athena, from the head of Nato. But Russia's invasion of Ukraine has revealed how deceptive European steps toward autonomy are, and how deep-set the institutional lock of Nato is over the continent. 'The idea of Europe's strategic autonomy goes too far if it fosters the illusion that we can guarantee security, stability and prosperity in Europe without Nato and without the US,' the German foreign minister flatly declared already in 2020. If anything, Nato's power and relevance is due to increase in the coming years, and the increase in European defence spending, which is still puny in comparison with Washington's, only means that there will be more material under Nato purview. From the expanses of the Sahel to the banks of the Dnieper, there is ever less wriggle room under Washington's supervision. The trouble with the drive for European defence autonomy is not merely that - like the rollout of the European Defence Community in 1952 - it could backfire. But rather that, considering what the European Union is today, if it ever did succeed in taking a more militarised form, this would hardly be a rosy prospect. A competent EU army patrolling the Sahel for migrants, enforcing an elaborate repatriation system, and forcing regimes in Africa and Asia to continue being extraction points for its resources and receptacles of its trash, would only serve to clinch the status of 'Fortress Europe' as a vanguard of xenophobic neoliberalism. The English historian EP Thompson argued in 1978 that 'Natopolitanism' was a form of extreme apathy, a pathology wrapped in an empty ideology that only knew what it was against. But Thompson was writing at a time when calls to abolish the alliance were not yet a weary incantation. In 1983, Nato's placement of Pershing missiles in West Germany could still summon one of the largest protests in postwar German history. But if Nato's institutionalisation of nuclear brinksmanship was once considered a lethal gambit by many citizens of Nato states, today Nato's recent wars in Libya and Afghanistan have proceeded without domestic hindrance, despite their abject failure and having manifestly made the world more dangerous. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has delivered Nato the grandest possible reprieve. Nobody doubts Nato's effective support of Ukraine's defence of its territory, though the war is not yet over. The tougher question is whether Nato is a cold war corset that has constrained the freedom of the west - and imperilled populations around the world - more than it has secured either. At a time when there has never been more need for an alternative world order, Nato seems to close the door on that possibility. Nato may be back. But it may be back only to hoist the old banner: 'There is no alternative.'

The 17-year-old applied to join a family in Hampshire under the Homes for Ukraine scheme on 11 April and thought it would be straightforward. But with no decision from the Home Office, it appears Nazarii may be the latest casualty of a government policy that denies visas to unaccompanied children. Under-18s travelling alone are not permitted to be hosted under the Homes for Ukraine programme, leaving them with no route to Britain. British families that have been carefully vetted and subject to enhanced DBS checks are frustrated that they cannot help teenagers with whom they have been matched. Many are already alone and vulnerable to trafficking and abuse. The government claims the policy is designed to safeguard children, but by offering no alternative, charities say it could leave young people in greater danger in Ukraine and elsewhere in Europe. For Nazarii, travelling with his parents is not an option. His mother has to care for elderly relatives in their village near Ternopil and his father is a much-needed doctor. His potential host, Samantha Read, 54, from Church Crookham in Hampshire, works as a teaching assistant and lives with her husband, Tim, and their 17-year-old son, Theo. She said she rang the Home Office helpline at the start of April to ask if she could host a 17-year-old and was told it was fine if there was written parental permission. After DBS checks and vetting by social services they were expecting the visa any day. Speaking about Nazarii's parents, Read said: 'All they want is to keep their son safe so he can have a positive future. We have formed a bond with this family. We know we can support him emotionally, financially, provide a safe haven in a loving family home. 'Is it really too much to ask that the Home Office grant this visa as they told me they would in a timely manner?' Meanwhile, Nazarii is left wondering how he will find safety. 'I often hear many sirens and military planes, terrible sounds,' he said. Robina Qureshi, chief executive of the refugee hosting charity Positive Action In Housing, said: 'The thing that is most shocking about this is that the most vulnerable of refugees, unaccompanied children, are being denied access to the UK.' Qureshi wants established charities like hers, with experience of placing refugees with families, to be allowed to bring teenagers to Britain. 'We need the government to act urgently for the sake of 18 unaccompanied minors who we are supporting at present who are at risk of trafficking or being forced to live in or return to a war zone. They are frankly terrified,' she said. Kostiantyn and Sasha, both 17, are sleeping on a stranger's sofa in Warsaw having fled Ukraine at the end of February. The friends, who were studying engineering and maths at college together in Kyiv, speak fluent English and no Polish. They were matched by Positive Action In Housing with a carefully vetted couple in Manchester. Kostiantyn said: 'We were convinced everything was going to be alright but now we've discovered that we can't come without our parents and it seems impossible. 'In Ukraine if you're 16 you can travel - you don't need to ask your parent.' Dennis Colligan, 60, a GP from Didsbury in Manchester, agreed to host the boys along with his wife, Cathy, 59, a speech therapist. Both have enhanced criminal records checks as part of their jobs and empty spare rooms as their three adult children have left home. Colligan said: 'It's very disappointing because we've got a situation that would work. Cathy and I have got the space, we've got the resources and we've got a background in knowing about safeguarding, children, health and welfare. 'It seems a real shame that we can't actually get them over here and get them settled, so they feel safe and can resume their education.' Kostiantyn's mother has stayed in Ukraine to support his father and he wants to be able to work and send money home to support his family. Sasha's mother has gone to France. They are nervous of the risks if the placement falls through. Sasha said: 'We want to travel to the United Kingdom because we have a sponsor here - we already know we'll find a place to sleep and a friend in Manchester who's a really nice person. But we don't have all of these benefits in other countries like France or Germany, so it's more dangerous to go there.' Dan Paskins, director of UK impact at Save the Children, said 'The government's 'one size fits all' approach in these instances can put children at risk of taking dangerous routes to seek safety. 'What's needed are caseworkers who are on the ground, who have the skills, background and knowledge to be able to make a really informed and rapid assessment of each individual case - particularly for children coming to live with adults with whom they have a longstanding relationship.' A government spokesperson said: 'Due to safeguarding concerns, unaccompanied minors are only eligible under the Homes for Ukraine scheme if they are reuniting with a parent or legal guardian in the UK. 'There are no plans to make those trying to sponsor unaccompanied children 'guardians'.'", "6334081c09809335da5d82d6bba2dea293ab6bd08bae69e03d2d5bf0": "Boris Johnson has recorded a clip for broadcasters about the results. He started by paying tribute to Conservative councillors, and said the result were 'mixed'. In some parts of the country it had been 'tough', he said.  But in other areas there were 'quite remarkable gains in places that have not voted Conservative for a long time, if ever'. He said that the message he drew from the results was that people want him to get on with 'the big issues that matter to them'. UPDATE: Johnson said: Boris Johnson's leadership is facing fresh peril after senior Conservatives blamed him for losing swaths of the party's southern heartlands to the Liberal Democrats and flagship London boroughs to Labour. In a punishing set of local elections for the Tories, the party lost about 400 council seats, ceding control of Westminster and Wandsworth in London to Labour for the first time since the 1970s, and plunging to its worst position in Scotland for a decade. Conservative MPs and council leaders questioned Johnson's leadership, demanding action to tackle the cost of living crisis and rebuild trust in the wake of the Partygate scandal after a damaging series of losses across the 'blue wall' in Somerset, Kent, Oxfordshire and Surrey. However, the scale of the Tory backlash was tempered by a mixed picture for Labour, which showed progress, but not enough yet to suggest a landslide for Keir Starmer in a general election. A BBC projection for a general election based on Friday's results put Labour on 291 seats, the Conservatives on 253, the Lib Dems on 31 and others on 75. Labour had a very strong result in London and took some southern councils such as Worthing, Crawley and Southampton, gaining about 250 seats in total. It pushed the Tories out of control in their only council in Wales, Monmouthshire, and took over as the party with the second largest vote share in Scotland, where the SNP remained dominant. But in the north of England and the Midlands, Labour struggled to make gains in 'red wall' areas it had lost at or since the 2019 election, despite a convincing win on the new Cumberland council. Conservative HQ was also buoyed by the news that Starmer is now being investigated over allegations of Covid rule-breaking at a Durham campaign event, muddying the waters over Johnson's own fine for a lockdown gathering. Starmer said the results were a 'big turning point' for his party. 'From the depths of 2019, that general election, winning in the north, Cumberland, Southampton. We've changed Labour and now we're seeing the results of that.' The Lib Dems also had a clearly successful election night in England, adding at least 189 seats. They took control of the new unitary authority in Somerset, previously a Tory stronghold, edged out the Conservatives in Portsmouth, and pushed them out of control in West Oxfordshire. The Greens also performed well, winning 81 seats - more than doubling their number of councillors - as voters also turned to independents and residents' associations.

You can follow our global liveblog here: TUV leader Jim Allister has been elected as an MLA (member of the legislative assembly) for North Antrim. After his election, Allister said he regretted that the party had not managed to secure any other seats. Allister said: The front pages of tomorrow's papers are out. Curiously many of them have chosen not to cover the local elections with Keir Starmer's beergate controversy and the Queen's jubilee balcony plans (which don't include Prince Andrew, Prince Harry or Meghan) taking up space instead.  One stands out for suggesting that Boris is back on track despite losing nearly 400 seats. Here's ours which focuses on Boris Johnson being blamed for the Tory's poor results. The Independent went for a similar top line. Meanwhile, the Telegraph focused on the results in Northern Ireland. Here's a closer look at the Express. The Daily Mail chose to focus on Starmer's woes as he faces faces a police investigation over lockdown breach claims. The Mirror, on the other hand, chose to lead with the plans for the Queen's jubilee. Lutfur Rahman, the disgraced politician found by an election tribunal to have engaged in corrupt and illegal practices, has secured a comeback by winning the vote to become mayor of Tower Hamlets in east London. After the five-year ban placed on him for standing for public office lapsed, Rahman managed to unseat the incumbent mayor, Labour's John Biggs, under the banner of his Aspire party. Rahman was kicked out of office in 2015 after a specialist court concluded that he was guilty of vote-rigging, buying votes and religious intimidation. But the police and Crown Prosecution Service decided there was insufficient evidence to launch a criminal prosecution. Rahman won 40,804 votes on the second round, with Biggs on 33,487. The result is a blow to Labour in what was otherwise a very successful set of results in London, where it took Wandsworth, Barnet and Westminster from the Tories. Rahman announced in February that he was planning a political comeback with a challenge to Labour over 'service cuts, tax hikes and road closures'. In an election leaflet, he wrote: 'I have never, ever acted dishonestly, but to those who think I didn't exercise enough oversight over campaigners in the last election, I apologise.' Read the full story from my colleagues Aubrey Allegretti and Rowena Mason: The Conservatives suffered disastrous losses across Wales in the local elections, with the party's Welsh leadership blaming the crisis in No 10 for their woes, while there were encouraging gains for Labour, Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. One of the most striking results on Friday came from Denbighshire in the north-east, where the Tories dropped from first to fourth place. They also lost control of their only council, Monmouthshire, in the south-east. Denbighshire is seen as crucial because the Tories routed Labour in the north-east during the 2019 general election. Boris Johnson visited the seaside town of Rhyl last week to try to shore up support but some party members on the ground believe his presence hindered rather than helped. The Tories had been part of an independent-led administration but Labour became the biggest party in the county and may now try to form a new coalition. In Monmouthshire, Labour becomes the largest group for the first time since 1995. Andrew RT Davies, the leader of the Tories at the Welsh parliament, said the party's candidates had wanted to talk about how they were tackling the cost-of-living crisis locally, but had to answer questions about Johnson. He told the BBC:  Read the full story here: Dylan Tippetts has said he hopes his election will 'dial down hate and division' after becoming Plymouth's first openly trans councillor. The 21-year-old is Labour's first councillor in the city's Compton Ward. Speaking to the PA news agency, Tippetts said he is 'still in shock', adding: 'I didn't think I was going to win the seat last night. He added that trans people should be respected 'as the human beings that we are'. Plymouth Sutton and Devonport Labour MP Luke Pollard said he is 'so proud' of Tippetts. Tippetts grew up in Bridgwater, Somerset, and came out in 2018. He told PA he moved to Plymouth shortly afterwards for a 'fresh start, as coming out wasn't the best experience for me'. He said he is 'proud' to represent a party with a 'positive vision' for the city, adding that residents have been 'ignored and taken for granted for far too long'. He said he hopes to address concerns about the cost-of-living crisis, as well as to give a 'voice' to those who do not have one. He said: The Conservatives have lost control of the only council they had majority control of in Wales. Monmouthshire, in south-east Wales, has been led by the party since 2017 but Labour now has the most seats, PA News reports. Although no party has taken overall control of the local authority, Labour gained 14 seats to have a total of 22. Labour had two fewer than were needed for a majority, and lost out on gaining full control of the council in a coin toss. The Tories lost six seats to have an overall total of 18, once counting had finished. Several Senedd members and Conservative MP David Davies had visited the area in the days leading up to the election on 5 May, but it was not enough to instil confidence in the electorate. The leader of the area's Conservative group, Richard John, who has been vocal in his criticism of prime minister Boris Johnson over the partygate scandal, retained his seat. However John told ITV Wales people had 'sent a message that the party needs to consider'. Labour notched up 16 gains in Cardiff to increase its overall majority on the city council to 31, PA News reports. Labour now has 55 seats, the Conservatives 11, the Liberal Democrats 10, Plaid Cymru two and Propel one. The winner of a council seat determined by the drawing of straws joked that his Labour rival lost after he chose the straw on the left. Independent Andy Solloway was declared the winner in the Skipton West and West Craven division of the new North Yorkshire unitary authority on Friday after tying with Labour's Peter Madeley on 503 votes, even after a recount at Skipton Town Hall. Solloway told BBC Radio 5Live how he ended up drawing straws with Madeley's representative, Brian McDaid, after first discussing with the returning officers the possibility of picking playing cards or tossing a coin. He said the returning officer had even offered to go out and buy a pack of cards before it was decided that straw-pulling was the fairest method. The councillor said: Asked how he felt seeing that he had drawn the long straw, Solloway replied: The poll in Skipton West and West Craven was part of the biggest overhaul of local government in North Yorkshire for nearly 50 years. The new councillors will serve the final year of the existing council but will then become the first councillors to serve on the new unitary authority which will launch on April 1 2023. After the votes were counted, the Tories secured a four-seat majority to govern the final 11 months of North Yorkshire County Council before it merges with seven district councils to create the new single overarching authority across the 3,100 square miles of England's largest county. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has hailed a 'resounding victory' as her party celebrates its best ever Scottish council election result. The first minister said: She said the party would now turn its efforts to the task of reaching agreement on forming administrations with other parties who 'share our progressive principles'.  She said: Scottish Labour has become the closest challenger to Nicola Sturgeon's SNP after the Scottish Conservatives plunged to their worst electoral result in a decade. Labour enjoyed an unexpected win in West Dunbartonshire, taking overall control of the council, and won a swathe of seats elsewhere as it took the second largest share of the vote overall. In another surprise, it fell one seat short of beating the SNP in Glasgow, Sturgeon's home city, raising the prospect that the SNP may form a formal coalition there with the Greens. Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, said: The results triggered sharp recriminations among Scottish Tories, who found themselves relegated to third as voters punished them over Partygate by abstaining or switching their support. Embarrassed by defeats in wealthy areas such as Edinburgh and East Renfrewshire, the Tories enjoyed a rare glimmer of success in the Scottish leader Douglas Ross's home area of Moray in north-east Scotland, gaining three seats. Ross said: He said the Partygate scandal and the cost of living crisis had dominated conversations with voters. Read the full story from my colleagues Severin Carrell in Stornoway and Libby Brooks in Glasgow: Newly re-elected mayor Lutfur Rahman, who belongs to the Aspire party, hailed the size of his majority, which he claimed had increased from his previous terms in office. He said: Rahman suggested that one of his first acts would be to scrap low-traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs), which limit traffic in residential areas. Rahman said: Former Conservative leader William Hague has told Times Radio that a windfall tax on oil companies was not 'a crazy idea', and that 'if something is a true windfall, then there is a case for tax on it.'  He added that 'when you get a situation like this, where you get a huge additional profit, just because the global price of oil has changed, well, then there is actually a stronger case for it' Asked by Cathy Newman, about the fact that some Conservatives are wavering on windfall tax, he said: Asked if he personally backed a windfall tax on oil companies he said: Lutfur Rahman urged people to 'judge me on what we will do for you' after being elected as Tower Hamlets mayor. The controversial politician hailed the 'huge vote' that put him ahead of the incumbent, Labour's John Biggs, by about 7,000 votes. Rahman said: Labour increased its majority on Wakefield council in West Yorkshire, winning 45 seats against 13 for the Tories, three for the Liberal Democrats and two independents.  A parliamentary byelection is pending in Wakefield after Tory MP Imran Ahmad Khan resigned following his conviction for sexual assault. The Tories lost Monmouthshire, their only majority-controlled council in Wales, to no overall control.  Labour is now the largest party with 22 seats, the Conservatives on 18, five independents and one Green, PA News reports. Thursday's local elections were seen as a test of voters' mood after Partygate and as the cost of living crisis bites. Here are some of the things we learned. Boris Johnson's future remains in the balance Conservative MPs have repeatedly found reasons to prevaricate rather than take action against their beleaguered leader for breaking Covid rules. Perhaps not surprisingly, then, some were taking comfort on Friday in the idea that Labour appeared to have made only limited advances into the 'red wall' - and that the most catastrophic outcomes had been avoided (though suggestions of 800 or more lost seats always appeared outlandish). But these results are unlikely to have discouraged anyone plotting a coup. Labour won the popular vote, with the BBC's projected national vote share putting the party on 35% to the Conservatives' 30% - Labour's best performance on this measure for a decade. The Liberal Democrats are breathing down Tory MPs' necks across the south, from Jacob Rees-Mogg's patch in Somerset to Dominic Raab's in Surrey. And Labour looks likely to push the Conservatives into third place in Scotland, underlining fears that Johnson has become an electoral liability. Upcoming byelections in Tiverton and Honiton and in Wakefield may provide further evidence of that. Keir Starmer's path to No 10 may lie through a Lib Dem revival The Conservative party co-chair Oliver Dowden compared Keir Starmer's performance in Thursday's local elections unfavourably with that of Tony Blair in 1995, two years before he swept into Downing Street, when Labour gained 1,800 council seats. But there are other routes to power for Labour than a 1997-style landslide. The Lib Dems' gains across the south, from Somerset to West Oxfordshire to Raab's back yard of Elmbridge in Surrey, suggest the Conservatives could lose a swath of MPs outside Johnson's stomping ground of the red wall to Ed Davey's party. Combined with Labour gains in the red wall and a recovery in Scotland, that could be enough to deprive Johnson of his majority - though it would open up complex questions of what deal he might be prepared to strike with the Scottish National party, the Lib Dems, or both.

Addressing the seven-member politburo standing committee, China's highest decision-making body, specifically about the Shanghai outbreak, the president said China's response was 'scientific and effective'. He told officials to 'unswervingly adhere to the general policy of dynamic zero-Covid'. 'We have won the battle to defend Wuhan, and we will certainly be able to win the battle to defend Shanghai,' he said, according to a translation by Sinocism's Bill Bishop. China is the last major economy still committed to a policy of containment and elimination of the virus, despite the increased transmissibility of the Omicron variant, which has overwhelmed other previous zero-Covid jurisdictions. It has largely stuck to the measures employed throughout the pandemic - lockdowns, mass testing and movement restrictions based on health codes. China reported 4,696 new cases, including 4,269 in Shanghai and 70 in Beijing. Henan province, where the capital of Zhengzhou has just gone into lockdown, recorded 79. On Friday, it postponed the Asian Games, scheduled to take place in Hangzhou in September. New dates will be announced in the future, the Olympic Council of Asia said. But a weeks-long lockdown in Shanghai created a major crisis, with food shortages and delivery bottlenecks for the 25 million residents, and major business and economic impacts. It also prompted an unusual outpouring of criticism and protest, including on the merits of persisting with zero-Covid against Omicron. In his address on Thursday, Xi appeared to send a message to those wavering, saying: 'We will resolutely struggle against all words and deeds that distort, doubt and deny our epidemic prevention policies.' Xi's address also called out 'problems of inadequate understanding, inadequate preparation and inadequate work [and] resolutely overcome the ideas of contempt, indifference and self-righteousness'. An analysis of the speech by the China Media Project said the language should be seen as 'a direct criticism of unspecified local CCP leaders who have questioned the policies at the centre, or who have been insufficiently successful in applying them'. It added: 'And it is difficult not to hear in this phrase about 'self-righteousness' a condemnation of leaders in Shanghai in particular.'  Health experts agree with Chinese authorities that vaccination and booster rates are too low, and health resources too inequitable across regions for the country to risk opening up. However, analysts say the zero-Covid policy is now so entrenched in the political legitimacy of the Chinese Communist party and Xi that even when conditions change there is no way out, barring a major and potentially damaging backdown. Economists have forecast a worsening economic situation if Shanghai-style lockdowns continue. One analyst this week projected it would cost $257bn, 1.5% of China's 2021 GDP, by the end of the year if every tier-1 city employed the thrice-weekly testing regime currently operating in Beijing and other places. During the five-day labour day holiday, which ended on Thursday, there was a 43% year-on-year reduction in tourism spending. Rail journeys were down by more than 70%. In the capital, Beijing, authorities have resisted a city-wide lockdown, instead imposing movement and transport restrictions, activity and venue shutdowns, and lockdowns of individual residential compounds. It has ordered people from some districts to work from home, and reopened mass quarantine centres to house mild ", "8542a6a5b2a686c22e74a839fa7fa5a05d6d3ea8414866ca42a04533": "Three people have been killed and at least four more injured in the central Israeli town of Elad, in the latest in a spate of street attacks that have sent tensions soaring in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in recent weeks. Israeli forces have launched a hunt for two Palestinian suspects, backed by a large deployment of security personnel, helicopters, drones and roadblocks. Police said the suspects were 19 and 20 years old and came from the town of Jenin in the occupied West Bank. Medics described a horrific scene in Elad, an ultra-Orthodox town near Tel Aviv. Israeli media identified those killed as Yonatan Havakuk, Boaz Gol and Oren Ben Yiftah, three fathers in their 30s and 40s who together are survived by 16 children. Funerals will be held on Friday. Police said the incident appeared to be a terror attack and Elad's mayor called on residents to stay indoors during the hunt for the perpetrators. Late on Thursday the Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, said: 'We will get our hands on the terrorists and their supportive environment, and they will pay the price.' Witnesses told Agence France-Presse that two assailants leapt from a car swinging axes at passersby. The injured included two people being treated for serious wounds, health officials said. 'The joy of Independence Day was cut short in an instant,' the Israeli foreign minister, Yair Lapid, posted on Twitter. 'A murderous attack in Elad that shocks the heart and soul. We will not give in to terror.' The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, condemned the attack. The official Palestinian news agency, Wafa, quoted him as saying: 'The killing of Palestinian and Israeli civilians will only lead to more deterioration of the situation.' The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, tweeted that the US 'vehemently condemn[s] the terrorist attack in Israel today'. Details on how the violence unfolded remained unclear but several Israeli media reports said the assailants carried knives or an axe, while other reports suggested they used firearms. Paramedic Alon Rizkan, a first responder, described it as a 'complex scene' and identified all the dead as men in their early 40s. The majority of Elad's 50,000 residents are members of Israel's ultra-Orthodox community, hundreds of whom gathered in the attack area amid medical personnel and police. The worst wave of terrorist attacks in Israel in years began in late March, when an Islamic State supporter killed four people in a stabbing and vehicle-ramming incident in the southern city of Beersheba. Tensions then rose throughout the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which coincided with the Jewish festival of Passover. Several separate attacks in Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank carried out by Palestinians and Palestinian citizens of Israel claiming to be from different factions have killed 16 Israelis, including an Arab-Israeli police officer and two Ukrainian nationals. Three Arab-Israelis and 27 Palestinians have died during the same period, among them the perpetrators of attacks and others killed by Israeli security forces in stepped-up army operations in the occupied West Bank. The deadly violence has been accompanied by clashes throughout Ramadan at the Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem between Palestinians and Israeli police, in which hundreds of Palestinians have been injured. The site, known as the Temple Mount in Israel, is holy to both Jews and Muslims, and lies at the geographical and religious heart of the decades-old conflict. The compound's reopening to Jewish visitors on Thursday morning, after the Eid al-Fitr holiday, was again marked by clashes; after Israeli police moved to arrest one of the Palestinians protesting against the Jewish presence, scuffles broke out in which police fired rubber-coated bullets and Palestinians responded by throwing stones. Two Palestinians were taken to hospital and one police officer was lightly wounded, medics said. The Palestinian militant group Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip, praised Thursday's attack in Elad but did not claim responsibility for it. 'The storming of al-Aqsa mosque can't go unpunished,' Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem said. 'The heroic operation in Tel Aviv is a practical translation of what the resistance had warned against.' The escalation of violence in the past six weeks has raised fears of another armed conflict similar to the 11-day war a year ago between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, which was in part triggered by unrest at Aqsa. Informally, Jews are allowed to visit, but not pray at the site. In recent years, however, growing numbers of Jewish visitors, sometimes praying or with police escorts, have inflamed longstanding Palestinian fears that Israel plans to annex the area. Israel says it is committed to maintaining the status quo, and accuses Hamas of inciting the recent violence.

Trump's second defense secretary, Mark Esper, details the Oval Office outburst in a new book. A Sacred Oath: Memoirs of a Defense Secretary in Extraordinary Times, will be published next week. The Guardian obtained a copy. Esper's account of an extraordinary presidential question in the same meeting - 'Can't you just shoot them? Just shoot them in the legs or something' - has already been reported. Pence's inclusion in Trump's invective has not. Amid such revelations from the book, the New York Times related Esper's claim that Trump once proposed launching 'missiles into Mexico to destroy the drug labs'. According to Esper, Trump said 'no one would know it was us', because he would simply deny responsibility. Esper said he would have thought Trump was joking, had he not been looking at the president as he said it. Trump did not immediately comment. Esper writes that he helped block other such ideas from the president and his aides, among them proposals from the policy adviser Stephen Miller that the US should send 250,000 troops to the Mexico border. Miller is also alleged to have suggested severing the head of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, an Islamic State leader killed by the US, dipping it in pig's blood and parading it as a warning to other terrorists. Esper says he told Miller that would be a 'war crime'. To the New York Times, Miller denied the episode and called Esper a 'moron'. The former defense secretary's full account of the meeting at which Trump suggested shooting protesters, as Washington and other US cities were convulsed by protests inspired by the police murder of George Floyd in late May 2020, is equally remarkable. Esper's account of Gen Mark Milley's attempts to explain to Trump the role of the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff echoes others, including by the reporter Michael Bender in a book published last year and by William Barr, Trump's second attorney general, who was present but recounts a slightly different lineup of Trump aides. Like Barr in his own memoir, Esper does not stint when describing how he says Trump reacted when he was told Milley had no command authority over active duty or national guard forces Trump wanted to deploy. According to Esper: ''You are losers!' the president railed. 'You are all fucking losers!' 'This wasn't the first time I had heard him use this language, but not with this much anger, and never directed at people in a room with him, let alone toward Barr, Milley and me.' Esper expands on Barr's account of what the then-attorney general called a 'tantrum', saying Pence was also a target. 'He repeated the foul insults again, this time directing his venom at the vice-president as well, who sat quietly, stone-faced, in the chair at the far end of the semi-circle closest to the Rose Garden. I never saw him yell at the vice-president before, so this really caught my attention.' Pence was loyal to Trump until 6 January 2021, the day of the deadly Capitol riot, when he refused to attempt to block certification of Joe Biden's election victory. Like Trump, Pence is now eyeing a run for the presidency in 2024. Esper also writes that 'Trump shouted, 'None of you have any backbone to stand up to the violence,' and suggested we were fine with people 'burning down our cities'.' The former defense secretary then details the question about whether protesters could be shot. Esper says Trump did not attempt to order the shooting of protesters. Instead, Esper says, the president was 'waiting, it seemed, for one of us to yield and simply agree. That wasn't going to happen.'", "087031c74fddef2c3fb8300c1a264d74d5955f62001b008d4f738c40": "Joe Biden has named his new press secretary, after it was announced that Jen Psaki will leave the administration, expected to become a TV host at MSNBC.

Germany's DAX (-2%) and France's CAC (-2.3%) are also weaker. The selloff is being driven by Wall Street, where the S&P 500 index is down another 1%, adding to Thursday's selloff.

Accountancy professor Prem Sikka warns there will be 'tragedy' if the government doesn't give people more help with the cost of living crisis. Lower living standards are now inevitable for many Britons, the Bank of England's chief economist has told an online briefing, according to Reuters. Huw Pill also argued that 'some parts of society' need to accept that wages won't keep up with the surge in inflation. Here's Reuters' story:  Higher energy costs and more expensive imports mean many Britons need to come to terms with a fall in living standards and it is unreasonable to expect incomes to keep up, Bank of England chief economist Huw Pill said on Friday. 'What we are buying is becoming more expensive relative to what we are selling,' Pill told an online briefing hosted by the BoE. Britain's economy was heading for contraction in the final quarter of 2022, and the medium-term growth prospects were weak, Pill said. 'Maybe the benchmark shouldn't be that wage growth gets back to inflation growth quickly, because there is a need at some point for some parts of society to accept the reality that this real income squeeze is taking place,' he added. The BoE on Thursday raised its main interest rate to 1% from 0.75%, and forecast that consumer price inflation would exceed 10% in the final quarter of this year. Berenberg Bank don't believe the UK is facing two years of painful stagflation, as the Bank of England's forecasts suggest. The UK economy typically shows a high degree of cyclicality, they point out, in a note to clients. Real GDP performance is either good or bad, rather than simply mediocre.  So Berenberg reckon growth will either remain robust, or the UK will fall into either a technical or full-blown recession. The first is more likely, they say, but 'amid darkening clouds', the risks of a bad outcome are growing. According to Berenberg, there's now a 25% chance of a genuine downturn: Prime minister Boris Johnson has warned there is a difficult period ahead, but hasn't revealed any fresh help to support struggling families. Interviewed on Sky News following yesterday's local elections, Johnson was asked what he'll do to address the economic pain to come as inflation rises to 10%. Johnson says inflation has spiked around the world, driven by the cost of energy, and that the UK hasn't invested enough in domestic energy security, by neglecting nuclear power and not pushing renewables fast enough. But fixing supply side issues, especially on energy security, will protect people in the future, he adds. Q: Why not do a windfall tax on energy companies, so we can help people now? Johnson reveals he had the heads of Shell and BP in yesterday, and told them the country needs them 'invest massively in clean, green renewables, in stuff that will make a difference to energy prices'. Johnson cites windfarms and hydrogen, to ensure supplies are protected in the future. And he adds that 'clobbering' energy firms doesn't make sense:  [Projects are already underway, though. BP's spending PS18bn on North Sea oil and gas, offshore wind, hydrogen facilities, electric vehicle charging points and carbon capture projects, which wouldn't stop if there was a windfall tax]. Johnson didn't announce any fresh support, but did say PS22bn is already being provided. That total includes changes to the Universal Credit taper rate, the rise in National Insurance thresholds, the cut to fuel duty, the council tax rebate, and the PS200 energy bill discount which will be repaid on charges levied in future years. Our Politics Live blog has full details: Morrisons has put forward a last-minute rescue deal for the McColl's convenience store chain that could protect 16,000 jobs. The supermarket chain is understood to have offered to take on the ailing business as a going concern, assuming its debts, which amount to about PS100m, and taking responsibility for its pension scheme, which had a deficit of about PS3m when it was last assessed in 2019. Morrisons' deal was put forward late on Thursday night after McColl's, which has more than 1,100 small shops around the UK, including about 250 Morrisons Daily outlets and a number of Martin's, warned it was 'increasingly likely' to call in administrators. Here's the full story: Q: What would it take for the Bank of England to pause its interest rate rises? BoE chief economist Huw Pill says the Bank wants to see greater evidence that inflation expectations, wage and price rises, and economic momemtum were more consistent with its inflation targets (to get inflation back to 2%). Pill tells CNBC the Bank expects underlying wage growth to rise further in the next few quarters, for firms to pass on their cost increases to consumers, and corporations to attempt to restablish their profit margins. That's all natural in this economic environment, Pill says. But if they start to 'run away, or become unanchored like in the 1970s', then more rate rises could be needed. Here's a clip from his interview with CNBC's Julianna Tatelbaum. The Bank of England faces a tricky decision on how high to raise interest rates without hurting an economy on the brink of recession, says chief economist Huw Pill. Pill has told CNBC TV, following yesterday's interest rate rise, that: Pill wouldn't comment on fiscal policy (government spending and tax policy), but pointed out monetary policy (setting interest rates) has its limits.  That's why there's pressure on Rishi Sunak to work on an emergency budget to help families with rising costs of energy and food. Pill added the Bank is also worried about 'secound-round effects' -- the classic wage-price spiral where inflation pushed up earnings (as workers try to protect themselves from the cost of living squeeze). Bloomberg has the details: UK builders have been hit by a slowdown in new orders, another sign that economic growth is slowing, towards the brink of recession. Construction companies say the speed of recovery lost momentum last month, as higher costs and worries about the economic outlook hit demand. Worryingly, business optimism in the sector is now the weakest since September 2020, as prices of energy, fuel and raw materials jumped again. Firms continued to suffer supply chain delays, due to shortages of staff, materials and transport, port delays, and the war in Ukraine, according to the latest PMI survey of construction firms. Tim Moore, economics director at S&P Global, which compiles the survey said housebuilding took the biggest hit.  There were major delays and gridlock at the Port of Dover last month, partly due to an IT problem in the government's new trade portals, used by hauliers when shipping goods to the EU.

The supreme court is expected to formally overturn Roe v Wade, the 1973 case which established the right to abortion, in June. Danny McCormick, the state representative behind the Louisiana bill, said: 'We can't wait on the supreme court.' Since the draft ruling that seems set to overturn Roe was published by Politico on Monday night, Democrats have warned of a likely torrent of challenges to established rights. Joe Biden has sounded the alarm about threats to privacy-based rights including the rights to contraception (Griswold v Connecticut, 1965) and to same-sex marriage (Obergefell v Hodges, 2015). The president also raised the prospect of attacks on the teaching of LGTBQ+ children. On Wednesday, Biden said Republicans pushing such cases constituted 'the most extreme political organisation ... in recent American history'. The same day in Texas, the Republican governor raised the possibility of challenging a 1982 ruling which said states must provide free education to all children, including those of undocumented migrants. 'I think we will resurrect that case and challenge this issue again,' Greg Abbott said. Abbott is a prominent figure on the hard right of that Republican party, with rumoured presidential ambitions. Undocumented migration is a key issue in his re-election fight against Beto O'Rourke, a former congressman, and a central part of the national Republican party's approach to midterm elections in which they are favoured to take back Congress. Abbott was speaking to the conservative radio host Joe Pagliarulo. Pagliarulo said: 'We're talking about public tax dollars, public property tax dollars going to fund these schools to teach children who are five, six, seven, 10 years old, who don't even have remedial English skills. This is a real burden on communities. What can you do about that?' Abbott said: 'The challenges put on our public systems is extraordinary. Texas already long ago sued the federal government about having to incur the costs of the education program, in a case called Plyler v Doe. 'And the supreme court ruled against us on the issue about denying, or let's say Texas having to bear that burden. I think we will resurrect that case and challenge this issue again, because the expenses are extraordinary and the times are different than when Plyler v Doe was issued many decades ago.' Most progressive concern has focused on rulings which protect privacy rights, among them Lawrence v Texas (2003), which said it was unconstitutional to make gay sex a crime. Charles Kaiser, a leading historian of gay life in the US, said the draft Roe opinion 'so blithely disregards past precedents, it could suggest a willingness to overturn previous court decisions enshrining certain fundamental rights for LGBTQ+ people. 'One passage in particular set off alarm bells for activists who think its reasoning could jeopardise the court's decisions legalising sodomy and the right of members of the same sex to marry.' The conservative justice Samuel Alito, Kaiser said, 'cited those decisions and denigrated them by saying they used criteria 'which at a higher level of generality could license fundamental rights to rights to illicit drug use, prostitution, and the like''. Speaking to Bloomberg Law, Cynthia Soohoo, co-director of the Human Rights and Gender Justice Clinic at the City University of New York, said: 'The same arguments that Justice Alito makes against recognising constitutional protection for abortion can be made about ... the right to access contraception.' Katherine Franke, director of the Center for Gender and Sexuality Law at Columbia University, told the same site: 'Once you kick out the stilts underneath Roe there's nothing to rest those other decisions on. 'There's no constitutional foundation for the Lawrence decision saying that criminalising same-sex sex is unconstitutional, or the Obergefell decision that says same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry.' On the far right, Peter Brimelow, the founder of the VDare nativist website whom the New York Times has linked to the Fox News host Tucker Carlson, was reported to have greeted news of the draft Roe ruling by writing: 'Next stop Brown vs Board!' That was a reference to Brown v Board of Education, the 1954 case which ended racial segregation in public schools.", "df94bab97b4dda446a347d0563a910368acbe42e7d2ce185d6577050": "A Mexican journalist has been found dead in Sinaloa state, authorities say, marking the ninth death of a media worker in a unprecedentedly bloody year for the country which has drawn international scrutiny. Luis Enrique Ramirez, a veteran journalist and columnist at El Debate, was found dead on the side of a highway, the state's attorney general said on Twitter. Ramirez's body was discovered on Thursday by security forces in a black bag and wrapped in plastic, his employer said. Ramirez was a recognised figure in Sinaloa - in Mexico's north-west - and beyond, having worked at some of the country's largest papers across a 40-year career, according to El Debate. Ramirez had previously been on the receiving end of 'aggressions', said Juan Vazquez of Article 19, a human rights organisation dedicated to press freedom. Ramirez said in an interview with local media several years ago: 'I do feel the imminent danger that I am the one who follows, because there is a pattern [of murders] in which I fit.' Presidential spokesperson Jesus Cuevas said on Twitter on Thursday afternoon that the federal government would work with state and local governments to investigate Ramirez's death and that they would 'reinforce security measures for journalists'. Violence against the press has skyrocketed during president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's administration, according to an Article 19 report published in April. During his administration alone, 34 journalists have been killed, according to Article 19's count, including Ramirez. US senators Tim Kaine and Marco Rubio called on the US to urge Mexico to do more to protect journalists in February, criticising Lopez Obrador for lashing out against his critics in the media.", "ad08bbdf9b30e782b0ae1543fd86b132f47253816aa730101b45e240": "Peruvian prosecutors are investigating President Pedro Castillo and his wife for alleged plagiarism after a local television station said an investigation showed the couple may have copied more than half the master's thesis they co-authored. Panamericana television's Panorama program used a transparency request to obtain the text of the 121-page thesis and submitted it to the plagiarism detection service Turnitin. Panorama said the couple appeared to have plagiarized 54% of it from other authors. The station also said that two of the three professionals who validated the thesis did not exist in the national identity registry. Castillo and his wife, Lilia Paredes, both primary school teachers, used the thesis for a master's degree in educational psychology from Cesar Vallejo University more than a decade ago. The investigation is being carried out by a prosecutor in Tacabamba. Cesar Vallejo University has also appointed a commission to investigate. Castillo has denied plagiarizing his thesis and called the accusations 'malicious' and part of 'a destabilizing plan' against his government. 'The thesis work was validated by quality educational standards,' he said in a statement. He also said his academic work had an adviser and was supported by a jury that granted him the degree. Aggravated plagiarism is punishable by up to eight years in prison and generic falsehood with up to four years in prison. Accusations of plagiarism in Peru are not new. Two of Castillo's ministers have already faced similar charges. Castillo, a rural schoolteacher in a poor Andean district, took office last July and has since gone through four cabinets and survived two impeachment attempts in 10 tumultuous months in office.", "a89fffdef2a3c63ef27506c5aff94ed73ffe8f96369b57b0817e2df7": "Amber Heard continued her explosive counter-argument to Johnny Depp's claim of defamation, a narrative journey that on Thursday included tearfully recounting her contention that her former husband sexually assaulted her with a liquor bottle in an alcohol-fueled rage. The alleged March 2015 incident in Australia has been a focal point of the four-week trial, with details of how Depp came to sever the top of his middle finger sharply disputed by opposing parties. Depp has testified that Heard threw a bottle at him. Heard testified that the injury - which she said she did not witness because she had been given a sedative to sleep - came after Depp sexually assaulted her following a fight in which he accused her of sleeping with co-stars Billy Bob Thornton and Eddie Redmayne - accusations she denies. 'At some point he's on top of me, screaming I fucking hate you, you ruined my fucking life,' Heard testified. 'I'm on the countertop, he had me by the neck and was on top of me. 'My back was on the countertop. I thought he was punching me. I felt this pressure on my pubic bone and I could feel his arm moving. It looked like he was punching me. I could just feel this pressure,' Heard said. 'I remember looking around the room, looking at all the broken bottles, broken glass and I remember not wanting to move because I didn't know if it was broken, I didn't know if the bottle that he had inside me was broken.' Heard also described the aftermath of the night, finding her shredded burgundy nightgown used to wrap strips of raw steak and vulgar messages daubed in blood and paint around the house. Outside the house, she said Depp was still at work, trying to write more disparaging messages by urinating on a wall. 'His security looked at me and not laughed, played it off. It was like corralling a wild animal back into the house with his penis out of his pants,' Heard said. Heard testified that when Depp returned to Los Angeles he needed to get off cocaine before he could have surgery on his hand. 'I thought he might die or kill himself. Certainly seemed like the trajectory he was on.' Heard later contradicted the testimony of Depp's security guard Travis McGivern who had said that during a fight in Los Angeles, Heard had thrown a Red Bull can at Depp. Heard says it was Depp who threw a can, and 'took a swing' at her sister. After that, she said, she punched Depp. But Heard said that during another fight in December 2015, Depp had headbutted her - an accusation Depp denies. She testified that during that confrontation she felt that this was how she might die. Earlier, Heard told jurors that Depp was surrounded by security guards and assistants who enabled him to avoid the consequences of his drug and alcohol issues. The court was shown photographs of Depp passed out, which Heard said she starting taking in 2013 because he would black out and later deny what had taken place when he was intoxicated. 'He wouldn't remember, or he would deny it. There was no one to back me up - just his employees versus my word,' Heard said. Heard later testified about a trip to London in 2013, where she and Depp were filming movies, when Depp disappeared and came home so intoxicated that he was carried into their rented home 'like a baby' by a security guard. Heard testified: 'His assistants and other security guards were shaking their heads. I remember thinking: surely this is it. He was very sick for at least two days. I felt at that juncture very encouraged that we were on the same page ... that he had hit rock bottom. 'I understood enough about addiction to know you have to hit rock bottom, have some consequence to get better.' Depp, she added, got briefly sober. 'I thought we were on a good path to sobriety,' she said. 'I felt very encouraged that everybody and I were on the same page, and I felt encouraged that we were in a new chapter,' Heard added. But Depp soon relapsed, she said. The court was told that Depp and Heard's father ran out of drugs at the couple's engagement party, and her father left the party with Depp's security team to pick up more. Heard has previously testified about her father's heroin addiction. Heard testified that she had insisted on a pre-nuptial agreement. 'I wanted to eliminate any doubt in his mind and in other people's minds. So I brought it up to him and brought it up to my therapist,' she said. But Depp, she said, had ruled it out. 'He accused me of having one foot out,' Heard said, and told her 'the only way out of this is death'. Heard said that Depp would become angry if any of her movies were scripted with sex scenes. She said: 'Every time I got a script, it was what kind of, you know, how I was dressing? ... Did I have a sex scene?' Heard said she compensated for his jealousy by declining more sexually provocative parts or petitioning wardrobe managers to allow her to dress more conservatively. 'I had to eggshell or tiptoe around him when I had any kind of scene,' Heard said of the conflict. Depp, she said, hated that she worked with James Franco in The Adderall Diaries and had kicked her in the back on a flight from Boston to Los Angeles. 'He called me a slut' for the scenes, Heard said, adding how he accused her of liking filming the scenes. 'He was being really explicit about my body, about how I liked it. He called me go-getting, a slut. He asked if I was wet, why I wasn't looking at him ... did James do this and that to me?' The jury heard Depp 'howling like an animal' in an audio recording recorded by Heard on the flight. Depp, Heard said, had locked himself in the bathroom and passed out. After the Met Gala in New York, Heard testified, Depp had thrown a bottle at her. She told the court: 'He shoved me down on the sofa and at some point he just whacked me in the face. I suspected I had a broken nose. I remember it being swollen, discolored and red.' Heard testified that a team of detox doctors was brought into help Depp after the LA-Boston flight. The doctors elected to keep Depp on painkillers so he could finish filming, she said. But Depp, Heard said, was taking 'about double' the number of opiate painkillers he told his doctors he was taking. Depp, Heard said, would 'nod out' or fall asleep in mid-sentence. 'He'd been lying to them so he could get extra-high before he had to detox,' Heard testified. 'I didn't understand what was going on,' Heard said. 'I hadn't seen anything like this. I was trying to figure what happened.' In 2014, Heard said she started attending daily meetings of Al-Anon, a group for relatives and friends of people with alcohol addiction. Eventually, Heard said, Depp agreed to a detox program under the care of a team at his home in the Bahamas. But the process did not go smoothly, she said. 'He slapped me across the face, but he did so while he was crying,' Heard said. 'I shouldn't have been there. I don't know how to detox someone. I don't know why the doctors and nurses wanted me to be there. It was hell.' The court is out on Friday and all of next week, leaving jurors 10 days to mull Heard's testimony before Depp's counsel can mount a cross-examination.  This article was amended on 6 May 2022. The group for relatives and friends of people with alcohol addiction is Al-Anon, not Alcoholics Anonymous as an earlier version said due to an editing error. The latter is for alcoholics themselves.", "88f98883bf663795d31f36d988456298fce487e49012d93c8d36f0ee": "In June of last year, assistant district attorney Bidish Sarma sat before a pile of paperwork, more than 1,500 disorganized pages tall, rummaging for answers. It was a second-degree murder case file dating back to 1993, which had been in the possession of the New Orleans district attorney's office for almost three decades. Its secrets had gone untold until now. As he parsed the pages - old trial transcripts, police reports, witness interviews - he came across a series of handwritten notes that sent a wave of energy through his body and pushed his pulse rate skywards. The name Kuantay Reeder had not been mentioned in public discourse since July 1995. Then, buried in the back of the Times-Picayune, a short article recorded that the 21-year-old had been found guilty of murdering a man named Mark Broxton outside a corner store. The last sentence noted that the prosecution had largely relied on the testimony of a single eyewitness. Reeder had been held at the Louisiana state penitentiary, known as Angola prison, ever since. He had been sentenced to life 'at hard labor', forced to work while incarcerated, without the possibility of parole. He had, he said, maintained his innocence from the day he was arrested. He was now 49 years old. He kept three treasured possessions inside: a handwritten letter he received from his daughter at the beginning of his sentence, a skull cap worn by his baby grandson and a faded Polaroid photograph of his mother Shirley, a postal worker who raised him alone. He kept them under his pillow, and held them at night 'in time of darkness, when I think about dying in prison', he said. Realistically, there was little legal hope left. But as Sarma read through the handwritten interview notes, he began to realize that Reeder's conviction may have been based on severely flawed evidence, suppressed from public knowledge for almost 30 years. He called his boss, the chief of the Orleans parish civil rights division, Emily Maw. 'Holy shit, look what I found,' he told her. 'How is it possible that this has been sat on for so long?' That both Sarma and Maw, former non-profit defense attorneys, even had access to these documents was a small political miracle in itself - one that started with the 2020 election of New Orleans's new district attorney, a progressive firebrand named Jason Williams. Few insiders gave Williams much of a chance. He had already lost in a landslide for the same job back in 2008, and only had two endorsements from elected officials this time around. He also ran for election under a federal indictment for alleged tax fraud (that he maintains is politically motivated), which many viewed as the end of his political career. It was momentum that thrust him to a comfortable victory. A swell of protests had swept the country after the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, enabling a well-organized grassroots campaign to defy convention. Williams became one of a number of recently elected progressive DAs in major American cities - including San Francisco, Philadelphia and Los Angeles - swept to office amid a national reckoning on racial justice and increased public understanding over the powerful role local DAs play in shaping the US criminal justice system. The result shook the political establishment of New Orleans and made Williams something of an exception among prosecutors in the US south: an outspoken Black reformer operating in the center of America's mass incarceration crisis. 'When a legal system condemns, incarcerates and executes people because it prioritizes convictions over justice,' Williams said in a speech as he was sworn into office, 'then why would members of the public believe that doing the right thing will ever keep them safe?' In 2012, one out of every 14 Black men from New Orleans was incarcerated. While the number has fallen substantially since then, Louisiana remains America's most incarcerated state, with the New Orleans metro area sending more people to prison than any other location. The root causes lay in this state's racist past, but extend also to the practices of Williams's predecessors who have for decades responded to soaring crime rates with a perceived culture of win-at-all-costs prosecutions - seeking the toughest punishments possible, sometimes bending and breaking the rules to secure convictions in a system that often targets speed over due process. At the core of Williams's election was a pledge to change this. Among his first acts as DA was the creation of a new civil rights division run by Maw, a Brit and the former head of New Orleans's Innocence Project. Its purpose: to unabashedly confront the ills of the past. Although operating in a politically antagonistic climate exacerbated further by a new crime surge, the division has intervened in more than 150 old cases, leading to immediate release from prison in 128 instances since its creation. It has done so through a range of detailed investigations leading to resentencings, new plea deals and exonerations, making it perhaps the most active conviction review program anywhere in the US. For the past six months the Guardian has been given extensive access to the division, nestled in a corner on the fourth floor of the DA's office, a brutalist building where ugly, yellow light fills rows of symmetrical office cubicles, for a series of print and audio reports documenting their work and cases they have re-examined. Some, like Reeder's, have received no media coverage until now. Mark Broxton was killed on a warm spring evening in the neighborhood of Algiers on 13 April 1993. A gunman shot four times as Broxton used a payphone outside a grocery shop called Julian's Food Store. It was about 6.50pm. These facts have never been contested. But it took the district attorney's office two trials to convict Kuantay Reeder, an indication that the case was far from clearcut. The killing was one of 395 murders in New Orleans that year, the second highest annual total in the city's recorded history. The state's central witness was a 46-year-old man named Earl Price, who said he had watched the shooting from across the street. Price told the court in both trials the gunman had been facing him but was standing dozens of feet away across traffic when he opened fire. Price then walked into the food store, according to trial transcripts, and saw the gunman fleeing, later dumping a jacket into a dumpster as he ran away. Critically, the court was told by police and Price himself, that he had, without hesitation, picked out and signed Reeder's photograph from a lineup presented to him by police a full three months after the shooting. A second eyewitness named Norma Varist, who initially implicated Reeder, refused to testify in court and was jailed for contempt, in front of the jury, because of her refusal at the second trial. But hearsay evidence related to her identification was admitted without contest. Price recounted an elaborate story about watching the 21-year-old father of three die. Broxton, he said, had walked into Julian's after being shot four times, picked up a can of Coke and walked towards the counter to pay, but then collapsed into Price's arms. A forensic pathologist who also testified described this version of events as highly unlikely given the extent of Broxton's fatal gunshot wounds. The store's cashier (who could not be located for the second trial after the DA's office failed to disclose he was being prosecuted in a separate case) also disputed the account and said the doors had been locked after Broxton entered his store, meaning it was unlikely Price could have followed him in. But Price stuck with his story. 'I'm not going to change my testimony, regardless of how much you road hog me here,' Price said, according to court transcripts, as the defense poked holes in his account at the second trial. 'I'm gonna be in here with the same thing I seen. And I'm going to say it over and over again, until I'm dead.' Reeder recalled watching Price testify that day. 'It was like he was tearing me apart,' he said, as tears welled in the corners of his eyes. 'I had been trying to stand up and keep myself together, but it felt like he was taking a piece of me, and throwing it in the corner. Another piece, throwing it this way. Another that way. By the end I was bare bones. I was no longer me. I was no longer a whole person.' Three defense witnesses testified that Reeder had been playing basketball at a nearby housing project when the shooting occurred, and had eaten a meal with his mother after. But the prosecution was unflinching in its assessment, citing Price's testimony as key evidence. 'Kuantau [Kuantay] Reeder is an intentional murderer,' said the lead prosecutor, Michael Daniels, in closing, according to a transcript. (For the past 30 years, Reeder's name has incorrectly been spelled 'Kuantau Reeder' in all legal documents.) The jury deliberated for less than two hours. Reeder recalled feeling little for himself as the verdict was read. 'I was already dehumanized,' he said. 'The pain I was feeling was for my mother who sat behind me. My daughter. My wife.' He remained unaware for three decades that he had been convicted by an 11-1 non-unanimous jury. Louisiana has allowed such decisions because of a Jim Crow-era law designed to dampen the power of Black jurors; non-unanimous decisions have  disproportionately disadvantaged Black defendants ever since. In 2020 the US supreme court ruled the law unconstitutional. Reeder was taken to Angola prison, the sprawling maximum-security facility built on the grounds of a former plantation. And for his first 11 years inside, he was made to work out on the fields, tilling soil on the same land once toiled by enslaved people. 'No man, no animal, should ever have to work like that,' he said. Jason Williams's first day as district attorney started with an office littered with mess. Poorly labeled boxes were piled in his personal office and strewn across the grand jury room. Inside were case files, some left in wax-sealed seafood boxes to protect them from regular roof leaks. 'That lack of order and lack of systems really speaks to how this place has operated for a very long time,' Williams said one recent afternoon as he gazed out of his window on to the city's old jail building, a decaying concrete mass that towers over the horizon. 'It speaks to how the wrong person gets arrested and gets prosecuted and convicted.' Over the past few decades New Orleans has become infamous for so-called 'Brady violations' - named after the landmark 1963 supreme court decision Brady v Maryland, which established that prosecutors were constitutionally required to turn over all favorable evidence that might exonerate a defendant before trial. The city has been scarred by a series of high-profile Brady cases, many under the tenure of New Orleans's longest serving DA, Harry Connick Sr, who was elected in 1973 and, winning five successive elections, held office for 30 years. It was the exoneration of John Thompson, a Black man who spent 14 years on death row after being wrongfully convicted of murder and armed robbery, which brought the chronic issue to national attention. Just weeks before he was due to be executed, investigators uncovered a lab report showing the perpetrator's blood type did not match Thompson's. It was later revealed that one of the prosecutors involved had confessed on his deathbed to deliberately hiding the evidence from Thompson's defense. Years after his release, when Thompson lost a $14m compensation claim in a now notorious 5-4 supreme court ruling, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in her dissent that the case 'demonstrated that misperception and disregard of Brady's disclosure requirements were pervasive in Orleans parish'. She noted that the DA's office training manual at the time contained just four sentences on Brady. A later report by the Innocence Project found that during Connick's tenure, evidence had been withheld in a quarter of all death penalty convictions, nine of 36 cases. Four of those led to exonerations. In a rare interview at his home, Connick, now 96, sat at his desk, smoking cigarettes as he spoke. 'Do you know how many cases in 30 years that we prosecuted out there?' he said defiantly. 'Thousands and thousands and thousands. Was there a mistake made in some? Yes. But that doesn't represent what that office stands for.' He pointed to a hand-painted dove, a symbol of the Holy Spirit, that hung above his mantle. 'It is a moral violation, a sin, to charge someone with something they didn't commit or to charge someone when there wasn't sufficient evidence,' he said. 'That was the message I sent to my lawyers.' Asked his views on Ginsburg's famous dissent, he replied, unflinchingly: 'Ruth Bader Ginsburg is full of shit.' Kuantay Reeder had grown up in a tough neighborhood, the Fischer Projects in Algiers, and was no stranger to the harsh realities of life there. But the violence he witnessed in prison continued to shock him. From the time he said he was beaten by the police officers who initially questioned him back in 1993 to when he saw men crushed and cut in prison fights, and when he himself was involved in brawls during spates of torrid violence. After 11 years of grinding field work, Reeder said, he was granted 'trustee' status, earning greater prison freedoms and finding solace working in the gardens and learning about tropical plants - pansies, copper plants, birds of paradise. His wife, Vanessa Scott, had returned to him after a few years apart. She came to visit once a month, a five-hour round trip from New Orleans. They would sit in the visitation room together for a few hours, holding hands. 'To know that you have somebody love you that much that they're willing to stay by your side through something like this ... You can never shun that. Never wash that off. It's on you for life,' he said. But even as his mind eased on occasion, he still thought about his case. How he believed his name had been bandied around the projects, and how police had initially essentially pursued hearsay and gossip as a means to investigate. Reeder had known Broxton as a child, he had always said, but had not seen him in years. And no motive had ever been clearly corroborated at trial. In addition, there had been another suspect police investigated, who was later named in court in connection with the crime, nicknamed 'Bird'. The alternate suspect matched the physical description given by Price closer than Reeder. And he had, according to his ex-partner during a police interview, threatened Broxton from inside prison over a romantic dispute. He had later called her minutes after the shooting to say Broxton had been killed, according to testimony. She had earlier told police Bird had told her how many times he had been shot and where on his body the shots had landed. Reeder had made Brady claims throughout the post-conviction process, after his case was taken up by the veteran defense attorney Sheila Myers at the Tulane criminal justice clinic. She had been given access to a few hundred pages of documents under public records requests, and later uncovered that Earl Price, the sole testifying eyewitness, had a federal conviction for lying on a firearms application that had not been disclosed at trial. She argued in court that this further undermined his reliability as a witness and fought Reeder's case doggedly for over a decade. But successive state and federal courts had denied the applications for retrial, finding that the conviction was not substantial given the rest of Price's extensive criminal record had been known at the time. The applications were consistently opposed by the Orleans DA's office. In a quarter of all cases the civil rights division has re-examined, the DA's file is lost or missing, according to internal figures shared with the Guardian. In the vast majority of cases from before Hurricane Katrina, evidence held at the city's courthouse has been destroyed either by flooding from the hurricane or by court order. Maw had always expected to be re-examining unresolved Brady claims as part of the new civil rights division's work. But she was shocked to see such disarray among the records. 'If someone is saying my conviction is unfair because I think the state didn't turn over all the evidence, there is no way for us to go back and analyze whether that suspicion is true if we can't see what was in the state's file,' she said. 'You can't analyze whether there may be state misconduct if the records aren't there.' As of March, the civil rights division had received 204 claims of wrongful conviction from currently incarcerated people. The vast majority, 179, came from those without current legal representation - adding further obstacles to re-examination. In order to pull files from the Connick era, the civil rights division has relied on the assistance of a small records office in a windowless, rectangular office space on the third floor of the DA's building. Here, hundreds of small drawers contain tens of thousands of index cards. Each card a criminal case, documenting a record on microfilm. The drawers of microfilm, too, were damaged by humidity following Katrina, leaving many stinking of vinegar as they slowly decay. Until midway through last year, the division relied on a now defunct Konica Minolta MD 6000 microfilm machine (spare parts had to be ordered from eBay). Each page was scanned individually by volunteers. Eventually, following a donation, a modern machine was purchased. But the DA's file on Reeder had been preserved. It was over 900 pages, not the few hundred received by his lawyers in previous requests. And Sarma now had it in his hands. In a trial report, written after the first hung jury, prosecutors appeared to acknowledge inconsistencies in the lone eyewitness testimony. 'Each time [Earl] Price tells his story, it changes,' prosecutors noted in the report. In a memo before the first trial, in which prosecutors considered lowering the charges, they wrote of their 'star witness': 'We do not believe we stand a chance of getting a conviction on Price's testimony.' But in there, nestled away even further, were the handwritten notes discovered by Sarma that almost took his breath away. They revealed, in perfectly formed handwriting, that Price had on two separate occasions insisted that he had identified another number in the lineup during pre-trial interviews. The number corresponded to the alternate suspect, Bird.  Police had placed photographs of the alternate suspect (No 5) and Reeder (No 6) next to each other in the six-person photo lineup presented to Price. The handwritten notes revealed it was Bird's number Price twice insisted he had identified. In interview notes written on 19 October 1993, Price told investigators he had signed photograph No 5. (See note here.) In a follow-up interview with prosecutors on 27 December 1993, the notes are even more forceful, conveying Price was 'adamant' he had signed off on photograph No 5. A small diagram of the lineup is included in the notes, which suggest Price said at least four times during the interview he did not sign the photograph with Reeder's number. (See note here.) One line reads: 'Price says he picked #5 that would be [Bird],' listing the suspect's full name. (The photographic lineup presented at trial and shown to the jury, has been lost.) None of this information had been disclosed. Instead, it laid buried in a file for almost 30 years as Reeder fought to prove his conviction was unjust. Unreliable eyewitness identifications have contributed to 69% of wrongful convictions overturned by post-conviction DNA evidence, according to the Innocence Project. (There was no DNA evidence in the Broxton case.) The handwritten notes could have critically undermined the prosecution's case. They were potentially a major claim under Brady. It took six months for the civil rights division to reinvestigate the case. The work kept Sarma, a softly spoken, mild-mannered man, awake at night. 'I had a pretty clear idea of where things were going to go,' he recalled. 'But every day it takes to get there feels like a weight on your shoulders. That you need to correct something that is clearly an injustice.' They discovered that Price had died in August 2020, leaving many questions unanswered. Why had he insisted, on two occasions, he identified another photograph? Why had he changed this account at trial? And why was this potentially vital inconsistency never disclosed to the defense? A fragment of an answer, Sarma thought, perhaps lay in the notes, indicating that Price's signature may have made its way on to Reeder's photograph due to administrative error by a distracted detective. The notes reveal Price had told prosecutors that 'detective was typing while statement', and then told them again he expected 'his name will be under #5'. Sarma spoke to the old prosecutors, who largely defended their handling of the case. In an interview with the Guardian, Michael Daniels, the lead prosecutor, was dismissive of the civil rights division's work. He said he could not recall specifics of his pre-trial interview with Price on 27 December 1993 but stated that because Price's signature was ultimately found on the back of Reeder's photograph, 'the lineup spoke for itself'. He said he could not recall what he was specifically referring to in his first trial report, which stated: 'Each time Price tells his story, it changes.' 'His [Price's] signature was behind Mr Reeder, and the jury could have seen it with their own eyes,' Daniels said, pointing out he checked the original lineup after his interview with Price. Asked whether this clear discrepancy in the state's central witness's recollection should have been disclosed to Reeder's defense he said: 'You know, 20 years later, I can't tell you that I don't see some validity to that argument ... I'm not gonna say that that's 100% black and white. It is grey in my mind.' He added it was not a decision he made on his own, and that other prosecutors at the time had agreed they did not need to disclose. The division spoke to Reeder's original trial lawyer, now a city judge, who confirmed that if he had been aware of Price's critical inconsistencies on photo ID, they would have played a 'central role' in cross-examination. Sarma also confirmed that the alternate suspect had been released from prison the day before the shooting. In an interview with the Guardian, Bird, who has never been charged in relation to the crime, was presented with the allegations made against him during the police investigation and sworn to in court. He denied any involvement in the incident. 'I had nothing to do with that, nothing at all,' he said, adding Broxton was a friend of his. The suspect was also interviewed by the civil rights division as part of their reinvestigation. Mary Green had attempted to forget about the case from the day of the guilty verdict. Broxton was her oldest son. A handsome, fresh-faced 21-year-old, denied the opportunity to fulfill his promise as a father because of a senseless crime. Although he had fallen on hard times before the shooting, she had always prayed he would find his way. He left behind two daughters and another yet to be born. Green worked as a city bus driver when her son was killed, and was driving a route nearby when the shots rang out. She believed that law enforcement had faithfully attempted to catch her son's killer, but nearly three decades later she received a phone call from the DA's office that changed everything. 'I had never expected to go through it again because I didn't want to relive something I had put behind me,' Green said, her voice faint. But as the new facts were divulged to her, she felt a creeping sense of devastation, that the justice system had failed her and her son as well. 'I felt that if he [Reeder] was innocent of these charges then it was so unfair for him to have served the time that he did,' she said. A question lingered in her mind over the original prosecution. 'Was it just easier for you to prosecute Mr Reeder?' she recalled. 'Or was it just to satisfy me, knowing that I wanted to have someone to pay for the crime? Did they just do it for my sake?' Part of reckoning with past harms in the criminal legal system requires engaging with victims' families. News of the investigation was hard to comprehend. But the Broxton family threw their support behind the work. On completion of the investigation, the division was certain: they would argue Reeder's sentence should be vacated under Brady. But it would be left for a judge to decide. During its first year in operation, and despite the hundreds of cases on its docket, the Orleans parish civil rights division has operated with just two full-time attorneys and two investigators. But despite its small size, the work has made waves, often drawing outspoken criticism from the city's old political establishment. In May last year, the division moved to vacate the conviction of a man named Kaliegh Smith in another case involving significant Brady claims. It was revealed that prosecutors under Williams's predecessor, Leon Cannizzaro, had secretly paid the central eyewitness implicating Smith in a 2007 murder. In the Smith case, Cannizzaro issued a written statement accusing the new administration of being 'deceitful to the public' without, according to local reports, specifically addressing the nature of the Brady violation. It would not be the last time the former DA publicly criticized the work of the division. 'It's a very bizarre paradigm,' said Maw. 'We are still in a race, not against Cannizzaro himself, but what his office stood for. And it's not voluntary, it's because a very powerful political establishment still owns a lot of the discussion.' Throughout his investigation into the Reeder case, Sarma worried about how the public might perceive the work. 'I have felt at times like people are going to question our credibility to be doing this kind of work. So I think there is a heightened burden on us to dot every I and cross every T. I don't think that's a bad thing, we have to be thorough,' he said. 'What we want to accomplish is resolving cases that have been unfairly tried, but we also want to build trust in the community that we're doing this appropriately.' Perhaps looming larger over Williams's tenure, and the future of the civil rights division, is the DA's federal tax fraud indictment. Williams, who has pleaded not guilty, has long argued the 11-count indictment accusing him of inflating business expenses and avoiding $200,000 in tax over five years was politically motivated. He points to alleged threats his office received from a Cannizzaro operative after reports he would run for DA. 'The idea that talking about race the way I talked about it, talking about being smart on crime and criminal justice reform the way I talked about it, long before the campaign even started, put a target on my back,' Williams said. 'But I think it also helped me win this seat, because people saw the results of speaking out.' Cannizzaro has forcefully denied any involvement. A trial date is now set for July, and if convicted, Williams faces suspension from office. On a gray, humid morning in December last year, Reeder appeared in the same courtroom where he was sentenced in 1995. The wooden public benches were almost empty and Reeder was appearing from Angola prison on a Zoom link. Members of Broxton's family, including his mother, Mary Green, were present too. Reeder's voice boomed into the cavernous open room as Judge Rhonda Goode-Douglas asked him to confirm his presence. 'Yes ma'am,' he said, the words echoing off the walls. Myers and Sarma detailed the case before the judge. Myers described it as a 'frightening example of prosecutorial misconduct' under the Connick era, before Sarma invited Green to address the court. Her soft voice bounced around the room. She spoke directly to Reeder, as he looked intently down the camera. 'I'm speechless,' she said. 'I don't know what to tell you. Just how sorry I am that you had to ... that you served this time. I just pray that life out here would ... just ... be a better life.' 'Ms Mary, I'm sorry Mark is gone,' Reeder said. As Green continued to apologize, Goode-Dougles intervened, telling her not to blame herself. Later, she addressed both Reeder and the Broxton family. 'It is this court's sincerest apologies that this happened to both of you all: Mr Reeder, being wrongfully convicted and serving several years of your life in prison for a crime that you did not commit; and to the family of Mr Broxton ... we could never bring back your loved one. And, unfortunately, the criminal justice system failed you during that time period. It is my hope that you are all able to make peace.' The judge tossed the conviction under Brady. The DA's office dropped the charges. There was no way to ensure a fair retrial. Reeder's three-decade period of incarceration ended by a court session lasting minutes. Sarma addressed the Broxton family directly. 'We failed you,' he said. 'We have an obligation to seek the truth, which is really hard to do. But we also have an obligation to tell the truth, which is much easier to do. And it's something that we did not do in this case for nearly 25 years. 'We have come clean today.' He turned to Reeder. 'I would also like to apologize to you, Mr Reeder, on behalf of the state of Louisiana. I know it's been 28 years long, and today you'll get to go home a free man not facing these charges any more.' The court adjourned as sobs dissipated into the open air. Reeder became one of six exonerations the Orleans parish civil rights division secured within its first 12 months. Later that afternoon, Reeder walked out the gates of Angola prison, clutching two small bags with his possessions. Vanessa Scott, his wife, sat inside her car waiting for him. 'Come on king,' she called to him as he walked towards her in the drizzle. They hugged each other in a way that had not been possible since they were teenagers. 'It was shocking ... hugging her on the other side, knowing we were about to start our life again together,' he said. As they drove back home, along the winding country highway, they stopped at a church on the roadside, he recalled. The doors were locked, so Reeder bent down on the steps in the open air and prayed. 'It felt like I was immortalized or something,' he said, sitting in New Orleans a few weeks later, giving his first ever interview to a journalist. 'You know that whole feeling in your body changes when you know you're free. I felt everything come off me. 'I'm too overjoyed to be angry. I'm too overjoyed at being free.'", "8382ce505e9ba50df7a76472f25827fc1ed62e4278cff6349670fb9e": "Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but there is a new app to know about. BeReal, touted as the 'anti-Instagram', is currently the No 1 free app on the App Store in the US. It promises, slightly unnervingly, 'a new and unique way to discover who your friends really are in their daily life'. It works by sending an amber-alert-style push notification to all its users at once - one that includes two panic-inducing yellow warning sign emojis and a message that it is 'time to BeReal'. Upon receiving this missive, everyone uploads a photo of what they are doing at that exact moment in time, regardless of whether they happen to be dancing in a club with their friends or sitting alone on their sofa and staring at the wall. It also takes a simultaneous snapshot from both your front and back-facing cameras, which explains why this app is mostly being used by teenagers and not those of us who have matured into multiple chins. Crucially, you can't see anyone else's BeReal until you have posted your own. The app has grown faster than its French founders, Alexis Barreyat - who previously worked at GoPro - and Kevin Perreau anticipated when they created it in 2020, with many users complaining that the single photo permitted each day is taking for ever to upload. After setting up my profile on the app, I am shown possible friends of mine who are already there, being more real than me. They include two friends from university who don't use Instagram, a cool girl whose couch I stayed on in New York in 2014, the cool girl who's couch I'm currently staying on in Los Angeles, my editor, and a boy with whom I had a disastrous romantic affair in Denmark many years ago. I add them all, bar the obvious exception. The app also lets you see strangers' posts in the Discovery tab, and most users appear to be teenagers. BeReal's key ethos is authenticity. Its lack of filters and sense of urgency are designed to eliminate any notions of curation or artifice, words that have seemingly become tarnished by Instagram and its glossy influencers. You can't even see what the front camera is capturing to help you at least pick a flattering angle. My first BeReal was a slightly meta snap of me watching the TV, reflected in the mirror. My friend Tom, who is in Turin doing a doctorate, posted a photo of himself and his partner preparing asparagus for dinner. My editor posted a photo of a fish in a tank, and his best impersonation of said fish. Having reached the end of my 'feed'' with these three posts, I clicked back to the 'discovery' tab - which is a slew of strangers in mundanity: someone cooking ramen; someone sitting at a train station in London; a blonde woman on a sofa in Illinois watching baseball and drinking wine with a pile of just-wrapped presents on the floor; a young man in Brazil stuck in traffic; five teenage girls hanging out in a green stairwell; a lot of kids doing homework in their bedrooms. It succeeds at its goal of being drab, but why would anyone want an app to un-inspire them? Annoyingly, for the week-long duration of this experiment, my BeReal notification went off at some time between 4am and 7am. The app moaned that I was 'posting late' although it still allowed me to post, somewhat defeating BeReal's stated purpose. One time I offered it a photo of my morning coffee but pointed the front camera towards to the ceiling fan, because I did not want to post a picture of myself from below the chin first thing in the morning. The app patronizingly told me 'your friends prefer it when they can see your face!', which I would have to disagree with. Personally, I didn't feel these prosaic images represented my daily life at all. In my mind, my life is all palm trees silhouetted against beautiful sunsets and hummingbirds drinking from blossoms and the feeling of the sun on my skin - which are the things I post on Instagram. Life can be both authentic and beautiful at the same time, and pretending that 'real' life is always ugly and trivial seems like a miserablist's way to understand the world. My Instagram output may be curated rather than created under hostage-like circumstances, but ultimately it feels more authentic to me than a photo of my forehead and a half-eaten salad.", "48e521f8e2a8db35997452b4e93e2cd9c045a234e9a8a8536c010896": "", "fa66a93125bfc00c62b27f0257f9ca1a974073138175c9ecaf314458": "'All I've ever wanted in life is to be a farmer,' says Mike Duxbury, who lost his sight at the age of six through infantile glaucoma. Having grown up on the family farm, he was determined not to let the loss of his sight stop him chasing the only career he ever wanted. In the late 1980s, Duxbury applied to every agricultural college in the country before being accepted by just one - Warwickshire College of Agriculture. He qualified as an animal nutritionist and graduated in 1990 with a degree in agricultural business management. 'Even back then, prejudice was very high, but I learned at college to do the things I wanted to do. They gave me every opportunity; they never put up a barrier.' Today, Duxbury and his partner Ness Shillito have established one of the UK's first working farms dedicated to training people with disabilities for a career in agriculture. With 10 pigs, 10 sheep, four goats and 50 egg-laying birds, Inclusive Farm near Flitwick in Bedfordshire aims to give students the full range of skills expected on any British farm. It is now guiding disabled students from Milton Keynes College towards animal care qualifications. 'We are a working farm, and what students see and what students do is part of that working farm,' Duxbury says. 'They learn that animals need to be kept clean, fed and watered. I don't do anything with the students that a working farm wouldn't do on a daily basis.' For almost a decade after qualifying, Duxbury worked as a livestock specialist and a stud person for national farming companies. He then switched careers to work in telecoms. The money was good but the work was only a 'means to an end', so he kept on farming when he could. In September 2021, disillusioned by a lack of diversity in farming, he set out to prove a point to the world: disabled people should be able to participate in whatever industry they choose. With the help of local friends, he and Shillito began transforming a rented acre of overgrown green field into a working farm with disability access. The farm has been adapted for people with a wide range of physical needs, and Duxbury believes this would be possible across the industry. Each animal enclosure has a different frontage, with unique shapes cut into fencing so that by a combination of touch, sound and texture, Duxbury can move around the farm without assistance. 'From a tactile point of view, I've used different types of front. One will have a picket type front; one will have a post and rail; one a rail and a wire. They all help me at a glance. When I say 'at a glance', I mean I reach out my hands to touch. I know exactly where I am at any given point.'Matting is strategically placed around the farm so that the feel of the ground can be used as a navigational prompt: 'It means that, when I'm carrying buckets of feed and I'm with the goats, I'm not going to give them chicken feed.'It is not known how many disabled people work in farming, but the Royal Agricultural Benevolent Institution - a national charity providing local support for farming communities across England and Wales - estimates that 21% of all farmers experience problems undertaking their usual activities. Mark Thomas, of the Farming Community Network, says that many of the calls the charity receives are from farmers experiencing physical and mental health issues that can prevent them from carrying out their work. 'We tend not to get calls from disabled people looking to get involved in farming, but we often do from people where a farm accident or physical illness has become an issue while working on the farm.' At Inclusive Farm, electricity and running water have yet to be installed, but Duxbury and Shillito are already ushering their first intake of 14 students towards completion of their courses. Duxbury says: 'The beauty of it is that people from different backgrounds, communities and with different aspirations can bring something new to farming and make it more modern, wider-thinking and more 21st-century.' Beyond farming, his message to other industries is: 'When you are recruiting or have people who become disabled or have issues, instead of just throwing them on the scrapheap or ignoring them, talk to people like ourselves.' Dorset farmer Jyoti Fernandes, a policy coordinator for the Landworkers' Alliance, was raised by a blind mother and says that Duxbury's example has the potential to become a powerful force.'It's about peer support ... somebody who is blind themselves showing that you can just get out there and do it, and you can have job opportunities doing whatever you feel you are capable of. People should be allowed equal access to jobs - any job that they can perform while being disabled.'  Duxbury hopes to eventually expand across more land so that the farm can grow, teach students a wider range of agricultural skills and bring more products to market. 'We're trying to give people hope and a chance to stop thinking about limitations and start looking at what they really can do,' says Duxbury. 'We can cater for pretty well every disability. 'When I was at school, a lot of adults wanted to make decisions for us because we were that 'poor disabled person' who couldn't make a decision for themselves. But we can. 'The world is not like it used to be in terms of technology and attitude. There is plenty of room for people like myself to go and develop a career in whatever we choose to do.'

The warnings come as a leaked supreme court draft opinion and accompanying reporting from Politico show a majority of justices voted to overturn Roe v Wade, a landmark decision that has protected the federal right to an abortion for nearly 50 years. If the court's opinion does not change substantially from the leaked draft, at least 26 states would be certain or likely to ban abortion. Until the court issues a final decision, expected in June, Roe prevents states hostile to abortion from banning the procedure before a fetus can survive outside the womb. 'If this decision ends up being similar to what [was leaked], this is going to substantially affect abortion care, obstetrics care and healthcare more generally,' said Dr Nisha Verma, a Darney-Landy fellow with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Such a decision would represent a seismic shift in the American healthcare landscape, with devastating consequences for medical care, education and the doctor-patient relationship. 'It really starts with doctors, because overturning Roe will have a severe chilling effect,' said Lindsay Lewis, co-author of a report by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers that studied the potential criminal effects of ending Roe, and a board member of the same organization. Abortion restrictions are now more likely to contain extremely narrow exemptions to save the lives of pregnant people, severe criminal penalties for providers and to lack exemptions for rape and incest. That puts doctors in the position of trying to interpret legislation that is often extremely narrow. In one recent example, an Oklahoma abortion ban makes performing an abortion a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison. In addition, medical exemptions for the procedure are exceedingly narrow. An abortion can be legally performed only in the event the medical emergency 'cannot be remedied by the delivery of the child'. 'Medical emergency' is strictly defined as when a threat to a person's life 'by a physical disorder, physical illness or physical injury including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself'. Functionally, these restrictions on medical exemptions have made new abortion bans much stricter than even some that existed before Roe was decided, when some states allowed women to seek clearance for an abortion from hospitals boards on the basis of psychological crises. 'For basically the past decade, or a little over the past decade, these exceptions have simply become so narrow as to be functionally unusable,' said Elizabeth Nash, an expert on state abortion restrictions at the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research organization. 'There are very few people who meet these definitions.' In another example, should Roe fall, doctors who perform an abortion against state law in Alabama could be face up to 99 years in prison. 'This has the potential to turn the doctor-patient relationship on its head,' said Lewis. Doctors may not feel comfortable advising women they could go to another state to seek abortions, while women may be uncomfortable being open about speaking about her considerations. What's more, tough-on-crime laws passed in the nearly 50 years since Roe was decided mean some zealous prosecutors could charge doctors, and a host of other people, with aiding and abetting, conspiracy or accomplice crimes related to the end of a pregnancy. Abortion bans would also have a dramatic impact on medical education, in particular on residents in obstetrics and gynecology who are required to learn routine abortion care as part of training. 'Largely because of the politicization of obstetric and abortion care, the public sees these as two very different and separate things,' when in fact, 'pregnancy management and pregnancy termination are very interconnected,' said Dr Kavita Vinekar, assistant professor at the University of California Los Angeles school of medicine and a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health. 'A lot of the skills we use in obstetrics are directly related to the training we receive in abortion care.' A study co-authored by Vinekar found that nearly half (44%) of obstetrics and gynecology residents, or about 2,600 residents, will attend programs in states that could outlaw abortion training. Already, some programs have pioneered efforts to help residents from Texas, which banned abortion at six weeks in 2021 September, to travel to states where it is legal. But it is not simple or easy. 'I'm trying to think of ways to help, so there are not huge training and education deficits in our workforce, but I am also very nervous about it,' said Dr Jody Steinauer, a co-author of the study and director of the Ryan residency and training program at the Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health at the University of California, San Francisco. Additionally, Steinauer said she worries that workforce shortages will threaten pregnant people in states where abortion is banned, because few doctors will want to practice under the threat of prosecution, unable to provide safe, evidence-based care. 'Just the emotional distress factor would be enough to make people not want to practice in these states,' Steinauer said. Existing abortion restrictions, even as Roe stands, means pregnant people may seek abortion care far from where they live. Verma has seen patients come to Georgia from Alabama and Tennessee, which have more restrictions. However, the threat of prosecution may pose a threat. 'In too many of these cases,' a person who was prosecuted 'has come to the attention of law enforcement by someone from whom they've sought medical care,' said Jill Adams, executive director of If/When/How, a reproductive rights legal group. Although anti-abortion lawmakers often argue they exempt women from punitive statutes, laws that confer rights on fetuses have already resulted in prosecutions. Those criminal sanctions are likely to expand should Roe fall. That was probably the case for Lizelle Herrera, a Texas woman who was charged with murder for a 'self-induced abortion'. Charges were later dropped - abortion is legal because Roe remains the law of the land - but historians warn the case is a forewarning of things to come. There is no requirement for healthcare providers to report pregnant people to law enforcement for self-managed abortions, which are legal. 'In a time when we're trying to end mass incarceration, we will see far more women, far more people of color, far more poor people - these are the people we see getting abortions - being charged with crimes and going to jail simply for exercising what once was their right to determine what to do with their own bodies when it comes to pregnancy,' said Lewis.", "6aaef0db2dd9d20e56658ab1b7a329b6772c88c12a3a9d6374d9bc47": "Republicans were largely dismissive when, in 2019, a small group of extreme anti-abortion activists called on the party to reconsider its 'decades-old' view that laws restricting abortion in the US ought to exempt victims of rape and incest. It simply went too far, the party's House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, argued at the time, to support absolute abortion bans that did not offer protection to women and girls who had been raped or were the victims of incest. But there has been a sea change in Republican thinking since then. At least 11 US states - including Alabama, Oklahoma, Missouri, Arkansas and Texas - have passed legislation that bans abortion without any such exceptions. Where Republicans once believed that absolute bans were unpalatable and 'toxic' with voters, the party's legislators have now adopted the language once promoted by the most extreme anti-abortion activists in the country who say any such exceptions are 'prejudice against children conceived in rape and incest'. 'It is our view that the value of human life is not determined by the circumstances of one's conceptions at birth,' said one letter by proponents of absolute bans. 'A child conceived in rape is still a child.' While most of the laws have been blocked by US courts for now, the expected reversal of Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that made abortion legal in the US, would almost immediately, or as soon as practical, put the bans into effect. It means that in many states, restrictions on reproductive rights will be more extreme than they were before Roe was passed nearly 50 years ago. 'Something has changed, at least in Arkansas, and I perceive nationwide,' said Jim Hendren, a retiring state senator from Arkansas who left the Republican party after the January 6 insurrection and is now an Independent. While Hendren said he was proud of his long history as a 'pro-life' legislator, he said Arkansas had - until now - also always passed legislation with rape and incest exceptions. 'The fact is, it's a different ethical dilemma when you're talking about a 10-year-old girl who is a rape victim being responsible for the actions of a criminal, versus someone who is responsible for their own actions,' Hendren said. After years of 'closing every other loophole', Hendren added, 'suddenly the discussion changed'. 'You get to a place where there is nothing else to do. And there is no other mechanism for these [anti-abortion] organizations that have survived and thrived by working on this issue than to continue to push into this new area,' he said. Hendren, who noted that Arkansas had one of the worst infant mortality rates in the US, ultimately voted 'present' on the bill. While he drafted an amendment that would have included a rape and incest exception in the legislation, he did not put the amendment forward for a vote. It would not have had enough support, Hendren said, because even Republican legislators who quietly supported him and 'agonised' over their vote were fearful that supporting the amendment would mean they would be labeled 'pro-choice' by Republican primary challengers. Mary Ziegler, a professor at Florida State University College of Law who specialises in the history of reproductive rights, said it was difficult to judge what the exact impact of absolute abortion bans would be because so many sexual assaults and cases of incest are unreported. It was possible, she said, that the US could begin to see minors being forced to carry pregnancies to term, as has been the case in Ecuador and Argentina. Republican 'indifference' to rape and incest exceptions was 'something new', Ziegler said, and could reflect how groups that support such absolute bans no longer feel they need to 'tread carefully'. At the centre of the new movement is an advocacy group called Students for Life of America (SFLA), which has called itself one of the world's leading grassroots 'pro-life advocacy groups'. Among other legislative victories, SFLA has recently taken credit for thwarting 'backdoor efforts' to weaken the Arkansas legislation. On its website, the group emphasises its work across college campuses and includes pictures of dozens of young-looking staff members who lead the group's outreach efforts. But tax records show SFLA is far from grassroots: it has become a financial powerhouse in the anti-abortion movement thanks to the support of wealthy donors. Records show that the group transformed from an organisation with a budget of about $20,000 in 2004 to $12m in 2019. It is co-chaired by Leonard Leo, the conservative lawyer who served for years at the helm of the Federalist Society and was the legal adviser to President Donald Trump, where he had extraordinary influence selecting the conservative judges - including Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh - who now serve as justices on the supreme court. Leo is described in some tax records as SFLA's principal officer, which legally means he has the 'ultimate responsibility for implementing the decisions of the organisation's governing body, or for supervising the management, administration, or operation of the organisation'. Richard Crum, who is listed as a 'financial services executive' on the group's website and - according to LinkedIn - appears to be a top executive at CapitalOne bank, is another co-chair. Crum did not respond to a request for comment. Other board members include the former Wisconsin governor Scott Walker and Greg Mueller, a conservative strategist and president of Creative Response Concepts, whose clients have included Leo's Federalist Society. While SFLA does not list its donors in its own tax records, tax filings by other groups who have donated to the organisation show that donors include: the Apollos Charitable Foundation, a Texas-based group run by the Hetland family, who previously owned a Houston-based insurer called American Financial & Automotive Services; the Prince Foundation, the Christian charity in Michigan headed by Elsa Prince, the mother of the Blackwater founder Erik Prince and his sister, former education secretary Betsy DeVos; and Gerard Health Foundation, which was founded by Raymond Ruddy, a millionaire businessman and donor to conservative causes like abstinence-only education policies. Ruddy also serves on SFLA's board. On its website, the group said it relied on an unnamed 'angel investor' for helping it to 'grow rapidly' and become the voice of the 'pro-life generation'. The group's longtime executive director, Kristan Hawkins, did not respond to the Guardian's questions about Leo or other board members' role in the organisation. Hawkins, who has said that in her 'ideal world' the pill and IUDs would be 'illegal', recently praised the Oklahoma governor, Kevin Stitt, for signing a 'life at conception' bill which she said was 'sponsored' by SFLA and would make all abortion illegal, except in cases where a mother's life was in immediate danger. If it survives legal challenges - which it could if Roe is completely overturned - the absolute ban would take effect on 1 August and would make performing an abortion a felony, punishable by 10 years in prison. A separate bill signed by Stitt this week makes all abortions illegal after six weeks and takes effect immediately. Oklahoma had become a destination for women in Texas seeking abortions who were prohibited from receiving the procedure following that state's near ban on abortion.

There are about 11,000 species of bird spanning the globe, but the populations of half of them are falling, while just 6% are increasing. Their flight and song make them easier to study than many animals, meaning they are the best studied large group. Bird populations are also affected by all the damage caused by human activity, from the destruction of wild habitat, the climate crisis, and pesticides and other pollution, to over-hunting and impacts of alien species and disease. This makes them the best living indicators of global change, the scientists said. Billions of birds have been lost in recent decades in North America and Europe alone, and while there are more species in the tropics, a higher proportion are at risk of extinction in temperate and largely richer nations, the review found. Conservation efforts have been successful at rescuing individual species in specific locations from the brink, but political will and funding are needed to reverse the global decline, the researchers said. 'Birds are a much more powerful taxa [than others] to tell us a story about the health of the planet,' said Alexander Lees, at Manchester Metropolitan University, UK, and who led the review. 'We know so much about them - we don't even know how many insect species there are.' 'Currently, we're triaging the species at risk, but we're not stopping the flow of species towards extinction,' he said. 'There's only so much we can do with site-based conservation.' While conservation work has improved populations of 70 species enough to lower their risk of extinction since 1988, 391 species have deteriorated, the review found. Global data collated by Birdlife International underpinned the review and the conservation group's CEO, Patricia Zurita, said: 'Birds truly are the canary in the coal mine as indicators for the health of our planet, given their sensitivity to ecosystem changes, their ubiquity around the planet, and how well studied they are. [We] need to listen and act upon what birds are telling us, as they disappear ever faster.' One exception to the broader decline is among water birds, where populations living in wetlands in North America and Europe have grown by 13% since 1970. The restoration of relatively small wetland areas can have a huge impact, while birds living in grasslands and forests need much bigger areas. The review, published in the journal Annual Review of Environment and Resources, found that 48% of bird species are known or suspected to be undergoing population declines, compared with 39% with flat trends, 6% showing increases and 7% with unknown trends. Most long-term data is from Europe, North America, India and some sites in Africa but more recent monitoring in Latin America and Asia shows similar results. The population of birds in the US and Canada has fallen by 3bn since 1970, while 600m have disappeared from Europe since 1980. The review notes the extraordinary range of birds, from Antarctic petrels nesting 200km inland in Antarctica to the Hornby's storm-petrel found nesting in the Atacama desert. A Ruppell's vulture has been reported flying at an altitude of 11,300 metres, while emperor penguins can dive more than 500 metres below the sea surface. Birds have huge cultural value but are also vital to ecosystems, including dispersing seeds and eating pests. Birds are affected by all the impacts of human activity. For example, 2.7m are estimated to die every year in Canada alone from eating pesticides, while domestic cats may kill 2.4bn a year in the US. The most threatened families of birds are those which are larger and take longer to reproduce, including parrots, albatrosses, cranes and stocky birds like the Australian brushturkey. All countries host at least one globally threatened bird species and 10 nations have more than 75, the review found. Farmland species are declining precipitously, the review said, down 57% in Europe since 1980. This is due to the intensive agriculture that supplies cheap food, Lees said, adding: 'If we want farmers to farm wildlife, we have to pay for that as a society.' Individual species have been rescued, such as the Mauritius kestrel, which was down to one breeding female but has now been revived to a population of hundreds, and the Alagoas curassow in Brazil, which was extinct in the wild but has been restored from birds held by private collectors. But the review concluded: 'The growing footprint of the human population represents the ultimate driver of most threats to avian biodiversity. A lack of progress in conserving [birds] usually reflects a lack of resources or political will, rather than a lack of knowledge of what needs to be done.' Prof Stuart Pimm, at Duke University, US, said the review was excellent and authoritative, even with the sparse availability of data in some regions. 'What is certain is that about two-thirds of all bird species live in tropical forests, and human actions are shrinking those habitats,' said Pimm. 'Even without detailed population estimates, their numbers are surely in decline.' Lees said people need not feel powerless in helping to reverse the decline but added: 'We all have connections [to birds]. If a company is associated with deforestation in Brazil, don't buy stuff from them,' he said. 'And if everyone spares as much land as possible within their gardens for nature, then that adds up to quite a large area. Another lever is voting - we get the politicians we vote for.'", "ce84f362d35c6513c0f259082425c2ba9277d1f0d5d3b46ee8824827": "Replacing 20% of the world's beef consumption with microbial protein, such as Quorn, could halve the destruction of the planet's forests over the next three decades, according to the latest analysis. The move would also halve emissions from the global food system, by reducing the razing of trees and the methane emissions from livestock. Previous studies have found meat alternatives have lower environmental footprints but this latest analysis is the first to assess what impact that could have in the world. Deforestation also devastates wildlife but is proving very difficult to stop. Experts say the best way is to cut demand for the products driving the destruction, such as replacing them with greener alternatives. Microbial protein is brewed in warm bioreactors, like beer, with the microbes fed sugar. The protein-rich product could taste and feel like meat, and be as nutritious, the researchers said. Today, 83% of farmland is used for livestock and their feed crops, but the meat and dairy produced accounts for only 18% of the calories consumed by humans. The production of ruminant meat - mostly beef, but also lamb and goat - has more than doubled since 1961, but a series of studies have shown meat-eating in rich nations must fall drastically to beat the climate crisis. 'The food system is at the root of a third of global greenhouse gas emissions, with ruminant meat production being the single largest source,' said Dr Florian Humpenoder, a researcher at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) in Germany who led the study. 'The good news is that people do not need to be afraid they can eat only greens in the future. They can continue eating burgers and the like, it's just that those burger patties will be produced in a different way.' The research focused on microbial meat as it had been produced at industrial scale for 20 years and was already available, said Dr Isabelle Weindl, also at PIK. 'Even accounting for the sugar as feedstock, microbial protein requires much less agricultural land compared [with] ruminant meat.' Previous studies have shown the protein quality of microbial meat is equivalent to beef but it requires 90% less land and water and produces 80% less greenhouse gas emissions. The study, which was published in the journal Nature, used computer models that included middle-of-the-road projections of socioeconomic factors such as rising demand for beef, growing world population, increases in income and shifts in international trade. The 56% reduction in deforestation - 78m hectares (193m acres) - resulting from one-fifth of beef being replaced by microbial protein occurred in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. Significant deforestation still occurred in the modelling due to the production of other foods, such as palm oil and cocoa. The researchers found the substitution of microbial protein largely cancelled out projected rises in demand for beef, meaning new areas of pasture did not need to be cut into forests. Increasing the proportion of beef replaced to more than 20% resulted in diminishing returns because much of the deforestation had already been prevented, with a 50% replacement leading to an 82% cut in deforestation by 2050. Microbial protein can be produced from a range of microorganisms, including bacteria, but the main source on the market today is produced from fungi, with the market leader being Quorn. 'The best meat alternative is to eat less,' said Humpenoder. 'But [microbial protein products] can make it easier for people to switch away from meat.' The study did not analyse the effect of plant-based alternatives to meat, but these would also be expected to significantly cut environmental impacts. Meat cultured in bioreactors from animal cells is still in early stages of development and was not included in the study because of a lack of suitable data. Dr Tilly Collins at Imperial College London, who was not part of the study team, said: 'While the predictions of these models depend strongly on our ability to deliver such protein substitution, there is no doubt that the efficiency of biotech-enabled alternatives offers huge future potential for more sustainable food provision. 'Governments and food production business need to coordinate to develop appropriate standards [for microbial protein] and thus future public confidence. Our nuggets may never be the same again.' The bioreactors used to create microbial protein require heating, and using high-carbon sources of electricity would offset part of their benefit, but green electricity is expanding quickly as costs continue to fall. Humpenoder said: 'Microbial protein should not be seen as a silver bullet, but rather as a building block in a large transformation of the whole food and agricultural system, combining it with reductions in food waste, incentives to eat healthier, and de-incentivising the sale of products with high environmental impacts.'", "1e78697474c588bd6e1c380e99e1abe4ea32a18f5db2f3d84e30c07e": "A scientist has started a national investigation into curlews, after noticing in a small-scale study that some of the eggs being laid by the endangered birds were unusually fragile and crumbly. If it emerges that the problem is widespread, the fragile eggs could pose a grave risk to the future of the species, which has declined significantly in Scotland, England and Wales and by 42% between 1995 and 2008 in the UK overall. Dr Nicola Hemmings, a researcher in the school of biosciences at the University of Sheffield, started working with the Curlew Recovery Partnership (CRP) conservation group last year. She said: 'I looked at a very small number of eggs because the CRP thought there might be some fertility issues. All of them were fertilised and showed some sign of embryo development but at least half of them had flaky, brittle or crumbly thin fragile shells. We have this hint there could be a problem here. It's worth noting that those eggs with particularly thin shells had embryos that died in particularly late development.' This finding worried her, so she asked the partnership to get samples from across the UK to see if it was widespread and whether there was any pattern with regard to egg quality and hatching success. Nest monitors have been asked to send failed eggs and egg fragments to Hemmings, who will be analysing them to find out why they are becoming so crumbly. 'We want to assess what degree this is a threat to the recovery of the curlew,' she said, adding: 'The first step is to find out if this issue is widespread, then the next step will be to try to identify what the problem is, so what's causing the problem with these eggshells. We will analyse eggshell samples to look for environmental contaminants that might be leading to poor eggshell quality and also look for evidence of poor nutrition.' If researchers are able to identify a problem, conservation teams could work with landowners in the area to reduce the pollution near curlew sites, or help the birds that are not finding enough food. If the issue is inbreeding because of the constricted population, rather than something that is easier to fix, such as environmental pollution, the outlook would be poor. However, there are hopes inbreeding may not be the problem. Hemmings said: 'The one thing that did seem quite hopeful from our analysis last year was that the fertility issue didn't seem to be a massive problem. These eggs were fertilised, which is the first thing people think of with respect to genetic or inbreeding problems. Doing this kind of UK-wide assessment will help us identify whether there are any problems with particular pockets and if there are any fertility issues arising.' It is important that members of the public do not disturb nest sites, but conservationists involved in the study have been asked to keep an eye out for failed eggs, which they need to get into a fridge before sending them for analysis. They have also been asked for larger fragments from hatched eggs, to enable analysis of shell thickness at a range of locations. The loss of the curlew has been most dramatic in the lowlands, and it is estimated there are most 300 pairs below Birmingham . It is thought these birds could die out in eight years if nothing changes. The curlew was added to the UK red list in 2015. Prof Russell Wynn, who runs the CRP, said: 'The UK and Ireland holds a quarter of the world's breeding curlews, mostly concentrated in upland areas of northern England and Scotland. However, after dramatic declines in recent decades, they are now at real risk of extinction as a breeding bird across Ireland, Wales, and much of lowland England. 'In these areas we are seeing existing populations becoming increasingly isolated, and a lack of breeding success means there is a risk that they are now dominated by ageing and potentially infertile birds. This new research project will therefore inform conservation efforts in these areas by identifying causes of egg failure, and potentially also alerting us to impacts of chemical pollutants and/or poor nutrition on curlew breeding and wintering grounds. 'There was a recent study that basically showed the biggest kind of block for population recovery in the curlew is the early reproductive stages - the hatching and successful survival of young chicks. Every egg is crucial and every clutch is crucial.'", "1b5c633dd9fb024aa31f26840a63055ffe683818221c0ecaac57287f": "The accused head of Colombia's Gulf Clan cartel is due to appear in a federal court in New York on Thursday, as victims in his home country call for guarantees that he will come clean on atrocities committed by the feared paramilitary fighters he once commanded. Dairo Antonio Usuga, who is Colombia's most wanted drug suspect for nearly a decade, was extradited from Colombia late on Wednesday on cocaine and weapons charges. In images shared by local media during his extradition, the former warlord better known by his alias Otoniel, was seen handcuffed and with a wan smile, surrounded by officers.  Otoniel's capture in October was described at the time by President Ivan Duque as the biggest blow to the country's drug trade since the death of Pablo Escobar in 1993. But victims of the country's decades-long civil war are calling for the 50-year-old trafficker to reveal all he knows about atrocities he oversaw or was privy to. Otoniel's forces are widely believed to have operated with at least the tacit approval of some local politicians and security forces. Otoniel already faces over 120 charges in Colombia on allegations of murder, illegal recruitment, kidnapping for ransom, sexual abuse of minors, terrorism, illegal possession of weapons and drug trafficking. 'As victims we already know who Otoniel is - and we don't care. What we most need to know is who supported and sponsored him, and that includes the politicians,' said Jose David Ortega, a spokesperson from a campesino organisation in Cordoba, the northern province where the Clan del Golfo still terrorises communities and assassinates local leaders. 'So we are worried that he won't tell the truth in the US, but will remain silent on what he knows.' The warlord's long career played out in the shadows of the interwoven political and drug violence which have dogged Colombia for decades. Otoniel and his brother - who was killed in 2012 - were once members of a now-defunct Maoist rebel faction, the Popular Liberation Army, before switching sides to join their far-right paramilitary enemies, the Cordoba and Uraba Peasant Defense Forces (ACCU). When Colombia's paramilitary groups disbanded in 2006, Otoniel refused to turn in his rifle and remained in the criminal underworld. 'The extradition creates obstacles in learning the truth about the armed conflict, and the relationship between armed groups, business people and politicians,' said Pedro Piedrahita Bustamante, a professor of political science at the University of Medellin. 'So, while an alleged drug war win in Colombia is celebrated, the conflict rumbles on and the victims are forgotten.' Gustavo Petro, the leftist frontrunner in Colombia's presidential election campaign, expressed support for Otoniel's victims. 'Extradition proceedings should prioritize the confessions that victims need,' tweeted Petro. 'There is no interest that can be above the victims of violence in Colombia.' Authorities in Colombia said that Otoniel - who is currently being held at the same Manhattan jail that once held the Mexican drug lord Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, oversaw the shipment of 200 tonnes of cocaine a year. But for those that live in territory once controlled by Otoniel little is expected to change. 'They can take down Otoniel but the criminal organisation will remain,' said Ortega. 'As we like to say 'the king is dead - long live the king.''", "99c585c7d38a84b7639c06aef19047e4f5dfaf7b31a03ae9e5ad7fbc": "Pope Francis authorised spending up to EUR1m (PS850,000) to free a Colombian nun kidnapped by al-Qaida-linked militants in Mali, a cardinal has testified, revealing previously secret papal approval to hire a British security firm to find the nun and secure her freedom. Cardinal Angelo Becciu's testimony could pose serious security implications for the Vatican and the Catholic church, since he provided evidence that the pope was apparently willing to pay ransom to Islamist militants. Ransom payment are rarely if ever confirmed, to dissuade future kidnappings, and it is not known how much - if any - Vatican money ended up in the hands of the militants. Becciu, who was once one of Francis's top advisers as the No 2 in the Vatican secretariat of state, had withheld his testimony from the Vatican tribunal for nearly two years as a matter of state and pontifical secret. But he spoke freely on Thursday in his own defence after Francis released him from the confidentiality requirement. Becciu is one of 10 people accused in the Vatican's sprawling financial fraud trial, which originated in the Holy See's EUR350m investment in a London property and expanded to cover other alleged crimes. Prosecutors have accused the defendants of a host of crimes in allegedly fleecing the Holy See of millions of euros in fees, commissions and bad investments. Becciu, the lone cardinal on trial, is accused of embezzlement, abuse of office and witness tampering, all of which he denies. On Thursday his testimony covered the charges concerning his relationship with Cecilia Marogna, an Italian self-styled intelligence specialist who is also on trial on embezzlement charges. Vatican prosecutors accuse Marogna of embezzling EUR500,000, citing bank records from her Slovenian holding company that show wire transfers from the Vatican for unspecified humanitarian ends, and expenditures out of the account for high-end luxury goods. Becciu testified on Thursday that he hired Marogna as an external security consultant, impressed by her grasp of geopolitical affairs and the trust she enjoyed of two of Italy's top secret service officials, who accompanied her to a meeting in the Vatican. Becciu said he turned to Marogna for help after the February 2017 kidnapping of a Colombian nun, Sister Gloria Cecilia Narvaez, in Mali. She had been taken by al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, which has bankrolled its insurgency by kidnapping westerners. During her captivity, the group periodically showed Narvaez on video asking for the Vatican's help. Becciu said he brought the matter to Francis as well as Marogna, who he said advised him that she could work with a British intelligence firm, The Inkerman Group, to secure the nun's release. He testified that Francis authorised him to proceed with the Inkerman operation, and forbade him from telling anyone else about it, including the Vatican's police chief. Francis was concerned about the security and reputational implications if the news leaked, Becciu said. Becciu said he and Marogna met Inkerman officials at their London office in mid-January 2018. Inkerman officials said there were no assurances of success and that the total expenditure could reach EUR1m, Becciu said. Because the Vatican wanted to remain external to any operation, Marogna became the key intermediary and the one to receive periodic payments from the Vatican secretariat of state for the operation, Becciu testified. Becciu said he told Francis about the London meeting in January 2018, while the pope was en route to Peru. 'He listened to me and confirmed my intention to proceed,' Becciu testified. At a subsequent meeting in Rome, Becciu said the fee could total 'about EUR1m, part to pay for the creation of a network of contacts, and part for the effective liberation of the nun.' Becciu testified: 'I pointed out that we shouldn't have gone beyond that figure. He approved. I must say that every step of this operation was agreed with the Holy Father.' Narvaez was released in October 2021 after more than four years in captivity. Soon afterwards, she met Francis at the Vatican.

The party's rebranding was announced just as campaigning was due to begin for June's parliamentary elections. Macron is hoping to secure a parliamentary majority against competition from a new alliance of leftwing parties led by Jean-Luc Melenchon, and Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally, which is seeking to increase its small number of seats. The name Renaissance meant 'always choosing enlightenment over obscurantism', its secretary general, Stanislas Guerini, told a press conference in Paris. Macron's grouping had previously used the name Renaissance during its European election campaign in 2019. 'Political parties have to reinvent themselves in order to continue to exist,' Guerini said, in a barbed reference to the poor presidential showing of the two former parties of government, the Socialists and Les Republicains, whose candidates Anne Hidalgo and Valerie Pecresse had a combined score of less than 7% in the presidential election last month, in which Macron beat the far-right Le Pen in the final. The name change was also intended to help Macron's party gain ground in local government, which it has failed to do over the past five years. 'It will be a party of the people, open to citizens,' Guerini said, saying all expertise was welcome, particularly from local elected officials who could join. Macron had created the political movement En Marche! (On the Move) in 2016 when he was economy minister, as a vehicle for his presidential bid in 2017. It was classed as 'neither left nor right' and was presented at the time as deliberately unconventional. It used Macron's own initials, EM, and had a handwritten logo that was Macron's own writing, with no specific colour, unlike the rigid colours of the old party system. En Marche was then renamed La Republique En Marche - The Republic on the Move - for the 2017 parliamentary elections, where Macron won a majority. In next month's parliament elections, the new Renaissance party will team up with two other centrist parties: its traditional allies in the MoDem party, which supported Macron in the presidential election, as well as the new Horizons party, set up by Macron's former prime minister, Edouard Philippe. They will form a coalition under the banner Ensemble (Together). Francois Bayrou, head of the MoDem party, told the Paris press conference that the coalition of centrists shared a sense of the 'seriousness' of the current mood of political 'divisions' in France. He said that opposition parties' ideas were 'more radical' and 'more risky' for France and Europe.", "102b7e424ff282f2ced0ab2c0d07dd23574dfc6db25444619d5f376e": "Donald Trump's former attorney Rudy Giuliani is not expected to appear at an interview scheduled for Friday with the House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol attack, throwing into jeopardy the prospect of his cooperation, say sources familiar with the matter. The move by Giuliani to cancel his appearance after the panel declined his request to record the interview means it may not secure documents and testimony from a central figure in Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election in time for public hearings in June. Giuliani was expected to have revealed his contacts with Republican members of Congress and other matters not covered by executive privilege or attorney-client privilege as part of a cooperation deal that his lawyer had been negotiating for months, the sources said. The former attorney to the president had also indicated to the select committee that he was prepared to turn over materials about Trump's schemes to return himself to office on January 6 that House investigators had outlined in a subpoena issued earlier this year. But, as the Guardian first reported in February, Giuliani told the panel he would only appear for an interview if it was not pursuant to that subpoena - in part because he considered the investigation illegal - and does not have to violate any claims of privilege. The select committee has conceded that Giuliani cannot violate privilege, the sources said, making a deal attractive to Giuliani, who can avoid being held in contempt of Congress by providing information the panel could not otherwise get - while also not giving up Trump. But that delicate arrangement appeared to fall apart on Thursday, after Giuliani also asked to record the interview to ensure he might not be caught in a perjury trap in a potential subsequent investigation, according to another source close to Giuliani. The no-show by Giuliani could also presage the breakdown of the entire cooperation deal, the source said, and Giuliani is expected to wait for the panel's response to decide next steps. Giuliani may reschedule the interview if the impasse is resolved. 'Giuliani is an important witness to the conspiracy to overthrow the government and he remains under subpoena,' a spokesperson for the select committee said. 'If he refuses to comply, the committee will consider all enforcement options.' House investigators have been particularly determined to get the cooperation from Giuliani, one of Trump's closest advisers involved in efforts to overturn the 2020 election from the very start - and could provide unique insights into the events of January 6. Giuliani could speak to events such as a 18 December 2020 meeting in the Oval Office where Trump reviewed a draft executive order to seize voting machines and verbally agreed to install conspiracy theorist Sidney Powell as special counsel to investigate election fraud.The Guardian has reported that Giuliani then led the Trump 'war room' at the Willard hotel in Washington DC when Trump called from the White House and discussed ways to stop Biden's certification - and could speak to non-privileged elements of the plan.The cooperation deal would also technically involve Giuliani turning over documents in addition to appearing before the select committee, the sources said, but the logistics were unclear given the FBI last year seized his devices that he used on January 6.", "1fcc9c35fc83bd7afb693578a7f01b631072e43e4740164cd7ce72c3": "Researchers say they have found traces of Xinjiang cotton in shirts and T-shirts made by Adidas, Puma and Hugo Boss, appearing to contradict the German clothing companies' promises to revise their supply chains after allegations of widespread forced labour in the Chinese region. Recent reports have suggested more than half a million people from minority ethnic groups such as the Uyghurs have been coerced into picking cotton in Xinjiang, which provides more than 80% of China's and a fifth of the global production of cotton. The US banned cotton imports from the autonomous region in north-west China last year, a move also debated in the European parliament but not enacted by the European Commission. Nonetheless, several large western clothes brands and fashion brands vowed to no longer use Xinjiang cotton in the light of the revelations. Hugo Boss said that as of October 2021 its new collections 'have been verified in line with our global standards again', and that it 'does not tolerate forced labour'. Puma stated in 2020 it had 'no direct or indirect business relationship with any manufacturer in Xinjiang', while Adidas said the same year it had no contractual relationship with any Xinjiang supplier but had instructed its fabric suppliers not to source yarn from the region in the wake of reports about human rights violations. However, researchers at the Agroisolab in Julich and the Hochschule Niederrhein University of Applied Sciences, both in western Germany, say an isotope analysis has found traces of Xinjiang cotton in Puma and Adidas T-shirts, shirts by Hugo Boss and the German outdoor wear brand Jack Wolfskin, and a pullover by the fashion company Tom Tailor. 'The isotopic fingerprints in the cotton are unambiguous and can be differentiated from cotton sourced from other countries and even other Chinese regions,' Markus Boner of Agroisolab told the German public broadcaster NDR's investigative programme STRG_F. Isotope analysis is usually used by archaeologists or forensic scientists to trace the geographic origin of organic or non-organic substances. The five German clothes brands have been contacted by the Guardian for a response to the findings, which STRG_F said it would share with the companies. A spokesperson for Puma told the Guardian that 'we strongly insist on the fact and reconfirm that Puma does not source any cotton from the Xinjiang region. We do reiterate that we do not have any relations - direct or indirect - with any cotton supplier in the Xinjiang region. 'Based on all the information we obtained through our investigations, and the traceability controls we put in place in our supply chain, we are confident that we do not source cotton from the Xinjiang region.' A spokesperson for Adidas said the company 'sources cotton exclusively from other countries and takes a variety of measures to ensure fair and safe working conditions in its supply chain'. Asked by STRG_F's researchers in advance of publication whether they could rule out that Xinjiang cotton was used in their products, Hugo Boss said it did not tolerate forced labour in its supply chains.  Jack Wolfskin did not directly answer a question about the use of Xinjiang cotton in its supply chain but said its cotton was certified. Tom Tailor did not reply to queries from the programme. Speaking anonymously, one auditor investigating Chinese subcontractors told STRG_F it was practically impossible for western companies to thoroughly shed a light on their own supply chains as their access in China was restricted by the communist government of Xi Jinping. 'It is theoretically possible but highly unlikely that western businesses can say with certainty that there is no forced labour in their cotton supply chains in Xinjiang,' the auditor said.", "a38db67506e62a8a3f5ea4d08ac844809d089f74be854185bc66abca": "YouTube is showing videos that promote skin-bleaching, weight loss, drug culture and firearms to children as young as two, a new investigation of the company's 'Kids' app has found. YouTube Kids, an app and website released in 2015, is supposed to be a safer, curated version of the video-sharing website aimed at children under 13. It tailors content to three age groups: 'older', 'younger' and 'preschool', roughly corresponding to those aged nine to 12 years old, four to seven, and under four. The company says it ensures that the videos on the service are family-friendly through 'a mix of automated filters built by our engineering teams, human review and feedback from parents to protect our youngest users online'. But, it cautions users 'no system is perfect and inappropriate videos can slip through'. Research from the Tech Transparency Project, a US-based non-profit, shows that the system is indeed far from perfect. Using three different accounts, each set to one of app's age groups, the analysts discovered numerous videos that should not have made it past Google's filters. A Breaking Bad-themed cooking show, for instance, in which the hosts dress up in respirators and make jokes about the risk of inhaling the fumes, might be light-hearted viewing for adults or teens, but has been categorised by YouTube as being appropriate for 'younger children' - as has a Minecraft project to recreate the RV, 'where the crystal meth is cooked', from the hit show. Songs sometimes slip mature themes into the children's app, too. Eric Clapton's Cocaine - sample lyric 'When your feeling is gone, and you wanna ride on, cocaine' - is available to children as young as five as part of a guitar tuition series. Content aimed at gun users slips through the net, leading to younger children being shown a ranking of recoil pads, which protect shooters from the kickback of a firing gun, and older children being offered step-by-step instructions on how to build a shelf with a hidden compartment to conceal a pistol. Most alarming was content for kids that could lead to harmful body image issues. A popular Indian beauty influencer's post on how to apply skin-bleaching products was available for older kids, while even preschool children were shown a cartoon about the importance of burning calories to lose weight, which exhorted them to 'wiggle your jiggle'. 'YouTube Kids is geared specifically to young children, even toddlers,' said Katie Paul, TTP's director. 'This is a product that, YouTube claims, does a lot of machine learning to filter out harmful content. It's very specifically meant to be safe for children, and we didn't expect to find the variety of inappropriate content that we did find.' 'The most shocking thing, for me personally, was seeing a lot of the drug-related content,' she added. 'Of course, these aren't pushing drugs - but a show like Breaking Bad, which is definitely meant for adults, is being mimicked to push rock candy as though it's 'baked meth' using a lot of drug phrases.' In a statement, a YouTube spokesperson said: 'We built YouTube Kids to create a safer environment for kids to explore their interests and curiosity, while giving parents the tools to customise the experience for their kids. We have a higher bar for which videos can be a part of the app and also empower parents to control what content their child can and cannot see. Upon review we have removed or age-gated a number of the flagged videos from the Kids app.' Paul argued that the results showed 'that algorithmically curated content should not be marketed for kids. This is just another example of the fact that even when a company says they're putting their strongest efforts towards protecting children towards curating this content, we're still seeing harms getting through to some of the most vulnerable populations'. The UK and EU have led the way globally in regulating services like YouTube kids, Paul added, but she said US Congress needed to do its part. She said: 'Ultimately, we are talking about American companies. And it is US Congress that should be leading the way in developing stronger regulations to ensure that these companies are not causing harm to children.'", "5f753632e55d4da5a068bc304c15f037fdc954b27a719a1b1445ea3a": "Swiss police have seized more than 500kg of cocaine from a shipment of coffee beans delivered to a Nespresso plant. Workers at the plant in Romont, in the western Swiss canton of Fribourg, alerted authorities to a mysterious white powder found in sacks of coffee beans, police said. Staff at the coffee capsule maker, owned by Swiss food giant Nestle, 'found an undetermined white substance when they unloaded the freshly delivered sacks of coffee beans', Fribourg police said on Thursday. Police analysis determined the substance was cocaine. A search of five shipping containers 'delivered the same day by train allowed for the seizure of more than 500kg of this drug,' police added. Police said they set up a large security perimeter around the factory during the operation, which also involved a large contingent of customs officers. The units containing the drugs were isolated, and the substance did not contaminate production at the plant, the statement said. The initial investigation indicated the shipment originated in Brazil, police said, adding that the seized cocaine was determined to be more than 80% pure, with an estimated street value of over 50m Swiss francs (PS41m). 'It appears that all of the drugs were destined for the European market,' police said.", "1db9ce15488a7e64c30afa3b6ee98a61d23336d426c186a9953f4574": "Boris Johnson and Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida have warned that the invasion of Ukraine could be replicated in east Asia if democratic powers do not stand up to autocratic ones.  'Ukraine may be east Asia tomorrow,' Kishida said on Thursday during a visit to London, as he called for Indo-Pacific leaders to recognise that the invasion of Ukraine was not just a European problem. Asked about the implications for Taiwan, he said: 'We must collaborate with our allies and like-minded countries, and never tolerate a unilateral attempt to change the status quo by the use of force in the Indo-Pacific, especially in east Asia.' He added: 'Russia's egregious aggression against Ukraine is a clear violation of international law, which prohibits the use of force against a nation's sovereignty and territorial integrity.' Earlier, Johnson said: 'We in the UK recognise that our security in Europe is indivisible from the security, our collective security, in the Asia-Pacific, in the Indo-Pacific region. 'And there is direct read across from the actions of autocratic, coercive powers in Europe, to what may happen in east Asia.' The two countries have signed a mutual access agreement for their two forces, in part dedicated to keep the seas free and open. Kishida also announced new sanctions, including an asset freeze on 140 Russian individuals and the expansion of an export ban to include Russian military firms. The package was announced the day after Russia imposed asset bans and travel freezes on 60 Japanese officials, including Japanese cabinet members and the prime minister himself. Kishida had described the Russian action as completely unacceptable. Kishida's ruling Liberal Democratic party has recently proposed a substantial increase in defence spending - possibly to an amount on a par with 2% of gross domestic product, up from the current 1% - and the development of the capacity to attack missile-launching sites in an enemy's territory. He said that, in the wake of the Russian invasion, he was trying to instil a crisis mentality in the Japanese people. Facing elections in July and rising energy prices that are squeezing voters' budgets, Kishida said nuclear power would form a bigger part of the country's future energy policy mix. He said Japan would address the 'vulnerability of our own energy self-sufficiency' by broadening where it buys energy from, promoting renewables and using nuclear power to diversify its sources of generation. Japan has become more reliant on Russian gas since shutting down nuclear reactors after the 2011 Fukushima disaster, in which an earthquake and tsunami triggered a meltdown, devastating its north-eastern region. The country is reluctant to impose a total ban on Russian oil imports. Kishida's visit to London was the conclusion of a major trip that saw him visit Asean members Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand. Japan is chair of the G7 next year and Kishida is trying to rally east Asia into accepting that Russia's actions, born of authoritarianism, represent a threat to stability, and that, by extension, the region may have to resist China.

The Foreign Office said on Thursday that Evraz 'operates in sectors of strategic significance to the government of Russia' and the action would 'further chip away at Putin's financial reserves and siege economy, and support Ukraine's continued resistance'. Evraz's registered office is in London's Mayfair district, but it has vast mining and steelmaking operations in Russia, with more than 70,000 employees. The UK and allies including the US and EU have used sanctions on Russian companies and businessmen as one of the main tools to respond to the invasion of Ukraine. The Evraz measure is thought to be the first time a former FTSE 100 member has been subject to sanctions. It completes the fall from grace of a company that was valued at more than PS5bn as recently as January. Its membership of the index meant that shares in the company were held by a wide variety of investors managing money for pensions, including BlackRock, Schroders Investment Management, Vanguard and Legal & General. Evraz shares were suspended from trading on the London Stock Exchange in March after the UK government highlighted its alleged strategic significance to Russia when imposing sanctions on Abramovich, who owns a 29% stake in the company. Its board also resigned after the sanctions against Abramovich. The government had in Abramovich's sanctions designation alleged that Evraz was 'potentially supplying steel to the Russian military which may have been used in the production of tanks'. This charge, which was strenuously denied by Evraz, was not included in the company's sanctions designation on Thursday. In a statement in March, Evraz said it did not expect the company itself to be hit with sanctions because Abramovich did not have 'effective control'. It also denied that its steel was used to build Russian tanks, saying it provided steel only to the 'infrastructure and construction sectors'. However, Evraz signed a five-year deal in 2012 to supply railway wheels and 'metal' to UralVagonZavod, a Russian company that is the world's largest manufacturer of battle tanks and which makes T-72s and T-90s, both in service in Ukraine today. A person with knowledge of the contracts said they contained provisions limiting them to civilian use only. An Evraz spokesperson said: 'Evraz in Russia supplies long steel to infrastructure and construction sectors for civilian use only.' In its announcement on Thursday, the Foreign Office said: 'Evraz plc produce 28% of all Russian railway wheels and 97% of rail tracks in Russia. This is of vital significance as Russia uses rail to move key military supplies and troops to the frontline in Ukraine.' It added that the new sanctions would 'further deter companies operating in strategic sectors in Russia'. The sanctions include an asset freeze, meaning no UK citizen or company can do business with the firm. However, UK sanctions guidance suggests that companies subject to sanctions are usually allowed to pay employees and cover other 'basic needs' such as rent, utilities or property management costs.", "f7e9647ec6f84c350707309e5805f832bfd8150c1ce428c56bd500ab": "The Catalan government is calling for answers 'from the highest level' after the head of Spain's National Intelligence Centre (CNI) reportedly confirmed that 18 members of the regional independence movement were spied on with judicial approval. The apparent admission - to a congressional committee - came two weeks after cybersecurity experts said at least 63 people connected with the Catalan independence movement had been targeted or infected with Pegasus spyware, and three days after the Spanish government said the phones of the prime minister and the defence minister had been targeted with Pegasus. Although Paz Esteban's testimony to the official secrets committee was given behind closed doors, political party sources told Spanish media that the director of the CNI had confirmed that 18 of the 63 Catalan activists named in a Citizen Lab report at the end of April had been spied on legally and with the relevant judicial approval. According to reports, one of those targeted was the current Catalan regional president, Pere Aragones - although it is not clear whether he was spied on before or after coming to his current position. It is also unclear whether or not the software alleged to have been used was Pegasus, which according to its manufacturers is sold only to governments to track criminals and terrorists. Gabriel Rufian, a spokesperson for Aragones's pro-independence Catalan Republican Left (ERC) party, who was at the committee hearing, offered guarded details after leaving the session on Thursday. He said what the committee had heard was in line with what had already been leaked, and that the evidence pointed in two directions. 'Basically, that it came from a foreign country, or that it was state agencies acting beyond their legal limits.' In a subsequent tweet, Rufian added: '1) There are no secrets - whether official or unofficial. 2) Nothing was said that the CNI hasn't already leaked. 3) There are only two ways: it was either another country or it was a state agency. And number three is an interpretation. I repeat, an INTERPRETATION.' According to the Citizen Lab report, Aragones and his three pro-independence predecessors were among more than 60 individuals whose phones were targeted or infected with mercenary spyware using fake texts or WhatsApp messages. Almost all the incidents took place between 2017 - the year of the failed attempt at Catalan independence - and 2020. Aragones said the revelations confirmed and aggravated 'the seriousness of the case of massive espionage against Catalan institutions and the independence movement' that Citizen Lab had uncovered. 'We demand the immediate declassification of the judicial authorisation so that we can see what its motivation was, and so that we can defend ourselves,' he said. 'It is urgent that we receive a public explanation of this issue - we need to know who authorised it politically and who knew about it. And that's why we demand an answer from the highest level.' On Wednesday, Aragones - on whose party Spain's Socialist-led coalition government depends for parliamentary support - said the spying scandal was 'dynamiting' attempts to find a negotiated solution to the Catalan independence crisis. The issue has also caused divisions between the Socialist party and its junior partners in the Unidas Podemos alliance, who have called for the resignation of the defence minister, Margarita Robles, whose department oversees the CNI. There have been questions, too, about why the government chose to reveal that Robles' phone, and that of the prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, had been hacked, a year after the apparent targeting took place. The alleged spying has been criticised by Amnesty International. 'The Spanish government can't use the security of the Spanish state as an excuse to cover up possible human rights violation,' said Esteban Beltran, the head of Amnesty Spain. He said the official secrets committee 'is characterised by secrecy and obscurantism [and] cannot be the right place to investigate possible human rights violations'. On Tuesday, Sanchez's Spanish Socialist Workers' party (PSOE) joined the three parties on the Spanish right in vetoing a parliamentary inquiry into the Pegasus scandal. A PSOE spokesperson said the mooted congressional committee was not needed because an internal investigation by the CNI was already under way, as was an inquiry by the public ombudsman.", "aac1eec23976e86882b25e3bf5586ad3aa0d07826514fd5ed1eb89d8": "", "bf0e99e3b208456c9b883ba313dcd23beb22d580652bf7bb3e0d7d83": "", "2af6440d1f1846afc6fc958af71d7e91b179b072195afaf23056d63b": "", "49e47d224d278303f804553656abbecbe078d2e3c5ba5a800be2d506": "", "9b78626352c94244c59eb18a5210c8a62a5c1eceb0352c18bb1bbd6d": "", "bea65e1c33ef5ac677539c1392cedde968de50f3d86b392d3c16023b": "", "f520770c03f7ebe6cdff2f37500b0f3941983946ab37edfc5eeaefef": "", "bccfbe3fd0af37375357dfc57eed9fe687421014195b9f487b3ac980": "", "3187706fc86cf125018e2ef135d765823e98916c836cae724c0be07e": "", "9de98a146f399ccb2ce879fd3b6c08520f696f8de9edcccde03f3f6f": "", "05c9a0f0d261313beda2bf51a1d3e199028415aaaff26889590caa9e": "", "1a0956a2f0e0cf8d0844d14b9ff8dc4dd779a3d14d818062a728b8dc": "", "5ed87b62ec4aa2032d728af76abd602ceb223b5c8fdf7eea488c67d9": "Chief Justice John Roberts has condemned the leak of a draft supreme court opinion overturning Roe v Wade as a 'betrayal'. But for the majority of Americans who support the right to abortion access, the true betrayal was committed by the five justices who have initially voted to overturn the landmark case. That is especially true of the three conservative supreme court justices who were nominated by Donald Trump: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. During their Senate confirmation hearings, each of those three justices was asked about Roe and Planned Parenthood v Casey, the 1992 case that upheld the right to abortion access and could now be overturned as well. The comments that the three justices made during those hearings are now coming under renewed scrutiny, as they face accusations of having misled politicians and the public about their willingness to overturn Roe. Republican Senator Susan Collins, who supported Gorsuch and Kavanaugh and repeatedly reassured the public that they would not vote to overturn Roe, has expressed alarm over the draft opinion and a sense that the justices told her something they later reversed. 'If this leaked draft opinion is the final decision and this reporting is accurate, it would be completely inconsistent with what Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh said in their hearings and in our meetings in my office,' Collins said, while noting that the draft opinion is not final. Republican Senator Lisa Murkowksi, who also supports abortion rights and voted in favor of Gorsuch's and Barrett's nominations, said the draft opinion 'rocks my confidence in the court right now'. Murkowski told reporters on Tuesday: 'If the decision is going the way that the draft that has been revealed is actually the case, it was not the direction that I believed that the court would take based on statements that have been made about Roe being settled and being precedent.' During his 2017 confirmation hearings, Gorsuch said: 'Casey is settled law in the sense that it is a decision of the US supreme court.' When Kavanaugh appeared before the Senate judiciary committee in 2018, he similarly described Roe as 'important precedent of the supreme court that has been reaffirmed many times', and he defined Casey as 'precedent on precedent' because it upheld Roe. But legal excerpts say Gorsuch and Kavanaugh's comments about Roe and Casey did not clearly indicate how they might vote in a case like Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization, raising the prospect that some people may have read into their statements only what they wished to hear. 'When people are nominated to the supreme court and they testify in Senate confirmation hearings, they are very careful about their language,' said Professor Katherine Franke of Columbia law school. 'Something like 'settled law' actually has no concrete legal meaning. What it means is that that's a decision from the supreme court, and I acknowledge that it exists. But it doesn't carry any kind of significance beyond that.' During her Senate confirmation hearings, Barrett was arguably even more careful than Gorsuch and Kavanaugh in her language about Roe. She refused to identify Roe as a 'superprecedent', meaning a widely accepted case that is unlikely to be overturned by the court. Instead she promised that, if confirmed, she would abide by 'stare decisis', the legal principle of deciding cases based on precedent. However, Barrett's writings before joining the supreme court gave a clear indication of her thoughts on Roe. In one 1998 paper, Barrett and her co-author defined abortion as 'always immoral' in the view of the Catholic church. She also signed off on a 2006 advertisement that described Roe as 'barbaric'. 'I'm sure that both Senators Collins and Murkowski asked pointed questions of all of these nominees, trying to get them to clearly say that they would not overrule Roe v Wade,' Franke said. 'Murkowski and Collins maybe heard what they wanted to hear in order to feel better about voting to confirm these nominees, when the rest of the world knew quite clearly that they were ideologically and legally opposed to abortion.' For that reason, many progressives expressed little sympathy for Collins and Murkowski as they reacted with bafflement to the draft opinion. 'Murkowski voted for Amy Coney Barrett when Trump himself proclaimed that he was appointing justices specifically to overturn Roe,' progressive congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Tuesday. 'She and Collins betrayed the nation's reproductive rights when they were singularly capable of stopping the slide. They don't get to play victim now.' Progressives are demanding that Collins and Murkowski, rather than showing remorse, take action to protect abortion rights. Both Collins and Murkowski have said they support codifying Roe into law, but that proposal does not have the 60 votes necessary to overcome a Senate filibuster. Progressives are now calling on Collins and Murkowski to support a filibuster carveout to enshrine the protections of Roe into law. 'To salvage their legacy, Collins and Murkowski must join with Democratic senators to do whatever is necessary to protect Roe in federal law,' said Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. 'No meaningful action will happen without a filibuster carveout now.' But Collins and Murkowski have so far given no indication that they would support such a carveout. Unless they do, the court stands ready to overturn nearly 50 years of precedent and erase the national right to abortion access, even though a clear majority of the country would oppose that decision. A CNN poll released earlier this year found that 69% of Americans are against overturning Roe, while just 30% support a reversal. If the court follows through with the draft decision, 26 states are certain or likely to ban abortion. Those bans could force people to travel far from home to reach states where abortion is legal, seek medication illicitly or attempt to terminate a pregnancy through dangerous means. Many pregnant people will also be forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term. And Collins and Murkowski may have nothing to offer Americans but regret.

Anez stands accused of assuming the presidency by unconstitutional means, and could face up to 15 years in prison. But the trial is unfolding amid accusations that the governing Movimiento al Socialismo (Mas) is pursuing its opponents through the justice system. The current case examines three tumultuous days between the resignation of President Evo Morales on 10 November 2019 and the swearing-in of Anez. Three weeks earlier, Morales had won a fourth consecutive term, despite a previous pledge to leave at the end of his third term as stipulated by Bolivia's 2009 constitution. Disputed allegations of electoral fraud then sparked nationwide protests. Eventually the police mutinied, and the military suggested Morales leave power. Bolivia was without a president for two days, until Anez, a little-known senator from a minor rightwing party, assumed the position. She promised new elections, which eventually took place in October 2020. The Mas, led by Luis Arce, the former finance minister, came back to power in a landslide. Anez was arrested in March last year and has been in pre-trial detention since. The current trial focuses on how Anez vaulted from second vice-president of the senate to president, a path which opened up when the vice-president and the leaders of the two chambers followed Morales in resigning. Separately, the government intends to try Anez over two massacres committed by security forces during her presidency, in Senkata and Sacaba. The prosecution claims that Anez's succession was unconstitutional - and that she had support from the security forces. Numerous generals are on trial with her. Anez's defence claims that there was a power vacuum and the presidency fell to her. 'I was the product or the consequence of this situation,' she said in her oral testimony. 'That was my crime: bringing peace to the country, assuming power by constitutional succession.' The prosecution has said it expects sentences to be passed shortly, but few expect the verdict to bring an end to Bolivia's stark political polarisation. Mas and its supporters believe there was a coup, while the opposition argue Anez was fulfilling her duty - and that this trial is both illegitimate and political, designed to cover up electoral fraud in the 2019 election. The situation has been exacerbated by the apparent lack of due process. In Bolivia, former presidents should in theory face a 'trial of responsibilities', authorised by a two-thirds majority in the legislative assembly. But the prosecution opted to try Anez as a citizen, since the trial concerns events before she became president. Other doubts over the trial include Anez's extensive pre-trial detention, the lack of care she has received for medical problems, and the fact that the case has been heard virtually, rather than in-person - even though in-person trials resumed in Bolivia months ago. The process has taken a toll on Anez, who appeared to have an anxiety attack and faint during the first days of the trial. Anez's daughter and her lawyers have given tearful press conferences to argue that her treatment is inhumane, even sharing her blood pressure readings. These doubts are contested, but they have nonetheless undermined the trial in the eyes of many. 'The government is under a magnifying glass, and they should be doing this perfectly,' said Thomas Becker, a lawyer working with the victims of the Senkata and Sacaba massacres. 'And I think there have been procedural problems.' More broadly, some see the case against Anez as part of a pattern of political persecution. Numerous members of her administration, and some supporters from civil society, have either been arrested or fled the country. But this is not unique to the current government, notes Maria Teresa Zegada, a Bolivian sociologist. Anez's government persecuted members of Morales's government; Morales's government pursued its opponents, too. 'It's a vicious cycle of score-settling,' said Zegada. This reflects the pliability of Bolivia's justice system to those in power - something widely recognised in the country, as well as by Human Rights Watch and the UN special rapporteur who visited the country this year - and only makes it less likely the opposition, and society as a whole, will accept the trial's outcome as impartial. 'Bolivia remains a polarised country, and there's not a lot of trust across the political divide,' said Carwil Bjork-James, an anthropologist. 'Then there is a recurrent problem, which is a lack of trust in the independence of the judicial apparatus. And that makes any trial challenging right now.'", "c6807788af701e99c3e2b3797624d9259c8fe62ca2de5e8892cd027c": "On the evening of 17 February 2021, Gabriel Bringye kissed his fiancee goodbye, and assured her he wouldn't work late. Hours later, police were at the door of their east London home. He had been killed on the job, lured by a group of teenagers who booked his car on the Bolt cab ride app in order to rob him. Known as a 'trap job', the group used a stolen phone to book the journey that ended with the 37-year-old driver's death. Despite his vehicle remaining stationary for nearly six hours while booked on a job, Bolt had no automated system in place to raise the alarm; Gabriel was found by a passerby. He died at the scene. More than a year since his death, Gabriel's sister Renata Bringye and his fiancee, Mara Fazecas, are leading the fight to promote driver safety and prevent more attacks on drivers. In a campaign with the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB), Renata, who also works as a private hire driver, and Fazecas, a hotel cleaning supervisor, are demanding Bolt implements better safety measures. They also want the multibillion dollar company to give its drivers worker status, as Uber was forced to do last year. Renata, 35, remembers her older brother as a family man: 'He never had a problem with anyone. If anybody needed something, he was the first who jumped to help.' The Romanian national, who had been working as a driver for five years at the time of his death, lived with his fiancee, his sister and her nine-year-old son in Walthamstow, after moving to London from Spain more than a decade ago. After working in construction, Gabriel became a private-hire driver, attracted by the flexibility it offered. He enjoyed driving, and choosing his own hours meant he could help his sister take care of her son. Her brother's death left Renata shaken, and she deleted the Bolt app from her phone. 'I don't want it to happen to me as well, because I have my little son to bring up,' she says. Gabriel's killers, aged 18 and 19, were found guilty of manslaughter at the Old Bailey in mid-March, with the prosecution arguing the killing had been a consequence of a plan to rob a driver. Since Gabriel's death, other Bolt drivers have been brutally attacked and robbed. Just weeks after the incident, Muhammad Alam was punched in the face and had his car stolen at knifepoint in east London; Garad Hussein was left unable to walk and needing multiple operations after an attack in Birmingham last December. Bolt introduced welfare checks on static vehicles after Gabriel's killing, a change that IWGB president Alex Marshall credits to the pressure of their campaigning: if a car remains stationary for an unexplained reason, the company's safety team will contact the driver and passenger, and then the police if neither responds. But Gabriel and Fazecas are pushing for more comprehensive protections. Alongside customer photo requirements, vehicle partitions and CCTV in the vehicle, they are calling for the app to introduce password protection. To 37-year-old Fazecas, this is critical, as Gabriel was ambushed by a group who booked the trip on a stolen phone. 'If they had a login password, so they couldn't make a trap trip, Gabriel would still be alive today.' The campaign has been pushing for Bolt to implement better protection measures for drivers by writing letters that outline their demands, protesting outside the company headquarters and holding a vigil and rally on the anniversary of Gabriel's death. It was at this last event that the campaign was officially launched, with Nader Awaad, chair of the IWGB's United Private Hire Drivers branch saying: 'Every driver deserves to feel safe in their place of work, but a year since Gabriel's tragic [killing] the threat of abuse, harassment and violence is still a daily part of the job.' While the campaign's demands are primarily directed at Bolt, Marshall says he is 'hoping for a domino effect' for workers throughout the gig economy. Worker status is integral to driver safety, he argues: the precarity of the gig economy often pushes drivers into taking on jobs they may feel uneasy about due to reasons such as a customer having a low rating or feeling unsafe working at night. Employment rights allow drivers to 'make basic risk assessments', he says: 'When you're constantly being underpaid, you're constantly working to try and hit targets ... It might get to a point where you think, 'I don't really like the look of this job, I haven't made enough today, so I probably should take this job just to make a few more quid.'' Bolt says that it has increased the rates it charges to passengers and, as such, Bolt drivers are now making 22% more per mile than they were making in January 2020. Renata was all too familiar with making difficult decisions about which jobs to take, particularly as a female driver - and she says Bolt penalised her for turning down jobs. She claims she was repeatedly suspended from the app after her acceptance rate slipped below the company's minimum threshold, due to rejecting passengers with low ratings - a story similar to that of Andrei Donisa, who brought a case in 2020 over the issue. Bolt says it has since scrapped its acceptance rate policy. Renata points out another imbalance: while drivers must maintain a minimum rating of 4.0 to work for the app, there appears to be no equivalent requirement for passengers. As well as an absence of partition barriers, there are other factors that may place gig economy drivers at higher risk of attacks than black cab drivers, Marshall argues. In London, about 90% of black cab drivers are white British while 94% of private hire drivers are BAME, and he says racism can play a role in sparking assaults against some immigrant drivers: 'If English isn't your first language, that's a point of contention for some passengers.' He also believes the perception of how minicab drivers are treated by the firms they work for affects their treatment by the public. 'Companies hire and fire them at the click of a button, they have zero responsibility if a violent incident happens - people just think: 'I can treat these guys as I want, because what's going to happen?'' He compares this to how black cab drivers are often perceived: 'They're part of London's fibre, they're a tourist attraction, they're on postcards.' After Gabriel's death, his family received a bouquet of flowers from Bolt and a voicemail message from a company representative; they are upset that the company subsequently claimed in press statements to have been supporting them.  Gareth Taylor, regional manager for the UK and Ireland at Bolt, said: 'Bolt condemns violence of any form directed towards private-hire drivers, who we believe have the right to earn a living without risk of harm, intimidation, coercion, or fear of death or injury. The death of Gabriel Bringye was a shocking and senseless tragedy. Our subsequent response and communication with his family was not conducted to the standard that is expected and we are truly sorry.' Taylor said he intended to meet with Gabriel's family within the next few weeks to convey his condolences and discuss their campaign's demands. In addition to checks on static vehicles, Taylor said Bolt has also set up a round-the-clock support line and 'significantly' increased its safety team, who handle safety related incidents, including conducting welfare checks. Taylor said the safety team is also working to ban passengers with consistently poor feedback, and is implementing a system preventing drivers and passengers who have previously rated each other poorly from being reconnected. 'We are dedicated to making our platform as safe as possible for drivers and passengers and we have a range of safety improvements planned over the coming year,' he said. In a gesture of solidarity with the family, several drivers accompanied the family to Kent when they took Gabriel's body home to Romania last year via the Channel. But Fazecas has been unable to feel settled anywhere since her partner's death. 'I always felt at home with him. I realised after he died, home is not a place - it's a feeling you have with the person you love. 'Gabriel was young, he was full of dreams. We wanted to start a family. I want to do this [campaign] in memory of Gabriel - I don't want his life to go away and nothing to change.'", "cba417a49e6fa084239b1de463c6b7d212f714348f5b4f197fbb6622": "The roaring success of Covid vaccines - in countries able to obtain them - has led to deaths and severe disease from the infection plummeting even as the virus evolved to sidestep immunity and rip through populations more swiftly. But while the rapid development of Covid shots ranks as the finest achievement of the pandemic, scientists are not done yet. In a small number of labs around the world, teams are taking on a problem that cannot be ignored: that the virus remains rampant in the face of mass immunity. The problem has arisen because existing Covid vaccines are better at preparing the immune system to fight the virus inside the body than stopping it at the gates. So even though immunity has largely 'defanged' Covid, countries still face waves of infection that hospitalise vulnerable people, keep staff off work, and leave an uncertain proportion of people with long Covid. Hopes to halt the spread of infection are riding on the development of vaccines that are delivered by a spray up the nose rather than a shot in the arm. They aim to produce strong immune protection in the nose and throat, where most Covid infections gain a foothold. Beyond their potential to block infections, intranasal sprays may be more acceptable to people who are not keen on needles. 'If you think of your body as a castle, an intramuscular vaccination is really protecting the inner areas of your castle so once invaders come in, that immunity protects against them taking the throne,' said Dr Sean Liu, medical director of the Covid clinical trials unit at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. 'But if you train your immune system to work at the gates of the castle, then the invaders not only have trouble getting in, but they may have trouble spreading inside.' Liu is running an early-stage trial on an intranasal Covid vaccine made in a similar way to seasonal flu vaccines, meaning it could be churned out by the same facilities and dramatically improve global access to Covid vaccines. More than a dozen clinical trials of intranasal Covid vaccines are under way, but the process is not without its challenges. For an intranasal vaccine to work, it should produce a robust and lasting immune response in the nasal mucosa, the moist membrane that lines the inside of the nose. It helps, too, if people do not swallow or sneeze it out, which can make reliable dosing difficult. The widely used Pfizer and Moderna vaccines do not immediately lend themselves to intranasal delivery. Both vaccines use tiny, fatty nanoparticles to smuggle the genetic instructions (RNA) for the coronavirus spike protein into cells which prime the immune system. 'In theory, RNA vaccines could work, but nobody has worked out how to deliver them as an effective intranasal spray,' said Prof Robin Shattock, head of mucosal infection and immunity at Imperial College London. 'The lipid nanoparticles are quite delicate and work beautifully when you inject them into the body, but it's more of an engineering problem to work out how to deliver them into the nose, get them across the mucus, and into the cells.' So far, only one intranasal vaccine has found a wide market, namely AstraZeneca's influenza spray, marketed as Flumist in the US and - mindful of potential misunderstandings in Germany - Fluenz in Europe. The vaccine uses a weakened influenza virus, which can get into the cells of the nasal lining and provoke an immune reaction. It not only protects the individual against flu, but helps to reduce community infections, a feat scientists want to repeat with Covid. An early-stage trial of an intranasal version of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is expected to publish results soon. The Oxford vaccine is based on a weakened adenovirus, which may be able to induce an immune response in the nose. But all researchers face hurdles with intranasal vaccines, including measuring the strength of the immune response, knowing how protective it will be, and how long it might last. If an intranasal vaccine provides strong protection against infection, but only for a few months, it may work best as an autumn booster, topping up Covid jabs that provide more enduring 'systemic' protection against severe disease. 'I think you'd want the systemic vaccine as well because it's so important for protecting against severe disease,' said Prof Peter Openshaw, a member of the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag). 'I wouldn't want to just rely on a purely mucosal immunisation unless it can also generate a decent systemic response.' Dr Sandy Douglas, a pharmaceutical physician who works on the Oxford vaccine, does not expect any intranasal Covid vaccines to be available this year. 'Nobody should put off having their intramuscular vaccine to wait for a nasal spray,' he said. 'But as a midterm prospect, this is one of the most important questions in vaccinology, not just for Covid, but for the next pandemic,' he added. 'How do we make vaccines that are good at completely stopping infection with respiratory viruses? We need to solve that problem as soon as we possibly can. It may be that it takes a significant amount of effort and investment, but I'd say it's absolutely worth it. We can see how big the advantage would be if we had vaccines that completely stopped infection.'", "24604af6a4547c705b9a21e62c726dccee3b2383ecdd1343c8faf7c1": "At 5am, it's as dark as it ever gets in Times Square, where massive digital billboards never stop blasting light into the sky, illuminating city blocks across midtown. The square is among the most-visited tourist attractions in New York City, but at this time it's deserted, save for five people standing outside the Winter Garden Theatre. This is where the Guardian finds Robert Samuel, a 46-year-old former mobile phone salesman, whose job is now to sit in lines for other, mostly wealthy, people. It's a strange career, but one which has given Samuel a front row seat at some of the biggest cultural events of the last decade - and a job which perhaps sums up the state of capitalism, and inequality, in 2022. The job entails Samuel sitting, or standing, or sometimes sleeping, in lines: waiting for theater tickets, iPhone releases, and once for someone to die as part of a macabre French art exhibit. Depending on the gig, Samuel then relinquishes his place to his customer or buys them tickets for in-demand shows. On this cold Thursday in April, despite the time, Samuel is chirpy and energetic. Wearing a hoodie and a baseball cap, he unpacks a tiny tent and a camp chair, and settles in for what will be an hours-long wait to buy two tickets for The Music Man. The show is the hottest ticket in town, largely because Hugh Jackman is playing the lead role of Professor Harold Hill, and to get a seat fans have to get down here early. Or they pay Samuel, who has been doing this full-time for nine years. The weather is 46F (8C) but it's nothing compared with what Samuel refers to, with a mix of dread and reverence, as 'the Hamilton line'. 'It was zero degrees one day,' Samuel says. 'And the inside of my tent was frozen with frost. I was able to scratch and write lines. That was, I think, the coldest I've ever waited.' It was worth it though, because Hamilton, the wildly popular Lin-Manuel Miranda musical that has broken records since it opened in February 2015, is really what made Samuel's line-sitting career. 'I feel like I need to cut him a commission check,' he says. He remembers those days with fondness. Hamilton swiftly became a golden goose for Samuel, but when Miranda announced his departure from the show, it reached another level entirely. Samuel had to hire people, initially friends and acquaintances, to sit in line with him, as theatergoers scrambled to catch Manuel's final performances. 'You have those theater purists who have to see the original cast, no matter the cost,' Samuel says. Resale tickets were available online, but for $15,000 or more. Samuel's method meant his clients were receiving rush tickets, often in prime seats, released on the morning of the show. The tickets came at a knockdown price, but Samuel's labor did not. 'The wait was four, maybe five, days. We were charging $5,000 to get you two tickets. But compared to buying one resale ticket, we were the best deal in town.' At the beginning of Hamilton's run, Samuel would buy two tickets, the maximum allowed, and hand them over to clients. The theater soon changed its policy, however, requiring the buyer of the tickets to see the show themselves. 'I'd politely tell them: 'Hi, you're going to have a date,'' Samuel says. It didn't seem to bother Samuel's customers, who would commission him or his team to buy two tickets and invite them along to see the show. 'One of the benefits of line-sitting, for me, has been rediscovering my love of theater,' Samuel says. He grew up in Brooklyn, across the East River, and a trip to Broadway, in Manhattan, was a rare treat when he was a child; his first show was Evita, which he saw with his mother - but he has seen Hamilton 10 times and seldom misses the most talked about plays and musicals. Hamilton raked in tens of thousands of dollars for Samuel, who eventually formed his own company called Same Ole Line Dudes. That wouldn't be the only pop culture wave in which he played a role. Through his job Samuel has been present at some of the defining retail and cultural moments of the millennium. As the iPhone became the hottest consumer item on the planet, Samuel was there, waiting in line outside the company's flagship New York store. As the street fashion brand Supreme built a cult following through its limited-edition drops, Samuel was at its SoHo store buying newly released T-shirts and hoodies. (His Supreme gigs prompted Samuel's one attempt to buy sought-after products and resell them online. 'I lost money,' he says, shaking his head. 'And I'm like: 'This isn't for me, let me just stick to my lane.'')  The cronut? Samuel was a regular presence outside the Dominique Ansel bakery that created the portmanteau delicacy before that day's batch sold out. Saturday Night Live? Samuel's worked that too. When Omega, the luxury watch brand, soared in popularity and began to dabble in the world of limited edition releases, Samuel was there to scoop them up for clients with thousands of dollars to spend, but without the time, or inclination, to do the dirty work. But the jobs aren't always about making people happy. And the work, especially in recent times, has posed some moral dilemmas. Samuel was paid by two different news organizations to hold a spot in line for the weeks-long Ghislaine Maxwell trial, which culminated in Jeffrey Epstein's longtime associate being convicted of sex trafficking in December 2021. And when the Covid-19 pandemic hit, Samuel waited in line for vaccines, enabling New York-based clients - who frequently did not live in the area where the shots were being administered - to swoop in and get their vaccinations. Pre-pandemic, the job was enough for Samuel to earn up to $80,000 a year. But the job has exposed some of the uglier sides of society. Samuel says the worst part of the job is the racism that he and his team, many of whom are Black and Latino, have experienced. Samuel recalled how one of his colleagues had fallen into conversation with a woman and her young daughter as they all waited for Hamilton tickets. The daughter asked Samuel's line-sitter about the last show he had seen. 'Oh, don't be silly, they don't go to see shows,' the mother interjected. Another time, a colleague was waiting for tickets for Macbeth. He got talking with a white man in line and told him about line-sitting. ''He was like: 'Great idea, that's awesome. But are there any white people who do this?'' Samuel recalls. That was before Donald Trump was elected. After that, Samuel said, 'it just exacerbated it to a whole other level'. 'A lot of tourists come from red states. And they bring those attitudes with them. And it's like: 'OK. This is a blue state. This is a blue city. You need to just shut up.'' Still, Samuel is happy with his job and - pre-pandemic - made a good living. But in a country where wealth inequality has exceeded the extremes of the 1920s and the gig economy has created precarious working conditions for many, Samuel's role is another example of the wealthy exerting their financial power. To Sarah Damaske, a professor of sociology and labor and employment relations at Penn State University, the dynamic is reminiscent of 'very old forms of labor'. 'When we see really extreme income inequality, this ability to outsource personal tasks becomes more possible. It becomes more possible for someone who's at one end of the extreme to purchase the labor power of someone who is at the other end of the extreme when the minimum wage is stagnant for as long as it has been,' Damaske said. 'Which is why it makes me think of those days gone by when people were afforded opportunities via birthright, in kind of a manor-born type of way.' Most of Samuel's work is based in New York City, but his role has enabled him to travel. In July 2018 he was hired by the artists David Brognon and Stephanie Rollin for their show Until Then. An exploration of attitudes to euthanasia, the exhibition involved Samuel, whom the artists found online, sitting, alone, in an 11th-century church in France.  Samuel sat in the church, waiting, for 26 days, the period of time between an unnamed patient in Belgium having informed their doctors that they wanted to die, and actually dying. At the moment the patient died, Samuel stood up and walked out of the church. 'My eyes swelled up, and when I walked out of that church, even though I didn't know that person, to know that I was waiting for them to end their life, it just touched me in such a way that I had never expected,' he says. The experience still moves Samuel - 'I still get a little emotional thinking about it now,' he says, his eyes watering slightly. As for his regular work, waiting for tickets, gadgets and clothes, Samuel simply sees it as part of a 'convenience that has taken over society'. 'You can get people to literally do everything for you,' he says. 'They can watch your kids, they can watch your pets. They can clean your home, you know, they can pick you up from A to B, bring you your food. So this is just an extension of that. 'You can get people to do just about anything, within reason, as long as it's legal and you want to pay.'", "2554a12fa2cb85ff8dd5e52934a356106ab179535dcf81e183ba994a": "", "7728e596f6b684362198f543d93790bafad3ba2d6d40ce9197bb187b": "", "586b6b51f377277fefae0684eae8aae0a5ea95cd0cd93ee7293e2fbc": "The United Nations says a new safe passage operation is underway in and around the bombarded southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, The Associated Press and Reuters are reporting.

And humanitarian spokesman Saviano Abreu tells AP the UN is working in coordination with the parties to the conflict and the International Committee of the Red Cross. He says they will 'share more information when the situation allows.' It is not clear how many people are part of the evacuation and Abreu would not say whether people at the Azovstal steel plant are involved.

Thank you for following our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This blog has now closed. You can find our latest coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war in our new live blog in the link below. It is 8am in Ukraine. Here is a comprehensive run-down of everything you might have missed: British prime minister Boris Johnson has lauded Ukraine's president Zelenskiy as 'truly one of the most incredible leaders of modern times' during a fundraising event in London.  Johnson said the UK will 'continue to intensify' efforts to assist Ukraine for as long as the help is needed and insisted Russian president Vladimir Putin will 'never break' the spirit of the Ukrainian people, Downing Street said. No 10 said the aim of the event, titled 'Brave Ukraine', was to raise vital funds for the humanitarian response to the conflict, according to a report from PA Media. The PM said it was 'a blessing for Ukraine and for the world' and 'a disaster for Putin' that Zelenskiy was leading in Kyiv, describing the Ukrainian president as 'truly one of the most incredible leaders of modern times'. 'No matter what Putin tries to do to Ukraine's people ... he will never break their spirit ... He will never overcome those indomitable armed forces, who have already repelled the Russian army from the gates of Kyiv, and therefore achieved the greatest feat of arms of the 21st century,' he said. 'I want you to know, and I told Volodymyr this earlier on today in our conversation, we will continue to intensify this effort for as long as Ukraine wants and needs our help,' he added. Poland and the Baltic states have inaugurated a new gas pipeline that links the north-eastern EU with the rest of the bloc, a crucial step towards reducing dependence on Russian gas, AFP reports. The 508 km-long (316-mile) pipeline linking Poland and Lithuania's gas networks will eventually be able to transport around two billion cubic meters of gas per year in either direction. Thanks to existing links in the region, Latvia, Estonia and even Finland will also have access to the wider European gas pipeline network. 'Today, we are inaugurating our energy independence,' Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda told a ceremony outside the capital Vilnius. 'This interconnector is a response to blackmail' from Russia, said his Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda. Poland has said it is ready to completely swear off Russian gas if necessary and the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia announced at the end of last month they were halting imports of Russian gas and would use their reserves. All the nations are heavily dependent upon Russian gas imports. The EU funded a large part of the 500-million-euro ($530 million) cost of the construction of the GIPL pipeline. Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmygal told a news conference on Thursday that preliminary economic losses from the war are estimated to be about $600 billion, adding that most of the losses should be covered with 'money from the aggressor'. Ukraine also needed between $4 to $5bn a month just to cover the budget deficit, he said, adding that Ukraine's important grain exports have been hit after six of its largest storage facilities were struck by missiles. 'Russia is provoking a food security crisis. Now millions of tonnes of our grain are blocked in our ports,' he said, urging the international community to pressure Russia 'to organise corridors to transport grain to countries which badly need it'. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy earlier launched a global crowdfunding platform to help Ukraine win the war against Russia and rebuild the country's infrastructure. 'In one click, you can donate funds to protect our defenders, to save our civilians and to rebuild Ukraine,' Zelenskiy said in announcing the launch of the United24 platform. 'All funds will be transferred to the national bank of Ukraine and allocated to the relevant ministries,' Zelenskiy added. The Ukrainian president outlined the three areas of support the funding would go towards: defence and de-mining, humanitarian and medical aid and the restoration of critical infrastructure. Here are some of the latest images to come out of Ukraine today, detailing the ongoing destruction. European Union countries are 'almost there' in agreeing the bloc's proposed new package of sanctions against Russia, including an oil embargo, the bloc's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Thursday. A $300 million yacht belonging to Russian oligarch Suleiman Kerimov has been seized by Fijian authorities at the request of the United States Department of Justice.  'Fijian law enforcement executed a seizure warrant freezing the Motor Yacht Amadea (the Amadea), a 348-foot luxury vessel owned by sanctioned Russian oligarch Suleiman Kerimov,' a news release from the Department of Justice said. The Fijian authorities acting with the FBI were following a seizure warrant issued by Washington 'which found that the Amadea is subject to forfeiture based on probable cause of violations of US law, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), money laundering and conspiracy,' according to the statement.  The seizure was orchestrated through the Justice Department's Task Force KleptoCapture, an interagency law enforcement task force run out of the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, focused on enforcing the 'the sweeping sanctions, export controls, and economic countermeasures that the United States, along with its foreign allies and partners, has imposed in response to Russia's unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine' the news release added. Kerimov has been sanctioned by the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control who designated him as 'part of a group of Russian oligarchs who profit from the Russian government through corruption and its malign activity around the globe, including the occupation of Crimea,' the Department of Justice added.  A court in Spain has ordered the provisional release of Anatoly Shariy, a Ukrainian politician and blogger who was arrested after being accused of treason in Ukraine. Shariy was arrested on Wednesday near the coastal city of Tarragona under an international arrest warrant issued by Ukraine, according to Spain's National Court and as reported by the Associated Press. Court documents as seen by the news agency reportedly said Shariy is accused of 'high treason and incitement of hatred.' Citing the 'circumstances of the case' and Shariy's connections to Spain, the judge declined to keep him in custody. Instead Shariy was ordered to surrender his passport, report regularly to authorities and remain in Spain, where he has reportedly lived since 2019. The court said the measures would remain in place for 40 days in order to allow Ukraine to formally request Shariy's extradition. His arrest in Spain was announced by Ukraine's security services on Thursday, who said there was reason to believe Shariy 'was acting on behalf of foreign entities.' Shariy, the founder of a political party considered by many in Ukraine to be pro-Russian, has been a vocal critic of Ukraine's government. As recently as Tuesday he tweeted that he had been warned that Ukrainian intelligence was trying to track him down.", "c3fdd2a4bc3f860a9c5b43a97c166d03f5a442791f640728619cbe8e": "US officials have reportedly confirmed they are providing intelligence that has helped Ukrainian forces target and kill many of the Russian generals who have died in the Ukraine war. The claim in the New York Times, quoting unnamed defence officials, appears to confirm suspicions the US is supplying actionable intelligence in real time to help the Ukrainian military select high-value targets. Appearing to confirm the claims, the Pentagon spokesperson, John Kirby, acknowledged the US was providing 'Ukraine with information and intelligence that they can use to defend themselves', although Adrienne Watson, a national security council spokesperson, said intelligence was not provided 'with the intent to kill Russian generals'. The acknowledgment of US intelligence assistance in targeting Russian forces, which comes on top of another $20bn (PS16bn) in promised weapons to Ukraine from Washington, is a further escalation in what is increasingly becoming a proxy war between the US, with its western allies, and Russian forces in Ukraine. Some European officials expressed uneasiness about the claims. 'We have to be very careful on what we are briefing, for two reasons: for the security of the operations on the ground ... and because we don't want to go to war with Russia,' one said. Another, well briefed on the issue, said the claim was misleading. 'I don't think that the information published in the New York Times on the targeting of Russian generals is accurate,' the official said. 'The reason why Ukrainian forces have succeeded in targeting Russian generals is simply because the Russians implement former Soviet Union doctrines. The Ukrainians are smart enough to know which area they need to target once the Russian troops are deployed on the ground.' It has also been suggested that a top-down decision-making tradition in the Russian military, combined with a failure of the army's secure communications systems, has meant that generals have had to come to the frontline to give their orders directly, putting them in the line of fire. The Kremlin said on Thursday it was well aware that the US, Britain and other Nato countries were constantly feeding intelligence to the Ukrainian military and that this would not stop Russia from achieving its objectives. While Moscow has already said it was targeting western arms shipments arriving in Ukraine, it also threatened 'lightning fast' retaliation after the UK defence minister James Heappey defended Ukraine striking targets inside Russia. According to the US officials, Washington has given Ukraine details on Russia's expected troop movements and the location and other information about Russia's mobile military headquarters, and Ukraine has combined that help with its own intelligence to conduct artillery strikes and other attacks that have killed Russian officers. Ukrainian officials said they had killed about 12 Russian generals on the battlefield. The most recent fatality apparently occurred at the weekend with the reported death of Maj Gen Andrei Simonov, a Russian electronic warfare commander, who Ukraine said it killed near the city of Izyum in the Kharkiv region, which is occupied by Russian forces. Justifying the sharp increase in military assistance to Ukraine last month, the US president, Joe Biden, made it clear Washington wanted to help shape conditions to assist Ukrainian forces in the current phase of the war, as Moscow has pivoted from its failed attempt to take Kyiv to focus on eastern and southern regions of the country. The New York Times reported the Biden administration had sought to keep much intelligence secret to avoid provoking Vladimir Putin into a wider war. That cautious calculation appears to have changed in recent weeks, as countries have voiced overt support for Ukraine and supplied far more lethal equipment, including much-needed artillery and ammunition. Summing up that mood last month, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said the US wanted 'to see Russia weakened to the degree it cannot do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine'. Boris Johnson, in an address to the Ukrainian parliament earlier this week, framed the fight in Churchillian terms.", "1b037790d1dc355851e92cc12b1fa8c2c785b3c59bdba060c5fed5c2": "Fierce fighting has continued inside Mariupol's Azovstal steelworks, the commander of Ukrainian forces in the plant said, as more civilians fled the city on evacuation buses following weeks of brutal bombardment that have reduced much of it to rubble. Ukrainian forces were fighting 'difficult, bloody battles' against Russian troops for a second day, Denys Prokopenko, commander of the Azov regiment, said in a brief video released on Telegram late on Wednesday. 'I am proud of my soldiers who are making superhuman efforts to contain the pressure of the enemy ... the situation is extremely difficult,' Prokopenko said. Earlier on Wednesday, David Arakhamia, the head of Ukraine's ruling party in parliament, told RFE/RL that Russian forces had entered the plant, but he said that the country's government remained in contact with the Ukrainian troops staging a last stand. Ukraine claimed on Thursday that it had regained control over several settlements surrounding Mykolaiv and Kherson in the country's south, military officials have said. Due to the successful actions of Ukrainian defenders, Russian forces 'lost control over several settlements on the border of Mykolaiv and Kherson regions', the latest intelligence report from Ukraine's general staff of the armed forces read. The Kremlin's official spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, denied reports that Moscow's forces were trying to storm the Azovstal plant. 'The order was publicly given by [Vladimir Putin] to cancel the storming,' Peskov said. 'There is no storming.' Russia said its forces would cease firing at the factory on Thursday morning, and open a three-day humanitarian corridor for any civilians. 'The Russian armed forces will from 8am to 6pm (Moscow time, 0500 GMT to 1500 GMT) on May 5, 6 and 7 open a humanitarian corridor from the territory of the Azovstal metallurgical plant to evacuate civilians,' the defence ministry said. 'During this period, the Russian armed forces and formations of the Donetsk People's Republic will unilaterally cease any hostilities.' The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in a national address on Wednesday night that another 344 people had been rescued from the centre of Mariupol and its suburbs on Wednesday. Zelenskiy said negotiations continued to rescue people trapped in the Azovstal steel works. 'There are still civilians. Women, children,' he added. It is not known whether any of the civilians trapped in the works, where about 200 people - including 30 -children - remain, were among those who got out on Wednesday.. On Tuesday, the Ukrainian MP Kira Rudik said 156 people had managed to leave Mariupol and reach the relative safety of Zaporizhzhia, 140 miles (230km) away, after at least 20 failed attempts to evacuate civilians from the Azovstal site. She told Sky News the main goal of aid workers 'is to make sure we get out all the children', adding: 'It's about 30 children who are still there. The most complicated step would be with the wounded soldiers, because Russia is not allowing them to get out.' Russia's defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said the remaining Ukrainian forces in the plant were 'securely blocked along the entire perimeter'. He claimed repeated proposals to 'release civilians and lay down their arms' had been ignored. Ukraine on Wednesday accused Moscow of planning to stage a military parade in Mariupol on 9 May, when Russia traditionally celebrates its victory over the Nazis in the second world war with processions in dozens of cities. 'Mariupol will become a centre of 'celebration',' Ukraine's military intelligence said in a statement on social media. 'The central streets of the city are urgently being cleaned of debris, bodies and unexploded ordnance.' It said an official from Russia's presidential administration had already arrived in the city, now almost entirely under Russian control, for a 'large-scale propaganda campaign. Russians will be shown stories of locals' 'joy' at meeting the occupiers.' Azovstal evacuees who arrived in Zaporizhzhia were emotional. 'We are so thankful for everyone who helped. There was a moment we lost hope, we thought everyone forgot about us,' said Anna Zaitseva, holding her six-month-old baby. Elyna Tsybulchenko, 54, said Russian forces 'bombed like every second'. 'Everything shook. Dogs barked and children screamed,' she told Agence France-Presse. 'The hardest moment was when we were told our bunker would not survive a direct hit.' After failing to capture Kyiv, Moscow has refocused its efforts on gaining full control of Luhansk and Donetsk, which make up the eastern Donbas region, and securing a southern land corridor via Mariupol to occupied Crimea. Ukraine's defence ministry said Russia was raising the tempo of its offensive and that it had conducted nearly 50 airstrikes on Tuesday. A ministry spokesperson, Oleksandr Motuzyanyk, said artillery bombardments and airstrikes were also continuing on the Azovstal plant. On Wednesday both sides reported Russian strikes on key transport infrastructure around the western city of Lviv, near Poland, and in Transcarpathia, bordering Hungary. There were also fears the conflict could spill over into neighbouring Moldova. The European Council president, Charles Michel, offered the republic the EU's 'full solidarity' and support. 'We plan to significantly increase our support to Moldova by providing its armed forces with additional military equipment,' he said during a visit. Russia's defence ministry said it had disabled six railway stations in eastern Ukraine used to supply Ukrainian forces with western-made weapons; hit 40 Ukrainian military targets including four ammunition and arms depots; and fired two cruise missiles at military targets from a submarine in the Black Sea. Moscow had deployed 22 battalion tactical groups near the eastern Ukrainian town of Izium, apparently in a drive to capture the nearby cities of Kramatorsk and Severodonetsk in Donbas, British military intelligence said. Shoigu said his forces would consider Nato transport units carrying weapons in Ukraine as targets to be destroyed. The alliance has said individual member states are sending military supplies, but not troops. The defence ministry of neighbouring, pro-Russia Belarus has announced military drills, saying they posed no threat, but Ukraine's border service said it could not exclude the possibility Belarusian forces might join Russia's assault. 'We are ready,' a spokesperson said. Ukraine remains defiant. 'Russia struggles to advance and suffers terrible losses,' the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, tweeted. 'Thus the desperate missile terror across Ukraine. But we are not afraid and the world should not be afraid either.'", "da476238f7803e9979adeed98b305e39ac1895b2b480f3b5b919a397": "Russian and Ukrainian forces appear to be settling into a gruelling and deadly stalemate in Ukraine's east, with warnings from a senior US military official that neither side can win in the present circumstances. Lt Gen Scott Berrier, the director of the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency, who gave evidence on Tuesday to the Senate armed forces committee, said: 'The Russians aren't winning and the Ukrainians aren't winning, and we're at a bit of a stalemate here.' The Russian military has claimed its forces have advanced as far as the border between the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, potentially edging towards securing control of the Donbas region. Russia and Ukraine have made inflated claims regarding their successes, with assessments emerging from western defence and intelligence officials in recent weeks often painting a more subdued picture. Heavy fighting is still raging at the besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, as Russian forces attempt to complete the capture of the strategically vital port. Hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers are holed up in the steel mill's underground bunkers, many of them wounded. It was thought that all remaining civilians were evacuated on Saturday, but on Tuesday an aide to the mayor said at least 100 were still to leave. In the months before its invasion Russia deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow's rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long considered the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia's ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups - the smallest operational unit in Russia's army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops - were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and Belarus before the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had 169,000-190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk - some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces - before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia's invasion pits the Kremlin's large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land, and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine's south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin's often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine would never join Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia's recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (PS8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia's state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany's north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe's most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe's energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.", "43b96e87051859602fa1a7ffcab40b203dd5752653e20a56caf9fc83": "", "3f1eafaea8510cc440a74116ea272d34fd996457e6f413bcb48c33e8": "The visit of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to Kyiv at the head of a congressional delegation this week was a reminder that in Washington the Ukraine war is not just an issue of national security but is an increasingly important domestic political issue too. In his approach to the conflict, Joe Biden, has the wind at his back in terms of US public opinion and Democratic party sentiment which is encouraging him to be ever more forward-leaning. In a new poll conducted by the Washington Post and ABC News, 37% of Americans questioned said his administration was not doing enough to support the Ukrainians, fractionally more than the 36% who said he was doing the right amount. Only 14% suggested he was doing too much. Late last month, the administration broadened US objectives in the conflict, to not just support Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity but also to weaken Russia, with the aim of preventing a repeat of Moscow's aggression against other countries. A European diplomat suggested that one of the factors behind that shift was impatience in the higher levels of the party with the administration's posture. 'It's fundamentally about trying to get on the front foot in this crisis. There's a lot of domestic criticism of the administration for being so passive,' the official said. 'The Hill [Congress] are cross and a lot of the big Democratic donors think it's not being as forthright as America should be ... Biden thinks he's treading a careful path between intervention in its broader sense and keeping the focus on domestic concerns - and some Democrats are starting to think that balance isn't right.' Senator Chris Coons, a senior figure in Democratic foreign policy circles, has criticised Biden for taking direct military intervention off the table as an option. On the other side of the party, there has been little pushback from the progressive wing, which is normally sceptical about sending large quantities of military hardware into foreign conflicts. And for once in Washington, the Republicans are pushing in the same direction. 'This is one of the few areas where Democrats and Republicans are reasonably well united and that makes it pretty easy for a president to move in that direction. He's not making enemies,' said Larry Sabato, politics professor at the University of Virginia. 'The umbrella over all of this is the moral issue and the powerful video of Ukrainians being slaughtered and dislocated,' John Zogby, a pollster and political consultant, said. 'Americans are moved by that and overwhelmingly support the Ukrainian people.' It is nonetheless a political wedge issue. Support is more uniform among Democrats than Republicans. Donald Trump transferred his personal admiration for Vladimir Putin to at least some of his followers and the Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson, who has consistently raised pro-Moscow talking points on his show. Democratic support is deepened by the important role of Ukrainian-Americans, thought to represent about 1 million people (Zogby thinks that is an underestimate) and who are influential on the party's ethnic coordinating council. They have all the more sway because they are concentrated in swing states. 'You've got a decent number of Ukrainians in Ohio, and you have a Senate race in Ohio. There are Ukrainians in Pennsylvania and you have a Senate race in Pennsylvania,' said Wendy Schiller, political science professor at Brown University. In Wisconsin, Democrats have been running ads against the incumbent Senator Ron Johnson, focusing on his 2018 visit to Moscow. 'It's not an accident that Nancy Pelosi went to Ukraine,' Schiller said. 'To have the speaker go, it says this is going to be an issue that the national party is going to take into the midterm elections.' With state-level and national politics, moral outrage among the public and Biden's own foreign policy instincts, all pointing in the same direction, the administration has sharply raised its stake in the Ukraine conflict, asking Congress for an extraordinary $33bn in military, economic and humanitarian support for Kyiv. Public support, however, dies away dramatically when it comes to the question of sending US troops. Only 21% asked in this week's poll backed such direct intervention, and concern about Ukraine escalating into a nuclear conflict is significantly higher among Democrats than Republicans. Biden, who has made extricating the US from 'forever wars' his signature foreign policy, has repeatedly said he will not send US troops into Ukraine, and has cancelled routine missile tests to reduce any risk of misunderstanding and miscalculation between the two nuclear superpowers. 'Boots on the ground may very well be a very different story,' Zogby said. 'I don't think world war three polls very well.'", "6bf047050c4e8e1fb55c970f2b22834be93ed673fa458e783b666978": "Brazilian presidential frontrunner Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has said the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, bear equal responsibility for the war in Ukraine, putting the leftist icon at odds with western powers. In an interview with Time magazine published on Wednesday, the former president said it was irresponsible for western leaders to celebrate Zelenskiy because they are encouraging war instead of focusing on closed-door negotiations to stop the fighting. 'I see the president of Ukraine, speaking on television, being applauded, getting a standing ovation by all the [European] parliamentarians,' Lula told the magazine. 'This guy [Zelenskiy] is as responsible as Putin for the war,' he added. Lula, who is on Time's cover this week, is frontrunner for the October elections when he hopes to deny far-right President Jair Bolsonaro re-election and return to office after the annulment last year of corruption convictions that had put him in jail. The remarks will probably raise eyebrows in the US and Europe, which are supplying military support to Ukraine and have hit Russia with punishing sanctions over an invasion widely seen in the west as an act of unprovoked Russian aggression. Lula, 76, said Zelenskiy should have yielded to Russian opposition to Ukraine's moves to join Nato and held negotiations with Putin to avoid a conflict. Refering to Zelenskiy's rise to fame as an actor and comedian, he added: 'We should be having a serious conversation. OK, you were a nice comedian. But let us not make war for you to show up on TV.' The veteran leftist said Biden and European Union leaders failed to do enough to negotiate with Russia in the run-up to its invasion of Ukraine in February. 'The United States has a lot of political clout. And Biden could have avoided war, not incited it,' he said. 'Biden could have taken a plane to Moscow to talk to Putin. This is the kind of attitude you expect from a leader.' The US and EU could have avoided the invasion by stating that Ukraine would not join Nato, he said. 'Putin shouldn't have invaded Ukraine. But it's not just Putin who is guilty. The US and the EU are also guilty,' Lula said Lula, who leads Bolsonaro in the polls for October's elections, was a key player on the international stage during his two terms as president, building Brazil's diplomatic clout. Portraying himself as a bridge-builder, he maintained friendly ties with counterparts as disparate as George W Bush of the US and Hugo Chavez of Venezuela or Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran.", "9014c1f2d171d7744f250370a3d976bcbb92dce037ceb90c2399430a": "Donald Trump's oldest son has met with the congressional committee investigating the January 6 insurrection, according to two people familiar with the matter. The interview Tuesday with Donald Trump Jr comes as the bipartisan House committee moves closer to the former president's inner circle of family members and political advisers. The younger Trump is of likely interest to the committee because of his proximity to his father on the day of the riot. Donald Trump Jr was seen backstage at the rally on the White House Ellipse that took place shortly before supporters of the then-president marched to the Capitol and breached the building. In several social media videos posted at the time of the January 6 attack, Trump Jr was seen with Kimberly Guilfoyle - then his girlfriend, now his fiancee - and other members of his family as his father prepared to make a speech that investigators believed rallied supporters to act violently that day. The House committee has also released text messages from 6 January 2021 in which Trump Jr pleaded with the White House to get his father to forcefully condemn the riot. 'We need an Oval address. He has to lead now. It has gone too far and gotten out of hand,' Trump Jr wrote to Mark Meadows, then the White House chief of staff. Trump Jr is one of nearly 1,000 witnesses the committee has interviewed as it works to compile a record of the worst attack on the Capitol in more than two centuries. He is the second of Trump's children known to speak to the committee; Ivanka Trump sat down with lawmakers for eight hours in early April. Her husband, Jared Kushner, has also been interviewed by the committee. Other allies of the former president have defied subpoenas from the committee and been referred to the justice department for potential prosecution on contempt of Congress charges. One of them, Stephen Bannon, was indicted last year after he refused to cooperate. That case is pending. The committee of seven Democrats and two Republicans is looking to wrap up its nearly 11-month investigation and shift into the public hearing phase. Hearings are set to begin 9 June and go on for four weeks. Lawmakers expect to bring out witnesses and present evidence in an effort to educate the public on the full scope of the attack and Donald Trump's role in it. Trump Jr is no stranger to congressional investigations, having testified at least three times in House and Senate investigations of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The two people who confirmed Trump Jr's interview were granted anonymity to discuss the private session, which was not announced by the committee.

Amid growing anger at what one official branded a 'scattergun approach' by Scotland Yard - including different people being sent questionnaires two months apart for the same event - the Metropolitan police are expected to make an announcement soon after the local elections, with expectations of further Partygate fines. The prime minister said on Tuesday he had not been contacted by the Met about a leaving party for his former spin doctor Lee Cain in November 2020. Sources said Met questionnaires, which can be a precursor to a fixed-penalty notice (FPN), had been sent to other people who attended. Johnson gave a speech and poured drinks at the leaving event for Cain on 13 November, according to those present, despite it being during a stay-at-home Covid lockdown. Police are also investigating an alleged party on the same night, held at the flat the prime minister shares with his wife, Carrie Johnson. Sources claim the event was to celebrate the departure of Cain and Johnson's former chief adviser Dominic Cummings. The prime minister has so far received one FPN, for attending a birthday gathering at No 10 in June 2020 for what he said was a matter of minutes, demonstrating that police deemed this crossed the threshold for breaking the law. Scotland Yard's approach to the Partygate investigation, Operation Hillman, has also frustrated MPs. 'The Met have blundered from the beginning, abdicating responsibility to [the senior civil servant] Sue Gray and then inserting themselves back into the narrative at just the moment we were approaching a resolution,' one MP said. 'Given the seriousness of the potential findings, the Met really must set out a sensible timetable for bringing their investigation to a conclusion.' Junior Downing Street staffers, who have received multiple questionnaires already from the Met, say there is significant disquiet about why Johnson has not been investigated over the same events, and the way the inquiry has been conducted. 'It feels there has been significant consideration about how to cause the least political impact - when someone is being investigated for a criminal offence,' an ex-official said. 'How is this allowed to happen?' Another said it was 'disgraceful how police are stringing this out, it's a scandal of historic proportions'. A Whitehall source brought up how the investigation had affected others who attended gatherings, including the civil servant Kate Josephs who has taken leave from a new role at Sheffield city council after her December 2020 Cabinet Office leaving party was identified as a lockdown breach.  One complication raised by a Whitehall source was the fact that police inquiries began with evidence gathered by Gray, the civil servant initially given the task of looking into alleged wrongdoing. She is believed to have gathered some details of events by speaking to a handful of attenders who volunteered information. Some officials who played relatively minor roles in gatherings now faced police action after assisting Gray, whereas others whose offences were arguably greater had not been contacted by officers. Asked by Times Radio on Tuesday whether he had received a Met questionnaire about the November 2020 leaving party, Johnson said: 'I am not commenting on this stuff generally, but the answer to that is no, not so far, or certainly not to my knowledge. All of this will become clear with the end of the investigation.' Johnson has been fined - along with Carrie Johnson and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak - over his birthday cake gathering. However, he does not appear to have been fined over a 'bring your own booze' party in the Downing Street garden in May 2020, for which others have been fined. In January, Johnson admitted attending the event - held during the first national lockdown when indoor and outdoor social mixing were banned - for about 25 minutes but claimed he 'believed implicitly that this was a work event'. His principal private secretary at the time, Martin Reynolds, is said to have invited up to 100 people to the 'socially distanced' evening drinks. Officials involved in the gatherings under investigation believe it is likely that Johnson will get another two fines - one for Cain's leaving do and another for the flat party on the same evening. However, Johnson is reported to be convinced he will not receive any further fines. The Met did not respond to requests for comment.", "38bb31041410852b93d4b97024098b58077f54c40fa7c1ce14100132": "Polls have opened in the local elections, with both major parties frenetically managing expectations as a Tory mayor warns Boris Johnson he will have to go further in helping people struggling with the cost of living. The results will be seen as a major test for Johnson and Keir Starmer, coming at the ostensible mid-way point of the UK government's term. A total of 146 English councils, and all those in Scotland and Wales, are up for grabs - as well as seven mayoralties. In Northern Ireland, voters will also elect 90 members to the devolved assembly in a contest from which Sinn Fein could emerge as the largest party. Coming after the prime minister and chancellor were fined for breaking Covid laws, the pressure is on the Conservatives to make some gains on councils across the country. The last time these seats in England were contested was 2018 and in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales it was 2017 - one of the lowest periods of the Conservative' party's popularity given deep divisions over the handling of Brexit by Theresa May. Tory MPs have indicated mixed responses on the doorstep, with those in the party's traditional southern heartlands concerned that voters will stay at home. Some are even plotting for a poor result to be the excuse to launch a fresh leadership challenge against Johnson. The Liberal Democrats' deputy leader, Daisy Cooper, accused Johnson of failing to visit many of the towns, villages and cities in the south of England that have become known as the 'blue wall'. She said: 'Your no-show in this election is an insult to millions of people.' Meanwhile, Tory peer and elections expert Robert Hayward said postal vote returns were down 'quite markedly' compared with 2018. He added: 'My expectation is therefore that turnout will be hard pushed to reach 30% in 2022. 'I don't think this will benefit any one party but more that the electorate is saying 'a plague on all your houses'.' Hayward told the Guardian he was staggered by the 'the range of expectation management by the two major parties', given Tory insiders fear the party could be on course to lose up to half the seats they are defending and some Labour figures have downplayed the chances of many gains. 'It's a bigger range than I've ever experienced before,' Hayward said. Andy Street, the Conservative mayor of the West Midlands, said that people would predominantly vote on 'local issues' - such as bin collections, schools and transport. He acknowledged the cost of living crisis was a 'genuine issue' and said Sunak had made 'some good first moves', but said the government would have to go further to mitigate the effects of spiralling energy bills, before the price cap is raised again in the autumn. Street told the Guardian: 'I'm expecting movement before the autumn and it looks sadly now as though that will be necessary, because we do seem to be heading into another price hike. So I'm expecting further moves.' Despite some candidates badging themselves as 'Local Conservatives' and urging voters not to punish them for 'mistakes made in Westminster', Street said there was 'an incredible goodwill' among people towards Johnson, and that he remained an electoral asset. In his closing pitch, Starmer tried to move attention on from questions about him drinking a beer with colleagues in April 2021 and stressed that voters would be motivated predominantly by the cost of living. Asked if Durham constabulary had contacted him in recent days, the Labour leader said: 'I have not had contact from Durham constabulary and I think people are just about fed up with the mudslinging that's going on.' 'This relentless focus on mudslinging instead of the issue in hand by the Conservatives means that they've got no answer to the real question that so many people want answered, which is: 'What are you going to do to help me with my bills?' 'We've got a clear answer to that, which is a windfall tax on oil and gas companies, and use that to help people pay their bills, up to PS600 off their bills.' Johnson also sought to downplay concerns about the Partygate scandal, and insisted he would still be leader of the Conservatives at the next general election. The prime minister said he was 'absolutely confident that we have the right agenda for the country', and added: 'I have a big mandate to deliver.' However, Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, said Johnson's leadership was a factor in encouraging some people to switch to his party because the prime minister was not a 'decent man'. He said: 'That's a group of lifelong Tories who are telling us they'll never vote Tory again while Boris Johnson's prime minister, and many of them are switching to us.'

The unidentified woman is the 10th survivor of the disaster in the city of Changsha, in which at least five people have died and an unknown number, possibly dozens, are still missing. She was rescued shortly after midnight on Thursday, about 132 hours after the rear of the six-storey building suddenly caved in on 29 April, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. The woman was conscious and advised rescuers on how to pull her out without causing further injury, Xinhua said. Teams had used dogs and hand tools as well as drones and electronic life detectors in the search. At least nine people have been arrested in relation to the collapse of what Xinhua has described as a 'self-built building,' including its owner, on suspicion of ignoring building codes or committing other violations. Also held were three people in charge of design and construction and five others who allegedly gave a false safety assessment for a guest house on the building's fourth to sixth floors. The building also held a residence, a cafe and shops. An increase in the number of collapses of self-built buildings in recent years prompted the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, to call last month for additional checks to uncover structural weaknesses. Poor adherence to safety standards, including the illegal addition of extra floors and failure to use reinforcing iron bars, is often blamed for such disasters.

British funding for 133 schools run by Syria Relief ended on 30 April, as the government cut its total foreign aid spending from its commitment of 0.7% of gross national income to 0.5%. 'If funds are not found to plug the gaps left by the UK government and other donors, a generation of children in northern Syria will be out of school and this will lead to a close-to-immediate rise in child labour, child marriage, early pregnancies, child conscription to military and armed groups, child exploitation and child trafficking,' said Jessica Adams, head of communications for Syria Relief and its parent charity, Action For Humanity. 'This was a political choice that we, and the children, parents and teachers of Syria, hope desperately will be reversed.' The details of the UK's 'rushed' PS4.2bn spending cuts in 2021 were revealed in March, and it was Syria that received the harshest cuts, despite millions of people still living in refugee and displacement camps more than 10 years after the conflict began. Spending on Syria was slashed by 69%, including cuts to programmes on education, health, maternal health and Palestinian refugees. Syria Relief said it had been the largest non-government provider of schools in Syria, with 306 schools. But with other donors also reducing spending or redirecting aid to Ukraine, it currently supports 3,600 children in 24 remaining schools, which face closure by August, leaving a total of 100,000 children left without an education since 2021. The charity said the closures would defeat the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office's stated goal of helping more girls into school and would push more girls into early marriages. 'If this school closes we will have to send them to schools that ask for money, but we don't have money, not even for rent, so we need the school to stay open,' said Abu Halid, whose children are at school in Mahmoodli camp for internally displaced people in northern Syria. According to Syria Relief, camp schools are overcrowded without electricity or heating. The charity said there are already high rates of child labour and early marriages among the war's displaced people, which are likely to quickly increase if more schools are shut. 'There are more than 2.4 million children out of school in Syria, and unless we significantly scale up our support, even more are at risk of dropping out. Rapid and substantial investments are now required to help us break the vicious cycle of suffering, violence and despair,' Joyce Msuya, assistant secretary general for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, told the UN security council last week.

The Airbus A330 jet was nearly 40 minutes into its journey to New York on Monday when the two pilots on board became aware of the 'rostering error', the airline said. Flight VS3 had reached the skies above Ireland before returning to Heathrow, touching down more than one and a half hours after it took off. A replacement for the first officer was found, and the plane departed again for New York. Virgin Atlantic insists that safety was not compromised. The initial first officer joined the carrier in 2017. He was fully qualified under UK aviation regulations, but had not completed a final assessment flight, which is part of the airline's internal requirements. Flight VS3 turned back as the captain had not been designated as a trainer. Control of an aircraft is usually shared between a first officer and the captain, but the latter holds ultimate responsibility for what happens on a flight. A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said: 'Due to a rostering error, flight VS3 from London Heathrow to New York-JFK returned to Heathrow on Monday 2 May shortly after take-off. 'The qualified first officer, who was flying alongside an experienced captain, was replaced with a new pilot to ensure full compliance with Virgin Atlantic's training protocols, which exceed industry standards.

Heard took the witness stand in a Virginia court on Wednesday afternoon during Depp's defamation lawsuit against her - a make-or-break moment for the actors in a four-week trial that had so far largely focused on Depp's version of events during their turbulent 15-month marriage. She described how during a weekend away with friends in May 2013, Depp tore her dress, ripped off her underwear and stuck his fingers 'inside' her. 'He proceeds to do a cavity search,' she said. 'He's looking for his drugs, his cocaine.' Earlier in the hearing, the psychologist Dawn Hughes testified that Heard told her Depp had put his fingers up her vagina to search for cocaine. At one point in their relationship, Heard also alleged during her witness statement that Depp held her by the neck and warned he could 'kill me'. Speaking at the hearing, she said: 'I struggle to find the words to describe how painful this is ... this is horrible for me to sit here for weeks and relive everything, to hear people that I knew, some well, some not, my ex-husband with whom I shared a life, speak about our lives in the way they have.' She added: 'This has been one of the most painful and difficult things I've ever gone through, for sure.'  Heard described typical activities from her upbringing in Texas, ranging from breaking in horses to working at her father's construction company, where she answered phones, then working at a modelling agency, where she earned enough to have professional photographs taken, and her move to Hollywood. 'I went from slightly bigger role to slightly bigger role, and worked my butt off,' Heard said. She had met Depp when she auditioned for Bruce Robinson's The Rum Diary. 'I was the dream kid, that's what he told me,' Heard testified. During filming in Puerto Rico in 2011, the actors were scripted to kiss. 'It didn't feel like a normal scene in the job, the lines were blurred. He grabbed my face and pulled me in and really kissed me.' Heard was asked if he used his tongue. 'Yes,' she said. In her trailer, she said, 'he kind of picked up the back of my robe with his boot and I kind of turned around and giggled ... He kind of playfully pushed me down on this bed, sofa. Playful and flirtatious. 'And he said, 'Yum.' And kind of lifted his eyebrows up like that.' Depp's seduction continued, she said, with Heard 'batting him away'. After the filming was complete, she said, they parted. 'We were both in relationships. It was intimidating, and we went our separate ways.' Months later, she said, Depp called her out of the blue and invited Heard to his house in Beverly Hills, ostensibly to have a drink with him and Robinson. 'It was clearly not about the movie, if you know what I mean,' she said. Depp, she said sent her a dress he described as wrapping paper - 'happy wrapping', he wrote. He sent guitars and other gifts. Finally, on the Rum Diary press tour in London, they slept together, she said. 'He kissed me and I kissed him back. It was a beautiful and strange time. We were falling in love. For the rest of the press tour it was on, let's put it that way.' Depp invited her to his house in the Bahamas, she said. 'It felt like a dream, like absolute magic. 'I fell head over heels in love with this man,' she told the court. 'When I was with him, I felt electricity in my body. I had butterflies. I couldn't see straight. I felt like this man knew me, saw me, in a way so one else had.' But, Heard testified, Depp began to 'just disappear, and you couldn't get hold of him. He'd disappear and come back. He'd be different.' Heard testified about the first time Depp allegedly hit her, telling the jury: 'I'll never forget it. It changed my life.' The two were sitting on a couch, drinking, she said. A 'jar of cocaine' sat nearby, the court heard, and Heard asked Depp about the 'Wino Forever' tattoo on his arm. 'You think it's funny, bitch?' he said after hitting her, she testified. 'I laughed because I didn't know what else to do. I thought this must be a joke,' she said. 'I didn't move, freak out, because I didn't know what else to do,' she told the court. 'Then he slapped me again one more time. Hard. I lose my balance on edge of couch and I wished so much he'd say he was joking.' Heard said Depp slapped her again. Depp then got down on his knees and sobbed, she said. 'I will never do that again, I'm so sorry, baby ... I thought I put the monster away,' Depp said, she testified. Heard said she knew she had to leave, but didn't want to. 'I wish I could say I stood up and walked out of the house but I didn't,' she said. 'I was heartbroken.' Depp, she said, called a few days later to say 'he would rather cut [his] hand off' than lay it on her. Depp, Heard said, criticised her choice of clothes - about 'pouring herself out' in a low-cut dress at a charity event. Then 'there'd be a blow-up. He'd smash things,' Heard told the court. 'He loves to break furniture,' she said, and would often 'smash up a place'. Heard said she noticed a pattern of escalation. Heard testified that Depp was deeply jealous and that his jealousy turned their relationship into 'a never-ending fight'. 'It was a revolving door of accusations,' Heard told the jury. 'I was an acquaintance with someone. And he was accusing me of having an affair with them.' At times, Heard said, Depp would disappear to get clean and sober. 'When he was done, he'd go back to being this unbelievable, warm, generous, kind man that I loved.' But Depp's negative behavior returned, she said, and she began to predict his moods and behaviour. 'What kept me in it was waiting for the other shoe to drop, the sobriety shoe,' Heard said, adding that she held on to the hope he would eventually be 'ready to get clean and sober again'. 'Johnny on speed is very different from Johnny on opiates. And Johnny on opiates is very different from Johnny on Adderall, and Cocaine Johnny, which is very different from Quaaludes Johnny,' Heard testified. On one occasion, she came down to breakfast to find the kitchen table littered with alcohol and cocaine, and Depp agitated. 'I realised I wasn't going to talk our situation down. He was intent on me admitting an affair I wasn't having,' Heard said. Heard said she convinced Depp to leave the house with her to get him to work. On the car-ride, she said, Depp held one of the couple's teacup Yorkies out of the car window while howling. Heard said: 'Everyone in the car just froze. Nobody did anything. He's howling and holding this dog out of the window. No one reacted, no one did anything.' Heard went on to testify that Depp, who she said was drinking, threatened to kill her while the two were in the Bahamas to sail on his yacht before it was sold to the author JK Rowling. 'He slams me up by my neck and holds me there for a second and tells me that he could fucking kill me and that I was an embarrassment,' she said. His daughter, Lily-Rose Depp, was upset by her father's behaviour, Heard said, and Depp attacked her because he thought she had told his children about his addictions. Heard then left the island taking Lily-Rose with her. In court, Depp shook his head and said, 'Wow.' Heard also testified that her former husband would pass out and lose control of his bodily functions. 'This man lost control of his bowels and I cleaned up after him,' she said. 'He passed out in his own sick ... and then he'd walk around saying he didn't have a problem,' Heard testified. 'No one told him. No one was honest with him,' she said of the people around Depp. Depp, 58, testified that he never struck Heard, and that, in fact, he was the victim of abuse, and was punched and struck by his wife on many occasions. Depp described Heard to the jury as having a 'need for conflict'.", "adba503b9a13c934987827839f19e69c48de83867e280ab82fe6c19a": "When most people toss a plastic bottle or cup into the recycling bin, they assume that means the plastic is recycled - but a new report lays bare how rarely that actually happens. According to the Last Beach Cleanup and Beyond Plastics, the organization behind the report released on Wednesday, the recycling rate for post-consumer plastic was just 5% to 6% in 2021. The Department of Energy also released a research paper this week, which analyzed data from 2019, and came to the same number: only 5% of plastics are being recycled. The researchers on that report wrote that landfilled plastic waste in the United States has been on the rise for many reasons, including 'low recycling rates, population growth, consumer preference for single-use plastics, and low disposal fees in certain parts of the country', according to a press release. The problem has also been exacerbated by shifts in the global recycling market, including China's 2017 ban on most US plastic exports. Countries such as China used to accept ships full of plastic waste from the US, says Jan Dell, founder of the Last Beach Cleanup, but without that option, more plastic is ending up thrown away, since few US facilities have the capacity to recycle it. 'The rate of plastic recycling in the US has never been about 4% to 5% ever,' she says. 'We don't have factories to do it. It's also very water intensive, so we're not going to build more plastic recycling facilities in the US.' Around 85% of plastics end up in landfills, and the remaining 10% are incinerated, according to Dell's research. And even when plastics are recycled, about a third of the material from a PET plastic bottle is discarded in the process. The Last Beach Cleanup and Beyond Plastics's report also revealed that while plastic recycling is on the decline, the generation of plastic waste per person in the US has increased by 263% since 1980, from 60 pounds a person to 218 pounds a person. Plastics stand out as egregiously wasteful in the world of recycling: paper is recycled at 66%, according to the American Forest Products Association, while the figure for aluminum cans is about 50.4%, according to the EPA. 'We can't stay in the single use plastic nightmare scenario that we are right now,' says Dell. 'There's no way to sort our way out of this without reducing waste to start with.' Dell says that solutions exist to replace single-use plastics - for example, fiber-based food trays that can be composted or recycled. She says Nestle has replaced plastic with paper on candy in the UK - something they're calling 'paperification'. And of course, reusing and refilling bottles rather than tossing them after use also helps. She adds that the plastic producers have been deceptive in slapping the triangular 'chasing arrows' shape on the bottom of products and misleading people into thinking they are recyclable, when in fact the symbol does not guarantee that. 'They have co-opted America's love of recycling and the thought that we are doing something good for the environment, when they knew all along it wasn't recycling,' she says. 'They leveraged the heartstrings of consumers and said this stuff was recyclable.' Bans on single-use plastic items such as bags, food containers and utensils are increasingly popular, with versions adopted in places including the European Union, the state of California, and Los Angeles. But such rules need to go further, the report says. 'Proven solutions that will reduce US plastic waste and pollution already exist and can be swiftly enacted. The success of single-use plastic bans, water refilling stations, and reusable food and dish ware can be extended nationwide.'", "7fc0375599ce5c48c678b973fdb4c924a5713f8c2e7d759fd7654c55": "The Bank of England is likely to raise interest rates to the highest level since the recession caused by the 2008 financial crisis, despite mounting concern that the economy is weakening amid the cost of living crisis. City economists widely expect the Bank will increase its base rate by at least 0.25 percentage points to 1% on Thursday, lifting borrowing costs to the match the level set in February 2009 when it was in the process of cutting rates to historic lows as the global financial system imploded. Households across Britain are under intense pressure from soaring living costs - with inflation at 7%, the highest level since 1992 - driven by record petrol prices and rising gas and electricity costs exacerbated by Russia's war in Ukraine. Experts have warned the gauge for the annual jump in consumer prices could reach 10% later this year, five times the Bank's 2% target. Central banks around the world have begun raising rates to combat high inflation. On Wednesday the US Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by 0.5 percentage points to a target rate range of between 0.75% and 1%. It was the largest since 2000 and follows a 0.25 percentage point increase in March, the first increase since December 2018. Analysts said the Bank of England's monetary policy committee was set to vote overwhelmingly for its fourth consecutive rate rise since it began increasing borrowing costs in December for the first time since the Covid pandemic. Raising rates to 1% would also open the door to the Bank selling down some of its PS875bn portfolio of UK government bonds built up through its quantitative easing stimulus programme since the 2008 financial crisis. With heightened volatility in financial markets over recent weeks, analysts said the Bank would probably lay the ground for future asset sales rather than take immediate action, although disposals of PS5bn a month could be made from as early as the summer. Economists said some of the nine-strong panel could push for a 0.5 percentage point rise to show commitment to stopping persistently high rates of inflation from taking hold, although cautioned that a quarter-point rise was still most likely. Concerns are, however, growing that high inflation could give way to a recession should the soaring cost of living, rising taxes and higher borrowing costs severely damage UK consumer spending, in a development that would force the Bank to drastically reconsider plans for future rate rises. Signs of weakness have emerged in recent weeks, including an unexpectedly large decline in March retail sales and consumer confidence in April dropping to the second-lowest level in almost 50 years. Several leading economists said this could tempt Jon Cunliffe, the Bank's deputy governor, to cast another lone vote to keep rates on hold after taking that position at the MPC's last meeting in March. Kallum Pickering, a senior economist at Berenberg, said a cautious approach was probably appropriate: 'Amid plunging consumer confidence and evidence of a pullback in household demand, [raising rates] is not without risk, in our view. 'If we are unlucky, the UK is already in the early stage of a recession.'", "bc2c864483e920478782338a9b303af9c6e3ccd141d11e5de5bb9867": "Visibly shaking with fury and brandishing megaphones and posters, thousands of women defending reproductive rights in America thronged below the marbled columns of the US supreme court to protest against what appears to be the imminent demise of the 1973 Roe v Wade ruling recognizing abortion as a constitutional right. 'Do something, Democrats,' the crowd chanted at one point. In the hours that followed, Democrats, who control the House, the Senate and the White House, echoed their outrage and vowed a response. The urgency follows a leak late on Monday evening of a draft opinion from the court that a majority of the nine judges on the bench - all conservative-leaning appointees of Republican presidents - support not just more restrictions on abortion services but the overturning of the landmark Roe ruling that guarantees the right to abortion when final opinions are issued in June. 'I am furious - furious that Republicans could be this cruel, that the supreme court could be this heartless, that in legislatures across the country, extreme Republicans are ready for their trigger bans to go into effect,' Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat of Washington and a longtime advocate of women's reproductive rights, said. Speaking from the steps of the US Capitol, she was referring to states that have legislative bans on abortion prepared and waiting to be 'triggered' into effect as soon as Roe is overturned.  'It is craven and we won't stand for it,' she said. 'I'm not going to sit quietly and neither should any of you.' Yet, infuriatingly for the pro-choice voters who helped elect Joe Biden and a Democratic Congress, the party finds itself largely powerless at present, without a legislative path forward to protect abortion rights in the likely event the court reverses its decision in Roe. Biden said it would be a 'radical decision' by the court and called on Congress to act to enshrine the rights afforded by Roe into federal law via legislation. And Vice-President Kamala Harris, speaking to attendees at a gala hosted by Emily's List, which works to elect Democrats who support abortion rights, railed that a ruling overturning Roe would be a 'direct assault on freedom' in America. Barring swift legislative action, nearly half of US states are likely to ban abortion or severely restrict access to the procedure. But the reality of Democrats' thin congressional majorities is that they don't have enough support in the evenly divided US Senate to codify abortion protections, nor do they have the votes to eliminate the so-called filibuster rule, thus allowing legislation to pass with a simple majority. Biden has resisted pressure from progressives to use his bully pulpit to call for eliminating the filibuster, following recent demands to do so to pass voting rights legislation. And on Tuesday, he said he was 'not prepared' to do so to protect reproductive rights. Nevertheless, the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, vowed to forge ahead with a vote on legislation that is stalled in Congress but if passed would establish a woman's right to end her pregnancy. But the measure, a version of which passed the Democratic-controlled House last year, was already rejected once this year, when it fell far short of the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster. It didn't even win the support of all 50 Democrats, so even if the filibuster were scrapped the bill, called the Women's Health Protection Act, would not have passed in the Senate. Senator Joe Manchin, an anti-abortion Democrat from West Virginia, voted with Republicans to block consideration of the bill. The bill also failed to attract the support of two pro-choice Senate Republicans, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who have introduced separate legislation that they say would codify Roe. Yet Schumer argued that it was important to put every senator on the record. 'A vote on this legislation is no longer an abstract exercise. This is as urgent and real as it gets,' he said.  The leaked draft decision, written by the conservative justice Samuel Alito, would shift the question of whether abortion should be legal to the individual states. The effect would dramatically alter the US landscape almost overnight, with restrictions and bans going into effect across much of the south and midwest while abortion would remain legal in many north-eastern and western states. Emboldened by the supreme court's conservative super-majority, Republican legislatures have enacted a flurry of new abortion laws as conservative activists begin to lay the groundwork for a nationwide ban. On Tuesday, as the country reeled from the revelation that the supreme court was likely to dismantle Roe, Oklahoma's Republican governor signed into law a bill that would ban abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, a copycat version of a Texas law enacted last year. Meanwhile, liberal states have moved to safeguard abortion protections. Last week, Connecticut lawmakers approved a bill that would protect abortion providers in the state. And states like California and New York have vowed to be a 'sanctuary' for people seeking reproductive care from places where the procedure is banned. With few options, Democrats have implored Americans shocked and angered by the seemingly impending loss of abortion rights to vote in the midterm elections. Majorities of Americans say they want abortion to remain legal in some or most cases. Few say they want the court to overturn Roe. But Democrats face steep headwinds in November, weighed down by Biden's low approval ratings, rising inflation and a sour national mood. The Republican reaction to the news that the nation's highest court was prepared to strike down Roe was relatively subdued. In the Senate, lawmakers were far more focused on the source of the leaked document than the decision, which is the culmination of a decades-long drive by the conservative movement to overturn Roe. The response suggested that there may be some concern that Republicans are worried about provoking a political backlash among more moderate and independent voters who broadly support a constitutional right to abortion. 'There's an answer,' the Illinois senator Dick Durbin, the majority whip, said at a press conference. 'The answer is in November.' But many Democrats and activists believe November is too late for millions of women in states where abortion will banned almost immediately. They want the party - from the president on down - to throw every ounce of their political capital at finding a legislative solution. 'People elected Democrats precisely so we could lead in perilous moments like these - to codify Roe, hold corruption accountable, & have a President who uses his legal authority to break through Congressional gridlock on items from student debt to climate,' Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a progressive Democrat from New York, wrote on Twitter. 'It's high time we do it.'", "e25a209d91e11570965324d2ccb576358f73e52b6bf1ac144e2af158": "", "2414533cfdf7d366fdf8cd9530e4f7aecf54d765c43de9196f47444f": "", "8094c4fbcbd1a0b4d6ca629643f24ca14bf1a86cbe7021762d8c22d0": "", "b2e1b409df4d4fd75cd8b1766b71eaa24ffe2e52d489557e65cb3359": "", "db1915e270a64ff96c4f800c18cf53ac61a351abb99340338ef216a7": "", "6bb03e4a009da6a491e54260e849897a392b6f070ce8451b9ea34c4c": "", "7b0488e943f9a56525f9895eef2d830487f201cef8feaa2e3ef8a5e1": "", "6dc3d00de4094ff0af318a9269dcaa2e82f4907a6abd8f9e96ea0253": "", "79e1deab5ccb7d17dea8cd073d0823f0a3e0c715e4637fcf9f0ab802": "", "1fe7c3947f5797c8b094033528b5df8b835ebdc3ecf8f1a42c57d9e5": "", "1e777f29bde52e02cde3207c6525a00026f44bb55a99f2c11b399101": "", "59020d60be763453fbed92fd834b47888ca533022af7911f51ee46e9": "", "91bbc379a7ebba4b97459c4ae14815fdc1c035f29f5aede93127a9e9": "", "f4f55a48754bddda97ceefe57d3b7ccd1ef6645b84ff4690fce2cea9": "", "93119b7c666675f93986cfece4f37f570a515a4eb489b0ae9e135a0e": "", "b35c1670308adaa94dc3c25a9f6274b9e300cefd9d0763754f8c21f7": "", "2267f965e757605c3e8ec08476cdc98d100d44cf11d3a11215f1894b": "", "47e72f3ca830ed17c17b831844661b0f5841d0acf7694bf43ea9dadf": "", "88b6c26dbca2562991c651d34c1c25e61dd4a67c57d48090ec621559": "", "ee6bbb98efab2eda83de5f5c1ec359b52de048b80eefcf52ad8f5daa": "Brussels officials are being trained to meditate to help them tackle the climate crisis as part of a new wave of 'applied mindfulness' that seeks to take the Buddhism-inspired practice 'off the cushion' and into hard politics. EU officials working on the 27-country bloc's green deal climate policy are attending 'inner green deal' courses intended to foster a deeper connection among decision-makers and negotiators tasked with tackling the crisis. The courses incorporate woodland walks near Brussels and meditation sessions, including one that invites participants to feel empathy for trees and animals to boost 'environmental compassion'. Some managers have reportedly shown impatience at being asked to meditate and want to 'get on with business'. But early results from the first 80 participants suggest the course has strengthened officials' motivation to tackle climate problems and overcome personal despair that little can be done. Mindfulness has boomed in the west in recent years through courses, meditation apps and books. But it has drawn criticism that it has become a 'religion of the self', with one critic warning of 'McMindfulness'. However, it is recognised by the NHS as an effective treatment for recurrent depression when delivered as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy. Now advocates of 'applied mindfulness' believe it could accelerate consensus-building between climate decision-makers. A recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlighted the need for 'inner transitions' and the potential of meditation to encourage lower-carbon lifestyles. Some UK MPs are backing a policy report launched this week that argues examining the human heart and mind is the 'missing dimension' in the global response to the climate crisis. The report, overseen by the Mindfulness Initiative, which supports the UK parliament's all-party group on mindfulness, says tackling climate breakdown has too long been framed as a problem of technology rather than compassion and empathy, and this is holding back humanity's ability to move faster. Supporters include the former UN climate negotiator Christiana Figueres and the UK's only Green party MP, Caroline Lucas. The report argues the climate emergency is rooted in 'a crisis of relationship that has us treating the world we belong to as a resource to be exploited, and the other people in it primarily as competitors'. It calls urgently for policy attention to 'the neglected inner dimension of the climate crisis' and argues for 'the importance of mindfulness and compassion practices in restoring the conscious connection fundamental to human and planetary health'. Applying mindfulness, it argues, can help decision-makers mentally 'stay with' the often overwhelming problem humanity is facing rather than fleeing it. Figueres, who led the landmark 2015 Paris climate accord negotiations, told the Guardian her practice of 'deep listening', which is related to mindfulness and emerges from Buddhist teaching, was 'the key' to the successful agreement. 'Had I not been practising deep listening I never would have understood where 195 countries and thousands of stakeholders were coming from,' she said. 'I really wanted to know deeply what they were saying. I chalk up a lot of the Paris accord to deep listening.' Lucas said: 'Mindfulness is about making the space to feel the connections that could then inspire action. Reaching into people's deeper empathy for the world is a way of generating the extra energy, motivation and belief that change is possible.' She is among a group of MPs who meditate regularly together at parliament and she said the practice 'keeps me on track by reminding myself, amid the noise and distraction of political life, of what's important'. Under the EU's training package, officials learn mindfulness practices before being presented with raw facts about the climate emergency. They then explore how they personally relate to problems that can seem overwhelming. Jeroen Janss, who runs the course, said strong emotions often arose, including deep sadness, frustration over lack of progress, guilt and hopelessness. Participants learn how to regulate these emotions, find their personal role and, through collaborating around concrete initiatives, come out with a sense of agency. 'They feel 'I can do something',' said Janss. 'There is less eco-anxiety.' 'There is a lot of power in even one or two people being fully present in a meeting,' said one policy officer working on EU-wide climate negotiations who has taken the course. 'The inner dimension has been missing for some time and it has the potential to unlock how we collaborate.'", "ac9387d5c19724675bae6a61b166833733a07fdf374e00d15d8f0868": "An influential thinktank that has led the backlash against the government's net zero policy has received funding from groups with oil and gas interests, according to tax documents seen by the Guardian and OpenDemocracy. Though the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) has always said it is independent of the fossil fuel industry, the revelations about its funding will raise questions over its campaigning. The thinktank has always refused to disclose its donors, but tax documents filed with US authorities reveal that one of its donors has $30m (PS24m) of shares in 22 companies working in coal, oil and gas. Over four years the GWPF's US arm, the American Friends of the GWPF, received more than $1m from US donors. The vast majority of this, $864,884, was channelled to the UK group, with some being held back for expenses. Of the PS1.45m the GWPF has received in charitable donations since 2017, about 45% has come from the US. It received $210,525 in 2018 and 2020 from the Sarah Scaife Foundation - set up by the billionaire libertarian heir to an oil and banking dynasty. The US-based foundation has $30m-worth of shares in 22 energy companies including $9m in Exxon and $5.7m in Chevron, according to its financial filings. Between 2016 and 2020, the American Friends of the GWPF received $620,259 from the Donors Trust, which is funded by the Koch brothers, who inherited their father's oil empire and have spent hundreds of millions of dollars funding the climate denial movement. 'It is disturbing that the Global Warming Policy Foundation is acting as a channel through which American ideological groups are trying to interfere in British democracy,' said Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the LSE Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment. The GWPF was set up by Lord Lawson, a former Conservative chancellor, in 2009, to challenge the 'costs and implications' of measures to tackle climate change. Since then, it has gained prominence in UK politics, counting Conservative MPs and peers as supporters and trustees. Craig Mackinlay, who runs the Net Zero Scrutiny Group (NZSG), a committee of about 20 parliamentarians, has supported the GWPF in its campaigning and two advisers to the GWPF were recently hired by Mackinlay's parliamentary office as researchers. The NZSG says it does not question climate science, but exists to question the costs of reaching net zero. Steve Baker, the Wycombe MP who has led much of the criticism towards the government's net zero policies, is a trustee of the GWPF and vocally supports the group, recently sharing a report by the thinktank that denied the climate emergency exists. He is a prominent member of the NZSG, and has recently campaigned for fracking, inviting the shale gas industry to speak to MPs and members of the rightwing press in parliament. After campaigning from the NZSG, the government recently declared that fracking companies would be allowed to continue their research in the UK. Shale gas wells that were supposed to be filled in with concrete this summer have been given a new lease of life, after campaigning from Baker, Mackinlay and others associated with the NZSG. There are fears that the UK's net zero ambitions could be watered down with further campaigning from MPs on the right of the party. The Guardian has asked Baker and Mackinlay whether they would reconsider their connections to the GWPF in light of the news about the thinktank's funding. Mackinlay said: 'Do look at my staff declarations of interests as properly recorded in the parliamentary register; all totally transparent and for the world to see. Make of it whatever you wish.' Baker said the allegations 'appear to be ridiculous', adding: 'It is an extraordinary fact that the same newspapers and commentators who would usually be the first to protest any kind of poverty are wasting the public's time with these attempts to distract from the real issues at hand. It would be better if the political world focused their attention on how our current energy strategy has driven up energy prices and contributed to the terrible cost-of-living crisis that so many are experiencing.' The funding has caused fears that the culture wars over climate denial in the US could be being imported to UK politics, and funded by billionaires with links to 'big oil'. Ed Miliband, the shadow climate secretary, said: 'US rightwing groups with links to big oil are desperate to stop action against the climate crisis. Now they are trying to extend their reach into UK political debate. 'Opposing action on the climate emergency will drive up bills for consumers because green power is now cheaper, cleaner, and quicker than fossil fuels.' Already the rumblings of a culture war have begun, with the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage calling for a referendum on net zero, and Baker, a vital figure in the Brexit campaign, declaring he wanted to 'do for net zero what [he] did for Brexit'. A spokesperson for the GWPF said: 'We do not accept donations from anyone with an interest in an energy company. We turn down many offers of funding from people with vested interests. I am not sure this is true of any group on the other side of the debate. 'Donor's Trust is a middleman, matching donors to those seeking funding. Disbursements are not made from a homogenous pool of money - recipients of funds know the identity of the original donors. We are therefore able to vet them in line with our funding policy. 'I suggest you also consider what constitutes an 'interest'. Money that is inherited does not create an 'interest', let alone a vested one. The wealth that ultimately created the Scaife Foundation was created at the end of the 19th century and the start of the 20th. It would be ludicrous to suggest that three generations on, it represents an oil company interest.'", "8786e16f7813f5d06ffcf451dc6e54202e74039c294d30fc5b9bc3e1": "For the past few weeks, Nazeer Ahmed has been living in one of the hottest places on Earth. As a brutal heatwave has swept across India and Pakistan, his home in Turbat, in Pakistan's Balochistan region, has been suffering through weeks of temperatures that have repeatedly hit almost 50C (122F), unprecedented for this time of year. Locals have been driven into their homes, unable to work except during the cooler night hours, and are facing critical shortages of water and power. Ahmed fears that things are only about to get worse. It was here, in 2021, that the world's highest temperature for May was recorded, a staggering 54C. This year, he said, feels even hotter. 'Last week was insanely hot in Turbat. It did not feel like April,' he said. As the heatwave has exacerbated massive energy shortages across India and Pakistan, Turbat, a city of about 200,000 residents, now barely receives any electricity, with up to nine hours of load shedding every day, meaning that air conditioners and refrigerators cannot function. 'We are living in hell,' said Ahmed. It has been a similar story across the subcontinent, where the realities of climate change are being felt by more than 1.5 billion people as the scorching summer temperatures have arrived two months early and the relief of the monsoons are months away. North-west and central India experienced the hottest April in 122 years, while Jacobabad, a city in Pakistan's Sindh province, hit 49C on Saturday, one of the highest April temperatures ever recorded in the world. The heatwave has already had a devastating impact on crops, including wheat and various fruits and vegetables. In India, the yield from wheat crops has dropped by up to 50% in some of the areas worst hit by the extreme temperatures, worsening fears of global shortages following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has already had a devastating impact on supplies. In Balochistan's Mastung district, known for its apple and peach orchards, the harvests have been decimated. Haji Ghulam Sarwar Shahwani, a farmer, watched in anguish as his apple trees blossomed more than a month early, and then despair as the blossom sizzled and then died in the unseasonal dry heat, almost killing off his entire crop. Farmers in the area also spoke of a 'drastic' impact on their wheat crops, while the area has also recently been subjected to 18-hour power cuts. 'This is the first time the weather has wreaked such havoc on our crops in this area,' Shahwani said. 'We don't know what to do and there is no government help. The cultivation has decreased; now very few fruits grow. Farmers have lost billions because of this weather. We are suffering and we can't afford it.' Sherry Rehman, Pakistan's minister for climate, told the Guardian that the country was facing an 'existential crisis' as climate emergencies were being felt from the north to south of the country. Rehman warned that the heatwave was causing the glaciers in the north of the country to melt at an unprecedented rate, and that thousands were at risk of being caught in flood bursts. She also said that the sizzling temperatures were not only impacting crops but water supply as well. 'The water reservoirs dry up. Our big dams are at dead level right now, and sources of water are scarce,' she said. Rehman said the heatwave should be a wake-up call to the international community. 'Climate and weather events are here to stay and will in fact only accelerate in their scale and intensity if global leaders don't act now,' she said. Experts said the scorching heat being felt across the subcontinent was likely a taste of things to come as global heating continues to accelerate. Abhiyant Tiwari, an assistant professorand programme manager at the Gujarat Institute of Disaster Management, said 'the extreme, frequent, and long-lasting spells of heatwaves are no more a future risk. It is already here and is unavoidable.' The World Meteorological Organisation said in a statement that the temperatures in India and Pakistan were 'consistent with what we expect in a changing climate. Heatwaves are more frequent and more intense and starting earlier than in the past.' A heatwave is declared when the maximum temperature is over 40C and at least 4.5C above normal. Over the weekend in India, Bikaner was the hottest place in the country at 47.1C, according to the India Meteorological Department. However, in some parts of north-west India, images captured by satellites showed that surface land temperatures had exceeded 60C - unprecedented for this time of year when usual surface temperatures are between 45 and 55C. 'The hottest temperatures recorded are south-east and south-west of Ahmedabad, with maximum land-surface temperatures of around 65C,' the European Space Agency said on its website. The high temperatures have put massive pressure on power demand in both India and Pakistan, where people have had to endure hours of power cuts amid the crippling heat. On Friday, the peak power demand in India touched an all-time high of 207,111MW, according to the government. India is facing its worst electricity shortage in six decades. Power cuts lasting upwards of eight hours have been imposed in states including Jharkhand, Haryana, Bihar, Punjab and Maharashtra as domestic coal supplies have fallen to critical levels and the price of imported coal has soared. In a bid to speed up the transport of coal across the country, Indian Railways cancelled more than 600 passenger and postal train journeys to make way for transportation of coal to power plants.", "72a4043d9666739543908fdbd15290651ae9c53e75ade72f145bcd4d": "The shock over China's security deal with Solomon Islands is evidence of 'a relationship failure' , New Zealand's foreign affairs minister has said, confirming that the pact took New Zealand, Australia and other Pacific nations completely by surprise. The deal marks Beijing's first known bilateral security agreement in the Pacific. The text of the final deal is secret, but a draft leaked on social media in March granted Chinese military and police significant access to the country, allowing China to 'make ship visits to, carry out logistical replenishment in, and have stopover and transition in Solomon Islands'. While there had been some knowledge of overtures from Beijing to the Solomons on policing, the deal's scope came as a surprise to officials in Australia, Aotearoa New Zealand and across the Pacific. Speaking on Monday, Nanaia Mahuta told the Guardian that New Zealand's first knowledge of the deal was when a draft was leaked online at the end of March, reinforcing statements from the defence minister, Peeni Henare, that it had caught Australia and New Zealand off-guard. 'In terms of the detail of any security agreement, it would be fair to say that probably very few of the Pacific nations, New Zealand included, will have been aware of the detail of those discussions - or, in fact, how far those discussions had progressed to something material,' Mahuta said. She condemned the deal as 'unwelcome and unnecessary', and said in March that it 'could destabilise the current institutions and arrangements that have long underpinned the Pacific region's security'. On whether the two countries were surprised by specific details of the deal, or its very existence, the minister responded: 'Both.' However, Australian politicians have been circumspect about whether the draft deal came as a surprise. Australia's foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, and the Pacific minister, Zed Seselja, both confirmed they did not know of the deal until it was leaked online at the end of March, but the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has refused to answer questions about what he knew, or when. Behind the scenes, Australian officials briefed some media outlets that Australian intelligence was aware of the agreement and were pushing for it to be leaked. 'I would say that this is a relationship failure,' Mahuta said when asked if the shock leak represented an intelligence failure for Australia and New Zealand. 'That's why it's so important for the Solomons to provide a level of transparency - to ensure that we can elevate the conversations around the impact of those arrangements around regional security and regional sovereignty to the Pacific Islands Forum.' Much of the responsibility for that breakdown in relationship, however, lay at the feet of the Solomons' government, and, by extension, its prime minister, Manasseh Sogavare, she suggested. 'It would be good manners, and good protocol, to enable your neighbours to have a greater awareness and understanding of your concerns around regional security prior to entering into relationships outside the region,' she said. 'While we respect the sovereignty of the Solomons and any nation in the Pacific, we also respect our contribution towards supporting and strengthening the cohesion of the Pacific.' Mahuta added that was 'very much a New Zealand-centric view of where the relationship breakdown has occurred ... I don't want to conflate New Zealand's position with Australia's - we stand on our own two feet in relation to the way in which we work with our Pacific neighbours.' The deal raised immediate concerns from New Zealand, Australia and the United States about the prospect of a Chinese military base being built in the Solomons - and in the wider Pacific that the region could become a chessboard for geopolitical powers. Australia called the prospect of a military base a 'red line', and the US said it would 'take action' in response to any base being built. Within the Solomons, Matthew Wale, the leader of the opposition, argued it 'would make the Solomons a geopolitical playing field' and 'further threaten the nation's fragile unity'. Mahuta, however, said heated discussions of a possible military base were not helpful. 'We've got to take this one step at a time,' she said. 'The first conversation should be to understand the nature of the arrangements - because if we jump too quickly to a set of hypotheticals that aren't confirmed ... it's not going to be helpful to the kind of conversation New Zealand believes would benefit the region.' She said New Zealand had to 'take at face value' assurances from Solomon Islands that a naval base would not go ahead. 'We would be deeply concerned if the nature of these arrangements led to the militarisation of the Solomon Islands,' she said. 'We take at face value ... [the assurance] that these arrangements will not lead to the militarisation of a base in Honiara ... [although] it would be good to have something written down.'  Within the Solomons, the agreement has raised concerns that Chinese forces could be used by authorities to squash dissent and protest. A cartoon widely shared in Solomon Islands on social media shows protesters being hemmed in by an armed Xi Jinping in military garb, while Sogavare stands behind Xi, saying: 'He's protecting you from you.' Mahuta tacitly acknowledged those concerns, saying New Zealand's previous assistance during periods of unrest had been designed to assist the population broadly, rather than to benefit political elites. 'New Zealand ... when we respond to issues of unrest, like in the Solomons, our response is for all people in the Solomons, not just some people. So, again, it was a curious set of arrangements from our perspective,' she said.  Even as the security deal continues to generate headlines, however, Mahuta said the greatest threats to the Pacific and its security were climate change and the economic impact of Covid. Last week the Pacific Elders' Voice group, which includes former leaders of the Marshall Islands, Palau, Kiribati and Tuvalu, released a statement saying it was climate change, not military bases that needed the most urgent attention. 'The big conversation for the Pacific is not necessarily a security conversation, but an economic conversation because the level of economic vulnerability of the Pacific has only been compounded by Covid and will continue to be compounded by climate change,' Mahuta said. 'It's not just security issues that create instability. It's actually economic fragility. That is a challenge for the Pacific that needs to be discussed.'", "09b35a6a02251463fc5213a8c98a0208f70e93a95c79dcce7895e3c3": "Reproductive rights activists across Latin America have vowed to protect hard-fought gains in their own territories as they brace for potential ripple effects if the US supreme court overturns Roe vs Wade - the 1973 ruling which guarantees the right to abortion. Latin America has some of the most draconian anti-abortion laws in the world. But feminist movements have fought for decades to chip away at the prohibitions, and in recent years a younger, diverse generation of activists has mobilized in massive numbers to help clinch a string of victories in traditionally conservative countries. Now, the possibility that the US could be moving in the opposite direction has prompted bewilderment, fear and indignation among campaigners from Mexico to Argentina. 'The segment of society that wants to return us to the dark ages is real,' said Ana Cristina Gonzalez Velez, a Colombian doctor and co-founder of Mesa por la Vida, an organization that was part of the successful campaign for decriminalization of abortion in Colombia. 'This has to be a wake-up call, that a legal victory is not a cultural one.' A February ruling by Colombia's constitutional court - which decriminalized abortion until the 24th week of pregnancy - was the latest in a series of gains by reproductive rights activists. In 2020, Argentina's marea verde - green wave - protests pushed the country's congress to legalize elective abortion until the 14th week of pregnancy. Less than a year later, Mexico's highest court declared a complete abortion ban was unconstitutional - although statutes outlawing abortion are still on the books in most of Mexico's 32 states. Brazil - where terminations are only allowed in cases of rape, risk to the woman's life and certain congenital conditions - and Chile are also facing pivotal moments in the fight for legalization. But the importance of Roe vs Wade across the region cannot be overstated, said Debora Diniz, a Brazilian law professor and human rights activist. 'In a country that is a political, financial, military empire, a supreme court decision has a contagious effect. Because everything moves together,' said Diniz, who co-founded Anis - Institute of Bioethics, Human Rights and Gender, an NGO pushing for the court in Brazil to decriminalize elective abortion. Argentina was able to secure change through legislation, but the effort took years and has been difficult to replicate in other democracies ravaged by past military dictatorships or still governed by a patriarchal ruling class, she said. 'For Latin American countries, like Brazil, like Mexico, like Colombia, the US supreme court was a very important precedent behind the simple idea that courts are a legitimate space in which to decide abortion [rights],' said Diniz. The Mexican lawyer and abortion rights campaigner Melissa Ayala said that the courts in Mexico were strongly on the side of women's reproductive rights now. But she warned that anti-abortion groups that have been gathering forces in the region will now take a page out of the US playbook. Mariela Belski, executive director of Amnesty International Argentina, agreed. 'The threat has been there since the legalization [allowing abortion] was passed,' she said. 'We are very worried about the strong anti-rights groups that we are seeing.' Such concerns are all the more pressing because while abortion may be legal in Argentina, access still varies dramatically between regions. Women in Argentina are not prepared to cede any ground, Belski said, adding that they would flood the streets at the first sign of any fresh threat to their legal rights. Her advice to US counterparts was exactly that. 'Take to the streets. Mobilize in massive numbers,' she said, and work in a bipartisan way. 'I think that the secret in Argentina was the cross-section of legislators who were fighting for the same cause. There wasn't political division.' Added Diniz: 'We have to believe in the green wave. The situation in Latin America was so desperate, and we managed to bring about change.' In several Latin American countries the situation remains desperate: Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador maintain absolute prohibitions in all circumstances, and women have been given long prison sentences even in cases where they suffered miscarriages. In Honduras, the government responded to the growing strength of legalization campaigns by enshrining its total abortion ban in its constitution. 'Things couldn't be worse,' said Neesa Medina, a member of feminist collective Somos Muchas. It was not lost on Medina that the people most affected by an abortion ban in the United States will be the most vulnerable: minorities, migrants, the undocumented. 'Latinas,' she added. 'There are so many stories that link us as societies. It's our neighbors, our families, our cousins, aunts, who are going to feel the repercussions directly.' But activists across the region said that their own recent histories offer proof that progress can be fought for. 'We're so used to looking to the United States, but this is a very good moment to look to the south,' said Ayala.", "75ebb7172fd2ab3a333b9f7bb462b4f188f1d1ebbf212fcfd6dd8537": "", "00d9581eee6f418cd769159965735481e45670fc322ad6676231da7f": "Time to wrap up. Britain is facing the risk of stagflation after the Bank of England warned that surging energy prices will drive inflation to 10% by the end of the year as the economy stumbles. The pound plunged to its lowest since June 2020 as the BoE hiked borrowing costs to a 13-year high. Sterling has lost 2.5 cents since the start of the day, down 2%, on track for the worst day since March 2020. The BoE predicted that the economy could contract sharply in the last quarter of this year when the energy price cap is lifted, as the cost of living crisis hit household spending. Announcing its fourth rate rise in as many meetings, the BoE said: The UK economy is also expected to shrink in 2023. Although it might not be a technical recession, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey agreed that the UK faces a 'very sharp slowdown'. Experts agreed that the UK was on the brink of a recession, and that stagnation worries were rising. Here's the full story: Our economics editor Larry Elliott explains: The same energy prices which are hurting consumers drove Shell's profits to over $9bn in the first quarter of the year. Our Money team have pulled together a round-up of what today's interest rate rise mean - here's a flavour: And here's the full piece: The Bank of England's grim forecasts have piled more pressure on UK chancellor Rishi Sunak to take action. With inflation seen hitting 10%, employment rising and the economy contracting in 2023, Sunak needs to do more to help households suffering a deepening cost of living crisis. Our economics editor Larry Elliott says. Here's Larry's full analysis: The Bank of England has warned that the cost of living crisis could plunge the economy into recession this year, as it increased interest rates to tackle soaring inflation that is expected to rise above 10% in the coming months. Threadneedle Street's monetary policy committee (MPC) voted by a majority to raise its base rate from 0.75% to 1%, lifting the cost of borrowing to the highest level in 13 years, as it sounded the alarm over the risks from spiralling inflation exacerbated by Russia's war in Ukraine. Despite the growing risks to the economy as households endured one of the biggest annual declines in their income for decades, the Bank said a quarter-point rise was warranted to block persistently high inflation from taking hold, as the shock from soaring energy costs rippled through the global economy. Issuing a downbeat verdict as voters went to the polls in local elections, the Bank predicted Britain was on track for years of meagre economic growth as people cut back their spending to deal with the heavy blow to living standards. Against a backdrop of soaring international energy prices, household gas and electricity bills are expected to rise by 40% in October, after the government offset only some of last month's record rise using measures outlined in Rishi Sunak's spring statement. With the chancellor under pressure to launch a fresh support package for householders, the Bank said consumers tightening their belts to deal with the cost of living crisis was likely to push the economy into a sharp contraction in the fourth quarter. Although a modest recovery is expected at the start of next year, ensuring two consecutive quarters of falling GDP (the technical definition of a recession) is likely to be avoided, the Bank warned Britain's economy would shrink by 0.25% over the course of 2023 as a whole, in effect a slow-burn recession. The 'cost of living crisis' means the UK may be on the brink of recession, warns Steven Bell, chief economist at BMO GAM: Katharine Neiss, chief European economist at PGIM Fixed Income says there is a risk the Bank could be pushed into setting even higher rates into a recession, as a falling pound pushes up inflation. James Smith of ING sees clear hints that the Bank's MPC committee thinks that is going to be too aggressive. Newsnight's Ben Chu has produced some neat charts of the Bank's forecasts: The minutes of the Bank's meeting highlight the split among policymakers as they try to curb inflation at the risk of pushing the economy into recession. They show that 'most members of the Committee' judged that some degree of further tightening might still be appropriate in the coming months, although views differed about the balance of risks. But some members of the Committee judged that the risks around activity and inflation over the policy horizon were 'more evenly balanced and that such guidance was not appropriate at this juncture'. The pound has plunged, hitting its lowest level since June 2020, on growing fears that the UK could fall into recession. Sterling has slumped to $1.2375, down nearly nearly two and half cents today, on track for its worst day since March 2020, when the pandemic caused markets to crash. You might expect a rise in interest rates to strengthen a currency, especially as three of the nine policymakers wanted a larger, 50 basis-point rise to 1.25%.  Instead, the split at the Bank of England, the sharp cut to growth forecasts, and the prospect of even higher inflation is hurting the pound. Matthew Ryan, senior market analyst at global financial service firm, Ebury, says the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee looks more divided on policy than we've seen in some time.  Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index and FOREX.com, agrees that stagflation worries are hitting the pound: Q: You've been cautious about using the term 'stagflation' - but this is stagflation, isn't it? How worried should households be? Bailey says he avoids the term, as it doesn't have a good definition. [An economy facing double-digit inflation and the risk of a contraction doesn't sound like the worst definition, though...]  Q: What do you say to struggling households who will feel you've just given them another kick? Bailey says some people think the Bank should raise interest rates even higher. He doesn't, so policy is 'calibrated' to reflect the balance of risks. The Bank has also revised up its forecast for wage growth, he expains, saying that companies tell him they've 'really struggling' to hire staff. Q: When you say there's nothing the Bank can do to protect people from this hit, as you saying 'over to you, chancellor'? Governor Andrew Bailey says the Bank never advises government on policy, it is simply pointing out that monetary policy has its limits. Q: Is the pain that households are facing the only way to get inflation down? Is it medicine we need to take? Andrew Bailey explains that the shock to real incomes (from the surge in prices) will be the main downward driver on inflation, rather than monetary policy. The hit to incomes in the UK from surging energy and imported goods costs are 'unavoidable', warns deputy governor Ben Broadbent. Monetary policy (changing interest rates) cannot offset it, he explains.  Broadbent says the Ofgem energy cap is likely to increase by around PS1,500 during 2022 (April's rise, plus the one coming in October), on top of a PS300 increase in 2021. You can double that hit, if you add the increase in imported goods prices due to the Ukraine war. In contrast, the impact of raising interest rates on mortgage costs is a fraction, perhaps just a tenth, he adds. Onto questions: Q: Your forecasts looks very much like a recession, so how can you justify exacerbating the pressures on households and businesses in the cost of living crisis? BoE Governor Andrew Bailey says the Bank's forecast show a 'very sharp slowdown', although not a technical recession (two consecutive quarters of negative growth). Explaining today's rate rise, Bailey says the Bank is walking a very narrow path, and cites two risks.  First, the UK's very tight labour market, and the pressure on wages as firms struggle to hire staff.  Second, the question of how savings build up during the pandemic will be used. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey is holding a press conference now. He explains that inflationary pressures have 'intensified sharply' since the Ukraine war began, and that Russia's invasion has led to a material deterioration in the global economic outlook. With inflation already well over the Bank's 2% target, the risks to inflation are skewed to the upside, Bailey says. But when CPI inflation falls it will fall rapidly, he predicts.", "b59d488d1dd5454bfc859a41313e6ae5202a9469d484a8e15050e937": "", "d7ecabeb4bd6f502194df12d98d2c6829f4eb7ab102041453aa19f5a": "The colour they are clad in is an unmissable shade of fuchsia pink. They walk the streets across the Philippines, waving banners along the way and stopping anyone who will listen. Many are young or first-time voters, and some travel for hours to join campaign teams. For them, next week's election is a make-or-break moment for their country. 'I really want change,' says Mariel Ramirez, 35, a first-time voter who is among those campaigning. The impact of the pandemic on the poorest, and the prospect of the return to office of one of the country's most controversial families - the Marcoses - drove her to act. 'It's so obvious that a [Marcos] presidency would really just bring the country to its lowest point,' said Ramirez. 'They're a family who just enrich themselves.' There are just days left until more than 67 million Filipinos vote for their next president in a highly contentious election. Ferdinand Marcos Jr, known as 'Bongbong' or BBM and the son of the former dictator Ferdinand Marcos, is leading in opinion polls - despite his late father's notorious history of corruption and rights abuses. Leni Robredo and her army of nearly 2 million volunteers, known as Kakampinks (pink allies), are trying to stop Macros Jr. Robredo, a human rights lawyer who has advocated for disadvantaged groups and is the current vice-president, is trailing second in the polls by a significant margin. In an election where online misinformation is rife, her supporters have launched a door-to-door effort that is unusual in its scale. In Sampaloc, a deprived district of Manila, some residents are receptive. Josie Loyola, 70, who sits outside her house in the morning sunshine, smiles as she spots the campaigners passing by. 'She is good-hearted, she has a lot of accomplishments,' Loyola says of Robredo. But she lowers her voice when she speaks of Marcos Jr: '[He] is really questionable, he has questionable integrity.' She worries about political instability, or a repeat of martial law, which was imposed by Marcos Sr in 1972. Human rights violations were rife during the nine-year period of martial law: 3,240 people were killed, while tens of thousands more were tortured and imprisoned, according to Amnesty International. Loyola's son, who is crouched beside a tub of soapy water, stays focused on scrubbing his motorbike. He is undecided, he says. Not everyone wants to talk. A few doors down, images of a smiling Marcos Jr, holding his hand in a peace sign, are plastered on to a house. It was 36 years ago that the People Power revolution brought an end to Marcoses' 20-year rule, forcing the family to flee into exile. They fled by helicopter, stashing onboard items worth $15m (PS12m) including gold bars, freshly printed cash and hundreds of pieces of jewellery. It was small change compared with the overall estimates of the family's ill-gotten wealth. Some suggest as much as PS8bn was plundered by the family. Marcos Sr died in1989, but the rest of the family was allowed to return to the Philippines in the 1990s and it has been slowly rebranding itself ever since. 'Our democratic transition did not go through a process of transitional justice - unlike other countries that went through political or civil strife,' says Julio Teehankee, professor of political science and international studies at De La Salle University in Manila. Instead, the Marcoses were given a warm reception by the powerful, says Teehankee. 'The society elites, the circles, embraced them and treated them as celebrities.' The family began to re-establish their position in politics and cement allegiances. In 2016, Marcos Sr was given a hero's burial with military honours on the recommendation of President Rodrigo Duterte. Marcos survivors were appalled and warned history was being whitewashed. Duterte's daughter Sara is Marcos Jr's running mate. Observers say the failure of the Philippine education system to properly discuss the reality of the Marcos rule has created a gap in public knowledge, especially among younger generations, which the Marcos Jr's camp has exploited. Online, social media accounts linked to or supportive of the Marcoses downplay the dictatorship and seek to justify or even deny past abuses by spreading misinformation.  They present the Marcos years as a golden era: a time when the economy was thriving; when infrastructure was developed; and there was peace and order. The human rights abuses and kleptocracy are swept aside. Celica Inductivo, 35, who lives across from Loyola, stands over a simmering pot, preparing lunch for her family, as volunteers pass. She will vote for Marcos Jr, she says. During martial law, if you were a decent citizen, you did not have anything to be afraid of, her mother, who was a volunteer for Marcos Sr, told her. Inductivo does not believe his son is corrupt, and admires him for rising above such comments. 'Despite the various criticisms against BBM, like [the claim he is a] thief, he doesn't fight back,' she says, using the now popular abbreviation for Bongbong Marcos. He has been criticised for failing to attend presidential debates, and for dodging awkward media questions, including over his failure to pay a tax bill that, according to local reports, could amount to more than PS3.1bn. Marcos Jr, whose slogan is 'together we shall rise again', has stuck to a simple campaign message of unity and rekindling a former greatness.  'That's one of the greatest ironies in this year's election. The most divisive and polarising political brand in the country's history has appropriated the message of unity and hope,' says Teehankee. It is perhaps a message that is easier to sell. 'Authoritarian nostalgia is very simplistic. If you are quite frustrated and desperate, then it's easy to believe in this rather than Robredo campaign discourse of Filipinos owning the problems of the country, and helping her find solutions for it,' adds Jean Encinas Franco, an associate professor of political science at the University of the Philippines. Polling released by Pulse Asia suggests 56% of voters would pick Marcos Jr as president, and he remains the most popular candidate among all age groups. Yet Franco believes Robredo's campaign, and the large army of supporters it has attracted, will have a lasting impact on Philippine politics regardless of the election outcome. She points not only to Robredo's impassioned volunteers, but also to impressive turnouts of voters at her rallies. The atmosphere at such gatherings is festive, youthful and hopeful, Franco adds. 'I have never seen these kind of rallies or this kind of support for any kind of politician since I started voting,' she says.  'There is now a critical mass of people. Whoever the president will be, he or she will have to contend with this portion of Filipinos who are actively engaged.'For Ramirez, who has taken part in two house-to-house campaigns, and attended three rallies, she believes every possible vote counts.  The election could, she says, either steer the Philippines forward, or 'pull us further backwards and plunge the country down to a state of hopelessness and massive corruption'. Whatever happens next week, she says she will no longer be silent about politics. 'We have so much to lose this time around.'", "91f8f86f68ccd5f6bfbc1074cade3e9f06c2ae80f6e60f60614c55a9": "The online activities of the Australian white supremacist who opened fire on two New Zealand mosques - and how much of a role social media and internet platforms played in his radicalisation - will form part of a coroner's inquiry into the deaths of 51 Muslim worshipers in the 2019 Christchurch terrorist attack. But the presiding coroner, Brigitte Windley, who announced the scope of her inquiry in a decision released on Thursday, has warned of 'monumental hurdles' to exploring the terrorist's online activities - including Brenton Tarrant's attempts to wipe parts of his digital footprint before committing the attacks. The 15 March 2019 attack was planned for an online audience; the gunman streamed live footage and posted a manifesto online before he shot dozens of people at two mosques during Friday prayers. Windley's decision to include the terrorist's online activity in her investigation of what factors caused the deaths was welcomed by some Muslim groups, who had asked her at a preliminary hearing in February to examine the influence of social and digital media platforms. 'This is a landmark moment for the accountability of digital platforms,' said Aliya Danzeisen, the national coordinator of the Islamic Women's Council of New Zealand. She added that the coroner had 'opened the door to investigating the responsibility' of online platforms in the radicalisation of Tarrant and others. Many of the bereaved families had earlier decried the government's decision to exclude the actions of private companies - including online platforms - from the royal commission into the attacks, which published its report in December 2020. Windley said she would focus on Tarrant's online activities between 2014 and 2017, during which he travelled the world extensively, and before he moved to New Zealand from Australia and began planning the attack in earnest. It was a window not covered by earlier investigations, she said. It is known that Tarrant spent particular time on YouTube and the message boards 4chan and 8chan. But the coroner said she would not scrutinise the actions taken by online platforms to monitor their users for extremist content unless her inquiry uncovered evidence that Tarrant's online activities were a significant cause of his radicalisation. His 'psychological makeup' and 'upbringing in provincial New South Wales' were among other factors, she said. Windley has ordered Tarrant to divulge the location of a hard drive missing from his Dunedin flat after the attacks, and whether information on it was uploaded to cloud-based storage. The gunman was sentenced in August 2020 to life in prison without the chance of parole after pleading guilty to 51 counts of murder, 40 of attempted murder and a terrorism charge. Tarrant's guilty plea, which averted a criminal trial, meant the evidence against him was never heard, and the royal commission was conducted entirely behind closed doors. In a report of more than 800 pages, it concluded that while New Zealand's counter-terrorism agencies had focused on Islamist terror threats to the exclusion of other ideologies, Tarrant's attack could not have been prevented 'except by chance'. Some families bereaved in the massacre, New Zealand's worst modern-day mass killing, have over the past three years raised what they say are lingering questions about whether their relatives' deaths could have been prevented - either in the lead-up to or immediate aftermath of the attack. For many, the lack of access to material investigators had relied upon - some of which will now be provided to them as part of the coronial inquiry - has prompted distrust in official conclusions about the case. In her 99-page decision outlining the inquiry's scope, Windley acknowledged the 'information void' to date for the bereaved families and survivors, but stopped short of expanding her inquiry to cover everything they had asked her to investigate. It will include: A public inquest would be held into the emergency response to the attacks, Windley said. She had not yet determined whether any other part of her inquiry would be heard publicly. An inquest date has yet to be scheduled. The inquiry's timeframe is unknown.", "3d17f037577a5d338903b337f236dc554bd48a25d902f84939e1c31e": "Sweden has received assurances from the US that it would receive support during the period a potential application to join Nato is processed by the 30 nations in the alliance, foreign minister Ann Linde said in Washington on Wednesday. Sweden and neighbour Finland stayed out of Nato during the cold war, but Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its invasion of Ukraine have led the countries to rethink their security policies, with Nato membership looking increasingly likely. Both countries are concerned they would be vulnerable during an application process, which could take up to a year to be approved by all Nato's members. 'Naturally, I'm not going to go into any details, but I feel very sure that now we have an American assurance,' Linde told Swedish TV from Washington after meeting US secretary of state Antony Blinken. 'However, not concrete security guarantees, those you can only get if you are a full member of Nato,' she added. Linde declined to say what assurances she had received from Blinken. 'They would mean that Russia can be clear that if they direct any kind of negative activities against Sweden, which they have threatened, it would not be something that the US would just allow to happen ... without a response,' she said. Sweden's defence minister said last month that an application could trigger a number of responses from Russia, including cyber-attacks and hybrid measures - like propaganda campaigns - to undermine Sweden's security. Moscow has warned it could deploy nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles in the European exclave of Kaliningrad if Sweden and Finland become Nato members. Linde, who will now travel to Canada to discuss security matters with its government, said the US was strongly supportive of Swedish and Finnish membership in Nato, which would increase stability in the Baltic and Arctic regions. Both Sweden and Finland are expected to make a decision about whether to apply to join Nato this month.

The Salem-based group on Tuesday tweeted a copy of its request to raise a flag to mark what it termed Satanic Appreciation Week, from 23 to 29 July. The application filed online with the city's property management department does not provide any details about what the flag would look like or what the weeklong event entails. Spokespersons for the Satanic Temple did not respond to an email seeking comment on Wednesday. The group has lodged freedom of religion challenges nationwide, including a recent federal lawsuit arguing the Boston city council's traditional opening prayer at its public meetings is discriminatory and unconstitutional. The office of Boston's mayor, Michelle Wu, declined to comment on the group's request other than to say it was reviewing the supreme court's decision while also evaluating its flag-raising program. The supreme court ruled unanimously on Monday that Boston discriminated against activist Harold Shurtleff because of his 'religious viewpoint', even though it had routinely approved other flag raising requests. In 2017, Shurtleff and his Camp Constitution campaign group wanted to fly a white banner with a red cross on a blue background called the Christian flag to mark Constitution Day on 17 September.", "3021c1f73d962328672b9f15e3db087c6823b88d0689aa5886a257d3": "", "ec6c7abab654c5bffe179407a380a12f23c602217a5ac9ef9d320c76": "", "36080192c72a27b65bc08b0dd6845b2f8ae09be29a67399e417dfac9": "", "e8e35ea69d37fc28238aa7ce26a6e2fa18860ef416268a5a7fcc4cfc": "", "821179b1dfe3762074a213b1cf18acb5a5a1de52f70ac257f1f555e1": "", "bcee7582be611ab16e8217c5a95c2ffeb1ecac27373956e9680559a7": "", "4a362622b16553955a18b916cb964e4d4b4d0336bc910b476b127fe2": "", "eaf962a00f6eefd316794ae6327516b3a67eb14dfafd2748d5abd926": "", "1a00c07320e7a64eb8a6ff4e5538578f0b960f8c4917bc379e481458": "", "222c704cb5d5bdae62cbee6e7de34d6bb238791987f06a1960b6e02b": "'I'm very pro-choice.' So said Donald Trump in an interview on NBC's Meet the Press in 1999, attributing his views on abortion to 'a little bit of a New York background'. Two decades later, the businessman and reality TV star is the unlikeliest of heroes for social conservatives and Christian evangelicals because he delivered the ultimate prize: the end of America's constitutional right to abortion. The leak this week of a draft supreme court opinion showing that the court's conservative majority is poised to overturn Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 decision legalising abortion, represented a vivid aftershock of the Trump presidency. He had reversed his position on the issue by the time he reached the White House and, with uncharacteristic discipline, spent his four years in office bending the federal judiciary to the right, including with three supreme court appointments. 'The supreme court will be his most important and long-lasting political legacy,' said Amanda Hollis-Brusky, an associate professor of politics at Pomona College in Claremont, California. 'If the number of supreme court justices stays at nine, Trump will have appointed a third of the supreme court having been a one-term president who lost the popular vote by 3 million. And yet those justices will have a greater and a longer-lasting impact than anything else he did as president.' The threat he posed to reproductive rights was always hiding in plain sight. As a Republican candidate running for president in 2016, Trump released a list of 11 potential supreme court nominees after heeding advice from conservative groups such as the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation. The unusual move was seen as a way of reassuring conservatives troubled by his boorish behaviour and past views on issues such as abortion. Then, during the last presidential debate with his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, Trump was asked if he wanted to see the supreme court overturn Roe v Wade. He replied: 'Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justices on, that's really what's going to be - that will happen. And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court. I will say this: it will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.' Once in office, Trump followed through by appointing Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett to the highest court, handing conservatives a 6-3 majority. In all he appointed 234 judges, including 54 appellate judges, outpacing Barack Obama's first-term total of 172 and George W Bush's 204. The process was guided by two men: Mitch McConnell, then Republican majority leader in the Senate, and Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society, which counts among its members four supreme court justices, dozens of federal judges and every Republican attorney general since it was created in 1982. Hollis-Brusky, author of Ideas with Consequences: The Federalist Society and the Conservative Counterrevolution, said: 'One of the interesting things about Trump, McConnell, Leonard Leo and the Federalist Society is that Trump made appointments based on friendships, brought his buddies into the administration, had loyalty tests for his appointees and fired people who displeased him but, when it came to the operation of finding, selecting and confirming judges, it was a completely professionalised shop. 'If anyone worked in lockstep, it was McConnell and Leo, and Trump just largely got out of the way.' Trump gained further kudos in the eyes of conservatives when he resisted calls to withdraw his nomination of Kavanaugh, who was accused of having committed sexual assault as a teenager. The president also moved swiftly to replace the late justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg despite pressure to wait for the 2020 election. Curt Levey, president of the conservative advocacy group the Committee for Justice, said: 'He showed some backbone that I'm not sure other Republican presidents would have shown. He stuck by Kavanaugh when frankly there were Republicans on the Hill who did not want him to. 'When people said, 'Oh, you can't nominate anyone to fill Ginsburg's seat, it's too close to the election,' he said, 'I disagree'. He showed courage. Whether you like the guy or hate the guy, he was known for the courage of his convictions.' When the draft opinion leaked to the Politico website on Monday, Democrats expressed outrage while most Republicans focused on the breach of court secrecy, perhaps aware that premature triumphalism could result in political backlash. But Madison Cawthorn, a Republican congressman from North Carolina, wrote on Twitter that the ex-president deserved the credit. Others may eventually follow suit in praising Trump for delivering on his campaign promises and succeeding where other Republican presidents failed. Michael D'Antonio, a political commentator and Trump biographer, said: 'They will regard him as heroic. He'll be the fallen man who redeemed himself by this advocacy and forevermore he'll be worshipped in certain corners of the Christian right. Their fanaticism knows no bounds and they've been looking for this kind of person to come along forever. What's ironic is that he's proving that a profane man can accomplish what devout ones could not.' If Roe v Wade falls, about half of the states in the US are certain or likely to ban abortion. The political impact on November's midterm elections remains uncertain. But such an outcome could give Trump a ready-made applause line at campaign rallies for a White House bid in 2024. Edward Fallone, an associate professor at Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, said: 'It increases the likelihood Trump will run again because he'll see this as a monumental issue for generating enthusiasm and turnout. If he was hesitating at all to run a second time, I would think now he's going to feel a bit emboldened. 'I cannot imagine a scenario where Donald Trump does not take credit for this and repeat endlessly that he alone made it happen.' Fallone added: 'Seismic events like Roe versus Wade on the way to being overturned have all kinds of ancillary repercussions. I'm worrying about the legal landscape and the future of constitutional law but the entire political landscape and the leadership of the Republican party could also be impacted. 'This is an earthquake and it's going to have repercussions.'", "766abeb6d77f1d68204018b718b3d9fb685b83afa57b8c8d90d39dab": "Aubrey, a 26-year-old in Florida, does not recommend working at a hotel in the middle of a pandemic. The floors were constantly understaffed and inventory seemed to disappear overnight. In fact, Aubrey was genuinely relieved when she was finally laid off. And like so many newly occupation-free members of the American workforce, Aubrey turned to the internet and searched for any sort of minimal-effort side-hustle that seemed feasible. Aubrey found hope with what she describes as 'low-content books'. With just a layperson's grasp of graphic design, Aubrey was able to flood the Amazon marketplace with a tide of scholastic notebooks, graph-paper pamphlets and crossword collections. There is no real writing involved in the low-content book scheme, which is exactly the point. All Aubrey needs to do is come up with an appetizing front cover and trust that the shadowy algorithm takes care of business. 'My most successful product is randomly a 'vegetable' blank lined notebook where I just scattered some pictures of cartoonish onions, pumpkins and leeks on the cover,' she tells me. 'It has done pretty well and is about $200 of my sales.' Aubrey isn't breaking the bank, but she's emblematic of a growing contingency in the global economy that's lured by the hope of cobbling together 'passive income' streams online. More than 47 million people quit their jobs last year, leaving many to exchange their long-term career ambitions with low-stakes schemes to make money from home. Interest in the r/passive_income subreddit, where users swap tips on earning extra cash, skyrocketed throughout the pandemic, while Google search inquiries on 'passive income' have more than doubled since March 2020. And more people are now making money through unconventional means - the number of self-employed people who reported 'unincorporated' work (meaning they weren't tied to a specific company) has gone up from 8.8m in March 2020 to 9.3m in March 2022, according to the Department of Labor. There's a genuine reorientation in the nation's labor philosophy, and it seems to grow more fervent with each passing day. 'As a result of the pandemic, most people realized that a seemingly safe job or industry can change overnight, and we really can't predict those circumstances,' says Dorie Clark, a professor at Duke's Fuqua School of Business and the author of Entrepreneurial You. 'The best security comes from having multiple income streams and diversification. When we can't know the future, you need to place multiple bets.' Nobody should take a get-rich-quick scheme at face value, but it's not hard to understand why Americans were more motivated than ever to wrest control of their own financial fate. We all spent 2020 simultaneously bored and terrified as the economy tanked and the contagion spread. Many of us found ourselves out of a paycheck, and more importantly, reconsidering our foundational conceptions of work. Trauma and clarity are congenitally entwined, and after a year stuck at home, disgruntled employees wondered aloud if they were truly happy returning to a life of clocking in and out. It's not that Aubrey particularly relishes her low-content book ruse, but at the very least, it doesn't make her hate her life. 'The pandemic was almost a blessing in disguise because I was ready to work at that hotel for the rest of my life,' she says. It's enticing to believe that your savings account could swell by the turning gears of idle clicks. Yes, it's possible; the pandemic has transformed some career nine-to-fivers into overnight barons. Just ask Kat Norton, a 28-year-old in Long Island, who was condemned to her home in 2020 after her consulting job restricted travel in accordance with the lockdowns. Norton suddenly had a lot of time on her hands, so she started uploading quirky Excel tutorials on TikTok. Those videos went viral, and within months Norton quit her job to create a platform called 'Miss Excel' - where she creates tutorials for the whole Microsoft Office suite. Norton tells me she works about 20 hours a week, and that her business is now worth over $1m. Everything fell into its right place. 'The pandemic was a massive pattern disruptor,' she says. 'A lot of times your day job feels a lot less glamorous when we're working from home. Travel was the fun part of my job. When I was whipping out securitizations from my childhood bedroom I was like, 'Dang.'' Norton took full advantage of her newfound liberty. She and her boyfriend roamed the country as digital nomads, renting a house for a spell in Hawaii or California every few months, living the good life. (Norton has since bought a permanent home in Colorado.) It's an incredible success story and also a total outlier from the mean, but that hasn't stopped a tide of charlatans willing to sell their guarded secrets of passive income salvation, as if anyone can immediately start raking in easy revenue if they simply know what buttons to push. It's a tale as old as time. In 2019, Alana Semuels covered a story for the Atlantic about a New York couple who bought a $3,999 training course from the e-commerce partnership of Matt Behdjou and Mike Gazzola, two of the more famous gurus in the passive income universe at the time. The course promised to teach them how to resell items imported from China at a massive profit through Amazon. But the products were difficult to distribute at scale, and the couple quickly found themselves $40,000 underwater. The fantasies of financial freedom through ambient gains revealed themselves to be laughably counterfeit, all engineered by a pair of scammers who left their clients holding the bag. (Behdjou and Gazzola were eventually sued by Amazon.) 'It may seem obvious to an outsider that most people aren't going to become rich by selling things on Amazon,' wrote Semuels. 'But that's the thing about gold rushes: Some people do find gold, and it is sometimes hard to tell what distinguishes the people who make it from those who don't.' Indeed, it's easy to fall into this trap the deeper you delve into the passive income universe. YouTube is littered with young influencers promoting their financial wisdom - usually conjoined with questionably optimistic thumbnails. '9 Passive Income Ideas, how I make $27,000 per week,' reads one, uploaded by one prominent advice-giver named Ali Abdaal. One of the ideas he mentions? Selling classes online. Abdaal uses one of his recent webinars as an example: It's titled 'Starting a Successful Side Hustle'. Effectively, Abdaal is telling his viewers that an effective way to harvest cash out of the ether is to teach others to do the same; an ouroboros that proves just how flimsy the precepts of passive income can be. But many people who entered this ecosystem during the pandemic are charting a far more realistic future. Brett Parsons, a 41-year-old dad in the Bay Area, simply wanted an outlet that melded his pecuniary and emotional interests. He's a longtime tabletop gaming hobbyist, and enjoys painting miniature plastic soldiers that add up to Warhammer armies. As the world ground to a halt, and his full-time career was left in stasis, Parsons started selling his models on eBay. Covid proved that there didn't need to be a discernible difference between what he did for work and what he did for fun. 'I realized I could use the extra income to pay rent, and to support that by selling an army would be great. I sold my first army for 400 or 500 bucks,' says Parsons. 'It's almost like I'm getting paid to do therapy ... It relieves stress for me and makes money at the same time.'", "76ae73170b927667e4433c590553f1d583a2d7b77b4b0f26b59f32bf": "", "2f5071656c8b44add7e1766b7e231356998167472378856f6fc81dc7": "With Roe v Wade on the brink of defeat, following the leak of a supreme court opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito and signed by four other conservative judges, the court's views - and track record - on abortion are under extreme scrutiny. Here's what the nine justices have actually said over the years about it. Roberts voted for abortion restrictions in two major cases: in 2007, to uphold a ban on what opponents call 'partial-birth abortion', and in dissent in 2016, when the court struck down Texas restrictions on abortion clinics. But when a virtually identical law from Louisiana came before the court in 2020, Roberts voted against it - and wrote the opinion striking it down, insisting the 2016 case 'was wrongly decided' but that the question nevertheless was 'whether to adhere to it' in deciding the 2020 case. Roberts' views on when to break with court precedent could determine how far he is willing to go in the Mississippi case. At his 2005 confirmation hearing, he said overturning precedent 'is a jolt to the legal system', which depends in part on stability and evenhandedness. Merely thinking that an earlier case was wrongly decided is not enough to overturn it, he said - it requires looking 'at these other factors, like settled expectations, like the legitimacy of the court, like whether a particular precedent is workable or not, whether a precedent has been eroded by subsequent developments'. Thomas has repeatedly called for Roe to be overturned, and voted to do so in 1992 when he was a dissenter in Planned Parenthood v Casey. In 2000, he wrote of Roe: 'Abortion is a unique act, in which a woman's exercise of control over her own body ends, depending on one's view, human life or potential human life. 'Nothing in our federal constitution deprives the people of this country of the right to determine whether the consequences of abortion to the fetus and to society outweigh the burden of an unwanted pregnancy on the mother. Although a state may permit abortion, nothing in the constitution dictates that a state must do so.' Breyer, who announced his retriement earlier this year and will be replaced by Ketanji Brown Jackson (whose own record 'offers few clues' as to how she'll lean on abortion cases), led the two supreme court majorities in defense of abortion rights, in 2000 and 2016, though he has acknowledged the controversy over abortion. Millions of Americans believe 'that an abortion is akin to causing the death of an innocent child', he has said, while millions of others 'fear that a law that forbids abortion would condemn many American women to lives that lack dignity'. Still, Breyer wrote, because the constitution guarantees 'fundamental individual liberty', and because it has to govern even when there are strong divisions in the country, 'this court, in the course of a generation, has determined and then redetermined that the constitution offers basic protection to the woman's right to choose.' Alito, who wrote the majority opinion in the leaked draft, has a long track record of opposing abortion rights. He voted to uphold every abortion law the supreme court has considered since his 2006 confirmation. Before, as a federal appeals court judge, he voted to uphold a series of Pennsylvania abortion restrictions, including requiring a woman to notify her spouse before obtaining an abortion. The supreme court ultimately struck down that notification rule in Casey and reaffirmed the abortion right in 1992 by a 5-4 vote. In 1985, while working for the Reagan administration, Alito wrote that the government should say publicly in a pending abortion case 'that we disagree with Roe v Wade'. He also noted he was 'particularly proud' of his work arguing 'that the constitution does not protect a right to an abortion'. Sotomayor joined the court in 2009 with virtually no record on abortion issues, but has voted repeatedly in favor of abortion rights since then. Recently, when the court allowed Texas's restrictive abortion law to take effect, Sotomayor accused her colleagues of burying 'their heads in the sand'. Her displeasure with the court's recent Texas ruling was evident at a virtual appearance she made. 'I can't change Texas's law, but you can,' she said. Kagan also has repeatedly voted in favor of abortion rights in more than 11 years as a justice. She is also arguably the most consistent voice on the court arguing for the importance of adhering to precedents. She called Texas's new abortion law 'patently unconstitutional' and a 'clear, and indeed undisputed, conflict with Roe and Casey'. Kagan had already grappled with the issue of abortion before becoming a justice. While working in the Clinton White House she was the co-author of a memo that urged the president for political reasons to support a late-term abortion ban proposed by Republicans in Congress, so long as it contained an exception for the health of the woman. Ultimately, George W Bush signed a similar late-term abortion ban without a health exception. The supreme court upheld it. Gorsuch has perhaps the shortest record on abortion among the nine justices. He was in the majority allowing Texas's restrictive abortion law to take effect. In dissent in 2020, he would have upheld Louisiana's abortion clinic restrictions. But Gorsuch insisted at his Senate confirmation hearing that he was concerned about procedural issues, not the subject matter. 'I do not care if the case is about abortion or widgets or anything else,' he said. Trump named Kavanaugh to the supreme court shortly after he sided with the administration in a 2017 case involving abortion. He later dissented from the Louisiana decision, and voted to allow the new Texas law to take effect, though he has taken a less absolutist stance than some of his conservative colleagues. In the Louisiana case, for example, Kavanaugh wrote that more information was needed about how the state's restrictions on clinics would affect doctors who provide abortions; and although he voted to allow the Texas law to go into effect, during oral arguments he appeared to have doubts about its novel structure and whether it would lead to a spate of copycat laws, both on abortion and other rights protected by the constitution. Barrett has a long record of personal opposition to abortion rights, co-authoring a 1998 law review article that said abortion is 'always immoral'. Her one public vote on the supreme court concerning abortion was to allow the Texas 'fetal heartbeat' law to take effect, though she joined Kavanaugh in raising skeptical questions about its structure. She also cast two votes as an appeals court judge to reconsider rulings that blocked Indiana abortion restrictions. In 2016, before Trump's election victory, she spoke about how she thought abortion law might change if Trump had the chance to appoint justices. 'Roe's core holding that, you know, women have a right to an abortion - I don't think that would change,' said Barrett, then a Notre Dame law professor. She said limits on what she called 'very late-term abortions' and restrictions on abortion clinics would be more likely to be upheld.", "362ba06daca285fba0713bc561ce44a802c217c99b0b2eeea81af746": "Their bunker couldn't withstand a direct hit from ferocious Russian bombardment, food was running out and finding water could get them killed. For some civilians inside the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, it was an ordeal that finally ended on Tuesday when more than 100 managed to reach the safety of a shopping centre car park in Ukrainian-held Zaporizhzhia. Some members of the group told of their experiences over the past few weeks in the besieged plant. They had survived in tunnels below the steelworks among Ukrainian troops, having to pick bomb-shattered glass from their food and hoping for rescue. 'Under permanent fire, sleeping on improvised mats, being pounded by the blast waves, running with your son and being knocked to the ground by an explosion - everything was horrible,' said evacuee Anna Zaitseva. She carried her six-month-old baby in her arms and cried when expressing her gratitude to everyone from the troops who found formula for her child to the urgent international rescue effort that got them to safety. 'Thank you,' she said, before being escorted to a private area inside the shopping centre. The group of about 100 civilians who became trapped in their refuges beneath the steelworks were granted passage in an agreement worked out with the invading Russian forces, and which took days to carry out as the world watched. Yet Ukrainian officials noted that some civilians had been left behind during the operation, prompting fresh concerns for their fate after Kyiv announced that Russian forces had launched an offensive with tanks and armoured vehicles at the site. Stretching over 11 square kilometres (4.2 square miles), the Azovstal complex is a sprawling warren of rail lines, warehouses, coal furnaces, factories, chimneys and tunnels seen as ideal for guerrilla warfare. The terror of her time at the steelworks was fresh for Elina Tsybulchenko, 54, who used to work at the site doing quality control. Tsybulchenko sought shelter there after shelling destroyed her home and water was running short in the city, yet even getting water inside the plant carried immense risks. 'They bombed like every second ... everything was shaking. Dogs barked and children screamed,' she said. 'But the hardest moment was when we were told our bunker would not survive a direct hit. 'We understood that it would just be a mass grave and no one could save us under fire,' she added. 'It would be impossible to save us. 'You can't imagine how scary it is when you sit in the shelter, in a wet and damp basement which is bouncing, shaking,' she said from Zaporizhzhia, about 230km north-west of Mariupol. 'We were praying to god that missiles fly over our shelter, because if it hit the shelter, all of us would be done.' In Zaporizhzhia, evacuees made their way from the buses into a tent offering hot food. Inside, mothers fed small children. Zaitseva said it had been hard to find basics for survival in Azovstal. 'To find water we had to move between buildings. The men did that for us, including my dad,' she said. 'He was wounded but thank god it wasn't fatal.' She said Ukrainian troops located formula for her infant son, and when that ran out, they came up with semolina that she cooked over candles. 'Raising a child is a difficult thing,' she added, noting about 70 people were sheltering in the same place as her. 'It's even harder in a bunker with no light.' Mariupol is among the most battered cities in Ukraine, and the Azovstal site is where Kyiv's troops have managed to hold out against Russian forces. The risk to civilians has been repeatedly decried, with accusations that Moscow has done little to protect people from its strikes. 'We personally tried to evacuate three times. One time everyone went out and shooting started. The truce was broken,' Zaitseva said. 'And, of course, after that, we were very wary. We thought we had been left behind. But in the end, that turned out not to be true.' At a reception centre in Zaporizhzhia, stretchers and wheelchairs were lined up, and children's shoes and toys awaited the convoy. Medical and psychological teams were on standby. Some of the elderly evacuees appeared exhausted as they arrived. 'I'm very glad to be on Ukrainian soil,' said a woman who gave only her first name, Anna, and arrived with two children, ages one and nine. 'We thought we wouldn't get out of there.'

Ukraine has regained control over several settlements surrounding Mykolayiv and Kherson in the country's south, military officials have said. Due to the successful actions of Ukrainian defenders, Russian forces 'lost control over several settlements on the border of Mykolayiv and Kherson regions,' the latest intelligence report from Ukraine's general staff of the armed forces reads.  However, heavy fighting continues in Mariupol where Russian occupiers are focusing their efforts on blocking and trying to destroy Ukrainians units stationed in the Azovstal steel works area, officials added.

Foreign secretary Liz Truss said:  Of the 45m, 15m will go to the UN Ukraine Humanitarian Fund which distributes food, water, shelter and other basic necessities, as well as working to prevent sexual violence, the agency added. Martin Griffiths, UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief co-ordinator, said: 'This generous contribution from the United Kingdom will enable the UN's Ukraine Humanitarian Fund to scale up the delivery of fast, effective and lifesaving aid to people who are caught up in this unfolding nightmare.' Another 15m will go to children's agency Unicef to provide food to pregnant women and mental health support for children. Aid organisations in Moldova and other neighbouring countries will receive 10m to protect those fleeing the war, while 5m will go to the International Federation of the Red Cross in Ukraine. Truss also announced the UK will send more medical supplies, in addition to more than 5m items already delivered, including some 380,000 packs of medicine and wound care packs to treat 220,000 wounded. Britain has already committed 2m of food supplies to parts of Ukraine encircled by Russian forces, with 17 trucks already having delivered more than 50,000kg of pasta, 10,000kg of rice, 60,000 tins of corned beef and more than 80,000 litres of water. Some 30 million in humanitarian support is going to Poland to help refugees there and get supplies into Ukraine.Nearly 16 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance within Ukraine, according to the UN. Some seven million are internally displaced, while 5.5 million refugees have spilled into neighbouring countries. Satellite images captured on Wednesday show signs of intense bombardment at the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol.  A memorial service for Ukrainian serviceman Ruslan Borovyk, who was killed in battle amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Kyiv, was carried out at Mikhailovsky Zlatoverkhy Cathedral in central Kyiv on Wednesday. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has condemned Russia's entry ban on Japanese officials as 'completely unacceptable.' 'Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a clear violation of international law and the killing of a large number of innocent civilians is a serious violation of international humanitarian law and a war crime,' Kishida told reporters during a state visit to Rome on Wednesday. 'It is the Russian side that has resorted to military means and caused this situation. The Russian side is entirely responsible for the breakdown of Japan-Russia relations.' Russia 'indefinitely' banned 63 Japanese citizens, including Kishida, from entering the country, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti earlier reported. A Russian army helicopter violated Finland's airspace on Wednesday, the Finnish defence ministry said, as the country mulls a potential Nato membership bid. 'The aircraft type is a Mi-17 helicopter and the depth of the suspected violation is about four to five kilometres', a ministry spokesman told AFP. The incident occurred on Wednesday at 10:40am (7:40 GMT). This is the second Russian airspace violation this year, following a previous one in April, both of them coming in the wake of the war in Ukraine. A civilian transport plane belonging to the Russian army briefly entered Finnish airspace on April 8. Experts have warned that Finland and Sweden would likely be subjected to Russian acts of interference as they consider whether to join Nato as a deterrent against aggression from their eastern neighbour. A Ukrainian journalist who enlisted to fight after the Russian invasion has been killed outside the north-eastern city of Izyum, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday. Oleksandr Makhov, 36, is at least the eighth journalist to have died in more than two months of conflict. Makhov, known for graphic accounts from conflict zones, had also reported from Antarctica. He fought in a 2014 conflict after Russian-speakers staged separatist insurrections in two eastern regions of Ukraine. 'Patriotic and sincere, and always without vanity. And he was always among the bravest, among those first in line,' Zelenskiy said in an early morning video address. 'From the first day of the full-scale war, he was on the frontline. Volunteer. ATO veteran. Warrior of the 95th assault brigade.' The United States has provided intelligence that has helped Ukrainian forces kill many of the Russian generals who have died in the Ukraine war, the New York Times reported on Wednesday, citing senior US officials. The targeting help is part of a classified effort by the Biden administration to provide real-time battlefield intelligence to Ukraine, the newspaper said. Washington has reportedly provided to Ukraine details on Russia's expected troop movements and the location and other details about Russia's mobile military headquarters, and Ukraine has combined that help with its own intelligence to conduct artillery strikes and other attacks that have killed Russian officers. Intelligence also includes anticipated Russian troop movements gleaned from recent American assessments of Moscow's secret battle plan for the fighting in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, the officials said.  Ukrainian officials said they have killed about 12 Russian generals on the battlefield, according to the New York Times. Officials declined to specify how many generals had been killed as a result of US assistance, the newspaper added. French President Emmanuel Macron welcomed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Paris for talks and a 'working dinner' on Wednesday evening, where Macron hoped to 'emphasise the consequences of the war for the international order well beyond the European Union, including in Asia,' his office said ahead of the talks. France wants to 'help the Indians diversify their supply' away from Russian arms and energy, officials added, according to a report from AFP. The aim 'is not to leave the Indians with no way out, but to offer solutions,' they said. After meeting German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin on Monday as part of a European tour, Modi told reporters that 'there won't be any winners in this war and everyone will lose'. India has so far avoided condemning the Russian invasion or voting to censure Moscow at the United Nations. The Elysee said Macron has an 'extremely warm relationship' with Modi, who has visited France three times since 2017, while the French leader went to India in 2018. France has a 'trusting relationship with India,' officials added, and hopes to build up the two countries' 'strategic partnership' in the Indo-Pacific. Russia continues to hit non-military targets in Ukraine such as residential properties and transport hubs in a bid to weaken the country's resolve, Britain's defence ministry has said. Despite Russian ground operations focusing on eastern Ukraine, missile strikes continue across the country as Russia attempts to hamper Ukrainian resupply efforts, the report added. Here are some of the latest images to come out of Ukraine today.  Russia has said its forces practised simulated nuclear-capable missile strikes in the western enclave of Kaliningrad, sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania along the Baltic Coast. Russia practised simulated 'electronic launches' of nuclear-capable Iskander mobile ballistic missile systems on Wednesday, the defence ministry said in a statement. The Russian forces practised single and multiple strikes at targets imitating launchers of missile systems, airfields, protected infrastructure, military equipment and command posts of a mock enemy, AFP cited the statement as saying. After performing the 'electronic' launches, the military personnel carried out a manoeuvre to change their position in order to avoid 'a possible retaliatory strike,' the defence ministry added. The combat units also practised 'actions in conditions of radiation and chemical contamination'. The drills reportedly involved more than 100 servicemen. Russia placed nuclear forces on high alert shortly after Putin sent troops to Ukraine on 24 February and the Russian President has hinted at deploying tactical nuclear weapons, warning of a 'lightning fast' retaliation if the west directly intervenes in the Ukraine conflict. Russia's state television has attempted to make nuclear weapons use more palatable to the public, according to some who spoke to AFP. 'For two weeks now, we have been hearing from our television screens that nuclear silos should be opened,' Russian newspaper editor and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Dmitry Muratov said.", "5e4b78e41d7c8e04e31cae0d000fda2ec5e2fe9afe57a1eb99c90ad8": "Russia is stepping up airstrikes on key Ukrainian supply lines delivering billions of pounds worth of western arms to the country, including on railway lines and warehousing, but the Pentagon insisted the flow of arms had not been significantly impeded. With Moscow and Kyiv locked in a race to shape the conditions for the current phase of the war in Ukraine, the rapid and growing flow of weapons supplied by Ukraine's western backers has become an increased focus for both sides. On Tuesday Russian airstrikes hit six train stations in central and western Ukraine as the Kremlin focused its attacks upon Ukrainian infrastructure, including electrical and water supply substations. A Russian cruise missile also hit a hangar in Odesa housing Turkish Bayraktar TB2 drones as well as missiles and ammunition from the US and Europe, according to the Russian Ministry of Defence. The Pentagon spokesperson, John Kirby, noted that, in the past, Russian forces have not had a good record of hitting what they were aiming at. 'I would just remind you that their ability to target with precision has been less than advertised throughout this entire war. They are not good at precision strikes,' Kirby said, adding that the delivery of US and allied weapons was not seriously affected. 'The flow into the region continues at an incredible pace, and the flow of materials from the region into Ukraine also continues every single day,' he said. 'Those weapons, those systems, are getting into Ukrainian hands.' He suggested that the weapons flows were being sustained by having many alternative supply routes which were continually being changed. As sources indicated that the UK intends to supply Kyiv with cargo drones to carry supplies on the battlefields in the east and south, the flow of western weapons heading for Ukraine was turning into a flood amid US fears of Russian plans to annex the separatist territories of Donetsk and Luhansk in the east, and the Kherson region in the south. The early focus of weapons supplies to Ukraine was initially small arms and defensive equipment but that has changed in recent weeks, not least after the announcement by US president Joe Biden of a $33bn (PS26bn) support package for Ukraine, including $20bn in military aid. Speaking last month, Biden talked of the need for the increased supply of heavier weapons to Ukraine, describing it as a 'critical window' as Russia shifted its focus to the east. The supply of weapons to Ukraine has been given a boost after the military experienced shortages and stockpiles of ammunition had dwindled.  But it has also been driven by an increasingly vocal view among western leaders, including Biden and Boris Johnson, that the threat posed by Russia requires that it be 'weakened'. The US has already rushed about $3.4bn worth of weapons to Ukraine since Russia invaded on 24 February, including anti-aircraft Stinger systems, Javelins, ammunition and body armour. The weapons systems being shipped to Ukraine by the US include C-4, howitzers, Mi-17 helicopters, armoured Humvees, M113 personnel carriers, Switchblade drones and M18A1 Claymore anti-personnel mines, with defence sources confirming that dozens of artillery pieces had arrived in country. US weapons that have already arrived in Ukraine include more than 5,500 Javelin anti-tank rocket systems, which are credited with the heavy toll taken on Russian armour. The latest arms shipments come on top of the Pentagon's confirmation last month that Ukraine had received unspecified fighter aeroplanes and aircraft. The EU has earmarked EUR450m (PS380m) for arms for Ukraine, including air-defence systems, anti-tank weapons and ammunition. The UK is supplying Mastiff heavily armoured patrol vehicles, along with the cargo drones announced this week, and has supplied Ukraine with Starstreak anti-aircraft missiles, 800 anti-tank missiles, and precision munitions. The rapid increase in arms supplies comes as Russian forces have changed tactics since the first phase of the war, before Russian troops withdrew from their failed assault around Kyiv to focus operations on eastern and southern areas of Ukraine.  Russian forces are now relying more heavily on the intensive use of artillery and rockets against largely outgunned Ukrainian defences, not least in the Donbas region. Ukraine has also received weapons from other sources, including Germany which - after initial hesitation - has become one of the biggest arms suppliers to Kyiv, sending Gepard armoured anti-aircraft systems.  The Czech Republic has also sent T-72 battle tanks, while Canada announced last month it had delivered heavy artillery, including M777 howitzers. A Ukrainian military official described last week the increased focus of Russian strikes on infrastructure being aimed at disrupting Kyiv's access to western weapons. 'It is my opinion that they didn't believe the west would give Ukraine the necessary heavy weapon supplies, so now the process has started they feel they need to do something about that. Because western weapons and Ukrainian combat experience combined give us a big advantage.' Speaking during a visit to a semiconductor factory that produces chips for the Javelin missile system on Tuesday, Biden justified his policy. 'This fight is not going to be cheap, but caving to aggression would be even more costly,' he told workers. 'You're allowing the Ukrainians to defend themselves, and quite frankly, we're making fools of the Russian military in many instances.'", "c70f372a65bbff74ab5bfe67bd89deb494bb093c9204700f41097428": "The European Commission president has faced immediate resistance from Hungary after proposing a ban on Russian oil imports to the EU, aimed at ensuring Vladimir Putin paid 'a high price for his brutal aggression' in Ukraine. Ursula von der Leyen said Russian crude oil should be prohibited within six months and refined products by the end of the year to help cripple Putin's war efforts. Member states in Brussels are scrutinising a proposed sixth package of sanctions but in a speech on Wednesday Von Der Leyen said Russian oil flows had to stop, despite the misgivings in some capitals. 'Let us be clear: it will not be easy,' Von der Leyen told the European parliament. 'Some member states are strongly dependent on Russian oil. But we simply have to work on it. We now propose a ban on Russian oil. This will be a complete import ban on all Russian oil, seaborne and pipeline, crude and refined. 'We will make sure that we phase out Russian oil in an orderly fashion, in a way that allows us and our partners to secure alternative supply routes and minimises the impact on global markets.' Since the start of the war in Ukraine on 24 February, the NGO Europe Beyond Coal calculates that the EU has sent about EUR21bn (PS18bn) to Russia in payment for oil. Russian imports account for 25% of oil imports to the EU and are a leading source of revenue for the Kremlin, but the level of dependency varies and Slovakian and Hungarian ministers have already said they will seek exemptions from the proposals. A spokesperson for Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, said there appeared to be 'no plan nor guarantees' on smoothly switching from Russian oil in the proposal. The foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, wrote on Facebook: 'In its current form the Brussels sanctions package cannot be supported, we cannot responsibly vote for it. Hungary could only agree with these sanctions if pipeline imports of crude oil would be exempt from the restrictions. Then Hungary's energy security could be maintained. Now it cannot.' Slovakia has been seeking a longer transition period for its switch from Russian oil, but has been offered only an extra year to work with so far, which the government in Bratislava says is insufficient. The sanctions package will require unanimous support from the EU member states, whose representatives in Brussels are poring over the details with the hope of coming to an agreement by the end of the week. According to the draft text, the EU would not only prohibit imports but ban any of its citizens and companies from involvement in transporting Russian oil, insuring its transfer or maintaining equipment involved in the movement of the fossil fuel. The move to prohibit insuring against oil spills and other unforeseen incidents is significant as much of the world's tanker liability cover goes through companies that are under the jurisdiction of EU law. Sources said a first meeting of EU ambassadors on the subject of the sixth package had been 'tense and difficult'. As Von der Leyen sought to rally the EU to take the next step, she littered her speech with the names of Ukrainian cities and towns that had been subject to brutal Russian bombardments or where evidence of war crimes had been uncovered. She told MEPs the EU should additionally target military figures involved in the massacre of civilians in the town of Bucha, north of Kyiv, and in the siege of the port city of Mariupol with restrictive measures, and block Russian state television from being broadcast in the 27 member states. 'This sends another important signal to all perpetrators of the Kremlin's war: we know who you are, and you will be held accountable,' she said. 'With all these steps, we are depriving the Russian economy of its ability to diversify and modernise.' The EU would also remove Sberbank - Russia's largest bank - along with Credit Bank of Moscow and Russian Agricultural Bank from the Swift payment system, under the draft sanctions package. 'Putin wanted to wipe Ukraine from the map. He will clearly not succeed,' Von der Leyen said. 'On the contrary, Ukraine has risen up in unity. And it is his own country, Russia, he is sinking.' The EU is preparing to be the main funder of Ukraine's economic recovery from the war, with billions already committed, but Von der Leyen called on the US and others to match those funds. Ukraine's GDP was expected to fall by 30% to 50% this year alone, she said, with the IMF estimating that Ukraine would require EUR5bn a month 'to keep the country running, paying pensions, salaries and basic services'. 'We have to support them, but we cannot do it alone,' Von der Leyen said. 'I welcome that the United States announced massive budgetary support. And we, as Team Europe, will also do our share.' She went on: 'Europe has a very special responsibility towards Ukraine. With our support, Ukrainians can rebuild their country for the next generation. 'That is why today I am proposing to you that we start working on an ambitious recovery package for our Ukrainian friends. This package should bring massive investment to meet the needs and the necessary reforms. It should address the existing weaknesses of the Ukrainian economy and lay the foundations for sustainable long-term growth.'", "36c3356f8c31eb6066d4d2ef2ddbfc6fe78e1d70dbcd677072ce232e": "", "356e8a92be64835372ea9f9afbc54bea1081eea3079c1b0c1823a20f": "Men and boys are among the alleged victims of rape by Russian soldiers in Ukraine, where dozens of cases of sexual violence by the invading forces are already under investigation, UN and Ukrainian officials said on Tuesday. 'I have received reports, not yet verified ... about sexual violence cases against men and boys in Ukraine,' said Pramila Patten, UN special representative on sexual violence in war, at a press conference in Kyiv. Patten added that it can be particularly challenging for male rape survivors to report the crime. 'It's hard for women and girls to report [rape] because of stigma amongst other reasons, but it's often even harder for men and boys to report ... we have to create that safe space for all victims to report cases of sexual violence.' She warned that dozens of cases of sexual violence that are under investigation so far 'only represent the tip of the iceberg', as she urged survivors to come forward, and the international community to find perpetrators and hold them responsible. 'Today's documentation will be tomorrow's prosecution,' she said. Ukraine's prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova said on Tuesday that her office had collected reports of sexual violence by Russian troops against men and women of all ages, from children to elderly people. Speaking at a news conference in the shattered Kyiv suburb of Irpin, one of a cluster of small towns whose names have become synonymous with Russian war crimes, Venediktova said Moscow had used rape as a deliberate strategy. 'This is, of course, to scare civil society ... to do everything to [force Ukraine to] capitulate.' There have been few public accounts of sexual violence in Ukraine. Some victims have left the country, and others who have stayed are frightened of speaking about their experience, Venediktova said. However, teams of prosecutors and investigators have been gathering evidence of widespread sexual violence since Russian forces retreated just over a month ago. Gang-rapes, assaults at gunpoint, and rapes committed in front of children are among the grim testimonies they have collected from victims and their families. The country's human rights commissioner Lyudmila Denisova, has officially documented the cases of 25 women who were kept in a basement and systematically raped in Bucha, which neighbours Irpin. Forensic doctors carrying out postmortem examinations on women buried in mass graves say they have also found evidence some were raped before being killed by Russian forces. UN envoy Patten said she was visiting Kyiv because of the overwhelming indications of widespread, systematic sexual violence in the conflict, and the risk to Ukrainian women from trafficking if they try to flee the conflict. 'All the warning signals are flashing red in Ukraine, with allegations of brutal sexual violence emerging,' she said, at a press conference with Ukraine's deputy prime minister Olga Stefanishina. 'I could not stay back in my office in New York, in the face of such harrowing reports of sexual violence. I'm here because we must spare no effort to ensure zero tolerance and consistent consequences for these crimes,' Patten said. While the fighting has ended around Kyiv for now, Russian soldiers still hold swathes of territory in the south and east of the country. Amid growing concern about rape there too, activists are trying to get emergency contraception into Ukrainian hospitals as quickly as possible. Patten warned that for too long, the world had allowed sexual violence to be deployed as a cheap, silent and effective weapon against whole communities. 'Cheap, because it is cost free. Very effective, because it does not only affect the victim, it affects whole families, the communities,' she said. 'It is biological warfare. It is psychological warfare.' She said the UN would work with Ukrainian authorities to provide support for survivors, but is also investigating crimes to prepare cases for criminal trial. Ukrainian investigators have already identified Russian soldiers they allege are responsible for war crimes including sexual violence, and an arrest warrant has been issued for one man accused of rape. There has been international support for investigations, with French and Dutch forensic experts already on the ground. Britain has also promised to send investigators to help gather evidence of war crimes, including sexual violence. But many question whether soldiers who have already retreated will face prosecution, as they are under the protection of the government in Moscow which ordered the invasion and denies committing war crimes.", "0f8dc0cc9b99854cf7676bcaeffc1a6289da853332b68a48cd41cfef": "Ukraine's ambassador to the UK has urged the home secretary to relax the 'unnecessary, long, bureaucratic' visa scheme for those fleeing war, as thousands of Ukrainians remain stranded in Europe. Vadym Prystaiko said he was negotiating with Priti Patel to temporarily lift visa requirements that he said had left many Ukrainians waiting in European towns such as Calais. He said: 'Now it's time maybe for a temporary [relaxation of visa requirements] just to relieve people from this unnecessary, long, bureaucratic and difficult bureaucratic procedures. We are constantly working with the Home Office trying to rebalance this system, trying to find better solutions, but something like temporary relief from visas will help us a lot.' It came as the Guardian revealed the home secretary was facing mass legal action over the 'chaotic' Homes for Ukraine backlog, which has left thousands of people waiting for weeks after uploading all their paperwork and undergoing biometric scans. According to the latest government figures, 59,000 people have had visas approved but have not yet arrived in the UK. Only 15% of the 74,700 Ukrainians who applied under the sponsorship route have made it to Britain. Many people who submitted applications more than six weeks ago, when the scheme launched, are among those apparently lost in the system. Boris Johnson admitted on Monday that the UK could have moved faster to help Ukrainians reach safety. In an interview on ITV's Good Morning Britain, he said the government had 'done a huge amount to help Ukrainian women and children in the area but we're now seeing large numbers come to the UK'. The UK has so far taken in 27,000 Ukrainians overall, which the prime minister said was 'a lot and it's growing fast', but he added: 'Could we have done it faster? Yes, perhaps we could.' Asked why the UK was not offering visa-free travel to Ukrainians, Johnson said that in a wartime situation, some people may be 'pretending' to be refugees. He said: 'It's important to protect the system from those who might want to abuse it. It's also important to protect the women and children from coming to somewhere where they're not going to get the welcome that we would want, so that's why the screening and all the work we've done to make sure that we match up people in the right way, and the results are starting to be really excellent, you're seeing large numbers now.' The UK is an outlier in Europe in requiring Ukrainians to submit to a lengthy visa process before they can travel. This has meant children without international passports, including months-old babies, being required to undergo security scans in Poland before they can fly to safety. Prystaiko said he had asked Patel directly to relax the process temporarily. He said: 'Ukrainians are coming here and in most of the cases have been waiting in European towns next to you, like in Calais ... because we enjoy the visa-free regime with the rest of Europe and unfortunately we never had it with Great Britain.'", "6b28c18c6a286d572fb50f936d04f003f40491520788c7b3b0276cb7": "Russian mercenaries in Africa have been linked to massacres in which several hundred civilians have died, raising new fears about the impact of Moscow's intensifying interventions on the stability and security of countries across the continent. Western officials have so far largely steered clear of naming the perpetrators of killings but witnesses, local community leaders, diplomats and local analysts blamed many of the deaths on fighters deployed by the Wagner Group, a network of private companies run by a close ally of Vladimir Putin. The incidents have occurred in Mali, the strategic west African country where Wagner arrived last year after striking a deal with its new military rulers. Internal Malian army documents seen by the Guardian reveal the presence of Wagner members - referred to as 'Russian instructors' - on 'mixed missions' with Malian soldiers and gendarmes during operations in which many civilians have been killed. According to data compiled by the NGO Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED), as many as 456 civilians died in nine incidents involving Malian forces and Wagner between January and mid-April this year. By far the most serious incident occurred in March when the Wagner Group is alleged to have been involved in a massacre in Moura, a village controlled by Islamist extremists, where between 350 and 380 men were killed over a four-day period. Last week new allegations surfaced about two shootings in villages around the town of Hombori in the central Mopti region, following the death of one or possibly two Wagner mercenaries accompanying Malian troops on operations against Islamist militants. Aid workers, experts and human rights campaigners said one attack came after a military patrol was ambushed on the outskirts of a village at about 9.30am on 19 April. According to an internal Malian military memo, a 'Russian instructor' was injured by an improvised mine and died after being airlifted to the town of Sevare. A medical official in Sevare described the man as a Russian in his 30s.  Following the ambush, Malian soldiers fired on a crowded marketplace. Mali's military rulers, who took power in a coup in May last year, have said the Russians in the country are instructors and not deployed in combat roles. The army - sometimes know by the abbreviation FAMA - has denied a Russian was killed on 19 April and said the casualty was one of their own soldiers. It has also denied killing any civilians and said 18 terrorists had been 'neutralised' during 'vigorous' security operations. Another internal memo described a clash on 23 April between militants and 'a joint patrol of FAMA and Russian instructors' between the villages of Mondoro and Boni. 'Provisional losses' amounted to 'two dead - one FAMA and one Russian - and 10 wounded - six FAMA and four Russians', said the memo, sent some hours after the incident. Details of 'enemy losses' were 'unavailable for the moment'. Twelve other people - who may have been extremists - are also thought to have died. Wagner has been active in a dozen countries across Africa, and it has been repeatedly accused of human rights abuses on the continent. On Tuesday a Human Rights Watch report alleged that forces in the Central African Republic identified as Russian appear to have killed and tortured civilians since 2019, echoing similar findings from a group of UN experts last year. The group has also taken part in the invasion of Ukraine and been linked to atrocities there. British officials have expressed concerns at 'a significant deterioration in the human rights situation' in Mali in recent months, which they noted coincided with the arrival of between 600 and 1,000 Wagner fighters. 'Just as the presence of Russian mercenaries drove an increase in human rights violations and abuses in the Central African Republic in 2021, the same is now being seen in Mali,' one UK diplomat said. The country's new rulers hired Wagner for an estimated rate of $10m a month to be paid both in cash and through rights to extract minerals, experts believe. The group set up a headquarters near the capital's international airport in December, satellite photographs shared by the Center for Strategic and International Studies and flight records reveal, before moving out to forward operating bases across a swath of territory in the centre of Mali in January and February. Community leaders, diplomats and officials have told the Guardian that Wagner fighters have been seen on joint patrols with Malian armed forces along the restive border with Burkina Faso and Niger, on the western frontier with Mauritania, and also in towns in northern Mali, including Timbuktu. Pilots supplied by Wagner now fly Malian army helicopters and the group has also provided fighters who have led Malian forces on bigger operations, notably a major push against Islamist insurgents that began in late February. In early March, more than 30 bodies were found burnt in the town of Niono in central Mali following operations by Malian forces supported by Wagner. Local witnesses accused both Malian and Russian fighters of killing civilians. Many victims had been tied and blindfolded, then shot, according to Human Rights Watch. Malian authorities denied the allegations. Moura, where the alleged massacre of hundreds took place in March, is a village in an inaccessible swampy area of the floodplain of the Niger River which has been controlled for many years by militants from the al-Qaida-linked Group of Support for Islam and Muslims (GSIM). The extremists have imposed their rigorous and intolerant version of Sharia law on inhabitants, raised taxes and made local men follow their dress codes. Amadou Barry, who lives in the neighbouring village, told the Guardian he was attending the weekly market in Moura on 27 March when helicopters suddenly appeared and troops disembarked. A small group of Islamist militants in the village shot at the soldiers and then fled on motorbikes. 'All of us started running in every direction, some into the houses. The Malian army then opened fire on people running, killing so many people,' Barry said. Malian soldiers then marched hundreds of men from the village to a dry river bed nearby for interrogation. The men were held there with little food or water for four days, while soldiers periodically led groups of captives away to be killed, Barry and other witnesses said. Some villagers were released after their fingers and shoulders were inspected for signs that they had fired guns, but all men from the Peuhl ethnic minority were detained, Barry said. The GSIM and other extremist Islamist factions have sought to recruit among the pastoralist Peuhl by exploiting grievances with the government and other ethnic groups. According to survivors, those killed in Moura were all from the Peuhl community. Heni Nsaibia, senior researcher at ACLED, said between 60 and 100 of those killed may have been unarmed Islamist militants, but the rest were civilians. Government forces found large quantities of weapons in Moura. Several witnesses said the operation was led by white men speaking 'a strange language' which some identified as Russian, though most of the soldiers who killed civilians were 'Malian people'. Ousmane Diallo, a researcher for Amnesty International in Mali, said testimony collected from survivors and witnesses confirmed that white soldiers landed in Moura on 27 March in helicopters and stayed for days. 'We know that Wagner are deployed in central Mali, they've been assisting operations in lifting and bringing more soldiers to their positions in the region. I think it's pretty clear that it was Wagner that was conducting this operation,' Diallo said. Nsaibia said his own exhaustive research among survivors led to a similar conclusion, while a west African diplomat in Mali said 'inquiries into the events in Moura had confirmed that Wagner forces were working with Malian forces in central Mali'. Human Rights Watch, the campaign group, called the incident 'the worst single atrocity reported in Mali's decade-long armed conflict'. The Malian army said it killed 203 militants during a military operation in Moura and denied reports of executions. Russia vetoed a bid at the United Nations to commission an independent investigation into the massacre, and Mali has blocked efforts by the UN to send a team to Moura. Moscow's deputy ambassador to the UN said Mali's authorities did 'not have a hidden agenda' and that claims of the involvement of Russian mercenaries in the massacre were part of 'a sordid geopolitical game'. The US and others have alleged that Wagner is funded by the powerful businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is closely linked to Putin. Contacted by the Guardian this week Prigozhin denied any knowledge of the group and denied the reports of massacres. 'Any terrorist killed by the Malian army, the collective west tried to pass off as a civilian ... As to the [alleged] atrocities, neither I, nor the men I know, nor the Malian army have committed them,' he said. Prigozhin accused the Guardian of 'fakes, outright lies and ... falsification' and of trying to 'spit in the face of me, the Russian patriots, and the Malian people'.  Last week, Islamist extremists from the GSIM claimed to have captured a fighter from Wagner in the Segou region in central Mali. The GSIM statement said: 'These murderous forces participated with the Malian army in an airdrop operation on a market in the village of Moura, where they confronted several mujahideen before ... killing hundreds of innocent civilians.' Analysts believe the Wagner operative was probably captured in February. Deaths of 'three or four' Wagner operatives had been 'more or less' confirmed but total casualties were likely to be higher, said Nsaibia. Islamist militant groups were also responsible for killing large numbers of civilians in indiscriminate attacks and many other human rights abuses, officials and campaigners said. Several attacks by Islamic State in the Greater Sahara around Menaka and in the south near Gao last month led to the deaths of at least 40 civilians and displacement of thousands.  The alleged capture of one of its fighters showed how deeply Wagner had become involved in the conflict in Mali, said Jared Thompson, a research associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 'They are now a very direct conflict actor that has skin in the game.' A correspondent in Bamako contributed to this report", "afe9b227ab5dfec15870a0fd6144a63859b870f5faf3a78573fd4d4f": "France's Socialist party and Jean-Luc Melenchon's hard-left La France Insoumise (LFI) party have reached an agreement in principle to form an alliance for June's parliamentary election. The coalition pact, which the Greens and Communists agreed to earlier this week, is an attempt to deprive Emmanuel Macron of a majority in parliament and block his pro-business agenda after he was re-elected president in April. 'We can and will beat Emmanuel Macron and we can do it with a majority to govern for a radical programme,' the LFI lawmaker Adrien Quatennens told Franceinfo radio. If the agreement between the LFI and the Socialists is confirmed, the French left will be united for the first time in 20 years. The deal was shaped under the leadership of Melenchon, who broke from the Socialist party in 2008 over its pro-European Union stance, seeking to 'disobey' the bloc's rules on budget and competition issues and challenge its free-market principles. A source in the Socialist party (PS) said that there was agreement on who would run in what constituency and on overall strategy, but that negotiators still needed to finalise details of the joint programme itself. In particular, the wording on what the platform for the new alliance, which will run under the banner of the 'Social and Ecological People's Union', would say on Europe was still being debated, sources said. The deal would then need to be approved by the PS's national committee. Policies of the new alliance include plans to lower the retirement age to 60, raise the minimum wage and cap prices on essential products. If confirmed, Melenchon's success in striking a deal with the Socialists would mark a turning point for a party that has given the country two presidents since the second world war and has been a driving force for European integration. PS veterans, including the former party leader Jean-Christophe Cambadelis, have already called on fellow members to block the deal, saying it could mark the end of a pro-EU force on the left. But the Socialists had little leeway in the talks after a collapse in the presidential election after their candidate, the Paris mayor, Anne Hidalgo, garnered a meagre 1.75%. Melenchon placed third. In a sign of the Socialist party's collapse, a source close to the talks said the deal - in which only one candidate from each party that joins the alliance run in any of France's 577 constituencies - foresees that the PS would only have 70 candidates in mainland France, and possibly a few more in oversees territories. A recent Harris Interactive poll showed a united left and an alliance between Macron's party and the conservatives neck and neck, with each garnering 33% of the legislative vote. However, in France's two-round election system, projections show this could still translate into a majority of seats for Macron.", "9f7297c3e2f31c8243db473a214138a301331c6b656e08299c1efaef": "Joe Biden has warned that a leaked draft supreme court ruling overturning Roe v Wade, the 1973 case which guaranteed the right to abortion, would represent a huge change in America law and could imperil a wide range of other civil rights. In a historic moment that shook the US to the core and highlighted jagged social and political divisions, the court confirmed the draft was authentic but said it did not 'represent a decision by the court or the final position of any member on the issues in the case'. The US president called the provisional court opinion 'radical' and said the ruling, if handed down, would represent a 'fundamental shift in American jurisprudence' and could imperil rights including same-sex marriage and access to contraception. Politico published the draft by justice Samuel Alito on Monday night. The website said the draft was supported by four other right-wingers on a panel conservatives control 6-3. On Tuesday the chief justice, John Roberts, called its leak a 'betrayal of the confidences of the court' which could 'undermine the integrity of our operations', and promised an investigation. The final ruling of the court will not be made until June. The New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, warned that the court 'isn't just coming for abortion - they're coming for the right to privacy Roe rests on, which includes gay marriage and civil rights.' Biden, speaking to reporters on Tuesday morning, said the draft ruling had ramifications for 'all the decisions you make in your private life, who you marry, whether or not you decide to conceive a child, whether or not you can have an abortion and a range of other decisions [including] how you raise your child'. The draft ruling would allow states to declare abortion illegal. Protesters gathered outside the court on Tuesday, while demonstrations swelled throughout around the country - both in support of and against abortion rights. Thousands have joined rallies in New York, Boston, Nashville, Dallas, New Orleans and more. In San Francisco, a man was arrested after scaling the 60-floor Salesforce tower, in an apparent anti-abortion protest. Outside the supreme court, some chanted 'Abortion is healthcare' and carried signs reading 'Justices get out of my vagina', 'Legal abortion once and for all' and 'We won't go back'. A smaller group chanted 'Hey, hey, ho, ho, Roe v Wade has got to go'. Amid tense exchanges, barriers were erected. Under cloudy skies at the bottom of the steps leading up to the majestic marble columns of the supreme court building near the US Capitol, Haley Lund, from Woodbridge, Virginia, told the Guardian: 'This terrifies me. I could not sleep, so I figured I should be here. 'This opens a floodgate for everyone ... like the right to privacy, to due process, the right that we're innocent until proven guilty. All of that can go away if this goes away.' In a statement, Biden outlined how Democrats might fight back. First, the president said, his administration would argue Roe was based on precedent and ''the 14th amendment's concept of personal liberty'... against government interference with intensely personal decisions'. 'I believe that a woman's right to choose is fundamental,' Biden said. 'Roe has been the law of the land for almost 50 years, and basic fairness and the stability of our law demand that it not be overturned.' Biden said he had directed advisers to prepare responses 'to the continued attack on abortion and reproductive rights, under a variety of possible outcomes'. 'We will be ready when any ruling is issued,' he said. Politico said it received a copy of the draft, which also dealt with Planned Parenthood v Casey, a 1992 case, from a person familiar with proceedings in Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization, a Mississippi case due to be decided this summer. The draft ran to 98 pages including a 31-page appendix of state abortion laws and included 118 footnotes. Alito wrote: 'Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division.' He added: 'We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled. It is time to heed the constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected representatives.' As many as 26 states are expected to enact partial or total abortion bans if Roe falls. Some Republican-run states are expected to attempt to make traveling for an abortion illegal. Democratic-run states have indicated moves to protect and help women who seek an abortion. Vice-president Kamala Harris said: 'The rights of all Americans are at risk. If the right to privacy is weakened, every person could face a future in which the government can potentially interfere in the personal decisions you make about your life. This is the time to fight for women and for our country with everything we have.' Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama issued a joint statement that read: 'The consequences of this decision would be a blow not just to women, but to all of us who believe that in a free society, there are limits to how much the government can encroach on our personal lives.' Polling shows clear majority support for abortion access. Christian and conservative groups campaign to end it regardless. 'I am angry, upset and determined,' said Democratic senator and 2020 presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren, as she rallied outside the court. She added: 'The United States Congress can keep Roe vs Wade the law of the land - they just need to do it.' She was referring to the Women's Health Protection Act, which fell down in the Senate in March, opposed by all Republicans and Democratic senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Warren added: 'The Republicans have been working towards this day for decades ... plotting, carefully cultivating these supreme court justices so that they could have a majority on the bench who would accomplish something that a majority of Americans do not want.' If the court overturns Roe, Biden said, 'it will fall on our nation's elected officials at all levels of government to protect a woman's right to choose. And it will fall on voters to elect pro-choice officials this November.' But legislative success would require reform to the filibuster, a Senate rule which requires 60 votes for most legislation. Moderate Democrats have blocked such moves on issues including voting rights. Biden himself has expressed opposition. This might not be the final ruling on Roe. The court continues to discuss provisional opinions until it issues its final decisions on the biggest cases before it at the end of the annual term, in June. But reproductive rights advocates are alarmed, also about wider implications, such as the right to same-sex marriage, determined in Obergefell v Hodges in 2015. Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor, said: 'If the Alito opinion savaging Roe and Casey ends up being the opinion of the court,' Tribe wrote, 'it will unravel many basic rights beyond abortion and will go further than returning the issue to the states: it will enable a [Republican] Congress to enact a nationwide ban on abortion and contraception.' In a sharply divided Washington, Republicans confirmed three right-leaning justices under Donald Trump, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and, just weeks before the 2020 election, Amy Coney Barrett, a hardline Catholic conservative. Biden has overseen the confirmation of Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black female justice, but she has not yet replaced the retiring Stephen Breyer, another liberal, and her arrival will not change the ideological imbalance. Republicans welcomed the draft ruling and condemned the leak. Josh Hawley, a hardline Missouri senator, called Alito's draft 'tightly argued, and morally powerful.' Among Republican moderates, Susan Collins of Maine - who under Trump supported the appointments of Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh but voted against Barrett - pointed to a possible betrayal. 'If this leaked draft opinion is the final decision,' she said, 'it would be completely inconsistent with what Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh said in their hearings and in our meetings in my office.' Among women's rights campaigners, condemnation of the Alito draft was strong. Laphonza Butler, president of the advocacy group Emily's List, said: 'It's past time to vote out every official who stands against the pro-choice majority.'", "03a370f0e3612a5688b53024b482fe25c6685f16712215e8efdaca87": "The first signs of a backlash to a possible Swedish application to join Nato have emerged within the ruling Social Democrats, at the start of a critical month in which Sweden and neighbouring Finland are expected to move rapidly towards a decision. Sweden is due to publish a security policy assessment report by 13 May, two-weeks earlier than planned, which will involve representatives of all parties in Sweden's parliament, the Riksdag.  The foreign ministry is also due to issue a position paper, before a decision is taken by the coalition government, no later than 24 May. The Social Democrats are eager to avoid a split over an issue that challenges nearly 200 years of Swedish neutrality with a national election in the autumn.  However, local media in Sweden reported the climate and environment minister, Annika Strandhall, who is also the federal board chair of the women's wing of the Social Democrats, as saying the faction had 'a long history and struggle in matters concerning peace, disarmament, detente and military freedom of alliance'. Therefore, Strandhall said: '[We] in the federal board have decided to remain in line with our congressional decisions that Sweden should be militarily non-aligned and stand outside Nato.' The Finnish president, Sauli Niinisto, has said he will make his views known by 12 May, giving himself time to react to what Vladimir Putin may say on Russia's Victory Day on 9 May. Moscow has rejected reports that Putin will declare war on Europe on 9 May but it has threatened unspecified consequences if Nato accepts the two countries as members. There has been a sudden change in Finnish public opinion towards Russia after the invasion of Ukraine with many voters lacking trust in Russia, with whom Finland shares a 830-mile border.  Surveys of the Finnish parliament show close to two-thirds of ministers are in favour of Nato membership. The ruling Finnish Social Democrats are due to hold a debate on 14 May. The parliament is taking expert evidence on the plan, but opinion polls show steady support for membership in the wake of Putin's invasion of Ukraine. This increases to 80% if both the prime minister, Sanna Marin, and president back membership. President Niinisto is scheduled to make a two-day visit to Sweden later this month. The UK's defence secretary, Ben Wallace, was in Finland on Wednesday in a show of solidarity as British troops took part in a joint exercises with Finnish, US and Estonian troops. Advocates of Nato membership support a joint application by both Finland and Sweden to be submitted to Nato ahead of its summit in Madrid on 29 June, to give Nato time to respond with an invitation to join. Finland seems determined to join even if Sweden pulls back. Wallace has been in discussion with the Finnish military about the type of military support the UK, and other Nato powers, could provide in the transition period between application and acceptance of full protection under Nato's article 5. It is not expected that Nato forces would be stationed permanently in Finland in the transition period, but joint exercises might intensify. Finland has not experienced an increase in activity along its border with Russia, or disinformation attacks. But the country has taken steps to minimise its dependency on Russian energy by next winter.", "93326e3b9614efd73b7d1202496a627d02505e23ee506423e1ec9149": "Concerned about sweeping Russia-style sanctions from the west, Beijing has ordered a comprehensive 'stress test' to study the implications of a similar scenario for its economy, the Guardian has learned. According to a person with direct knowledge of the matter, an extensive exercise began around late February and early March when western allies imposed unprecedented sanctions against Moscow. Several key Chinese government agencies - from banking regulation to international trade - have been asked to come up with responses if the west imposed the same embargos on to China. 'Those involved in this exercise use how Russia was treated as a baseline for China's own policy response should it be treated in a same fashion by the west,' the person added. 'This stress test involves a range of methodology, including modelling.' Beijing did not specify why it had asked its vast bureaucracy to carry out such an exercise, the person said. They said that it was a 'natural reaction' from Beijing given its close relationship with Moscow. A second source, who wishes to remain anonymous, said that Chinese diplomats had in the past few weeks also been meeting experts to understand the trajectory of this conflict. 'From Beijing's perspective, if the US-led western allies could take such measures against Moscow, they could also do the same to China. Therefore, it needs to know how resilient the country really is,' said Tong Zhao, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace based in Beijing. But Edward Fishman, a former adviser to John Kerry on economic sanctions at the US state department, said that no economy - not even China - was immune to the types of financial sanctions that the west has wielded against Russia. 'There is no good alternative to the western financial system, and that's likely to remain the case for a long time,' he said. 'The future of economic conflict between the west and China, therefore, will likely be narrower in scope than what we've seen from the west in recent months against Russia. It will centre on jockeying for leverage in strategic areas - such as frontier technologies and next-generation infrastructure - not on trying to produce broad-based economic disruption.' Zhao said that the current exercise by Beijing could be an attempt to understand what the short-term cost to China would be if it provided material support to Russia over the course of this conflict. US officials this week said they had not yet seen military and economic support for Russia from China, despite earlier warnings of the possibility. On 22 April, officials from China's finance ministry and the central bank held a meeting with domestic and foreign banks, including HSBC, to discuss how they could protect China's overseas assets should Russia-style sanctions led by the US and its western allies also be imposed, according to a recent report by the Financial Times. Chinese analysts were caught off-guard by Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, several personnel said. But the western response, according to Zhao, was 'more surprising to the Beijing leadership initially'. 'For the past few years, there's been a growing concern among Beijing's leadership that a strategic conflict between China and the west may not be a question of whether it'd happen, but when it will happen, in particular over the issue of Taiwan.' Beijing has strongly opposed any link to Taiwan when discussing the war in Ukraine, insisting they are two separate matters. Last week, the Chinese embassy in London again criticised British media's comparison of the two, saying the Taiwan issue 'bears on China's core interests and we will brook no external interference'. The information office of China's state council has been contacted by the Guardian for comments. China's foreign ministry in the past week stepped up its rhetorical support for Russia, saying that the two sides 'rise above the model of military and political alliance in the cold war era', and that the two countries 'commit themselves to developing a new model of international relations'. Curiously, around the same time, Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, told the official Xinhua news agency that Kyiv was keen to involve Beijing in ensuring its security. 'We propose that China becomes one of the guarantors of Ukraine's security, this is a sign of our respect and trust in the People's Republic of China,' he said on Saturday. In 2013, China agreed to provide Ukraine with 'security guarantees' if it is invaded or threatened with nuclear attack. But critics say Beijing remained evasive on the same issue after Russia's invasion in February. Kuleba also told Xinhua that European countries are concerned about the situation because they could not guarantee Russia would not invade them tomorrow. 'We also believe that this war is not in China's interests,' he said, adding: 'If Russia is not stopped now, it will lead to more crises a few years later.'", "3416698950d21f88055558ed51f0fb473e544050430e886c9f607250": "Fresh evidence has been found against the prime suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, a German prosecutor has revealed. Hans Christian Wolters said in an interview on Portuguese television that investigators believed they had found 'some facts, some new evidence, not forensic evidence.' Officials in Faro, Portugal, said last week that Christian Bruckner, 44, a convicted rapist, was an arguido, or formal suspect - the first time Portuguese authorities have officially identified a suspect in the case since Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, were declared such in 2007. They were formally cleared of suspicion in 2008. Bruckner has previously denied any involvement in three-year-old Madeleine's disappearance. Wolters, who has been investigating Bruckner since 2020 over the Madeleine case and other alleged offences, was asked in the TV interview whether it was true that German investigators had found something belonging to Madeleine in a caravan used by Bruckner. 'You can't deny it, can you?' the CMTV interviewer asked. Wolters replied: 'I don't want to deny it.' He added: 'We are sure that he is the murderer of Madeleine McCann. We are sure that he killed Madeleine McCann. The investigation is still going on and I think we found some new facts, some new evidence - not forensic evidence, but evidence.' Speaking on the eve of the 15th anniversary of their daughter's disappearance on 3 May 2007, Kate and Gerry McCann said a 'horrific crime' had been committed and they were still seeking answers. They said in a statement: 'This year we mark 15 years since we last saw Madeleine. It feels no harder than any other but no easier either. It's a very long time. Many people talk about the need for closure. It's always felt a strange term. 'Regardless of outcome, Madeleine will always be our daughter and a truly horrific crime has been committed. These things will remain.' Last week, the couple said they welcomed the news that the Portuguese authorities had declared an arguido. They said: 'Even though the possibility may be slim, we have not given up hope that Madeleine is still alive and we will be reunited with her.' German police said in June 2020 that Madeleine was assumed dead and that Bruckner was probably responsible for her disappearance. However, British officers continue to treat it as a missing persons case. Germany, unlike Portugal, does not have a statute of limitations for murder. Wolters, the state prosecutor in Braunschweig, is investigating Bruckner for five separate alleged offences. They include three cases of rape and two cases of child molestation, the most recent in 2017 when Bruckner is alleged to have exposed himself and masturbated in front of a group of children.", "c6f53f8b16189834a08ea1886e0d9faf0f828c23d92624fe8d59ab92": "A New York court has rejected an attempt by Donald Trump to halt a contempt order and $10,000 in daily fines levied against the former US president for failing to properly comply with an investigation into his company. Trump was found in contempt of the court last month for failing to comply with a subpoena from Letitia James, the New York state attorney general, who is seeking financial records for her civil fraud investigation into the Trump Organization. The twice-impeached former president was hit with a $10,000 daily fine by the judge, Arthur Engoron, until he provided the documents sought by James. Trump claims the records cannot be found and attempted to have the fines and contempt order removed. Alina Habba, Trump's lawyer, argued in her appeal that the 'exorbitant fine is wholly unjustified' and the treatment of the property mogul and former host of the TV show The Apprentice was 'unconscionable and indefensible'. However, Engoron has turned down this appeal, leaving Trump with $80,000 in fines to date. The judge criticized an affidavit from Trump that outlined how the company has searched fruitlessly for the documents required by James. 'Mr Trump's personal affidavit is completely devoid of any useful detail,' Engoron wrote. James is investigating allegations that the Trump Organization committed fraud by manipulating the stated valuations of its properties in order to get more favorable terms for loans, insurance rates and taxes. The attorney general's legal team claims the company 'used fraudulent and misleading financial statements to obtain economic benefit'. In February, Donald Trump Jr and Ivanka Trump, two of Trump's children, were ordered to appear to give evidence in the case. They have appealed this order and are awaiting the outcome. Trump himself has called James an 'operative of the Democrat party' and claims he is the victim of the 'greatest witch-hunt of all time'. Trump has become embroiled in a number of legal problems since his presidential term ended last year, shortly after an attempt by his supporters to overthrow the result of the 2020 presidential election. On Tuesday, the Trump Organization and Trump's presidential inaugural committee agreed to pay Washington DC, authorities $750,000 to settle a lawsuit that claimed they illegally misused funds from the non-profit committee to enrich the Trump family. And on Monday, a grand jury was formed in Atlanta as part of a criminal investigation into whether Trump improperly attempted to force Georgia officials to overturn the result of the election in that state. Joe Biden won Georgia on his way to triumphing in the 2020 election.", "6afd60f0ea0ee8764b004c15a75269396ad0d8f730ebedfcd6424c05": "For more than two centuries, residents of a remote Canadian island in the north Atlantic knew they could count on a nearby doctor for relief of most ailments. But this June, Fogo Island will lose the community's only full-time physician, a trend mirrored in many of Newfoundland's towns and villages as the region battles economic decline and a looming demographic crisis. The closest doctor will be a six-hour round-trip by ferry, subject to the vagaries of powerful maritime storms. 'When you consider it's the first time since 1792 that they've been without a resident doctor, it leaves you gobsmacked and really hits home that there's something bigger happening,' said Paddy Daly, host of the popular Newfoundland-based radio show Open Line. 'This is something that's been a long time coming. This didn't happen overnight.' Ever since its cod fishery collapsed in the early 1990s, the province of Newfoundland and Labrador has struggled to regain economic momentum. But the province is also battling a demographic crisis, with deaths outnumbering births and an exodus of residents. In the recent national census, Newfoundland and Labrador was the only province in the country to see its population drop since 2016 and has struggled to retain the immigrants that arrive in the region. Among the hardest hit by the exodus were the smallest settlements, known as outport communities. The lack of doctors has become emblematic of this plight, even inspiring the 2013 Canadian comedy The Grand Seduction. In a the film, the villagers of Tickle Head work hard to lure a doctor to settle in the community by putting on fake games of cricket and leaving money at the wharf. After their physician left in 2021, residents of another outpost, Bell Island, tried to take matters into their own hands, launching the Bell Island Grand Seduction Facebook page, pleading with the region's health authority to send Dr Firas Ayar back to the community. 'We do not want to trick, charm or hoodwink Dr Ayar into returning to Bell Island. We want this platform to be used to show him our love and respect and our desire to have him back in our community,' wrote resident Kenneth Kavanagh. The group eked out a small victory when Ayar returned on a short-term contract. But the broader trajectory of the region suggests these small wins will be rare - especially in communities with dwindling economic prospects. 'In a lot of these places, likely gone are the days when you had a family doctor who knew you and your children and their children,' said Daly. 'And so people will have to think about whether they move to be closer to care, or whether they stay.' Nearly 100,000 Newfoundlanders lack access to a family physician and Fogo Island's recent loss of a doctor highlights the complicated realities of managing a shortage of healthcare professionals. Island resident Sabrina Payne recently decided to sell her home and leave the islandafter long ferry trips to the mainland became too much when she was receiving cancer treatment.  'It took me a long time to make the decision, because I really loved the place,' she told CBC. 'But ultimately my mental health was declining because it was - everything was a chore.' The community, is home to one of Canada's most expensive and famous hotels, whose guests have included the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and Gwyneth Paltrow. The Fogo Island Inn, where the cheapest stay exceeds US$6,000 - is also one of the biggest employers in the community. Shorefast, the company that runs the hotel, is a registered charity that says it invests all of its profits back into the community. Daly suggested Fogo might be one of the few places with the resources and influence to successfully lobby the region's health authority. 'In Fogo's case, it might be that Shorefast plays a role in helping the community secure a doctor,' said Daly. 'Because increasingly it looks as though the places will try to take matters into their own hands.'", "511d3ff092d58d823bb413beffc3291d1898badaaa6ce452cdb6a31c": "", "539dac601a8230393c79b0794261d9032e871cd2a1e9143ca63f1125": "", "825d28d4da3a3fc89376eac4d89aa11b3f6bdde1a60eaa75b3a75aa4": "", "c4aeaeff77d2c76c0d84c33f35b116f4099d1a905a83d68ed6ada055": "", "4a1c2af9dd0a0766fb3581337824e731917d7461971dc47f4c828903": "It all began with the bodyguards, and the balled-up pieces of paper. So many pieces of balled-up paper. The bodyguards pressed them into the hands of teenage athletes and aspiring singers and girls on their way home from prom. They kept slipping them into warm, young hands even after their boss, the R&B artist R Kelly, had been indicted for producing child abuse images in 2002, and acquitted in 2008. On the paper was R Kelly's phone number. The underage teenage girls would contact Kelly in the hope he would help them in their careers, or because they liked his music, or even just out of youthful curiosity: would he text back? None had any clue of the horror that would unfold. Kelly raped and sexually abused dozens of them. He forced them to live according to degrading restrictions, inflicted physical violence upon them, and even, if reports are to be believed, forced them to eat faeces if they displeased him. The full scale of Kelly's depravity is still unfolding: although he was convicted of sexual exploitation of a child, kidnapping and sex trafficking in 2021, Kelly faces a second trial this year for producing child abuse images. It's estimated that he harmed as many as 48 women and girls in his decades-long campaign of abuse. In the end it was the notes that helped to convince the investigative journalist Jim DeRogatis of Kelly's crimes. 'When you hear over decades and from different ends of the country,' says DeRogatis, 'from women who've never spoken to one another, that creepy story of the phone number written on a little piece of paper pressed into the palm of a hand, you think: 'You couldn't make up little details like that.'' The Chicago Sun-Times music critic began investigating Kelly in November 2000, after receiving an anonymous fax telling him that: 'Robert's problem - and it's a thing that goes back many years - is young girls.' The allegations were not totally surprising: there had long been rumours that Kelly married his protege, the singer Aaliyah, in 1994 when she was 15 and he was 27. (These rumours were subsequently confirmed, although the marriage was swiftly dissolved. Full details of Kelly's relationship with Aaliyah have never been disclosed: her family and inner circle have remained tight-lipped, and she died in a plane crash in 2001.) DeRogatis and his colleague Abdon Pallasch began digging into the allegations, and thus began one of the longest-running investigations in journalism, and the most influential. Without their dogged reporting, it's likely that Kelly would still be abusing young women - and some men - with impunity. But DeRogatis is not triumphalist about finally seeing Kelly behind bars. 'Was there satisfaction with the verdict?' he asks. 'You know, the women that I'm still in contact with, to a single one, all said: 'Sure, I'm glad he's convicted, but it's too little, too late for me.' It was very difficult for any of them to take satisfaction out of the fact it took two decades to stop it.' We are speaking over Zoom ahead of a new documentary, R Kelly: A Faking It Special, which will be released on Discovery+ on 4 May, and the forthcoming paperback of DeRogatis's memoir, Soulless: The Case Against R Kelly. Soulless is a gripping account that should be required reading for investigative journalists everywhere: what stands out is the level of sheer tenacity required not only to drag Kelly's crimes into the light, but to make the public care about them. When DeRogatis and Pallasch published their first report into Kelly in December 2000, they assumed the reaction would be so strong that the story would be over, he says. Instead, their investigation - which revealed that Kelly exploited his fame to have sex with a 15-year-old girl - was largely ignored by the national press, and condemned by Chicago's three biggest Black radio stations, who viewed Pallasch and DeRogatis, both white men, as 'trying to tear down a successful Black man', says DeRogatis. DeRogatis is effusive about his former colleague the columnist Mary Mitchell, who is Black and remonstrated with her community to take Kelly's victims, all young Black women, seriously. 'She wrote more than two dozen columns in our first two years of reporting,' says DeRogatis, 'saying: 'These are not white men trying to tear down a beloved Black hero. Wake up, Black community. This is a man who is preying on your daughters.'' Later, Black women would lead the campaign to bring Kelly to justice. Mute R Kelly, the 2017 movement to stop booking Kelly, was founded by Kenyette Barnes and Oronike Odeleye; while dream hampton's 2019 Lifetime documentary series, Surviving R Kelly, built on DeRogatis's reporting to bring Kelly's crimes to an international audience - after its release, federal prosecutors opened an investigation into Kelly that culminated in his criminal conviction. But for the first 15 years of DeRogatis's reporting, it was an uphill battle to persuade the Black community, the wider music scene, the press and the criminal justice system to believe Kelly's victims. 'Where was Rolling Stone?' says DeRogatis, almost spitting the words in anger. 'Where was the Chicago Tribune? Where were the organisations much bigger and better staffed than the Chicago Sun-Times? And the police? Every system in Chicago, schools, journalism, churches, certainly the judicial system with that travesty of a 2008 trial, everybody failed these young Black girls. And, you know, that is the most frequent comment I heard in two and a half decades of reporting. Nobody cares about young Black girls. Nobody is going to believe us.' DeRogatis and Pallasch shared 33 bylines on Kelly between 2000 and 2008, and most of these stories were met with indifference. During this period, Kelly's career flourished. What made DeRogatis keep pushing ahead with the story? 'I'm from Jersey,' he says. 'You know, I've got a thick head, I'm stubborn ... It's this thing I have: no matter how shitty the movie, I have to see how it ends.' DeRogatis is a self-described 'fat rock critic' with arms full of tattoos and a raspy laugh. But it's not hard to see how he won the trust of so many traumatised girls. He has a fatherly air and a warm, self-deprecating humour. Plus, says DeRogatis, 'I also spoke music.' (Many of Kelly's victims aspired to careers in the music industry.) But more than anything, 'it was just a willingness to listen,' he says. He never pushed the women to speak to him; most came to him, rather than the other way around. 'Nothing you say is going to convince a sexual assault victim to go on the record,' he says firmly. 'That has to be her choice.' The only people he ever strong-armed, he says, with a twinkle in his eye, 'were fucking lawyers'. In February 2002, DeRogatis's phone rang. Go to your mailbox, the caller said. Inside was a tape. He slotted it into his daughter's video recorder, and saw Kelly raping a 14-year-old girl and then urinating into her mouth. DeRogatis knew who she was, although he had never met her; he had heard rumours the tape existed, but the reality was more appalling than he had ever imagined. 'It was 26 minutes and 39 seconds of what is often misreported as grainy video,' says DeRogatis. 'But it was crystal clear. So obvious, and horrifying, and disgusting. You know, when you think the average sitcom is half an hour long, to sit through that from beginning to end ... Certainly, we thought he was done then. I mean, how do you escape this?' DeRogatis passed the tape to police, and it formed the basis for Kelly's 2008 trial, which he describes as 'a travesty'. In his view, the judge, Vincent Gaughan, appeared starstruck by Kelly's celebrity, and moved to exclude relevant information, including Kelly's past civil settlements with victims, and his marriage to Aaliyah, from the courtroom. After the acquittal, a juror told the press that 'if they [the prosecution] had presented it, who knows what we would have done'. The period after the trial was one of 'long, sustained pain', says DeRogatis. 'Because I was still hearing from some of these victims - and from new victims.' DeRogatis believes that, after his acquittal, Kelly grew emboldened. 'It amplified to a level of insanity,' he says. Kelly began keeping a cult of brainwashed women, some of them underage, who were starved, beaten and raped. They were made to call Kelly 'Daddy', and thank him when he burped or farted. They dropped out of school and college. Desperate parents involved police, only for police to report that all appeared to be well at Kelly's mansion. When that failed, they contacted DeRogatis. By now, DeRogatis had left the Chicago Sun-Times, and was a freelance reporter. He wrote about Kelly's cult for BuzzFeed News in July 2017, and, finally, his reporting cut through. These were different times - on the brink of #MeToo (the New York Times investigation into Harvey Weinstein was published three months after DeRogatis's BuzzFeed piece). The cult story went viral. The BBC made a documentary, followed by Surviving R Kelly. The Washington Post reported on the executives who had turned a blind eye. Federal prosecutors opened an investigation. But, even though his reporting did finally have the impact he had hoped for, DeRogatis is pessimistic about the state of journalism more generally, which has been decimated by a collapse in advertising revenue and print sales. He had struggled to place the cult story, working with three other media organisations only to have it spiked at the last minute due to legal jitters. Today, his primary income comes from teaching (he is an associate professor of English and creative writing at Columbia College Chicago), while Pallasch, his former Chicago Sun-Times colleague, works in communications. 'I'm encouraged by the next generation,' he says, 'and eager to cheer them on, but the thing is, you need resources for this kind of reporting. It takes money, and that's what's scary, because internet startups and the places that are hiring the students who leave my classes don't necessarily have those resources.' What advice would DeRogatis give to journalists investigating similar stories? 'There's no such thing as too much evidence,' he says. 'Did they tell contemporaries? Are there text messages? Are there photos? Is there video?' It's easy to be complacent, says DeRogatis, and think that, post-#MeToo, the public is generally more inclined to believe sexual assault survivors. But look at the 2018 supreme court nomination, when Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed as a supreme court justice, despite Christine Blasey Ford's claims that he had sexually assaulted her. 'Christine Blasey Ford had a doctorate; she was 100% believable ... We still don't believe women.' 'It's nice that the Pulitzer went to the New York Times and Ronan Farrow for the Weinstein story,' says De Rogatis, 'but these stories are not getting easier, and there are many that are still not getting told.' He has no feeling of closure now that Kelly is in jail. What about those who associated with him? DeRogatis is scathing about executives at Jive Records, which is reported to have made an estimated $1bn from his music; the festivals that booked him, including the indie darlings Pitchfork, even after his first trial for producing child abuse images; and the artists who collaborated with him, including Jay-Z, who toured with Kelly in 2004, and Lady Gaga, who duetted with Kelly in 2013. 'Lady Gaga!' DeRogatis explodes. 'What are you doing? You're a champion of the little monsters, right? You're an inspiring force, a sexual assault victim yourself. A great spokesperson for LGBTQ-plus people. And you make a fucking video with this man! You are far too smart not to have been aware.' Gaga has apologised for collaborating with Kelly; Jay-Z has not. Even now, Kelly's music is still popular, with 4.6m monthly Spotify listeners. DeRogatis finds this distasteful. 'Can we separate the art and the artist?' he asks. 'If you've covered popular music at all, much less as long as I have, you know that a lot of horrible people make great art. Ninety-eight per cent of the time, I think we can separate the art and the artists. But there are certain cases where we cannot ... I think Kelly is one of them, because the art is about the misdeeds.' Kelly famously titled one album, which he produced for Aaliyah, Age Ain't Nothing But a Number; in the 1995 track Down Low, he talks about a 'silly bitch ... screaming 'rape''. DeRogatis sees Kelly as someone with a 'sociopathic glitch. I don't use that word lightly. I do not believe he has empathy for anyone. He's a complete narcissist.' After Kelly's conviction, hampton asked DeRogatis whether he felt a void: after all, his reporting on the superstar has been the spine of his career. Not a bit of it, he says. 'I'm glad not to have to tell that story any more,' he says. 'There's a certain adrenaline rush that comes with reporting big stories. I don't think any drug, besides maybe cocaine, burns you out the way that adrenaline does.' Is there any part of the story that still intrigues him? He considers for a moment, then responds: 'I'd love to know what happened with Aaliyah ... but no one has that story, and I don't know if anyone ever will.' If anyone can bring that story into the light, I think, it's DeRogatis.

He was in the recovery ward two days later when he was woken up by the sounds of war. ' I thought it was a fire alarm,' he said. 'It was a double shock to learn what had happened from a nurse. Not only had Russia invaded my country, but I could barely move after my operation and we needed to get to the bomb shelter.' Serhiy was among 450 patients who were receiving treatment at the National Cancer Institute in Kyiv when Russia invaded on 24 February; 40 of them were children recovering after surgery, chemotherapy or bone marrow transplants. Life changed irrevocably for everyone in Ukraine that day, but the institute's oncologists knew they still had a job to do. They were soon having to operate not only as the leading centre in the country for patients in need of lifesaving cancer treatment, but a refuge from the Russian army's murderous path. For those like Serhiy who were unable to return to their own homes or cities - Mariupol, Kherson and towns near Kyiv were either under bombardment or occupation - the institute was the only place where they could stay.  Serhiy and his wife stayed at the Institute until 20 April before heading to western Ukraine to continue his cancer treatment. 'I'm not alone in this situation,' he said by phone . 'There are thousands of cancer patients from Mariupol and other cities now occupied by Russia who have been left homeless, without work, without money, and on top of all that, we still need to continue our treatment.' Founded in 1920, the National Cancer Institute is one of the oldest and most respected medical institutions in Ukraine. The exterior of its main buildings, which date back to the 1960s and 70s, is adorned by a huge Soviet-era mosaic.  Prior to the invasion, doctors here who had access to operating rooms unparalleled in Ukraine, annually treated more than 25,000 cancer patients and performed 8,000 surgeries.  'The first days of the invasion brought uncertainty and a sudden halt to the usual way we did things,' says Andriy Beznosenko, the institute's lead doctor and a colorectal cancers specialist. 'A quarter of our employees could not get to work or were caught up with moving their families to the west of Ukraine.' Several doctors were also conscripted or volunteered to go to fight on the frontlines. Makeshift beds quickly filled up the corridors located deep within the building to protect patients from missile strikes. With space running out, admitting new patients became difficult. By week two, says Beznosenko, doctors and patients had started to adapt. Where possible, children were evacuated to Poland and adult patients from the east were moved to medical facilities in the west of the country.  But more than two months into the war, 85% of staff have resumed work in Kyiv. Many have even moved into the Institute's premises themselves. 'It's actually been very convenient,' says Beznosenko. 'You practice medicine, hold online conferences with doctors from other countries, analyse the professional situation in oncology and, as a result, you're less distracted, nervous, or in a hurry.' Volunteers at the Institute also set up a 24/7 hotline that offers psychological help to cancer patients faced with the added trauma of dealing with serious medical issues during wartime. Only radiation therapy has not fully resumed operations. Countless Ukrainian cancer patients have, along with the 5 million people who have fled the country, ended up in Poland, Germany, the Baltic states and elsewhere seeking treatment. However many fled without first being able to obtain their medical records. Despite the circumstances, the institute has been able to supply digitised copies of records for many, and sometimes even provide consultations remotely. Beznosenko estimates that between 15% and 20% of Ukrainian cancer patients have had to discontinue their treatment as a result of the Russian invasion.  Medics from the Ukrainian diaspora worldwide, meanwhile, are organising for materials to be sent to the institute. More than 2,000 bottles of Keitrude, one of the most expensive cancer drugs in the world - a single dose costs more than $5,000 (PS4,000) to administer - was recently obtained free of charge via a donation. But the Kyiv clinicians say they are committed to more than diagnosing and treating cancer. They have been reaching out to the top US cancer centres asking them to take in and train Ukrainian oncologists who have fled the war, most of whom are women, since most men are not allowed to leave the country. The bureaucracy of the American medical and legal systems have made this a major challenge, but Beznosenko says they remain determined. His team is also documenting their experiences and the lessons they have learned about wartime cancer treatment for the future research benefit of the international medical community. 'We have an obligation to do so,' he says. 'Let it be that none of them ever need it, but it is better that they are at least aware of what we've managed to do. We didn't have access to the lessons learned by doctors in Syria or Afghanistan.'  The situation remains dire for cancer patients in eastern Ukraine. Two oncology centres, one in Kharkiv and one Mariupol, were completely destroyed by Russian missile strikes and had to cease operations, according to Beznosenko. Nor is the Russian army providing humanitarian corridors from occupied areas to cancer patients who need treatment, he said. Oncology units in Chernihiv, Sumy, and Mykolaiv have repeatedly been hit by missile strikes yet they are continuing to take in patients. Even in peacetime, oncologists engage in a daily fight with a ruthless and unpredictable disease. In this sense, these doctors were already battle-hardened. With help from the global medical community, they feel prepared for a long haul. Ukrainians, Beznosenko said, 'will remember the help we received during this terrible time for centuries to come'.", "76000d6b7e7f00a6020d9637890c7b2f5bea6bf1054fd80651e26d42": "In Ukraine's second city, where the barrage of Russian shelling has been among the most relentless endured, hundreds of people stand in line at a post office, waiting to be given chicken and potatoes. As elsewhere in the country, the mundane institutions of civil society in Kharkiv have had to be hastily repurposed for the goal of keeping its population alive, and about 30 such locations across the city have been turned into food aid distribution points.  Workers at this branch of postal company Nova Poshta, who are being paid by their employer to hand out food instead of post, say that an average of 3,000 people come to their repurposed branch every day, seven days a week. They manage the queues using the post office's ticket system. 'There's no work. The No 1 thing at the moment is humanitarian aid,' says Ihor Shapovalov, a construction worker who lost his job on 24 February and has just received a quarter of a chicken. 'We just want to thank the guys for everything they're doing.' Kharkiv has been one of the worst-hit cities still under Ukrainian control. Since the war began two months ago, civilians have died and been injured almost every day as a result of Russian shelling. On Saturday, one person died and five were injured as a result of mortar fire, according to the regional governor. The city is starting to show signs of life, but its economy is in tatters. Most shops and businesses remain closed. Another man waiting in the queue at the repurposed post office is 30-year-old Zhenia Myrhorod. He says he has tried to get work unloading humanitarian aid at a warehouse, but there is not enough work to go around. 'I even collected metal from the missiles but couldn't find anyone to buy it,' says Myrhorod. 'I'm 30 years old. I've got legs and arms, but nobody wants them.' The postal workers are helped by local volunteers, who were once queueing themselves and then offered to pitch in. They now have a rota. The volunteers say they are also out of work but, by doing this, they feel they at least get some exercise. A large chunk of Ukraine's workforce is unofficially employed, as many employers want to avoid tax and pension contributions. As such, they were not eligible for the $250 (PS200) compensation that the Ukrainian government distributed in March. Yuriy Ponomarenko, a 61-year-old volunteer who unloads the trucks and breaks the frozen chickens up, was a weightlifting trainer before the war. Most of his trainees have left or are fighting. 'This is what I was built for,' he says. As the Guardian interviews people in the queue, several say they are nervous about talking to the media in case it attracts an attack. Local police ask us not to identify the number of the postal branch. In late March, six people died and 15 were injured when a rocket hit a queue at another Nova Poshta. Meanwhile, about 1,000 young people in Kharkiv are distributing food door-to-door to those who are unable to leave their houses, says Oleksandr Getmantsev, who has been volunteering since the first weeks of the war. Alex and his group collect donations, mostly from Kharkivans who have fled and want to help those still in the city. Getmanstev and his friend Zoya Zakharova visit around five addresses a day of people who get in contact with them through word of mouth. Many of those they visit are pensioners who have money in their accounts but cannot walk to the few functioning post offices to retrieve it. Others, like his mother, live in northern Kharkiv, which is under constant bombardment. People in the worst affected areas on the edges of the city have nowhere to buy food and often no means to cook it because gas and electricity have been cut off. Many of them are living in basements and only come out to cook on makeshift barbecues outside. 'My mother doesn't want to leave her home. I'm not sure what it would take for her to leave - they are bombed constantly,' says Getmanstev with a laugh, adding that he visits her about once a week on his rounds. 'I guess she's got used to it.' At least two international organisations have recently started work in the city, but Getmanstev says it is difficult to evaluate the impact they are having on the ground as they have not been visible. The last time the Guardian visited Kharkiv in late March, the city's governor said that international organisations were sending large quantities of aid but were not on the ground. One woman, Viktoria Anatolivna, is 32 weeks pregnant with twins and alone with her six-year-old son, Danylo. She says they have only been outside four times since the war started because of the shelling. She wraps Danylo in duvets in the bathtub with the cat when the shelling starts, and takes the floor in their corridor for herself. 'I've run out of money and all my relatives have left,' she says. She relies on the volunteers, and some soldiers who also bring them food. Anatolivna gave birth to Danylo at the maternity hospital near their house but will have her twins in a hospital in the city centre. The maternity clinic nearest her is overseeing births in the basement because of the shelling, and it would be an extra risk with a twin birth. The last stop on the food donations route is Nadia Chaikovska, a 70-year-old woman who now takes care of more than 20 cats who were abandoned by fleeing neighbours. Alex and Zoya bring her sacks of cat food. 'I've already buried five that I've found lying around,' says Chaikovska. 'I just love animals. These cats are sterilised; some of them are pedigrees. They can't survive on their own.'", "3773f36e5e4e0d707d2918275dc90bf29efb9143fade526eb4fe8353": "Last month, an Ohio court certified a class action lawsuit brought by lawyer Rob Bilott that would cover 7 million people - and at some point possibly everyone living in the United States - who have been exposed to certain hazardous 'forever chemicals' known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances or PFAS. The chemicals have been linked to cancer, birth defects, kidney disease and a range of other human health problems. They are called 'forever chemicals' because they do not naturally break down, persisting indefinitely in the environment. Two types of PFAS - PFOA and PFOS - have been found to be so harmful that they are being phased out of use. In addition to US multi-national company 3M, the class action lawsuit names 10 other companies that produce PFAS, which are used to make cookware, food packaging, water-resistant fabrics, firefighting foam and other products. The Biden administration last year pledged to undertake a massive PFAS mitigation strategy at a cost of more than $10bn. The Guardian spoke to Bilott about his lawsuit. The remarks have been edited for length and clarity. You have spent 20-some years now focused on exposing the danger of a class of chemicals we call PFAS, using litigation to try to hold companies involved in spreading PFAS accountable, and pressuring regulators to step up and do more to protect the public. You've written a book, Exposure, been featured in the New York Times as 'The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare,' and your legal battle has been made into a Hollywood movie called Dark Waters, as well as a documentary. Why are you so passionate about this issue? This is a worldwide public health threat. It's very frustrating when you step back and you look at the science that has gotten even clearer over the years about how dangerous these chemicals are and how widespread their use is. The companies knew that if they put these chemicals out into the world they were going to get into our water, into our soil, into the wildlife, into us, yet they did it anyway. And now, after making billions of dollars for decades, those same companies are fighting any responsibility and trying to shift the cost of cleaning this mess up on to all of us. I'm trying to do what I can to make sure that not only is the health threat addressed but that the right people, the ones who actually caused the health problems, are held responsible - not all of us. Most people might associate your work with your battle against DuPont, a large manufacturer of PFAS chemicals used to make such things as Teflon coatings in cookware. But now you're taking on many more manufacturers. What do you hope to achieve with this case? We first uncovered the existence of these chemicals in litigation against DuPont, which had been purchasing a chemical called PFOA from its manufacturer, 3M, and using it to make Teflon. We slowly started to realize that we've got not just PFOA but this bigger group of PFAS chemicals now being found in the environment, and in blood. But we were told that all the science that had been done was only on PFOA and that nobody had done similar research yet on these other chemicals. The companies said it was up to the exposed people, it was their burden, to prove that these other PFAS chemicals were causing harm. So in 2018 we filed the class action. The goal is not to get money damages but to have a federal court require that a new scientific panel be set up that would have the ability to look at this mix of PFAS chemicals in our blood and confirm the extent to which they are in fact causing harm. We want the companies to fund independent scientists to do whatever science might be needed to confirm these harms. Last October President Biden announced a plan to 'prevent PFAS from being released into the air, drinking systems, and food supply... and expand cleanup efforts to remediate the impacts of these harmful pollutants.' That plan is expected to cost taxpayers billions of dollars. Biden has set aside $10bn just to deal with PFAS in drinking water. You recently sent a letter to the Biden administration addressing the plan, offering your assistance and support. But you also expressed a very firm opposition to taxpayers' money being used for cleanup of PFAS pollution. Are you frustrated not just with the manufacturers but also with the EPA? It is frustrating that we've had several different PFAS 'action plans' announced over the years dating back to 2009. Nothing happened with the first plan and then we had another plan announced in 2016. More promises were made and again nothing happened. And so we've got this new plan that has been announced. (But) we're still seeing debate about to what extent should these materials be regulated, should they be declared hazardous or not. What I came to understand after dealing with this for so many decades is that we have a real systemic problem with the way our regulatory system is set up, the way in which science is generated, the way in which papers are published, peer reviewed, how that all interacts with our legal system, who has the burden of proof, who is being told they have to prove whether a chemical is safe versus whether it is harmful. All that creates a perfect storm of inaction. The only way people have been able to get clean water, to get compensated for the damage, the cancers that have been caused, is to go into our court system and try to fight this out in court for years. It is almost as though there is this intentional system of roadblocks baked into the system. So it sounds great, telling the public that we're moving forward, we are going to actually start cleaning this stuff up, we're going to allocate billions and billions of dollars to do that. But the money should not be coming from us, the exposed people. The taxpayers should not have to fund cleaning this up. We shouldn't have the federal government essentially bail out these chemicals companies by allocating billions that the companies should be spending to clean this up. You have gained access to voluminous files of internal documents from the various companies you've sued over PFAS. Many of these documents show that the companies were aware decades ago that PFAS was harmful, and notably that it was spreading widely, accumulating in humans. Can you elaborate on that? It's very eye opening when you start digging into the internal files of what these companies knew, what information they had access to going back decades, that they simply didn't share with the rest of us. For example, one of the things we found in the internal files of the main manufacturer of the chemical PFOS, was that this company was well aware by the 1970s that PFOS was being found in the general US population's blood and was being found at fairly significant levels. In fact by the 1990s, 3M's own scientists had sat down to calculate what a 'safe' blood level would be for PFOS. At the time, they knew that the level of PFOS being found in the general US population's blood was around 30 parts per billion. And when this internal 3M scientist sat down to calculate a safe blood level, the number he calculated was 1.05 parts per billion. Some 30 times lower than the level that was actually being found. Why weren't the rest of us told that? Why weren't we warned? We only find out about that decades later. Documents like that make it clear the potential risk to human health was recognized decades ago. Yet here we are in the year 2022 still arguing about whether we should take steps to get rid of them - and who should be held responsible for all this. This is one of the reasons why I'm doing everything I can so people can see the facts for themselves and draw their own conclusions about who ought to be responsible for the threat that has been caused. This story is co-published with the New Lede, a journalism project of the Environmental Working Group.", "0fe4acca0d2949d5dd459c87d35c76358ff1dcc87f1b67fd5c6821c1": "Matt Davis is surveying his land while sipping a knock-off beer. His property would fit into the average Queensland farm more than 5,300 times and he can afford to relax - there are no fences to mend or animals to feed and his crops are impervious to the vagaries of the weather. Davis is an exotic mushroom grower, his pocket-sized farm in the equally diminutive town of Harrisville, south-west of Ipswich, a repurposed lawn bowls club. The former cafe owner started growing mushrooms at home for family and friends. 'I spent five or six years studying mushroom growing and learning everything I could from reading books, and watching YouTube and Facebook videos and just connecting with people and asking questions,' he says. 'When this unique property came up for sale, I thought it would be perfect for commercial growing.' A former second world war army barracks, the property once housed soldiers stationed at Archerfield airport before being redeployed as Harrisville District Bowls Club in the 1950s, quickly becoming the social heart of the small rural community. But with an ageing membership, the club folded in 2016, the once immaculately-trimmed green consumed by weeds and bindi patches. Sold and used for storage, it was back on the market in 2020, a serendipitous time for Davis, who jumped at the opportunity to progress his hobby into a business. Now, with Scenic Rim Mushrooms, he sells pink oysters and freckled chestnuts grown in temperature-controlled rooms to some of the region's top restaurants as well as visitors who cross the old bowling green to his 'farmgate' shop. 'Look, I think if you're passionate about something and if the business plan makes sense, then you should just go for it because we only get one life and you've got to have a crack, you know?' he says. Davis's operation is emblematic of a new generation of small-scale farmers being welcomed into semi-rural Queensland communities. These farming first-timers are happy to take advice while also seeking to do things differently, with diversified income streams and a greater focus on sustainability. Nick Holliday worked in a law firm, as a union organiser and as an air-conditioning technician before buying Belvedere Farm, north-west of Brisbane, in 2014. His intention initially was to live on the property and commute to his job. 'But once I started raising cattle and chickens, I became deeply interested in the idea of feeding people, as well as using livestock to building soil organic matter,' he says. In addition to their own eight hectares, Holliday and his wife, Brydie, now lease another 60, still well below the average farm size in Australia of 4,300 hectares. The couple practise agro-ecological farming, using temporary fencing and feeding troughs to rotate cattle around different pastures every day, followed by the chickens, to further aerate and naturally fertilise the soil. On their leased land, an old dairy farm, they're using pigs to clear lantana and regenerate the degraded soil. To ensure a regular income, the Hollidays operate Belvedere Farm via community-supported agriculture (CSA). Their subscribers buy into the farm's projected harvest for a set period, receiving monthly deliveries of pork, beef and pastured eggs. Davis, too, has incorporated a subscription model into his business plan, albeit for different reasons. With demand for his Lion's Mane mushrooms, appreciated for their medicinal as well as culinary benefits, greater than he's able to supply, his subscribers get first dibs. These loyal customers appreciate the operation's light environmental footprint, with power for the temperature-controlled rooms provided by solar panels, minimal water use and the mushrooms grown on sawdust, a byproduct of the milling industry. 'It's not just for our conscience - restaurants are really wanting products and producers that are sustainable these days,' Davis says. While both the hands-in-soil and the business end of farming can be a sharp and sometimes devastatingly cruel learning curve, both Davis and Holliday have been gratified by the support they've received. 'There's a really awesome movement of new farmers,' Holliday says. 'First generation farmers - young people who are undertaking these practices and there are some great mentors, particularly holistic management educators who have adapted methods to an Australian context. We've been very lucky to have the opportunity to learn off a lot of other really good farmers.' Davis says the local council, keen to attract tourism to the region, has also provided business development courses and mentorship programs. Jo Sheppard, CEO of Queensland Farmers' Federation, says many young farmers are 'enjoying the diversity modern farming can offer'. This includes 'the opportunity to create a sustainable farming enterprise through efficient production, strategic investment decisions and diversification into emerging areas such as agritourism and natural capital.' Kate Keating is the south-east Queensland co-ordinator for Young Farmers Connect, a national not-for-profit network that provides resources and peer support for young farmers. She says small-scale farming is on the increase and proving a boon for the communities they settle in as well as consumers. 'They're fostering strong relationships between grower and consumer and educating people on the true value of food and in doing so, bringing a sense of connection back to our local communities and cities,' she says. For Kate Creasey, of Olive View Estate, the career transition from event producer and vintage makeup artist to olive farmer necessitated a hasty education in horticulture. 'When we moved here, the trees were drought-affected and hadn't fruited for a couple of years. The previous owner had just sort of lost heart.' But with lots of advice and support, she and her father have managed to double the size of the trees and had two successful fruitings since buying the farm together 18 months ago, she says. 'The first season, there were heaps, but they were very small fruit. This year we have a smaller crop, but the fruit is absolutely massive, plumped up with all that extra rain and nutrition. We've actually had other growers message us to ask us how we got them so big.' Creasey's not putting all her eggs (or olives) in one basket though. Like a growing number of farmers, she's mitigating risk with agritourism, a sector projected by the Queensland Farmers' Federation to be worth a potential $4.5 billion by 2030. Like Davis, she has a 'farmgate stall', a quaint 1950 Morris bus, formerly used as a broadcast bus for the Melbourne Olympics, restored by her vintage-loving (and olive-loathing) father where she sells jars of olives, tapenades, oil and more. She's also using her events experience to host weddings and other celebrations in the picturesque olive grove and has renovated a cottage on the property to run as an Airbnb. One thing stopping more people embracing a life on the land is often the start-up capital required to purchase property. 'We've been very fortunate that I owned this land before the price of land around here accelerated out of the reach of a farmer,' Holliday says. However, QFF says it is increasingly seeing out-of-the-box solutions such as share farming or, as the Hollidays are doing, leasing more land. Demand for Belvedere's eggs is so great the couple are looking to expand their flock from 300 to 1,000 hens. But while the business is growing exponentially, their life goals remain modest. 'We have no aspirations to control huge tracts of land or buy a Maserati,' Holliday says. 'We just want to have good jobs and pay ourselves a decent white-collar salary, feed people and heal the country.'", "932426d5f3134102d2bab9138ab07eb07635ec28fd716929b52e3bf0": "Author JD Vance won the Senate Republican primary in Ohio on Tuesday, securing a victory after receiving Donald Trump's endorsement in the hotly contested race. Vance was leading the crowded pack of primary candidates with 32% of the vote when the Associated Press called the race, about two hours after polls closed. Former state treasurer Josh Mandel looked likely to finish second, and state Senator Matt Dolan, who saw a last-minute surge in support, rounded out the top three. Addressing supporters in Cincinnati, Vance thanked Trump for his endorsement and attacked the media for highlighting his past criticism of the former president. 'They wanted to write a story that this campaign would be the death of Donald Trump's America First agenda,' Vance said. 'It ain't the death of the America First agenda.' Vance, the bestselling author of the memoir Hillbilly Elegy, will now face Democratic congressman Tim Ryan in November to determine who will fill the seat of retiring Republican Senator Rob Portman. Ryan, who ran for president in 2020, easily fended off a primary challenge from progressive candidate Morgan Harper. Delivering a message of unity to his supporters on Tuesday, Ryan promised to 'build a home for Ohioans' regardless of their political party. 'The work is just beginning. The fight is just beginning. We're going to heal the country - heal Ohio and in turn heal the United States of America,' Ryan said in Columbus. The Ohio race could prove crucial in determining control of the Senate, as Republicans look to retake the upper chamber this November. The Senate is currently evenly split 50-50, but Democrats have the majority thanks to the tie-breaking vote of Kamala Harris. If Republicans can pick up just one seat in the midterm elections, they will regain control of the Senate, and holding Portman's seat will be key to those efforts. Vance starts his general-election campaigning with a clear advantage in the race, as Trump defeated Joe Biden in Ohio by 8 points in 2020. Democrats across the country are also at a disadvantage, as the president's party usually loses seats in the midterm elections and Biden's approval rating has been mired in the low 40s for months. Despite the obvious challenges ahead, Ohio Democrats voiced optimism about Ryan's chances in November, saying he would sell voters on his vision for the state's economic future. 'As Ohio's next US Senator, Tim will keep working alongside Sherrod Brown to level the playing field and invest in our state so that we can out-compete China and create more opportunities for working families in every corner of our state - a far cry from any of the unaccountable and out of touch millionaires vying for the GOP nomination in this race,' said Elizabeth Walters, chair of the Ohio Democratic party. Trump announced his endorsement of Vance last month, arguing that he would have the best chance of victory against Ryan. Trump's endorsement was viewed as somewhat of a gamble in the race, as Vance had previously been trailing in polling behind Mandel and businessman Mike Gibbons. Vance's victory now provides another data point in how influential Trump's endorsement remains among Republican primary voters, underscoring the former president's firm grip on the party. Several of the primary candidates in Ohio had openly campaigned for Trump's endorsement, but Vance won him over, partly thanks to his performance in recent debates. Vance ran his primary campaign as a Trump acolyte, calling for completing the wall along the US-Mexican border and demanding an end to abortion in the US. But just six years ago, Vance was one of the most prominent conservative critics of Trump, denouncing him as 'America's Hitler' and a 'moral disaster'. 'He's the guy that said some bad shit about me,' Trump said of Vance during a rally in Ohio late last month. 'If I went by that standard, I don't think I would have ever endorsed anybody in the country.' But Vance completely abandoned his past criticism of Trump as he launched his Senate bid last year. Appearing alongside Trump at last month's rally, Vance praised Trump for having 'revealed the corruption in this country like nobody else'. 'I wasn't always nice, but the simple fact is, he's the best president of my lifetime,' Vance said. The Republican primary was defined by ugliness and mudslinging, as attack ads flooded Ohio's airwaves in the run-up to the election, but the last days of the race were also characterized by silliness. Speaking at a rally in Nebraska on Sunday, Trump misidentified Vance as 'JD Mandel,' apparently confusing him with one of his opponents. The comment instantly attracted mockery from Democrats and Vance's competitors. Despite the jokes made at his expense, Vance laughed off Trump's slip of the tongue and insisted (correctly as it turned out) that his campaign was on the path to victory. 'I think President Trump gives probably thousands of words of speeches every single week,' he said. 'He's going to misspeak every now and then. But the president's very much on board.'", "c6553c7faaf0a4e156ac7d6ea7b2d6e67c7c2e1d10b395f321e10cdc": "For the first time, cities across Israel have scrapped fireworks displays that normally mark the country's Independence Day out of consideration for military veterans and others with post-traumatic stress disorder. Parties and celebrations that begin on Wednesday evening in more than a dozen cities, including Tel Aviv, will not be accompanied by the cracks and bangs of fireworks. Israeli authorities in Jerusalem have opted instead for a silent pyrotechnic show. The move comes after increasingly vocal concerns from former soldiers, who say that the noisy festivities bring back the horrors of war. 'After much thought and consideration, which also included a comprehensive survey, I decided that there will be no fireworks at Independence Day ceremonies this year,' the mayor of Tel Aviv, Ron Huldai, said in a statement. 'One of the things that shaped and influenced the decision were appeals from soldiers struggling with PTSD seeking to cancel the show, as well as full consideration for the people living with disabilities. I hope that next year we will find a suitable alternative.' 'For most Israelis, fireworks are maybe a nice image in the sky, but for [veterans] it is the sound of gunfire and battle,' the Israeli culture minister, Hili Tropper, wrote in a Facebook post announcing that this year's national ceremony in Jerusalem would proceed without fireworks. 'They have fought enough. They have paid a heavy price. This year we are reaching out to them.' Currently, Jewish men and women in Israel must complete at least two years' military service. The country has fought several wars since its creation 74 years ago, and occupied the Palestinian territories since 1967. According to Israeli defence ministry figures from 2020, about 5,000 former soldiers are recognised as having PTSD, although the actual number is believed to be much higher. The country was shaken this time last year when a 26-year-old veteran of the 2014 Gaza war suffering from PTSD set himself on fire near Tel Aviv, resulting in severe injuries. The incident prompted debate over the adequacy of support systems for wounded and psychologically ill soldiers. 'Awareness of PTSD is growing among the public ... There isn't a single family who doesn't know someone with PTSD,' said Prof Yair Bar-Haim, the acting director of the National Centre for Traumatic Stress and Resilience at Tel Aviv University. 'More veterans are coming forward to talk about their difficulties than before. It's a gradual process, but I think it's becoming very clear to Israelis that people who experienced war should be accommodated and taken seriously. When you weigh the price the people we sent to war paid, versus 15 minutes of joy seeing fireworks in the sky, it's an easy decision.' About 5% to 8% of Israel's general population has been diagnosed with PTSD, comparable with rates in western countries, although the proportion with conflict-related psychological difficulties is higher, Bar-Haim said. In the occupied Palestinian territories, where data is patchier, one survey found 23.2% of Palestinian adolescents suffered from PTSD. Dr Samah Jabr, a leading psychiatrist in Ramallah, has argued that the diagnosis does not adequately describe the Palestinian experience of trauma, which she calls 'repetitive and ongoing'.", "e9b61a5e703997bf85ae37cb9f767f0719ed284b77e60d2b60d8f94c": "Beijing has reopened a mass isolation centre as authorities seek to contain an outbreak of Covid-19 in the city. The Xiaotangshan Fangcai hospital, which holds at least 1,200 beds and testing facilities, was first opened during the 2003 Sars epidemic, and used again in early 2020 to treat Covid patients. Its reopening signals a ramp up in efforts by China's capital to manage the rising number of cases without going into a city-wide lockdown. On Wednesday, China reported 5,489 cases, including 353 symptomatic. Most (4,982) were in Shanghai, which has been under a weeks-long lockdown sparking widespread complaints and protests over food shortages and overzealous enforcement. Beijing reported 46 symptomatic cases and five asymptomatic on Wednesday, bringing the city's total since the start of its Omicron outbreak to about 400. As Shanghai's case numbers soared into the thousands, authorities raced to identify and isolate every case, regardless of severity. Hundreds of thousands were transferred to temporary hospitals, requisitioned office buildings and residential blocks, and repurposed convention centres. Conditions in some facilities prompted complaints, with bright lights 24/7, limited water and unsanitary conditions. In a statement the Beijing Municipal Health Commission said it had reopened the Xiaotangshan hospital as a precaution, describing the battle against the Omicron spread as a chess game. It said one isolation unit was already operating, with 40 medical personnel treating 12 people with asymptomatic or mild cases. Ahead of the five-day May Day holiday, authorities last week imposed some community-specific lockdowns, movement restrictions, and closed entertainment and public venues, including Universal Beijing Resort. Restaurants have been banned from offering dine-in services, and on Wednesday the city announced dozens of underground train stations and more than 150 bus routes would be closed from midnight. It is running frequent mass testings of millions of residents, with 12 of the 16 Beijing districts conducting the second of three rounds this week, having done three mass screenings last week. Cases are being recorded across multiple cities and provinces in China, with hundreds of millions of people under some form of full or partial lockdown. In Henan province, the city of Zhengzhou announced movement restrictions from 4-10 May, including remote schooling and some working from home. Henan reported 12 symptomatic and 38 asymptomatic cases on Wednesday. China's Communist party government has committed to a zero-Covid policy, which analysts say is now so entrenched in politics there is no sign of a way out. Currently, health authorities have said China cannot reopen as its vaccination rates - especially among elderly people - are too low, and the country's distribution of health resources inequitable. However, the more transmissible strain of Omicron has challenged the zero-Covid playbook. Beijing authorities appear to be hoping they acted early enough to avoid a Shanghai-style crisis. The lockdown in Shanghai has begun to lift in some areas, but most people remain unable to leave their housing compounds. Residents have reported numerous cases of overzealous or incompetent action by health workers. Viral videos on social media this week have shown protective suit-wearing workers kicking down the door of a home where the residents said they were still waiting for a test result. A video of mortuary workers collecting the body of an aged care home resident who had been declared dead, but discovering they were still alive, also sparked alarm. There have also been major concerns over the way deaths are reported, with the official toll far lower than believed. The low reporting is due to China's strict regulations on attributing Covid-19 as a cause of death when there are other factors, but the reporting of some fatalities has caused confusion. The zero-Covid policy is also hurting domestic consumption and factory output, disrupting key global supply chains and shrinking revenues for some of the biggest international brands, such as Apple, Gucci-parent Kering and Taco Bell-owner Yum China. Capital Economics estimates the virus has spread to areas generating 40% of China's output and 80% of its exports - all facing various degrees of restrictions.", "f1196e3deca09fdb88afcb519d14987bc43f6b6f8f85a67f83a8aad8": "Elon Musk has said Twitter may charge a 'slight' fee for commercial and government users, in the latest hint of the changes the world's richest person could introduce after he completes his takeover of the social media platform. 'Twitter will always be free for casual users, but maybe a slight cost for commercial/government users,' Musk said in a tweet. In another tweet, he added: 'Some revenue is better than none!'  Musk's latest suggestion of changes to Twitter came as British MPs invited the multibillionaire to discuss his proposals for the platform 'in more depth' before a parliamentary committee. The Tesla chief executive has agreed to buy Twitter for $44bn (PS35.2bn), in a deal funded by $21bn of his own money, a further $12.5bn borrowed against his shareholding in Tesla and the rest made up by loans from banks. The estimated $1bn in interest costs attached to the funding have raised speculation that Musk will introduce charges on the platform and cut costs in order to make the transaction financially viable. The Wall Street Journal also reported on Tuesday that Musk could refloat Twitter - which listed on the New York Stock Exchange nine years ago - on the stock market in a few years once he has overhauled the company. In a series of tweets referring to his ambitions for the platform in recent weeks, Musk has suggested a number of changes to Twitter, including making the algorithms, which curate what users see on the platform, 'open source' - or transparent to developers and users. He has also pledged to defeat spambots, and 'authenticate' all humans. Last week it was reported that Musk had told banks he would develop new ways to monetise tweets and crack down on executive pay to slash costs at the social media platform. Musk also told the banks he planned to develop features to grow business revenue, including new ways to make money out of tweets that contain important information or go viral, sources told Reuters. At the annual Met Gala in New York on Monday, Musk said the reach of Twitter was only 'niche' and he would want a much bigger percentage of the American population to be on it. Twitter has 229 million daily users worldwide. In tweets that were subsequently deleted, Musk suggested changes to the platform's premium subscription service, Twitter Blue, including slashing its price, banning advertising and giving an option to pay in the cryptocurrency dogecoin. Meanwhile, the digital, culture, media and sport committee published a letter inviting Musk to discuss his plans for Twitter with MPs. The letter from its Conservative chair, Julian Knight, said Musk's reference to authenticating accounts was of particular interest to the committee, which has called for a minimum standard for age-checking that also protects privacy. Knight added: 'I ... wish to take this opportunity to invite you to speak before our committee and discuss your proposals in more depth. I know you have expressed your wish that critics remain on Twitter and this may present an opportunity to address any critiques in public.'", "c3d105aa75609867d00218024c0717362808e2cba590e6cfbd40954f": "The owner of Capital FM and LBC told its journalists to avoid reporting allegations of sexual misconduct against the DJ Tim Westwood, who presents a show on another of the company's outlets, according to staff at the company. It is understood that Global is also dealing with questions from its employees over whether the business looked into anonymous allegations about Westwood that were widely circulated on social media in 2020 - which were denied at the time. Staff in Global's newsroom - which provides news bulletins for the company's radio stations including LBC, Capital, and Classic FM - were told last week by managers to avoid mentioning the allegations about Westwood, according to sources at the company. Some presenters on its radio stations were also advised not to discuss the accusations on air. While other media outlets reported on the joint investigation by the Guardian and the BBC, listeners to Global's outlets do not appear to have been informed of the claims as management worked out how to handle the story, according to multiple sources. The recent investigation into Westwood has also prompted staff at Global to question whether the company acted on previous anonymous social media accusations. Global is a giant in the British commercial media world, and has recently hired big name journalists from the BBC such as Emily Maitlis and Andrew Marr. Yet despite its commercial success, Global avoids much of the attention received by public broadcasters such as the BBC, partly because it is privately owned by the family of founder, Ashley Tabor-King. The Guardian went to Global for comment soon after publishing its investigation into Westwood last Tuesday. The following day the company announced it was temporarily parting ways with Westwood, who has presented a Saturday night show on its Capital Xtra station for the past decade. However, this is not the first time Global has been alerted to accusations about the presenter. A number of anonymous allegations of inappropriate behaviour about Westwood circulated on social media in June 2020. Back then staff at Capital Xtra told the Guardian that they had asked management to investigate the social media accusations - claims that were strongly denied by Westwood. Several Capital Xtra presenters went further and publicly tweeted that they would seek answers from Global management. Leah Davis, who presents a late night Capital Xtra show, wrote in 2020 that she had seen claims of 'some terrifying and stomach turning accounts' and would be 'doing what I can to make sure this is addressed'. Her message was retweeted by fellow presenters Yinka Bokinni and Shayna Marie, and the weekend afternoon host Robert Bruce. Other staff at the station liked and retweeted messages expressing support for black women, while the presenter Remel London posted at the time: 'Trust me when I say we're not being silent! We want answers too!' A spokesperson for Global declined to comment on any of the claims in this article.  When the Guardian approached Global about the anonymous claims on social media about Westwood two years ago, it declined to comment and said it was 'of paramount importance' that the company was not quoted as having dismissed the anonymous accusations. Global was aware of the claims in 2020 because it had to apologise after the official Capital Xtra Twitter account blocked a number of individuals making allegations about Westwood's sexual behaviour - blaming an 'error of judgment' by Westwood's team, who had been handed control of the station's social media account. At the time Global's spokesperson would not say whether it was investigating allegations against Westwood, although it is understood the company had not received any formal complaints. A spokesperson for Westwood has denied all the allegations in the recent joint Guardian and BBC investigation and said the claims were completely false.", "aa0c3d293a1788a340808edcf3837276ec0960a30f2e541e8ded922e": "Scientists have identified specific groups of gut microbes that could increase or decrease someone's risk of suffering the most common type of stroke. The research, presented at the European Stroke Organisation Conference (ESOC) in Lyon, France, adds to growing evidence that alterations in the gut microbiome could play a role in cardiovascular disease. Previous studies have suggested that certain microbes may influence the formation of atherosclerotic plaques in the arteries, and that the gut microbiomes of stroke patients differ from those of healthy controls. To investigate whether they may also influence people's recovery from stroke, Dr Miquel Lledos from the Sant Pau Research Institute in Barcelona, Spain, and colleagues took stool samples from 89 people who had very recently suffered an ischaemic stroke (where a blood clot blocks the flow of oxygen to the brain), as well as from healthy individuals, and performed DNA sequencing to identify the different microorganisms present in their guts, and whether certain groups of bacteria correlated with their functional recovery. 'We identified new [bacterial] taxa associated with higher risk of stroke severity in the acute phase at six hours and at 24 hours,' Lledos said. 'We also identified one class, one genus, and one species related to poor functional outcomes at three months after ischaemic stroke. 'The discovery opens the exciting prospect that, in the future, we may be able to prevent strokes or improve neurological recovery by examining the gut microbiota. Nowadays, there are no specific neuroprotective treatments to prevent neurological worsening after stroke. The use of new therapies such as changes in the microbiome through nutritional changes or faecal transplantation could be useful to improve post-stroke evolution.' Meanwhile, separate research presented by Cyprien Rivier from Yale University in Connecticut, US, used a statistical technique called Mendelian randomisation to investigate whether the link between stroke risk and alterations in the gut microbiome is truly causal. They combined data from 2,300 participants involved in the Flemish Gut Flora Project, plus a further 34,000 people enrolled in a large study examining the role of genetics in stroke risk, looking at whether genes known to increase people's likelihood of harbouring specific microbial species influenced their risk of ischaemic stroke. Doing so identified 26 bacterial species that were significantly associated with stroke. 'Most of the bacteria we found are associated with lower risk, but five of them are associated with an increase in the risk of either ischaemic stroke or one of the subtypes of this type of stroke,' said Rivier. The next step will be to explore the mechanisms by which the presence or absence of certain species contributes to stroke risk. River said: 'Bacteria can release toxins into the blood, they can also produce certain proteins that interfere with physiological processes. There is also what we call the microbiota-gut-brain axis - a bidirectional pathway between the brain and the microbiome, whereby the brain is influencing the gut through the nerves, and the microbiome is in turn influencing the organs, including the brain, mainly through altering the blood pressure.'", "d3917e17849e0af9e52be9cb47356ff78929335b58c5d2387ec96cb3": "They were separated by thousands of miles and the two sets of builders could not conceivably have met or swapped notes, but intriguing parallels between Stonehenge and Japanese stone circles are to be highlighted in an exhibition at the monument on Salisbury Plain. The exhibition will show that ancient people in southern Britain and in Japan took great trouble to build stone circles, appear to have celebrated the passage of the sun and felt moved to come together for festivals or rituals. Circles of Stone: Stonehenge and Prehistoric Japan will flag up similarities between the monuments and settlements of the middle and late Jomon period in Japan and those built by the late neolithic people of southern Britain - and point out some of the differences. The exhibition will feature 80 striking objects, some of which have never before been seen outside Japan. Key loans announced on Wednesday include a flame pot, a highly decorated type of Jomon ceramics, its fantastical shape evoking blazing flames. Such pots were produced in Japan for a relative short period, perhaps only a few hundred years. Also featured will be fragments of dogu, clay figurines that have been found at Jomon settlements and stone circles and may have represented earth goddesses or spirits and been used in fertility or healing rituals. It is believed that many dogu were intentionally broken and scattered during ceremonies. Among the Japanese sites that will be in focus is that of the Oyu Stone Circles in northern Japan. It does not feature the sort of hulking standing stones that Stonehenge is famous for but rather two large circles made of thousands of river pebbles. The circles include small standing 'sundial' stones that align to the sun on midsummer daybreak. At Stonehenge on the longest day of the year, the sun's first rays shine into the heart of the monument. Dr Susan Greaney, a senior properties historian with English Heritage and a curator of Circles of Stone, said the Wiltshire and Japanese circles suggested a 'shared response' to their creators' environment and seasonal cycles. 'To understand the significance of Stonehenge, we have to understand what is happening elsewhere in the world in prehistory,' she said. 'Although there was obviously no contact between Japan and Britain at this time, there are surprising parallels.' Greaney said Jomon people and their neolithic counterparts in southern Britain shared the same sort of climate, topography and access to natural resources. Both were building stone circles aligned with the movements of the sun and took great care to remember their ancestors. Both peoples produced similar tools and pots and created settlements around important monuments. 'But there are also really interesting differences,' Greaney said. She argued it was not fair to say that because the Japanese produced more elaborate ceramics, they were more advanced - it could be, for instance, that it was taboo in neolithic Britain to make objects representing the human figure. Or that the ancient Britons had the upper hand because they were farmers, whereas those who built stone circles in Japan were fishers, hunters and gatherers. 'They are just different,' she said. Simon Kaner, the executive director of the Sainsbury Institute for the Study of Japanese Arts and Cultures, said he was excited to see precious objects from Japan being displayed at Stonehenge. 'This is an unprecedented opportunity to explore comparisons between Jomon Japan and neolithic Britain - separated by some 10,000km at either end of Eurasia, but sharing the desire to build monuments,' he said. Kaner said it was fascinating that no dogu-like figures had been found in southern Britain, with the nearest comparable ones discovered in south-east Europe. 'It may be that ceramic figures caught the imagination of the people in Japan but not here,' he said. 'Holding the exhibition at Stonehenge itself offers visitors the chance to reflect on common themes of what it means to be human, as well as difference, diversity and creativity in prehistory.'", "81894b4914d16191a674125b0628f8bf4ca35a851804f6176ce78f44": "A case has been filed against the government of Sierra Leone to overturn the country's loitering laws, which activists and lawyers claim are discriminatory, and used by police to extract bribes from people and sexually abuse women. The laws are used to target poor and vulnerable people, say critics, and to subject them to criminal sanctions for potential conduct rather than actual harm caused. Women arrested for loitering, and lacking money to pay bribes, have claimed they have been violently raped by police officers. Others say they have been coerced into having sex to avoid spending the night in a police cell. Loitering has been on the statute books since the days of British rule and is punishable by up to a month's imprisonment. It is a petty offence that is defined in the Public Order Act of 1965 and the Summary Conviction Offences Ordinance of 1906. Section 7 of the Public Order Act 1965 states that any person 'loitering in or about any stable house or building, or ... in the open air, and not having any visible means of subsistence, and not giving a good account of himself, shall be deemed an idle and disorderly person ... and be liable to imprisonment for any period, not exceeding one month'. Oludayo Fagbemi, senior legal officer at the Institute for Human Rights and Development in Africa (IHRDA), said that the laws discriminate against people on the grounds of social status: 'In lots of cases, it is poor people who get caught. People who sell things to club-goers, people who have to work late and walk home at night - they are arrested just because they are on the street.' The case, filed at the Ecowas court of justice in Nigeria on 21 April and brought jointly by the IHRDA and AdvocAid, a civil society organisation working with girls and women caught up in Sierra Leone's legal system, alleges that the laws violate provisions under the African Charter on Human and People's Rights, such as the right to equality and non-discrimination and the right to freedom of movement. 'This case is about the state's violation of the rights to freedom of movement, equality, and non-discrimination of poor Sierra Leoneans through laws that criminalise petty offences,' said Eleanor Thompson, a lawyer working on the case. 'It is truly about the criminalisation of poverty because the anti-loitering laws are used disproportionately against the poor and marginalised.' The government and police did not respond to a request for comment.", "03bd5d5965ccc392f74e5d557a414a34c1d42694287d0cf55c5436e1": "The first major study since Brexit of UK citizens living in the EU has revealed its profound impact on their lives, with many expressing serious concerns over their loss of free movement and voting rights - and a very different perception of Britain. The survey, of 1,328 British nationals across the continent, showed that if 'the public narrative suggests Brexit is done and dusted, it has brought deep transformations to the lives of British citizens in the EU and EEA', the study's co-lead, Michaela Benson, said. 'The long tail of Brexit is evident in its continuing impacts both on the way they live their lives, and in its lasting significance for their sense of identity and belonging,' said Benson, a sociology professor at Lancaster University. The survey, conducted between December 2021 and January 2022, a year after the end of the Brexit transition period, and part of a wider project by Lancaster and Birmingham universities, found 59% of respondents had lived in their country of residence for at least five years and most intended to stay. But many were angered by their loss of free movement, meaning they can no longer move within the EU for work, or retire to another EU country, and especially worried about being unable to return to the UK with non-British family members in future. Asked whether their past or future migration plans had been affected by Brexit, 27% of respondents said it had affected them a great deal, and 14% a lot. 'Where does one even start?' was the response of one British citizen living in Belgium. 'Loss of rights like freedom of movement around the EU and to the UK. With a wife who is an EU citizen, I had to decide whether to move to the relevant EU country or stay in the UK. Family now cannot move back to Britain. Uncertainty.' Another said: 'I moved to France in 2020 in order to protect my right to live and work in France post-Brexit. My migration is 100% a result of Brexit.' Brexit, and the British government's handling of the Covid pandemic, strongly affected 80% of respondents' feelings towards the UK, with responses including 'deep shame', 'disappointment', 'a shit show', 'embarrassed to be British', 'shambolic', and 'like watching a house on fire'. Just over 30% still felt very or extremely emotionally attached to the UK, compared with 75% who said they felt a very or extreme emotional attachment to the EU, and 59% who felt the same in relation to their country of residence. 'For me, one of the most interesting things the survey reveals is this sense of disappointment, shame and anguish over Brexit and the pandemic - and a really quite pronounced expression of European identity,' Benson said. About two-thirds had changed their legal status since 2016, acquiring residency or citizenship. But nearly half did not have the same status - and therefore the same migration and settlement rights - as some or all of their close family members. This was a major or significant concern for a large majority of respondents, who said it was affecting their own and their children's work, career and education, or would do so in the future. 'My wife is a Russian citizen,' said one respondent in Italy. 'Her right to live and work depend upon my status under the withdrawal agreement. She fears a potential move to another EU country as her residency rights are totally dependent upon mine.' Those who felt they may want or need to move back to the UK at some stage felt particularly affected, since non-British partners and other family members coming with them would now be subject to UK domestic immigration controls. 'I have a house in England,' said one respondent, who has lived in the Netherlands for 10 years. 'I was going to retire there. It's now being sold. My wife is Dutch. I do not think she could even relocate back to the UK - despite joint ownership of a house, having lived there for 15 years, being fluent in English and having two dual-nationality kids.' The loss of EU voting rights was also a big concern, with 46% saying they could no longer vote in European elections or, in most cases, local elections in their country of residence. Roughly 42% were also unable to vote in the UK because they had lived abroad for more than 15 years, although this is expected to change.", "62a7c9bbb398c36411191184d775b7d36a87a4ea129b9fc28604e836": "North Korea launched a suspected ballistic missile toward its eastern waters on Wednesday, South Korean and Japanese officials said, a few days after the North Korean ruler, Kim Jong-un, vowed to bolster his nuclear arsenal 'at the fastest possible pace' and threatened to use nuclear weapons against other countries. The launch, the North's 14th round of weapons firing, also came six days before a new South Korean president takes office for a single five-year term. South Korea's joint chiefs of staff said the launch was made off the North's eastern coast but gave no further details. Japan's defence ministry said North Korea fired a possible ballistic missile without providing further details. North Korea's quickened pace in weapons testing this year underscores its dual goal of advancing its missile programmes and applying pressure on Washington over a deepening freeze in nuclear negotiations, experts say. There are also signs that the North is preparing for a nuclear test at its remote north-eastern testing facility. Last week, Kim showcased his most powerful missiles during a massive military parade in capital, Pyongyang, where he vowed to develop his arsenal at the 'fastest possible pace' and warned that the North would proactively use its nuclear weapons if its national interests were threatened.", "1665c7b4b1a9eb65a2219c64778d43b6320c4c9968ef8e5e0244bccb": "", "8e40e6f722b4d1bdb4ec4a2689e98d42c134dbda5f29195747d3b1d4": "", "62ef0c9cc1955d550080ac515246aa55cd398d19a4f99f8c5979b379": "", "a03c4175cebe26cf328ee4580b9e3a315992ec3136a84057083422a3": "", "f47d703856a087a6287fc3eb07edaa63d408be5e5397113c4d9df3d3": "", "20d5d4e5579578c78469adbecfe42439a1f9ada90118bc7b036f8a0b": "", "523529851ac6e4d358830cad8959f33f37566837f97f5c80acf23825": "", "625613090a8da356d614bd6d87a7d81c73bf991aef692155ef322248": "", "5f1ff13a618d78c86d7363fcdb0ab235c1294be1ab37d5a518867e61": "", "12837c254f500ec2fe056aeb44c509565ef342eb6763ad836ebd6e27": "", "c2d63378e75f039698ab17711bd2c5440db2881f0b9b8983c6382b48": "Saima Hanif, 32, is one of Pakistan's frontline health workers, part of a network of volunteers and low-paid women who are key in the country's fight against polio. After 15 months of no reported cases, last week it was revealed that a 15-month-old boy had been paralysed by the polio virus in North Waziristan, bordering Afghanistan, where Hanif works. Here, she tells her story ... I was very happy that Pakistan reported no polio cases for more than a year, and I was hoping it would be among the countries that have eradicated polio completely. In Bangash colony, Rawalpindi, where I work, no virus was detected where it is measured - in sewage water for a year. Everyone was celebrating it as a victory. But sadly, after 15 months of having no polio, the case of the 15-month-old boy came as a huge shock. A few days ago, another case was reported. Our work will get tougher now. I'm a mother of two. I feel the pain of mothers whose children get affected by polio. There should be a healthy environment for children to grow in. There are parents who refuse polio drops for their children. I tell them I am a mother myself and that I have given them to my children before coming to give them to their children. I try to make them understand the importance - that if we want our children to stay healthy and end polio, then we should give drops. I tell them that the drops will prevent their children from being handicapped for life, and that every child has a right to a healthy life. You must not snatch their right away - we can only help your child if you cooperate. In my area, many parents refuse. A huge chunk of them have come from Afghanistan or from the tribal areas on the border, but it is not only those people who are conservative. A lot of times, parents hide their children when I come round. Some tell me that they never gave polio drops to their children in Afghanistan, so why should they do so here? I insist that it is for the child's betterment and would prevent them from a lifetime's misery. Some people tell me it is not allowed by Islam, and some even say things like, 'my child has stopped praying since you last administered polio drops'. There are a lot of myths around. I keep giving examples of my own children, and tell them if they are not praying it is not because of polio drops. Once, I went up many flights of stairs, and the parent refused, stating that the child was crying, although the child was nearby and calm. They did not let us in. Next day, we went back. I tried to convince them once again, but failed. We had to involve tribal and religious elders to convince them. Such incidents happen a lot. It becomes frustrating but we keep struggling to make Pakistan polio free. There is a lot more awareness now, and people are cooperating. But if cases emerge from even one place, then the virus may spread. Our work is scary and I don't feel safe at times. Polio workers have been killed, and the police who were guarding them. As a female worker, this job is more risky. We have to go to other people's homes, and a lot of times there are no women present so we have to be vigilant and alert. Sometimes, I ask my colleagues to stand outside and be alert while I go inside to give the drops. Some people don't allow us into their homes and scold us. They tell us to leave and talk rudely. But there are good people who give us so much respect. They ask if we want water and tell us 'you work in such hot weather. You people should come in and have some rest.'  Despite the fear, and the small amount frontline polio workers get (the equivalent of PS23 for a week-long campaign once or twice a month), we do our work. I think it is a great service to the country, but with inflation in Pakistan, we should be paid more. This new case is a huge setback, but I'm determined. If we continue fighting, there will come a day when Pakistan will be polio-free - not only for a year, but for eternity.' As told to Shah Meer Baloch in Rawalpindi.

Too weak to perch, the brownish-greyish songbird rested in a small towel twisted into a ring. He was the last of his species, the last in fact of an entire group of finches, and occurred nowhere on Earth outside his native Hawaii. For weeks, as scientists tried to find him a mate, he had been getting sicker. The only remaining po'ouli had just one eye. Alone in the towel, alone in all the world, he closed it. He was born, like all po'ouli (pronounced po-oh-oo-lee), in Maui's Hana rainforest, on the slopes of Mount Haleakala - 'house of the sun' - where it rains all the time. Also known as the blackfaced honeycreeper, his species was discovered in 1973. Then, researchers estimated the total population at 200 birds. Scholar Mary Kawena Pukui gave the bird its name, meaning 'black head'. Her book of Hawaiian proverbs includes this one: Hahai no ka ua i ka ulula`au, 'the rain follows the forest'. The phrase has a double meaning: it is a hint and warning. To find water, look for forests. But also: should one element of an ecosystem be destroyed, others will surely follow. By 1997, just five po'ouli remained. That year, on an unusually bright day, researchers caught one for the first time. It had taken Paul Baker, a British ecologist a long way from home, half of every month for two years. Climbing up and down Mount Haleakala's muddy hills meant that at just 33, he would soon need a knee operation. But it was worth it. After untangling the po'ouli from a mist net, Baker took the bird's measurements and charted its colours. The po'ouli weighed just 26.2g, or less than 1oz. The shades of his brown feathers alone included umber, raw sepia, ground colour sepia, warm sepia, sienna, antique brown, cinnamon, dark cinnamon, hair brown, mars brown, warm buff, olive brown, Prout's brown, Vandyke brown, Natal brown, Verona brown, army brown and dull brown-black. Holding the po'ouli in one hand, Baker photographed him with the other: the bird is seen upright and from the back, his head turned to the side, as though modelling a coat worn just off his shoulders. Baker released the po'ouli, but the bird stuck around. From a branch six feet away he looked at the man as if to say, 'Who are you? What have you just done? What are you?' Then the po'ouli flew off into the rainforest. What we know about how he and the rest of his species spent their time there is very little. They flew and foraged and slept through almost 500 inches of rain (12 times the average annual rainfall of New York state). The quietest of all Hawaiian honeycreepers, they rarely sang or chirped. They ate small land snails, beetles and butterfly larvae. But snails had been growing harder to find, thanks to European domestic pigs and black rats who disturbed the forest floor where birds foraged. The pigs, the rats, cats and mongoose who probably preyed on po'ouli and their eggs were all brought to the island decades earlier by humans, as were mosquitoes, which carry avian malaria. Invasive species have caused a third of the world's extinctions since 1500. Hawaii alone has lost two-thirds of its endemic bird species. By the new millennium, there were just three po'ouli left. Though they lived just a few kilometres from one another, they are unlikely ever to have met. Instead - perhaps out of loneliness, perhaps out of confusion - each spent time with yellowish, hook-beaked Maui parrotbills, which had a similar call. Meanwhile, conservationists, ornithologists and ecologists sent frantic emails, held tense meetings and pulled each other aside at conferences, fretting and fighting over what to do and who would pay for it. It took three years - or roughly a third of a po'ouli life - to reach a decision. In 2002, researchers captured what they hoped was a female. After feeding her two snails and 15 waxworms, they released her into the territory of what they believed was the last remaining male. The transplanted female embarked on her blind date at dusk. At dawn, she began to fly home, as unaware of the male po'ouli's existence as he was of hers. In 2004, the po'ouli got one last chance. It took six people 18 months and $300,000 to catch a bird. It was, remarkably, the same individual that Baker had snared seven years previously, when he became the first person to hold a live po'ouli. In that time, the bird had lost an eye. He was old - at least nine - and found captivity stressful. He died in Maui 11 weeks later, between 10pm and 11.30pm, on 26 November, of multiple (tiny) organ failure. He was the last po'ouli ever seen. Researchers hoping to catch a female could not find either of the remaining birds. In 2019, the International Union for Conservation of Nature declared the species extinct. 'When you get too involved with something like that, it can't help but sort of change you personally,' said Baker recently. His voice wobbled and he began to cry. 'I'm actually really upset right now, thinking about it,' he said. 'I remember the day I heard the bird had died and, stupid as it sounds, I wept for the species.' He sniffed. 'And I'm crying for it again now, all these years later.'", "1f8cc8d73d327267e9d10f2a713092c6385a8e5a652badf8e65103b6": "When Starbucks management came for Sean Andrews, it didn't surprise him, exactly. Tensions were already running high in the Denver coffee shop where he worked. A few days prior, Andrews' fellow baristas had walked off the job in a six-hour strike. They were demonstrating for their unionization effort and against what they saw as a sustained pattern of anti-labor tactics by Starbucks. Workers knew the strike was an escalation and expected retaliation. Even so, Andrews was unprepared when the Denver Starbucks district manager pulled him aside before a shift and asked him to take a call. The woman on the other end would eventually identify herself as a 'corporate investigator' who looks into losses in stores. After some innocuous questions about company policy, she began quizzing him about leftover food, according to a recording of the interaction obtained by the Guardian. Did his co-workers ever take any for themselves? Did he? After sticking to the company line at first, an audibly exasperated Andrews turned blunt. In the back of the store, there's a box for leftover food that goes to a local food pantry. If a piece of food was about to turn bad, or if a store item was expired and set to be thrown away, he or his co-workers would at times grab something on their way out, 'like every [barista] who works for Starbucks', he said. Cost of living has ballooned in Denver in recent years, with housing prices growing by 21% in the past year alone. The starting hourly salary for baristas is $16.37, according to a job posting from March (experienced employees can make more than $21 an hour). One of Andrews' co-workers was functionally homeless at the time, a fact that he shot back at the company investigator when she asked for the names of people who took food. (Several Starbucks employees interviewed for this story described regularly being behind on rent.) The investigator then asked if Andrews had a home. 'Yes,' he replied, 'no thanks to Starbucks.' At this point, the Starbucks investigator began grilling him, repeatedly demanding the identities of workers who took food, and demanding to know who was homeless. Andrews felt angry and uncomfortable. He refused to answer. 'I know exactly why you're doing this,' he said, referring to anti-union retaliation. Eventually, he stood up and announced that he quit. 'I will let all the other [baristas] know that this is happening,' he said to the investigator and his district manager. The investigator told him that if he did not leave immediately, his manager would call the police. Andrews' run-in with his bosses is a small part of an ongoing struggle between the world's largest coffee chain and thousands of its American workers. For years, unions had considered Starbucks notoriously difficult to organize. In December, workers at a Starbucks in Buffalo, New York, voted to form a union, the first in the history of the Seattle coffee chain. The victory broke the dam, and the subsequent flood has spread across the country. 'I was amazed that they were able to pull it off,' said Trey Slopsema, a Denver barista and an early organizer at the Denver store. 'And it really just stuck with me that this is something that we could actually do.' The union vote results for this Denver Starbucks will be announced on 10 May. This store is one of more than 200 locations with active union campaigns. More than 50 stores have successfully voted to unionize, including, in late April, one in the small town of Superior, Colorado, the first in the state. Taken along with the recent labor win at an Amazon warehouse - Amazon was another white whale for labor organizers - the Starbucks union push is part of a historic outpouring of worker activism in the US. But even in this context, the Denver union drive is notable. Buffalo, the site of the first Starbucks union win, has a strong labor culture and hundreds of local unions. By contrast, Colorado is a nominally liberal state that has trended Democratic in recent elections, but its union culture is noticeably weak. Colorado has a modified right-to-work law, which means that employees in unionized workplaces are not required to join the union. The state's rate of unionized workers is several points below the national average. At a basic level, Denver residents are far less likely to know a union member, or have been exposed to labor organizations, than in some other parts of the country. Colorado labor historians and union leaders described a pro-business, libertarian-tinged political climate that adds an extra degree of difficulty to an already hard process. 'If you go to Great Lakes cities, rust belt cities, there are old industries that still carry strong union identity,' said Nate Bernstein, healthcare director for United Food and Commercial Workers Local Number 7, which represents 23,000 grocery store and retail workers in Colorado and Wyoming. Denver's economic makeup, he said, is not conducive to union density. On top of that, Bernstein identified a cultural resistance to unions that stems from Denver's self-image as a 'cowboy town', where myths of rugged western individualism are dearly held. John Enyeart, a labor historian at Bucknell University, called this a common trope among western employers, one with little basis in historical fact. 'The mountain men worked together,' he said. 'It's hard to fight off a bear on one's own. The idea that they were doing this all individually is nonsense.' Corporations want you to think of the workplace as your family. For decades, American companies have often talked about their workplace in friendly terms. Workers are encouraged to trust their employer, to meld personal identity and professional occupation. Starbucks is part of this lineage. A press release on the company website from 2016 begins: 'Colleagues at work can sometimes feel like family.' The company has long referred to all their employees, from high-level management down to baristas, as 'partners'. In a video call leaked to the pro-labor news site More Perfect Union, Starbucks' CEO, Howard Schultz, recently told company managers that 'it's an American right of workers not to unionize and to embrace the values and the culture of his or her company'. Appeals of this sort to a sympathetic company culture have not always been the norm. In Colorado, the state's labor history recalls a time when the seesawing conflict between organized labor and corporate power was often confrontational - and sometimes violent. At the turn of the 20th century, the state's unions were strong and well organized across industries. More conservative craft unionists would go on strike with workers in other industries. And in the mines, the unions were radical, powerful and ready to fight. At the time, Colorado's economy relied on coal, gold and silver extracted from the Rocky Mountains. 'If you wanted to do any kind of work in a mining town like Cripple Creek - bartender, musician, anything - you had to be a union member,' said Thomas Andrews, a historian of the western United States at the University of Colorado. He also noted that these mining towns were often racially exclusive, with animus toward Mexican Americans and Chinese and eastern European immigrants running high among the unions. In this period, large and aggressive mining strikes were the norm at least once a decade, as miners went on strike for better working conditions, while the companies retaliated in often brutal fashion. In 1913, the United Mine Workers of America called a general strike in Colorado's coalfields, one that targeted the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company, the state's largest miner and owned by John D Rockefeller Jr. To break the strike, the company hired private guards to harass the workers and their families, who had gathered in a tent encampment in the town of Ludlow. On 20 April, the private soldiers, along with troops from the Colorado national guard, attacked the camp, killing at least 21 people, including 11 children. A 10-day war followed. Well-organized militias of striking miners - including many veterans of older mining conflicts - fought a guerrilla campaign against the Colorado national guard and the mining corporations, killing more people than died at Ludlow. The Ludlow Massacre became a pivotal moment in early 20th-century labor struggles. An investigation by Congress into mine safety conditions followed, and there was widespread outrage against the Rockefeller family. But labor's reputation suffered as well. Colorado newspapers turned against the unions, and business interests believed that the state's reputation needed to be restored. After the second world war, Colorado's economic path largely tracked that of the rest of the sun belt: huge investments of federal funds into the national highway system, technology and military infrastructure brought lifestyle-oriented, upper-class professionals to the state in droves. This economy endures today, with aerospace, telecommunications, financial services and tech driving the booming economy on Colorado's Front Range. None of these industries have strong union membership. This thin labor culture meant that some Denver Starbucks employees were unfamiliar with unions when the store's employees began organizing. Kelly Morris took a job at Starbucks six years ago to supplement her income as a preschool teacher, which did not cover groceries and rent. In that time, she had never considered the need for a union. Morris was born in Golden, a Denver suburb. Growing up, she didn't know any union members or have any personal connection to labor. She was not against unions, more that they weren't a part of her life. So when her co-workers began to discuss unionizing, Morris was hesitant. She didn't want to be fired and lose the healthcare she desperately needed. She wrestled with the idea for some weeks. But talking to her co-workers eventually convinced her. Morris signed a union card, as well as the initial letter to management announcing the staff's intention to unionize. Putting her name out there still makes her nervous, but Morris ultimately feels proud to stand with her co-workers. 'We need to have a say,' she told me. 'A union would give us that.' Enyeart, the Bucknell historian, drew a connection between the mine wars of the past and the struggles of Starbucks baristas today. '[Starbucks workers] are being intimidated and their livelihoods are being destroyed,' he said. Back then, Rockefeller knew he was never going to jail for violating labor laws that were on the books. The Starbucks people are doing the same thing. They know that, worst-case scenario, they have to pay some fines.' The Starbucks store where Andrews worked is on Colfax Avenue - the longest continuous commercial street in America. It offers a procession of taco counters, electronics stores, laundromats and several of Denver's famous theaters and music venues. The Starbucks store sits between an apartment complex and an addiction treatment center. It looks like a barn, and that's what locals call it. In the Denver Starbucks community, the Barn has something of a reputation. The pace is fast, with no space for inexperienced baristas. It's also notorious for being understaffed, and the clientele includes a fair share of unhoused people. These factors, according to multiple interviews with store baristas, make it so workers from suburban Denver locations virtually never pick up shifts at the store. ''Oh God, you work at the Barn,' that's not an uncommon thing to hear,' said Slopsema. But the store's isolation creates a distinctly close-knit team, he went on. When he turned 18, Slopsema wanted to travel around the country and used Starbucks to fund his wandering. He worked at stores in Indiana and Florida before moving to Colorado to see the mountains. The camaraderie at the Barn stands out. 'That's why I stick around. I've never worked with a team that's been so close.' This cohesion helped the store's team weather the pandemic. Many employees have been sick at various points in the past two years. Customers were often belligerent in response to mask mandates. Some were even violent. Last fall, Andrews was punched in the face so hard by an angry customer that his tooth chipped. Another employee, Michaela Sellaro, was pepper-sprayed in the face at the drive-thru window by a man upset that the store was out of mocha Frappuccinos. For a month after the incident, baristas would find shattered glass bottles littering the outside of their store in the morning. The man was throwing full Frappuccino bottles at the store in the night. According to Sellaro, Starbucks management was of little help. The bosses refused to allow workers to hang a picture of the man in the store, so baristas shared it among themselves. Sellaro noted that management did offer her a trauma counseling session in the back of the store. Overall, she said, 'I don't think they took it very seriously.' So when news of Buffalo's union win broke, employees at the Barn were immediately excited. Talk of the union benefits proposed in Buffalo consumed the group chat - better pay, workplace protections, a policy where, if the store is short-staffed, the other employees absorb the missing employees' pay for that shift rather than the company - as well as basic discussion of what unions are. The horizon of possibilities for their workplace had just expanded. After the Barn announced its union drive in January, high-ranking Denver Starbucks figures began to appear in the store, observing the baristas and nitpicking tiny infractions, like not wearing a name tag. According to several baristas, the store is chronically out of name tags, and refill requests often go ignored. Every barista sat through a one-on-one meeting with management over the course of three days in February. They were asked what they knew about the union and how they intended to vote. Companies cannot legally tell workers that they will lose benefits because of labor organizing. Instead, according to more than a half dozen Starbucks employees, managers made vague insinuations, stating that they could not promise that benefits would not get worse. 'If we have a union, we'll be doing the bargaining,' Sellaro said. 'Why would we argue for worse benefits?' There's a reason Sellaro's bosses homed in on benefit loss. Benefits are why many workers seek out Starbucks in the first place - and part of what has made organizing at the company historically difficult. Starbucks was the first large US corporation to offer healthcare benefits to part-time workers. Several workers at the Barn mentioned this as an incentive to stick with Starbucks. Most of them are in their 20s and 30s. Some have other service industry gigs. For many others, Starbucks is their only job. The company's college tuition aid program is 'the only reason' why Vanessa Castro has stuck with Starbucks for four years and three different stores, including a move to Portland and then back to her home state of Colorado. Her getting a communications degree from Arizona State University would not be possible otherwise, she told me in an interview at a park down the street from the Barn. 'If you start to empower employees by giving them benefits, options, resources to get success, you don't get to choose when to stop,' she said. The next step, for Castro, is a union. Shortly after the first union win in Buffalo, Schultz, Starbucks' well-known CEO, came out of retirement to lead the company again. The timing appears to be no accident. Schultz has a long history of opposing unions. In recent months, as the nationwide unionization campaign has gained momentum, Starbucks has deluged employees with anti-union messaging, fired pro-union workers and spent millions of dollars on a law firm famous for union-busting. It's unclear whether his advocacy is going well. At a recent event, Schultz promised workers that Starbucks would soon be getting into NFTs. In November, he made a shocking comparison between the company's benefit program and Jewish concentration camp prisoners sharing blankets during the Holocaust. At the same time, Schultz has argued that Starbucks can treat its employees well voluntarily, just without the presence of a union. Now he plans to do just that - and pit unionized workers against non-unionized ones. On 3 May, Starbucks announced immediate nationwide pay increases, with better sick time benefits and, for the first time, the option for customers to tip with their credit cards coming this fall. But in the fine print of the announcement, the company stated that the entire benefit expansion would apply to non-unionized stores only. On Twitter, the Starbucks Workers United union account claimed that pressure from the union campaign led to the raises. The union also stated that it has 'filed charges against Howard Schultz's threats that union stores won't receive these benefits'. At the Barn, loss of benefits became a concern in February and March, as workers who once had no trouble getting shifts found their hours abruptly cut - a strategy, most believed, meant to demoralize them or force them to quit so new employees could be hired and potentially change the union vote. Some of them relied on Starbucks for all of their income. Requests for more shifts went unheeded. Yet several shift supervisors - a role reserved for experienced baristas - describe being left with skeleton crews during busy times. Lillian Sanders, a shift supervisor who has worked in five Starbucks stores in three states over almost four years, called the tactics 'retaliatory' and 'purposefully isolating'. 'I've never had to work so hard to get my manager to answer her phone,' she said. Then there were the write-ups. In mid-February, Slopsema, a barista at the Barn, was given a final warning - the last step before being fired. The reason given was that the store safe was found unlocked after one of his shifts, as well as a failure to lock the store. According to Slopsema, the safe's latch was broken, an issue he raised with his bosses weeks before the incident. In a recording of a conversation about the warning obtained by the Guardian, Slopsema can be heard expressing shock at the severity of the punishment. 'I've never received a written warning before,' he said in the recording, 'so it's kind of upsetting to see that it's just a final right off the bat after working here for four years. He takes responsibility for leaving the store unlocked - he blames it on a mental lapse - but pushes back regarding the safe. 'I've also showed that the safe itself needs to be worked on,' he can be heard saying to his manager. 'It doesn't shut properly. Unless you really press on to it, it will just open back up, but I've already connected with you on that.' Two weeks later, Sellaro received her own final warning after she left her keys in her apron, hanging in the back, locked in the store overnight. Sellaro thought so little of her oversight with the keys that she subsequently mentioned it to her boss. Nothing happened for more than two weeks, at which point she was informed that she was one step from being terminated. Below a final warning are two less severe disciplinary levels. Both she and Slopsema had worked at Starbucks for years and never been written up for any infraction (Andrews now suspects that his encounter with the company investigator would have led to a final warning had he not quit on the spot). Both were known to be leading union advocates. Sellaro called it intimidation. 'If it was so egregious, why didn't you say something to me sooner?' she said. After baristas at the Barn went on strike in early March, messages from the company became more direct. 'Please vote and vote NO,' read a letter distributed to employees. Another letter from around that time accused the workers and their supporters of physically intimidating and yelling obscenities at customers during the walkout and strike. The letter urged employees to vote against the union. It was signed by Andrea Streedain, Starbucks' regional vice-president for the mountain west. In an internal company video call for store managers that recently leaked, the Denver district manager, Kaylin Driscoll, can be seen tearfully recounting these allegations against the striking workers. 'We watched everything we know about Starbucks and our culture erode,' she said. (Driscoll was the manager in the room when Andrews was questioned by the investigator. The Guardian called and left voicemails requesting comment with both Driscoll and Streedain. The company did not respond to a list of questions by press time.) Multiple workers who participated in the strike called allegations of physical intimidation a lie, though they acknowledge booing cars that broke the picket line to use the drive through. 'We behaved as if we were on the clock,' Sellaro said. Several recalled irate customers screaming at the demonstrators. Someone threw an egg at them from a nearby building. In the staff group chat, one worker described the letter as 'pure propaganda'. On 20 April, Starbucks' lawyers filed a complaint to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) against Starbucks Workers United (SBWU is an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union, which represents millions of workers across multiple sectors), one that specifically cites the March walkout at the Barn. It mentions the alleged yelling at customers and physical intimidation, according to CNBC. With less than a week before the results of the vote are announced, there has been serious attrition among the Barn's leading union voices. Andrews had quit after his encounter with the Starbucks investigator. Sanders gave her two weeks notice in early April, along with two other baristas. She described feeling 'forced out' by a difficult and intentionally unhelpful management. And Slopsema was finally terminated. (He declined to discuss the details of his dismissal, but several co-workers described the firing as not justified.) At least four unfair labor practice complaints had been filed to the NLRB on behalf of employees at the Barn, to go with dozens from other locations around the US, alleging anti-union activities of many kinds. Despite - and perhaps in response to - this pressure campaign, several workers said they are confident in the results of the vote. Corporate higher-ups continue to make regular appearances in the store. Sellaro said that the short-staffing persists. At least eight employees have quit or been fired in recent months, several in response to Slopsema's dismissal. The store has been forced to close early several times, angering some customers. 'We're consistently being staffed as thinly as humanly possible,' Sellaro said in a late April phone interview. She suspects the goal is to create resentment among the staff, but said the tactic had backfired. 'The way we've been abandoned by leadership, the way they leave us to flounder, and don't seem to understand how exhausting that is - [co-workers] keep saying that they are excited to have their own voice.' I spoke to Sellaro by phone on the day she mailed in her ballot. It was a proud moment, almost three months to the day since she and her co-workers publicly announced their intent to unionize. But the recent months have tainted her relationship to Starbucks, her main source of income. She feels scrutinized, like her bosses are looking for a chance to fire her. She has had panic attacks before some shifts. Longtime work friends have quit or been fired. She can't help feeling sad for her co-workers who began organizing with her, but will not be there at the end. 'We slogged through the, excuse my language, extremely shitty moments together, and now we're getting those little joyous moments,' she said. 'I can't imagine how hard it is for Trey [Slopsema] and Sean [Andrews] and Lillian [Sanders] and everyone else to see us celebrating and not be able to fully share in it. Bittersweet is the only way to describe it.'", "bd2cc9637dfdac5081925c52e844f370d7a2dc10fa7dfce86119f36a": "", "52e6f58c7f5ab6fa144004f08f52d5cf1a99fba05555c00b2aa11ed8": "Russia has accused Israel of supporting the 'neo-Nazi regime' in Kyiv as it escalates a diplomatic row with one of the few close US allies that decided not to join in sanctions against the Kremlin or send lethal military aid to Ukraine. The dispute over remarks by Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, who said in an interview that Adolf Hitler 'had Jewish blood' and that the 'most rabid antisemites tend to be Jews', has threatened to unsettle Israel's careful position over Russia's war in Ukraine. On Monday, Israel summoned Russia's ambassador to the foreign ministry and its foreign minister, Yair Lapid, called Lavrov's remarks 'unforgivable and outrageous ... as well as a terrible historical error.' Lapid wrote: 'Jews did not murder themselves in the Holocaust. The lowest level of racism against Jews is to accuse Jews themselves of antisemitism.' On Tuesday, Russia's foreign ministry doubled down on Lavrov's words, accusing Lapid of making 'antihistorical' remarks about the Holocaust that 'largely explain the course of the current Israeli government in supporting the neo-Nazi regime in Kyiv. 'Unfortunately, history knows tragic examples of Jewish cooperation with the Nazis,' the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement. The Hitler comments appear to have added to the pressure for Israel to abandon its attempts to maintain a neutral stance on the Russian war in Ukraine, a position that has angered its US allies. Since the war broke out, Israel has set up a field hospital in western Ukraine, provided humanitarian supplies, and protective vests and helmets for the Ukrainian army. It has so far refrained from sending more substantial military aid or imposing sanctions on Russia. Israel has a delicate relationship with Russia, as both have military interests in Syria. As the conflict drags on and more evidence of atrocities committed by Russian forces against civilians has come to light, Israeli criticism has become more vocal, with Lapid last month accusing Russia of war crimes. In an interview with Ynet published on Monday evening, he said of his counterpart's allegations: 'That angers me not only as foreign minister but also as the son of my father, who was in the ghetto in Budapest. It wasn't Jews who put him in the ghetto. The Nazis put him there. The Nazis persecuted the Jews and killed 6 million Jews. The Ukrainians aren't Nazis, only the Nazis were Nazis.' The Israeli daily Haaretz reported on Tuesday that military and political establishments were considering bolstering assistance to Ukraine in the wake of the diplomatic row. The list of items that can be sent to Ukraine will be reviewed in the next few days, the newspaper said. But according to a quoted source in the Haaretz report, Israel will shy away from sending advanced weaponry or defensive technology, such as the missile defence systems President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has asked the Knesset to supply. New shipments of military equipment are likely to be 'symbolic', the source said, in keeping with Israel's existing policy of avoiding antagonising Moscow. Little has surfaced of what was discussed during Monday's almost unprecedented summoning of the Russian ambassador, Anatoly Viktorov, for a clarification meeting on Lavrov's incendiary comments. 'The Israeli position was made clear in the meeting and the parties agreed that no further details would be published,' an unnamed official told local media on Tuesday, in what appeared to be an attempt to let the matter lie. Israel's western allies have been pressuring the country to increase its support for Ukraine since the war broke out in February. Officials are also reportedly worried that Israel's continued balancing act between Russia and the west could hurt the arms industry by sending the signal that Israel could also sit out future conflicts. Analysts said Lavrov's inflammatory remarks, which threatened to antagonise one of the few western countries still willing to engage with Russia, were indicative of the 'radicalisation' of much of the Russian government and the lack of coherency to its goals in Ukraine. 'Diplomacy as a skill, as an art collapsed with everything else on February 24th,' said Alexander Baunov, a Russian political analyst who previously served as a diplomat. There are 'no rules, no skills, no rationality ... nothing is as usual. They are all disoriented in this new world, including people like Lavrov, Putin himself, they don't know how to speak, what is allowed and what is not. 'They are concentrated on one task which is to justify the thing they have done which is not going as is expected,' he said, referring to the invasion of Ukraine. 'And they still have to justify it.'", "33b7e1c4bb5674addedce975802cf131959dc2d3a4e4acd6f83e3d02": "A 12-year-old orphan from Mariupol, who ended up in Russian-controlled Donetsk after being injured in a blast that killed her father, has been discharged from a children's hospital in Kyiv to start a new life after being reunited with her grandfather. It is, perhaps, the end of the beginning of the suffering Kira Obedinsky has endured over the last two months. Before leaving the hospital on Tuesday, she was visited by Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who gave her an iPad. It was a moment, said Alexsandr Obedinsky, 67, that his young granddaughter will treasure for ever. 'She couldn't believe it was happening to her. All of us need positive emotions now, and so does Kira.' Much of Kira's life in the last two months has been barely believable. In the early weeks of Vladimir Putin's 'special military operation', Kira had been sheltering with her father, Evgeny, and his partner, Anya, and her children, in the basement of a neighbour's house in Mariupol. The building was hit directly, and while Kira and the others were dragged from the rubble by rescuers, Evgeny did not survive, leaving the young girl, whose mother died two weeks after her birth, an orphan. In the days after, Anya decided she had to try to get Kira and the other children out of Mariupol, but as the group walked through the debris of the shattered city, one of them stood on a mine. In the subsequent chaos, Kira ended up in the hands of Russian soldiers who took her, bleeding from shrapnel wounds to the face and body, to Donetsk's regional hospital in a separatist-controlled part of the Donbas region. In the coming weeks, Kira even featured on Russian state television as an example of a Ukrainian civilian who was being well treated. Alexsandr received a video call from her that provided relief, but also anxiety, as reports were emerging of Ukrainian civilians being forcibly taken to Russia. The Guardian highlighted Kira's plight in early April and a week later Ukraine's deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk called Alexsandr on his mobile phone. 'I mean, I was trying hard, searching for someone who could help me, Ukrainian authorities and everyone I could reach,' Alexsandr said. 'I knocked on all doors, the Red Cross, our government, anyone.' He went on: 'Iryna Vereshchuk called me on 15 April and told me it was possible to get Kira back, but to do so I had to go to Donetsk. She asked if I was ready to do it, with safety guarantees from President Zelenskiy. I said I was ready and they took me.' Alexsandr arrived in Kyiv on 17 April to discuss logistics. 'Then we went to Poland, from Poland to Turkey, from Turkey to Rostov in Russia and then from Rostov to Donetsk People's Republic, I mean, to Donetsk,' he said. 'We spent the night there and in the morning they took me to meet Kira. There was another woman with me. She also came to take back her grandson.' Recalling the moment he saw Kira, looking healthy in jeans and a sweater, Alexsandr said: 'We were very emotional, both of us.' The reunited pair took the same route back to Kyiv, arriving on 26 April. Kira was then admitted to Ohmatdyt children's hospital where Zelenskiy made a surprise visit and gave her his gift. Alexsandr has not talked to Kira about the death of her father. 'She doesn't like taking about that, and I also don't want to discuss unnecessarily,' he said. 'Psychotherapists are working with her. She is OK considering what she lived through.' For now, the future is the focus. 'Yes, I adopted her and I'm her official guardian now, so she'll live with me, we'll be together,' Alexsandr said. 'We'll stay in Chernivtsi [a city in south-western Ukraine] for now, and I don't know what [the] future holds for us. We'll see how life turns out.'", "3bafc5eadb8681ddfa6e364c5d29e42e02013029d9f1e3da3ff27a4d": "The aim of EU sanctions is to 'break the Russian war machine', with measures on Kremlin oil now imminent, the president of the European Council has said, as Germany pivoted to back the move. A proposal to phase in a prohibition on Russian oil imports will be discussed by member state ambassadors in Brussels on Wednesday, with the most dependent, such as Slovakia and Hungary, seeking exemptions. Those championing the ban have been bolstered by a change in approach in Germany, where reliance on Russian oil has been reduced from 35% at the end of last year to 12%. The German economics minister, Robert Habeck, has called on EU member states to show 'solidarity with Ukraine' and 'do their bit'. Speaking at the opening of a new liquefied natural gas terminal in the Greek port of Alexandroupolis, the head of the European Council, Charles Michel, who chairs meetings of EU leaders, said the war in Ukraine was a 'moment of urgency, a moment of truth'. He said: 'Our goal is simple: we must break the Russian war machine. And I am confident that the council will imminently impose further sanctions, notably on Russian oil.' The European Commission will send its proposals on a phased-in ban on Russian oil imports to the capitals on Tuesday evening ahead of a speech on Wednesday by the commission's president, Ursula von der Leyen, in which she will lay out the details to the European parliament. Russia accounts for about 25% of oil imports to the EU, although the level of dependency varies between member states. The German government signalled at the weekend that it believed it could completely phase out its use 'by the late summer'. Slovakia's economics minister, Richard Sulik, said on Tuesday, however, that his country's dependence on oil from the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline meant it would not be able to end the flow of oil for several years. 'We will insist on the exemption, for sure,' he said. Slovakia has said it needs between four and six years to convert its oil refineries to process crude from other sources, although the commission is said to consider this phase-out period as too long. Hungary's foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, said Budapest could not support sanctions 'that will make the transport of natural gas or oil from Russia to Hungary impossible'. 'The point is simple: that Hungary's energy supply cannot be endangered, because no one can expect us to allow the price of the war [in Ukraine] to be paid by Hungarians,' he said. 'It is currently physically impossible for Hungary and its economy to function without Russian oil.' As well as Slovakia and Hungary, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic are highly dependent on the flow of oil from Russia. The comments from Budapest and Bratislava reflect a desire to maximise their leverage going into the internal discussions. The latest proposed sanctions will need unanimous approval to become the sixth wave of restrictive measures applied to the Russian economy since the war in Ukraine began on 24 February. The measures are the most politically sensitive yet, with officials fearing that a sudden increase in oil prices could lead to soaring prices at petrol pumps, triggering protests. During a two-hour phone call with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, Russia's president said EU sanctions were fuelling a problem with food supply in Europe. Putin also claimed that 'despite Kyiv's inconsistency and its lack of readiness for serious work, the Russian side is still ready for dialogue'. The commission is expected to propose a gradual phasing-out of Russian oil over six to nine months, with certain countries permitted extra time and offered alternative supply from other member states. Poland and the Baltic states, some of Ukraine's strongest allies in the EU, want an immediate ban but this position has not gained traction. Meanwhile, the European commissioner for energy, Kadri Simson, said she would present a plan later this month for how the EU could replace two-thirds of its use of Russian gas by the end of 2022. Speaking in the European parliament, Simson said the EU's executive branch was exploring how to hasten the transition from gas to renewable energy. On Monday, she had warned that a large number of European energy companies faced a decision in mid-May on whether to breach EU sanctions by paying their Russian bills in roubles as demanded by Vladimir Putin or potentially losing supply. In a speech to the European parliament, Italy's prime minister, Mario Draghi, hinted at his government's concerns given its reliance on Russian gas. 'We can't simply support sanctions,' he said. 'We need to ensure that we can achieve independence from Russian gas ... At the same time, we need to find solutions to protect families and businesses from increased energy costs.' It emerged in a quarterly financial report on Tuesday that Uniper remains in talks with Berlin and the Russian supplier Gazprom over how to deal with the situation. Uniper, Germany's largest importer of Russian gas, declined to comment on details of the talks, saying only that no binding assessment had been made.", "406d2391ed9cd58e167c4780f565fab2a12f85006f1ff153ea408132": "On a dusty field on the east side of Mexico's sprawling capital, about 500 Ukrainian refugees are waiting in large tents under a searing sun for the United States government to tell them they can come. The camp has only been open a week and 50 to 100 people are arriving every day. Some have already been to the US border in Tijuana where they were told they would no longer be admitted. Others arrived at airports in Mexico City or Cancun, anywhere they could find a ticket from Europe. 'We are asking the US government to process faster,' said Anastasiya Polo, co-founder of United with Ukraine, a non-governmental organization, that collaborated with the Mexican government to establish the camp. She said that after a week's time none of the refugees there 'are even close to the end of the program'. The program, Uniting for Ukraine, was announced by the US government on 21 April. Four days later, Ukrainians showing up at the US-Mexico border were no longer exempted from a pandemic-related rule that has been used to quickly expel migrants without an opportunity to seek asylum for the past two years. Instead, they would have to apply from Europe or other countries such as Mexico. To qualify people must have been in Ukraine as of 11 February; have a sponsor, which could be family or an organization; meet vaccination and other public health requirements; and pass background checks. Polo said US government officials had told her it should take a week to process people, but it appeared like it was just beginning. Some of the first arrivals had received emails from the US government acknowledging they received their documents and the documents of their sponsors, but she had heard of no sponsors being approved yet. 'These people cannot stay in this camp, because it is temporary,' Polo said. More than 100 of the camp's residents are children. Nearly 5.5 million Ukrainians, mostly women and children, have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded its smaller neighbor on 24 February, according to the UN high commissioner for refugees. Giorgi Mikaberidze, 19, is among the waiting. He arrived in Tijuana 25 April and found the US border closed. He complained that the U.S. government had given so little notice, because many people like himself were already in transit. He went from being just yards from the United States to about 600 miles (966km) now. When the US government announced in late March that it would accept up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, hundreds entered Mexico daily as tourists in Mexico City or Cancun and flew to Tijuana to wait for a few days - eventually only a few hours - to be admitted to the US at a San Diego border crossing on humanitarian parole. A wait of two to four days was eventually shortened to a few hours as US border inspectors whisked Ukrainians in. That special treatment ended the day Mikaberidze arrived in Tijuana. 'We want to go to America because [we're] already here, some don't have even money to go back,' he said. Mikaberidze was visiting relatives in Georgia, south of Ukraine, when the Russian invasion occurred and was not able to return. His mother remains in their village near Kharkhiv in eastern Ukraine, afraid to leave her home because Russian troops indiscriminately shoot up cars traveling in the area, he said. 'She said it's a very dangerous situation,' said Mikaberidze, who traveled to Mexico alone. The Mexico City camp provides a safe place to wait. It was erected inside a large sports complex, so Ukrainians could be seen pushing strollers with children along sidewalks, playing soccer and volleyball, even swimming. However, the refugees have been warned that while they are free to leave the complex, no one is responsible for their safety. Iztapalapa, the capital's most populated borough, is also one of its most dangerous.", "6f59fcff152ce6b7433190048393253b8d1231f8235f12d803a19db7": "Russia's invasion of Ukraine is inflicting damage to the country's infrastructure at a cost of $4.5bn (PS3.6bn) a week as bombs tear through thousands of buildings and public utilities, and miles of road. According to estimates compiled by the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE), and supported by the Ukrainian government, the total amount of direct infrastructure damage has reached $92bn since Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion in February. Academics said the figure rose by almost $4.5bn in the week to 2 May, adding that their estimate is probably lower than the true cost because losses from the war are hard to quantify. With losses since the invasion having risen to about 60% of annual economic output, the researchers said Ukraine was suffering heavy damage to infrastructure that will be expensive to repair or rebuild. The KSE said its project, Russia Will Pay, was based on analysis of thousands of reports of damage caused during the invasion, which have been submitted by citizens, government agencies and local authorities. The snapshot showed that the bulk of the infrastructure costs relate to bomb damage inflicted on buildings, roads, factories and businesses, based on the open-source data project to track the cost of the war. More than 33.7 million sq metres of residential buildings have been hit by missiles, bombs and suffered other damage during the war, worth almost $30bn in total. More than 23,000km of road have been ripped up or pockmarked by shelling, and almost 90,000 cars, worth billions of dollars combined, have been damaged. The KSE said the overall economic costs of the war - when damage to infrastructure is taken with the impact on GDP, the cessation of investments and the outflow of workers as millions flee the country - could rise to $600bn, almost four times the value of annual GDP. The figures compare with estimates made by the World Bank in mid-April, which suggested that physical infrastructure worth about $60bn had been damaged, a figure that was expected to continue rising. Last month, the International Monetary Fund said Ukraine's economy would probably contract by about 35% this year, while the loss of life, destruction of infrastructure and exodus of workers would severely impede its economy for many years to come, even if the war ended soon. Boris Johnson, who addressed the Ukrainian parliament on Tuesday, suggested in March that Ukraine might need a 'new Marshall plan', referring to the US aid package used after the second world war to help rebuild the economies of Europe. The IMF has provided $1.4bn in emergency financing to help meet Ukraine's immediate spending needs, while the World Bank is mobilising financial support worth about $2.5bn.", "7eae42bb04dcea016d6ec391502641125cdb0dbe23925f8bc1d63def": "Jacinda Ardern's Labour party is continuing to slump in popularity, as New Zealand reckons with a worsening cost of living crisis. New polling found the centre-right National party leads Labour although a Labour-led coalition would still have a strong chance at government. The Newshub-Reid research poll put Labour down 6.1 points to 38.2% since its last poll in February, and National up 9.2 points to 40.5%. Ardern's personal popularity had also dropped 7%, to 36.3%. While still behind Ardern, National leader Christopher Luxon had risen in the preferred prime minister stakes at 23.9%, an increase of 6.1%. It marks Ardern's lowest result in the Reid poll since she became prime minister in 2017, and the best result for a National leader since before that election. The latest poll is in line with other results earlier in the year. In March, a TVNZ/Kantor poll found National had overtaken Labour - albeit by a smaller margin - for the first time since the pandemic began. Those results mark a return to business-as-usual for New Zealand, which has typically relied on the development of multiparty coalition governments rather than single-party rule. The last election, in which Labour won a large enough chunk of the vote to govern alone, was a departure from the norm - driven by Ardern's personal popularity, and huge support for the government's Covid-19 response. Now, New Zealand's attention has turned from the Covid response to the growing challenges of inflation and the cost of living. In April, annual inflation reached a 30-year high of 6.9%, and in March, food prices were 7.6% higher compared with a year prior. Despite government tax relief on petrol, prices at the pump have been driven up by the flow-on effects of the war in Ukraine. The cost of housing and renting remains a concern, with median rents up 7% year on year, while high prices continuing to lock many first-time buyers out of the housing market. Ardern told Newshub that the results reflected a difficult time for the country. 'It has been a really difficult period for New Zealand and then of course, by default, that makes it a difficult period to govern through,' she said. 'There will be from time to time tough decisions that need to be made and if that means that we take a bit of a hit in the numbers, so long as we stand by all of the decisions we've made - and we do - then that's a price we're willing to pay.' National party leader Christopher Luxon, who took the party's helm this year, told the New Zealand Herald the results were a result of broad dissatisfaction from New Zealanders. 'Why it's happening is the public is just feeling that it's a government that's all spin and no delivery and it doesn't get things done,' he said. Under the current numbers, both major parties would be courting coalition options beyond their traditional partners. On the right, the libertarian Act party is sitting at 6.4%, and on the left, the Greens at 8.4%. If the election were to take place tomorrow, that would place the left and right blocks neck and neck, with neither able to form a government with just one coalition partner. Both would be looking to Te Pati Maori - the Maori party - to get them over the edge, with its 2.5%. The next election must be held before January 2024.", "5303ab05b9ac2a1913b5829e2dabb66d35fe35f5b66fb94265ad7330": "", "668398c19b415ddc2fa65ddf626bb2b4b9bdd8cc940743ead40e11f0": "", "01cb66f4a75aeca9289bf525b997e3149783b91af8f35087dec1f79a": "", "ff28209cb63a2267e191c7339795d324de69e7fc37560536f50dbd48": "", "d49327bf6c977d0f697e2be225870d9a789d83657fcc25d2c2323331": "", "f761570a5a4c89ece994f5677e0edf2738d18da0dc32a10a481fbde1": "", "796b7d7b12ca730838420f2a95ac4083c79ecae82a2f264613d8967c": "", "15f8216d05c34e79ea875356444170a19fcafd8bf18e0a3758e3d75a": "", "e83dc79084298bd2889665fa964fce7de0c4f48e17454802d81c4067": "", "d95e8b76acbc8775ad8d67460e6370d24e1ebe9c4f824b05a130a0e7": "", "3635ae3e617f60d30ce69ba80d7e44864d3fbcc3455be55ca81ce9f0": "", "aaf69020ae3d28efd6ce4adb9c4aee78dd66c18cdad75fd4a5f56cd1": "", "b29d24d1eaaffb4ab89094b828933ff7330f2f5a81b02214f0292dff": "", "4fb8d27c193ab9d2678be0d45f26ba83b4f931d9148cca1d183da321": "", "09c1fb0f4b719e06e8a9df67800f6896e534e900224df9e2ddb6cb79": "When a string of mysterious explosions hit government buildings in Transnistria, the Moscow-backed separatist region of Moldova, there was no immediate claim of responsibility. But for Pasha, a 24-year old journalist from the breakaway region's capital, Tiraspol, this week's blasts were a clear sign that it was time to get out. 'There was a chance that there would be more attacks, and it's no fun waiting to find out where would be hit next,' he said. Adding to the uncertainty were growing rumours that men in the region would be mobilised to fight alongside Russian troops across the border in Ukraine. So Pasha, his mother and his friend, fellow journalist Maxim, 23, packed their essentials and drove to the Moldovan capital, Chisinau, where they are staying with relatives. They are hoping to return home, but other friends who left Transnistria have already fled to Turkey, Poland or the Czech Republic. With a population of 470,000 people, Transnistria is a predominantly Russian-speaking sliver of land wedged between the Nistru River and the Ukraine border. A year after Moldova declared independence from the Soviet Union, the region broke away in 1992 after a five-month war in which Russian forces (and Crimean Cossacks) intervened on the side of the separatists. No country, not even Russia, has recognised the self-declared Transnistrian Moldovan Republic, but the 'frozen conflict' has kept Moldova partitioned ever since. Now, many fear that last week's explosions may herald a dangerous thaw. On Monday, government buildings in Tiraspol were hit by what appeared to be rocket-propelled grenades. In the following days, blasts hit a radio tower broadcasting in Russian, and shots were reportedly fired near a Russian arms depot. Separatist authorities in Tiraspol blamed the incidents on Ukrainian infiltrators. Kyiv has accused Russia of launching the attacks to further destabilise the region, while Moscow denounced them as 'acts of terror'. Meanwhile, Moldova's pro-EU president, Maia Sandu, blamed the blasts on infighting between rival factions in Transnistria. But the uncertainty has prompted growing concern that Moldova could be dragged into the Ukraine conflict. Moscow has long used Transnistria as a bargaining chip in its efforts to influence Moldova. The region still hosts 1,500 Russian troops, as well as 20,000 tonnes of ammunition stored in Cobasna, the largest ammunition depot in eastern Europe. Among last week's incidents were shootings a mile away from Cobasna, according to the Transnistrian authorities. Moldovan government sources fear that if the depot blew up it could result in an explosion 10 times bigger than the 2020 Beirut blast, where more than 2,000 tonnes of explosive material was stored. Despite its frail economy, Moldova has already received about 95,000 people fleeing the war in Ukraine, a figure equivalent to 3.5% of its population, according to the Moldovan foreign ministry. The events of the past week are prompting many refugees to consider fleeing once again. 'If war comes to Transnistria, I will leave, probably for Germany,' said Lyuda, 35, an accountant and single mother who fled Mariupol in March and is now working for the UNHCR mission in Moldova. Security has been stepped up on the Transnistrian side of the border, causing long queues of traffic, but at the Moldovan checkpoints down the road, security forces simply wave vehicles through. Moldova's government has pledged to step up security, but for now life goes on as usual in Chisinau. In Valea Morilor park, joggers make laps around the lake, anglers cast their lines and the loudest sound is the voice of a canoe coach training her students. Across the city, Chisinau's central market is packed with people buying food and offerings for the upcoming Pastele Blajinilor, Moldova's holiday commemorating the dead. But even here, there is an edge of uncertainty. Alex, a stallholder in the market had just come off a call with a cousin in Italy who he was thinking of joining, he said. 'I have a wife and a baby, and I don't feel safe here,' he said. Inside Transnistria, separatist authorities have kept quiet about the war raging in Ukraine. 'Transnistria's leaders are being cautious,' said the Moldovan journalist Alina Radu. 'They are not cheering on the war, but nor are they criticising Russia's military aggression.' Since the death of its Soviet-era industry, Transnistria's economy has been dominated by a small elite. Russia provides Transnistria with free gas, which gives businesses in the region a competitive advantage over Moldovan businesses. Its largest conglomerate, which controls everything from petrol stations to a cognac distillery - and the football club FC Sheriff - was co-founded by the former KGB agent Victor Gusan, who also has a Ukrainian passport and owns property in Kyiv. 'Transnistrian leaders are under a lot of pressure,' said the Moldovan journalist Alina Radu. 'For the first time, they are isolated. Both Moldova and Ukraine have governments that are not pro-Russian. Transnistrian elites have two options: to follow the orders of Putin, the most terrible dictator today, or to have a prosperous future with Europe.' Analysts in Chisinau warn that Russian security and propaganda networks are spreading. A recent report from the Royal United Services Institute, said Russian spy agency the FSB aimed 'to destabilise Moldova to tie down Ukrainian forces on the southern border, to counter growing pro-European sentiment in the country, and to show the west that support for Ukraine risks wider consequences, including in the Balkans'. Valeriu Pasa, from the Moldovan thinktank Watchdog said that Moscow had overestimated vestigial pro-Moscow sentiment in the country.  'Russia's aim is to create tension,' he said, pointing to debunked viral reports that Romanian troops had been deployed near the border with Moldova. But Moldova, with a population of just 2.5 million, has already suffered from mass emigration, and such pressures still had the potential to cause more harm, said Radu. 'I am afraid that the tension might generate yet another harmful wave of emigration - just as the government has been trying to bring back the diaspora.'", "e60013985affd445ccdb82c535b448c44c2ba49c501dc78b6bc369d5": "I am not exactly sure where my fascination and love of trees came from, but I do remember from a very young age seeing fallen acorns under a huge oak tree and being told that this tree had produced all of these acorns and that each one, like the one I had picked up and was holding in my hand, could grow into an oak tree and be hundreds of years old. After spending a lifetime working with trees, they continue to amaze me with their ability to grow and adapt through decades, and in many cases centuries, of seasonal change. Recently we've discovered their mechanism for communicating with each other below ground, which has become known as the wood wide web. The web is most active and thrives in areas of unworked woodlands (1) and forests, such as ancient woods, where the soil has been left undisturbed for centuries. This has led to an extensive underground network, linking trees in a forest together, young and old, helping them flourish as one giant superorganism. They share nutrients and even warn each other of attacks from pests. From my childhood days, the majestic oak has remained one of my favourite trees. After the yew, they are the longest living of our native British trees, living up to and occasionally more than 1,000 years, supporting the highest associated biodiversity, hosting hundreds of species of moths, butterflies, other insects, birds and mammals, as well as ferns, fungi, lichens and mosses (2). The total is higher than that of any other tree species in Britain. With oaks there continues to be life after death. Ancient oaks are brilliant as deadwood habitat, providing a niche for some specialist invertebrates that are rare and endangered and can only live on ancient decaying oak. We have two native species: the sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and the English or pedunculate oak (Quercus robur). The leaf stalks on the pedunculate oak are very short, less than half a centimetre, whereas the leaf stalks of the sessile oak are 1cm-2cm long. This is the opposite with their fruits (acorns): stalks on the pedunculate oak may be as long as 10cm, while on the sessile oak they are about 2cm long. Because of their presence in the landscape and their longevity, oaks were often used as markers and boundary trees. In Addlestone, Surrey, a tree known as the Crouch oak (3) is thought to be part of the old Windsor Forest and Great Park's Surrey boundary; it has now become an isolated street tree on the outskirts of the town. The oldest living tree in what remains of the Great Park today is a pedunculate oak named King Offa's oak (4), after the eighth-century Mercian king, and is said to date back to AD 710. It has the largest girth - more than 11 metres (36ft) - of the ancient oaks in the park. Not surprisingly, the centuries have taken their toll on this magnificent tree. Two individual sections are propped and partly collapsed, and a third section lies on the ground. However, King Offa's oak still has lots of healthy parts that produce new growth every year. Wyndham's oak (5) in Dorset is also called the Silton Oak and the Judge's Oak and is thought to be between 700 and 800 years old. Now standing in the meadow with few other trees, again, it is thought to have been a boundary tree on the edge of the forest of Gillingham, once a royal hunting forest. Old trees often have interesting associated stories to tell, but mystery surrounds an outstanding old sycamore (or is it sycamores?) that greets you as you enter the car park to the National Trust property at Saltram. This very special tree (6) is a central feature in the car park and there doesn't seem to be any written evidence as to why it has grown this way. I have visited it many times and my thoughts are that is part of a hedgerow long ago removed and perhaps layered. None of the old maps make this obvious, but its exposed roots imply that it may once have been part of a hedge bank. Another reason for these trunks, all lined up but obviously joined as one, is that it might just have been a fallen tree that was left and layered (propagated) itself, producing multiple stems, which were then purposely left as a feature. Without more evidence we will probably never know. Two intriguing woods can be visited in southern England. The first is Wistman's Wood, one of three isolated ancient upland woodlands on Dartmoor in Devon. When I first walked into this magical and beautiful woodland many years ago, I was stopped in my tracks by the sight of the dwarf oaks, their gnarled and entwined branches twisting in all directions, and below them an understory of granite boulders (7) covered with moss and lichen. The changing dappled light produces shadows and patterns across the boulders, known locally as clitter, adding to the wood's spectral qualities. The branches are clothed in a soft, verdant covering of epiphytic mosses and hanging lichens. It truly is an amazing and mystical place. One legend tells of the wood being home to large black 'wisht hounds' that had blood-red eyes and huge yellow fangs and roamed the moors on dark and misty nights looking for unwary travellers, led by the devil, or the Old Crockern, an ancient spirit living on the moor on Crockern Tor. The second is the forest at Kingley Vale in West Sussex made up predominately of yew, but with ash, hawthorn, holly and oak. Sadly, many of the ash trees have been infected with ash dieback (Hymenoscyphus fraxineus) and most are unlikely to survive. It is the yew trees that fascinate visitors most, with their twisting branches, snaking out from the parent trunk, reaching down to the ground (8) and creating arches and alleyways, which you have to scramble through to reach cave- and cathedral-like spaces. The branches that reach the ground, layer themselves, producing new roots and regrowing as siblings around their parent, increasing the forest's spread. These are known as walking trees and I love the thought of young trees being able to slowly walk farther and farther from their parent, exploring and extending their range by continually rooting the lower outstretched limbs. This is something you will only see in a natural yew forest where the trees can develop without human intervention, unlike the equally amazing huge ancient yews of the churchyards with all their lower limbs removed to about head height and above for easy access. Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire is home to Europe's longest lime tree avenue (Tilia x europaea), planted in 1840. It is almost 2 miles (4km) long and has 1,296 common limes planted along what is also the longest double avenue of lime trees in Europe. The avenue was closed for a time during the second world war when it was used as open-air storage for munitions in hundreds of corrugated iron stores. The road between the limes was reopened in 1955. Surprisingly, the black bands that can still be clearly seen on each of the trunks along the avenue (9) were from bands of grease painted on them in 1906 when the trees were found to be under attack from insects. The grease bands were to prevent the female winter moths climbing up them and laying their eggs in the canopies. Similarly, white bands painted on street lime trees to help them be seen during the blackouts of the second world war can often still be seen today. Farther north at Dunoon in Argyll, Scotland, entering the Benmore Botanic Gardens you are welcomed by the Avenue of Giants, dramatic lines of giant redwoods (Sequoiadendron giganteum) (10). Twenty pairs were planted in 1863 (one was replaced in 1995) by the American owner of the Benmore estate, James Piers Patrick. These giants are now nearly 170 years old. They stand at more than 50m, the tallest reaching almost 57m, and have girths ranging from more than 5m to almost 7m. They are among the oldest and tallest redwoods in Europe. As you walk along its 350-metre length, you feel very small. The life of a tree can be extended by coppicing and pollarding, traditional, ancient methods of woodland management that take advantage of the natural process by which trees grow. And it is through these practices of continually cutting back species for a variety of uses that some of our oldest trees survive, as coppiced stools and pollards, prolonging them long beyond their normal lifespan. Coppicing and pollarding mainly differ in the height of cut. Coppice is cut back to almost ground level, while pollards are cut back to the main trunk of a tree, but at varying heights, usually about head height. This was done to prevent livestock grazing the new regrowth. Many of the ancient and veteran pollarded and coppiced trees in forests today have not been managed for wood production for many decades and are known as lapsed pollards (11) and coppice (12). These trees, although visually stunning, are difficult to manage, with branch attachments that become stressed due to their weight held above often decaying, hollow trunks. They are, however, home to many invertebrates that can only survive on the decaying wood they produce, and nesting birds and sheltering bats that make use of the hollows. Coppicing has had a resurgence in popularity as it is a sustainable management method of woodland and woodland materials. Coppiced woodland is a haven for a rich diversity of wildlife, including rarer mammals such as the dormouse, and is carpeted with wildflowers in the spring. With enlightened understanding of the importance of sustainability, coppicing has a lot to offer, and I for one hope it is a practice that will continue to grow in its popularity.

Details of the scale of the apparent targeting came as Spain's highest criminal court opened an investigation into how the mobile phones of the prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, and the defence minister, Margarita Robles, came to be infected with Pegasus spyware last year. The Spanish government has refused to speculate on who may have been behind the 'illicit' and 'external' attacks, the existence of which it revealed on Monday at a hastily called press conference. The targeting of the prime minister is alleged to have taken place in May and June last year - a particularly turbulent time in Spanish politics. Not only was the Sanchez administration preparing its controversial and deeply divisive pardons of nine Catalan independence leaders jailed over their parts in the failed secession attempt in 2017, Spain was also engaged in a tense diplomatic row with Morocco. The mobile number selections believed to have been made by Morocco occurred in 2019, according to time stamps in the data, which includes more than 50,000 numbers of individuals selected as possible surveillance targets by NSO clients around the world. A Spanish mobile number belonging to Aminatou Haidar, a prominent human rights activist from Western Sahara, was included in the leaked database and found to have been targeted by Pegasus dating back to 2018, according to an analysis by Amnesty International. Traces of the Pegasus spyware, which is sold by the Israeli company NSO Group, were also found on a second phone belonging to Haidar as recently as November 2021. A Spanish mobile number for the journalist Ignacio Cembrero - whose work is focused on the Maghreb - was also listed on the Pegasus project database. The inclusion of more than 200 Spanish mobile numbers selected by a client believed to be Morocco does not indicate that every number was targeted or hacked. But it signals the client was apparently active in seeking out possible targets for surveillance within Spain. NSO said the fact a number appeared on the leaked list was in no way indicative of whether a number was targeted for surveillance using Pegasus. NSO has also said the database had 'no relevance' to the company. Morocco previously denied spying on any foreign leaders using Pegasus, and has said reporters investigating NSO were 'incapable of proving [the country had] any relationship' with NSO. But an analysis of the leaked records showed Morocco appeared to have listed dozens of French officials as candidates for possible surveillance, including President Emmanuel Macron. NSO has said its spyware is only sold to government clients for the purposes of investigating serious crime and terrorism. It has said it investigates legitimate allegations of abuse and strongly denied Pegasus was ever used to target Macron. The attacks came to light as the Spanish government continued to face questions over how Pegasus was allegedly used to monitor dozens of members of the Catalan independence movement, including the president of the north-eastern Spanish region, Pere Aragones, and three of his predecessors. The pro-independence Catalan regional government has pointed the finger at Spain's national intelligence centre (CNI), which insists its operations are overseen by the supreme court and that it acts 'in full accordance with the legal system, and with absolute respect for the applicable laws'. On Tuesday, a judge at Spain's Audiencia Nacional announced the beginning of an inquiry into 'a possible offence of the discovery and revelation of secrets' relating to the use of Pegasus to infect Sanchez's and Robles's devices. Recent media reports suggest the phone of a third politician - the then Spanish foreign minister, Arancha Gonzalez Laya - was also targeted with some kind of spyware in May last year. The row between Spain and Morocco occurred after the Madrid government allowed Brahim Ghali, a Western Sahara independence leader, to be treated for Covid-19 in Spain. Over the following days, as more than 8,000 people crossed from Morocco to Spain's north African enclave of Ceuta, Rabat's ambassador in Madrid appeared to draw a line between Ghali's treatment and the influx of migrants, warning that some actions had consequences that 'need to be assumed'. At a weekly press conference in Madrid on Tuesday, the Spanish government's spokesperson refused to comment on whether Morocco may have been behind the Pegasus attack, and on what effect such action could have on diplomatic relations. 'It's a bit hypothetical to talk about what the consequences could be - if we're able to find out where the attack came from,' said Isabel Rodriguez. 'But what we're clear about is that this attack was external and illicit. Those are the certainties we can use to make decisions on at the moment.' The government has ruled out any internal spying, adding the targeting must have come from abroad as any such monitoring in Spain would have required judicial authorisation. Rodriguez said the government had nothing to hide and promised full collaboration with any judicial investigation, 'including declassifying relevant documents should it prove necessary'. On Tuesday, Sanchez's Spanish Socialist Workers' party (PSOE) joined the three parties on the Spanish right in vetoing a parliamentary inquiry into the Pegasus scandal. A PSOE spokesperson said the mooted congressional committee was not needed as an internal investigation by Spain's national intelligence centre was already under way, as was an inquiry by the public ombudsman. The decision did not go down well with the PSOE's junior coalition partners in the far-left, anti-austerity Unidas Podemos alliance, nor with the pro-independence Catalan Republican Left party (ERC) on whose support the minority government relies in parliament. Gabriel Rufian, the ERC's spokesperson, described the use of Pegasus as 'a major scandal' and said it needed to be investigated. The Pegasus project is an investigative collaboration involving 16 media partners including the Guardian, the Wire, the Washington Post and Le Monde, and is coordinated by the French non-profit Forbidden Stories.

By the afternoon, thousands had arrived to make their voices heard - with many on opposite sides of America's abortion debate. The possibility of a repeal of the landmark 1973 decision brought energized and sometimes emotional supporters of Roe to protests in major cities from New York to San Francisco. But the supreme court was ground zero. Members of the US Capitol police closed the street in front of the supreme court building as protesters filled and took over the area, holding signs and large banners. It was a tense atmosphere that brought anti-abortion and pro-choice protesters into close range, outside the building where nine of the most powerful individuals in the US decide the nation's future. 'I'm here because I was here in 2016 and couldn't fucking believe that I had to tell people that women are people - but clearly we do,' said Cindy from Great Falls, Virginia, who asked that her last name be withheld. While she didn't expect to change the court's mind, she said, 'it's really nice to see a bunch of like minded people and get the vibe and I'm pissed - that's why I'm here - I'm pissed'. 'I hope that this will motivate people to vote because I think that's the only thing that's gonna help,' she added. As the number of protesters built steadily throughout the morning, Democratic senators gathered nearby on the Senate steps for a press conference. 'This is a five alarm fire,' said Senator Patty Murray, as demonstrators' chants rang out across the grassy lawn separating the capitol from the supreme court. While Democrats are already discussing legislation to codify abortion into the law, those on the anti-abortion side of the debate were relieved to hear Roe could be overturned, and often cited religious concerns. A young Black woman, who asked to be quoted anonymously for privacy reasons, said she came from the suburbs near the nation's Capitol and that she opposed abortion. 'I'm realizing that if people don't stand for people who can't stand up for themselves, then we're not really American. I'm here not representing any political party or any side or left or right or whatever. I'm here to just stand for Jesus and that we are made in the image of God,' she said, standing on the sidewalk outside the supreme court and holding a handmade sign. 'I did the Black Lives Matter protest because I believe in the sanctity of life and I have to keep that same energy. If you believe in life, it's sacred at all times. George Floyd mattered in his mother's womb and he mattered the day he was executed.' Alan Cohen, who said he lived in the local area, echoed similar religious concerns. 'What brings me out here is obedience to Jesus Christ. I'm a Christian, and God commands us to go and make disciples of all the nations, including the United States,' Cohen said. 'So in big events like this, especially ones that are very emotionally charged, our calling is to proclaim the Gospel, whether or not the crowd is popular with it or not. That's our obedience and call as Christians,' he added. While the supreme court's decision is not yet final, the leak of the draft is set to further enflame political division ahead of the midterm elections. 'Our country is experiencing a full partisan assault on women's rights and freedom to control our own bodies,' said Melanie Campbell, convener of the Black Women's Roundtable, which often polls a vital voting block for Democrats. 'As Black women, we stand at the intersection of voting rights and reproductive justice, with the full understanding that the struggle for our right to vote is inextricably tied to our reproductive rights as women.' The midterms will decide the fate of who controls the US Congress and will be held in November. If the supreme court overturns Roe, impact at the ballot box is widely predicted. Senator Bernie Sanders, standing inside the US Capitol, described it as a make or break moment for the Democratic party. 'What the Democrats have to do is rally the American people around something the American people feel strongly about. There is very strong majority support that a woman has the right to control their own bodies and that Roe v. Wade should not be repealed.'

Asked about a pensioner forced to travel around on buses to stay warm and keep heating bills down, the prime minister's first response was to boast that he introduced free travel for older people. During the interview on Tuesday, he admitted that the government had failed to do enough to alleviate the pain of soaring costs. Amid growing fears over the impact of the cost of living crisis, the Treasury is looking at whether it can cover some or all of this autumn's energy price rise from government funds, the Guardian has learned. It is understood that Rishi Sunak's department has been examining whether to simply absorb most of the cost, rather than offer a discount on bills or a council tax rebate. Sunak is concerned about the inflationary impact of more borrowing - but the option of absorbing some or all of the rise has been considered. A Treasury source said they 'don't recognise this as policy work being done at this point in time'. A spokesperson added: 'Energy bills are capped until the autumn. We won't know yet what the size of the rise will be given the volatility of prices we are seeing now and it's right that we wait ... [to] decide what the solution should be.' Thursday's vote will be the first UK-wide electoral test since details emerged of lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street. Tory MPs are braced for losses in London and the south of England as a toxic combination of Partygate and the rocketing cost of living take their toll. MPs in northern England said they are more confident of holding on to local councillors. In a pre-election interview on ITV's Good Morning Britain, the prime minister struggled to articulate what help may be available to a pensioner struggling to make ends meet. Asked about Elsie, a 77-year-old who has cut back on meals and uses buses to stay warm, he responded: 'The 24-hour freedom bus pass was actually something that I introduced.' Asked what more Elsie could cut back on, he said he 'didn't want her to have to cut back on anything'.  Speaking to LBC's Tonight with Andrew Marr on Tuesday night, Reid said Elise was 'disappointed' with Johnson's response to her plight. With concerns about the cost of living a major election issue, some Tory MPs responded with irritation to Johnson's performance. 'The thing with him is, he hasn't read the script sometimes,' said one. 'There are so many positive things he could have said.' Another backbencher and former cabinet minister said: 'It won't have won us many votes. Boris doesn't actually care about these people. He basically despises most of the human race, so that makes it quite difficult for him to sympathise.' The shadow work and pensions secretary, Jon Ashworth, said that 'boasting about the London bus pass reveals just how out of touch this narcissistic prime minister is'. He added that the state pension had just suffered the biggest real-terms cut in 50 years. Both main parties are desperately trying to manage expectations before Thursday's elections, with the Tories warning of as many as 800 losses out of more than 5,000 council seats being contested, and Labour suggesting they could make few gains. The Conservative peer and elections expert, Robert Hayward, said he projected net Tory losses of 250 to 350 seats, adding: 'That will mean one or two headline Labour gains but whether that is good enough for them to be comfortable is a question mark.' Tory insiders say there are serious jitters about losing the London council of Wandsworth, though Labour said that is unlikely. A senior Tory figure said the area had become more affluent over time, which might usually favour the Tories, but instead it had seen 'gentrification with remainers'. A London MP warned that among middle class, 'middle-of-the-road' voters in the south of England, 'it's a Boris problem'. One senior Lib Dem strategist said the party was looking at possible gains in the new Somerset unitary authority, Oxford, Wimbledon and Woking in the south, as well as Westmoreland and Hull in the north. 'We don't expect significant takeovers of loads of different councils but we hope to see steady progress in the blue seats that are up,' they said.  By contrast, 'red wall' Conservatives are quietly confident of holding on to their council seats. -  In key local council fights - such as Bury, Bolton, Wigan and Hartlepool - which will be seen to foreshadow whether Labour will be able to retake or hold seats at the next elections, Tories described voters as angry with Johnson over Partygate, but unwilling to make the switch to Labour. One Midlands Tory in a newly won constituency seat said: 'Logically, we should actually be in a position to make gains, but Partygate and the cost of living are meaning our voters are not reliably turning out. But I'm not detecting people going back to Labour at all.' A Tory MP in north-west England said they feared that anger towards Johnson was unlikely to dissipate by the next general election, though voters were prepared to keep voting Tory locally because Labour were still seen as the establishment force. 'I think the anger is now a permanent feature. We can, in a sense, get away with it this time because he's not on the ballot paper. But this is definitely going to be held against us at a general election.'", "833d188357d79b6c73d9d2c7686f122e3c7b7e92d57ad5d15cab6d0f": "Plans to include an overflight of Hebron in the occupied West Bank in Israel's annual independence day airshow have been met with angry responses from Palestinians and leftwing Israelis. The Israel air force said on its website at the weekend that the controversial overflight sought by settler leaders would take place on Thursday. The decision puts an end to uncertainty over the display after an initial announcement was taken down amid criticism from Mossi Raz, a legislator in the leftwing Meretz party, which is part of the ruling coalition, who termed it 'a provocative show of force and superiority'. The decision comes as about 1,000 Hebron settlers, viewed as including some of the most militant Israelis in the West Bank, make plans to expand their heavily guarded enclaves in Hebron, a city of roughly 200,000 Palestinians. 'This is a kind of annexation of Hebron to the Israeli state,' said the Palestinian activist Issa Amro, the head of the Friends of Hebron organisation that opposes Israeli settlement in the flashpoint city. 'This is a provocation of our feelings.' Palestinians will be doing anything but celebrating Israeli independence. They view that as the Nakba (catastrophe) when about 700,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled in the war surrounding Israel's creation. 'Instead of apologising for the Nakba, they continue to show us more signs they want the Palestinians to leave their homes,' Amro said. Ori Givati, spokesperson for Breaking the Silence, a group of anti-occupation Israeli military veterans, also criticised the planned overflight, saying it would 'represent another step in the de facto annexation' of the occupied Palestinian territories. 'It is hard to ignore the irony of an Israeli independence flyover over the heads of a people to whom Israel has denied independence for 55 years,' Givati said. But as has often been the case with the hard-right prime minister Naftali Bennett's coalition, the views of the left were disregarded in favour of those of the settlers and their allies. The planes are slated to fly over the Cave of the Patriarchs, a site where Jewish tradition holds that biblical patriarchs and matriarchs are buried. The same site is holy to Muslims as the Ibrahimi mosque. Yigal Dilmoni, the CEO of the Yesha Council, the umbrella group for settlers in the West Bank, hailed the decision. 'There is symbolism that the flight of the air force on independence day, which symbolises the return of the nation of Israel to the land of Israel, passes over Hebron and the Cave of the Patriarchs. This is a symbolic matter of values and ideals.' Eliyahu Liebman, the mayor for Jewish settlers in Hebron and neighbouring Kiryat Arba, said a wrong was being righted. 'This says that we are gaining equality and being treated like any other citizen of the state of Israel in all matters including the flyover which will go over our houses and not just certain cities,' he said Liebman added that every year, local residents and officials had impressed upon authorities that being included in the overflight was 'very, very, very important' to them and that this year they finally got a positive response. The overflight route will also include the south Hebron hills, where settlers are known for their violence towards Palestinians and Israeli solidarity activists.About 1,000 Palestinian herders there face the possibility of intensified military restrictions and even possible eviction due to army plans to expand the use of a firing zone, according to their lawyer, Shlomo Lecker, who represents them at the supreme court. The Hebron settlers count anti-Arab extremists in their ranks, including the far-right opposition MP Itamar Ben-Gvir, who has advocated for the expulsion of Arab citizens of Israel deemed to be disloyal to the state. But in recent years there has been a process of mainstreaming the Hebron settlers. President Isaac Herzog visited the Cave of the Patriarchs in November, declaring that recognition of Jewish ties to the site 'must be beyond all controversy'.", "f781bf68765447c77663e33842dbe0ecd29a26d5175c932aa88cc7a9": "The World Trade Organization's (WTO) most powerful members said on Tuesday that they had agreed on a proposed waiver on intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines in the hopes of speeding up rollouts worldwide. The proposal from the so-called Quad (the European Union, India, South Africa and the United States) will still have to go to the full council, but China has indicated it is prepared to vote in favour. If passed, it could allow developing world countries to manufacture Covid vaccines without paying Pfizer, Moderna and other pharmaceutical companies licenses. WTO director-general Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala has made vaccine equity her top priority since taking office in 2021. She has been working for months to broker a compromise after an 18-month-long impasse. 'What the discussions were aiming at was coming up with something workable,' Okonjo-Iweala told Reuters, saying she hoped the WTO's 164 members would finalise and approve the proposal by June. 'This will advance the discussion and dialogue. For the next pandemic or a flare-up of this one, this is hugely important,' she said. Vaccination rates in wealthy countries are now between 70% and 90%, and many are discussing a fourth round of injections. But in poorer countries vaccination rates remain low, due to cost and lack of supply. More than 30 countries have vaccinated less than 10% of their population, according to the Multilateral Leaders Taskforce on Covid-19. The pharmaceutical industry has lobbied against the move and other critics have charged that waiving patents will still not solve vaccine inequity in the short-term because manufacturing and supply issues will remain. The document showed that there were still unresolved areas in the draft deal, including on the duration of the waiver's application which could be either three or five years. Okonjo-Iweala said recent negotiations had focused on getting broader support for the deal, including from China. She said Beijing had indicated it was 'favourably disposed' to being considered as a developed country in this deal and thus subject to stricter rules.

'I certainly made mistakes, and I take responsibility,' the Microsoft co-founder told Today on Tuesday morning, when asked if he was ever unfaithful throughout his 27-year marriage to French Gates. 'The divorce is definitely a sad thing,' the 66-year-old billionaire and philanthropist said. 'I have responsibility for causing a lot of pain to my family. It was a tough year. I feel good that all of us are moving forward now.' Gates added: 'Melinda and I are continuing to work together. It was sad and tragic, but now we're moving together.' Gates refused to disclose additional details about the affair, saying: 'I don't think delving into the particulars at this point is constructive, but yes, I caused pain and I feel terrible about that.' In an interview with CBS in March, French Gates explained that numerous factors led to the couple's high-profile divorce last May. 'There just came a point in time where there was enough there that I realized it just wasn't healthy,' she said. 'I couldn't trust what we had.' French Gates also revealed that she cried numerous times during her marriage, sometimes while lying on the floor. 'How can I get up? How am I going to move?' she would ask herself, she said. In response to French Gates's comments, Bill Gates said, 'This was a very tough thing. ... We had a lot of amazing things in our marriage. The kids, the foundation, the enjoyment we had. And so it's a very hard adjustment.' He continued: 'I know divorces are different, but it's just a complete change. We were partners, we kind of grew up together, and now that's different. We're not married.' French Gates described her current relationship with Bill Gates as 'friendly' but explained she is not friends with her former husband. 'Friends is a different word for me,' French Gates said. 'That might come over time. But for me there's still healing that needs to happen.' Gates has released a new book called How to Prevent the Next Pandemic in which he outlines steps the world should take to avoid another global outbreak.", "93f6c904644b3c9e67873707addaa6884bdf7772939484bf378b99c2": "A death row inmate in Arizona has two weeks to decide whether to be executed with cyanide gas, the poison known as Zyklon B used by the Nazis to murder millions of people in Auschwitz and other extermination camps. On Tuesday the supreme court of Arizona issued an execution warrant for Frank Atwood that, barring last-minute appeals, will see him put to death on 8 June. The prisoner now has until 19 May to choose his preferred method of death - either lethal injection or hydrogen cyanide, a poisonous gas made notorious by the Nazis as a mass killing technique during the Holocaust. Atwood's lawyers are scrambling to try to persuade the condemned man not to opt for cyanide. They point out that the last time Arizona used the gas to kill two prisoners in the 1990s it led to gruesome and prolonged deaths lasting in one case 18 minutes, during which time the prisoner was observed to suffer 'agonizing choking and gagging'. 'Cyanide is as bad as everybody thinks it is - there's a reason the Nazis used it: it's a horrific way to die,' said Joseph Perkovich of Phillips Black, a member of Atwood's legal team. 'We are now in the position of having to dissuade our client from opting to go into a cyanide gas chamber, and we have 15 days to do it.' Arizona is the only state in the union that has a working gas chamber, though seven states have lethal gas in some form on their execution protocols. Last year, the Guardian revealed that the Arizona department of corrections had dusted off its gas chamber in Florence which had been unused for two decades, and had spent more than $2,000 procuring the ingredients of cyanide gas. The news provoked outrage among Auschwitz survivors in Germany and Israel. Now Atwood is faced with the choice of dying under this method. Should he take the cyanide option, he would become the first person this century to be executed using the 'Holocaust gas'. Atwood's late mother, Alice, came from a Jewish family in Vienna. She fled Austria in 1939, escaping Gestapo persecution and possible murder in the Nazi gas chambers. Perkovich described the decision bearing down on his client as a Hobson's choice. The alternative death protocol allowed by Arizona - lethal injection - also holds out the prospect of an agonizing and torturous death. Confusion reigns over the lethal drugs that the state intends to use in executions. Arizona has acquired batches of the sedative pentobarbital through secretive channels using a compounding pharmacy, and lawyers question whether the drugs are fit for use in an execution. In addition, Atwood has degeneration of his spine that would cause him excruciating pain were he to be strapped to the gurney during the lethal injection process. 'Every second on that table will be agonizing due to the severe spinal stenosis afflicting no less than 16 openings where his nerves exit his spine,' Perkovich said. The last time that Arizona carried out an execution, in July 2014, it took almost two hours to kill Joseph Wood using a cocktail of lethal drugs. The prisoner was injected 15 times but continued to gasp and gulp a total of 660 times. Atwood, 66, was sentenced to death for killing an eight-year-old girl, Vicki Lynne Hoskinson, in 1984. He has consistently claimed that he is innocent of the murder. Perkovich said the condemned man was resigned to his imminent execution, buoyed up by his strong faith as a devout Greek Orthodox Christian. 'He is more prepared to meet his end than anybody I know,' the lawyer said. But he added that the prospect of dying in torturous agony from cyanide was a complicating factor. Atwood wishes to receive his last rites, and as such needs to be lucid at that moment rather than disassociating from pain. Before Atwood's scheduled execution, a second Arizona death row inmate is set to be put to death. Clarence Dixon has an execution warrant for 11 May for the 1977 murder of a student, Deana Bowdoin. He will be administered lethal injection as the default execution method after he declined to specify his preferred technique. Atwood's lawyers are so concerned by what they consider to be the unacceptable choice between cyanide gas and potentially faulty lethal drugs that they have proposed that the state's law is amended to allow him to be killed by firing squad. That would have the benefit of being simple and transparent, they say. Perkovich, a prominent lawyer who has dedicated years to representing death row inmates, said that he and his co-counsel now found themselves in the bizarre situation of having to give legal advice on how to kill a man. 'Our responsibilities to the client include advising him which violent, extremely painful way to die he should choose. What does that do to us? I'm speechless. There really aren't words.'", "becbe41cbae2111846448e5f440f4b3e3e5cc5450c4f31f2956c2eae": "Fiji's high court has ruled that the US government can seize a superyacht believed to be owned by a Russian oligarch who faces sanctions from the US and the EU, which is docked in the Fijian port of Lautoka. Judge Deepthi Amaratunga granted the request from Fijian authorities to register and enforce US warrants to seize the Amadea, which has been docked in Lautoka since 13 April and which is believed to belong to Suleiman Kerimov, who is considered a close ally of Vladimir Putin. The vessel with a crew of at least 25 was fined by Fijian authorities for breaching immigration regulations when it entered Fiji in early April after an 18-day voyage from Mexico. The defence claimed the yacht is owned by Eduard Khudainatov, who is not facing sanctions. The defence lawyer Faizal Hanif, acting for the Amadea's registered owners Millemaria Investment Ltd, asked the court for a stay on the ruling, expressing fears that US authorities would sail the vessel out of Fiji. The judge indicated he would grant a stay order and insist the vessel remain in Fiji during the 30-day appeal period.

Billions of people in countries including China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan struggle to access journalism produced without intervention from politicians, with reporters in these places often facing threats to their wellbeing. The annual press freedom list, produced by the campaign group Reporters Without Borders, surveys the state of the media in 180 countries and territories. It blames 'globalised and unregulated online information space that encourages fake news and propaganda' for the worsening situation in many countries. One of the biggest fallers on the list is Myanmar, where dozens of journalists have been put in jail since last year's military coup. Reporters Without Borders said press freedom in the country had been set back by 10 years. The organisation's campaign chief, Rebecca Vincent, said that although the UK ranked a relatively healthy 24th on the list, concerns remained. Key issues include ongoing threats to journalists in Northern Ireland after the killing of Lyra McKee, the government's attempts to install a political ally as chair of the media watchdog Ofcom, and the ongoing extradition process involving the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. She said: 'The Assange case is globally important and the UK government is enabling the US government to pursue this case against him. It is also becoming increasingly difficult for journalists of all stripes to access information from this government.' Vincent said weak press freedom left citizens uninformed and less able to hold their governments to account. She warned that authoritarian attitudes towards the media could often spill over into other neighbouring countries, adding: 'The war in Ukraine is an extreme example of that - it was a premeditated information war that has turned into a conflict that threatens global security.' Europe is split in two on the rankings, with Nordic countries such Norway, Denmark and Sweden once again topping the list and receiving praise for following a 'democratic model where freedom of expression flourishes'. The situation in eastern Europe is much worse, with Poland, Hungary and Albania all scoring relatively badly. The lowest-ranked European country for press freedom is Greece, which slips to 108th in the ranking after the crime journalist Giorgos Karaivaz was gunned down on a street in Athens. The annual ranking has been put together for the last 20 years and is created by assessing direct threats against journalists around the world and combining it with the results of a survey of hundreds of journalists, academics and human rights activists. Among the worst performers is Hong Kong, which has plummeted to 148th after the introduction of a national security law that targets journalists critical of the Chinese government. Russia received one of the lowest rankings after the Kremlin established 'complete control of news and information by establishing extensive wartime censorship, blocking the media and pursuing non-compliant journalists, forcing many of them into exile'. 1.

It is illegal for women to terminate their pregnancies in any circumstance in 24 countries, with a further 37 restricting access in any case except when the mother's life is in danger. As a leaked document signals that the US supreme court is poised to strike down the landmark 1973 ruling in Roe v Wade, millions of American women face losing their access to legal abortions, joining millions more living in those countries rejecting a woman's right to choose. According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), unsafe abortions kill more than 47,000 people every year, with five million hospitalised for complications such as bleeding or infection. WHO data also shows that banning abortions has little or no effect on abortion rates throughout the world. Latin America has some of the world's most extreme anti-abortion laws. Abortion is illegal under any circumstances in El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras. Since 1998, at least 140 women in El Salvador, where abortion is punishable with up to 35 years imprisonment, have been charged under anti-abortion laws. Many of them had suffered a miscarriage. In Brazil, under the far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, access to abortion - only legal in the country on the grounds of rape, severe foetal defects and women's health - has been curtailed. In 2020, the country introduced new legislation that requires medical staff to inform the police of rape survivors seeking the procedure. However, other countries on the continent have broadened access to legal abortions. In February, Colombia decriminalised abortion, while Chile signalled that wider access to abortions may be enshrined in its new constitution. In 2020, Argentina legalised abortion on request in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy. Uruguay passed similar legislation, allowing abortions up to the 12th week of pregnancy, in 2012. Africa has the highest death rate related to unsafe abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, with 92% of women of reproductive age in the region having restricted access to legal terminations. The Center for Reproductive Rights estimates that the deaths of up to 15,000 women a year could be prevented by improving access to safe abortions across the continent. In several countries, including Egypt, Democratic Republic of Congo and Senegal, abortion is completely illegal. According to the Association of Senegalese Women Lawyers, 19% of female prisoners in Senegal in 2015 were incarcerated on the grounds of abortion or infanticide. However, the number of African countries that allow abortion on request is growing. In 2021, Benin became the seventh country in the continent to legalise the procedure in the first trimester. Nearly all European countries offer legal abortions, yet it remains completely illegal in three microstates: Andorra, Malta and Vatican City. However, convictions in these countries remain rare. Poland is the only country where access to abortion is highly restricted. After a legislative ban was introduced in 2021, abortion can only be carried out when the pregnancy was caused by an illegal act, such as rape or incest, or when it threatens a woman's health. In reality, though, it is difficult to secure a legal abortion on the grounds of rape, with fewer than five legal abortions a year carried out for this reason. Even when a woman's health is at risk, doctors have become reluctant to carry out an abortion, leading to several deaths. In December, Poland also announced it is planning to introduce a centralised register of pregnancies that would oblige doctors to report all pregnancies and miscarriages to the government. In Romania, women are finding it increasingly difficult to access their legal right to abortion, with doctors refusing to provide the service. A 2019 survey found that only 25% of hospitals offered to carry out the procedure on request. According to the WHO, more than half of all unsafe abortions occur in Asia, most of them in south and central Asia. Abortion remains completely illegal in Laos and the Philippines. The Philippines' ban is still based on colonial-era laws introduced by the Spanish in 1870. An additional law passed in 1987 obliges the government to place equal weight on protecting the 'life of the unborn from conception' as on the life of the mother. Reproductive services are also severely curtailed, with emergency contraception, also known as the morning-after pill, banned across the country. A woman who has an abortion in the Philippines risks up to six years in prison. While there is no collected data on how many are convicted on abortion-related offences, reports of such cases in local media are not rare.", "0928288dab405bc4a257c1cb71e252f7975b854907d7a78c5e48aef5": "", "2000745918b4a30097029d63a8b7d759d8cb975444a4194162dd3f23": "In the 1997 general election Roy Jenkins compared Tony Blair to a man carrying a Ming vase across a slippery floor, tiptoeing gingerly towards a Labour victory. The same description fits Sinn Fein as it approaches Northern Ireland's assembly election on Thursday, cautiously edging towards a potentially momentous win. The prize is to emerge as the region's largest party and claim the post of first minister - a symbolic and psychological breakthrough for Irish nationalism given Northern Ireland was designed to have a permanent unionist majority. Sinn Fein's response to this giddy prospect has been to run an ultra-guarded, disciplined campaign that minimises gaffes, surprises or spontaneity - anything that might risk a slip. 'I've never seen Sinn Fein be so cautious here, they're really determined to not frighten the horses,' said Jon Tonge, a University of Liverpool politics professor and authority on Northern Ireland. 'Their last big controversy was two years ago. They used to have one every two months. They're taking it to new levels to not upset anyone.' The party that once acted as a mouthpiece for the IRA has played down its push for a united Ireland and focused on the cost of living, a healthcare crisis and other bread-and-butter issues. During Easter, republican commemorations leaders paid tribute to the movement's sacrifices and martyrs without naming the IRA. The tactic is one reason the overall election campaign has so far been a sedate affair, with few sparks or memorable moments. Pundits have branded it 'dull' and 'boring'. The low-key atmosphere has undermined attempts by some unionists to depict this as an existential battle over Northern Ireland's place in the UK. In a televised debate on Sunday night, Michelle O'Neill, the party's leader in Northern Ireland, stuck to familiar lines seemingly designed to soothe any concerns around her becoming first minister. 'There was nothing awful about Michelle O'Neill's performance, but there was nothing memorable about it either,' said the Belfast Telegraph. For Sinn Fein that would be a good result given O'Neill was put under pressure over a disclosure her party had sought political engagement with Saoradh, a republican party allegedly linked to the New IRA. 'No gang who is involved in criminality, armed action, should exist today,' she said. O'Neill's debate performance was another example of Sinn Fein's softly-softly approach, said Deirdre Heenan, a social policy professor at the University of Ulster. 'They feel the first minister post is within their grasp. For them what's important is not to make a gaffe, not to get embroiled in controversy.' That was why the party had given John Finucane, a high-profile lawyer and its MP for Belfast North, a prominent role in the campaign, said Heenan. 'I think that's a clever strategy. He's a middle-class, articulate professional with a cross-community background. He has been put out to attract non-aligned voters.' Mary Lou McDonald, the party's Dublin-based leader and another able media performer, has also been prominent. Opinion polls suggest Sinn Fein will be the biggest party but fall far short of a majority in the 90-seat Stormont assembly, which will be elected by proportional representation in 18 five-member constituencies. The most recent poll put Sinn Fein on 26%, the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) on 20%, the centrist Alliance on 14% and smaller nationalist and unionist parties accounting for most of the rest. Sinn Fein hopes the prospect of O'Neill becoming first minister will animate its base and that disdain for the DUP will encourage Alliance and Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) voters to give transfers to Sinn Fein candidates. By avoiding traditional Irish republican tropes the party also hopes to encourage some unionists to abstain or at least not transfer votes to the DUP, which has been convulsed over Brexit and the Northern Ireland protocol. If overall support levels are replicated in seats, power-sharing rules would make O'Neill eligible to be first minister and the DUP leader, Jeffrey Donaldson, deputy first minister, posts of equal power at the head of an executive drawn from all major parties. Sinn Fein has been in the executive since the 1998 Good Friday agreement and held the deputy first minister post since 2007. In practical terms, nudging ahead of the DUP and nabbing the first minister post would not change the balance of power. Nor would it signal a surge in support for a united Ireland. Most voters favour remaining in the UK. But the symbolism would matter, said Tonge. 'It would be huge. The stakes are genuinely high.' Sinn Fein would not push for an immediate border poll - not least because it would almost certainly lose - but use its victory to foster momentum for a referendum further bolstered by the party's growing clout in the south, said Tonge. Donaldson has refused to say whether he would serve in an executive with O'Neill as first minister, fuelling expectations of weeks or months of post-election wrangling before a new executive is formed. In addition to the Northern Ireland protocol, which unionist parties want removed or diluted, there will be arguments over rules on mandatory power-sharing. The requirement helped clinch the Good Friday agreement but is blamed for locking parties into dysfunctional executives that squabble, collapse and neglect services, notably healthcare. Critics contend Stormont is no Ming vase, more a cracked pot.", "a42750101826f018d934d47ddfc3b9537e73bbb38ae95582067ba0e2": "US airlines are still experiencing staffing shortages as air travel rebounded after initial Covid-19 shutdowns in 2020 when many airline workers were encouraged to go on furlough, resign, or retire early. The phenomenon promises to disrupt travel for flyers even as Americans largely seek to return to many pre-pandemic habits, including air travel for work and tourism. At JetBlue, flight delays and cancellations have been attributed to staff shortages. Transport Workers United, which represents about 5,000 flight attendants at JetBlue, criticized the airline's blaming of flight attendants for not accepting enough assignments, causing delays and cancellations.  The union argued JetBlue had responded to staff shortages and operational problems by increasing disciplinary actions toward workers, including increasing the amount of critical coverage days workers must be available to work or else accrue disciplinary attendance points that could lead to termination. 'Historically, JetBlue has always run a skeleton staff of crew members in all their departments,' said a longtime flight attendant at JetBlue who requested to remain anonymous as they are not authorized to speak with the media. The flight attendant said problems related to Covid-19 such as canceled, rescheduled or delayed flights that prolong time on duty or away from home and difficulties with transportation and hotel lodging for flight attendants have made many workers reluctant to accept extra assignments. They also said many flight attendants experiencing delays or flight changes have waited several hours for JetBlue to get them a hotel room or transportation to a hotel in a layover city, cutting into their rest time. Some have given up and paid for a hotel or transportation out of pocket. 'You are kept hostage at times and are unable to get home. This is really hard for people that do have children or parents that they help take care of,' the flight attendant said. 'They're not thinking of us as humans. We're still human beings involved in all of this too. We want to see our company succeed and we all want to come to work, we want to do the best we can, we want the passengers to keep coming back, but I feel like the thought of us as actual human beings has been removed from the equation. We're just robots that are here to get the job done and I think that's the thing we're struggling with the most, that there is no respect for the workers any more.' Gary Peterson, vice-president of the air division at Transport Workers United, argued JetBlue and other carriers have been competing in a race to the bottom terms of how workers are treated, retaining enough workers, and maintaining airline jobs as career jobs. 'I think there's a systemic problem in the industry - everybody's trying to compete against the lowest carrier, instead of setting themselves up to be the premier carrier,' said Peterson. 'Sleeping in the hallway at the airport - that never used to happen in the industry, and now it's becoming the new norm.' At Spirit Airlines, staffing problems have contributed to four operation meltdowns since August 2021, an unheard-of frequency according to the Association of Flight Attendants - Communications Workers of America (AFA-CWA). Workers at Spirit Airlines have protested outside airports in Las Vegas, Orlando and Dallas in recent weeks over contract violations by the airlines, mass cancellations that have stranded flight attendants, and persistent staffing shortages. Don Reno Intreglia, a Spirit Airlines flight attendant based in Orlando, Florida, and AFA-CWA vice-president for Spirit Airlines, said the airline's cancellation team and a separate team that handles flight attendant scheduling will get out of sync or fall behind, causing a domino effect in operations and leaving flight attendants to deal with frustrated passengers with no information. The result, he said, had been flight attendants being stranded away from home with no hotel lodging, left for up to 30 hours with no answers or resolution. 'It's been horrible on the morale for the flight attendants, because you're sleeping on an airport floor, you've got pretty much nowhere to go. We had flight attendants who were getting kicked out of airports in the middle of the night,' said Intreglia. 'We want the traveling public to know that we're trying to pressure management into making serious changes, so that we are prepared for the summer travel.' Pilots have been experiencing similar difficulties. Pilots with Alaska Airlines are voting on a strike authorization as new union contract negotiations continue and the airline experiences a shortage of pilots. At Delta Air Lines, pilots represented by the Airline Pilots Association have been protesting over the past several weeks outside Delta hubs in Seattle, Atlanta, Salt Lake City, Detroit, Los Angeles and Minneapolis, over excessive scheduling and fatigue. 'Our pilots are tired and fatigued,' said Captain Evan Baach. 'Our pilots are working record amounts of overtime, we're working longer days, we have shorter nights in between our duty periods. We want the company to match their words with action and make changes to the pilot schedules.' A spokesperson for Delta Air Lines said in an email, 'Pilot schedules remain in line with all requirements set by the FAA as well as those outlined in our pilot contract. All of our people, including our pilots, are working hard to restore our airline and deliver for our customers as we emerge from the pandemic. We are grateful for and proud of their efforts.'

Michael Carpenter, the US ambassador to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe told reporters in Washington on Monday: 'This is straight out of the Kremlin's playbook,' he added. Carpenter said that the United States also believed Russia was considering a similar plan in a third region, Kherson, where Moscow has recently solidified its control and imposed use of its ruble currency. Carpenter said it was also possible that Russia's leaders would try to take over other parts of Ukraine, by imposing 'puppets and proxies' in local governments and forcing out democratically elected officials. He said that this had appeared to be Moscow's initial aim in Kyiv -- a plan that included installing a new constitution in Ukraine -- but that Russian forces had been forced to drop back to the country's east and south after they were unable to take the capital.  Thank you for following today's live coverage of the war in Ukraine.  This blog is closed - however our coverage continues here. Russia is replenishing significant losses of equipment and continuing to focus on establishing complete control over the settlements of Rubizhne and Popasna in the Donetsk region, Ukraine's military claims.  Ukrainian defenders successfully thwarted 24 Russian attacks, as well as destroying six tanks, five artillery systems and 22 units of combat armoured equipment, according to the latest operational report from Ukraine's general staff of the armed forces. Here are some of the latest images to come out of Ukraine today.  The US has provided Ukraine with much-needed military support including Javelins, Stingers, howitzers and other material being hustled to Eastern Europe to resupply Ukraine's military in its fight against Russia. However, a growing concern has emerged as the war drags on: can the US sustain the cadence of shipping vast amounts of arms to Ukraine while maintaining its own stockpile? The US already has provided about 7,000 Javelins, including some that were delivered during the Trump administration, about one-third of its stockpile, to Ukraine, according to an analysis by Mark Cancian, a senior adviser with the Centre for Strategic and International Studies international security program.  Analysts also estimate that the US has sent about one-quarter of its stockpile of shoulder-fired Stinger missiles to Ukraine. Raytheon Technologies CEO Greg Hayes told investors last week during a quarterly call that his company, which makes the weapons system, wouldn't be able to ramp up production until next year due to parts shortages.  'Could this be a problem? The short answer is, Probably, yes,'' Cancian, a retired Marine colonel and former government specialist on Pentagon budget strategy, war funding and procurement, told the Associated Press. Cancian, the former government specialist on defence budget strategy, said the fact that Stingers and Javelins were not included in the most recent tranche of weapons the Biden administration announced it was sending to Ukraine could be a sign that Pentagon officials are mindful about inventory as they conduct contingency planning for other possible conflicts. 'There's no question that whatever war plan they're looking at there is risk associated with the depleting levels of Stingers and Javelins, and I'm sure that they're having that discussion at the Pentagon,' he said. Pentagon officials recently sat down with some of the leading defence contractors, including Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Boeing, General Dynamics, BAE Systems and Northrop Grumman to discuss efforts to ramp up production. The European Commission may spare Hungary and Slovakia from a soon-to-be-prepared embargo on buying Russian oil, accounting for the two countries' dependence on Russian crude, two EU officials said on Monday. The Commission is expected to finalise on Tuesday work on the next, and sixth package of EU sanctions against Russia over its actions in Ukraine, which would include a ban on buying Russian oil.  Hungary - which received 58% of its crude oil and oil products imports from Russia last year, according to the International Energy Agency (IAE) - is heavily dependent on Russian oil and has repeatedly said it would not sign up to sanctions involving energy.  Slovakia received 96% of its supply from Russia, according to IEA data. To keep the 27-nation bloc united, the Commission may offer Slovakia and Hungary 'an exemption or a long transition period', one official said, as reported by Reuters. The oil embargo is likely to be phased in, most likely taking full effect from the start of next year, officials said. Overall, the EU is dependent on Russia for 26% of its oil imports. The European Union hopes to pass the sixth round of sanctions against Russia at the next meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs Council, the bloc's chief diplomat said on Monday. Josep Borrell told a news conference in Panama City, where he is on an official visit, the bloc hopes to curb Russia's energy exports as part of its efforts to sanction Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reports. The European Commission, the executive branch of the union, is expected to propose the package of EU sanctions this week, including a potential embargo on buying Russian oil - a measure that would deprive Moscow of a large revenue stream. However, many EU countries remain divided. Borrell, who chairs the foreign affairs council meetings, said he hopes the EU will be able to take 'measures to significantly limit these imports' but conceded so far there is no agreement from all the members. 'But I am confident that, at least with regard to oil imports, this agreement will be possible between now and the next Council meeting,' he added. The Council has meetings scheduled for 10 May and 16 May later this month. Here is a little more detail surrounding US claims that Russia plans to 'annex' Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Michael Carpenter, the US ambassador to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe told reporters in Washington on Monday: 'This is straight out of the Kremlin's playbook,' he added. Carpenter said that the United States also believed Russia was considering a similar plan in a third region, Kherson, where Moscow has recently solidified its control and imposed use of its ruble currency. Carpenter said it was also possible that Russia's leaders would try to take over other parts of Ukraine, by imposing 'puppets and proxies' in local governments and forcing out democratically elected officials. He said that this had appeared to be Moscow's initial aim in Kyiv -- a plan that included installing a new constitution in Ukraine -- but that Russian forces had been forced to drop back to the country's east and south after they were unable to take the capital.  Russia's top general, Valery Gerasimov, visited the Donbas front in the Ukraine war last week, a Pentagon official said. Reports that he was injured in a Ukrainian attack could not be confirmed. 'What we can confirm is that we know that for several days last week he was in the Donbas,' a senior US defense official told journalists on Monday. 'We don't believe that he's still there - that he has left and he's back in Russia,' the official said. 'We cannot confirm reports that he was injured.' According to reports citing Ukraine officials, on Saturday Ukraine forces shelled a command centre in Izium, where Gerasimov, chief of general staff of the Russian armed forces, visited to meet with top field commanders. But he had apparently left the site before the shelling took place, according to Agence France-Presse. Gerasimov was believed to be touring the front to better understand field conditions and rally his troops as Russian forces, after failing to capture Kyiv in the north, attempt to take control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of the east. If you have just joined us, here is a quick re-cap of where things stand: The evacuation of civilians trapped in Mariupol is set to resume on Tuesday, 3 May, the city council announced. In an update over its official Facebook page, officials said an evacuation of civilians has been agreed to start at 7am local time. 'It's official. Evacuation. With the support of the UN and the Red Cross for tomorrow the evacuation of civilians has been agreed,' the council said.  Russian forces in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine -- where the bulk of the fighting is taking place -- are suffering from poor command and control, low morale, and less than ideal logistics, a senior US Defense Department official, has said in a statement on Monday. The Russians have had some minor gains east of the Ukrainian cities of Izyum and Popasna, the official said, adding that that progress has been anaemic.  'What we saw there in Popasna is not unlike what we've seen in other hamlets in the Donbas. [The Russians] will move in and then declare victory and then withdraw their troops only to let the Ukrainians take it back. So, there was a lot of back and forth over the last couple of days,' the official said.  Also, the Pentagon has observed that Russian forces seem to have a risk and casualty aversion in both the air war and the ground war, the official said.  Ukrainian forces continue to hold Kharkiv against nearby Russian forces. The city continues to endure Russian air strikes, the official said.  'But the Ukrainians have been doing an able job over the last 24 to 48 hours of pushing the Russians further away. And they have managed to push the Russians out about 40km to the east of Kharkiv,' the official said.  That's a good example of the stiff and formidable resistance Ukrainian forces are displaying, the official said.  Mariupol continues to get hit with standoff Russian air attacks. 'We continue to see them using dumb bombs in Mariupol,' the official said, referring to ordnance that's not precision-guided. The New York Times is also reporting that some evacuees have successfully arrived from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, on Monday. The group escaped the city in a convoy led by the International Committee for the Red Cross and the UN, the newspaper reports. 'For more than a month, more than 40 of us had to split six tins of food,' one evacuee said. ", "d32f1a66dae35632a8da93d7c312fd64b78468a375ce4a7c3de1e962": "A first group of civilians trapped for weeks inside Mariupol's Azovstal steelworks were expected to reach a Ukrainian-held city on Monday, but efforts to save more people from the horrific conditions inside the huge plant were held up. Hundreds remain trapped in underground bunkers and tunnels beneath the sprawling industrial site - the last stronghold of resistance to Russia's siege of the devastated southern port city - which Moscow's forces resumed shelling overnight. 'The situation has become a sign of a real humanitarian catastrophe,' Ukraine's deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said, with supplies of water, food and medicine fast running out. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said about 100 civilians should arrive in the city of Zaporizhzhia on Monday. 'For the first time in all the days of the war, this vitally needed green corridor has started working,' Zelenskiy said overnight. Some evacuees were initially taken to a village held by Moscow-backed separatists, but later allowed to continue to Ukrainian-held territory if they wanted. However, while the head of the Donetsk military administration said more evacuations under a UN/Red Cross plan were set to begin on Monday morning, by late afternoon the buses had not reached the agreed pickup point.  Mariupol's deputy mayor, Sergei Orlov, told the BBC that the evacuees were making slow progress and would probably not arrive in Zaporizhzhia on Monday as hoped for. Authorities gave no explanation for the delay. Later Reuters reported one group had arrived in the city but there were no details.  Speaking earlier from the Russian-controlled town of Bezimenne, evacuee Natalia Usmanova, 37, said after leaving the steelworks that she became hysterical whenever the bunker started to shake. 'I was so worried it would cave in - I had terrible fear,' she told Reuters, recalling widespread terror and a lack of oxygen underground. Some who were not sheltering in the steelworks also managed to escape without assistance. Anastasiia Dembytska said she took advantage of the brief evacuation ceasefire to leave with her daughter, nephew and dog. She said she had to cross countless checkpoints to reach Zaporizhzhia, waiting 18 hours outside before being allowed to pass.  'Our house is completely destroyed. We had a two-story building, it's not there anymore. It burned to the ground,' said Natalya Tsyntomirska, a Mariupol native who reached Zaporizhzhia on Monday in a funeral service van. A UN spokesperson, Saviano Abreu, said civilians arriving in Zaporizhzhia, about 140 miles (230km) north-west of Mariupol, would get immediate support, including psychological services. A Medecins Sans Frontieres team was already in place. There were no apparent plans to pull out the remaining Ukrainian forces still holed up in the plant, however, thought to number up to 2,000 and include members of the Azov regiment, the national guard, marines, border guards and other units. One of the steelworks' defenders, Denys Shlega, commander of the 12th Operational Brigade of Ukraine's national guard, said Russian forces resumed shelling the plant on Sunday evening as soon as the civilians were evacuated. Shlega said several hundred civilians remained trapped alongside nearly 500 wounded soldiers and 'numerous' dead bodies. 'Several dozen small children are still in the bunkers underneath the plant,' he said. Sviatoslav Palamar of the Azov regiment called for wounded fighters to be evacuated too. Mariupol, which is almost entirely held by Russian forces, is a key target because its capture would deprive Ukraine of a vital port, open up a land corridor to Crimea, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014, and free up troops for what has become the main focus of the invasion: achieving full control of the eastern Donbas region. Ukraine said on Monday it had formally closed the Black and Azov seaports of Kherson, Mariupol, Berdiansk and Skadovsk, all of which have been captured by Russian forces. The World Food Programme said about 4.5m tonnes of grain was stuck in Ukrainian ports. Ukraine's military command said on Monday Russia had redeployed several battalions from Mariupol to the heavily bombarded town of Popasna in the Luhansk province of Donbas, with the towns of Rubizhne, Sievierodonetsk, Slovyansk and Barvinkove also coming under heavy attack. 'I don't even want to speak about what's happening to the people living in Popasna, Rubizhne and Novotoshkivske right now,' said the Luhansk regional governor, Serhiy Gaidai. 'These cities simply don't exist any more. They have completely destroyed them.' Zelenskiy's office said on Monday at least three people were killed and another three, including a child, were wounded in Luhansk over the last 24 hours, with another four wounded in shelling in neighbouring Donetsk. Another two died in Orikhiv in the Zaporizhzhia region, farther west. Later on Monday, a teenage boy was killed and a girl was taken to hospital after a fresh Russian missile strike on a residential building in Odesa, the city council said. Western officials say Russia is advancing slowly in its eastern offensive and has captured some villages, but is inflicting heavy civilian casualties through indiscriminate bombing. Ukrainian forces are fighting village-by-village and have retaken ground in places. 'Everyone understands that we must hold the line here,' Lt Yevgen Samoylov of the 81st Brigade told Agence France-Presse as his unit rotated out of the frontline near the town of Sviatohirsk. 'We cannot let the enemy move closer. We try to hold it with all our force.' The UK defence ministry said more than a quarter of the 120 'battalion tactical groups' - about 65% of Moscow's total combat strength - deployed in Ukraine may be 'combat ineffective' due to personnel and equipment losses. 'It will probably take years for Russia to reconstitute these forces,' it said. Ukraine's defence ministry said its drones had destroyed two small Russian Raptor patrol boats in the Black Sea, while the governor of the Russian region of Belgorod reported two explosions in the early hours, the latest in a string of fires and blasts in recent weeks at ammunition stores and fuel depots in the area. A Russian rocket strike hit a strategically important bridge across the Dniester estuary west of the port of Odesa, authorities said, while Moscow claimed to have also destroyed an airport runway and a hangar containing western-supplied weapons and ammunition outside the south-western city. The UN human rights office said the death toll of civilians killed in Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion on 24 February had reached 3,153, although it said the real toll was likely to be considerably higher. Most victims were killed by explosive weapons, it said.", "a609b31ae22af6a59a40c0d4df69be4914ee61759cb7a5ed1a8b6dc9": "The UK home secretary, Priti Patel, is facing mass legal action over delays that have left thousands of Ukrainians at risk of trauma and Russian bombs, or in limbo in eastern Europe. A class action lawsuit is being prepared on behalf of hundreds of Ukrainians who applied to travel to the UK weeks ago but whose cases have been stuck in a 'chaotic' visa backlog, the Guardian has learned. Charities including Save the Children and the Refugee Council said the Homes for Ukraine programme must be overhauled urgently as it was endangering vulnerable children and adding 'trauma on top of existing trauma' since Russia's invasion. The chronic delays have been compounded by the Home Office approving many visas but failing to notify the successful applicants. The government admitted on Thursday it was aware of the problem after MPs from the across the Commons raised concerns about families waiting up to five weeks for news of their application. According to the latest government figures, 59,000 people have had visas approved but have not yet arrived in the UK. Only 15% of the 74,700 Ukrainians who applied under the sponsorship route have made it to Britain. A large number of those who have not yet arrived will be people waiting for other family members to receive their visas before travelling; children's applications usually take longer because the UK requires them to undergo security scans if they do not have their own international passport. However, a significant proportion of the 59,000 Ukrainians will be people who have had visas approved but have not been informed of the approval. Amanda Jones, an immigration and public law barrister, has been instructed to launch legal proceedings on behalf of 'many hundreds' of Ukrainians, in litigation organised by members of the groups Vigil for Visas and Taking Action Over the Homes for Ukraine Visa Delays. This could include mounting a judicial review case against the Home Office. Legal action is also being prepared on behalf of lone children who have been unable to access foster placements set up for them in the UK due to the visa delays. Anais Crane, a case worker at Wilsons Solicitors who is working with Here For Good Ukraine Project and representing several unaccompanied Ukrainian children, said they had been waiting longer than a month for a decision and were starting to give up hope. 'Many of them are now considering returning to Ukraine due to their precarious situations in Europe,' she said. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, described the delay between visas being approved and sent out as 'inexplicable and disgraceful' and urged the Home Office to disclose how many people had been affected and what steps it was taking to address the problem. She added: 'For families who have already fled war zones to then be stuck in limbo even longer because the Home Office can't even get its act together to notify people when the visas have been granted is appalling. Long delays are making families more vulnerable to exploitation.' Kirsty McNeill, an executive director at Save the Children and a former Downing Street adviser, said the red tape was increasing the danger for some of the 1.5 million children who had fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion on 24 February. She said: 'Part of [the government's] argument for the bureaucracy and the slowness is that it is keeping people safe. But actually it's a lack of pace that is endangering children more than anything.' The chief executive of the Refugee Council, Enver Solomon, said stories of women and children being stuck in dangerous situation were the 'dreadful but inevitable consequence' of an approach that was 'flawed from the start'. He said: 'Responding to what is clearly a serious humanitarian crisis with two visa routes ... was always going to result in paper and bureaucracy being put before people and their needs. Tragically, we are now witnessing the fallout of that approach.' The International Rescue Committee said the UK was 'an outlier' in Europe for requiring those fleeing war to apply for visas before they arrive. Ireland, which does not require visas for arrivals, has taken in roughly the same number of Ukrainians as the UK despite its population being a thirteenth of the size of Britain's. A government spokesperson said: 'In response to Putin's barbaric invasion we launched one of the fastest and biggest visa schemes in UK history. Over 86,000 visas have been issued so Ukrainians can live and work in the UK. 'The changes the Home Office has made to streamline the visa system, including simplifying the forms and boosting staff numbers, are working and we are now processing visas as quickly as they come in - enabling thousands more Ukrainians to come through our uncapped routes.'", "a21d78571d0201c5b8e2a1d629b7fabf51e25aa8e1abd2923f1c4e1c": "Israel has summoned the Russian ambassador and demanded an apology over remarks by the Kremlin foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, that Adolf Hitler 'had Jewish blood' and that the 'most rabid antisemites tend to be Jews'. The remarks were part of Lavrov's defence of Russia's policy of 'denazification' in Ukraine, the Kremlin's term for a sweeping purge that Ukraine says is a pretext for 'mass murder.' In an interview with Italian TV, Lavrov was asked to address how Russia could say it needed to 'denazify' the country when its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is Jewish. 'As to [Zelenskiy's] argument of what kind of nazification can we have if I'm Jewish, if I remember correctly, and I may be wrong, Hitler also had Jewish blood,' Lavrov said during an interview with Italian television channel Mediaset. 'It doesn't mean anything at all.' 'We have for a long time listened to the wise Jewish people who say that the most rabid antisemites tend to be Jews,' Lavrov continued. 'There is no family without a monster.' The remarks have sparked a diplomatic row with Israel, one of the few western countries that has yet to impose sanctions on Russia over its invasion and has not provided military aid to Ukraine. 'His words are untrue and their intentions are wrong,' said the Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett. 'Using the Holocaust of the Jewish people as a political tool must cease immediately.' Yair Lapid, Israel's foreign minister, said Israel made 'every effort' to have good relations with Russia 'but there is a limit and this limit has been crossed this time. The government of Russia needs to apologise to us and the Jewish people.' He said: 'Foreign Minister Lavrov's remarks are both an unforgivable and outrageous statement as well as a terrible historical error. Jews did not murder themselves in the Holocaust. The lowest level of racism against Jews is to accuse Jews themselves of antisemitism.' Israeli officials confirmed Russia's ambassador, Anatoly Viktorov, had been summoned to the foreign ministry and Israel had 'stated its position'. In his nightly video address, Zelenskiy said Lavrov's comments showed that Moscow has forgotten, or never learned, the lessons of the second world war. 'No one has heard any denial or any justification from Moscow. All we have from there is silence ... this means that the Russian leadership has forgotten all the lessons of world war two,' he said. 'Or perhaps they have never learned those lessons.' World leaders also condemned the remarks, which the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, described as 'obscene' and Canada's Justin Trudeau said were 'ridiculous and unacceptable.' Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskiy, called Lavrov's statement 'antisemitic' and said that it was 'further evidence that Russia is the legal successor of Nazi ideology'. 'Trying to rewrite history, Moscow is simply looking for arguments to justify the mass murders of Ukrainians,' he said. Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust memorial, also condemned Lavrov's remarks as 'absurd, delusional, dangerous and deserving of condemnation'. The organisation in March had also attacked Zelenskiy for comparing Russia's intentions in Ukraine to the Holocaust. Lavrov has addressed Zelenskiy's religion in the past as Moscow has been pressed to explain how it can 'denazify' a country with a Jewish leader. In March, shortly after Russia began its war in Ukraine, Lavrov told US broadcaster ABC News: 'I think the Nazis and neo-Nazis manipulate [Zelenskiy].' In his interview this week, Lavrov also said he did not want Ukraine to surrender but simply that it 'stop resisting'. 'We don't demand that [Zelenskiy] surrender,' Lavrov said. 'We demand that he give the order to release all civilians and stop resisting. Our goal does not include regime change in Ukraine.' Italy's Mediaset TV channel also came under fire for giving space to Lavrov, with Enrico Letta, the leader of the centre-left Democratic party, describing the exclusive interview on the current affairs programme Zona bianca as 'a propaganda advert'. Laura Garavani, a senator with the small Italia Via party, said the interview, conducted by Giuseppe Brindisi, 'was an offensive spectacle for a democracy like ours. The network acted as a sounding board for Russian propaganda by letting Lavrov speak undisturbed, denying the crimes he is committing without any cross-examination'. Ruth Dureghello, the president of the Jewish Community of Rome, said Lavrov's statements were 'delusional and dangerous', and that their most serious aspect was that they were made 'on Italian television, without any cross-examination and without the presenter opposing the lies that were uttered'. 'This is unacceptable and cannot be allowed to pass by in silence,' she added.", "bb012f37f7f1ac82bd6a4fece8733fe822291132d78a833c143723b7": "Russia's Bolshoi theatre has upset opera and ballet fans by abruptly cancelling shows this week by directors who have spoken out against the war in Ukraine. The theatre gave no reason for dropping Timofey Kulyabin's production of the opera Don Pasquale and Kirill Serebrennikov's ballet Nureyev, which will be replaced by productions of Rossini's The Barber of Seville and Aram Khachaturian's ballet Spartacus. Serebrennikov, 52, was allowed in March to leave Russia, where he was found guilty in 2020 of embezzling funds at Moscow's Gogol Centre theatre. His supporters say the conviction was revenge for his criticism of authoritarianism and homophobia under the country's president, Vladimir Putin. Serebrennikov said he was not surprised by the Bolshoi's cancellation of Nureyev, which is based on the life of the Russian ballet superstar Rudolf Nureyev, who defected to the west in 1961. The work, which includes a tender scene with his gay lover that tested the Kremlin's stance towards what it calls 'homosexual propaganda', has caused outrage among Russian conservatives. 'This ballet is about man's yearning for freedom. Freedom to create and freedom to live,' Serebrennikov told Agence France-Presse. 'These days Nureyev is inappropriate and impossible on the Bolshoi stage. They are afraid of unnecessary associations and uncomfortable artists,' Serebrennikov added. He called the cancellation a throwback to the Soviet era. 'Nureyev was cancelled at the Bolshoi theatre. Cancellation of Russian culture in Europe, you say? In Russia, they themselves are cancelling culture.' Kulyabin, who has also left Russia, used his Instagram account to express solidarity with Ukraine and ridicule Russia's description of its actions there. In one post, he showed a mocked-up version of the cover of Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace, replacing the first word of the title with 'Special Operation', the term the Kremlin has used to describe the invasion. 'It's quite obvious that Russia started the war,' Serebrennikov told France 24 in an interview last month and said it was breaking his heart. 'It's war, it's killing people, it's the worst thing [that] ever might happen with civilisation, with mankind ... It's a humanitarian catastrophe, it's rivers of blood,' he said. The Bolshoi performed Spartacus in early April, saying that proceeds would be used to help the families of Russian troops who died in Ukraine. The cancellation of the two shows drew hundreds of mostly critical online comments from ticket holders. Many demanded in vain to know the reason. 'What disrespect to the spectators and artists!' one woman, Valeria, wrote on the Bolshoi's Telegram channel. Several dancers have in recent weeks quit the Bolshoi, including the prima ballerina Olga Smirnova.", "483bdc52a81e0212943c3fa5e4f5f512fecf768948eecab335fab2e2": "It has been four weeks since 12-year-old Diana Demchyna was taken in darkness across the Ukrainian border to Poland on the first leg of her journey to Britain. Her parents, who cannot leave Ukraine due to their work, had arranged for Diana to live with her relative, Olenka Pevny, in the UK until the war was over. Pevny, a professor at the University of Cambridge, was assured twice by the Home Office that Diana would be able to come to Britain under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. She filed the paperwork on 24 March and flew to Poland the following week to collect her young relative. They have been waiting there ever since. Diana's application is among tens of thousands stuck in a byzantine system that charities say is worsening the trauma of those fleeing war. Pevny, 58, said she faced the prospect of having to send Diana back to Ukraine as she could no longer afford to stay in Poland. 'It cannot be right for a 12-year-old girl to leave a war zone and then, because the UK has a glitch in their visa scheme, have to go back to a war zone where Russians are committing war crimes against children and mothers,' she said. 'We're reading about all these mothers and children, who are Diana's age, who are being raped around Kyiv. Can I actually as a human being return this child to Ukraine?' Pevny was told twice by the Home Office to apply to host Diana under the Homes for Ukraine scheme because, as a distant relative, she would not qualify as a close family member, although they are incredibly close as families and celebrate all their holidays together. But weeks after submitting an application under Homes for Ukraine, she found out that the rules had changed so that unaccompanied under-18s could not be brought to Britain. The safeguarding reasons behind this may be sound, but the change was not publicised or communicated to Pevny, who only found out when her MP, Daniel Zeichner, looked into her case. She now faces another long wait as her application is rerouted to the family scheme, with no prospect of success. Pevny said Diana was 'traumatised' by the process: 'She thinks that the UK does not want her. She thinks that I will leave her in Poland or send her back to the war zone. There must be a better way for the UK to help innocent children who are victims of the Russian war of aggression.' Charlie Richards, a market research consultant, has found himself managing visa applications on behalf of 22 Ukrainians who fled their homeland when Russia invaded. The group consists of six families of people aged from three years old to 70. They are scattered across Europe as they approach their sixth week of waiting for the green light to travel to the UK. Richards, 35, discovered on 4 April that more than half of his 22 applicants had been approved for visas but had not received them. He learned this only because Home Office officials visited a Ukrainian cultural centre near his home in Reading, so he asked them to check the status of their applications. They had been approved, some weeks ago, but never sent. He was astonished; the Home Office officials looked concerned. They came back four days later after looking into the issue. 'They recognised it was a problem,' Richards said. The government only officially acknowledged the problem on Thursday, the day parliament was prorogued. Potentially thousands of people could have arrived in the UK weeks ago if their visas had been dispatched as soon as they had been approved. Three of Richards' cases received visas 16 days after they were authorised. But that family are still in limbo halfway across Europe because three of their group are still waiting for their paperwork. Richards said the UK had 'fundamentally let down a group of people we should have been there for as a country'. He added: 'When you see that tens of thousands of people have supposedly been granted visas but haven't got here yet, it's impossible not to think the problem could be that widespread.' Alexandra, a Ukrainian refugee, said she was at a loss to understand why she has had to wait six weeks for a straightforward visa application to be processed. She fled Kherson and her visa application was lodged on the day the scheme opened, 18 March. 'I feel like it's a joke and a game from government for us,' she said. 'It makes me so mad, the suspense and zero information. I don't think they realise what we have been through.' Since fleeing Kherson with only her passport and a few items of clothing, Alexandra has been on a dangerous journey passing through Russia, Turkey and Bulgaria to get to Romania, where she is waiting for her visa to come through. A home is waiting for her in Warwickshire, where she has been sponsored by Daniel Edwards. But still the wait goes on. 'I've exhausted so many different options trying to get in touch with MPs, the Home Office helpline, the visa office but there are still no results and no hope,' said Edwards. 'The woman I'm sponsoring has been on such a dangerous journey from border to border. The visa should have arrived at least four weeks ago. It's an absolute disgrace that it's now more than 40 days since the original application.'", "b4277403be614030b6e8ec174abbc7d5d580ef731b5f94bb4dc9efa9": "Cowering in the labyrinth of Soviet-era bunkers far beneath the vast Azovstal steelworks, Natalia Usmanova felt her heart would stop as Russian bombs rained down on Mariupol, sprinkling her with concrete dust. Usmanova, 37, spoke on Sunday after being evacuated from the plant, a sprawling complex founded under Joseph Stalin and designed with a subterranean network of bunkers and tunnels to withstand attack. 'I feared that the bunker would not withstand it - I had terrible fear,' Usmanova said, describing the time sheltering underground. 'When the bunker started to shake, I was hysterical, my husband can vouch for that. I was so worried the bunker would cave in.' She recalled the lack of oxygen in the shelters and the fear that had gripped the lives of people hunkered down there. 'We didn't see the sun for so long,' she said, speaking in the village of Bezimenne in an area of Donetsk under the control of Russia-backed separatists about 30km east of Mariupol. Usmanova was among dozens of civilians evacuated from the plant in Mariupol, a southern port city that has been besieged by Russian forces for weeks and left a wasteland. She said she joked with her husband on the bus ride out, in a convoy agreed by the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross, that they would no longer have to go to the lavatory with a torch. 'You just can't imagine what we have been through - the terror,' Usmanova said. 'I lived there, worked there all my life, but what we saw there was just terrible.' Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said about 100 civilians, primarily women and children, were expected to arrive in the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia from the plant on Monday. 'For the first time in all the days of the war, this vitally needed (humanitarian) corridor has started working,' he said in an address published on Telegram. He said he hoped the evacuations would continue on Monday. People fleeing Russian-occupied areas in the past have described their vehicles being fired on, and Ukrainian officials have repeatedly accused Russian forces of shelling evacuation routes on which the two sides had agreed. As many as 100,000 people may still be in blockaded Mariupol, including up to 1,000 civilians hunkered down with an estimated 2,000 Ukrainian fighters beneath the Soviet-era steel plant - the only part of the city not occupied by the Russians. Mariupol has been a key target for Vladimir Putin because of its strategic location near the Crimea Peninsula, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014. Reuters and the Associated Press contributed to this report", "1c9ae13e653dcc0c090bd4d03ead27405fe9c7548b573cb27fa63ca4": "Elderly residents trapped at a nursing home near the frontline of war in eastern Ukraine are to be evacuated thanks to donations from a fundraiser held thousands of miles away in New Orleans in the US. Ukrainian-born Katya Chizayeva, who now lives in the Louisiana city, organised the event at a restaurant after reading in the Guardian about the plight of residents at the facility in Chasiv Yar, a Donbas village just kilometres away from the frontline. A total of $8,000 (PS6,351) was raised for the nursing home. Without the means to leave, elderly people have borne the brunt of the fighting in the Donbas over the last eight years. The situation only worsened when Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February. When the Guardian visited the nursing home in April, most of the residents interviewed had been made homeless by the shelling. The nursing home's director, Ievhen Tkachov, said they are in the process of evacuating the last 12 people - a mixture of those who are bedridden and new residents they have received because of the fighting nearby. 'The biggest chunk of the money will go towards making the accommodation suitable for the old people,' said Tkachov. Tkachov started searching for a place to move the residents when the war started. Having lived under the Russian-backed separatists, Tkachov said they had to leave. 'I know there will be no water, no electricity, no heating, no medicine. This lot will become a mass grave in a matter of days,' said Tkachov, referring to his vulnerable residents. 'We have to go.' Over a month ago he wrote a post on Facebook as he panicked about approaching Russian soldiers. Russian forces have not made much progress along the entrenched 2014-2022 eastern frontline where Chasiv Yar sits. But in the first weeks of the war, they captured swathes of territory to the north and east, encircling Ukrainian-controlled Donbas. A local church in the Khmelnytskyi region of western Ukraine contacted Tkachov. They asked the local authorities for help and a disused school was allocated for the elderly evacuees. Tkachov and his team are in the process of renovating it. So far, they have evacuated more than 30 people to the school. 'We are going to buy a boiler to make it warmer,' said Tkachov, explaining how the money would be spent. 'At the moment it's suitable for a student who comes in for half a day and then goes home but our people will be there full-time.'' 'We want to buy some special beds, they cost around $500,' said Tkachov. Tkachov said the donation had made a big difference, though he lamented the exchange rates. 'There's another nuance,' he said. 'From the $8,000, we only received $7,200 thanks to the [Ukrainian]) state currency exchange system.'", "a888ff8dc0cb2a410c95adb47fc900081ca5b5c1ad6152db7eafbeb3": "The Spanish government has said the mobile phones of the prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, and the defence minister, Margarita Robles, were both infected last year with the Pegasus spyware that its manufacturers claim is available only to state agencies. In a hastily convened press conference on Monday morning, Felix Bolanos, the minister for the presidency, said Sanchez's phone was targeted in May and June 2021, while Robles's was targeted in June 2021. Data was extracted from both phones. Bolanos said the 'illicit' and 'external' targeting would be investigated by Spain's highest criminal court, the Audiencia Nacional, adding the targeting must have come from abroad as any such monitoring in Spain would have had required judicial authorisation. 'These facts have been confirmed and are irrefutable,' said Bolanos. 'I don't think now is the time to engage in supposition or conjecture about what the motivation may have been.' The phones of other members of the government are being examined to determine whether they may also have been targeted. The allegations come as the Spanish government faces questions over how Pegasus - which is sold by the Israeli company NSO Group - allegedly came to be used to monitor dozens of members of the Catalan independence movement, including the president of the north-eastern Spanish region, Pere Aragones, and three of his predecessors. Last month, Aragones told the Guardian the alleged targeting, revealed by Citizen Lab cybersecurity experts, constituted a violation of individual rights, an attack on democracy, and a threat to political dissent. The Catalan regional government has pointed the finger at Spain's National Intelligence Centre (CNI), which insists its operations are overseen by the supreme court and that it acts 'in full accordance with the legal system, and with absolute respect for the applicable laws'. The Spanish government has promised an internal CNI investigation into the alleged targeting of Catalan activists, while Spain's public ombudsman has also opened an independent investigation. Aragones has called for Robles - who oversees the CNI as defence minister - to resign, and his Catalan Republican Left party has threatened to withhold its support for the government in the national parliament. The Catalan president said in a statement: 'Any political espionage is extremely serious. We reported spying a few days ago but were not given an explanation by the Spanish government. When it's massive spying on Catalan institutions and the independence movement, it was all silence and excuses. With this, it's all moving very fast. Responsibility needs to be established straight away. A thorough, independent investigation remains urgent and responsibility needs to be taken.' NSO Group said in a statement it would investigate 'any suspicion of misuse' of its software, and would cooperate with any governmental investigation. 'While we have not seen any information related to this alleged misuse and we are not familiar with the details of this specific case, NSO's firm stance on these issues is that the use of cyber tools in order to monitor politicians, dissidents, activists and journalists is a severe misuse of any technology and goes against the desired use of such critical tools,' said a spokesperson. 'NSO is a software provider; the company does not operate the technology nor is privy to the collected data. The company does not and cannot know who the targets of its customers are, yet implements measures to ensure that these systems are used solely for the authorised uses.' NSO Group claims Pegasus is sold only to governments to track criminals and terrorists. A joint investigation two years ago by the Guardian and El Pais established that the speaker of the Catalan regional parliament and at least two other pro-independence supporters were warned the spyware had been used to target them. NSO group was placed on a US blacklist in November 2021, three months after a consortium of journalists working with the French non-profit group Forbidden Stories revealed multiple cases of journalists and activists who were hacked by foreign governments using the spyware, including American citizens. The Guardian and other members of the consortium also revealed that the mobile numbers of Emmanuel Macron, the French president, and almost his entire cabinet appeared on a leaked list of individuals who were selected as possible targets of surveillance. NSO has said its spyware is used by foreign government clients to target serious criminals. It has also denied that any of its clients ever targeted Macron or any French government officials.", "21d7b1a9136a4ef88c1daa7a167438d7f615577b6dcfa52a27d3e8d7": "", "d7098fcfa77f8cc4fa17ceba915e8a3d5a683ecefd695ce30843e644": "In the first months after Covid emerged, doctors were baffled by rare and severe responses to the virus in some children, whose symptoms included lung disease, blood clotting and heart damage. Two years later and researchers led by the Murdoch Children's Research Institute [MCRI] in Melbourne have uncovered the proteins involved in these acute inflammatory responses in children. MCRI haematology researcher Conor McCafferty said blood samples were taken from 33 children affected by either multi-system inflammatory syndrome or acute respiratory distress syndrome after they contracted Covid-19. Children with Covid-19 who develop multisystem inflammatory syndrome often suffer from fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, skin rash, heart disease or conjunctivitis. Children who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome may suffer organ damage due to a lack of oxygen in the blood. These blood samples were compared with samples from 20 healthy children. 'What we were doing was trying to look at all of the proteins in their blood,' McCafferty said. 'So a lot of people hear about genomics, which is looking at all of the genes in the body. We were doing proteomics, which involved looking at all of the proteins in the blood so we could try and map out what was happening.' They found the children affected by the syndromes contained specific proteins in their blood not seen in the healthy children. 'Our research was the first to uncover the specific blood clotting and immune protein pathways impacted in children with Covid-19 who developed these serious symptoms,' McCafferty said. The findings were published in the journal, Nature Communications, on Monday, with researchers discovering 85 proteins specific to multisystem inflammatory syndrome and 52 linked to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Knowing the specific proteins involved could improve diagnosis and lead to the development of targeted treatments for children suffering from severe Covid-19 cases. Currently, children affected are treated with intravenous immunoglobulin from donated blood, which reduces their chance of developing heart issues from one-in-four, to one-in-20. Children who do experience changes to their heart often see the issue resolve as they get older. About 1.7% of children hospitalised with Covid-19 are admitted to intensive care. Most children who contract Covid-19 have mild or no symptoms. The syndromes are so rare in Australia that researchers were sent blood samples taken from Covid-19 infected children with the syndromes receiving treatment at the Necker university hospital in France. 'France had the blood samples, while we had the proteomic testing capacity here in Melbourne,' McCafferty said. 'This kind of collaboration is one of the silver linings to emerge from Covid-19.'", "9b2f27579d9d11fdf6a7825a62646d9a0cf1808be662076d25d62a6d": "The House select committee investigating the 2021 US Capitol attack asked three Republican members of Congress on Monday to assist its inquiry, as it seeks to establish the extent of their roles in Donald Trump's attempt to overturn the 2020 election. The panel sent letters requesting voluntary cooperation to Mo Brooks, Andy Biggs and Ronny Jackson, three congressmen who strategised ways to stop certification of Joe Biden's election win or appeared to have connections to elements involved in the Capitol attack. Bennie Thompson, the Democratic committee chair, told the Guardian last week the panel wanted to conduct interviews with Republicans so it could consider their testimony for its report, due to be published in September. The panel opted against issuing subpoenas compelling testimony in the first instance, since that could cause the Republicans to attack, whereas an informal interview might at least yield some information, two sources close to the matter said. House investigators are expected to issue further letters to Republican members of Congress, sources said. The Guardian first reported the committee was considering letters to Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert and Paul Gosar, in addition to Biggs and Brooks. But the select committee appeared forced to confront the issue of subpoenas to compel cooperation head-on after all three Republican members of Congress announced in statements that they would not provide any assistance to the 6 January inquiry. Biggs rejected the investigation as 'illegitimate and Democrat-sympathizing' while Jackson denounced the 'illegitimate Committee's ruthless crusade against President Trump and his allies' - hours after a Trump-appointed judge ruled that the panel was legitimate. Brooks also refused: 'At one time I would have voluntarily testified before the Nancy Pelosi witch hunt committee provided the testimony was in public, the questioners were congressmen, and the questions were limited to events related to January 6. But that time has long passed.' The panel made a particularly expansive request to Biggs, the former head of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, outlining four lines of inquiry that investigators want to pursue with respect to his role in the weeks before 6 January. Thompson told Biggs the committee wanted to ask him about a crucial 21 December meeting at the White House between Trump and dozens of Republicans, which produced a plan to have the then vice-president, Mike Pence, refuse to certify Biden's win. The letter also said the panel wanted to ask what Biggs knew of plans to stage a march from the Ellipse, near the White House, to the Capitol on 6 January, through his purported contacts with the pro-Trump activist Ali Alexander, who led the 'Stop the Steal' movement after the 2020 election. Biggs's potential contacts with Alexander are of special interest to the investigation, the sources said. The committee is trying to untangle claims by Alexander that he 'schemed up putting maximum pressure on Congress while they were voting' with Brooks, Biggs and Gosar, and his testimony that he spoke to Biggs's staff and the congressman himself. Alexander obtained a permit for a 6 January rally near the Capitol. But the rally never took place - although a separately organised event did - and Alexander was instead filmed going up the Capitol steps with members of the Oath Keepers militia group. Thompson said the panel also wanted to ask Biggs about his efforts to pressure legislators to create 'alternate' slates of electors for Trump in states he lost, as well as an alleged request he made to Trump for a pardon in the days after the Capitol attack. 'The select committee has learned that several of our colleagues have information relevant to our investigation,' Thompson said in a joint statement with the panel's vice-chair, Liz Cheney. 'We urge our colleagues to join the hundreds of individuals who have shared information.' In a letter to Brooks, the select committee said it wanted to ask him about his recent public comments, how Trump supposedly asked him on several occasions to 'help rescind the election' and that 'we've got to take Joe Biden down and put me in now'. In the letter to Jackson, the panel indicated they would ask Trump's former White House physician about why his name came up in encrypted text messages among members of the Oath Keepers as the Capitol attack was under way. According to text messages in a recent court filing, an unidentified Oath Keeper messaged a group chat in the afternoon of 6 January that 'Ronnie [sic] Jackson (TX) office inside Capitol - he needs OK help. Anyone inside?' The same Oath Keeper provided an update less than 10 minutes later: 'Dr Ronnie Jackson - on the move. Needs protection. If anyone inside cover him. He has critical data to protect.' The Oath Keepers leader, Stewart Rhodes, responded: 'Give him my cell.' The extraordinary exchange raises the notion that members of the Oath Keepers - two of whom are among those who have been indicted on charges of seditious conspiracy for storming the Capitol - were close enough to Jackson to know his whereabouts and condition in real time. To that extent, the letter to Jackson said, the select committee wants to ask him about whether he had contacts with the Oath Keepers, how the militia group could have known that he needed protection or, in another text, knew he had 'critical data to protect'.", "7a5003317f757d707c8690c308d368967f4ddac69e43c579be46d3ef": "A multi-billion dollar cryptocurrency company has apologised to users after its sale of 'metaverse land' sparked a frenzy that temporarily overwhelmed the Ethereum cryptocurrency. Yuga Labs, the company behind the Bored Ape NFTs beloved of Jimmy Fallon and Paris Hilton, announced the sale of its latest tokens - representing plots of land in a forthcoming multiplayer game called Otherside - on Sunday. A total of 55,000 plots were sold, at a flat price of 305 ApeCoin (a currency created by Yuga), which is worth about PS4,500 at current exchange rates. Demand for the plots was so high that it overwhelmed the Ethereum blockchain, one of the layers of infrastructure that all cryptocurrency projects rely on to operate. As users raced to be one of the lucky few able to secure an 'Otherdeed', transaction fees on the network rose higher and higher, until an individual NFT purchase cost more than PS2,500 in fees alone. One user, who successfully secured two Otherdeeds, paid a transaction fee of over 5 ETH (PS11,000) on top of the PS9,000 to buy the land itself. Others lost thousands of pounds failing to secure the tokens at all: if a user runs out of money while paying the transaction fees, the transaction fails, but the fees aren't refunded. For most of those who secured Yuga's latest token, the eye-watering fees have paid off, at least in the short term: tokens that sold for PS4,500 are already reselling for more than PS9,000. But people who were unlucky enough to be trying to carry out other cryptocurrency business at the same time have racked up hefty losses. Molly White, a cryptocurrency expert who runs a site chronicling the sector, tracked multiple examples over the day of NFT sales worth less than PS500 being hit with transaction fees of more than PS2,000. 'Gas fees, which increase based on network congestion, spiked to shocking levels,' White wrote. While most sales on OpenSea, the most popular marketplace for NFTs, were for Otherside deeds, 'some people oddly continued to buy and sell cheaper NFTs', she added. In total, more than $100m was spent on transaction fees to buy Otherside NFTs, while Yuga Labs took another $300m in payments. When the sale was over, the company apologised for the chaos it had caused. 'We know that the Otherdeed mint was unprecedented in its size as a high-demand NFT collection, and that would bring with it unique challenges. 'This has been the largest NFT mint in history by several multiples, and yet the gas used during the mint shows that demand far exceeded anyone's wildest expectations. The scale of this mint was so large that Etherscan crashed,' Yuga added, referring to a cryptocurrency analytics website. 'We're sorry for turning off the lights on Ethereum for a while.' The company had already faced one crisis thanks to the Otherdeed sale: a fake post on its hacked Instagram page, announcing free metaverse land, led to a phishing campaign that stole $3m worth of NFTs. Some argued that the ramifications of such a comparatively small sale was evidence that the cryptocurrency sector would struggle to scale to provide services to the mainstream. 'There's much talk about the promise of web3. But at this rate, any non-web3 sales mechanism works with ~100x less wasted fees,' wrote Gergely Orosz, a prominent technology commentator. 'If it's too expensive to use, or it's unreliable: this is something alpha at best, not ready for mainstream use.'", "1221e82cba9066e300c5a7bf2e38ba73f0233b3c8dc4774dd8281fea": "A reckoning for Donald Trump over his efforts to overturn his presidential election defeat in Georgia is a step closer after the seating of a special grand jury in Atlanta.

Amazon warehouse workers in New York overwhelmingly rejected a union bid on Monday, the Associated Press reports, the opposite result from that at another Staten Island facility last month that saw employees embrace the company's first union representation. Workers cast 618 votes, or about 62%, against the union, giving Amazon enough support to fend off a second labor win, and raise questions as to whether the first victory was a fluke, the agency said. According to the National Labor Relations Board, 380 workers, or 38%, voted in favor of the grassroots union. Turnout was 61%, with about 1,600 workers eligible to vote, according to a voter list provided by Amazon.  The result is a massive blow to organizers and could stall a nationwide drive for union representation for Amazon workers.  The outcome is still pending of a union election in Bessemer, Alabama, while more than 400 challenged ballots are analyzed. Hearings to review those ballots are expected to begin in the coming weeks.  Jen Psaki said Joe Biden will be more vocal in the run up to November's midterm elections, after she was asked if immigration and inflation issues, and the president's low approval ratings, were weighing on the White House. But she denied any 'course correction' was needed, despite polls predicting Democrats could lose control of both chambers of Congress to Republicans in six months time: The White House is previewing tomorrow's visit by Joe Biden to a missile manufacturing facility in Alabama that has been supplying weapons to support Ukraine's resistance to the Russian invasion. The president will visit the Lockheed Martin plant in Troy in support of his request to Congress for an additional $33bn in military, economic and humanitarian aid to Ukraine. The White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at her afternoon briefing that Biden will deliver remarks about the security assistance the US is providing, including Javelin anti-tank missiles produced at the Troy factory: Psaki said Biden will also speak to the need for Congress to get the bipartisan innovation act to his desk: How can we explain that even those Republicans who openly stand against Donald Trump seem unwilling to support the necessary steps to strengthen democracy?  Earlier this month, Liz Cheney described Russia's attack on Ukraine as a 'reminder that democracy is fragile' and talked about her obligation 'to defend our democracy' - yet she doesn't seem overly concerned with her party's escalating voter suppression or gerrymandering efforts.  Similarly, Mitt Romney warned his audience at a private fundraiser in mid-March that 'preserving liberal democracy is an extraordinary challenge' - yet he helped block legislation in the Senate that would have introduced much-needed national standards for voting rights.  In general, the few Republican lawmakers in Washington who are opposing the worst excesses of Trumpian authoritarianism have been strikingly unwilling to oppose the ongoing Republican attempts to subvert democracy on the state level.

Amazon is terminating its Covid-19 paid sick leave policy from today, according to a memo to employees seen and reported by CNN. The online shopping giant is reverting to its pre-pandemic policy of five days excused but unpaid leave following a positive test, the network says. Previously, employees with Covid were entitled to seven days of paid leave. In the memo, CNN says, Amazon cited the 'sustained easing of the pandemic, ongoing availability of Covid-19 vaccines and treatments, and updated guidance from public health authorities'. Accrued time off can be applied for a Covid-19 related absence, the company said, while Amazon says it will no longer notify workers of positive cases in its facilities unless required by law.  'We are monitoring conditions closely and will continue to adjust our response as appropriate,' the memo said, adding that Amazon would also discontinue its vaccine incentive program. As CNN notes, the easing of the company's pandemic-era policies comes amid heightened workplace activism at Amazon and multiple high-profile unionization efforts.  Workers at a Staten Island, New York, warehouse voted to form the company's first union last month, and the count is under way for unionization at a second facility in the borough.

Axios reports that in a forthcoming book, the former defense secretary Mark Esper writes about how Donald Trump wanted to shoot anti-racism protesters in the legs. Esper reportedly writes that the moment 'was surreal, sitting in front of the Resolute desk, inside the Oval Office, with this idea weighing heavily in the air, and the president red faced and complaining loudly about the protests under way in Washington DC'. Esper was fired by Trump after the 2020 election. His book, A Sacred Oath: Memoirs of a Secretary of Defense in Extraordinary Times, is due out next week. Trump's wish to shoot protesters has been reported before, by Michael Bender, then of the Wall Street Journal, in his own Trump book last year.

Alex Male, 29, of Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, is alleged to have been a regional distributor of class A drugs across the south-west of England, using an EncroChat encrypted communications network. He was detained at Lisbon airport after arriving on a flight from Turkey where he had been refused entry, according to the National Crime Agency. Male, who was added to the NCA's most-wanted list in January, is accused of conspiracy to supply cocaine and ketamine, money laundering and conspiracy to acquire a firearm as part of his alleged drug-dealing activity between April and June 2020. He had been on the run after failing to adhere to the bail restrictions imposed after his arrest and was previously thought to be in the Marbella area of Spain before moving to Portugal. The NCA international liaison officer, Phil Robinson, said: 'Male naively believed he could travel across international borders using fraudulent documentation and remain undetected by law enforcement. But he underestimated the vigilance and expertise of the Turkish border police, which enabled the Portuguese authorities to act. 'Any arrest of a fugitive is a fantastic result, even more so since Male had only recently been added to our most-wanted list. 'He is wanted in connection with dangerous crimes, which have a devastating impact on communities, so I'm delighted he has been caught. We continue to work with our international partners to close the net around fugitives, no matter where they are.' Male, who was initially detained at Lisbon airport on Saturday, remains in custody and will face extradition proceedings. DI Adrian Hawkins of the south-west regional organised crime unit said: 'Male will now be returned to the criminal justice system in the UK to face the charges he ran away from.

The wood-framed La Borda scheme of 28 apartments and several shared spaces has won the prestigious Mies van der Rohe prize for emerging architecture for a project that the awards committee described as 'a transgressive ... model based on co-ownership and co-management of shared resources and capacities'. The occupants had been there barely a year when lockdown came, which was when the communal plan of the building really came into its own, says Cristina Gamboa, a leading figure in the field of sustainability who, with Pol Massoni, was the principal architect. Once it became clear that none of the occupants had Covid it was possible to make use of the shared spaces - including a kitchen-dining area, laundry, multipurpose space, guest rooms as well as a patio, bike parking and terraces - to minimise the sort of isolation suffered by people in more conventional housing. 'It was a privilege to live through Covid here,' Gamboa says. 'It showed that these spaces allow for the sort of interaction that wouldn't be possible in a conventional apartment block. For example, the guest rooms couldn't be used because no one was travelling so they became work spaces.' Unlike the experiments in communal living in London squats such as St Agnes Place and Villa Road in the 1980s and 90s, which were carried out in family houses, La Borda is designed with the collective in mind. Since Covid restrictions were lifted, every Wednesday about two-thirds of the occupants have been meeting for dinner in the communal dining room. 'La Borda is exemplary in terms of design for home-based work, a rare thing in social housing,' says Frances Holliss, architect and author of Beyond Live/Work: the Architecture of Home-based Work. 'Homes can be expanded to include a workspace - on a different floor, if preferred. The building is designed at every turn to increase social interactions and build community, which reduces social isolation - the bane of the home-based worker.' The La Borda project emerged from a local campaign to reclaim the abandoned industrial complex at Can Batllo in the Sants area of the city for use by the community, which in turned spawned Lacol, a collective of young architects interested in developing participative projects. Inspired by housing schemes in Denmark and Uruguay, as well as figures from the 1970s such as the Belgian architect Lucien Kroll, Gamboa and her colleagues at Lacol were motivated by three principles: sustainability, participation and community. 'Our model is for accessible, not speculative housing, but we also wanted to create something easy to replicate, not a closed community,' says Gamboa, who lives in the building. The design, with its large internal patio and light well, harks back to the 'corral' concept common in Madrid and southern Spain, where the central space serves as both a meeting place and natural air conditioning. The timber construction allows the flats to be adaptable while also improving insulation and minimising environmental impact. 'It's a passive building with active participants,' Gamboa says. Co-op members, who range from people in their 20s to retirees, don't own their flats, nor can they sell or pass them on. Rent and living costs are about 30-35% below market rates. Solar panels supply electricity to communal areas while a shared laundry keeps bills lower and frees up living space. Prospective members pay a refundable fee of EUR18,500 (PS15,485) but with 50 people already on the waiting list, Gamboa says the only solution is to build more. Only 1.5% of Barcelona's housing stock is public and the rest is increasingly out of reach of most pockets, especially the young, with the result that around 80% of 18- to 30-year-olds still live with their parents. Gamboa says winning the Mies van der Rohe award was a surprise, adding that 'it's great to see other ways of doing architecture receiving recognition'. Some of the EUR20,000 prize money will go towards a celebratory dinner for the occupants and others involved in bringing the project to fruition.", "4f7c041ac3be5b7eca67d7bd65d2a90b94525b7e925975f713933d18": "", "cb80a13a9587b56fdfa3cb1d4b19c10e1d36238fad48e420029f97c7": "The award-winning Guardian photographer David Levene offers tips on how to get a good picture. Be bold and get close to your subject rather than shooting from afar - that may either make your subject too insignificant in the frame or mean that unwanted elements creep in to your composition. If you are super-close, then try using wide-angle lenses, which might make your images feel more dynamic. Get creative with shooting angles: see how your subject looks from down low, or find a high vantage point from which to shoot down. Check out alternative points of view rather than just accepting what you see before you. As obvious as it sounds, it is worth remembering that photography is dependent on light and, in general, good-quality light will help you to produce more impactful imagery. Sure, golden hour (the period just after sunrise or just before sunset) can be beautiful but you might find more interesting conditions just before sunrise or after sunset, as the blue evening shade mixes with the orange and yellow glows of urban night-lighting. If you are using a standalone camera, see if you can operate it on fully manual, or semi-automatic, modes and experiment with different apertures and shutter speeds. Soften the background (if you are relatively close to your subject) by shooting with a wide aperture, such as f2.8. Experiment with long shutter speeds, perhaps even moving the camera while exposing your photograph, to see what kind of results you can get. If you are using a phone camera, you should be able to switch off the automatic flash, and may be able to override other settings, too. Invest in better lenses to see an immediate improvement in your photographs. Beyond the 'kit' lenses that might come as standard with your camera, you will find better contrast and sharpness with fixed focal length or better-quality zoom lenses. 'Fast' lenses (those that achieve a wider aperture) will also allow you to shoot more effectively in lower light conditions. All modern DSLR and mirrorless cameras (and even some smartphones) will allow you to shoot raw files (such as CR2, NEF or DNG). These retain far more information than Jpegs, which compress files by discarding information and detail. You will need more memory card space and hard drive storage but your images will have far more scope when it comes to processing them. Experiment with some of the basic adjustment tools in programmes such as Photoshop, Lightroom or Capture One to find ways to enhance your images. Tools such as exposure, shadow detail (HDR), clarity and vignetting can do wonders for your photographs (particularly if you're shooting in raw). Don't overdo it, though.", "ddbeee69fadeedd0f5a7782395f042b9d7a648ee5ec51263ac9959c2": "", "05c2083e01c8e63de1af3d200661a6a2a9162d1d97a9f66adedf2f9e": "", "667a67bb829297b1fbc6fe728811a95179e8b74df2eefd4ea05eb856": "Sandra Castaneda spent 19 years in prison for a murder she didn't commit. But when the California courts overturned her conviction in July 2021, the 40-year-old Los Angeles woman did not walk free. Instead, she was picked up by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents and taken to a federal detention center where she is now facing deportation to Mexico, a country she left at age nine. Castaneda has been in Ice detention for nine months, trapped in a Kafkaesque legal nightmare in which lawyers for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Ice, argue she should be deported due to the original murder charge even though the California courts and an immigration judge have said that her conviction was invalid. 'I'm stuck here. There's nothing to do all day and I get overwhelmed,' Castaneda said in a recent call from inside a detention center in the state of Georgia. 'It's like nothing applies to [Ice]. They can do whatever they want. It makes me angry ... I'm just wasting time here.' Immigrants' rights advocates say her case is extraordinarily unjust - but far from unique. The US has long deported immigrants based on their criminal records, routinely detaining people convicted of a wide range of offenses, leading people like Castaneda, who have legal status, to be threatened with removal. But as the US justice system reckons with its past and various states have passed reform laws meant to right the wrongs of mass incarceration and unjust convictions, the immigration system has not caught up. That means that across the US tens of thousands of people over the years have faced deportation even after courts have overturned their convictions, granted expungements and erased the offenses from their criminal records, legal experts estimate. And in recent years, the US government has actively thwarted new state reforms meant to fix this problem and stop deportations based on flawed convictions. 'There's discrimination baked into the system at every level,' said Andrew Wachtenheim, supervising attorney with the Immigrant Defense Project (IDP), an advocacy group that has challenged US deportation policies. 'You have very racist state criminal laws that have been doing damage to communities of color for decades ... and now you finally have some localities facing those injustices and enacting desperately needed legislation to alleviate the consequences, but for non-citizens, the reforms aren't happening. It's a second level of injustice.' Castaneda, who came to the US with a green card in 1991, grew up in South Central LA, a neighborhood that struggled with gang violence. She had a difficult childhood, with her mother leaving her to live with relatives at a young age, but she stayed out of trouble until 10 May 2002. Castaneda, then 20, was driving a group of friends to a restaurant that evening when one of them, who was affiliated with a local gang, fired without warning at a rival gang, injuring one person and killing another, her attorneys wrote in a recent filing. The passengers and shooter in the car all fled on foot, but Castaneda stopped a few blocks away, and was apprehended by police. Prosecutors did not allege that she took part in the killing or had any role in planning it, but she was convicted of murder and attempted murder under the state's 'felony murder rule', which at the time dictated that anyone involved in a felony when a death occurs can face the same consequences as the person who committed the act. At age 21, Castaneda, who had no criminal record, was given a life sentence with the possibility of parole after 40 years. The shooter was never charged. 'I had mentally prepared myself to die in prison, as a lifer ... so I tried to do good for myself and for others,' said Castaneda, who got multiple degrees while incarcerated and served as a mentor, peer educator and advocate for terminally ill people behind bars. In recent years, officials across the California criminal justice system recognized the injustice of Castaneda's conviction and her achievements: in 2019, the head of the California department of corrections recommended her sentence be reduced; in 2020, Governor Gavin Newsom commuted her sentence altogether, giving her an opportunity at early parole; and in 2021, a judge ruled that her conviction be entirely dismissed and she be immediately released, based on a new California law that dismantled parts of the felony murder rule due to concerns about unjust murder sentences for people not responsible for the deaths.  On 27 July last year, the day she was scheduled to come home, California prison guards handed her over to Ice. Colby Lenz, an advocate with the California Coalition for Women Prisoners, who has known Castaneda for years, was waiting outside to pick her up and watched as an Ice van drove her away. 'It was totally devastating, especially knowing that she was about to face a really long struggle and more horrible conditions in detention.' Ice officers initially told Castaneda that she would be released home to her family, with an ankle monitor, because Ice had no available bed in California: 'I was so happy, I was finally going to go home to my family.' But later that day, the Ice officer said, ''I found you a spot - you're going to Atlanta,'' she recalled. 'I just started crying. I couldn't believe they would send me to the other side of the country. All my support is in California. I don't have nobody in Georgia.' There's no good data on deportations after convictions were invalidated, but immigration lawyers say it's been a common occurrence for decades and continues to emerge when states enact new reforms. The challenges stem from a US Department of Justice ruling in the late 1990s and early 2000s, dictating that if a non-citizen's conviction was dismissed due to a 'procedural or substantive defect in the underlying criminal proceedings' (such as a straightforward wrongful conviction uncovered by DNA), then the individual would no longer be deportable. But if someone's conviction was erased due to 'rehabilitation' or certain other reforms, the standards hold they should still be deported. That decision applies to many non-citizens across the country who get their records expunged every year, including people who have successfully completed probation and other programs, and people who got old marijuana cases and related charges tossed out due to reform measures meant to address the 'war on drugs'. Those expungements wipe an individual's record clean, removing barriers to housing and employment, but the DoJ considers them irrelevant for most immigration purposes. 'As far as the state is concerned, these convictions are invalid and don't exist, but folks are still getting detained and deported,' said Anoop Prasad, an Asian Law Caucus (ALC) staff attorney representing Castaneda. Last year, for example, a New Jersey human trafficking survivor still faced deportation even after her convictions were dropped once she proved in state court that she was victimized.  California, New York and other states have passed laws in recent years to help people dismiss convictions and ensure they are protected from deportation, but the federal government has fought to circumvent them. 'Every criminal legal reform that we've passed, I've seen federal immigration attorneys attempt to argue that those reforms don't pass muster in immigration court. It's infuriating,' said Rose Cahn, senior staff attorney at the Immigrant Legal Resource Center (ILRC). For months, this has been the case for Castaneda. In October 2021, US lawyers argued that her 'conviction remains a conviction for immigration purposes'. An immigration judge sided with Castaneda in November and said he did not believe she was deportable, though last week called for another hearing on the matter. And although Castaneda's lawyers have obtained further documentation from a California judge making clear she no longer had a deportable offense, DHS is still fighting to remove her - and refusing to release her on bond as she fights her case. Immigrant advocates are pressuring the Biden administration and state officials to do more to stop deportations of people with dismissed convictions and old criminal records.  A coalition of advocates has urged Biden's attorney general, Merrick Garland, to restore a rule undone by the Trump administration that enabled some immigrants to avoid deportation if their criminal sentences were retroactively lowered. Some offenses are only deportable if the sentence is a certain length. Trump's attorney general, William Barr, reversed this longstanding precedent in 2019. So far, the Biden administration has declined to change the rule or enact policies directing immigration officials to broadly recognize conviction dismissals. Spokespeople for the DoJ and White House declined to comment, and representatives of Ice and the DHS did not respond to inquiries about Castaneda's case and the related deportation policies. Activists in California have also fought to stop the state from transferring people from prisons to Ice, arguing that states have the discretion to end the practice and that people who served their time should not face further punishment. So far, the governor has refused; Castaneda was one of 2,600 people handed over to Ice from California prisons from January 2020 through November 2021, according to data obtained by ALC. (The governor's office did not respond to an inquiry.) Castaneda, thousands of miles from her family, doesn't know what will happen if she loses her case: 'I don't see myself in Mexico. It's hard for me to face the fact that I might have to go, because I don't know a life there.' After all of the acknowledgments of her accomplishments behind bars, Ice's refusal to even release her on bond has weighed on her: 'They say I'm a 'safety risk for the public', and it frustrates me, because you're focusing on my first charges. They're not seeing the good things I've done. What else do you want?' Once released, she has dozens of family members and friends ready to support her in LA and a non-profit advocacy job lined up. Her message to the Biden administration? 'Give us a second chance, allow us to do it right, to prove ourselves. The laws are changing, but it's only on paper. They don't honor that. They don't honor the fact that you have family here. Check our records and you can see we tried to change our lives. Don't just send us back to what we don't know.'", "29c0a1e0d2aa94a2e36931bcfa0e8b1b97a703ab6c97664c79e87065": "", "5814ea5560fbb71f45e1853c6cf4ce88674ed2c2fb9ffe5c967b65a8": "The night that six Cambodian police officers dragged Prum Chantha's teenage son out of their home for criticising the government in a group chat, she was so distraught that her neighbours insisted on sleeping on her floor to watch over her. Her husband was already one of more than 100 activists and politicians charged with alleged treason or incitement against Cambodia's ruling party. Now Kak Sovannchhay, a 16-year-old with autism whose crime was defending his father on Telegram, would join him in Prey Sar prison. But within a week, Chantha returned to the ritual she had started a year earlier, walking the streets of Phnom Penh with her petition. 'I can't be weak. I have to stand up for myself,' says Chantha.For two years, she has led a group of women - sometimes just a dozen - to picket Phnom Penh's courts and international embassies, facing arrest and violence as they demand the release of their family members. Chantha's son, who was arrested in June 2021, came home after five months in prison but her husband is still awaiting his case, one of four mass trials against opposition leaders and supporters that many see as Prime Minister Hun Sen's attempt to stamp out growing dissent to his 37 years of rule. Chantha's group, a rare voice of defiance in Cambodia, are known as the 'Friday wives' for their weekly protests. 'Physically, they're putting their lives and their bodies on the line,' says Theary Seng, a Cambodian-American lawyer and activist who is facing her own ongoing court proceedings. 'Here are 20 women with no weapons, holding signs, wearing T-shirts of their loved ones, being assaulted left and right.' On a sweltering April morning the women wore wide-brimmed hats and white T-shirts bearing photos of their jailed family members as they marched down a busy road to sit on the grass verge outside the Australian embassy in Phnom Penh. On 3 May, the closing arguments are expected at a hearing for about 60 of 130 activists whom the state has been prosecuting since 2020.  The protests follow a familiar arc: they rally in front of the municipal court or royal palace before delivering a petition to one of many embassies. 'We're looking for democratic countries and signatories,' Chantha says. She has already met embassy officials from the US, Indonesia, the UK and the EU.  When they first began, in June 2020, the Friday wives were very nervous, say Ouk Chanthy, a garment worker whose husband is serving a 44-month prison sentence. He was one of 20 people handed sentences of up to 10 years in mid-March. 'I didn't know how advocacy works,' she says. 'The first time I joined the protest, I was scared the authorities would threaten me.' Police have shoved and kicked the women countless times, threatened them with arrest and have violently removed them from public spaces. They meditate together before each protest and call out constant words of encouragement. The day her husband was convicted, two guards confronted Chanthy as she held up his photo and dragged her along the ground until her palm bled. 'I used to feel scared,' she says, touching the place where she has a pale scar. 'They have threatened us, pushed us, pulled us, until all my fear was gone.' Mu Sochua, an exiled opposition leader, has watched the women from afar as they grew from a group of strangers to an unflinching mutual support network. Their message has also expanded to broader themes of democracy and freedom of expression. 'It's very clear that they have moved beyond fighting for themselves and their husbands - they have moved toward justice for all,' says Sochua. 'Listening to their interviews, I hear that they don't consider themselves as victims, but as real players, real leaders in bringing change.' The group bears more than physical scars: members of Chantha's family have blocked her on Facebook and on mobile phones to avoid being targeted by the authorities by association. Many of the women have struggled to find people who will employ them. Chantha can afford to visit her husband once a week, squeezing her protests between trekking to the prison, caring for her son and helping her niece sell clothes. But she has no plans to stop. 'It's unacceptable that families are subject to threats and intimidation,' she says. 'The authorities assault us, shoot us, hit us, arrest us and threaten us - yet we cannot even criticise them.'

The hoped-for gold rush lies thousands of miles away on the bed of the Pacific Ocean, where trillions of potato-sized nodules of rare earth elements vital to power the next generation of electric cars have been discovered 4,000m below the surface. Mining companies are hoping that global rules to allow industrial scale deep-sea mining to collect the haul could be set in place as early as July 2023. However, environmental campaigners warned that mining for the metals would be 'dangerous', 'reckless' and cause 'irreversible harm' to little-known ecosystems. One estimate suggests that 90% of the deep-sea species that researchers encounter are new to science. Louisa Casson, a Greenpeace campaigner, criticised the industry for running the conference and banks for considering investing in the 'dangerous and unnecessary' projects to 'make a quick profit'. 'This destructive new industry wants to rip up an ecosystem we are only just starting to understand,' she said. '[They are] aiming to make a quick profit while our oceans and the billions of people relying on them bear the costs.' The nodules in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone between Hawaii and Mexico were first discovered by the crew of HMS Challenger in 1875, but only recent developments in underwater robotics have made large-scale mining of the metals possible. The UN-affiliated organisation that oversees the controversial new industry has granted licenses for companies to explore the area, but full-scale mining has yet to start. That could soon change, however, as the tiny Pacific island nation of Nauru has triggered a 'two-year rule', giving the International Seabed Authority (ISA) two years to implement regulations governing the industry. That set a deadline for a roadmap to be adopted by 9 July 2023. 'Deep-sea gold rush is a gamechanger,' read adverts for the Deep Sea Mining Summit 2022 at the Hilton London hotel in the capital's Canary Wharf district, for which delegates paid PS1,195 for the two-day event this week. 'After years of negotiations and false starts, deep-sea mining is close to a breakthrough. 'As we move into an era of mining the deep-ocean floor, the world's most remote environment, mining companies are working on overcoming the perceived challenges and developing island nations are watching with interest. As the demand for base metals and minerals surges ever beyond what our land is able to provide, new technological and technical developments are helping to drive forward this new industry.' Daniel Wilde, economic adviser on oceans for the Commonwealth Secretariat, which represents Nauru and many of the other small island states keen to start seabed mining, told the conference that he expected the ISA to agree a payment regime that would hand mining companies a post-tax profit of 17.5%. However, he warned the audience that 'the two-year deadline does seem quite tight, [and] if it's not agreed there are questions about what happens next'. Ebbe Hartz, a geologist at Aker BP, a Norwegian oil exploration company part-owned by BP, said mining for seabed metals could eventually overtake drilling for oil. 'But the problem is going to be finding [the metals], and we don't have a lot of data.' Hartz said machine-learning data collection would be key to the success of seabed mining, and would ensure 'we don't need to make all the errors we made with hydrocarbons'. Eleanor Martin, a partner at law firm Norton Rose Fulbright who advises banks on financing offshore projects, said global banks were 'very eager' to invest in deep-sea mining projects as they project the cost of lithium and cobalt needed for electric car batteries will continue to spiral upwards. 'To build the number of [electric] cars we will need, we will need much more of these metals.' 'Banks are sitting on pots of green money,' she said in reference to money designated for projects aimed at tackling the climate crisis. 'But they need to know that mining projects are green and sustainable.' Katherine Reece Thomas, an associate law professor and director of public international law at City, University of London, warned the industry that it needed to do more to win over public opinion before planning to start mining the oceans. 'There is an impossible conflict between those who say we can't possibly do this, to others who say we need to take this stuff in order to tackle climate change on earth,' she said. Jessica Battle, who runs the WWF's No Deep Seabed Mining campaign, said: 'Deep-seabed mining is highly risky and will cause irreversible harm to the ocean, to its life and its ability to help mitigate climate change. Investing in such a highly unsustainable industry at a time when we need to reduce our footprint on the natural world is irresponsible. 'Any short-term incentives offered are far outweighed by the long-term benefits of a healthy ocean and so WWF and others are calling for a global moratorium on deep seabed mining. Alternative solutions already exist - innovation, recycling and repair can satisfy industries' need for raw materials without opening the seafloor to mining.'  Casson, from Greenpeace, said: 'There is absolutely no need to mine the deep oceans and cause further harm to our planet. We've been pleased to see the biggest players in the electric car and technology sectors, including Microsoft, Google, Volvo, BMW and Samsung, all call out the greenwash of the deep-sea mining companies and commit not to use deep-sea mined minerals in their products. 'This nascent industry should stop before it even begins. We need to transition towards a more circular economy, in which we waste less and reuse more, instead of trying to destroy one of our planet's last great wildernesses at the bottom of our oceans in the name of profit.'", "901af344da38b73dd7882ce77c52c0a7ce32d4aa7141fd710f17fbd2": "There will be at least 15,000 instances of viruses leaping between species over the next 50 years, with the climate crisis helping fuel a 'potentially devastating' spread of disease that will imperil animals and people and risk further pandemics, researchers have warned. As the planet heats up, many animal species will be forced to move into new areas to find suitable conditions. They will bring their parasites and pathogens with them, causing them to spread between species that haven't interacted before. This will heighten the risk of what is called 'zoonotic spillover', where viruses transfer from animals to people, potentially triggering another pandemic of the magnitude of Covid-19. 'As the world changes, the face of disease will change too,' said Gregory Albery, an expert in disease ecology at Georgetown University and co-author of the paper, published in Nature. 'This work provides more incontrovertible evidence that the coming decades will not only be hotter, but sicker. 'We have demonstrated a novel and potentially devastating mechanism for disease emergence that could threaten the health of animals in the future and will likely have ramifications for us, too.' Albery said that climate change is 'shaking ecosystems to their core' and causing interactions between species that are already likely to be spreading viruses. He said that even drastic action to address global heating now won't be enough to halt the risk of spillover events. 'This is happening, it's not preventable even in the best case climate change scenarios and we need to put measures in place to build health infrastructure to protect animal and human populations,' he said. The research paper states that at least 10,000 types of virus capable of infecting humans are circulating 'silently' in wild animal populations. Until relatively recently, such crossover infections were unusual but as more habitat has been destroyed for agriculture and urban expansion, more people have come into contact with infected animals. Climate change is exacerbating this problem by helping circulate disease between species that previously did not encounter each other. The study forecast the geographic range shifts of 3,139 mammal species due to climatic and land use changes until 2070 and found that even under a relatively low level of global heating there will be at least 15,000 cross-species transmission events of one or more viruses during this time. Bats will account for the majority of this disease spread because of their ability to travel large distances. An infected bat in Wuhan in China is a suspected cause of the start of the Covid pandemic and previous research has estimated there are about 3,200 strains of coronaviruses already moving among bat populations. The risk of climate-driven disease is not a future one, the new research warns. 'Surprisingly, we find that this ecological transition may already be under way, and holding warming under 2C within the century will not reduce future viral sharing,' the paper states. Much of the disease risk is set to center upon high-elevation areas in Africa and Asia, although a lack of monitoring will make it difficult to track the progress of certain viruses. 'There is this monumental and mostly unobserved change happening within ecosystems,' said Colin Carlson, another co-author of the research. 'We aren't keeping an eye on them and it makes pandemic risk everyone's problem. Climate change is creating innumerable hotspots for zoonotic risk right in our backyard. We have to build health systems that are ready for that.' Experts not involved in the research said the study highlighted the urgent need to improve processes designed to prevent future pandemics, as well as to phase out the use of the fossil fuels that are causing the climate crisis. 'The findings underscore that we must, absolutely must, prevent pathogen spillover,' said Aaron Bernstein, interim director of the center for climate, health, and the global environment at Harvard University. 'Vaccines, drugs and tests are essential but without major investments in primary pandemic prevention, namely habitat conservation, strictly regulating wildlife trade, and improved livestock biosecurity, as examples, we will find ourselves in a world where only the rich are able to endure ever more likely infectious disease outbreaks.' Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, a nonprofit that works on pandemic prevention, said that while human interference in landscapes has been understood as a disease risk for a while, the new research represents a 'critical step forward' in the understanding of how climate change will fuel the spread of viruses. 'What's even more concerning is that we may already be in this process - something I didn't expect and a real wake-up call for public health,' he said. 'In fact, if you think about the likely impacts of climate change, if pandemic diseases are one of them, we're talking trillions of dollars of potential impact. 'This hidden cost of climate change is finally illuminated, and the vision this paper shows us is a very ugly future for wildlife and for people.'", "8f956548187371633f9967b98f10fefa28b19036315f6c12ff2792f6": "More than a fifth of all reptile species are threatened with extinction, which could have a 'devastating' impact on the planet, a new study warns. The largest ever analysis of the state of the world's reptiles, published in Nature, found that 21% of reptile species are facing extinction. From lizards to snakes, such a loss could have disastrous impacts on ecosystems around the world, the study says. 'We would lose a combined 15.6bn years of evolutionary history if each of the 1,829 threatened reptiles became extinct,' said Neil Cox, co-leader of the study and manager of the biodiversity assessment unit at the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and Conservation International. 'This is evolution that we could never get back. It would be a devastating loss. 'If we remove reptiles, it could change ecosystems radically, with unfortunate knock-on effects, such as increases in pest insects,' he added. 'Biodiversity, including reptiles, underpins the ecosystem services that provide a healthy environment for people.' Fifty-two experts analysed data from the Global Reptile Assessment, which has received contributions from more than 900 scientists across six continents in the past 17 years. While 1,829 of 10,196 species are known to be threatened, the status of 1,489 could not be determined. Allowing for these data deficient species, the authors estimate that, in total, 21% are threatened. The study was led by NatureServe, the IUCN and Conservation International. Although many reptiles live in arid environments such as deserts and scrubland, most species occur in forests, where they suffer from threats such as logging and conversion of land for agriculture. The study found 30% of forest-dwelling reptiles are at risk of extinction, compared with 14% in arid habitats. The king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah), for example, listed as globally 'vulnerable', is declining across much of its range in Asia, largely due to the loss of forest habitat. Hunting is also a major threat to reptiles, especially turtles and crocodiles, many of which are at risk of extinction. Another major contributing factor is the introduction of invasive species. Like birds or freshwater fish, reptiles tend to be less popular than iconic species of land mammals or marine life, but more reptile species are threatened than birds, suggesting more work is needed to protect them, said Mike Hoffmann, head of wildlife recovery at the Zoological Society of London, and one of the scientists involved with the study. 'From turtles that breathe through their genitals to chameleons the size of a chickpea and giant tortoises that can live to more than 100, they're utterly fascinating. Our hope is that this first-ever assessment of the world's 10,000-plus reptiles helps put them in the spotlight and goes some way to highlighting this diversity, and just how much we have to lose.' As well as controlling rats, mosquitoes and other 'pests', reptiles deliver many other benefits. 'They help disperse seeds, especially in island environments,' said Hoffmann. 'We've also achieved many medical advances from studies of reptiles. Snake venom, for example, has resulted in critical drug discoveries, including for treating hypertension. 'The impending loss [of reptile species] could lead to wide-ranging and unforeseen impacts on our environment and our own wellbeing.' In Australia, home to about 10% of the world's species, reptiles face a growing number of threats. 'Most of Australia's threatened reptiles have declined due to habitat loss and predation by invasive cats and foxes,' said Nicki Mitchell from the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Western Australia, who also contributed to the study. 'Climate change is an emerging threat to species confined to small fragments of habitat, as the microclimates they occupy will change and may no longer be optimal for a population to thrive.' The study is not all doom. Scientists noted that conservation efforts to help other animals are likely to be protecting reptile species as collateral. 'We found, surprisingly, that if you set out to protect places where threatened birds, mammals and amphibians live together, you'll simultaneously protect many more threatened reptiles,' said Bruce Young, co-leader of the study, and chief zoologist and senior conservation scientist at NatureServe. Yet reptiles also require direct, global, efforts to protect them, said Cox. The UN Convention on Biological Diversity is scheduled to convene Cop15's second phase in Kunming, China, later this year, where governments will negotiate new targets to protect biodiversity, including reptiles.  'We need solid conservation plans, global policy agreement, and to have countries fully invest in turning around the looming biodiversity crisis if we are to prevent the ongoing extinction catastrophe,' he said.

The proposals, released for consultation on Wednesday, outline sweeping reforms to institutions, councils and laws to try to stop people building in hazardous areas, preserve cultural treasures, improve disaster responses, protect the financial system from the shocks of future disasters, and reform key industries including tourism, fisheries and farming. 'The climate is already changing and there will be some effects we cannot avoid,' climate change minister James Shaw said. 'Just in the last few months we have seen massive floods, such as those in Tairawhiti; storms, such as those experienced recently in Westport; fires in the Waituna wetlands in Southland; and droughts right across the country.' 'These events demonstrate the case for urgent action on climate change - action to protect lives, incomes, homes, businesses and infrastructure.' Over the last year, some New Zealand communities have been repeatedly hit by devastating flooding. In March, Tairawhiti was hit with its second destructive flood in less than a year. Flood waters damaged homes, schools and infrastructure, with residents saying it would 'take about a year to clean up'. Last year, flooding in Westport left 450 homes unliveable or damaged. At the forefront of the plan is the challenge of how to adapt New Zealand's cities and housing stock - much of which is coastal - to the risk of rising seas and flood waters. According to the government, the scale of the problem is enormous: 675,000 people - one in seven New Zealanders - live in areas prone to flooding, amounting to nearly $100bn worth of residential buildings. Another 72,065 live in areas projected to be subject to extreme sea level rise. 'The number of people exposed to these hazards will increase as the climate changes,' the report says. It found that between 2007 and 2017, the contribution of climate change to floods and droughts alone cost New Zealanders an estimated $840m in insured damages and economic losses. Those figures present a huge, looming problem for homeowners, who face losing their ability to insure their homes as the risk level rises, and for local and central government, which have been met with furious revolt by some communities when trying to shift them away from hazards. The government's proposed changes, include updating the building code to make sure new builds account for climate hazards, ensuring the country's public housing stock is built away from hazards, creating incentives for development away from high-risk areas and making it compulsory to disclose information about climate risks to prospective buyers and builders. Some of those measures are likely to cause unease for homeowners, who are worried that climate risk assessments could tank the value of their homes. Shaw was clear that the government would not be picking up the bill for all such changes. 'Central government does not bear all the costs,' he said. 'The consultation asks how best to share risks and costs between property and asset owners, insurers, banks and local government as well.' The draft National Adaptation Plan outlines the actions the government will take over the next six years to respond to climate-related risks. It also includes proposals for protecting important cultural sites, such as coastal marae [maori meeting houses], and to adapt government-funded infrastructure to take climatic heating into account. It also covers proposed reforms of the tourism sector to ensure international visitors 'contribute to resilient, adaptable infrastructure and the natural environment they use' - possibly through an arrival fee or other taxes on tourists. Prof Bronwyn Hayward, of University of Canterbury, said via the Science Media Centre that the plan 'shows the enormity of the task facing the government after years of inaction'. 'We now need to implement climate planning guidelines across a raft of new legislation, and we need to think carefully about how people are exposed to repeated flooding effects - and I'd add fires - in the future. If homeowners, businesses, schools, ports or airports have to move away from a high-risk area for example, who pays?' Prof Anita Wreford, of Lincoln University, said that the plan was 'well overdue' and 'an improvement from New Zealand's current approach to hazards, which has been very reactive and focused on recovery after an event'. But she said the proposals were still very high level, and needed to provide 'much more guidance for decision-makers'. 'I suspect groups waiting in anticipation for this ... may have hoped for more concrete direction in implementing adaptation to achieve these goals.' The plan will be open for public consultation before the proposals are finalised by the government. 'Aotearoa will soon have a plan to bring down our emissions and help prevent the worst effects of climate change,' Shaw said, 'But we must also support communities already being hit by more extreme and more frequent weather events.'", "1f4b27e4465b86429fc910520b1688316cfe60da5fe8ba5e0607420d": "The largest active wildfire in the US has forced thousands from their homes in New Mexico, as unusually fast-spreading blazes dot the drought-stricken south-west. The blaze, dubbed the Calf Canyon fire, has consumed more than 121,000 acres (49,000 hectares), or more than half the area of New York City, tearing through centuries-old settlements and vacation homes in forested mountains 30 miles (48km) north-east of Santa Fe. The blaze is burning in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains near the small city of Las Vegas, where evacuation orders have been issued, along with several other New Mexican villages. Fire officials said they expect the blaze to keep growing, putting the fire on track to be one of the most destructive in the state's recorded history. Fierce winds have blown embers beyond the fire, allowing it to breach containment lines set by about 1,000 firefighters backed by aircraft and bulldozers. 'This emerging situation remains extremely serious and refusal to evacuate could be a fatal decision,' said the office of emergency management of San Miguel county, where Las Vegas is located. The Calf Canyon fire is the largest of about a dozen major fires in the south-west spurred by strong winds and parched conditions. Scientists say the climate crisis is turning wildfires into a year-round risk for much of the US west, with high temperatures drying out soils and turning vegetation into kindling. More than a million acres have already burned across the US since the start of this year, more than double the total for the same period last year, according to the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC). 'Climate change is taking a situation that would be bad for us normally,' said Gregg Garfin, a climatologist at the University of Arizona, 'and turning the dial up'. The Calf Canyon fire started on 6 April when a prescribed burn set by firefighters to clear out small trees and brush that can fuel fires spun out of control. The blaze merged with another fire a week ago. In north-west Las Vegas, families packed trucks with boxes of photos and heirlooms and loaded livestock onto trailers, heeding police warnings for residents to get out of the area. David Lopez, 31, chose to stay and defend his family's two trailer homes, wetting down the earth with a hose and raking away dead grass to create a fire break. 'This is all I have - I worked really hard for it,' said the 31-year-old mechanic, who said he planned to flee once flames got within a quarter of a mile of him. Samuel Coca, general manager of a bar in the town's Castaneda hotel, told the New York Times he had packed his belongings in case he and his family needed to flee and had also met others who had to leave more quickly. 'The first dozen people I spoke with lost everything,' Coca said. 'They lost their houses, their ranches, some livestock. It was hard to get through the afternoon without crying.' High temperatures and erratic winds kept the fire spreading at 'dangerous speeds and in different directions,' the Santa Fe national forest, administered by the US Forest Service, said in an alert. 'This is a long-term event and we don't anticipate having 'control' of this fire any time soon,' it said, adding that strong winds were expected most days for the next two weeks. As fire approached from the north and west, the university town of 14,000 staggered evacuations, with another 4,000 to 5,000 people on standby to go, said San Miguel deputy county manager Jesus Romero. The state psychiatric hospital in Las Vegas evacuated 197 patients to other facilities, the New Mexico health department tweeted. The fire has so far destroyed hundreds of properties and forced the evacuation of dozens of settlements in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, but there have been no reports of fatalities.", "bdff16bf695856b47d7a2210adc90acb38f0d4badcc76f44486893c3": "A 'highly enterprising' four-year-old boy was reunited with his parents unscathed after grabbing his mother's keys and taking her car for an early-morning drive through the streets of Utrecht in the Netherlands, police have said. The boy, in pyjamas and bare feet, was spotted wandering on a street in the city's Overvecht district early on Saturday morning by bystanders who called emergency services, the North Utrecht police force said on its Instagram account. After receiving a medical check-up and a cuddly bear from an ambulance crew, the toddler - with no immediate sign of any parents in the vicinity - was taken to the nearest police station and given a mug of hot chocolate, the post said. Soon afterwards, a police patrol reported that a car had been abandoned in the same neighbourhood, apparently after first colliding with two parked vehicles. A call to the registered owner of the car revealed it to be the boy's mother. 'She explained that her son was 'highly enterprising',' police said. 'She spoke to the child on the phone, and we saw him imitate a collision and make a steering movement with his hands. This made us suspect he might have been driving.' Officers accompanied the mother and her son to the abandoned car, where they were joined by the boy's father. 'At the car, we asked the child if he could show us how it worked,' Utrecht police recounted in their Instagram post. 'He opened the car, and put the key in the ignition. He started the car, moved his left foot to the clutch, and hit the accelerator.' They concluded that he had been 'woken up early when his father left to go to work, and decided to go for a drive'. Fortunately, police said in their post - titled 'New Max Verstappen discovered in Overvecht', in a reference to the 2021 Belgian-Dutch Formula One world champion - 'this mini boy-racer's adventure ended with a fizzle'.", "20617596946439e8ca0d044e024a5d4abf15bd2960da777e0864581f": "", "2274f248f63f604dc0a0693a67695f8fedde0754196f41e5381cf835": "Deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda is unlikely to deter those in northern France hoping to cross the Channel in small boats, according to a survey that found that three-quarters said they would still try to make the journey. The snapshot survey of more than 60 asylum seekers in Calais and Dunkirk was carried out by the charity Care4Calais, which provides practical support to asylum seekers in both northern France and across the UK. When the UK government announced plans to offshore some asylum seekers to Rwanda on 14 April, ministers emphasised that the controversial scheme would act as a deterrent to asylum seekers planning to cross the Channel in small boats. Asylum seekers who talked to Care4Calais said they were still prepared to take their chances. 'I'm willing to risk it,' said one. 'Everyone is scared in the camp but I don't think it will affect them [the decision to cross the Channel].' Many of those interviewed fled Sudan or South Sudan and were horrified at the prospect of being flown back to a country not far from the starting point for their journey, especially after enduring the difficulties of passing through Libya, where many had to deal with traffickers, and making the dangerous crossing across the Mediterranean to Italy. 'Rwanda is not good. It's for animals, we take danger to get a safe life,' said another asylum seeker who participated in the survey. On Sunday, more than 250 people crossed the Channel in small boats after an 11-day pause due to poor weather, although the government claimed the absence of these crossings was evidence that its Rwanda plan was already having a deterrent effect. The most recent crossings, prior to Sunday's resumption of small-boat activity on the Channel, was on 19 April, when 263 people crossed in seven boats. More people thought to be migrants were taken to Dover on Bank Holiday Monday, including children, with the BBC reporting that more than 100 migrants had been brought to shore by the afternoon. The offshoring plans are the subject of several legal challenges including one from Care4Calais, PCS and Detention Action. They are challenging the failure to publish details of the policy and the government decision to penalise asylum seekers based on irregular entry to the UK. Care4Calais has launched a crowdfunder for the legal action and has condemned the impact of the plans on asylum seekers on both sides of the Channel. The charity is one of several to raise the alarm that since the government announced its plans to offshore people to Rwanda dozens of asylum seekers are reported to have gone missing from hotels across the UK where the Home Office is accommodating them, because they are fearful of being rounded up and put on a plane to Rwanda. Sam Jonkers, a volunteer at Care4Calais, knows of some refugees who have vanished from hotels and says she has been deluged with text messages from asylum seekers fearful of being offshored. 'The Rwanda plans are devastating for people who have left such dangerous countries and had such difficult journeys to reach the UK,' she said. 'I have received hundreds of text messages from terrified asylum seekers; they can't sleep at night because they are so worried.' One message states: 'I couldn't sleep. So frightened about what we expect to happen to us in the coming days with the Rwanda decision.' Another said: 'I now think there is no such thing as human rights anywhere in the world, Neither in Iran, UK or anywhere.' While about a quarter of respondents to the Care4Calais survey in northern France said the Rwanda offshoring announcement would make them consider staying in France and seeking asylum there, many said they would continue with their plans to reach the UK. Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, condemned the impact on asylum seekers in the UK of the Rwanda announcement, saying: 'The government is failing in its duty of care to people in the asylum system by not recognising the devastating impact the threat of being expelled to Rwanda is having on them.' He said the government was simply treating asylum seekers it hoped to offshore as 'human cargo'. Maddie Harris, of the Humans for Rights Network, is also aware that some asylum seekers have vanished from hotels since the offshoring announcement was made. She warned that many asylum seekers in the UK could go underground to avoid being offshored. 'This is a policy that trades human life for money,' she said. 'It is forcing people out of the asylum system into destitution due to fear of removal, drastically increasing the risk of exploitation.' A Home Office spokesperson said: 'This world-leading migration and economic development partnership will overhaul our broken asylum system, which is currently costing the UK taxpayer PS1.5bn a year - the highest amount in two decades. There is nothing in the UN refugee convention which prevents removal to a safe country. Under this agreement, Rwanda will process claims in accordance with national and international human rights laws.'", "ca917140963fd420e38315092461219655293523e4079ab02e54a951": "EU regulators have charged Apple with breaking competition law by limiting rivals' access to technology that is key to making contactless payments, unfairly benefiting its own Apple Pay service. The European Commission said on Monday that Apple 'sets the rules' on its closed platform and expressed concern that it has been limiting access to technology called near field communication (NFC), which rivals need for tap-and-go payments to be made in stores using mobile wallets. 'On a preliminary basis, we have found that Apple abused its dominant position,' said Margrethe Vestager, the commission's executive vice-president in charge of competition policy. 'Apple restricted access to key inputs that are necessary to develop and run mobile payments apps, so-called 'mobile wallets'. Evidence on our file indicates that some developers did not go ahead with their plans as they were not able to reach iPhone users.' The commission said the Silicon Valley company's Apple Pay service is 'by far the largest NFC-based mobile wallet on the market'. 'The preliminary conclusion we reached today relates to mobile payments in shops,' said Vestager. 'By excluding others from the game, Apple has unfairly shielded its Apple Pay wallet from competition. If proven, this behaviour would amount to abuse of a dominant position, which is illegal under our rules.' The commission has issued a statement of objections, detailing the grounds on which it believes the company 'may have illegally distorted competition in the market for mobile wallets on Apple devices', and giving the $2.5tn (PS2tn) firm an opportunity to respond. Apple could face fines worth up to 10% of its global revenues, which totalled $365bn in 2021, if the charges are upheld. 'We designed Apple Pay to provide an easy and secure way for users to digitally present their existing payment cards and for banks and other financial institutions to offer contactless payments for their customers,' said a spokesperson for the company. 'Apple Pay is only one of many options available to European consumers for making payments, and has ensured equal access to NFC while setting industry-leading standards for privacy and security. We will continue to engage with the commission to ensure European consumers have access to the payment option of their choice in a safe and secure environment.' European regulators are also investigating Apple over how it may be disadvantaging rivals by taking up to a 30% fee on purchases and subscriptions made through its App Store, which it found ultimately resulted in higher prices for consumers, following a complaint lodged by the music streaming service Spotify in 2019.", "f9bf0d783173552c59c2f7a1d5f544dfc9ebbb1d0aae890854a5b3fe": "Denmark is facing fresh claims of racism after MPs changed the country's controversial anti-ghetto law to allow Ukrainian refugees to move into social housing emptied of 'non-westerners'. For three years, the government has sought to restrict immigrants from moving into what are described as disadvantaged neighbourhoods in an attempt to avoid so-called 'parallel societies'. Access to social housing, some of which has been earmarked for demolition, has been shut off to 'non-westerners', defined as being people from outside the EU, eight associated European countries, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. People born in Denmark but who have a single 'non-western' parent have also been included in the category of people subject to the restrictions. However, after the Danish government's decision to take in 100,000 refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine, a majority of the Danish parliament voted on Thursday to amend the law to exempt Ukrainians from such restrictions. Plans to demolish social housing in the targeted areas have also been put on hold to free up accommodation for Ukrainians. Susheela Math, a litigation officer at the Justice Initiative, a campaign group against forced evictions in the so-called ghettos, said the law change proved the parallel society law was racially discriminatory. She said: 'The laws underlying the evictions of tenants living in 'vulnerable housing areas' and the state's volte-face on measures such as demolitions and housing allocations, show that the 'ghetto package' was clearly meant to target non-white individuals. 'These discriminatory measures do not serve any public good and clearly exacerbate the shortage of affordable housing in Denmark. Many of the racialised residents being evicted are Danish and identify strongly with their Danish identity, having been born in or lived in these so-called ghetto areas for years. 'These neighbourhoods are their homes. Some of these individuals were refugees themselves and have fled conflict and persecution - no differently than Ukrainians now fleeing war. The discriminatory treatment that they have been subjected to stands in stark contrast to the rightfully compassionate welcome that Ukrainian refugees have received in Denmark.' The anti-ghetto law was first proposed in March 2018 by the Liberal minority government, which introduced the political plan 'One Denmark without parallel societies - no ghettos by 2030' and enacted the concept of 'non-western' in Danish law. The Social Democratic prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, has continued the policy since coming to power in June 2019 although the word ghetto has been removed from the latest legislation. The neighbourhoods targeted have more than 1,000 residents and more than half of residents are of 'non-western' origin. They must also meet two of four criteria: more than 40% of residents are unemployed; more than 60% of 39- to 50-year-olds have no upper secondary education; crime rates are three times higher than the national average; and residents have a gross income 55% lower than the regional average. Twelve neighbourhoods currently fall into that category. In these areas, misdemeanours also carry double the legal penalties in place elsewhere and daycare is mandatory for all children over the age of one, or family allowances are withdrawn. Majken Felle, a resident of Mjolnerparken, a neighbourhood designated as a 'ghetto' area, said she was convinced the parallel societies policy was driven by bigotry. She said: 'Recently, a representative from Bo-Vita, the organization responsible for the redevelopment of Mjolnerparken, said in an interview that in neighbourhoods like mine, there is an Arab mentality and residents do not care about western culture, making these areas feel potentially unsafe to Ukrainian refugees. 'He is saying out loud what is the unspoken intention behind the permanent removal of homes in 'ghetto' areas: that these policies and demolition projects are driven by racial prejudice.' According to Statistics Denmark, 11% of Denmark's 5.8 million inhabitants are of foreign origin, of whom 58% are from a country considered 'non-western'.", "dcff8f2fb228ad3a7b240310f656141d25d075a8950b0249546bd78d": "Speaking at a rally two days ahead of voting in a heated Republican Senate primary in Ohio, Donald Trump appeared to forget the name of JD Vance, the candidate he has endorsed. 'You know,' the former president told a crowd in Greenwood, Nebraska, on Sunday, 'we've endorsed Dr Oz.' So he has, in Pennsylvania. Of Ohio, Trump said: 'We've endorsed - JP, right? JD Mandel, and he's doing great. They're all doing good. They're all doing good. And let's see what happens.'' Trump appeared to be confusing JD Vance, a former US marine, author of the bestseller Hillbilly Elegy and venture capitalist, with Josh Mandel, a rival who courted Trump for the endorsement. Trump also said: 'I think Vance is doing well, I think Oz is doing well. Does everybody like Oz? I love Oz.' Announcing his endorsement last month, Trump said: 'In the great state of Ohio, the candidate most qualified and ready to win in November is JD Vance. We cannot play games. It is all about winning!' Vance said then he was 'incredibly honored to have President Trump's support'. He did not immediately comment about Trump's slip on Sunday. Trump's endorsement - despite past remarks in which Vance called Trump 'America's Hitler' and 'a moral disaster' - boosted Vance to the top of the polls in Ohio. On Sunday, Mandel continued to hammer his opponent for such remarks, including saying in 2016 he might vote for Hillary Clinton if it seemed Trump might win. Another candidate, Mike Gibbons, told donors in an email reported by Politico: 'To be fair, you really can't blame Trump. No one knows who the real JD Vance is, as his views change faster than the weather in Ohio.' In the same rally, Trump, 75, mocked Joe Biden, 79 and the president who beat him in 2020, for stumbling over his words. Biden has often discussed his struggle to overcome a stutter. Amid widespread delight over Trump's Vance-Mandel slip, the columnist Julia Davis referred to a notorious interview in which Trump discussed passing a cognitive test which he insisted was 'difficult'. Davis wrote: 'Person. Woman. Man. Camera. TV. JP. JD. Mandel. Oh hell.' Trump's rally on Sunday was in support of Charles Herbster, a candidate for governor in Nebraska who - like Trump - faces accusations of sexual assault and misconduct.

Boudin, who lived in New York City, died of cancer on Sunday surrounded by family, including her life partner David Gilbert, who was released from prison last year for his own role in the infamous Brink's armored truck robbery. Boudin had expressed remorse for the robbery, in which a guard and two police officers were killed north of New York City. She was described as a model prisoner. She was released on parole in 2003, a move that infuriated some relatives and friends of the three men killed in the botched robbery. Boudin kept a low profile after her release and continued to work on behalf of inmates and former inmates. Her son with Gilbert, Chesa Boudin, the district attorney of San Francisco, said his mother devoted herself to others well after her cancer diagnosis in 2015. 'She, as a mother, offered not only unconditional love and pride, but also a model of how to live redemption and own responsibility for horrific mistakes without allowing them to entirely define her life,' Chesa Boudin said. Kathy Boudin was the daughter of the civil rights attorney Leonard Boudin and became a radical activist in the 1960s, joining the Weather Underground, the group that helped define the radical anti-Vietnam war movement with its violent protests and bombings. Boudin was once seen fleeing naked from a 1970 explosion of a Greenwich Village townhouse police said was used by radicals as a bomb factory. She and Gilbert joined members of the Black Liberation Army in the 20 October 1981 Brink's robbery, stealing $1.6m in cash from an armored car outside the Nanuet Mall near the Hudson River community of Nyack. A Brink's guard, Peter Paige, was killed. Two police officers, Edward O'Grady and Waverly Brown were killed when a getaway truck was stopped at a roadblock and gunmen burst from the back, weapons firing. Boudin, who was in the truck's passenger seat, was apprehended as she fled. She pleaded guilty in 1984 to murder and robbery, while maintaining that her role in the crimes was limited and that she was unarmed. 'I feel terrible about the lives that were lost as a result of this incident,' Boudin said in court. 'I have led a life committed to political principles. I believe I can be true to these principles in various ways without engaging in violent acts.' Sentenced to 20 years to life, in prison she developed a program on parenting behind bars and helped write a handbook for inmates whose children are in foster care. She earned a master's degree and worked to help inmates with Aids. After her release, she founded a program that provides healthcare for people returning from incarceration and co-founded the Center for Justice at Columbia University, which seeks alternatives to mass incarceration. She earned a doctorate from Columbia University Teachers College and taught at the Columbia School of Social Work. Gilbert, who did not plead guilty, was sentenced to 75 years to life. Last summer, the then New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, granted clemency to Gilbert just before resigning. Boudin and Gilbert were married after their arrests and divorced in prison but remained close and had been spending days together since Gilbert's release, Chesa Boudin said. The prosecutor, who ran on a progressive platform, was 14 months old when his parents were imprisoned. He was raised by Kathy Boudin and Gilbert's Weather Underground compatriots, Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn. 'I have boxes and boxes of letters that she sent me from prison,' Chesa Boudin said of his mother. 'We spent countless hours every month on the phone.'", "a524019d815cba94d8e96bdc81876d4ce5b7a46b07c42b05a74e9b8e": "Partygate could have been avoided if the police had properly investigated alleged lockdown breaches by Dominic Cummings, a former regional chief prosecutor has claimed. Nazir Afzal, the crown prosecutor for north-west England until 2015, also expressed exasperation at fresh revelations about the way Durham police looked into Cummings' journeys to Durham and Barnard Castle after they were exposed by the Guardian and the Mirror in May 2020. Last month Durham's chief constable, Jo Farrell, admitted that her officers did not interview Cummings as part of their three-day investigation into the lockdown movements of Boris Johnson's then chief adviser. She told the Mirror that the force treated Cummings's televised press conference in Downing Street's rose garden as a witness statement about his behaviour instead. In May 2021, Cummings admitted to MPs that he did not tell the whole truth in the rose garden. 'I should probably explain some things about this that were not put into the public domain at the time in the rose garden,' he told a joint session of two select committees. Speaking to the Guardian, Afzal said: 'The police relied on an account which the suspect himself has deviated from subsequently. That in itself makes it likely that the police investigation was flawed.' Afzal's lawyers, Hodge Jones & Allen, have written to the Metropolitan police and Durham constabulary urging them to share any 'lessons learned' about their handling of Cummings' behaviour in the light of the more thorough investigation that officers eventually conducted into Partygate. And they asked whether the Met still stood by its decision not to investigate Cummings leaving London for Durham when he had suspected Covid. Afzal said: 'Had the police promptly and robustly investigated those responsible for setting the rules, but seemingly breaching the rules, Partygate might not have happened. 'In relation to Dominic Cummings, then a central player within Downing Street, Durham police could and should have done so at the time of the breaches and when presented with the evidence and complaints. 'Such action would have reinforced the message to the prime minister and those around him, that the Covid regulations, which they created and encouraged others to follow, should be observed, both in spirit and by the letter.' After a three-day investigation in May 2020, Durham police concluded that Cummings' infamous journey to Barnard Castle probably amounted to a 'minor' breach of the rules. But the force took no further action and made no finding on Cummings' decision to leave London because the investigation was confined to County Durham. It also said there was insufficient evidence that Cummings made a second trip to Durham on 19 April 2020 despite taking statements from nurse practitioner Clare Edwards and her husband, Dave, claiming they had seen him in Durham that day. In February 2021 Durham police rejected a 225-page dossier submitted by Afzal's lawyers alleging that Cummings had breached the Covid rules multiple times. It also alleged that Cummings perverted the course of justice in his account of his journey to Barnard Castle on 12 April and his denial of a claim that he made a second lockdown trip to Durham around 19 April. Last May, Cummings again insisted to MPs that it was 'false' to claim he made a second trip to Durham. But he appeared to concede they did leave London a second time because of security concerns: 'It is true that I moved my family out again.' Asked at the time to explain how four people claimed to have seen him in and around Durham's Houghall Woods on the morning of 19 April, Cummings told the Guardian: 'I did not go back to Durham on [the] 19th. I was in London on [the] 19th and with my son on Hampstead Heath, and phone data proves it.' The Guardian has seen a photograph taken at 3.31pm that day appearing to show Cummings on Hampstead Heath with his family. It also established that it was possible to drive from Durham to London in under four hours during lockdown. Explaining Durham's decision not to interview Cummings, Farrell told the Mirror: 'I remember thinking, as he talked, that it would be the account of the circumstances. 'From a proportionality point of view, there was an extensive and well-documented narrative about what he had done and where he had been.

The search for the pair continued. The inmate, Casey Cole White, 38, disappeared on Friday after he left the Lauderdale county detention center in the city of Florence with Vicky White, the facility's assistant director of corrections. They have not been seen since. Vicky White told co-workers she was taking the inmate to the courthouse for a mental health evaluation. But the Lauderdale county sheriff, Rick Singleton, later said no such evaluation was scheduled. 'Casey White, as you've heard me say over and over and over, is an extremely dangerous person, and we need to get him located and get him off the street,' Singleton said at a press conference on Monday. Authorities noted his large size. He is 6ft 9in and weighs about 260lbs, according to the US Marshals Service. A US marshal, Marty Keely, said Casey White 'will stand out' even if he changes his appearance. The 38-year-old was serving a prison sentence for attempted murder and burglary, and was set to go on trial next month over the stabbing death of a 58-year-old woman, a charge in which he would face the death penalty if convicted. The US Marshals Service is offering up to $10,000 for information. Singleton said they had issued an arrest warrant for Vicky White on charges of permitting or allowing an escape. She is not related to the inmate. 'We know she participated. Whether she did that willingly or if she was coerced, threatened somehow to participate in the case ... not really sure. We know for sure she did participate,' Singleton said. The sheriff said they were shocked. 'This is not the Vicky White we know, by any stretch of the imagination,' the sheriff said. The patrol vehicle the officer and the inmate were in when they left the detention center was found at a nearby shopping center parking lot, according to the sheriff's office. Singleton said the inmate was handcuffed and shackled when he left the jail. He said video showed the pair left the jail and went straight to that parking lot. The US Marshals Service said people with information about Casey White's location or Vicky White's disappearance could call the service at 1-800-336-0102.

Earlier this month, Netflix's market value was slashed by almost $60bn as investors panicked that the decade-long streaming boom has come to an end, after the company forecast it would lose millions of subscribers in the first half of this year. Netflix invests billions of dollars annually in original content - starting with House of Cards in 2013 and extending to recent hits such as Squid Game, Ozark and Bridgerton - in a long-term strategy designed to insulate its business from the impact of Hollywood rivals pulling content they license for their own rival services. However, research shows that Netflix continues to have a significant dependency on licensed content, with major titles potentially moving off the service when contracts come up for renewal in the next few years. In the first two months of this year, 31% of the 150 most-viewed shows and films by British users belonged to Netflix's competition, and a quarter of all viewing was to content owned by rivals with streaming services of their own, according to the research firm Digital i. 'There is certainly risk for Netflix,' says Richard Broughton, an analyst at Ampere. 'A significant number of its highest-performance titles are licensed from studios with in-house streaming ambitions of their own.' Friends, the most popular show among British viewers and Netflix's biggest hit globally, has already been removed by Warner Bros Discovery in the US along with other hits such as The Big Bang Theory to drive its own HBO Max service. HBO Max is yet to launch in the UK, with Warner Bros Discovery locked in a content deal with Sky until 2025 that blocks the launch of a standalone streaming service. Sky-owner Comcast has also removed big hits such as the US version of The Office to make its Peacock streaming service more attractive in the US, but it has so far decided not to launch it as a standalone streaming rival to Netflix in the UK. 'The nation's favourite American sitcoms are safe - for now,' says Ali Vahdati, chief executive of Digital i. 'In the long term, Netflix will need to extricate itself from such a strong reliance on US major Hollywood studio content, or else risk high levels of churn when others launch fully in the market.' This summer, Paramount is launching Paramount+ in the UK and has almost completely removed the Star Trek franchise from Netflix, which Digital i estimates to be worth over PS50m to Netflix across Europe. Popular Paramount-owned content that is still on Netflix but likely to move when deals expire include the Sonic the Hedgehog film, the SpongeBob Movie, The Wolf of Wall Street and films The Gentleman and Mother/Android. However, Netflix's originals strategy continues to be hugely successful with shows such as Stay Close, Ozark, Inventing Anna, Cobra Kai and films including Power of the Dog, Don't Look Up and Red Notice all major hits with subscribers globally. 'We know that having fresh, new content is what helps drive new sign-ups, and this is where Netflix has much more security in its offer,' says Broughton. 'Of the titles which were first released in 2021 and 2022, Netflix Originals dominate. Just 10% of the most popular shows and movies that were released since the start of 2021 were not Netflix Originals (or Exclusives). So while there is inevitably a risk if popular titles driving consumption are lost, Netflix does have a huge range of alternative options for subscribers.' Netflix hitting a subscriber wall has sent shock waves through the industry and is likely to lead to rivals reassessing how attractive, and profitable, the streaming model can be. The decision by players such as Disney+ to cut all content licensing deals to provide TV series and films exclusively to subscribers to its own service only works if Disney+ can be built to a massive scale. Netflix, which plans to focus on a 'less is more' strategy of fewer but higher-quality commissions of series and films, is estimated to be spending $17bn making and licensing content this year. The cuts, which are likely to include job losses, are already being felt with Netflix reportedly axing an animated family TV series from the production company set up by Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and Prince Harry. Rival Disney, which owns assets including Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ and the ABC TV network, is spending $33bn in 2022. Warner Bros Discovery is expected to spend $20bn. 'The recent streaming slowdown is prompting a number of investors and executives to revisit prior assumptions about how large the siloed direct-to-consumer model can become,' says Broughton. 'So it is not at all clear that Netflix will lose access to all major studio content in the future. I suspect a number of the majors won't take the same purist angle adopted by Disney, and instead will take a more mercenary approach, windowing titles and licensing content to third parties where they can achieve solid rights fees.'

The uninvited guest surprised Naples homeowners Karyn and Jamie Dobson when they opened the connecting door from their house after hearing a crash, WINK News reported. 'I open the door about a quarter way, peek my head in, and there's the alligator,' Jamie Dobson said. He said the 8ft crocodilian was backing away, with froth from the cans all over the floor. The couple had purchased several slabs of sodas for Karyn Dobson's party a few days later. 'There was Diet Coke spewing everywhere because the gator tore open the box [and] had a few cans, probably thought it was beer maybe,' she said. 'We were all standing there like a scaredy cat. People have sent me texts and emails ... they have all these comments [like] 'What a great birthday present.'' The alligator is believed to have sneaked in after the couple returned from walking their dog and neglected to close the garage door. The Dobsons said they had recently moved to the area from Chicago and were not aware of the danger of leaving the garage door open. '[It's] something [that being] from the midwest I really haven't experienced before,' Jamie Dobson said. A trapper caught the alligator and relocated it to a non-residential area. Alligator encounters in built-up communities are more frequent during mating season, which began in April and lasts until June as the reptiles emerge from the swamps and go looking for a partner. Wildlife officials say they rarely pose a direct threat to humans. 'Alligators seldom bite people for reasons other than food,' the Florida fish and wildlife commission says in its human-alligator incidents fact sheet, which notes the state has a 'healthy' population of about 1.3 million of the reptiles. 'Female alligators may protect their nests by hissing and opening their mouths to frighten intruders but rarely bite people. Alligator bites are most likely to occur in or around water.'", "8a17f0a35708c91aba7ddf5bc55dde0c3c2287793165be71b017f44f": "", "02569695e84dd701677bae6a2b2374885c01ac31fb47ac43447584bf": "", "a3dafa16b4724d49e4fcecaaeaef662388145d49e9b704822427440a": "A dog came bounding over as Oleh Bondarenko walked towards the garden containing the burned-out house where he had been beaten, tortured and left to die. 'Hey, friend,' he shouted, stroking her head and explaining the affectionate greeting. 'I talked to her a lot when I was here'. He lost several teeth to Russian assaults, his torso is covered with scars, and the damage to his spine may be permanent. But his sense of humour has somehow emerged unscathed from a days-long ordeal at the hands of Russian soldiers who served in Syria before bringing some of the horrors of that war to the once-bucolic countryside outside Kyiv. 'My small house,' he said with an ironic smile, peering down into a concrete pipe sunk into the ground to serve as a water cistern. It is not deep enough to stand in when the manhole cover is on and not wide enough to sit down; it is just about large enough to hold a man hunched over in a kind of slouch. Bondarenko was kept here for two days in March, slowly losing all feeling in his arms and legs, and then all ability to move them. Russian forces had arrived in Motyzhyn, just south of the main highway that leads west out of Kyiv, five days into the war. In a small wood on its outskirts they hid a battery of Grad rocket launchers and other artillery, excavated dugouts for dozens of troops, then set up camp to torture and murder civilians in the compound beside their position. By the time Bondarenko was brought there - blindfolded on top of a truck after beatings, mock executions and other torture at his home and then an abandoned farm - the soldiers had set up a grim routine, which they worked through each day in a drunken bloodlust. 'It was systematic,' he said. The grass next to the large porch of a storehouse was used for torture by officers who rested and ate under the canopy. The ruins of the bombed-out house was where executions took place, and in the nearby woods they dug shallow mass graves for victims. This nightmare was presided over by three men who had been shaped in a conflict notorious for abuses. Trapped in his underground chamber, Bondarenko heard them gloat about their transfer to Ukraine. 'They said that, after Syria, it was like a fairytale for them here,' he said. 'It is a wealthy village, and there was plenty for them to steal.' It has been clear since the invasion began that troops and officers fighting there included many who had been in Syria. But Bondarenko's testimony now links some of the worst abuses of this war to men who were on the ground thousands of miles away, defending the regime of Bashar al-Assad. Prosecutors for the Kyiv region, who have had to turn abruptly from investigating small-town crime to documenting extensive atrocities, are investigating the village killing camp. Oleh Tkalenko, a senior prosecutor for the Kyiv region, told the Observer: 'We are aware of these commanders. We are close to identifying them and their names will soon be released.' He also said authorities were aware that a number of Russian soldiers who came into the Kyiv region had previously operated in Syria. Bondarenko said intelligence services had already told him the first name of one of his main tormentors. In Motyzhyn, unlike in Syria, the soldiers could speak the same language as their victims, yet it made no difference. They used that connection simply to interrogate and torment without needing an interpreter. 'This is Russkiy Mir - the Russian world,' said Bondarenko with bitter irony, as he surveyed the killing field in his village, referring to the concept Vladimir Putin has invoked to justify his invasion, which denies Ukraine's nationhood and claims it as just a region of greater Russia. Bondarenko had been dragged into a local centre of operation for Moscow's murderous war simply because of where he lived - one of the twists of bad luck that has put so many thousands of Ukrainian civilians into the path of abusive soldiers and their guns. The head of the territorial army for the village, perhaps wiser than he was brave, had fled with his family at the start of the invasion. But he owned a yard next to a rehabilitation centre for drug users where Bondarenko is a live-in manager. The Russians were jumpy and angry after a Ukrainian ambush took out a convoy of ammunition heading through the centre of the village. 'The next day the Russians came round with two tanks, killed people and shot up cars and garages,' said Serhii Dovichenko, who works at the village shop, which was looted and burned. They also destroyed several homes by the site of the attack. On 23 March, convinced that the Ukrainian resistance was operating nearby, they burst into Bondarenko's centre, shooting the walls, mirrors and windows. They beat him, carried out a mock execution and then tied him to a quad bike and forced him to run as it drove off, telling him that if he fell he would be shot. He managed to stay upright until they reached a nearby farmyard, where they beat him again and faked another execution. Then, because he could not tell them the location of an army unit he was not part of, they loaded him blindfolded on to a truck and took him to their camp. Soon after he arrived, Ukrainian forces started shelling, and his captors fled to the basement, leaving him tied up outside. 'They told us, 'let your own kill you',' Bondarenko said, and a piece of shrapnel skimmed his stomach, causing bleeding and a scar. At the time he had no idea where he was, although the camp was barely two miles from his home. He realised what was going on there, however, when the soldiers told him they had just killed the much-loved head of the village council, together with her husband and son. Known to locals as Olga Petrivna, a name that mixed affection and deference, she had chosen to stay and coordinate aid and territorial defence when the Russians arrived. For that, her family all paid with their lives; a large billboard with a photo of them now marks the entrance to the village from the motorway, with a message: 'Eternal respect from the people of Motyzhyn.' They were subjected to the same sadistic ritual as most victims of the camp, locals said. They were badly beaten, their arms twisted and broken, then, as death approached, they were shot in the hands or knees to cause maximum pain, then shot again in the stomach before finally being killed by a bullet to the back of the head. Bondarenko said of one later murder he heard while underground: 'I could hear them killing him for an hour and a half, and I prayed they would take him quicker.' There were perhaps 60 soldiers at the Motyzhyn site, scattered in dugouts with officers in a house across a small lake. Not all were Syria veterans: there were also regular recruits - so fresh from Russia they didn't realise for two weeks they were in Ukraine - who had to cook for the commanders and carry water, and who were apparently horrified by what they saw. In a bid, perhaps, to salvage their own humanity, they rescued Bondarenko, 48 hours into his ordeal. While the torturers were drunk, the recruits dragged him out and carried him to a room used as a prison at the back of the house. They warned him to stay quiet and cover his face, because the commanders would assume he had joined others in the mass grave if they noticed he was missing at all, but if they found him they would certainly kill him. Two days later, the same recruits unlocked the door, said the Russians were leaving and warned the two men inside not to come out for two hours because of the risk from lingering snipers. 'They asked me to pray for them,' Bondarenko said. 'These guys didn't want any of this; they were in shock themselves, and to this day I pray for them. They saved my life.' The men had also dug an individual deep grave to bury a woman killed by a sniper after her father - who had been held with Bondarenko simply because he had come to the base to ask for medical help - begged them not to throw her into the mass pit. The Russians burned the forest and fields to deprive Ukrainian forces of camouflage. Now spring is returning, green shoots are emerging through the charred ground and daffodils are in bloom just a few metres from the torture chamber. Not far from the graves, a book lies open beside a dugout. Tales and Fairy Tales looks as if it had been abandoned mid-chapter by a young soldier in a rush to leave, who hadn't realised, or didn't want to know, that metres away a real-life horror had unfolded, and that he had been part of it.

Scholz has faced fierce criticism even from within his own government and last week came under particular fire from the opposition leader, Friedrich Merz, who accused him of weak leadership and of 'procrastination, dithering and timidity'. On Sunday it was reported that Merz was planning to travel to Kyiv on Monday. Scholz appeared to bow to immense domestic and international pressure last week by announcing that Germany would deliver heavy weaponry to Ukraine, in the form of self-propelled anti-aircraft systems, in what was seen as a sharp policy U-turn. But while the outspoken Ukrainian ambassador to Berlin, Andriy Melnyk, said he welcomed the move, he piled further pressure on Scholz on Sunday by insisting it did not go nearly far enough, and demanding more 'fantasy and courage' from Germany. Responding to the criticism in an interview with the tabloid Bild am Sonntag, Scholz said: 'I am making my decisions quickly and in conjunction with our allies.' He said that 'overhasty actions and Germany going it alone' would be viewed with suspicion. Scholz said: 'I am not fearful enough to allow myself to be affected by such accusations.' He insisted he would not be cowed into changing his strategy by his record-low popularity rating. 'You should notice opinion polls but you should not make your actions dependent on them. Especially regarding questions of war and peace, this would be immensely dangerous,' he said. According to the polling institute Insa, 54% of Germans are unhappy with Scholz's record. Scholz, who has been in office for just under five months, found himself plunged early on into dealing with the dilemma faced by almost every government leader since the second world war - having to tread a thin line between Germany assuming international responsibilities and avoiding accusations both at home and abroad that its actions might drag Europe into another war. Melnyk, who has himself drawn criticism within Germany for his persistent complaints about what he has repeatedly described as the country's lack of decisive action, said that the Gepard anti-aircraft guns promised last week were insufficient and too old. 'The direction is the right one, but of course they are not enough. In particular we're lacking ammunition for the Gepards ... and in addition they are 40 years old. In order to defeat Russia we need the most modern Germany weaponry,' he said, also speaking to Bild. He said his criticism was directed at 'the entire German political class', accusing Germany of being 'very wrapped up in itself' and urging it to 'at last become aware of its enormous historical responsibility'.  Melnyk listed the specific arms he said Ukraine needed Germany to deliver. 'We want the speedy export of 88 Leopard tanks, 100 Marder armoured personnel carriers, self-propelled howitzers and much more. We are experiencing the biggest war in Europe for 80 years. It cannot be won with 30 or 100 more anti-aircraft systems.'  Melnyk acknowledged that Germany had taken in a large number of refugees from Ukraine, including his own mother-in-law. Officially the figure is just under 400,000, according to German border police, although the real number is believed to be much higher as they are not required to register and can be in Germany without a visa for 90 days. 'I am grateful to Germany for every help it gives. But we're talking about life and death in Ukraine, and the survival of my nation,' he said. As debate raged among policymakers in Germany as to when and whether Germany can become independent from Russian gas supplies, the news agency DPA reported that the government was planning to support EU plans for a Russian oil embargo, as part of a sixth round of sanctions about to be announced by the bloc, despite opposition from Hungary, Austria, Slovakia, Spain, Italy and Greece.  Germany has already reduced its dependence on Russian gas from 55% to 35% since the start of the war, but full independence is not expected to be reached until 2024, Robert Habeck, the economics minister, has said.", "333173a2ff73a02fa30556004e6495a2d67a6b6f61c6425de57f02fc": "Russia's online trolling operation is becoming increasingly decentralised and is gaining 'incredible traction' on TikTok with misinformation aimed at sowing doubt over events in Ukraine, a US social media researcher has warned. Darren Linvill, professor at Clemson University, South Carolina, who has been studying the Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency (IRA) troll farm operation since 2017, said it was succeeding in creating more authentic-seeming posts. He has identified the sharing of faked factchecking posts and accounts which amplify disinformation by linking between platforms such as Instagram, TikTok and Telegram as current tactics by the IRA, which is now believed to be operating across different locations. On Sunday, the UK government claimed it has identified a former factory in St Petersburg as a new base for trolling operations where 'cyber soldiers are ruthlessly targeting politicians and audiences across a number of countries including the UK, South Africa and India'. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office cited government-funded research, which it has not published, that reportedly shows paid staff in Russia are 'using Telegram to actively recruit and coordinate new supporters who then target the social media profiles of Kremlin critics - spamming them with pro-Putin and pro-war comments'. Linvill said this was 'highly consistent with what we have seen the IRA previously do, given how it understands the power of authenticity'. It was reported that targets have included Boris Johnson's social media accounts as well as accounts of bands and musicians including Daft Punk, David Guetta and Tiesto. The government said it had shared the research with the social media platforms. It said the Russian operation was searching for 'organic content' posted by genuine users consistent with its messaging, and then working to amplify these messages. 'This means that, provided the content they post is not too offensive, they are unlikely to be subject to de-platforming interventions,' an official said. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, said: 'We cannot allow the Kremlin and its shady troll farms to invade our online spaces with their lies about Putin's illegal war. The UK government has alerted international partners and will continue to work closely with allies and media platforms to undermine Russian information operations.' Linvill said trolls using comments under legitimate accounts was a common disinformation tactic and was not new, adding: 'The IRA has a long history of taking advantage of legitimate voices.' One benefit of a troll posting comments under an account with large numbers of followers is that they do not need many followers themselves to be seen. He said the IRA almost always posted in Russian and the main goal appeared to be influencing Russian public opinion, but the UK government said its latest research suggested Moscow's operation was 'designed to manipulate international public opinion' in favour of its military campaign in Ukraine. TikTok and Twitter have closed scores of accounts in recent months which Linvill believes may be linked to the IRA. He said the impact of TikTok was particularly startling, with some accounts having hundreds of thousands of followers. 'They were very, very effective,' he said. 'They got an incredible amount of traction in the nationalist Russian space.' Twitter said it proactively assesses for inauthentic behaviour and since the start of the war in Ukraine it has removed over 100,000 accounts for violations of its platform manipulation and spam policy. It has labelled or removed 50,000 pieces of content. TikTok and Meta, which operates Facebook and Instagram, have also been approached for comment. Linvill said the IRA's strategy was not to cause people to believe something new, but rather to sow doubt and cause distrust in information sources that are usually seen as legitimate, in particular to deter domestic opposition to the Russian president. 'If you don't believe in anything, you're not going to fight for anything and you are more likely to go along with Putin,' he said.", "e3717c9b8eb8df5b50e7d1765b9fcf6a7663a5b18f01d4b31795bdec": "The House committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol will decide 'in the next week or two' whether to issue subpoenas trying to force Republican lawmakers to testify about Donald Trump's attempt to overturn the 2020 election, one of two Republicans on the panel said on Sunday. 'If that takes a subpoena, it takes a subpoena,' Adam Kinzinger said. The Illinois congressman also told CBS's Face the Nation public hearings planned for June will aim to 'lay the whole story out in front of the American people ... because ultimately, they have to be the judge' of Trump's attempt to hold on to power. Kinzinger and nine other House Republicans voted to impeach Trump over the Capitol attack, which a bipartisan Senate committee linked to seven deaths. But Senate Republicans stayed loyal, acquitting Trump, and Kinzinger is one of four anti-Trump House Republicans who have since announced their retirements. He and Liz Cheney of Wyoming are the only Republicans on the January 6 committee. The June hearings, Kinzinger said, will involve laying out 'what led to January 6, the lies after the election, fundraising, the 187 minutes the president basically sat in the Oval Office [as the Capitol was attacked] ... the response by [the Department of Defense]. 'It's important for us to be able to put that in front of the American people because ultimately, they have to be the judge. The Department of Justice will make decisions based on information but the American people ... have to take the work we've done and decide what they want to do with it or what they want to believe.' Majorities of Republicans in Congress and in public polls believe - or choose to support and repeat - Trump's lie that Biden stole the presidency via electoral fraud. Prominent Trump supporters in Congress who have advanced that lie and were involved in attempts to overturn the election before 6 January have refused to speak to the House committee. 'I won't say who I think we need to talk to yet,' Kinzinger said. 'I mean, I think everybody needs to come and talk to us. We've requested information from various members. 'In terms of whether we move forward with a subpoena, it's going to be both a strategic tactical decision and the question of whether or not we can do that and get the information in time. Decisions we make every day.' Kinzinger added, 'I think ultimately, whatever we can do to get that information. I think if that takes a subpoena, it takes a subpoena. 'But I think the key is, regardless of even what some members of Congress are going to tell us, we know a lot of information ... we're going deeper with richer and more detail to show the American people.' Kinzinger said he would 'love to see' Mike Pence, Trump's vice-president who ultimately refused to reject electoral college results on 6 January, testify before the committee. 'I hope he would do so voluntarily,' he said. 'These are decisions I think that we're going to end up making from a tactical perspective in the next week or two, because we basically pinned down what this hearing schedule is going to look like, the content. 'And as we go into the full narrative of this thing. I would hope and think that the vice-president would want to come in and tell this story, because he did do the right thing on that day. If he doesn't, we have to look at the options we have available to us if there's information we don't already have.' A lawyer for Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a far-right Republican congresswoman shown in court filings by the committee to have been in contact with the White House around 6 January, has claimed she was in fact a victim of the riot. 'I'd love to ask her a few questions,' Kinzinger said. 'We know some things. I won't confirm or deny the text messages of course, but let me just say this. 'For Marjorie Taylor Greene to say she's a victim, it's amazing ... I mean, she assaulted I think a survivor ... from a school shooting at some point in DC. She stood outside a congresswoman's office and yelled through a mail slot and said [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] was too scared to come out and confront her. 'And then when Marjorie Taylor Greene is confronted she's all of a sudden a victim and a poor helpless congresswoman that's just trying to do a job? That's insane. 'We want the information.'", "82874db0ee523638a011388e0bdda97ce4b5c6d802e58f5a9e88c864": "A feminist march on the eve of May Day, known as Walpurgnisnacht, when witches traditionally meet, kicked off May Day demonstrations in Berlin, with a group of around 2,500 'Take back the night'. The demonstration, described as lively and initially peaceful, was aimed at reconquering the night for women, lesbians, intersex and transgender people, according to the organisers. Accompanied by a large police presence, it concentrated on the northern and central Prenzlauerberg and Mitte districts of Berlin. But police intervened to stop the march after some participants set fire to coloured flares and bottles were thrown. Later in the evening, protesters apparently acting independently of organisers threw paint at shop windows and several panes of glass were broken, leading to three arrests. Charges were brought for breaching the peace, violent assault, bodily harm and criminal damage, police spokesperson Anja Dierschke told broadcaster rbb24. Walpurgisnacht is an event in German folklore when witches meet to hold revels with the devil, traditionally in the region of north central Germany on the Brocken mountain. Tens of thousands of others took to the streets elsewhere across the country too, drawing attention to a wide range of issues dominated by the war in Ukraine, the rising cost of living, workers' rights, rental controls and plans to invest heavily in the German military. A separate demonstration around an election campaign event in the northern state of Schleswig Holstein saw foreign minister Annalena Baerbock face accusations of warmongering for her support of providing arms to Ukraine. A later event in the day in which she was due to participate had to be called off after protesters sprayed the stage with butyric acid. Chancellor Olaf Scholz, speaking to a May Day rally in Dusseldorf, said he respected the values of pacifists but defended his decision to send arms to Ukraine, and said that equipment and aid would keep on coming to the country. He said with a looming food crisis expected to hit Africa in particular, because of wheat and other basic food supplies unable to be shipped from Ukraine, he pledged Germany's support to help countries in need. 'I respect all pacifism, I respect all values,' said Scholz. 'But it would be cynical to tell a citizen of Ukraine he must defend himself against Putin's aggression if he has no weapons.'. Frank Werneke, leader of Europe's largest trade union, Verdi, speaking at a rally in Mainz, warned against a new arms race following Scholz's recent announcement that he would provide EUR100bn (PS84bn) to update Germany's military. Werneke said the injection of such large amounts of money also from the United States and elsewhere, was in danger of disadvantaging poorer sections of society in particular. 'What we don't want is a new arms race that comes at the expense of badly needed investments in social welfare, education and climate protection,' he said. In Dortmund police intervened to break up protests involving leftwing demonstrators. But a spokesperson for the anti-fascist group Autonome Antifa 170 accused police of violence and said several of its members had been injured. The group had gathered to prevent a march of more than 200 rightwing extremists. In Berlin the far-left Linke party called on the government to introduce a new law ensuring that if federal holidays, such as this year's May Day, fall on a weekend, workers are given a weekday off to compensate.", "611e7cf54f927130d5ba1c7e1fba9aa2345a28c4e3b160dc9cf6365e": "Qantas has unveiled details of the ultra-long-haul aircraft it plans to run on non-stop flights from Sydney and Melbourne to London and New York by the end of 2025, as questions are raised about the emissions benefits and spending priorities of the airline. Confirming reports that have swirled in recent days, Qantas announced its mega order with European plane manufacturer Airbus for 12 of its A350-1000 aircraft. These will be run on the so-called 'Project Sunrise' flights, with the first to be delivered in 2025. The airline says the planes will be 'capable of flying direct from Australia to any other city' in the world, while being 25% more fuel-efficient than previous aircraft. The wide-body planes will be able to carry 238 passengers - about 100 fewer seats than competitors flying the A350 - and will feature 'wellbeing zones' for passengers to move about in the cabin as a way to break up the ultra-long-haul flights that will reach up to 20 hours. Chief executive Alan Joyce said Project Sunrise is 'the last frontier and the final fix for the tyranny of distance' and that the cabin of the A350s 'is being specially designed for maximum comfort in all classes for long-haul flying'. The airline has planned the project for years, with the pandemic delaying its launch. The projected 20 hour Sydney to London service would become the longest commercial flight in the world. Despite Qantas' claim that the non-stop flights and new aircraft will bring 'major improvements in emissions', experts say the benefits will be negligible. Currently, an average return trip from Sydney to London with a stop in Singapore generates about 3500kg of CO2 emissions per passenger, according to estimates based on Atmosfair data. Dr Tony Webber, a former chief economist at Qantas who now leads the Airline Intelligence Research group and works at the University of New South Wales' aviation school, said that ultra long haul flights 'are normally not very fuel-efficient at all'. 'It's true that reducing four movements - a take off and landing for each leg - means less fuel is burned, but for a plane to stay in the air for 20 hours without refuelling means they are carrying an enormous amount of fuel. 'That extra fuel is extra weight, which in turn means you've got to burn more fuel overall to carry it. It's a real inefficiency compared with flights that can carry less and refuel at a stop over,' Webber said. Webber said that the need to carry so much fuel would create payload restrictions, meaning the aircraft could tolerate less freight and passengers. Conversely, these weight restrictions could lead Qantas to opt for a more spacious seat configuration in its A350s, Webber said, as it can't maximise the number of seats in line with available cabin space. Qantas has already said more than 40% of the cabin on its A350s will be 'dedicated to premium seating', in addition to its 'wellbeing zones'. 'Being confined to a small space, especially an economy seat, for 18 hours or more is torture,' said Webber. 'Personal space will have to be increased, as well as space for pilots and crew to rest.' While Qantas has not yet released costs for the ultra long haul flights, Webber predicted that at the very minimum, non-stop routes would be $300 more expensive per leg, and increase in line with how much time the route saves the passenger. Professor Bruce Thompson, head of Melbourne University's School of Health Sciences, cautioned that the negative effects of repeated long haul flying on pilot and crew members' circadian rhythms would be more pronounced on the longer flights. In addition to deep vein thrombosis risk for those in tight economy seats, Thompson said there could be mental health implications that become more pronounced in the final few hours of the 20 hour long services. 'The airlines need to consider comfort and safety onboard these flights. They'll need multiple sets of crews just to staff them, and you need pilots alert especially at landing,' he said. Ultimately, Thompson said not enough research had been done to definitively know the safety of flying non-stop for 20 hours. Previous studies commissioned by Qantas on the passenger experience of long haul flying drew suggestions for exercise bikes and virtual reality technology onboard. Transport Workers Union national secretary Michael Kaine was critical of Qantas' spending on new aircraft after thousands of employees lost their jobs during the pandemic. Qantas received about $2bn in government Covid wage supports, and separately, the airline was found to have illegally outsourced 2,000 ground handling jobs. 'While many illegally outsourced workers are still struggling to make ends meet and passengers are suffering long delays and lost luggage, we see Qantas splashing the cash on new planes and flight routes,' Kaine said. Qantas has also ordered an additional 40 Airbus aircraft - A321XLRs and A220-300s - for domestic operations, with the first of these aircraft to be delivered next year. The deal is understood to be valued in the billions of dollars. While the airline says the exact cost of the new planes is commercial-in-confidence, it said 'a significant discount from the standard price should be assumed'. Analysts at Barrenjoey estimated in a client note the entire order could cost at least $6 billion, Reuters reported. On the orders to refresh its domestic fleet, Joyce said the range and economics of the new planes Qantas had ordered 'will make new direct routes possible, including serving regional cities better' and that 'these newer aircraft and engines will reduce emissions by at least 15% if running on fossil fuels, and significantly better when run on sustainable aviation fuel'. Meanwhile, Qantas Group - which includes budget carrier Jetstar - also released its third quarter financial update on Monday. While the resurgence of domestic and some international travel markets has boosted revenue, the airline still expects to post 'a significant' full-year loss. Net debt has reduced from $5.5bn at the end of December to $4.5bn by the end of April. In 2017, Qantas launched non-stop service from Perth to London, and now flies the from Darwin to London.", "d6326195597bf185382a401cc3435941d8631f5604efc8d38e6710d8": "Maori songs, tearful embraces and a beloved New Zealand chocolate bar awaited international visitors arriving in New Zealand on Monday - the first foreign guests, other than Australians, to set foot in Aotearoa in more than two years. Since March 2020, the arrival terminals at New Zealand's international airports have been desolate as the country swiftly closed the border to prevent the arrival of Covid-19.  On Monday morning, the border reopened to vaccinated visitors from about 60 visa-waiver countries as part of the government's phased reopening plan. The first travellers and returning New Zealanders touched down just after 6am at Auckland international airport from Los Angeles, with another flight from San Francisco arriving shortly after. Garth and Chris Halliday cried as their son Stephen arrived with his wife and son, who they hadn't seen in over a year, the news website Stuff reported. Garth said the tearful airport scenes were reminiscent of those in the film Love Actually, while Stephen said it was 'emotional' to be home. An American tourist told RNZ through tears they had wanted to visit New Zealand for many years. 'I'm finally here. It's amazing,' they said. Vaccinated international visitors can enter New Zealand if they have had a negative pre-departure Covid test. On arrival, they must self-test for coronavirus, and unless it comes back positive there is no requirement quarantine or self-isolate. All other international visitors will be allowed to enter New Zealand from October, unless the government decides it is safe to do so earlier. The tourism minister, Stuart Nash, who greeted arrivals at the gate with a Whittaker's Peanut Slab chocolate bar, told 1News the reunions 'almost bring a tear to the eye'. 'People haven't seen each other for a long, long time - family and friends,' he said. 'We have also, of course, got international business people [who] are able to reconnect and they are coming back.' Nash said that while the country is not yet quite back to normal, the reopening was another step towards it. 'This has been a long time [coming] - this sends a signal we are now open for business ... it is fantastic to see,' Nash said. 'Today marks a milestone for visitors from our key northern hemisphere markets in the USA, UK, Germany, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Canada and others, who can now jump on a plane to come here.' More than 30,000 people are arriving into the country each week - an increase on numbers throughout the pandemic, but well below pre-Covid levels, which were close to 25,000 people each day. Nash said international flight searches to New Zealand were running 19% higher than in pre-Covid times. Auckland airport's chief executive Carrie Hurihanganui said 9,000 passengers would be arriving and departing on 43 international flights on Monday - three times the number in March. The airport has boosted its staff by 40 people, and will continue to do so in the coming months, she said. Hurihanganui said the reunions were giving her 'goosebump moments'. 'It's been a pleasure to be here today, and the fact we can play a role in welcoming people back to Aotearoa is fantastic,' she told 1News outside the arrivals gate.", "8933c7b09d660891384e670eda3a5907ea142eaf8250925721fcd3fd": "The Arkansas governor, Asa Hutchinson, is considering a run for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024 and would not be deterred if Donald Trump made an expected bid to return to the White House. 'No, it won't [deter me],' Hutchinson told CNN's State of the Union on Sunday. 'I've made it clear. I think we ought to have a different direction in the future and so I'm not aligned with [Trump] on some of his endorsements, but also the direction he wants to take our country. 'I think he did a lot of good things for our country, but we need to go a different direction and so that's not a factor in my decision-making process.' Trump is free to run - and has amassed huge campaign funding - after being acquitted in his second Senate impeachment trial, in which he was charged with inciting the deadly January 6 Capitol attack, in his attempt to overturn defeat by Joe Biden. More than 20 years ago, Hutchinson was a House impeachment manager in the trial of Bill Clinton, over the 42nd president's affair with Monica Lewinsky. As Arkansas governor, Hutchinson now operates in the more moderate lane of Republican politics. On CNN, he was asked about an appearance last week at a 'Politics & Eggs' event in New Hampshire, a 'traditional stop for any presidential hopeful' in an early voting state. 'You've got to get through course this year,' he said, 'but that's an option that's on the table. And that's one of the reasons I was in New Hampshire.' Hutchinson used his CNN interview to take a shot at Ron DeSantis, another potential candidate in 2024, regarding the Florida governor's battle with Disney over his anti-LGBTQ+ schools policy.  The Arkansas governor was also asked if he would support Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader and an ardent Trump ally, to become speaker if Republicans take control in November. He said: 'Well, of course, you know, Speaker McCarthy, or excuse me, Majority Leader McCarthy has his own set of challenges within the caucus. And he's got to be able to somehow bring that together.' McCarthy was recently shown to have said Trump should resign in the aftermath of the Capitol attack, to have changed his tune to support the former president, and to have lied about what he told his party. Hutchinson told CNN: 'I would say that we had one message after January 6 among many of our leaders, recognising the problem with the insurrection. And that tone has changed and I believe that that's an error. 'I don't think we can diminish what happened on January 6. We're going to be having hearings there in Congress and much of this will come out in public in June, and that's not going to be helpful for those that diminish the significance of that event. 'And so that worries me in terms of not just the majority leader but also worries me in terms of other leaders that have diminished what happened on January 6.'", "d83ad0e64b71727f363074795c9cdc46ca4cb13111de690757677c1c": "Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, has fallen victim to cutbacks at Netflix, according to a US report that said the struggling streaming giant has dropped plans for her animated series Pearl. Announced to fanfare last summer, with Meghan as its creator and executive producer, the 'family series' was to have focused on the adventures of a 12-year-old girl inspired by historically influential female figures. It was to have been the first animated production under Meghan and her husband Prince Harry's Archewell brand, which was created in 2020 as a vehicle for their new careers in the US, following their separation from the British royal family. Netflix, once dominant among streaming platforms but now wrestling with slumping subscriber numbers and a collapse in share value, dropped the project amid a wave of cutbacks, according to Deadline. Referring to the decision unflatteringly as 'a royal flush', the entertainment industry website said the project Meghan was co-executive-producing with David Furnish, who is married to Elton John, was axed in the development stage. 'Word in town is that even before recent events, Netflix had been telling producers to take some development projects elsewhere,' the report said. 'Clearly, Netflix's inordinately high content spend is being re-evaluated. It is just unreasonable to expect its execs to manage that many projects, and have enough of them turn out to be memorable.' Netflix did not immediately comment. There was also no immediate reaction from Archewell, leaving it unclear if the company would continue production on Pearl or attempt to move it elsewhere. Other Archewell projects with Netflix, including the documentary series Heart of Invictus, about Harry's Olympics-style Invictus Games for disabled former service members, are believed to be unaffected. The former working royals, who live in Montecito, California, signed a multi-year deal with Netflix in September last year. Netflix has dropped two animated series not produced by Archewell, Dino Daycare and Boons and Curses, according to the Hollywood Reporter. In publicity material for the announcement of Pearl last summer, Meghan said she was excited. 'Like many girls her age, our heroine Pearl is on a journey of self-discovery as she tries to overcome life's daily challenges,' she said. 'I'm thrilled that Archewell Productions, partnered with the powerhouse platform of Netflix and these incredible producers, will together bring you this new animated series, which celebrates extraordinary women throughout history. 'David Furnish and I have been eager to bring this special series to light.'", "d7da42ed6d24663b062ded1951d5553d2eeb1343b1417ecc3c883630": "", "f43da7ec1007722b15d937382dc3fff0b31e6c11359d5426baadce20": "Untreated sewage was discharged into England's coastal bathing waters for more than 160,000 hours last year, according to figures collated by the Liberal Democrats to mark the start of the summer sea-swimming season. Data compiled by the party using Environment Agency figures on 2021 discharges shows that water companies released raw sewage 25,000 times into designated bathing waters off the English coast. Figures collated by the campaign group Top of the Poops reveal that when also including the bathing waters in Wales, water companies released untreated sewage for 217,804 hours. The bathing water designations - which were created by the EU - are supposed to highlight the country's cleanest and safest waters for the public. The quality of the water is publicly identified on signs at the bathing beaches, ranging from excellent to poor. The longest discharges into bathing waters were carried out by United Utilities, which released untreated sewage into sea-swimming spots in its area for almost 75,000 hours. The company's worst-hit bathing water site was Morecambe South beach. A United Utilities spokesperson told the Guardian that the area has seen billions of pounds of water company investment over the last 30 years meaning that bathing waters are now cleaner than they have ever been. 'Across the region, 93% of bathing waters were classified as Good or Excellent in 2021 and all met the designated minimum standards.  'We are already committed to a programme of action for further improvements, building on this environmental achievement, and we are spending PS230m over the next three years to reduce the impact of storm overflows.'  Southern Water, which was last year fined a record PS90m for spilling billions of litres of raw sewage into Hampshire and Kent coastal waters, was responsible for 20,367 hours of untreated sewage discharges into designated bathing spots off the coast in their area. South West Water discharged sewage into bathing beauty spots for 43,901 hours, with their longest discharge released at Ilfracombe's Wildersmouth Beach, lasting 1,833 hours. The figures were released as the official sea-swimming season opened on Sunday. This marks the start of annual monitoring of bathing-water quality, which helps to inform the public about the water at beaches they visit. The season lasts until September. Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrats rural affairs spokesperson, said: 'It is now or never to save families from swimming in sewage-infested waters this summer. 'Children should be free to enjoy Britain's great coastlines and lakes, yet Conservative ministers are letting water companies get away with shameful sewage dumps. This is an environmental scandal.' The data was released as many parts of the UK prepare to go to the polls on Thursday to vote in local elections. The Liberal Democrats have called for a sewage tax on water companies' profits to be used to clean up coastlines, rivers and lakes. Environment Agency data shows that in 2021 water companies released raw sewage into all coastal waters and rivers in England for more than 2.7m hours. The Lib Dems said that in the same year the firms made PS2.8bn in operating profits and paid out PS27m in bonuses to senior executives. Hugo Tagholm, chief executive of the campaigning charity Surfers Against Sewage, said: 'Water companies are getting away with blue murder - repeatedly dumping raw sewage into areas of special recreational interest, with seeming impunity. 'Our great beach-loving public shouldn't have to swim or surf the gauntlet 0f sewage, pathogens and pharmaceuticals that are pumped out through water company pipes. Surfers Against Sewage has been challenging the water industry for decades, calling for them to put people and planet before excessive profits and executive bonuses. We demand a new decade of ambition to clean up and protect all our bathing waters and blue spaces.'  This article was amended on 2 May 2022 to include a comment from United Utilities.

'There will be a fight over pensions, that's clear - battle has been declared,' said the leftwing CGT trade union in Toulouse. Trade unionists, environmentalists and parties on the left, as well as yellow-vest anti-government protesters, marched in cities across the country - on what is also known as fete du Travail (Labour Day) in France - demanding a rise in pensions and salaries and an end to Macron's plan to gradually raise the pension age to 65. The government said that 45 arrests were made on the edge of the peaceful march in Paris, after a small group of people dressed in black, described as 'black bloc' anarchists, smashed the windows of businesses, including a McDonald's, and attacked cash dispensers while setting bins alight. Police fired teargas and one woman was arrested for attacking a firefighter as he put out a fire. Eight police officers were injured. The centrist Macron, who was reelected last weekend with 58.5% of the vote against the far-right Marine Le Pen, is under pressure to govern differently in his second-term -- with less top-down decision-making and a more participative, decentralised approach, in which citizens would have more input. 'This is a very political May Day, where workers intend to weigh heavily on all the big issues,' said Benoit Teste, head of the FSU teachers' union. 'It's a crucial moment to feel the mood on the ground and set the tone.' 'I want to calm things,' Macron had told locals in a walkabout in south-west France on Friday, after vowing to take into account everyone who voted for him, including those on the left who chose him only to keep out Le Pen. But no details have filtered out on how Macron would consult with citizens or whether he will undertake a reform of France's political system, including introducing an element of proportional representation in parliament. With his second term beginning officially on 14 May, Macron is currently deliberating over who to appoint as the new prime minister who will have expanded powers on overseeing French environmental policy. Some have hoped it would be a woman with a background on the left. Macron has spent recent days still in campaign mode, wading into crowds in town squares in order to listen to voters' concerns, sometimes for hours at a time, to counter his image as haughty and aloof and to show he has understood the current cost-of-living crisis, which is voters' number one concern. This is seen as crucial if he is to secure a broad centrist majority in the parliamentary elections in June that would give him a free hand to implement his policies of overhauling the welfare state and pensions system. The parliament vote has been seized upon by both the far-right Le Pen and the radical-left's Jean-Luc Melenchon, who are seeking to greatly increase their seats in a France where voters are divided and disappointed with politics. 'What we have seen is an extremely strong break between the base of the social pyramid - those who don't have riches nor power nor influence - and the so-called summit,' said Francois Bayrou, the head of the centrist party MoDem, and a key Macron ally, during the campaign. 'There must be a new government approach, which must be constantly in consideration of the French people.' Sylvain Burquier was one of 150 people randomly selected to take part in a citizens' assembly to develop methods for cutting carbon emissions during Macron's first term. Environmentalists criticised the government for not going far enough to follow the citizens' recommendations. But Burquier said the method itself, of forming an assembly of everyday people to thrash out difficult public policy issues, had proved that it worked and should be expanded. 'The 150 of us are convinced that new forms of participative or deliberative democracy can move issues forward,' Burquier said. 'By being a middle path - neither activists nor businesses - we shook things up ... The population was behind us, we're still active today, we upset a lot of people because we were totally transpartisan, and only linked by the common good, not at all by political posturing ... It's a new transversal way of doing things that upsets the status quo and when that happens, things move forward.' Macron has promised his second term would be devoted to tackling the climate emergency, after admitting environmental policy must be speeded up. But an Elabe poll after Macron's presidential win on 24 April found 57% of people didn't believe he would make the environment his top priority. A key policy task in the short term is to address the cost of living crisis. Macron is expected to renew caps on energy costs and consider further anti-inflation payments to low-income households this summer. Ultimately, Macron has promised to get France to full employment. The unemployment rate dropped to its lowest in 13 years during Macron's first term, and its economy - the world's seventh largest - outperformed other big European countries as well as the broader euro currency zone. But with inflation in France reaching a new high of 5.4% in April, while growth stalled in the first quarter, May Day marchers warned that people were angry at the struggle to make ends meet, calling for salaries to be increased and pensions to be raised. Trade unions at the demonstrations said Macron's new plans to raise the retirement age could lead to strike action. During Macron's first term, a different proposed pensions overhaul sparked protests that lasted longer than any strike since the wildcat workers' stoppages of 1968, and the reform was shelved during the pandemic. 'If there's a need to, we'll strike,' the secretary general of the Force Ouvriere trade union told BFMTV at the Paris demonstration. 'Let that be heard. We have our reasons. It's not just pure obstruction, it's based on an economic and social argument.' May Day protests were held in various countries across Europe:", "0143995c58e36b84f8548bdc520054f15992c84a8f039c21540e5091": "Jacob Zuma has been accused of systematic and 'unlawful' efforts to give business allies control of billions of dollars worth of state assets, by the judge charged with investigating wrongdoing during the former president's years in power in South Africa. Raymond Zondo, who was appointed in 2018 to lead an inquiry into allegations of systematic corruption under Zuma's rule, handed his latest report to the current president, Cyril Ramaphosa, on Friday. The 1,000-page document accuses businessmen brothers Atul, Ajay and Rajesh Gupta of being the beneficiaries of Zuma's efforts to fire competent officials, intervene in management decisions, appoint compliant ministers and influence the award of contracts worth huge sums. Zondo said that the Guptas, who came to South Africa from India in the 1990s and built a sprawling commercial empire, had identified Zuma as someone 'whose character was such that [the Guptas] could use him against the people of South Africa, his own country and his own government to advance their own business interests'. Zuma won power in 2009. A populist who was expected to reconnect the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party to increasingly disillusioned voters, he was forced out nine years later amid growing public anger at economic failures and a series of graft scandals. He is on medical parole while serving a 15-month prison sentence after his conviction last year of contempt of court for defying a constitutional court order to testify before Zondo's inquiry. Zuma was jailed for contempt in July last year, a move which set off days of rioting in the KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng provinces in which shops, warehouses and factories were looted and many burned. More than 300 people died in the unrest, the worst in South Africa since the end of the repressive, racist apartheid regime in 1994. ANC officials loyal to Ramaphosa described the violence as 'political sabotage' and a potential attempt at a coup d'etat. After three months behind bars, the 79-year-old politician was released on medical parole for an undisclosed health condition. A subsequent court judgment ruled the medical parole was invalid, but his lawyers are appealing that judgment. Zuma and the Gupta brothers, who left South Africa after Zuma's fall from power and are believed to be in Dubai, deny wrongdoing. They have previously said the allegations against them are politically motivated. The commission has interviewed hundreds of witnesses, viewed tens of thousands of files and obtained phone records among other evidence. The latest report also found that ministers and other officials knew of alleged efforts to steal vast sums from Eskom, the state power utility. Other scandals involve the national airline, which no longer flies, and a series of other state-owned companies. The charges of wrongdoing related to Eskom are particularly sensitive in South Africa, and will cause new problems for the ANC party, in power for 28 years. Chronic lack of maintenance, underinvestment and management failures have left Eskom unable to supply sufficient power to South Africa, resulting in frequent nationwide power cuts that have cut economic growth and hampered recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. In the report, Zondo asked why the ANC government had not acted to prevent the alleged corruption. 'Were they aware of everything but lacked the courage to stop President Zuma and his friends, the Guptas, in what they were doing? Were they looking the other way?' the judge wrote. 'The ANC and the ANC government should be ashamed that this happened under their watch.' Ramaphosa was deputy president from 2014 but the report will harm his enemies and rivals within the ANC more than it damages his own reputation. Analysts say the former union leader and business tycoon has a good chance of winning a second term at polls in 2024. A separate corruption trial of Zuma has been postponed again on Monday pending the outcome of the former leader's appeal to get the state prosecutor removed from his case. The delay is the latest of many as it has been nearly 17 years since Zuma was first charged with corruption, fraud and money laundering related to South Africa's controversial 1999 arms deal. He is charged alongside French arms manufacturer Thales, which is accused of paying bribes to Zuma through his former financial adviser Schabir Shaik, who was convicted on corruption charges in 2005. South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority has accused Zuma of delaying tactics to prevent the start of the trial.

You just have to stay in the sun. Looking more like a rugged digital watch such as Casio's legendary G-Shock than an Apple or Samsung smartwatch, the Garmin feels made to take a beating with its monochrome screen, physical buttons and sturdy body. It costs from PS299.99 ($349.99/A$549) and comes in various versions such as one for surfing and even one for professional truck drivers. But it is the solar charging models, costing PS389.99, that promise never to need to be plugged in for power. Underneath the rugged exterior is Garmin's smartwatch tech, featuring market-leading sport, health and location-tracking. It has smartphone connectivity for notifications, alerts and syncing your data via the Connect app on an Android or iPhone. It is very similar to many other Garmin sport watches, but what sets the Instinct 2 apart is its promise of incredible battery life even without the power of the sun. The standard 45mm model without solar will last up to 28 days used as a general smartwatch, which is 10 days longer than the already impressive Fenix 7 and about 14 times longer than an Apple Watch. The solar version, which charges using a transparent 'power glass' covering the screen and panels around the edge of the display, promises to keep the battery topped up for essentially unlimited battery life as long as you spend at least three hours in direct sunlight (50,000 lux of light). How realistic that is depends on your day-to-day activities. On a sunny winter's day in London the watch received 40,000 lux of direct sunlight through a window, so if you spend your days outside rather than locked in an office it seems more than feasible. For mainly indoor usage during winter without much in the way of solar charging, the watch lasted about 15 days between charges, including five hours of workout-tracking. I wore it 24 hours a day with message alerts, heart rate, stress, calories, general activity and health monitoring, plus sleep and blood oxygen (SpO2) tracking overnight. Turning off the Sp02 sensor added days to the life as did limiting workouts. The solar charging would add at least 24 hours battery for each sunny spring day spent outside, too. Of course its battery prowess comes at the cost of features on fancier-looking Garmin watches such as the Fenix 7 or rivals like the Apple Watch. The Instinct 2 lacks a touchscreen, though the button-based interface is fast and logical. It lacks the new high-accuracy multi-band GPS tracking technology, but still has an altimeter, barometer and compass. The biggest missing features are offline music playback, such as Spotify without having to use your phone, and offline maps. It can plot breadcrumb trails of where you have been on an activity to help you get back to the start, guide you in the direction of points of interest and even measure the area of a space by walking its perimeter, but it has no maps available. The watch tracks a vast number of activities including various forms of running, walking, cycling, swimming, strength, cardio, Hiit and more exotic ones such as paddle boarding, hunting, fishing, backcountry skiing and bouldering. Some activities are restricted to special versions of the watch, such as the jumpmaster mode for skydiving being only available on the 'tactical edition', surfing and tide information on the 'surf edition' and the truck-driver tools on the 'dezl edition' to plan breaks and workouts. Only the solar models have Garmin Pay for contactless payments too, which supports few UK banks but is useful in emergencies when out on excursions without a credit card or phone. On the health front, it has Garmin's excellent body battery, which makes it easy to understand the impact of sleep, activity and rest on your day, plus stress tracking, abnormal heart rate alerts, daily workout suggestions, Vo2 Max fitness measurement and recovery estimation after exercise and many other features. All the activity and health information the watch collects is sent via Bluetooth to the excellent Garmin Connect app on your phone, within which you can pore over mountains of data, graphs and insights. Plus you can connect it straight to social networks such as Strava. The Garmin Instinct 2 comes in two sizes and various models, starting at PS299.99 ($349.99/A$549) for the standard version or PS389.99 ($449.99/A$699) with solar charging. For comparison, the Garmin Forerunner 55 costs PS149.99, Venu 2 costs from PS349.99, Fenix 7 costs from PS599.99, Epix costs from PS799.99, the Coros Apex costs PS299.99 and the Polar Grit X costs PS369. The Instinct 2 Solar is the closest model so far to what is the holy grail of smartwatch makers - a watch which you never have to plug into the charger. It looks and feels more like a traditional digital watch, but is backed by Garmin's comprehensive activity and general health tracking, and simple smartphone notifications. It lacks a few bells and whistles you get with less rugged smartwatch rivals, such as voice assistants, maps, offline music or ECG (heart rhythm) measurement, but its features will probably be more than enough for those not looking for an Apple Watch or similar. If you spend long enough each day in the sun or bright environments you may never need to charge it. For those of us more often confined to the indoors, it'll still last close to a month or longer with some less necessary features disabled. The Instinct 2 is expensive and certainly not for everyone, but if you're an outdoors person or looking for a smarter health-tracking version of a digital watch, the Garmin is great.", "6fee027bce6905d317e8d7816f402082f7c33355e7a198a12e5423b5": "", "5761d25be1eb92a27d4991d3e154ecbe80548b97ef8f4a84b0b7cd06": "", "018bfb5dd8821cbf5a8319b5ad8790197da472392acf68d4889f0945": "", "4ea10fd035ec73f32035b0063b03a69d19de9f983353643a1f39434f": "", "ecc21c4519b20c66b7f2cf85fb8fd279e3da8e29232ff83afeec4533": "", "b095aef66fd4d13217d79c848892b01491311284da0b325ed9b5a222": "", "4ddb5f93b8dc1f71c4714075c2ffdbd6ce8d1904fbe2b46b9897292c": "", "4b6571954b640c47c2ae30d432fae13200d8c196dd70040cebea0ebf": "", "52581a65a8cb4f2f39f9b8a7e6336161b6d924090ad0703ed8c69b1c": "", "3cce600f1c021be63fcc501336186af73ced6cea8dd7e789c7b8221d": "", "8e3e0e437202551932966655001e72890fbf6bc5ff72bc9d5f33ca63": "", "01e98c312b24a1954c46ec003681c3f4545a4432bca40d23cd845f87": "Sitting across from the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda last week, partway through a royal tour to celebrate the Queen's platinum jubilee, Prince Edward laughed awkwardly. Gaston Browne had just asked the prince whether he and his wife Sophie would use their 'diplomatic influence' to push for the payment of slavery reparations to Britain's former colonies. 'We believe that all human civilisation should understand the atrocities that took place,' the Caribbean nation's political leader told the Queen's youngest son. In the same meeting came a second blow. 'One day,' the prime minister told the couple, Antigua and Barbuda - a former British colony where the Queen is still the head of state - would cut ties with the monarchy and become a republic. Prince Edward shuffled nervously in his seat. 'I wasn't keeping notes, so I'm not going to give you a complete riposte,' he said. 'But thank you for your welcome today.' The painful exchange was one in a series of historic moments in the Earl and Countess of Wessex's week-long tour of the Caribbean, the second royal tour to the region in two months to be mired in controversy. By the end of the trip last Thursday, two Commonwealth nations had indicated their intention to cut ties with the royal family and become republics. St Kitts and Nevis also revealed its plan to review its ties with the monarchy. 'The advancement of the decades has taught us that the time has come for St Kitts and Nevis to review its monarchical system of government and to begin the dialogue to advance to a new status,' Shawn Richards, deputy prime minister, told reporters. The declarations follow similar moves by other Commonwealth realms, several of which signalled their own plans to cut ties with the monarchy following a separate tour of the Caribbean by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in March. During that tour, William and Kate were accused of harking back to colonial days after they shook hands with crowds behind a wire mesh fence in Jamaica, and rode in the back of a Land Rover like the Queen did 60 years ago. Protesters accused them of benefiting from the 'blood, tears and sweat' of slaves, while in the Bahamas they were urged to acknowledge the British economy was 'built on the backs' of slaves and to pay reparations. Jamaica's prime minister Andrew Holness told William and Kate that his country was 'moving on' and may be the next to become a republic, while a minister from Belize said it was time to 'take the next step in truly owning our independence'. The latest declarations mean six of the 14 countries beyond the UK that have the Queen as head of state have now indicated that they want to remove her - Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Belize, Grenada, Jamaica and St Kitts and Nevis. If they do they will join countries including Trinidad, Guyana, Dominica and most recently Barbados, which became the world's newest republic in November. The royal tours have also led to renewed calls for reparations - an acknowledgement of the history of enslavement and payment for the damage - from Britain and the monarchy, even from countries with no current plans to cut ties with the Queen. In St Vincent and the Grenadines - which held a referendum on becoming a republic in 2009 that failed to pass when 55% of voters voted against such a move, and has no current plans for another vote - protesters as well as supporters greeted Edward and Sophie during their visit. 'This wrong was done against a sector of the human race by another and this wrong must be compensated,' said Idesha Jackson, 47, one protester who came out during the Wessexes' visit. The controversy has led to concern at the Palace. After returning to the UK in March, Prince William acknowledged the monarchy's days in the Caribbean may be numbered. ''I know that this tour has brought into even sharper focus questions about the past and the future,' he said, adding that the future was 'for the people to decide upon'. On Saturday it was reported that after getting home William and Kate summoned senior staff for a meeting to 'clear the air', with a source telling the Mirror they felt they had been 'poorly prepared'. 'If they aren't in tune with what is going on in the world they will be left fighting for their futures,' the source said. For now, future royal tours would be 'unwise', said Peter Hunt, the former BBC royal correspondent. 'The world has moved on in the wake of the Windrush scandal and Black Lives Matter,' he said. 'Any future trips would be unwise. The role of Britain and the monarchy in the slave trade would feature, and the royals appear ill-equipped to rise to the occasion.'", "86ecc0d58ad3abdde76c530a44149ab8dfde0149304126b4e8fa877c": "", "e8eabc216feb38df5b3630021d71b3dc14edafdf81c108f1db13a374": "Iraq was yet again covered in a thick sheet of orange on Sunday as it suffered the latest in a series of dust storms that have become increasingly common. Dozens were hospitalised with respiratory problems in the centre and the west of the country. A thick layer of orange dust settled across streets and vehicles, seeping into people's homes in the capital Baghdad. Flights were grounded because of poor visibility at airports serving Baghdad and the Shiite holy city of Najaf, with the phenomenon expected to continue into Monday, according to the weather service. 'Flights have been interrupted at the airports of Baghdad and Najaf due to the dust storm,' the spokesperson for the civil aviation authority, Jihad al-Diwan, said. Visibility was cited at less than 500 metres, with flights expected to resume once weather improves. Hospitals in Najaf received 63 people suffering from respiratory problems as a result of the storm, a health official said, adding that the majority had left after receiving appropriate treatment. Another 30 hospitalisations were reported in the mostly desert province of Anbar in the west of the country. Iraq was hammered by a series of such storms in April, grounding flights in Baghdad, Najaf and Arbil and leaving dozens hospitalised. Amer al-Jabri, of Iraq's meteorological office, previously said the weather phenomenon is expected to become increasingly frequent 'due to drought, desertification and declining rainfall'. Iraq is particularly vulnerable to climate change, having already witnessed record low rainfall and high temperatures in recent years. Experts have said these factors threaten to bring social and economic disaster in the war-scarred country. In November, the World Bank warned that Iraq could suffer a 20% drop in water resources by 2050 due to climate change. In early April, Issa al-Fayad, an environment ministry official, had warned that Iraq could face '272 days of dust' a year in coming decades, according to the state news agency INA. The ministry said the weather phenomenon could be addressed by 'increasing vegetation cover and creating forests that act as windbreaks'.", "41431c61920ca88830d9fb2c167323e8d56a326de9826c13e991aa88": "An extremely rare bible famous for an unfortunate error that encourages adultery has been discovered in New Zealand. The 1631 'Wicked' Bible, as it has become known, omits the word 'not' from its seventh commandment, informing readers 'thou shalt commit adultery'. One thousand copies of the text, which also came to be known as the Adulterous or Sinners' Bible, were printed, with the error only discovered a year later. Upon discovery of the mistake, the printers Robert Barker and Martin Lucas were summoned by King Charles I and hauled before the court, where they were admonished for the scandalous typo and sloppy workmanship. They were stripped of their printing licence, had a PS300 fine held over their heads for years (though it was eventually quashed) and most of the texts were destroyed. Only about 20 remain in circulation. The bibles do come up for auction from time to time mostly in Britain or US, but this is the first time one has been discovered in the southern hemisphere, says the University of Canterbury in Christchurch. The university was first informed of its existence in 2018 but chose to keep the discovery under wraps until now to allow researchers and book conservers enough time to study and preserve the book. 'It's a mystery, it's fascinating and it has made its way halfway around the world,' Chris Jones, an associate professor in medieval studies at the university and fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in London, said on Monday. A former student of Jones's brought the copy into to him in 2018 after her family had acquired it two years earlier at a deceased estate sale. The late owner was bookbinder Don Hampshire, who arrived in New Zealand in the late 1950s from the UK and died in Christchurch in 2009, but as far as Jones can tell, Hampshire had never told anyone a thing about owning it. Jones's former student told him she believed it was a 'Wicked' Bible, but he was 'very disbelieving because these are not common items'. 'They are not things that you just walk into an office having found one in a garage in Christchurch. But I looked at it and I thought, wow, this is exactly what my former student thinks it is - it's a Wicked Bible. I was blown away by it.' Jones said there is a copy in Canada, some in the US, others in the UK, Ireland and 'a very nice copy' in Dublin. 'The Australians claim they have one, but they don't,' laughed Jones, adding that their copy does not contain the infamous omission of 'not'. 'Having one come to me in Christchurch is just remarkable.' The discovery of the book piqued Jones's interest in the bible's history and the myths about why the mistake was made, the court case surrounding it, and the printing industry more widely at that time, which he plans to publish papers on. Debate is rife over how the misprint happened, with theories that it could have been a deliberate act of industrial sabotage by a rival printer. But Jones has panned that rumour, saying it is far more likely the printers, who were operating in a cut-throat industry, were just cutting costs on copy-editors. The life of the New Zealand copy, which is owned by the Phil and Louise Donnithorne Family Trust, remains a mystery before it arrived in the country. Where many bibles contain detailed descriptions of family trees, dates, places, and recordings of births and deaths, this copy has just one illegible name. The copy was in relatively poor condition when it was re-discovered, with its cover missing, some water damage, and a few pages at the back gone for good. But it also has some unique features - it is one of a few copies that has the more decorative red as well as black ink and is a much more complete version that many others out there. Book and Paper Conservator Sarah Askey has conserved the item, painstakingly treating the work, fitting a new cover and preserving it for future generations. Askey has documented any little features that could help provide clues as to where the book had been - in between some pages she found plant remnants, human hair and textile fibres. 'It was an awkward little thing to work around ... and there was a lot of problem solving, but that was quite satisfying to do,' Askey said. The book has been now fully digitised and will become free to the public via a website in the coming months - something Jones hopes will help shed more light on the copy's mysterious illegible name scrawled inside. 'I'm hoping someone will come and say 'Chris Jones, you're an idiot, this is really obvious', and I look forward to it.'", "22d6a13906a45e12ee632e2d4d90264150db26bd8cf58fd13b046444": "A senior judge who prosecuted terrorists and is now in hiding in Afghanistan feels 'heartbroken, abandoned and backstabbed' by the British government for refusing to bring him to safety despite a high court ruling in his favour. The high-profile judge, whom the Guardian is not naming for his safety, also received strong support from two former independent reviewers of terrorism legislation. He worked closely with British and American forces to prosecute Taliban, Isis, al-Qaida and Haqqani network terrorists captured in Afghanistan, and is at such high risk that he has to hide in separate locations from the rest of his family, who are also in hiding. He cannot have any direct phone conversations for fear of his location being revealed. A high court ruling on 1 April this year supported his claim for sanctuary in the UK. The UK government has accepted that he is at risk in Afghanistan but says he does not meet the policy criteria for being brought to the UK. Officials said his contribution to the UK's counter-terrorism work in Afghanistan was 'minimal' and that because the court where he prosecuted terrorists captured by the allies was an Afghan institution, he was not a direct employee of the British government. The judge faces having to make a highly dangerous journey to Pakistan to a UK visa-processing centre to get his biometrics done for a visa application. However, if the UK government then refuses the visa, he could be deported from Pakistan back to Afghanistan and placed directly in the hands of the Taliban. The high court ruling from Mrs Justice Lieven states: 'I do accept that if it did happen, it would place JZ [anonymised initials used in the ruling] and possibly his family at real and immediate risk of death.' She added that the UK government had failed to apply discretion to defer biometrics 'in a rational manner'. The former independent reviewers of terrorism legislation Lord Carlile and Lord Anderson wrote to the Home Office on 15 April, urging them to reconsider their decision not to allow the judge to come to the UK. 'The courageous acceptance by judges of the responsibility for incorruptible trial of terrorists ... made an important contribution to the lives of Afghans and to international counter-terrorism efforts,' they said in their letter. In a second case where the government has left Afghans in danger in their home country, an Afghan interpreter who worked for British forces and was badly injured in a Taliban bombing before being relocated to the UK has been trying for eight months to bring his parents and brothers from Afghanistan to safety in Britain. However, a Ministry of Defence (MoD) letter dated 26 April stated that officials had not yet been able to confirm the eligibility of the man's family for the Afghan relocations and assistance policy scheme and urged his supporters not to make the case public. The judge in hiding said through an intermediary: 'I am shocked by the government's decision to refuse to relocate me in the UK. I was once considered an important ally, given security due to the imminent threat I faced and awarded certificates of appreciation for making material contribution to the UK and allies' counter-terrorism mission in Afghanistan. 'I do not regret serving justice upon those who killed innocent people including UK government personnel, but I am heartbroken, abandoned and feel backstabbed by the government for refusing to relocate me in the UK. I plead with them to save my life and the lives of my family.' An MoD spokesperson said officials were unable to comment on individual cases: 'We recognise the challenging circumstances faced by Afghans applying to resettle in the UK through the Afghan relocation and assistance policy (Arap) scheme and are processing applications as quickly as possible. To date we have relocated over 9,000 applicants and their dependants to the UK. The scheme remains open and is not time limited, and we are determined to continue with this work.'", "29d1926a1faeaaa76c11a506022c2e1a2f10bb9fa1c29316e9d0e37e": "The government faces intense pressure from its own MPs and opposition parties to take action over misogyny and harassment in Westminster after a senior minister denied institutional problems, saying the problem was simply 'some bad apples'. A day after the Conservative MP Neil Parish resigned for watching pornography in the Commons, and as yet more allegations emerged about seemingly endemic sexual misconduct, a Tory ex-minister said Kwasi Kwarteng's comments 'dismissed and belittled' the experiences of female MPs. Labour warned that a toxic culture in Westminster was exacerbated by inaction from Downing Street, while its deputy leader, Angela Rayner, wrote to Boris Johnson about reports that one No 10 Christmas party saw a 'sexist of the year' award handed out. Kwarteng, the business secretary, faced significant criticism after rejecting the idea of inherent sexism in parliament, arguing that problems were mainly caused by long hours and overwork, and that very few MPs transgressed. 'I don't think there's a culture of misogyny,' he told Sky News. 'I think the problem we have is that people are working in a really intense environment, there are long hours and I think generally, most people know their limits.' Speaking later to Times Radio, he said the problem was 'some bad apples', who should be punished, adding: 'But that doesn't mean that the entire culture is extremely misogynistic or full of male entitlement. I don't recognise that.' Caroline Nokes, the Tory former minister who chairs the women and equalities committee, said Kwarteng's view went against the testimony of numerous MPs. 'Colleagues shared examples of the aggressions and microaggressions they face every day, and it's being dismissed by a senior cabinet member as the result of working long hours,' she said. 'Once more the experiences of female MPs are dismissed and belittled. That in itself is a classic example of institutional sexism.' Wendy Chamberlain, the Liberal Democrat chief whip, said Kwarteng was 'deluding himself'. She said: 'This is not a few bad apples, it is a culture that is rotten to the core. In the same week that two of his MPs resigned and his female colleagues complained, the worst thing he can do is trivialise and dismiss this.' Keir Starmer argued that with a series of misconduct cases, the government had either tried to ignore the issue or to delay any robust action, saying 'their first instinct is to push it off into the long grass, hide what's happening'. 'That is a political problem, because a fish rots from the head, and there needs to be political leadership on this as well,' he told Sky News. 'And we haven't seen that yet from the Conservative party.' Senior Tories have been pushing to get more female MPs, but Kwarteng said he is not 'a fan of quotas' to boost their numbers. Speaking to LBC radio on Sunday, the senior Labour MP Chris Bryant said that when he was first elected in 2001 he was 'regularly touched up by older, senior gay - they weren't out - MPs', adding: 'I never felt I was able to report it because you end up being part of the story, that's the last thing you want.' The Sunday Times reported a series of claims, including that one MP was accused of licking the faces of male researchers in bars; that a female Tory MP was sent a 'dick pic' by a colleague; and that another MP had been warned about his use of sex workers. The Commons Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, has suggested one way to safeguard staff would be to change the current system by which MPs employ their staff directly, instead doing this centrally. He said he is considering an outside body employing aides as he moved to establish a 'Speaker's conference' bringing MPs together to discuss an overhaul. In Rayner's letter to Johnson, she asked for details about another claim in the Sunday Times, that at a Downing Street party in December 2020 one aide was presented with a 'sexist of the year' award. Rayner also queried whether this had been reported to Sue Gray, the senior civil servant investigating alleged lockdown-breaking gatherings in parallel with a police inquiry. 'You have claimed on the record this week that there is 'no place' for sexism in politics, and yet there are now serious and credible allegations in the Sunday Times that sexist behaviour has not only taken place in your own office, but has been celebrated and rewarded,' Rayner wrote. 'You are ultimately responsible for the culture and activity that takes place within Downing Street under your administration. If true, these allegations are not only at odds with your professed opposition to sexism, but set a terrible example and must result in further action.' The furore over institutionalised sexism in politics kicked off a week ago with a much-criticised Mail on Sunday story citing unnamed Tory MPs saying Rayner would cross and uncross her legs during prime minister's questions to distract Boris Johnson. The paper leaped to its own defence this week, insisting Rayner was the source of the anecdote and that it had been unfairly targeted by opponents of a free press. A Labour source said: 'The vile suggestion that Angela Rayner initiated the sexist smears that have been made against her must be some kind of sick joke.' Parish's departure will pave the way for a byelection in the Tory safe seat of Tiverton and Honiton, and he still faces an investigation by the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS). It was the latest in a series of damning developments that have dogged the Commons in recent weeks. Senior Labour MP Liam Byrne is set to be suspended from the Commons for two days for bullying a member of staff; David Warburton had the Conservative whip withdrawn after allegations of sexual harassment and cocaine use emerged; and former Tory Imran Ahmad Khan resigned after being convicted of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy. The ICGS has told MPs it is 'seeing a similar trend' to the previous year when cases were started against 15 MPs.", "3d33b16c9cb51175f8fee0f6ce6de29a97c9cc485661e955add20c69": "Restaurants across Beijing will temporarily ban dining-in and residents will need negative Covid tests to visit public spaces, officials said on Saturday, in a major ramping up of virus controls at the start of the Labour Day holiday. The five-day break is typically one of China's busiest travel periods, but the country's worst Covid resurgence since early in the pandemic is expected to keep people at home. Faced with the highly transmissible Omicron variant, Chinese officials have doubled down on their zero-Covid policy, quashing virus clusters through mass testing and lockdowns. Despite mounting economic costs and public frustration, the capital city announced it would further restrict access to public spaces during and after the holiday period. From 1 to 4 May, the city's eateries will halt dining-in, and only allow deliveries, local commerce official Ding Jianhua told a press briefing on Saturday. Authorities also said they had so far prepared 4,000 makeshift hospital beds - typically used for patients with light or no Covid symptoms - and were speeding up the setup of larger quarantine sites. A negative Covid test taken within the past week will also be needed starting on 5 May to enter 'all kinds of public areas and to take public transport', according to a notice on Beijing's official WeChat page. For activities such as sporting events and group travel, participants will also need to show a negative Covid test taken within 48 hours, along with proof of full vaccination, according to the new rules. China reported more than 10,700 domestic Covid cases on Saturday, with most in the country's economic engine, Shanghai. The eastern metropolis has been sealed off for about a month after becoming the centre of the latest outbreak. Cases are trending downwards, yet frustration and anger is mounting in the city of 25 million where many have been ordered to stay at home for several weeks. Shanghai officials said on Saturday its new cases had all been found among quarantined or restricted groups - signalling that community infections could be slowing. They added that hundreds of companies on a 'whitelist' had resumed work, with about 1,000 firms also allowed to restart operations, state media said. In Beijing, cases nudged up to 54, according to the national health commission. As the long holiday started, consumers in the capital were asked to show proof of negative Covid tests - from within 48 hours - to enter public areas such as malls, shops and scenic spots. The city will make Covid testing free for residents starting on Tuesday, authorities said.", "7c9296bde0b0c58bd59028631cfe895175692cff00f8cb16e80fb6fa": "Britain's central bank policymakers are 'duty bound' when they meet this week to push the UK into recession to cap rising inflation, a former Bank of England (BoE) official has said. Adam Posen, who runs Washington-based thinktank the Peterson Institute, said that while the Bank of England would not want workers to lose their jobs, it should hike interest rates now to squeeze out inflationary pressures made worse by Brexit trade and immigration restrictions. The BoE's monetary policy committee (MPC) meets on Thursday and is expected to increase interest rates by 0.25%, taking the central bank's base rate to 1% - its highest level since early 2009. Inflation in March peaked at 7% - its highest level for 30 years. Posen, who was a member of the MPC from 2009 to 2012, said the central bank needed to take more drastic action after Brexit reduced the UK's labour supply and limited the flexibility of the workforce. Without a U-turn by the government on trade restrictions and immigration policy, the BoE must shrink the economy. 'The central bank has no choice but to cause a recession when a broad range of prices are rising at such a strong pace,' he said. 'It is duty bound to bring inflation down after more than a year when it has been more than 2 percentage points above its 2% target level during a period of full employment.' He said wages were increasing due to shortages of workers and this was likely to add to inflationary pressures over several years unless further interest rate hikes were imposed. He added that if wages failed to keep pace with inflation over the rest of the year, it showed that the wage bargaining power of workers was weak and there was even more reason to put the brakes on rising prices. 'There is a greater risk of inflation persisting without further action in the UK compared with other major economies. The US is going through a period of high inflation that monetary policy will arrest. Euro area countries don't really have much inflation other than the spike in energy and food prices caused by the Ukraine war. 'The UK, on the other hand, has Brexit, which is going to restrict the supply of labour over the longer term, and trade restrictions that will keep prices higher than they would otherwise be,' he said. Opinion is divided among academics and City analysts over the next steps by the central bank, with some, including Posen's predecessor on the MPC, the labour market economist Danny Blanchflower, arguing that rates need to remain low to protect an economy already heading for recession. Blanchflower, a professor at the Ivy League university Dartmouth College, said several recent indicators showed the UK was already heading into recession and it would be irresponsible for the BoE to give it an extra push. But those calling for a succession of interest rate increases this year argue the faster pace of wage increases and strong levels of savings among middle and higher income groups will mean demand outstrips supply, generating even higher inflation. They say firms lack the skilled workers and raw materials needed to meet demand, and are likely to respond by increasing prices further. Shortages of workers pushed vacancy rates to a fresh record in the latest labour market figures covering the three months to February. The worst affected industries - IT, manufacturing, construction and hospitality - were those that relied most on foreign-born workers, mostly from the EU, Posen said. He added the UK was 'far more open to trade and immigration, and attractive for foreign investment before the 2016 Brexit vote'. Ken Rogoff, a Harvard professor and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, said: 'A recession in Europe is almost inevitable if the war in Ukraine escalates, and the Chinese economy may already be in recession. Writing on the Project Syndicate website, he added: 'And with US consumer prices currently increasing at their fastest rate in 40 years, prospects for a soft landing for prices without a big hit to growth look increasingly remote.' Last week the Brexit opportunities minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said Britain would postpone physical checks on fresh food imported from the EU for a fourth time, citing the likelihood they would cost UK firms PS1bn in red tape. A report last week by researchers at the LSE Centre for Economic Performance said that the introduction of new post-Brexit trading rules last year caused a 'major shock' to UK-EU trade. The research found UK imports from the EU fell by 25% relative to those from elsewhere in 2021. Its authors suggested new rules had also caused many smaller businesses to terminate relationships with suppliers based in the EU and stop exporting to the 27-member trading bloc.", "97827fa18960efd51b439b8d624e903b3865d7378ae7d140adca8b11": "Scrawled in looped handwriting among crates of candles in a walk-in storage cupboard, the pencil lines are still clearly visible on the wall at Audley End house. But for years, what - or who - the list in the 17th-century Essex mansion referred to was a mystery. Now the meaning has finally been unlocked, thanks to two Polish historians. They tracked 80 years of records and found that the list referred to six Polish special forces soldiers who trained at the grand Jacobean property during the second world war. The Cichociemni (the silent unseen) were a specially selected group of special operations paratroopers who were trained to drop behind enemy lines into occupied Poland to take on the Nazis. Audley End, then known as Station 43, acted as a finishing school for 527 of the elite soldiers who volunteered from Polish army units across the UK.  English Heritage will mark the 80th anniversary of the launch of the programme on Sunday, with a new display of exhibits about Station 43, openingon 2 May, which includes documents, pictures and everyday objects adapted for concealing messages. Over more than two years, men trained at Audley End for three-month periods, doing assault courses over the River Cam as they learned underground warfare, but the graffitied names are one of very few visible signs left of the Cichociemni, along with the remains of a timetable stuck to a wall in a former briefing room and ammunition labels inside a laundry cupboard. The six men completed training on 12 April 1944. Dr Andrew Hann, an English Heritage historian, said the latest findings offer valuable insights into the lives of the soldiers who trained on the property. While he had known for a few years that the graffiti was there, 'what we didn't know was what it actually meant'. He added: 'Then a couple of Polish historians came to look around, and my colleague, Peter, showed them into the cupboard. They said, 'Ooh, I think we know what this is'.' After checking their records, they confirmed it was the names of the special forces paratrooper trainees, and Hann started researching them at the Polish Underground Movement Study Trust archive in Ealing, using Google Translate to interpret their personnel files. 'It's been a very slow process,' said Hann. But, he added: 'It's a lot more than we knew before, and it makes them into real people, real personalities, rather than just a list of names.' The six men identified performed some extraordinary feats. Franciszek Socha, who was 29 when he finished training, was a teacher who studied at Lviv university and appeared to be the group's star student. During one mission, he was parachuted into northern France to obtain a specimen of poison gas, but was captured by the Gestapo. He managed to escape by jumping off a moving train and, with the help of the local resistance, made his way to a British submarine. Jan Benedykt Rozycki, then 43, was a former civil engineer from Klimkiewiczow who spoke five languages fluently. He parachuted back into Poland to deliver supplies to the Polish army. Other Cichociemni were hunted down under the postwar Soviet regime, but he stayed. In 1949, he was arrested on false charges and imprisoned for three years, and his son was killed while trying to free him. Eventually, he became director of the Polish Institute of Civil Engineering and died in 1991. The others included Teodor Paschke, 29, from Chodecz, an officer in the prewar Polish army who became a trainer at Audley End, Josef Zbrzezniak, 22, a printing company courier from Warsaw who fought in Italy, Karol Dorwski, 38, a prominent film and theatre actor from Lviv who starred in several prewar movies, and Czeslaw Migos, 23, a sergeant in the artillery who escaped Poland and joined Polish forces in France before being posted to Britain. However, the mystery over the reason for the list - and why some of the names are crossed out - remains. Suggestions include a record of borrowing rubber boots or those who have passed certain courses, but there is no definitive answer. 'It's one of those mysteries we will probably never discover. But what was really exciting is that they're such varied types of people with interesting backstories,' said Hann, adding: 'They're all obviously coming together with a common purpose to fight for their homeland and pushing themselves into the potentially very dangerous situation of being parachuted back into Poland.' The underground warfare course consisted of training in sabotage, field craft, reconnaissance and specialist training in disciplines such as microphotography and wireless operation. During the final stage, before being sent out into the field, soldiers would be briefed on the latest information about Poland, and invent aliases and false identities, as well as being given clothes and false documents. Such was the detail that they would even have their dentistry checked to ensure it was in keeping with their destination, so they would not be found out.", "eb3d4949dca824d46901b8b1ed36b609645f362374a3da20cd281180": "", "9e6d5c02e2c73174451f011ab28c0695529f53044c41e6a214ed7eb2": "", "68317a50a965ec0c3dc2b7aa2ee6114e7ebefe0356ffa7f175769c9f": "The residence of one of Australia's most iconic TV duos, Kath & Kim, is being demolished. Construction company Dig Dig Demolition confirmed to Guardian Australia that workers began knocking down the two-storey house in south-east Melbourne on Monday. Images and videos shot from inside the house show wood and debris strewn across the living room and roof tiles and bricks piled up in the back yard. The four-bedroom house - located in the fictional suburb of Fountain Lakes on the show, but which actually sits at 4 Lagoon Place, Patterson Lakes - was made famous by the hit sitcom. It was last sold in November 2016 for $1.48m. The series aired between 2002 and 2007 on ABC and Channel 7, and gained popularity in Australia - receiving three Logie awards - before an unsuccessful remake was launched in the US. The series was created by Jane Turner and Gina Riley, who played the title characters. It also starred Magda Szubanski, Glenn Robbins and Peter Rowsthorn. Kath & Kim reached a new audience in when it landed on Australian Netflix, with the character's fashion choices and cheesy dialogue sparking another bout of popularity via social media. News of the house's demolition come amid rumours of a revival of the series. Woman's Day reported that an announcement was imminent about a seasonal revival to be broadcast next year.  The magazine reported the reboot would air on a streaming platform. But last year, Szubanski, who played Sharon Strzelecki, said a reunion should be 'off the table' because the show 'holds such a special place in people's memories.' 'If we did a live show which was a best-of or something like that, that's different, but to actually try and do a whole new series - you can never capture that magic again,' she told KIIS FM. 'I feel fine to go off and do Sharon stuff. We don't know that world of Sharon's world.'", "e73d0a29c4b59956acc267d8af02694776d3ae3cd2fd18fcb67a7330": "", "e02b9b4eedda89f15ff26885b9d2651aa0c0361801267317e3107125": "", "defe848f18d7ff8b0bc1474df814090754b4a59bd86c3370afb669c0": "", "27e7a498422114d7500ed010d3bb0eb91d939b6766a80935f61b282a": "", "5a1eb7a99673838b4383e3080bfe32944661eadde30018ad5a6cebf2": "", "adff549d4ced59c8fdabbc30914cc37bfb994efb8e20e30fcd22fde8": "", "c55e9489e9d0a3d723cfc27e3aa0689d3ea8cd42a4f757575ba92afc": "", "fd6c209599c1c1c8802d79e3b98d297e1d01c123d014bab3d33da905": "", "7183c464e9f7c476edc784b2b2b6beaf8e60923ecb4fc3277f900a46": "", "933892aed9c979baf17625367c40feb656e408eda35bd454af569678": "At 4pm on a Friday afternoon in June 2019, Macy Smith, then 17 years old, was driving alone in a white hatchback near Pilot Mountain in North Carolina. The road twisted through a thick forest and a torrential summer storm lashed down. Macy lost control on a corner and the car hydroplaned, hurtling through the trees and flipping over three times before settling in a ravine. She was flung into the back seat and the vehicle pinned her left arm to the ground. Macy was frantic: she stretched for her phone, but couldn't reach it. She listened out for passing cars, but it was a remote spot and they didn't come often. The first went by without stopping, then the next, then a third. It became dark. Macy had lost feeling in the arm that was trapped, and her neck throbbed. By 10.30pm, 28 cars had come and gone. But then the 29th did stop: Macy heard the doors open, and the voices of her stepfather and brother calling her name. They followed the tyre skids down the embankment and her stepfather held her hand through the blown-out sunroof. Macy had kept it together until this point, but now she sobbed. The family had found Macy using the Find My Friends app, which allows users with Apple iPhones to share their location with others. Her mother, Catrina Cramer Alexander, had checked it when Macy hadn't come home and was not answering calls. They then jumped in their car and followed the pulsing blue dot to the ravine. 'Having that location, if we didn't have that, we would have never known where to look,' Alexander told a local TV station. 'I'm certain that that is what saved her life.' What happened to Macy is every parent's worst nightmare, though mercifully there was a happy-ish ending: Macy had a fractured neck and underwent an operation to repair nerve damage in her arm. But it's not hard to imagine a worse outcome. What if her phone had smashed? What if it couldn't get a signal in the forest? 'It's unreal that I survived that crash,' she said afterwards. Find My Friends was unveiled on 4 October 2011, the day before Steve Jobs's death, and has been installed as standard on Apple products since 2015. But the app was not the first or even the market leader: that's Life360, which describes itself as a 'family safety service' and has received funding from Google and Facebook since it was founded in 2008. Standard location-sharing apps, such as Find My Friends on iOS devices and Google Family Link for Android, give a GPS pinpoint for users, which they can either choose to reveal to others or not. Life360 does that too, but - for a fee - you can activate premium features, such as being notified if someone in your circle has been involved in a car accident, or if they have driven above the speed limit or even gone beyond a set 'geo-fenced' area. There is a significant market for these features. Life360 is used by 32 million people in more then 140 countries; it's currently the seventh most downloaded social-networking app on the App Store and its San Francisco-based company has been valued at more than $1bn. A survey of 4,000 parents and guardians in the UK in 2019 found that 40% of them used real-time GPS location tracking on a daily basis for their children; 15% said that they checked their whereabouts 'constantly'. That word 'constantly' will send many teenagers into a cold sweat. At best, location-tracking apps can feel like an extension of helicopter parenting; at worst, they might feel like stalking. While all the apps tend to emphasise that they provide security for the child and peace of mind for the parent, some clearly go into deeper, more invasive territory. One, Find My Kids, allows you to activate the microphone on your child's phone remotely, so you can eavesdrop on their interactions. OurPact gives you access to screenshots of your child's online activity, 'all encrypted for maximum safety'. Bark monitors and scans messages sent from a device, looking for issues such as 'cyberbullying, sexual content, online predators, depression, suicidal ideation, threats of violence, and more'. The app claims to 'cover' almost 6 million children, and has detected 478,000 'self-harm situations' and 2.5m 'severe bullying situations'. Location tracking has become a battleground in many families, bringing up issues of trust, privacy and personal growth. And while the discussion mostly relates to teens, it can start much earlier. Find My Kids, which launched in Russia in 2016 and is now worldwide, notes on its website: 'Youd [sic] kid is too young for a smartphone? Use children's GPS smartwatch!' In the US, the GizmoWatch 2 offers real-time location tracking and is aimed at children as young as three. KIDSnav is pitched at five-year-olds and up and offers GPS tracking and a built-in microphone to listen in on whatever is happening around your child. All parents have to ask themselves what is best for their child. And Macy Smith and her family are in no doubt that location-tracking apps can be invaluable: in fact, after the accident, the family upgraded from Find My Friends to Life360, because of the crash detection and roadside assistance it offers. 'I know it's hard for teenagers to give up your privacy,' Macy told ABC News, 'but sneaking out and being places you don't want your parents to know about is not worth being trapped under a car for seven hours.' In a sense, location-tracking apps have crept up on us. Most parents would agree that planting a chip in your child that monitored their movements and vital signs - as depicted in the Arkangel episode of the dystopian, tech-anxiety series Black Mirror in 2018 - would be a little extreme. But smartphones have put similar technology in all of our pockets and, well, when it's 12.30am and you want to go to bed and your kid's not back from their friend's house, it's pretty difficult to resist. 'If it's on your phone, why would you not look?' says Sonia Livingstone, a professor of social psychology at the London School of Economics and Political Science, who has written extensively on children's rights in the digital age. 'Up till now, parents and children had evolved lots of ways of handling it: 'Phone when you reach your friend's... I won't worry as long as you're home by 11.' But now with the apps and tracking, you know everything. So it's: 'Why did they go to the shopping centre on the way to their friend's? They said they were going to this friend, why are they on that side of town?' Once you've got information, it is almost wrong not to look at it.' Not all teenagers find location tracking an invasion of their privacy. Many are happy to share their whereabouts constantly with their friends: Snap Map, a popular, opt-in function of Snapchat, pinpoints the user's exact position and those in their circle (with alarming accuracy) whenever the app is turned on. Some don't even mind their parents keeping tabs on their movements. 'When I think about it, it makes me feel safe, because I know that Mum or Dad knows where I am,' says Lola Pethybridge, a 17-year-old student from south London. 'Or even my brother' - who is two years younger - 'if it came down to him having to figure out where I was. It's just that safety net where you can say, 'I need help.' Or, 'Can you come and get me?' And the relief of, 'Oh, someone I trust knows where I am.'' Next year, Pethybridge hopes to go to university - will she turn off the family's Find My Friends then? 'Just judging by my habits,' she says, 'I don't think I will.' The subject of location tracking is a more contentious issue with other families. Alicia Hardy, a solicitor from Petersfield in Hampshire, encouraged her two children, Ben and Louise, to use Find My Friends after hearing about it from her sister who lives in the US. Ben, who was 17 at the time, lasted for about a month. 'At that point in my life, I wasn't necessarily that happy about Mum knowing where I was all the time,' says Ben, who is now 23. He smiles, 'I was sneaking out to smoke, so I didn't want Mum to see that I was leaving school.' Louise, meanwhile, was 14 and went along with her mother's Find My Friends request; now 20, they both still use it. 'I introduced it not because I wanted to catch my kids out doing stuff wrong, because frankly, I did stuff wrong, but for me it was more an anxious-mother thing,' explains Alicia. 'Children can be on their phones all day to their mates. But they don't answer their phone to their parents or text them back. And that's really, really irritating for parents, because they systematically would not answer for hours. I tend to catastrophise, whereas Marco doesn't even think about it.' (Marco Hardy, her ex-partner and Ben and Louise's father, agrees: 'I've never even looked at an app or even contemplated it,' he says.) By many objective measures, young people face fewer dangers than they did a generation ago, but it probably doesn't feel like that to their parents. Livingstone has found in her research that daughters are especially likely to be tracked, with concerns about sexual assault and, in recent times, reports of drink-spiking. Many of the apps lean into these worst-case scenarios. One of the add-ons that Life360 offers is Disaster Response: 'Evacuation support in case of natural disasters, active shooter events, and more.' Louise Hardy agrees that, at times, location-tracking apps have made her feel safer, but still has some conflict about them. 'As a kid you're meant to do stuff that your parents don't know about,' she says. 'You're meant to make mistakes, you're meant to mess up. So them always having an eye on you takes away from childhood a little bit. But Mum is a worrier, so it's just a case of keeping her a bit sane.' The Hardy family are clearly very open with each other, and that's important according to Philippa Perry, a psychotherapist and the Observer Magazine's agony aunt. 'Children sometimes want some things to be private,' she says. 'I never used online monitoring with my child because she was an adult before I knew about the software. I relied on that old-fashioned method of asking her where she was going. Once she answered me, 'I'm not telling you.' To which I replied, 'Darling, even Dad has to tell me where he's going so we know where to start the police search.' Which, luckily, she found reasonable.' For Perry, location tracking, like most technology, is neither good nor evil: what matters is the boundaries you set and all parties being comfortable with the negotiation. 'It's not for an outsider like me to say whether or not to use it,' she says. 'Like all things, if you want your children to be open with you and feel like they can tell you anything, don't react angrily or negatively or dismissively when they confide in you. If you have done this in the past and now you have a mute teenager, try to repair that rupture by telling them where you overreacted in the past without making excuses for yourself and say you'll do better next time. And do better next time.' Many teens feel a line has been crossed, especially when their parents make location tracking a condition of paying their phone bill. On the online forum Reddit, on boards such as r/insaneparents and r/raisedbynarcissists, kids share horror stories and screenshots of unhinged interactions with their parents. On TikTok, videos instruct users on how to change their phone settings to fool Life360 into freezing their location ('I broke Life360, you are welcome'). On Twitter, a 20-year-old called Cedar Rose from Kansas City recently made an appeal for $3,000 so they could leave home and their 'homophobic... anti-vax' parents who track their movements constantly on Life360. 'This is my final resort,' they wrote. 'I have no freedom in this house, absolutely none. And I can't take it any more.' To date, Cedar has only raised $510, along with some snide comments that they should 'just get a job'. Whether the use of these apps keeps children safer and more sensible is disputed, but there is obviously the potential to impact relationships between parents and their offspring: certainly where trust has been eroded, location tracking is unlikely to repair the damage. A small study in the Netherlands found that teenagers who were monitored were more secretive and less likely to confide in their parents. 'If young people want their privacy, they'll find a way of getting it,' predicts Livingstone. Where there is more widespread agreement, though, is concern about what happens with the data that is collected. Life360, for example, made $16m in 2020 from selling location data (it is how the app keeps its basic model free, the company states). This information might end up with insurance companies, or realistically with anyone who feels there is a value in paying for it. Livingstone says, 'The idea that children are getting a detailed digital footprint not of their own making that tracks everywhere they go, and that's being used to sell advertising to them now or later, is reprehensible.' It's no spoiler that in the Black Mirror episode Arkangel, the (well-intentioned) use of location tracking ends in disaster: the abject breakdown of trust and understanding between a mother and daughter. ' In the real world, the experiment - that we have only tenuously signed up for - is ongoing and we will experience the results as they happen, with the fallout felt by our loved ones. 'Children have always had times in which they were unobserved and playing outside and generally at risk and coping,' says Livingstone. 'We have a crisis in mental health, so it may all be linked that they're not developing those everyday habits of resilience. But there are some huge unknowns: we have no idea really what it is to grow up when you are constantly observed. So in that sense, we just have to say, we don't know.'", "dd124f549bdf87def9934c6af9b419c197569bab21001b4308383072": "The distinctive sight and sound of a Dartford warbler singing from the top of a sprig of gorse in the May sunshine is making a welcome comeback after the bird almost became extinct half a century ago. Dartford warblers suffered a population crash and were at risk of vanishing from the UK in the 1960s, largely because of loss of the lowland heathland they thrive in. But the RSPB is reporting the highest recorded number of Dartford warblers - 183 pairs - at its reserves including RSPB Arne in Dorset and RSPB Minsmere in Suffolk. As well as needing the cover provided by gorse, the bird is susceptible to harsh weather and was almost wiped out in the big freeze of 1962-3 but recent milder weather has helped it to bounce back. The population has recovered in recent years and by 2019, 23 pairs were found at the Minsmere coastal reserve; the figures show that there are now 37 pairs there. Mel Kemp, the warden at Minsmere, who has overseen heathland restoration at the site, said: 'We have seen a steady increase in the number of Dartford warblers, alongside other species relying on heathland habitats such as nightjar. All the hard work of restoring this habitat has really paid off.' The Dartford warblers are long-tailed warblers; male slate grey and chestnut birds are often spotted singing from the tops of gorse bushes in the spring sunshine, hoping to attract a mate. As well as being the perfect singing platform, the spiky shrub provides a safe nesting place and hunting ground for the bird, which specialises in picking spiders and caterpillars from their hiding places. Heathland supports a range of wildlife, from birds and mammals to insects, reptiles and amphibians but it is one of the UK's most threatened homes for nature, with 80% lost since the 1800s through change of land use. Kemp said: 'We need to continue to restore, manage and protect the heathland we have left here in the UK to best ensure the future of not just the Dartford warbler, but many other species.' As well as doing well in Dorset and Suffolk, Dartford warblers have been seen at RSPB reserves in Devon, Kent, Surrey and Hampshire. The return of the warbler is the second piece of good bird news in a week for Dorset after it was revealed that a pair of ospreys in Poole harbour had produced an egg, the first breeding attempt for the species in southern England for almost 200 years.", "5f74257e165851223645a504691f4cff55884f9ff5693b3c49c438f5": "", "bdd1c637961c578b7cf57644bc74fe7e0d17c9ceabc13c7601a69051": "", "4c2cf9c20f801a50ab0e8feca360b157da30b9ffeb28d9b9e4abbdf2": "", "383d359d6046c2ff48a131182727fb2c897eda1f29718ddfe9835695": "", "7e2ab630e689f3fd15d1036c6b4d088f23bc488ccabb3f18b3b8a321": "", "c282ec8e24bcf2cbc9199606e5889e6235904f46084f89c77bc8fae6": "", "1f71816e9a0940c61796d6db016fced4a37859ec9cf9d11478449d2b": "", "882ddb932710af05691c62bf2d249bc49ea94cea3e30c3014708d6f4": "", "9eb1a91a72f1ab71a7b717144dda3ec6d246ff84bdaa1411b64e6019": "", "bbb5e39aaa93721a58830e02db831e968ca738668064cf159596b5e8": "", "54747aa1d6098dd8ce698d17d1daa3dcee18c528ce830ceeac8accaf": "", "416ef95a0916d1846b525d9e36474cd788cbcdec2e0d36d2a0f9ca45": "", "28095650255c325adc63364045dcb2b83c8cf7c5b7a4599407972ecc": "", "e096cfab39072257ce6c3bba0f0262da96944a3de7e09f0378c3def5": "Around 100 civilians were on Sunday evacuated from the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol, the last holdout of Ukrainian forces in the city.

On Sunday, celebrated as Mother's Day in the United States, Biden will meet with Ukrainian mothers and children who have been forced to flee their homes because of Russia's war against Ukraine, her office said according to Reuters. The wife of president Joe Biden will meet with US military service members at Mihail Kogalniceau Airbase in Romania on Friday, before heading to Bucharest to meet with Romanian government officials, US embassy staff, humanitarian aid workers, and teachers working with displaced Ukrainian children. The trip also includes stops in the Slovakian cities of Bratislava, Kosice and Vysne Nemecke, where Biden will meet with government officials, refugees and aid workers, her office said. Biden's visit is the latest show of support for Ukraine and neighbouring countries that are helping Ukrainian refugees by top US representatives. South Korean ambassador Kim Hyung-tae has returned to Kyiv along with some embassy staff, the news agency Yonhap has reported citing the Foreign Ministry in Seoul. The South Korean embassy was evacuated at the beginning of the Russian invasion and staff had been working at a temporary office in the western Ukrainian city of Chernivtsi since March. The ministry said Kim would start working from Kyiv on Monday and that it was considering the phased return of remaining staff in accordance with the future security situation there. More than 20 embassies, including those of the EU, UK, France, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands, have already reopened in the Ukrainian capital. US secretary of state Antony Blinken said US diplomats would gradually begin returning to the country during a visit to Kyiv last week.  Associated Press has filed a story saying that the Ghost of Kyiv, an unnamed fighter pilot who was praised for supposedly shooting down several Russian planes, is in fact a myth. Adam Schiff, chairman of the US House Intelligence Committee, has told CNN 'it's only a matter of time' before US president Joe Biden visits Ukraine. On Sunday US House speaker Nancy Pelosi became the highest ranking US official to meet Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv since the start of Russia's invasion at the end of February. The House delegation had discussed Zelenskiy's priorities for the next phase of the war, which is concentrated in the east of the country after Russian forces withdrew from around the capital, and Biden's request for a $33bn aid package for Ukraine, Schiff said: Russia's top uniformed officer, General Valery Gerasimov, visited dangerous frontline positions in eastern Ukraine last week in a bid to reinvigorate the Russian offensive there, the New York Times has reported citing Ukrainian and US officials.  The Guardian was unable to verify the report. During the visit, Gerasimov, chief of the Russian general staff, narrowly escaped a deadly Ukrainian attack on a school being used as a military base in the Russian-controlled city of Izium late Saturday, the Times reported.  Around 200 soldiers including at least one general were killed in the strike, a Ukrainian official told the paper, but Gerasimov had already departed for Russia.  The Institute for the Study of War, a US-based think tank, earlier said that Ukrainian forces had 'likely conducted a rocket artillery strike on a Russian command post in Izyum on April 30 that struck after Russian chief of staff Valery Gerasimov had left but killed other senior Russian officers.' US officials could not confirm the attack and the Russian Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 'Our working assumption is that he was there because there's a recognition they haven't worked out all their problems yet,' one of the US officials told the Times. The Russian offensive has been slow, with widespread disarray and poor morale reported among Russian forces. The Kremlin appears to be focusing its operations around the city of Izium as part of renewed efforts to seize the entirety of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Gerasimov has reportedly been put in command of the push. Two explosions have taken place in the early hours of Monday in Belgorod, the southern Russian region bordering Ukraine, Vyacheslav Gladkov, the region's governor has written in a social media post. 'There were no casualties or damage,' Gladkov wrote, according to Reuters. On Sunday Gladkov had said one person was injured in a fire at a Russian defence ministry facility in Belgorod, while seven homes had been damaged. Posts on social media said fighter jets and loud explosions had been heard above the city overnight. The Guardian was unable to verify the reports. Russia last month accused Ukraine of a helicopter attack on a fuel depot in Belgorod, for which Kyiv denied responsibility, as well as shelling villages and firing missiles at an ammunition depot. A few more images captured by Reuters of the evacuation of civilians from the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol, showing emotional scenes as people were reunited with family members in the village of Bezimenne in the Donetsk region: Around 100 civilians were on Sunday evacuated from the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol, the last holdout of Ukrainian forces in the city. Around 1,000 civilians and 2,000 Ukrainian fighters are thought to be sheltering in bunkers and tunnels underneath the plant, enduring a weeks-long siege with little food or water. One of the civilians evacuated spoke to Reuters, telling the news agency, 'We didn't see the sun for so long':  Hello, this is Helen Livingstone taking over the blog from Maanvi Singh to bring you the latest from the war in Ukraine. First a bit more from Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov's interview with Italy's Mediaset broadcaster. He said that Russia was not demanding the 'surrender' of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy as a condition for peace. He also denied that Russia would attempt to claim victory in Ukraine by 9 May - when Russia marks the end of the second world war with Victory Day - saying that the Russian military would not 'artificially adjust their actions to any date, including Victory Day.' Asked about recent rumours concerning the health of president Vladimir Putin, he did not answer directly, saying instead:  - Jennifer Rankin, Harry Taylor, Maanvi Singh, Rob Booth In Kherson, the first major city to fall, Russia is replacing Ukrainian currency with Russian rubles.  Per AFP, Kirill Stremousov, a civilian and military administrator of Kherson said that 'beginning 1 May, we will move to the ruble zone,' according state news agency RIA Novosti. It is a tactic to legitimize Russia's 'control of the city and surrounding areas through installing a pro-Russian administration,' according to an intelligence update released by Britain's Defense Ministry. The move is 'indicative of Russian intent to exert strong political and economic influence in Kherson over the long term,' the Defense Ministry said.  Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said that the county is working to prevent nuclear war, Reuters reports.  In an interview with Italian TV, Lavrov said: 'Western media misrepresent Russian threats. Russia has never interrupted efforts to reach agreements that guarantee that a nuclear war never develops'. Lavrov also doubled down on Russian conspiracy theories and propaganda about Nazism in Ukraine.  This week, Pentagon press secretary John Kirby called Russia's justification for the war in Ukraine 'BS'. 'It's hard to square [Vladimir Putin's] ... BS that this is about Nazism in Ukraine, and it's about protecting Russians in Ukraine, and it's about defending Russian national interests, when none of them, none of them were threatened by Ukraine,' Kirby said. 'It's brutality of the coldest and the most depraved sort.' Eight have died after Russian attacks on Donetsk and Kharkiv, according to the governors of those regions.  AFP reports:  Ukrainian president Volodomyr Zelenskiy said that evacuations from Mariupol will continue tomorrow if 'all the necessary conditions' are met. 'Today, for the first time in all the days of the war, this vital corridor has started working,' he said. 'For the first time there were two days of real ceasefire on this territory.' In his latest address, he said:  Isobel Koshiw and Ed Ram in Kharkiv report:  In Ukraine's second city, where the barrage of Russian shelling has been among the most relentless endured, hundreds of people stand in line at a post office, waiting to be given chicken and potatoes. As elsewhere in the country, the mundane institutions of civil society of Kharkiv have had to be hastily repurposed for the goal of keeping its population alive, and about 30 such locations across the city have been turned into food aid distribution points. The postal workers at this branch of Nova Poshta, who are being paid by their employer to hand out food instead of post, say that an average of 3,000 people come to their repurposed branch every day, seven days a week. They manage the queues using the post office's ticket system. 'There's no work. The No 1 thing at the moment is humanitarian aid,' says Ihor Shapovalov, a construction worker who lost his job on 24 February and has just received a quarter of a chicken. 'We just want to thank the guys for everything they're doing.' Kharkiv has been the worst-hit city still under Ukrainian government control. Since the war began two months ago, civilians have died and been injured almost every day as a result of incoming Russian shelling. On Saturday, one person died and five were injured as a result of mortar fire, according to the regional governor. The city is starting to see signs of life, but its economy is in tatters. The vast majority of shops and businesses are still closed. Another man waiting in the queue at the repurposed post office is 30-year-old Zhenia Myrhorod. He says he had tried to get work unloading humanitarian aid at a warehouse, but there was not enough work to go around. 'I even collected metal from the missiles but couldn't find anyone to buy it,' says Myrhorod. 'I'm 30 years old. I've got legs and arms, but nobody wants them.'

The civilians had been sheltering in bunkers beneath the steelworks that is the last redoubt for Ukrainian forces in Mariupol.  On Sunday, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said about 100 civilians evacuated from the steel works and would arrive in the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia on Monday morning.  'For the first time, we had two days of a ceasefire on this territory, and we managed to take out more than 100 civilians - women, children,' Zelenskiy said in a nightly video address. He said he hoped evacuations would resume on Monday at 8am local time (0500 GMT). The head of the Donetsk Regional Military Administration later said the evacuation would begin at 7am (0400 GMT). As many as 100,000 people are believed to be in the blockaded city, which has endured some of the most terrible suffering of the Russian invasion. These include 1,000 civilians and 2,000 Ukrainian fighters thought to be sheltering underneath the Soviet-era steelworks, the only part of the ruined city not taken by Russian forces. After enduring a vicious weeks-long siege that forced people into confinement in basements, without food, water, heat or electricity, Russian forces closed in, leaving the steelworks as the last remaining stronghold. Vladimir Putin decided not to storm the plant, but called on Russian troops to blockade the area 'so that a fly can't get through'. The UN confirmed on Sunday that a 'safe-passage operation' to evacuate civilians had begun, in coordination with the International Committee of the Red Cross, Ukraine and Russia, but declined to give further details in order to protect people. Zelenskiy's chief of staff Andriy Yermak suggested the evacuations could go further than just the civilians holed up in the steelworks. 'This is just the first step, and we will continue to take our civilians and troops out of Mariupol,' he wrote on Telegram. Earlier, Reuters reported that more than 50 civilians in separate groups had arrived from the plant on Sunday in Bezimenne, a village about 20 miles (33km) east of Mariupol in territory controlled by Russian-backed separatists. The group arrived in buses with Ukrainian number plates as part of a convoy with Russian forces and vehicles with UN symbols. An evacuee in Bezimenne, Natalia Usmanova, 37, told Reuters she had been so terrified as Russian bombs rained down on the plant sprinkling her with concrete dust that she felt her heart would stop. 'When the bunker started to shake, I was hysterical. My husband can vouch for that. I was so worried the bunker would cave in,' she said. 'We didn't see the sun for so long... You just can't imagine what we have been through - the terror.' Russia's defence ministry said on Sunday that 80 people, including women and children, had left the Azovstal works, according to the state news agency Ria Novosti. Russian forces have obliterated the port city of Mariupol, a major target for Moscow because of its strategic location near Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014. In other developments: News of the Azovstal steel plant evacuations came as the US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, met Zelenskiy in Kyiv, where she pledged enduring support for his country's 'fight for freedom'. Pelosi, whose visit was not announced beforehand, is the highest-level US official to meet the Ukrainian president since the war began. 'We are visiting you to say thank you for your fight for freedom,' she said in video footage released on Zelenskiy's Twitter account. 'And that your fight is a fight for everyone, and so our commitment is to be there for you until the fight is done.' Speaking at a press conference in Poland on Sunday, Pelosi said the US would hold its resolve, after being asked whether Washington was concerned about its support provoking a Russian reaction. 'Let me speak for myself: do not be bullied by bullies,' she said. 'If they are making threats, you cannot back down.' Last week Joe Biden called for a $33bn (PS26bn) package of military, humanitarian and economic support for Ukraine, more than doubling the level of US assistance to date.  While the US is increasing support for Ukraine, Germany's chancellor rejected criticism that Berlin was not doing enough. In an interview with Bild am Sonntag, Olaf Scholz said he took decisions 'fast and in concert with our partners'. Meanwhile it emerged that the EU is looking at banning Russian oil imports from the end of 2022, in the latest effort to cut funds to Vladimir Putin's war machine.  Russia continued its refigured campaign to seize parts of southern and eastern Ukraine, after failing to take Kyiv. On Sunday, Russia's defence ministry said it had attacked an airfield near Odesa and claimed to have destroyed a hangar that contained weapons provided by foreign countries.  Meanwhile, the governor of Kharkiv warned residents on Sunday not to leave shelters because of 'intense shelling'. Oleh Synyehubov asked residents in the north and eastern districts of the city, especially Saltivka, not to leave their shelters unless it was urgent.

Then the difficult questions began. Were the heroic exploits of Denis Avey really all they seemed? Was his dramatic claim he had swapped places with a man inside a concentration camp possibly a fake? In spite of growing doubts, Avey's story that he saved the life of a Jewish prisoner by placing himself in danger while he was being held in a prisoner-of-war sub-camp near Auschwitz is still in popular currency. But now a dogged historical researcher, working to document the history of the German POW camps and concentration camps in Poland, is demanding the return of the price he paid for his copy of Avey's 2011 autobiography and suggesting that other readers do the same. The story laid out by Avey is full of holes, according to the British-Israeli researcher Alon Shapira, and therefore damaging to the integrity of Holocaust history. This weekend the Observer has learned that Hodder & Stoughton, publisher of The Man Who Broke Into Auschwitz, plans to include qualifying notes in any future edition of the influential book, which remains in print. The move would follow a decision recently taken by the Holocaust Education Trust to dissociate itself from the flawed historical narrative it contains of Avey's incarceration as a POW in Poland. This is despite the fact the organisation originally put forward Avey's name for the honour of being named a British Hero of the Holocaust. In a statement to the Observer this weekend, the trust said: 'Upholding the truth and integrity of the Holocaust is vital, and when new information comes to light it must be taken seriously.' The Imperial War Museum, which first interviewed the late Avey about his wartime experiences, has also distanced itself from the story of this Englishman, who was certainly held nearby as a POW, and who then claimed to have briefly switched identities with a Jewish camp inmate in order to help him and to verify the horrors committed inside. The museum's file containing Avey's testimony has now been flagged with a public warning. 'This story needs to be corrected as soon as possible by the publishers so that the real facts can be passed on to the next generation,' said Shapira. James Long, a British author who knew Avey before his death seven years ago and who helped research the original book, is now also keen for the next edition to contain a full acknowledgment of the questions and doubts since raised about Avey's memories. 'I would like to provide more of the background information and include some of the questions that have been raised since,' he said. But Shapira's discoveries of a series of discrepancies in Avey's story have now mounted up into a big potential problem for Hodder & Stoughton. While wartime memories are likely to become confused for any survivor, the accumulation of conflicting detail and changes to Avey's recollections are now impossible to ignore. First, a similar account of a prisoner swap with a camp internee was originally printed in a book called The Password Is Courage, about the mysterious and not always trustworthy wartime character, Charles Coward. This narrative also uses the phrase 'the man who broke into Auschwitz'. Avey's defenders, among them Long, argue that Coward may actually have appropriated the story of Avey's brave mission, rather than the other way around. Second, Avey initially told the Imperial War Museum that he had swapped with a Birkenau prisoner called Ernst. He later changed the location of the camp to a factory worker site and the identity of the Jewish camp survivor to a man called Hans, who has never been traced. It is possible, the publisher's researchers have argued, that Avey innocently mixed up the location of the work camps next to his POW camp with the infamous death camp Auschwitz-Birkenau, which was several miles away. Among other conflicting assertions to have come to light, Avey also failed to mention that his father, who lived until 1960, was with him in his POW camp. In the book, Avey specifically said he had no knowledge of his father's wartime experiences, as the two had never discussed them. 'I don't think he ever knew that I had been in a camp near Auschwitz,' Avey wrote. Now Shapira has produced a German POW record for Avey's father, seen by the Observer, that shows he spent time in the same prison as his son, a facility known as E715. Those protective of Avey's reputation point out they believe there were between 800 and 1,000 prisoners in E715 and that it might still have been possible for father and son to have been in different buildings. Shapira's argument that a battered photograph of POWs that appears to show father and son together is not conclusive, they argue. The publisher's new plan to consider adding amendments and contextual notes of queries and doubts to Avey's account, which was written with journalist Rob Broomby, comes after an official response from Hodder & Stoughton last week that said it stood by Avey's original account. 'We have no reason to question the veracity of Denis Avey's book, The Man Who Broke Into Auschwitz,' it reads. Referring to previous attempts to question the facts in the autobiography, the response continues: 'Avey and his father were not in the same prison camp, E715, as the book makes completely clear,' and it concludes, 'Denis Avey's book is not in any way based on or derived from the Charles Coward book.'", "de0825c85e9386e761dad3dc218fa68c71bbbeb32dc3a90d609df525": "The family of Hotel Rwanda hero Paul Rusesabagina has filed a $400m lawsuit in the US over his alleged abduction and torture. Rusesabagina is serving a 25-year prison term on terrorism charges after a trial his supporters say was a sham and riddled with irregularities. 'The complaint alleges that the government of Rwanda and high-ranking Rwandan officials conspired to facilitate and execute an elaborate plot to lure Paul Rusesabagina from his home in Texas to Rwanda, where he would be tortured and illegally detained for the remainder of his life,' the family and his lawyers said in a statement on Saturday. A copy of the lawsuit seen by AFP indicates that it was filed in a Washington DC court on 22 February. It was served on the Rwandan government on 8 March. Rusesabagina's family and lawyers will hold a press conference in Washington on Wednesday to announce further details of the suit, which is seeking at least $400m in compensation as well as punitive damages. The lawsuit names the government of Rwanda, its president, Paul Kagame, and other figures including the former justice minister and intelligence chief. Rusesabagina, then a Kigali hotel manager, is credited with saving hundreds of lives during the 1994 genocide and his actions inspired the Hollywood film Hotel Rwanda. He used his fame to denounce Kagame as a dictator and has been behind bars since his arrest in August 2020, when a plane he believed was bound for Burundi landed instead in Kigali. The family statement said Rusesabagina, who has a US green card as well as Belgian citizenship, was tricked into travelling from his US home with the promise of work in Burundi. 'Instead, he was drugged and taken to Rwanda, where president Paul Kagame's security agents forcibly abducted him, tortured him, and forced him into illegal imprisonment.' The government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Rusesabagina was convicted in September of involvement in a rebel group blamed for deadly gun, grenade and arson attacks in Rwanda in 2018 and 2019. His 25-year jail term was upheld by Rwanda's court of appeal earlier this month, a ruling his family says is effectively a death sentence for the ailing 67-year-old.", "1bbe2fb5e20415ae5d806dd022535565b725d3f7e86c527a64b8d714": "", "e1b542f5cb80976a2fa3c2eb914d7d045c98e853f4b7aeebbf11a3fa": "", "c521b8f72ee9ffef237eafe8a6842c481edadf3d08e7309113e5023f": "", "6cd2bb70562b3c806d8600cabcf55a22d48872e0997088614f00f226": "If Stephen Smartt gets lucky, he may one day receive a message that will give the astrophysicist an advance warning that one of the most extraordinary displays known to science is about to light up the night sky. Signals relayed by automated telescope arrays and underground detectors will reveal that a star in our galactic neighbourhood has just turned supernova. A supernova occurs when a star destroys itself so completely it can outshine the combined light of an entire galaxy. In the last thousand years, only five have ever been visible to the naked eye. Ironically, all occurred before the invention of the telescope. 'We know about supernovae from their appearance in other galaxies and from remnants left behind in our own galaxy,' says Smartt, an astrophysicist based at Queen's University Belfast. 'But what we would love to do is see one that appears fairly near us so we can study it with modern telescopes and detectors.' When a supernova erupts, it sprays the cosmos with heavy elements - so observing one nearby would provide precious information about the creation of matter in our galaxy. 'Most elements heavier than oxygen were created in a supernova before being hurled across space,' says Prof Mark Sullivan of the University of Southampton. 'These atoms provide the galaxy with material essential to life. The calcium in your bones and the iron in your blood - as well as the gold in the ring on your finger - were all created in supernovae explosions.' It is an image that continues to entrance writers and artists. In Jeanette Winterson's words, astronomers have shown our first true parent was actually a star and that we are made of elements that are 'the long-lived radioactive nuclear waste of the supernova bang'. Or, as Joni Mitchell put it, more simply: 'We are stardust.' The most common type of supernova occurs when a very large star runs out of fuel, halting the nuclear fusion process that keeps it shining. The star's outer layers fall inwards, and protons and electrons are crushed together to form neutrons that become packed into a superdense ball. Matter continues to rain down on this neutron ball before bouncing back, triggering a shock wave that destroys the star. All that is left behind is a neutron sphere that is so dense a matchbox of it would weigh about 3bn tonnes. And if the original progenitor star that led to the supernova was particularly large, this neutron star will become so heavy it will form a black hole from which nothing can escape, not even light. This is a core-collapse supernova and it can unleash more energy than our sun will release over its entire 10bn-year lifetime. If a star in our galaxy, too distant to be seen by the naked eye on Earth, becomes a supernova, it will suddenly shine so brilliantly it could be seen in daylight. Scientists estimate that on average about 20 supernovae occur in a galaxy such as ours every thousand years. Yet only five have been observed in the last millennium. East Asian and Arabic records indicate there were supernovae in 1006, 1054 and 1181, while European documents recall ones that occurred in 1572 and 1604. The first of this last pair flashed into sight in November 1572 and was observed by the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe. 'Overhead, a certain strange star was suddenly seen, flashing its light with a radiant gleam,' he recalled. 'I stood still, gazing ... When I had satisfied myself that no star of that kind had ever shone forth before, I was led into such perplexity by the unbelievability of the thing that I began to doubt the faith of my own eyes.' But if supernovae are so brilliant, why have we only detected five in the past 1,000 years? Why have we not seen a number that is nearer the 20 suggested by observations of other galaxies? The answer is straightforward, says Sullivan. 'Our galaxy is like a flat plate and our solar system is about two-thirds of the way towards its edge. A supernova that occurs on the other side of the plate will simply be obscured by all the dust and stars that lie at the centre of the galaxy.' Astronomers have since observed supernovae in other galaxies and studied remnants of those that have occurred inside our galaxy. These include the glowing filaments of the Crab Nebula, the remains of the supernova that lit up night skies in 1054AD and which have since been spreading across space. Galactic debris such as this reveals the enormous destruction that is unleashed by supernovae. Yet these stellar convulsions are also important engines of creation, scientists argue. Apart from spraying the cosmos with heavy elements on which life depends, they also play a key role in planet and star formation, says astrophysicist Cosimo Inserra of Cardiff University. 'A supernova sends shock waves across a galaxy and these strike clouds of gas and dust in space, compressing them so that proto-stars start to form at their centres. Eventually, nuclear fusion begins, igniting a star's store of hydrogen and it starts to shine. Planets form and orbit the star. That is probably how our sun and solar system came into existence.' Supernovae do pose threats, nevertheless. 'If one occurred within 20 parsecs - roughly 60 light years - of the Earth, its intense cosmic rays could destroy our protective ozone layer, which would allow increased levels of ultraviolet radiation from the sun to reach us,' says Sullivan. However, only one very close to Earth could have such an impact and at present there are no candidate stars near us that look ready to annihilate themselves this way, he adds. On the other hand, it is also clear supernovae have exploded near Earth in the past. As evidence, scientists point to the discovery of a radioactive isotope of iron - known as iron-60 - that has been found in seabed deposits laid down 2.5m years ago and in other deposits created about 7m years ago. Iron-60 is produced by supernovae and these deposits suggest at least two must have erupted near Earth within the last 10m years, probably at a distance of about 100 parsecs, or 320 light years. What impact that had on the planet is uncertain. 'You might have had a rise in cosmic-ray activity and this might have affected cloud formation on Earth or reduced the amount of solar radiation reaching the ground,' says Prof John Ellis of King's College London. 'This could then have triggered a change in the climate, which in turn could have affected the course of human evolution.' Apart from the rather startling prospect that the appearance of Homo sapiens might have been shaped by local supernovae, these discoveries also suggest there might have been enough of them to have had a real influence on life earlier in our planet's history. 'If you find two that happened fairly near Earth within the past 10m years, that suggests hundreds must have appeared over the past billion years,' argues Ellis. 'Some of them will have been quite distant ... but a few would have been close, say 10 parsecs away. And we should be clear: if a supernova went off within 10 parsecs of our planet, it would very likely have caused a mass extinction.' Earth has experienced at least five mass extinctions that have each eradicated thousands of species of animals, plants and sea creatures, and at least one of these was caused by an extraterrestrial agent: an asteroid that struck Earth at the end of the Cretaceous period 66m years ago, wiping out the dinosaurs. Earth-based catastrophes - such as large-scale volcanism - have been blamed for the other mass extinctions. However, scientists now suspect that in one other case, an otherworldly event was to blame. They point to rocks that formed at the end of the Devonian period 360m years ago when there was another mass extinction that wiped out ammonites, trilobites and other early forms of life. These rocks contain hundreds of thousands of generations of plant spores that appear to be sunburnt by ultraviolet light - evidence of a long-lasting ozone-depletion event, says astronomer Brian Fields at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. 'We propose that one or more supernova explosions, about 65 light years from Earth, could have been responsible for the protracted loss of ozone,' he argues. This blast would have first bathed Earth with powerful X-rays and gamma rays before debris from the blast slammed into the planet, stripping it of its protective ozone layer. This astronomical double whammy would have exposed the planet's surface to deadly radiation for up to 100,000 years and led to a mass extinction. Further proof for this idea is now being sought by scientists. They have discounted looking for iron-60 atoms because these decay too quickly to have survived the 360m years since the late Devonian mass extinction. Instead, they plan to seek out atoms of the isotope plutonium-244, which is also produced by supernovae and could survive for a few hundred million years. That research is now under way. In the meantime, scientists are preparing themselves to react as speedily as possible to the first signs that a nearby supernova has begun. Crucially, these first signals will not come flashes of light but will emerge from underground detectors designed to spot the universe's most insignificant entity, the neutrino. 'Neutrinos are the first thing that will emerge from a supernova,' says Smartt. 'They are so insubstantial, they are very difficult to detect and instruments have to be put in places where they do not pick up spurious signals from other sources. 'However, if enough are detected, then an automated alert will be sent out and the arrays of telescopes that we use to study the night sky will be turned towards the sources of those neutrinos. Then we will be ready to study the first bursts of radiation and light emerging from the supernova and to watch how it unfolds.' While scientists are confident a supernova will occur in 2022, whether it occurs in our galaxy is a different matter. In any given year, it is an unlikely prospect. On the other hand, one day it may just happen in our galactic neighbourhood. If it does, astronomers say they will be ready.", "89d68163e7fe4155b9557574d953286cb825397c6733ec4bbd279444": "On the streets of Enniskillen, a handful of twentysomething women, all from a unionist background, discuss this week's elections. The Northern Ireland protocol does not come up once, but what does surface repeatedly among 18- to 34-year-olds asked open questions about their voting intentions is the frustration with the framing of this election, like many before it, as a vote on the constitutional question of whether Northern Ireland should remain part of the UK or unify with Ireland. 'It's the scaremongering I don't like. People telling you you have to vote DUP to keep the other side out,' says one 25-year-old worker who wanted to remain anonymous. 'I'm a unionist, but I'm not going to be influenced by that protocol stuff. What's important for me is the health stuff. You have to stand up for women's issues, that's important,' she adds, shorthand for why she is not voting for the DUP. 'To be honest I think all the parties have let everyone down. I've been waiting for two weeks just to get an appointment with the GP,' she says. She is a 'from a unionist background' but voted remain and says she will probably vote for the Ulster Unionist party because of 'things like abortion and women's issues'. She has no interest in the constitutional question and the tribal voting. 'Until people stop viewing things as unionist or nationals, Northern Ireland will never change,' she says. The Enniskillen straw poll shows that young people, who have no memory of the Troubles, yearn for a day when polarised nationalist-versus-unionist arguments, which polls show are popular with older voters, are over. 'I was brought up a Protestant but I'm not really that influenced by that. Me and my siblings will vote for progression rather than religion,' says her friend. Down the street are young parents Grace Hoy, a primary school teacher who is looking at voting for the Green party, and her physiotherapist husband, Mark, who is looking at an independent 'cross community' candidate, Donal O'Cofaigh. 'It's just a bit of a circus this election,' says Grace, 27. 'People focus too much on stopping the other side getting in. I'm not voting for people who want to bicker or fight over these silly issues. 'The issues for me are healthcare, the lack of childcare, support for young families.' Away from the headline battles between Sinn Fein and the DUP and the turmoil within unionism, the question for post-conflict Northern Ireland is whether constitutional politics will ever be remote enough to be in the rear-view mirror. A LucidTalk poll for the Belfast Telegraph in March put the combined support for the Alliance party, the Green party and other non-aligned rivals such as People Before Profit at 24%, with their most recent survey results on Friday showing a slight fall to 21%. It is a sizeable chunk compared with Sinn Fein at 26% and the DUP at 20%, according to the poll commissioned by the Belfast Telegraph, but is it enough? The Alliance party will be the sanctuary for many votes eschewing the constitutional political positioning of the main parties, with some predicting they could add between three and five seats to their existing eight. It will mean a larger presence in Stormont, but with 90 seats to be taken it will still be a minority. 'This is not going to be the election where people cross the Rubicon in significant numbers,' says Peter Shirlow, director of the Institute of Irish studies at the University of Liverpool. 'People say they're fed up, say they want it all to stop. They don't want the election to be about the legacy, they want the end to arguing, they want a different assembly, but the thing about it is, most of the people who feel that way is they don't vote.' However, he believes the proportional representation system could deliver some results for those in the middle. 'What we are seeing is there is a growth for those non-constitutional parties, but where they're very strong is in second preferences. That could theoretically be a gamechanger,' he says. Launching the Alliance party's manifesto last week, Naomi Long, its leader, expressed frustration that those who support the non-aligned parties do not have the same voice as the unionists and nationalists because of the consociational system set up for post-conflict powersharing. She said she wanted an end to the system whereby members of the legislative assembly (MLAs) are designated as unionist, nationalist or other. 'About 15% of MLAs currently are non-aligned in the assembly, yet we still count for less in votes on key issues. We cannot say that our community are all equal if within the heart of the institutions which govern this place there is inequality and disrespect for people's rights. 'I believe that the days of designations are over. The Good Friday agreement allowed us an opportunity to manage our divisions, but surely as a society that cannot be the ceiling of our ambitions.'", "29a8edd4ebdbe124b6f8bc35e3d3855e6f7d7a5ce4954e1f355ae500": "", "5bf05ccb915eebcb1f0bead25bf250cbe896db9a33e3b2799df5de08": "", "b0a19cb72166807976a6e75ad9e54d7186dd23126ce7e8f119e325a5": "", "e151922e0fa44d28debedb130d73e6651792d5cbac2a2e1a7e5c031b": "", "2c56a5651b602186947d4eaf11a08abdbe77ab0d540d85d2d018d580": "", "95c2091e4646e9ad2a807feba8a3c98c7871baf00e1b310524f01d02": "", "2f0b1b149f71ca3ee8173a33690ca320f74661b9221b12e687c54280": "", "b0abe2444cd8707f063786a75dffd60b57235e7a51a382580316d49b": "", "c290446afbd26dedddb88725740df8d0b06aef80307537894bdae212": "", "5112f866199413202a39e796f2734bd819484d5b40d9c81846386948": "", "4c5b3400a498f23feceb772cdc54fab8ecb54383bc4e43a63f696c03": "Ministers are under increasing pressure to help free a retired British geologist at risk of facing the death penalty in Iraq over smuggling allegations. A petition urging the release of father-of-two Jim Fitton, 66, has received more than 95,000 signatures in the three days since it was launched. His daughter Leila and her husband, Sam Tasker, from Bath, in Somerset, have also disclosed the sentencing this month is expected to coincide with a long-planned celebration of their wedding. They said: 'There is never a good time for something like this to happen but we are one week away from what should be the happiest day of our lives, and the culmination of more than two years of planning, and it's been turned into an absolute living nightmare. 'We have accepted the fact that, without timely intervention from the FCDO (Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office), Jim will be unable to attend this ceremony too.' Fitton has been detained in Iraq for five weeks after being accused of attempting to smuggle historic artefacts out of the country. His family said Fitton collected stones and shards of broken pottery as souvenirs while visiting a site in Eridu, in the country's south-east, as part of an organised geology and archaeology tour. But they added that the items were judged to be artefacts under Iraqi law and the charge levelled at Fitton states 'whoever exported or intended to export, deliberately, an antiquity, from Iraq, shall be punishable with execution'. His case in connection with the March incident is expected to go for sentencing in the week beginning 8 May. Fitton's family described the response to the petition as 'unbelievable', adding in a statement: 'Jim really appreciates the support from old colleagues, good friends, kindred spirits, and complete strangers who have not allowed this to go unnoticed. 'We will continue to fight while we continue to have you at our backs.' Fitton worked as a geologist for oil and gas companies during his career and lives in his adopted home of Malaysia with his wife, Sarijah. Wera Hobhouse, Liberal Democrat MP for Bath, has raised his case with ministers in the House of Commons. The family said their lawyer has drafted a proposal under Iraqi law to have the case closed before trial but they need the Foreign Office to 'put their weight behind the plan and endorse it' so they can secure a high-level meeting with judicial officials in the country. The proposal cites the 'clear lack of criminality, that Jim is a victim of poor guidance and circumstance, and also cites the huge investment that the UK has made in the Iraqi governmental and judicial framework through FCDO funding in the past few years'. The family statement, via an update on the petition website, also explained: 'Leila has not seen Jim for more than two years due to Covid travel restrictions. 'We held a small Covid wedding ceremony in Bath in August of last year for close friends and our British family members, mostly on my side. 'We have, since then, been planning a larger celebration in Malaysia with all of Leila's extended family. 'This is scheduled on 8 May. Obviously there is never a good time for something like this to happen but we are one week away from what should be the happiest day of our lives, and the culmination of more than two years of planning, and it's been turned into an absolute living nightmare.' The Foreign Office said it was providing consular support and was in contact with the local authorities. Foreign Office minister Amanda Milling, in a letter to Hobhouse, said last week: 'We understand the urgency of the case, and have already raised our concerns with the Iraqi authorities regarding the possible imposition of the death penalty in Mr Fitton's case and the UK's opposition to the death penalty in all circumstances as a matter of principle.'", "a07c717ce54761966304aca8ccf43d46f693229ea217f34d9791cb89": "The market town of Tiverton, which became prosperous in the 16th and 17th centuries thanks to its thriving wool trade, is usually a tranquil kind of place. But it was an uncomfortable spot to be on Saturday as townsfolk digested the news that their MP, Neil Parish, was under investigation for allegedly watching pornography in the House of Commons. 'It's a disgrace,' said Peter Moore, 74, a retired engineer who has lived in Devon all his life ('apart from six years serving in the county regiment'). 'Of course he should resign. People used to fall on their swords but they don't now. He should resign - and Boris Johnson should resign. It's Trumpism, people don't care now. There used to be honour, there's no honour now, apart from honour among thieves.' Paul Graham, 54, a former mayor of Tiverton, heard Moore talking and couldn't resist stopping and leaping in, with a different take. 'In this country, we're innocent until proven guilty,' he said. Graham, who works in manufacturing, warmed to his theme. 'It's upsetting for the town but we don't want a byelection. I've voted for Neil three times and I'll vote for him next time if I get the chance.' He won't. By the afternoon, Parish had resigned. 'The situation was that - funnily enough it was tractors I was looking at' he told the BBC. 'I did get into another website that had a very similar name and I watched it for a bit which I shouldn't have done. But my crime - biggest crime - is that on another occasion I went in a second time.' This weekend, the story about Parish watching porn in the Commons is the latest 'off grid' disaster to hit Boris Johnson and the Tories, with just four days to go until crucial local elections. If the Conservatives do badly on Thursday many of Parish's former colleagues could be tempted to submit letters of no confidence to Sir Graham Brady calling on Johnson to go, triggering what could be the beginning of the end for the prime minister. The West Country was already looking difficult enough for Johnson as Partygate, the cost of living crisis, and other Tory sleaze scandals made his campaign claims to be just 'getting on with the job' and 'delivering for the British people' ring rather hollow. On Friday on the rural north-eastern fringes Taunton in Somerset, where desperately needed new housing is spreading around meadows, cricket fields and old cider orchards, there was little enthusiasm for the Tory offer. Kim Linden, 57, a hairdresser, said she would be switching to the Lib Dems in Thursday's local elections. '[The Tories] don't tell the truth. [Boris Johnson] said 'No we didn't have parties' but they did have parties,' she says, while being canvassed by the Lib Dems, on one of the sprawling, new-build estates. 'And it's not just that: everything is rising. Bills. Gas. Electric. Fuel. And they are not helping us. They are not putting anything in place for the future.' Other long-term Conservative voters on the private development were having doubts too. Their concerns are bad news for Johnson because the Lib Dems are eyeing a big comeback across large parts of the south-west and Tory-run Somerset county council is a key target. Dave Cardy, 52, a former police officer who now delivers prescriptions, said he had had enough of Johnson. 'I thought he would become a sensible prime minister. But he has just carried on bumbling his way through life. Really, we need a grown-up in charge - Boris's time is done,' he said. Look north, and similar views were being expressed on Friday behind the 'red wall' that Johnson and his party breached with devastating effect at the 2019 general election. Results in councils such as Kirklees, which takes in Huddersfield, will be scrutinised as Labour seeks to win back control. Across the council area views are still mixed on the Labour leader Keir Starmer's appeal and it is by no means all going his way. But there are some signs that opinion is slowly shifting in Labour's direction. A hairdresser in Birstall, who asked not to be named, said she doesn't see a way back for Johnson, because he was 'completely guilty and knew what he was doing'. She added: 'If you've lied about something then there's always going to be mistrust.' Georgina Marshall, who switched from Labour to the Conservatives at the last general election was dismayed by Johnson for very personal reasons. 'He carries on and carries on. I had a Christmas where I couldn't see my mum; I didn't see my 90-year-old grandma for two years. Meanwhile he's partying with all his friends.' Labour could retake Kirklees council by gaining just three of the 23 seats up for election, after it slipped into no overall control following three defections in 2020. But failure to do so will be seen as evidence that the red wall will be stubbornly difficult to reconquer. Millions of voters will go to the polls across the UK on Thursday, with 6,800 seats being contested, including all council seats in Scotland and Wales. In Northern Ireland the first elections to the assembly will be held since the UK's withdrawal from the EU. In England elections will take place in all London boroughs, 33 of 36 metropolitan boroughs, 60 out of 181 district councils, and 21 of 58 unitary authorities. Inevitably Labour, which did well when most of these seats were last contested in 2018, is downplaying its chances both regionally and nationally. Labour activists are pouring cold water on the idea of their party conquering the Tory strongholds of both Wandsworth and Westminster in London, while the Tories are saying Starmer's party should make huge gains at this point in the electoral cycle. Back in Tiverton, there was dismay that the quiet had been disturbed for all the wrong reasons - and a weary sense that under Johnson and his team it would never end. Katy Oakley, 40, an ecologist, was walking through the town with her four-year-old daughter, Olive. 'This sums up what everybody thinks about the government, another shocking incident in a long line. 'I think it shows just how out of touch members of the elite are with normal society. They think they can get away with things that ordinary people couldn't. 'This isn't brilliant publicity for our town - it puts Tiverton in a bad light. It's not good for the country's image abroad. And it's not good for society.' Though he lives on his farm across the border in Somerset, Parish is a well-known figure in Tiverton. He was first elected 12 years ago and since then has doubled his majority. The North Devon Tory MP, Selaine Saxby, said Parish had always been a loyal and supportive colleague. But she expressed shock: 'Nobody wants to think of their MP sat on the green benches watching videos full stop, certainly not this kind of video.' Happily for the Tories on Mid Devon district council, which is based in Tiverton, councillors are not up for election this spring. 'I guess that's a good thing,' said Ray Radford, a senior Conservative currently serving as the chairman of the council. At the indoor market, Jane Hall, 56, summed up much of the anger. 'When people are scrimping and scraping, he's sat there apparently watching porn. He should be sacked but he's got Boris as his role model. He was having a party when people were dying.'", "6568bac3f5e7ef4f0e63763adfb26d86abb36c0e6106fe8c17f7a7aa": "When police in Washington DC burst into a fifth-floor apartment building on 22 April in search of a man who allegedly had shot four people at random, they found Raymond Spencer dead by his own hand, a cache of guns and ammunition, and a poster with an ironic white supremacist meme. The poster invoking the meme, popular on the extremist online forum 4chan, was a stark reminder that this attack blamed on Spencer, 23, was only the most recent mass casualty attack to spawn out of the ugly extremist culture of unregulated internet message boards such as 4chan. That particular forum gave birth to QAnon, the far-right conspiracy theory that Donald Trump is combating a cabal of leftist pedophiles, before it moved on to its even-more-extreme cousin 8chan. QAnon has been particularly effective in crafting the lie that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Trump, inspiring the Capitol riot on 6 January 2021. A bipartisan Senate committee connected seven deaths to the attack. Alek Minassian, 25, posted an update on Facebook with a direct reference to 4chan and its extreme misogynistic community of so-called incels, short for involuntary celibates, before launching a deadly vehicle ramming rampage in Toronto in 2018. And after New Zealand police arrested Brenton Tarrant, who shot and killed 51 worshippers in mosques in Christchurch, he cited 4chan and 8chan as direct influences. Seemingly by sheer luck, Spencer's recent attack in Washington was less costly in terms of lives. But it was still a stark reminder of how many online extremists and the movements with which they sympathize can trace their origins to either 4chan or 8chan, said Oren Segal, vice-president of the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism. 'The chans - 4chan, 8chan, etc - are some of the most vile places on the internet,' Segal told the Guardian. The trolling, humor, appeals to violence: it 'seeps outside the confines of the message boards,' he added. Spencer's case has chilling aspects. He fired 200 rounds from a makeshift sniper's nest, injuring a man, two women, and a 12-year-old girl. He had an additional 800 rounds stashed. Just two minutes after the shooting began, someone under the username 'Raymond Spencer' logged onto the normally-anonymous 4chan and started a new thread titled 'shool [sic] shooting'. The newly published message contained a link - to a 30-second video of images captured from the digital scope of Spencer's rifle. The clip streamed images and sounds of the barrage of bullets which slammed into cars and shattered windows at an adjacent school while also maiming four strangers. Even as police stormed the apartment building where Spencer hid, with officers maneuvering past a surveillance camera that he had set up in the hallway and was monitoring, Spencer continued to post to the message board. 'They're in the wrong part of the building right now searching,' he posted at one point. A few minutes later: 'Waiting for police to catch up with me.' As he waited, Spencer logged on to Wikipedia to edit the entry for Edmund Burke School, which he had just opened fire on. 'A basedman shot at the school on April 22, 2022,' the edit read, using a message board term derived from the word 'based,' which is 4chan slang for somebody who agrees to the board's warped worldview. 'The suspect is still at large.' Police believe Spencer shot himself to death as officers breached his apartment. Like those who have carried out other domestic terror attacks that rocked the US, Canada and New Zealand in recent years, Spencer situated his mass shooting in a tangle of ironic memes and 4chan in-jokes. On a poster hanging in the apartment where Spencer died was a cartoon of a Black man with an enlarged head. It's a deeply ironic reference to Nation of Islam theology - which holds that a Black scientist named Yakub created the white race more than 6,000 years ago. 4chan co-opted the concept more recently, caricaturing it along the way, to justify its own white supremacist philosophy. Anti-extremist groups such as the Southern Poverty Law Center have warned for years that 4chan and 8chan would continue inspiring domestic terror attacks. Cassie Miller, a researcher at the center, analyzed a self-selected survey of users to a white supremacist webforum. She found nearly 25% reported that they considered themselves radicalized - or, in their terms, 'redpilled' - by the culture of 4chan and 8chan. It was tied for the single most-reported pathway to radicalization. While the far-right online ecosystem has grown significantly since then, the edgy humor and racist politics of 'chan' culture continue to prove influential, especially among younger users. The chans 'normalize the kinds of narratives and grievances that are dangerous', Segal said. They form a sort of 'cheering section' for violence. Even 8chan's founder, Frederick Brennan, has blamed the site for a rise in mass shootings and unsuccessfully called for it to be shut down. Brennan quit the site in 2016, leaving management to its new owners: Jim Watkins and his son Ron. The pair, who have since been identified as the likely puppet masters behind QAnon, have rejected more active moderation and have leveraged the site's extreme free speech ethos for their own political ends - Ron Watkins is currently running in a Republican congressional primary in Arizona. There are few good solutions on how to address the radicalizing influence of these forums, Segal said. Owners like Watkins have been unwilling to crack down on hate speech; whenever one web hosting company has removed them, another has stepped up; and law enforcement is simply ill-suited to monitor and investigate the deluge of hate on the platforms. It will take a 'whole-of-society approach', Segal said. 'Everything that normalizes hateful ideology ... needs to be addressed.'", "d180354f23e96c548257c670e39da281586f236605fcdb467e28f575": "Joe Biden celebrated the return of a flashy annual gathering of Washington's political and media elites on Saturday with some humorous jabs at Donald Trump - and himself. The US president, sporting a tuxedo and slightly askew bow tie, spoke at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner, which was cancelled in 2020 and 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic. It was another tentative step towards Washington norms after Trump repeatedly snubbed the gala, which champions the freedom of the press. 'This is the first time the president has attended this dinner in six years,' Biden observed. 'It's understandable. We had a horrible plague - followed by two years of Covid.' That quip produced laughter. The next one elicited both laughter and groans: 'Just imagine if my predecessor came to this dinner this year. Now that would really have been a real coup if that occurred.' The gathering included the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and other cabinet members as well as journalists such as CNN's Jake Tapper and MSNBC's Joy Reid. Celebrities including Kim Kardashian, Pete Davidson, Brooke Shields and Caitlyn Jenner walked the red carpet. The three-course dinner took place in a vast, crowded hotel ballroom despite the long shadow cast by the pandemic. Biden, 79, skipped the meal with the 2,600 guests, all of whom had to provide proof of vaccination and a same-day negative test. The event was an opportunity for the president - or more precisely his speechwriters - to flex some comedy muscles at the expense of the media, the Republican party and his own ego. He began: 'A special thanks to the 42% of you who actually applauded. I'm really excited to be here tonight with the only group of Americans with a lower approval rating than I have.' The president made fun of the hypocrisy of conservative cable channel Fox News, which has required its own employees to be vaccinated or tested daily, even as its primetime hosts rail against Biden's vaccine mandates. 'I know there are questions about whether we should gather here tonight, because of Covid. Well, we're here to show the country that we're getting through this pandemic. Plus, everyone had to prove they're fully vaccinated and boosted. So if you're home watching this, and you're wondering how to do that, just contact your favourite Fox News reporter. They're all here, vaccinated and boosted. All of them.' He also seized on recent revelations that Trump's White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Fox News's Sean Hannity exchanged more than 80 text messages between election day in 2020 and Biden's inauguration. 'Fox News, I'm really sorry your preferred candidate lost the last election. To make it up to you, I'm happy to give my chief of staff to you all so he can tell Sean Hannity what to say every day.' Perhaps the biggest laugh came when Biden made light of the 'Let's Go Brandon' slogan, which has become rightwing code for swearing at him. 'Republicans seem to support one fella, some guy named Brandon. He's having a really good year and I'm kind of happy for him.' When Biden shifted gear towards the end of his 14-minute speech to recognise the importance of journalism to American democracy, he again drew a contrast with his predecessor by insisting that a free press 'is not the enemy of the people'. 'Where the truth is buried by lies and the lies live on as truth, what's clear, and I mean this in the bottom of my heart, that you - the free press - matter more than you ever did in the last century,' Biden said. He added that 'American democracy is not a reality show' - seemingly another dig at Trump, former host of The Apprentice. In another restoration of tradition, the president was obliged to sit as he was roasted by a comedian. South African Trevor Noah, host of Comedy Central's The Daily Show, told Biden: 'Thank you for having me here. And I was a little confused on why me, but then I was told that you get your highest approval ratings when a biracial African guy is standing next to you.' Noah also observed: 'Ever since you came into office, things are already looking up. Gas is up, rent is up, food is up, everything.' The comedian took swipes at media personalities and the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis. He said of Kyrsten Sinema, a conservative Democratic senator who has helped to thwart much of Biden's legislative agenda: 'Who ever thought we'd see the day when a senator could be openly bisexual but a closeted Republican?' Noah wrapped up with a reference to Biden's botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, telling the audience: 'Please be careful leaving tonight. We all know this administration doesn't handle evacuations well.' The black tie dinner had other serious moments, with tributes to pioneer journalists of colour and aspiring student reporters. A sombre photo montage honouring journalists killed while covering the Russian invasion of Ukraine prompted a standing ovation. Chris Coons, a Democratic senator and Biden ally, told the Guardian: 'As it has always been in its best years in the past, this was an evening that was celebrating young journalists, celebrating seasoned journalists, celebrating pathbreaking journalists from a generation ago and mixed with a lot of humour, some hobnobbing, some celebrities. 'The president played exactly the role we would hope a president would: a little bit of light humour, a very serious tribute to the importance of a free press and then sitting and listening as others poked fun at him.'", "1c662ceb1e8e69d64a79783bc50a78a43f18ccf74e23c42f6f203955": "An overwhelming majority of people in the UK hold the 'woke' belief that it is important to be alive to issues of race and social justice, according to a new analysis of public attitudes. Four in five Britons believe in being attentive to those issues - the definition of 'woke' used by the Merriam-Webster dictionary - leading researchers to claim the country is not as divided by culture wars as is often assumed. An overwhelming majority of Conservative voters and those who backed Brexit also said it was important to be attentive to the issues. The report by the Global Future thinktank, using polling by YouGov, states that it is one of several areas in which there is more agreement in the UK than polarisation. It points to strong support for taking in more Ukrainian refugees (43%), including among Tory voters (30%), as well as support for wider restrictions on immigration. Only a tiny proportion of Remainers said they want totally open borders. When asked directly whether they thought they were 'woke', with no definition given, 16% said they were, 41% said they were not and 31% said they did not know what the term meant. Asked about their views on British history, 77% of people believe Britain has been a force for good in the world but that this does not equate to denying issues about the past. Some 67% also accept that Britain has done damage. A majority believe this across age, gender and region. While 74% of Conservatives acknowledge that damage has been done in Britain's past, 65% of Labour voters accept that Britain has also had a positive impact in the world. The findings have been supported by political figures attempting to stop political polarisation. 'This research reveals the decent, tolerant and ethical centre ground of the British people,' said Jon Cruddas, the Labour MP. 'We're proud of our history and we care deeply about racial and social injustice. Despite talk of polarisation, we still share a meaningful sense of the common good.' Jesse Norman, the Tory MP and former Treasury minister, said: 'What this research highlights is that, as a whole, people across the UK are both capable and comfortable in talking about complex questions of race and identity, and that they still hold firm to a centre ground of tolerance, decency and mutual respect.' The research was based on a YouGov poll conducted on 6-7 April. It polled 2,244 people online.", "422adad891eca17e08607b40fd9756d97fe0723981eebfeb43e63dc3": "", "fc71199564d3fb4b671ded1fff749314bad3ee7a533b2385a9ca7ea8": "Company directors fear the cost of living crisis and tumbling consumer confidence will cause greater harm than previously estimated, increasing the risk of an economic downturn this year, according to a major new study. The Institute of Directors (IoD) said in a survey last month that a lack of confidence in the economic outlook was 'the number one issue' facing British businesses as inflationary pressures combined with the uncertainty caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine to heighten the risk of a recession. A measure of business-leader optimism in the economy, the directors' economic confidence index fell to -36 in April from -4 in February. City analysts and economists have become increasingly concerned that the UK's rebound from the pandemic is quickly running out of steam following steep rises in the price of gas, electricity, petrol and food. Shortages of staff across industries such as IT, manufacturing, construction and hospitality are also forcing employers to pay signing-on fees, bonuses and higher wages to secure employees with the necessary skills. The Bank of England is expected to increase interest rates this week in response to a jump in inflation to 7% in March, adding further pressure on indebted businesses and households that rely on credit to make ends meet. Officials at the central bank will publish their latest forecasts for the economy, which are likely to show it contracting in the second quarter in response to a decline in household spending power. A separate study by the consultants EY-Parthenon revealed the number of profit warnings issued by UK-listed companies soared by 44% year on year in the first quarter of 2022, with a record number of firms citing rising costs for the weaker performance. The report found that UK-listed companies issued 72 warnings in the first three months of 2022 - the highest quarterly figure since the start of the pandemic. A record-breaking 43% of warnings was due to rising costs, up from 27% in Q4 2021 and well above the 2011-21 average of 10%. Alan Hudson, a partner at the firm, said: 'Inflationary pressures, which had been building throughout 2021, were already putting pressure on company margins and consumers' real incomes. 'The war in Ukraine has contributed to greater supply-side pressures and raised questions about confidence and demand in 2022. We are now looking at a year with ongoing Covid-19 disruption alongside higher inflation, greater uncertainty and faster monetary tightening than we expected just a few months ago.' Kitty Ussher, chief economist at the IoD, said the invasion of Ukraine had 'sent shock waves around British boardrooms'. She said some businesses were beginning to plan and consider new investments, but 'optimism in the UK economy itself remains very low and is now the number one issue seen as having a negative impact on businesses, even above the other very real pressures of high energy costs, difficulties in the labour market and problems with international supply chains'.", "c07c517c7cabf009f5026a8f0c33ca977d0b8465192f9dabff2b433b": "", "a023be7abf31b81d8509eda4819eb830d16d138515d21fad476ea191": "", "207a1af1fb839a8bda395cdd8156494c4d328df5d55e09da5839cac5": "", "c1843dbeaf02a1913b6c34c3063098bdbefd6a739d8c34134704c92a": "", "b53e8b6c0b28be2daf68d90c51fe59702ac22114bd15e201e9150eb1": "", "1ed0f3ee04916bb7af5afa4a54c168e63e7c0f771d96f6c6a5b3889b": "", "d6a0f3fc13cc0dc0d7e83e7917c644c64b147809594a11ed59d41fe3": "", "cd25f5caeda9e3d3aa33f0b5aa3941833c7b65bab38213526efcf976": "Even through the haze of shimmering heat and thick Delhi dust, the mural is impossible to miss. Pinks, blues, greens and yellows pop off the wall, coming together to form a utopian scene of equality, and splashed across the middle is emblazoned a slogan designed to challenge India's male-dominated society. 'The future is femme,' it declares. The artwork stands at the entrance of this year's India art fair, the country's largest event showcasing Indian artists and galleries, which opens in Delhi this weekend after a two-year hiatus due to the pandemic. Its presence is significant. Aravani art collective, the artists behind the work, have never showcased in a major gallery, nor do they see themselves as a part of the money-driven art market, which exists mainly within the confines of white gallery walls. Aravani are India's only trans art collective, encompassing about 40 trans people - mainly women but some men - from cities across the country, who paint murals and artworks across public spaces. Metro stations, schools, universities, flyovers and carparks have been transformed by their artworks depicting scenes of inclusion and gender fluidity. The murals have brought visibility and empowerment to the trans community, who are still largely shunned and stigmatised in India and often forced to live on the fringes of society. 'In this mural we wanted to celebrate the intersectionality and inclusivity that has always existed within the trans community but is rarely visible in our society,' said Poornima Sukumar, who founded the collective in 2016. The decision to take part in the art fair was not an entirely comfortable one, said Sukumar, but one that she hoped would help shift perceptions and give them a platform to depict the multi-faceted nature of their collective and the trans community at large. 'It's important in our work to challenge that perception that everyone in the trans community is the same,' she said. 'Yes many have run away from home because of the pressures and have ended up doing begging or sex work because that was the only viable source of money, but within those experiences there are so many individual journeys.' For Mayuri Pujari, who has been part of the collective since 2017, the impact of her involvement has been profound. 'The visibility is empowering,' she said. 'People see the trans community as professionals making art, not just begging on the roads.' Among the new generation of young artists being showcased at this year's fair, which plays a pivotal role in India's flourishing art market, many have used their works to push boundaries around sexuality, gender and queer stories. In a specially commissioned performance piece for example, Gurjeet Singh, a celebrated young Sikh artist from a small village on the border with Pakistan, delicately questions and inverts traditional gender roles in families and in the home. For Jaya Asokan, director of the fair, the 'diversity and inclusion' widening India's art landscape, as well as growing international interest in the Indian art market, meant the fair was taking place at 'a turning point for Indian and south Asia art.' 'A lot of our artists have had regional appeal for a while but the narrative is shifting and now they are in demand internationally,' said Asokan. Certainly from a commercial side, things have never looked so good for the Indian modern art market. The pandemic provided an unexpected boost to sales and over the past two years; there whave been at least three record-setting sales of modern Indian art, including Amrita Sher-Gil's 1938 painting In the Ladies' Enclosure for $5.14m, the second-highest amount ever paid for a modern Indian artwork. 'I haven't seen a market as strong as this one since 2006, which lasted for a few years before the financial crisis,' said Dinesh Vazirani, the chief executive of Indian art auction house Saffronart. He credited the boom to a multitude of factors, including lockdowns giving people a greater desire for beautiful objects in their homes and growing income among people in the world of Indian tech and pharmaceuticals, with newly minted businessmen and entrepreneurs wanting to invest in art as something 'aspirational'. 'We are seeing a whole new type of collector, young people in their 30s and 40s, entering the Indian market with a completely new mindset,' said Vazirani. 'Art now has a societal standing and there's almost a social pressure to buy art and buy the best. So people who were entering the market at $100,000 are now willing to go up to half a million. At every auction we have seen records broken, one after the other.' Yet the shifts within the market are not solely within the sphere of Indian modern and contemporary art. For the first time, this year's art fair is showcasing rare items of Indian folk art, some dating back 100 years, illustrating changing perceptions towards older indigenous art within the Indian market, which has always been focused on the modern and contemporary. Among the works on show are a series of bronze mukhalingam sculptures, a representation of the Hindu god Shiva, which have never been seen in public before. 'Our folk culture has been much more popular overseas in the last four decades than it has on the Indian domestic market,' said Amit Jain, who curated the folk art booths at this year's fair. 'I'm used to this art and these artists being seen as on the peripheries so it's amazing to see India's full history brought into this contemporary space. It's high time that museums in India look at art laterally and not compartmentalised into modern and folk.' The fair will also address the darker side of the Indian art market, particularly when it comes to antiquities. Collectors and viewers have been invited to a tour of a Museum of Confiscated Antiquities in Purana Quila, an old fort in Delhi, where the objects on show will be those recently returned to India after being stolen and sold to wealthy collectors or displayed in the world's famed galleries. The museum features items reclaimed from high-profile looters now in jail but also institutions such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. 'India is one of the biggest victims of illicit trafficking of antiquities, it's a black market that's as big as drugs and ammunitions and we still have a lot of looting going on,' said Anica Mann, the curator of the young collectors programme at the fair who has curated and will lead the tour. 'Antiquities are a very important cog in the entire roster of south Asian art so it's about time we talked about ethical collecting.'", "a4b65e4dc4b36e8592c1e542be0f1aa963a266cc74cd7b0f8464f744": "Four years after Republicans embraced Donald Trump's nativist and often racist playbook in an attempt to keep control of Congress, the party is once again placing the volatile politics of immigration at the center of its midterm election strategy. From the US-Mexico border to the US Capitol, in hearing rooms and courtrooms, Republicans are hammering the issue. At the forefront of the debate is a once-obscure public health order invoked by the Trump administration in March 2020 ostensibly as a means for controlling the spread of the coronavirus along the south-western border. Seizing on a decision by the Biden administration to lift such 'Title 42' border restrictions, Republicans have sought to paint Democrats as pursuing an extremist immigration agenda that they say has cost the nation its very sovereignty. The provocative and often misleading messaging campaign was on full display when Alejandro Mayorkas, the secretary of homeland security, testified on Capitol Hill. For more than eight hours, across two days, Republicans pelted Mayorkas with accusations and insults, demanding he accept the blame for what they described as dangerous and dire conditions along the 2,000-mile border with Mexico. 'We're all really border states now,' Congressman Steve Chabot of Ohio said darkly. In another tense exchange, Ken Buck of Colorado said his constituents believed Mayorkas was guilty of treason and deserved to be impeached - something conservatives have vowed to pursue if they win the House. 'What you have just said - it is so profoundly offensive on so many different levels, in so many different regards,' Mayorkas responded, visibly upset.  Mayorkas forcefully defended the administration's handling of the border and said it was up to Congress to act. 'We inherited a broken and dismantled system that is already under strain,' Mayorkas said. 'It is not built to manage the current levels and types of migratory flows. Only Congress can fix this.' The hearings laid bare the tensions within Democratic ranks over Biden's immigration actions, particularly over Title 42. For months, immigration advocates and progressives have been pressuring Biden to lift Title 42, which gives officials the authority to swiftly expel migrants trying to enter the US instead of allowing them to seek asylum and remain in the country while their claim is evaluated. 'You're essentially doing policymaking by crisis,' said Claudia Flores, an immigration policy expert at the left-leaning Center for American Progress thinktank. 'And that's just not effective.' As a matter of public policy, Flores said, it was dangerous to use a public health order to control immigration. Not only was the rule insufficient for addressing problems at the border, she added, but it had carried 'grave humanitarian consequences' for asylum seekers. But some vulnerable Democrats have appealed to Biden to hold off on lifting the order, fearing it could be a political liability ahead of a difficult election cycle. Agreeing with Republicans, they have expressed concern that the administration lacks a comprehensive plan for dealing with the anticipated increase in migrants making asylum claims when the order is lifted in late May. 'This is not good for Democrats in November,' the Texas congressman Henry Cuellar, a Democrat facing a progressive challenge for his border-district seat, told Fox News Digital. 'You know, in talking with some of my Republican colleagues, they're saying, 'We can't believe the White House is giving us this narrative. We can't believe that they're hurting Democrat candidates for the November election.'' In his testimony, Mayorkas argued that his department had a plan to handle the expected surge of migrants. He repeatedly directed lawmakers to a six-point plan, released in advance of the hearings, that outlined a more aggressive effort to enforce immigration laws after the public health rule is lifted. It also included efforts to partner with non-profits that help migrants in the US while their cases are processed and to work with countries across the region to address 'root causes' of migration. 'When the Title 42 public health order is lifted, we anticipate migration levels will increase, as smugglers will seek to take advantage of and profit from vulnerable migrants,' the memo stated. It did little to appease Republicans and some Democrats. 'It's clear to me that the federal government is not prepared - not even close,' Greg Stanton of Arizona, a border-state Democrat, said during the hearing. Biden has worked to reverse many hardline policies that were at the heart of Trump's 'zero tolerance' approach to immigration. The number of migrants attempting to cross the border has risen sharply. Biden has argued that the only way to address the migration is at the source - an ambitious plan that will probably take years to bear fruit. In the short term, his administration faces acute operational and political challenges. At a White House meeting last week, members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus urged the president to stand firm behind the decision to end the public health order. 'Title 42 must end on 23 May,' the California congresswoman Nanette Barragan, a deputy chair of the CHC, said she told the president, while urging him to 'not support legislation to extend the end-date'. With the prospects of legislative action dim ahead of the midterms, the caucus is urging Biden to use his executive authority to make good on some of his promises to Latino voters on immigration, the environment, healthcare and the economy. They have argued that it is both good policy and good politics, as Latino support for Democrats is waning amid concern over the economy and inflation. 'After four years of traumatic, xenophobic and inhumane immigration policies being forced on our most vulnerable communities, we have a duty to deliver them the protection and support they and their families so desperately need,' the Democratic congressman Adriano Espaillat, of New York, said after the meeting. Fears over Title 42 are only one element of the Republicans' messaging. Republicans have sought to tie illegal immigration to other potent themes like voter fraud and crime. Allegations of undocumented migrants voting in large numbers have been repeatedly disproved. Studies have found that migrants commit crime at lower rates than native-born citizens. Republicans have long used immigration as a political weapon - with mixed results. In 2018, they lost the House in a wave election fueled in part by fury over Trump's hardline policies that separated migrant children from their parents. The same year they expanded control in the Senate. The political winds have reversed. Republicans are heavily favored to take the House, and possibly the Senate. The national mood has soured on Biden and the Democrats as concerns over the economy and inflation deepen. But even as economic discontent dominates political debate, polling suggests immigration remains a pressing issue, particularly for Republicans. Four in 10 Americans, and nearly 70% of Republicans, say they worry a 'great deal' about illegal immigration, according to a Gallup survey. During a tour of the border in Texas last week, the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, chided a reporter for asking about his false claim that he never urged Trump to resign after the January 6 insurrection - comments captured by an audio recording. 'After all this, that's what you want to ask?' he said. 'I don't think that's what the American people are asking. I think they want to know about what's going to happen here and how we're going to secure the border.' Democrats blame Republicans for whipping up fear while standing in the way of reform. It has been almost a decade since Congress seriously considered immigration reform, a bipartisan plan that was derailed by House conservatives. 'Let me tell you why our Republican colleagues don't want to do their job - why they won't work with us or vote for any of the bills that we have brought forward in the House,' the Texas congresswoman Veronica Escobar said. 'It's because the status quo works for them.' 'They love Title 42,' she said, arguing that it 'helps them push this xenophobic rage machine that they believe will help them get elected and re-elected'. It is unclear how the administration plans to proceed if a court rules it cannot lift Title 42. Biden declined to say whether he would sign legislation delaying the removal, which is under consideration by a bipartisan group in Congress. Vanessa Cardenas, deputy director of America's Voice, a pro-immigration group, said Democrats must be more aggressive in defending their vision for reform. Keeping Title 42, she said, would not only play into Republicans' hands, but would be a major disappointment to voters, particularly Latino voters who helped Democrats win in 2018 and 2020. 'In an election season where margins matter, in states like Arizona, Nevada and Georgia, where the presence and the vote of the Latino community can make a difference, it's really important that Democrats are able to articulate a vision that is in contrast to the other side,' Cardenas said. Referring to Trump's hardline adviser, she added: 'A Stephen Miller-Lite approach to immigration is not going to motivate the base.'", "d6513bf0ced70f56327707b610b35a87741cf9e6e6ee43183c437d52": "Hot, dry winds will continue to spur flames burning through the drought-stricken landscapes in the south-west and the American plains, complicating efforts to extinguish roughly a dozen destructive wildfires that have already driven thousands from their homes. Risks are usually higher in the region during this time of year and fire conditions typically ramp up in the months sandwiched between winter and summer rain seasons. But experts say the explosive start is an indication of what's to come in the warming months. Spiking temperatures threaten to bake more moisture out of the thirsty environments, setting the stage for ignitions to turn into infernos. 'Climate change is taking a situation that would be bad for us normally,' says Gregg Garffin, a climatologist at the University of Arizona, 'and turning the dial up.' Once confined to specific times of year, wildfire conditions are stretching across more months, and will likely continue until the region gets additional rain. More than a million acres have already burned across the country since the start of this year, an amount more than double last year for this date, according to the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC). The agency's accounting also shows that more fires have ignited this year than any other in the last decade and burn totals are more than 71% higher than the ten-year average. Last year's exceptionally strong summer monsoon in the south-west - which delivered record rainfall in some areas - led to a lush landscape that has now begun to brown. With temperatures rising, the parched plants have turned to fuel for flames, driven faster by gusty winds. The conditions aren't expected to abate anytime soon. Roughly 90% of the American west remains mired in drought with many areas desperately missing the winter rains they rely on to refill water-starved systems. 'You have this desiccation going on due to climate change and you combine that with other factors,' Garffin said, noting the La Nina pattern that delivered less winter rains across areas of the west, 'and it is really a year-round fire season.' La Nina is a climate system that develops in the Pacific ocean and delivers more dry days across the southern third of the US. Its drought-producing effects are especially pronounced in the south-west. The conditions have been particularly problematic in New Mexico, where five large fires have already burned more than 157,603 acres. The Southwest Coordination Center, the region's hub for a national coordination system that organizes information and mobilizes resources between federal and state dispatch centers, has bumped its preparedness level to four - the second highest category - noting the rising strain on local resources. 'That is like the bat signal saying, 'hey we need help over here,'' says Candice Stevenson a public information officer at the NIFC, noting that the area may need more national resources in the south-west. The National level is currently at 2 and there are more teams available to deploy. With months left before its fire season typically peaks in June, more acres have already burned in New Mexico than in seven of the last eight years. 'We have been busier than we have in the past with fire activity,' says Scott Overpeck, warning coordination meteorologist for the National Weather Service based in Albuquerque, comparing the start of the season to other bad drought years in 2011 and 2018. 'We have been seeing the writing on the wall, in the sense that we know with the drought conditions that it is going to be a rough season.' April is also the state's windiest month which has spurred the spread. With no rain in the forecast, the state is bracing for strong gusts expected through next week. 'It is going to depend on when these storm systems come across and increase the winds that are really going to make trouble for us,' Overpeck says. Despite the harrowing conditions, firefighters made progress on the state's largest blaze, the The Calf canyon and Hermits peak fire. The fire, which had already consumed more than 63,720 acres on Friday, was 37% contained. A red flag warning remained in effect, with wind gusts of up to 50 mph, poor relative humidity, and rising temperatures threatening to test containment lines into the weekend. Roughly 960 firefighters and other personnel battling the blaze are prioritizing the safety of structures, but hundreds of homes have already been lost and nearly 300 buildings total have been damaged or destroyed, according to New Mexico fire officials. Conditions are not likely to improve in the coming days or weeks. 'We have a very large area from north-east New Mexico up into Colorado and western Kansas and we have designated it an extremely critical fire weather risk area,' says Bill Bunting, the chief of forecast operations at the Noaa/NWS Storm Prediction Center, noting that the dangerous combination of strong winds, low relative humidity, and dryness fuels 'the rapid spread and erratic behavior of any fire that gets started'. Bunting added that this will make it 'exceedingly difficult' to fight the fires already burning. There have already been a number of high-end fire weather danger days this year, according to Bunting and the threats are expected to persist. The NIFC has predicted an above-normal fire potential lasting through the spring in areas from the high plains through the south-west. The threats will also linger farther west, into central Oregon and northern California this spring, and will only grow there through the summer and autumn. With the snowpack waning, the agency also noted that historic water sources used for suppression might not be available. 'There will be wetting rains in some areas but overall, it does suggest that it is going to be an active fire season,' Bunting says. 'It is just a reminder - you can have dangerous fire conditions any time of the year.'", "55711915ecc152475c3c0d87983bee8af818b4f5b8a8644393c99b91": "When you think about Tennessee, you're more likely to be thinking country music, barbecue and bourbon than crypto, blockchain and Web3. The state legislature has plans to change that. Tennessee just passed a bill that could help it become a leader in states providing a home to entrepreneurs who want to set up a unique kind of company that uses the blockchain to automate its decision-making. It's called a DAO. More of that in a moment. First, a few definitions. The 'blockchain' is a distributed database that is shared among the nodes of a computer network and stores its information in a digital format and in such a way that changes can be made only once approvals from multiple parties are made in 'the chain'. The blockchain is the foundation for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum, which use the unique identifiers of the blockchain to create their value. It's all part of the new, distributed iteration of the internet, called web 3.0 or Web3. DAOs are another thing that's grown from all of this: A DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization, is formed on the blockchain by multiple parties and, like other blockchain transactions, requires all decisions to be authorized by those members before actions can be taken. One example of a DAO is BeetsDAO, a company that aims to support projects in music, gaming and art. The organization pooled its members' funds but, because it's a DAO, no purchases can be made unless all the members democratically approve its transactions. A DAO has no leader. All of its moves are collective - and usually automated - driven by 'smart' contracts that follow previously agreed-upon rules and are powered on the blockchain. Rules cannot be edited without people noticing - it's transparent and public. 'The dream,' BeetsDAO founder Jordan Garbis said during a panel discussion last year, is to 'create networks of communities that actually drive the value of artists.' Garbis' company made a name for itself by plunking down $250,000 for a digital piece created by Snoop Dogg and Nyan Cat. Many other companies in the Web3 world have formed themselves as DAOs because they feel it's a better and more equitable way to do business. Now you may ask: what does all this have to do with Tennessee? As mentioned above, earlier this month the Tennessee state legislature unanimously passed a new bill that formally recognizes the registration of DAOs. Believe it or not, the only state to do this so far is Wyoming. Why do these states, which aren't usually considered hot tech spots, care about this? It's simple: jobs. 'With this new business structure, Tennessee will a beacon for blockchain investment and new jobs,' state representative Jason Powell told the Nashville Scene. 'Just as Delaware became a hub for traditional LLCs or South Dakota for credit card companies.' So will crypto entrepreneurs be flocking to Tennessee to start up their DAOs? Powell - and many other of the state's legislators - certainly hope so. And they have cause for optimism. 'Nashville is quickly becoming a hotbed for Web3 companies,' Mike Audi, a tech company founder and one of the first to become a legal DAO in the state told Decrypt, a news site that follows Web3 developments. 'With supportive legislation expect to see more of it. Founders will flock here, build here and stay here.' DAOs represent a new type of corporate structure based on a new type of business model. The blockchain is creating countless entrepreneurs making money from digital products and digital currencies. Some governments have been slow to recognize the significance of this growing trend. But others - even from unlikely places like Tennessee - get it. And they're adapting their laws to make it easy for tomorrow's crypto entrepreneurs to succeed. That kind of forward thinking can only benefit the taxpayers they represent in the years to come.

'Russia hopes to rectify issues that have previously constrained its invasion by geographically concentrating combat power, shortening supply lines and simplifying command and control,' a British military intelligence report released early on Saturday said. 'It has been forced to merge and redeploy depleted and disparate units from the failed advances in north-east Ukraine. Many of these units are likely suffering from weakened morale.' After Moscow's withdrawal from the areas north of Kyiv early in April, which revealed the brutality of mass graves, with hundreds of civilian corpses buried in residential districts, about two weeks ago the long-anticipated large-scale military operation in the Donbas and second phase of the war began, with Russian forces carrying out one of the biggest barrages of missile strikes since the beginning of the invasion. According to figures reported by the Russian news agency Interfax, Moscow's artillery units hit 389 Ukrainian targets overnight, including 35 control points, 15 arms and ammunition depots, and several areas where Ukrainian troops and equipment were concentrated. The statement added that Russian missiles also struck four ammunition and fuel depots. The report has not yet been independently verified. However, while acknowledging its own heavy losses from Russia's attacks in the east, Kyiv has claimed to have inflicted 'colossal' Russian losses during Moscow's effort to fully capture the eastern Donbas region. 'We have serious losses, but the Russians' losses are much, much bigger ... They have colossal losses,' said a Ukrainian presidential adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych. The English-language newspaper Kyiv Independent tweeted a graphic showing a tally of Russia's combat losses caused by Ukraine's armed forces, using data from the Ukraine military. According to the indicative estimates, as of 30 April, 23,200 Russian soldiers have been killed since the beginning of the invasion. Losses include the destruction of 190 Russian planes, more than 1,000 tanks, eight naval vessels, about 1,700 small vehicles, almost 2,500 armoured personnel carriers and 436 artillery systems. Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv, was hit by more deadly shelling on Saturday while Ukrainian forces made some gains in the surrounding region. Although Ukraine has retained control of Kharkiv, the city has been repeatedly battered by Moscow's forces and still faces daily attacks. One person was killed and five injured in artillery and mortar strikes, Kharkiv's regional military administration said on the Telegram app. 'The situation in the Kharkiv region is tough. But our military, our intelligence, have important tactical success,' the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in his latest televised address. Ukrainian forces said they had recaptured the village of Ruska Lozova, near Kharkiv, which had been occupied by Russian troops for two months, and evacuated hundreds of civilians. The Pentagon spokesperson, John Kirby, on Friday briefly choked with emotion as he described the destruction in Ukraine and denounced Putin's 'depravity'. Ukrainian prosecutors say they have pinpointed more than 8,000 war crimes carried out by Russian troops and are investigating 10 Russian soldiers for suspected atrocities in Bucha near Kyiv. It has been a month since the Ukrainian army pushed Russian forces out of the Kyiv region, yet local police and volunteers are still finding new graves. More than 1,000 bodies have been recovered there, according to Ukrainian prosecutors, who said many more people were killed by bombs, making their remains hard to find. Ukrainian police on Saturday reported finding three bodies with their hands tied behind their backs as Russia continued shelling the east. The bodies were found on Friday in a pit near Bucha, a town close to Kyiv that has become synonymous with allegations of Russian war crimes.  Moscow on Friday confirmed it carried out an airstrike on Kyiv during a visit by the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres. Zelenskiy called for a stronger global response after the strike, saying that 'a deliberate and brutal humiliation of the United Nations by Russia has gone unanswered'. Guterres had also toured Bucha and other Kyiv suburbs where Moscow is alleged to have committed war crimes. Guterres tweeted on Friday: 'I was moved by the resilience and bravery of the people of Ukraine. My message to them is simple: We will not give up.' He added: 'The UN will redouble its efforts to save lives and reduce human suffering. In this war, as in all wars, the civilians always pay the highest price.' Reuters, Agence France-Presse and Associated Press contributed to this report", "fa5b1135125c049cf32fb04ad6d0e6ac876b093776df5c7655f167ae": "Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, is unlikely to have given up his ambitions to seize Kyiv after losing the battle for the city this spring, Britain's ambassador to Ukraine warned as she returned to work in the wartime capital. Melinda Simmons, who has moved back to Kyiv despite Russian threats against diplomats based there, said it was 'overwhelming' to be back in a city that she once feared she might not see again. 'I wasn't sure I'd make it back to Kyiv, so coming back is an extraordinary thing,' she said in her first interview from the capital since evacuating the embassy in February. 'It absolutely feels like the right place to be.' Simmons drove into the city from western Ukraine late on Friday, a journey along a highway battered by some of the most brutal Russian assaults. The charred remnants of destroyed buildings that line miles of highway are testament to the intensity of the fighting. 'It's helpful to drive because you get a real sense of what was going on ... and it's truly shocking. But what is equally extraordinary is to see how Ukraine kept Russia out of Kyiv. Every way in which Ukraine has been able to do that is a thing to to celebrate and to treasure.' Moscow has shifted its focus to a new offensive in the east and south after retreating from Kyiv, at least for now. 'I think Putin would certainly want to give it another try if he thought he was making progress,' Simmons said. But even in the east, after concentrating their forces for a new offensive, Russian's military has struggled. It is appearing to repeat some of the tactical mistakes it made around the capital and is bearing heavy losses on the frontline. Around the city of Kharkiv, Ukrainian forces made some gains against Russia, despite heavy shelling that killed one and injured five. The Pentagon spokesperson, John Kirby, on Friday briefly choked with emotion as he described the destruction in Ukraine and denounced Putin's 'depravity'. Ukrainian prosecutors say they have pinpointed more than 8,000 war crimes by Russian troops and are investigating 10 Russian soldiers for suspected atrocities in Bucha near Kyiv. It has been a month since the Ukrainian army pushed Russia out of the Kyiv region, yet police and volunteers are still finding new graves. The gradual return of many western ambassadors to Kyiv has served as a show of confidence and solidarity for the government of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who on Friday welcomed Simmons back by name in his video address to the nation. Perhaps for that reason, Russia has threatened to target foreign diplomats in the capital, which it hit with missile strikes that killed a journalist during a visit by the UN secretary general Antonio Guterreslast week. 'I'm not minimising it. I'm not discounting it. You have to take it into account, but I'm still here,' Simmons said, pointing out that she was not a lone potential target. '[There are 27 ambassadors here] so that's quite a lot of diplomats to target,' she said. 'I am here with a heightened level of security protection and bearing in mind that potential risk, but for now I feel comfortable working under those circumstances.' She said that despite strong Ukrainian resistance, and Russia's failings, the war is not likely to end soon. 'You are looking at quite a long game ... certainly through this year and probably through next year', and effectively warned that Kyiv will not be safe until Russia has been defeated. 'Politically, I don't doubt that Putin's objectives for Ukraine have not changed, even though their tanks had to withdraw back to the north from Kyiv,' she said. 'I can also see that the Kyiv city administration and the Ukraine armed forces are not taking that gain for granted at all. And they're right.' Asked whether the UK thought Ukraine should try to push the struggling Russian military out of the country altogether, and reclaim Crimea, she said the first military focus should be reclaiming territory seized since the invasion began. 'The most important thing right now is to push Russia back to where they were before February ... because that's where the existential threat lies. Let's get to that stage. And then let's see,' she said. But she added that the UK 'has never recognised the illegal annexation of Crimea', or the separatist claims on the Donbas region, and that those land grabs now have 'an awful lot more profile than they did before the invasion. It's focused an awful lot more people's attention on it. So let's see how that translates itself.' The British government is in touch with families of two aid workers who have been detained by Russian forces, but continues to advise citizens not to travel to Ukraine for any reason, she said. A British citizen was killed fighting for Ukraine last week. 'That has to be (an individual) choice, but our advice is really clear. That nobody should be doing this because it's not safe,' she said.", "0dde5ee6722e9685e1f2cf0d23a6ee8c4b592ca9abfe3945c25690cf": "Russian internet trolls based in an old arms factory in St Petersburg are targeting world leaders online and spreading support for Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, the British government has said, citing research. Online operatives were found to be ordering followers to target western media outlets and politicians, according to research funded by the UK government, which plans to share it with major online platforms and other governments. The troll factory is suspected to be linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin, the founder of the Internet Research Agency accused of meddling in the 2016 election that saw Donald Trump win the presidency. The headquarters is allegedly located in rented space in St Petersburg's Arsenal Machine-building Factory, a company that manufactures military equipment and technology. The study details how the Russian president's regime is trying to manipulate public opinion on social media, as well as in the comments sections of major media outlets. Targets include the social media accounts of Boris Johnson, the British prime minister; the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz; and the EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell. The research said TikTok influencers were being paid to amplify pro-Kremlin narratives. Operatives also amplified genuine messages by legitimate social media users that happen to be consistent with the Kremlin's viewpoint - seemingly to evade social media platforms' measures to combat disinformation. The analysis suggests one main activity is 'brigading', to steer attention of discussion on social media and in comments sections of newspapers towards favoured opinions. Manipulation of polls in western media was also observed, including to skew the results of a survey on whether sanctions against Russia were supported. Activities on Twitter and Facebook were detected, but were found to be particularly concentrated on Instagram, YouTube and TikTok. A key role in the network is said to be performed by a Telegram channel called 'Cyber Front Z', with the letter Z signifying Russian support for the war. Social media accounts of bands and musicians including Daft Punk, David Guetta, Tiesto and Rammstein appear to have been targeted by the disinformation operation. Researchers say the group seems to have learned from the tactics used by QAnon conspiracy theorists and from the Islamic State terror group. The troll farm is said to recruit and hire salaried workers openly, justifying the work as 'patriotic activity' in support of the 'special military operation' in Ukraine. The British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said: 'We cannot allow the Kremlin and its shady troll farms to invade our online spaces with their lies about Putin's illegal war. 'The UK government has alerted international partners and will continue to work closely with allies and media platforms to undermine Russian information operations.' The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, said: 'These are insidious attempts by Putin and his propaganda machine to deceive the world about the brutality he's inflicting on the people of Ukraine. 'This evidence will help us to more effectively identify and remove Russian disinformation and follows our decisive action to block anyone from doing business with Kremlin-controlled outlets RT and Sputnik.' The Foreign Office was not identifying the researchers behind the work amid concerns over their safety for conducting work critical of the Russian president's regime. With the Press Association", "17e9374989923dc69fbac895a167912e91283212fedb93600cb62956": "When it became clear to Liliia Fomina that the war raging outside her hometown of Zaporizhzhia would continue not just for days, but months or even years, she decided that she wanted to flee to the UK. A sponsor in Windsor was found, and on 18 March the 29-year-old applied for a British visa for herself and her five-year-old son Lev. The pair sheltered with friends of friends in a village near Chernivtsi, in western Ukraine, and waited: one week, two weeks, three weeks. By the time her visa finally came through, after almost a month of uncertainty, the lawyer had changed her mind. Instead of boarding a flight to Britain, Fomina and Lev travelled by coach and train to Berlin, where she had found a family via a Facebook group who had agreed to house them for six months. The journey took 32 hours. Less than 12 hours after arriving in the German capital last Monday night, she had obtained a provisional residence permit, got hold of a free sim card for her phone, opened a bank account, and found a free place at a church-run nursery for Lev, who is named after the Russian writer Tolstoy. By the end of the week, Fomina had also obtained German health insurance and been handed the first instalment of a monthly benefits payment of EUR616 (PS516) for her and her son, as well as a one-off EUR294 payment to buy new clothes, all in cash. 'The word of mouth on Ukrainian Telegram [social media] groups was that it would be much easier to integrate into German than British society,' Fomina told the Observer. 'Our British sponsors seemed very friendly and willing to help, but there was very little available information about the benefits system or how easy it would be to find work. 'After four days in Berlin, I'm 100% sure I made the right decision.' Seven years ago, Germany's 'refugee crisis' caught the attention of the world, when Angela Merkel's government opened its borders to an influx of asylum seekers, most of them fleeing the war in Syria, triggering a rightwing backlash that saw the far-right Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD) enter parliament for the first time. In the first two months of Russia's aggression, 390,000 Ukrainians have arrived in Germany, more than twice the number of Syrians who were registered with Germany's quota system in September and October 2015. Yet this time the word 'crisis' is nowhere to be heard. Vladimir Putin's war of aggression in Ukraine has seen Germany's government dithering over shipments of arms and an embargo on Russian energy imports, to the frustration of its European allies. Chancellor Olaf Scholz has at times looked more concerned with respecting the doveish traditions of his centre-left party and heeding the pleas of German industry than addressing a rapidly changing geopolitical situation. But in its dealings with an unprecedented influx of newcomers from Ukraine, Europe's largest economy has been uncharacteristically unbureaucratic, drama-free and outward-looking. The number of arrivals in Germany is dwarfed by those in countries directly on Ukraine's borders - especially Poland, where more people have found a shelter from the war than in all other European countries combined. Yet in Liliia Fomina's Telegram groups there are many Ukrainians in Poland voicing concerns they could get trapped in poorly paid menial jobs, and the expectation is that many of her compatriots will make use of the EU's 90-day visa waiver to move further west. Going by national governments' official numbers, Germany is their most likely destination: more Ukrainians (almost 400,000) are already here than in other large European states such as France (51,000), Italy, (about 100,000) and Spain (135,000). Britain, outside the EU and with a slow-moving visa system in place, has taken in only about 27,000, although 86,000 visas have been granted. Unlike the Syrians who arrived in 2015, Ukrainians in Germany do not have to apply for asylum but can obtain a quick residence permit valid for up to three years, thanks to the previously unused paragraph 24 of the German residence act. Unless they opt for Berlin, which relocates those who haven't found accommodation for at least six months before they arrive to other parts of the country, they are free to choose where to live, and can start working almost immediately. Those in non-regulated professions such as the care sector are likely to have their qualifications recognised without having to prove them in an exam. The overhauled system has helped people like Alina Shchukina, 35, who left Kharkiv with her eight-year-old son amid heavy shelling on 3 March. Within two weeks of arriving in Berlin, her host family had helped her get an interview to be a legal assistant a corporate law firm. The job offer arrived on the same day. 'I was genuinely surprised because everything happened so quickly,' she said. 'Germany makes it very easy for Ukrainians to get benefits. But I couldn't have sat around waiting for the war to end. I am not that kind of person.' Activists who have spent years campaigning for a reform of Germany's immigration and asylum laws are delighted. 'Instead of looking at these refugees only as victims who are expected to return to their homeland as soon as they can, there's a genuine effort to integrate them into the labour market,' said Katarina Niewiedzial, Berlin senate's integration officer. 'I dare not say it, but I think we're witnessing a paradigm change.' The change is especially surprising because immigration authorities appeared to have been caught by surprise by the outbreak of a war that had been threatened for months. When thousands of Ukrainian refugees started arriving at Berlin central station in early March, volunteers complained they had been left to shoulder the burden. Andreas Ahrens, a pensioner from Hamburg, opened up his late father's home in the northern German city's outskirts to a group of Ukrainians in mid-March. 'We didn't have to think about it for long: it was a decision we made within a few minutes,' he said. 'Syria and Afghanistan, those places feel very far away, but Ukraine is right on our doorstep.' For other Germans, religion, ethnicity and gender may also have been factors making them more willing to share their living space with refugees than in 2015. Seven years ago, two-thirds of asylum applicants in Germany were male, even though the gender balance among Syrian refugees in Germany has recently tipped the other way. Of the newly arrived adult Ukrainians who are receiving benefits in Germany this year, 83% are female. For the last two years of his life, Ahrens's father had lived in the four-storey house on his own. As of last month, it provides a home to five mothers and eight children. 'Whenever I walk around the neighbourhood now, I can't stop noticing how many houses in our neighbourhood are standing empty and could shelter more people,' he added. 'It's madness.' Finding empty homes to permanently house the Ukrainian diaspora is going to be a challenge, especially in large German cities that are already suffering a chronic housing shortage, such as Berlin. Unlike the Syrians and Afghans who arrived before, Ukrainian passport-holders are not bound to the municipalities they have been allocated to, but can vote with their feet where they want to live and work. 'The immigration system that Germany has developed for Ukrainian refugees is in many ways a desired outcome,' said Peter von Auer, a legal adviser to refugee rights advocacy group Pro Asyl. 'We've spent years arguing that free choice creates a fairer system.' Tarek Alkouatly, 23, arrived in Germany from eastern Ghouta in October 2015, fleeing the war in Syria as an unaccompanied minor. After his arrival, he spent a night at Dortmund's Fritz-Henssler-Haus, a youth centre repurposed as a temporary refugee shelter. Seven years later, Alkouatly is back at the same centre, this time as a volunteer, helping Ukrainians fill out forms in bureaucratic German and transporting food and blankets in his seven-seater car. 'I came to Germany without speaking the language, and that was at times extremely stressful,' said the Syrian, who is currently completing his secondary school education while working as a courier in the evenings. 'Now that I speak German, I see it as my duty to help.' 'Ukrainians have seen war, bombs and death like us, wrought by the same enemy. If you've only seen war on TV you might want to help them, but not as strongly as when you've experienced it yourself.' Asked how he felt about Ukrainians being able to participate in German society without having to overcome some of the same the legal and bureaucratic hurdles that faced him and his compatriots, Alkouatly said: 'If I am being really honest, it can feel a bit unfair sometimes. 'But of course I am happy they have fewer problems. It would just be nice if that was the same experience of all those fleeing war in the future.'", "12428fbc63faf3b5947ceb5b8cf723ed8b094a0a138c17ca5eb8338c": "Russia has bombarded Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv, as part of its renewed push in the east of the country, while claiming the 'draft of a possible treaty' between the two countries is being discussed on a daily basis. One person was killed and five were injured 'as a result of enemy artillery and mortar strikes', Kharkiv's regional military administration said on Telegram. Despite the bombardment, Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said: 'The situation in the Kharkiv region is tough. But our military, our intelligence, have important tactical success.' Ukrainian forces said they had recaptured a 'strategically important' village of Ruska Lozova, near Kharkiv, and evacuated hundreds of civilians. One Kharkiv resident, Antonina, told AFP she returned home to find a rocket had smashed through her building and lodged in her bathroom. 'When I came home, everything was destroyed ... It was scary,' she said. Three months into an invasion that failed in its short-term aim of capturing Kyiv, Russia is now intensifying operations in the eastern Donbas region and tightening its stranglehold on the devastated southern port city of Mariupol. A senior Nato official said Russia had made only 'minor' and 'uneven' advances in their attempt to encircle enemy positions as Ukrainian forces counterattacked. The Pentagon said the Kremlin's eastern offensive was 'behind schedule' as airstrikes were failing to facilitate lightning ground offensives. Russia has been forced to merge and redeploy units from failed advances in Ukraine's north-east, the UK's Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence report released on Saturday morning. 'Russia hopes to rectify issues that have previously constrained its invasion by geographically concentrating combat power, shortening supply lines and simplifying command and control. Russia still faces considerable challenges. It has been forced to merge and redeploy depleted and disparate units from the failed advances in north-east Ukraine. Many of these units are likely suffering from weakened morale. 'Shortcomings in Russian tactical coordination remain. A lack of unit-level skills and inconsistent air support have left Russia unable to fully leverage its combat mass, despite localised improvements.' Zelenskiy said in his address that Russia wanted to make Donbas 'uninhabited'. 'The occupiers are doing everything to destroy any life in this area,' he said. 'Constant brutal bombings, constant Russian strikes at infrastructure and residential areas show that Russia wants to make this area uninhabited.' Zelenskiy described Mariupol as a 'Russian concentration camp in the middle of ruins'. 'And the order of the occupiers in that part of Mariupol which they unfortunately still control differs insignificantly from what the Nazis did in the occupied territory of eastern Europe,' he said. Ukrainian authorities said they had planned to evacuate civilians on Friday from the besieged Azovstal steel plant, the last holdout in Mariupol where hundreds were sheltering with Ukrainian troops. Ukraine's president called for a stronger global response to Thursday's strikes on the capital Kyiv, which immediately followed his talks in the city with the UN's secretary general, Antonio Guterres. 'It is unfortunate, but such a deliberate and brutal humiliation of the United Nations by Russia has gone unanswered,' he said. Guterres had also toured Bucha and other Kyiv suburbs where Moscow is alleged to have committed war crimes. Russia denies killing civilians. Guterres posted online afterwards: 'I was moved by the resilience and bravery of the people of Ukraine. My message to them is simple: we will not give up.' Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, claimed that a million people had fled Ukraine for Russia. Ukraine says people have been taken over the border against their will. Discussing the peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv, Lavrov, said the lifting of sanctions imposed on Russia was part of the negotiations. He said talks were 'difficult' but continued daily by video conferencing. Kyiv, though, has warned that talks are in danger of collapse, and Zelenskiy has insisted since the invasion that western sanctions on Russia needed to be strengthened and could not be part of negotiations. Ukraine and Russia have not held face-to-face peace talks since 29 March. In his latest address, Zelenskiy also said Ukraine would soon stamp out fuel shortages, even though Russian forces had damaged a number of oil depots. This week, Russia struck Ukraine's main fuel producer, the Kremenchuk oil refinery, as well as several other large depots. 'Queues and rising prices at gas stations are seen in many regions of our country,' Zelenskiy said. 'The occupiers are deliberately destroying the infrastructure for the production, supply and storage of fuel. 'Russia has also blocked our ports, so there are no immediate solutions to replenish the deficit. 'But government officials promise that within a week, maximum two, a system of fuel supply to Ukraine will be at work that will prevent shortages.' The economy minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, said the shortages would be eliminated within a week, as Ukraine's operators had secured contracts with European suppliers. With Reuters, the Associated Press and AFP", "051d4abd822fde26d7e075fc649346a13fb3e894f55df337db5bd75d": "Every week we wrap up the must-reads from our coverage of the Ukraine war, from news and features to analysis, visual guides and opinion. Analysis by Julian Borger explained how a series of mysterious explosions in Moldova has raised the threat of Russia's war in Ukraine spilling over into new territory, with unpredictable consequences. Separatist authorities in the Moscow-backed region of Transnistria have blamed the incidents on Ukrainian infiltrators, while the Kyiv government alleged they were false-flag attacks designed to provide a pretext for an infusion of Russian troops, just as similar blasts in the Donbas preceded the 24 February Russian invasion of Ukraine. A Russian move into Transnistria would pose an imminent threat to the sovereignty of Moldova, which, like Ukraine, has shown increasing interest in joining Nato. On Thursday, Moldova's deputy prime minister, Nicu Popescu, said the attacks represented 'a very dangerous new moment in the history of our region'. One of Europe's poorest countries, Moldova is grappling with a large influx of refugees and the economic fallout of the war, which has stopped nearly 15% of its exports. With the start of this new phase in the war, a layer is being stripped away from the buffer that has thus far kept Nato and Russia from coming into direct, hostile contact, during the cold war and since, Borger writes. And if the ominous explosions in Transnistria are auguries of a new Putin gambit, Moldova could find itself to be the next proving ground where this dangerous new world makes itself felt. Dan Boffey in Brussels, Philip Olterman in Berlin and Rob Davies in London wrote about the consequences for Europe after Russia halted gas supplies to two EU countries and threatened others, in a move condemned by European leaders as blackmail. The move, described by Poland's prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, as a 'direct attack' on his country, was justified by the Kremlin as a response to a failure of the two countries to comply with demands for payments to be made in roubles. It has led, however, to a dangerous standoff as Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said any EU country giving in to Russia by paying for gas in roubles would be in breach of the bloc's sanctions regime, with which the UK and others have acted in lockstep. Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst for the UK and Europe at the foreign exchange company Oanda, said: 'This may be a warning sign to others in the hope that they don't follow suit, but if they do, the standoff could play havoc with energy prices. With the Kremlin putting itself in a position where it must apply the same punishment to all if they don't comply, Europe may find itself without Russian gas or looking weak.' Hungary has said it is happy to pay in roubles and, according to reports, three of Europe's biggest gas companies - Germany's Uniper, Italy's Eni and Austria's OMV - are also examining ways to comply with Putin's decree. In a separate piece of analysis, Rob Davies asks: how worried should Europe be? While in Warsaw, Kate Connolly looked at what the supply cut means for Poland, and how the country is reacting.  Isobel Koshiw visited Zaporizhzhia, the only large city in south-east Ukraine under Ukrainian control. It has become a destination for the hundreds of thousands of people who fled Russian occupation, but with 70% of the wider region under Russian military control, there are fears that Moscow's forces will attempt to take it. As preparations for the arrival of the war get under way, life in the city is surprisingly normal - even busy - for wartime Ukraine. 'You can see for yourself people are out, going to work - the city is prepared but it won't come to that,' said Ivan Ariefiev, the press secretary of the Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, at one of a series of war-related training courses being offered to the city's teachers and journalists. Attendees, who are then expected to train the wider community, were taught how to load a gun, administer first aid and do a basic medical evaluation.  Flechettes are rarely used in modern warfare. Small, metal and sharp like a dart, thousands can be stored inside each shell. Once fired, the shell will detonate on a timer, spreading the tiny arrows far and wide. The weapon was used in the first world war - dropped from airplanes to pierce the helmets of enemy infantry. Now, they are being removed from the heads and chests of civilians in Ukraine. Lorenzo Tondo reported on the discovery of the tiny metal arrows in bodies of men and women in mass graves, allegedly killed during the Russian occupation of Bucha, Ukraine. 'We found several really thin, nail-like objects in the bodies of men and women and so did others of my colleagues in the region,' Vladyslav Pirovskyi, a Ukrainian forensic doctor, told the Guardian. 'It is very hard to find those in the body, they are too thin. The majority of these bodies come from the Bucha-Irpin region.' Russian forces captured Bucha, 30km north-west of Kyiv, after ferocious fighting following Russia's invasion in February. Towards the end of March, mass graves containing the bodies of hundreds of people who had apparently been massacred came to light. As defence and security editor Dan Sabbagh explains, the west's war aims are expanding. On Monday, Lloyd Austin, the US defence secretary, said the west's goal was to 'weaken Russia' to the point where it could no longer threaten its neighbours. A day later, the British junior defence minister James Heappey said it would be 'completely legitimate' for Ukraine to use western weapons to strike inside Russia. On Wednesday, western officials said they would like to see Ukraine restored to the boundaries existing before 24 February - the start of the Russian invasion - 'as a minimum'. With Ukraine unable to achieve that objective on its own, the question will become how much more Britain and other Nato members are prepared to commit. On Wednesday, the British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, appeared very committed, adopting in her speech the most uncompromising of approaches to a final peace settlement: endorsing the measures above but also reparations - a payment to Ukraine for the damage Moscow had inflicted - in an echo of the principles followed by allied forces against Germany in 1919. Discussions on how to define failure in any peace settlement are at an early stage among the cell of diplomats from 'the Quad' - the US, UK, France and Germany - discussing the issue. The discussions will evolve as the battlefield evolves.

The multibillion-dollar order, to be unveiled in a Sydney airport hangar on Monday, brings the Australian carrier closer to launching record-breaking direct flights of nearly 20 hours on the lucrative 'kangaroo route' by mid-2025. Qantas has touted plans for the world's longest commercial flights for more than five years but delayed its 'Project Sunrise' due to the coronavirus pandemic. The deal is a breakthrough for the Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, who has described non-stop Sydney-London flights as the holy grail for the 101-year-old carrier. The Australian airline launched the route in 1947 with Lockheed Constellations, when it took several stops and 58 hours of flying. Today's one-stop flights take almost 24 hours. Qantas in 2018 started non-stop flights from Perth, in Western Australia, to London that take 17 hours to carry passengers 14,500km or 9,000 miles. The Airbus expansion comes days after Boeing further delayed the development of its 777X jetliner, which had at one stage been in contention to allow direct flights from Australia's east coast to London and New York. An Airbus-owned A350-1000 was flying on Sunday from Toulouse to Perth, tracking service FlightRadar24 showed. Qantas, which has said it would make a significant announcement on Monday about the future of its network, declined to comment. Airbus also declined to comment. On Sunday the West Australian newspaper said, without citing sources, that the Qantas order would include 12 A350s, 20 A321XLRs and 20 A220s as well as purchase rights for 106 more airplanes spread among the different types. Qantas in December selected Airbus as the preferred supplier for a major order to renew its ageing narrowbody fleet, in a blow to its incumbent supplier Boeing. An airBaltic A220 was parked in Sydney on Sunday, FlightRadar24 showed. That destination is not on a normal route for the European carrier. Australia has no A220 operators at present. Qantas declined to comment when contacted by Guardian Australia on Sunday except to say the airline was making an announcement on Monday.", "5e8ecd6ee378a6de0f0b8af385af005e62df939f7339658e3113578a": "School officials in Rochester, New York, are investigating allegations that a white teacher told his class of mostly Black students to pick seeds out of cotton and put on handcuffs during lessons on slavery in a seventh-grade social studies class. 'It made me feel bad to be a Black person,' one School of the Arts student, Jahmiere O'Neal, told reporters. The teacher was put on leave. School officials did not identify the teacher. The teachers union president, Adam Urbanski, told WXXI-AM that 'if someone departs from what they should be doing, they should suffer the consequences, but due process has to be allowed first'. The allegations came to light after an appalled parent posted on Facebook that her daughter was confronted with the cotton-picking lesson on Tuesday. 'He made a mockery out of slavery,' the mother, Precious Tross, also known as Precious Morris, told news outlets. 'I don't have a problem with you teaching our kids about slavery and what our ancestors went through and how they had to pick cotton,' she said. 'Our teachers back in the day told us that, but they don't bring in cotton and make you pick cotton seeds out of cotton.' Tross and Vialma Ramos-O'Neal, Jahmiere's mother, said the teacher let white children refuse to take part in the cotton-picking while not letting children of color opt out. 'I immediately was like, 'Oh, I'm not doing that,'' said Morris's daughter, Ja'Nasia Brown. 'And then he was like, 'Do it. It's for a good grade.'' On another occasion, the teacher brought in handcuffs and shackles, students said. Tross said that when her daughter balked at putting them on, the teacher threatened to send her to the principal's office or the school counselor. The parents are calling for the teacher's firing and for his license to be revoked. The school's principal, Kelly Nicastro, told parents in a letter school leaders 'take these allegations very seriously'. A statement from the school board called the allegations 'extremely troubling'. 'In a district of Black and brown students, it is important to be sensitive of the historical framework by which our students are engaging and learning,' board president Cynthia Elliott said.", "b23dfa2740484d316127d188df41b3e5d442c3e940c7993861bef4fe": "Jupiter and Venus, two of the solar system's brightest planets, will appear to almost touch in a rare celestial spectacle this weekend. Although in reality they will be millions of miles apart, for stargazers on Earth they will appear to be close enough to almost collide in a planetary conjunction that occurs once a year. However, this year Jupiter and Venus will look much closer together than usual and should be visible with just a pair of binoculars or even the naked eye. If you miss it, you will have to wait another 17 years for a repeat performance. As well as the extraordinary planetary conjunction on display, Saturn and Mars will also appear to be in a straight line with Jupiter and Venus. Brad Tucker, an astrophysicist at the Australian National University, said the planets had been moving closer together over the past couple of weeks. 'Although Venus and Jupiter get close to one another every few years, this time there is also Mars and Saturn in the mix which is pretty rare,' he said. 'If you have a telescope, a pair of binoculars or a decent camera, then you'll get an even better view.' Despite their close appearance, the planets will actually be 430m miles apart in orbit. The peak time to see the event in the UK was at about 5am on Saturday from a high vantage point with a clear eastern horizon. However, it will still be visible on Sunday and the days that follow as the planets move apart again. From London, it will be almost impossible to witness but the farther west in the country you are, the closer the planets will appear to be. Observers in Sydney, Australia, will have a clear view with the pair of planets due to rise in the east at about 3.30am local time on 1 May. 'The planets will differ in their brightness,' the chief stargazer at the Society for Popular Astronomy, Prof Lucie Green, told BBC News.

Three consecutive failed rainy seasons have brought hunger, malnutrition and mass displacement to millions of people in the Horn of Africa, including parts of Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya and Djibouti. Many girls in Ethiopia now face being married at a young age as their parents seek to find extra resources through dowries from the husband's family, and hope their daughters will be fed and protected by wealthier families, warned Catherine Russell, Unicef's executive director. Some areas of the vast Oromia region have seen steep increases in the practice, the UN children's agency said, citing local government data. In the East Hararghe zone, home to 2.7 million people, child marriage cases increased by 51%, from 70 recorded during a six-month period in 2020-21 to 106 in the same period a year later. It was just one of six drought-affected areas in Oromia to have seen a sharp rise in child marriages, Unicef said. Across those zones, cases have almost quadrupled. According to data received by Unicef this week, 672 cases of child marriage were recorded between February and August last year, whereas in the six months from last September to March this year, that number leapt to 2,282, local government figures showed.  'We're seeing increases in child marriage that are quite dramatic,' Russell said, noting that more than 600,000 children are thought to have dropped out of school as a result of the drought. She added that when girls were not in education and were forced to leave their homes, the risks of gender-based violence and of child marriage almost always increased. 'These people [have their daughters married] because they're desperate for one reason or another: they're afraid of violence; they're afraid for the safety of the girls; they need resources; they can't afford to feed them,' Russell said.  The impact was 'debilitating' for the girls in the long term, she added. 'It really cuts off all of their opportunities and ends up in a situation where they are more likely to start having children early; they are more likely to have children closer together; they're young, so they're not in a position to negotiate safe sex with their partners. It's just one problem after another for these girls.' The drought threatens to set Ethiopia back in its attempts to lower its levels of child marriage, which are among the highest in the world. According to demographic data from 2016, 40% of girls in the east African country are married before the age of 18 and 14% are married before their 15th birthday. Russell, who this week visited drought-hit areas, said she had discussed the issue with the country's president, Sahle-Work Zewde, who said it was a priority area for her. The drought is also pushing up the rates of severe acute malnutrition in the affected areas, with admission rates for children under five years old 15% higher in February this year than February last year. Russell, who visited sites where Unicef is treating malnourished children, said people were also being forced to drink contaminated water, putting them at risk of various diseases including cholera. 'We haven't seen it yet,' she said, 'but everyone's very worried about cholera.' As a result of lagging vaccination rates, measles has already made a return, with more than 1,000 cases in the Somali region of Ethiopia and 16 confirmed deaths. Like many in the humanitarian community, Russell said she was concerned that the huge global focus on Ukraine was sucking attention - and vital funds - away from other conflicts and crises around the world. 'I've been to that region, and I know how difficult it is there. I don't begrudge anybody in Ukraine the coverage, because they need resources as well, but I think the international community's not great at doing two things at once,' she said. Unicef's emergency drought appeal for the Horn of Africa had so far raised about 20% of its $250m (PS200m) target, she added. While welcoming the UK government's PS17m pledge, made in January and targeting the same region, she said it was 'not close to enough'.", "adb6c1a74cb5f0429d8a136632c97b6afa016b085bb825f24fe8bd50": "Four Canadian military cadets have died after their car drove into the water at their campus in Ontario. The incident happened early on Friday on the Royal Military College campus in Kingston, Canada's Department of National Defence said. The Canadian Forces National Investigation Service is investigating the incident. The college's commodore, Josee Kurtz, identified the officer cadets as Jack Hogarth, Andrei Honciu, Broden Murphy and Andres Salek. 'Four fourth-year cadets of the Royal Military College of Canada travelling in a single vehicle lost their lives when their car entered the waters on campus at Point Frederick on Friday,' Kurtz said on Friday night. Further details were not available. She said the four students were completing their Bachelor of Arts degrees. Hogarth and Salek were studying military and strategic studies and were going to become armour officers in the army. Investigators were on Friday examining the road and shoreline in boats and on foot. Late on Friday afternoon, the vehicle that carried the cadets was pulled from the water by authorities, CBC news reported. 'My heart breaks for the families and friends of the four officer cadets who lost their lives early this morning in Kingston,' the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, tweeted.

Parish, who had represented the safe west country seat of Tiverton and Honiton since 2010, said that on the first occasion he watched porn on his mobile phone next to other MPs, including women, he had done so by accident. But in an emotional interview announcing his resignation, in which he came close to breaking down in tears, he said his 'biggest crime' was to have done so again - this time deliberately and in what he called 'a moment of madness' - while waiting to vote. Explaining what had happened, Parish, who also runs a farm, told BBC Politics South West: 'The situation was that - funnily enough it was tractors I was looking at. I did get into another website that had a very similar name and I watched it for a bit which I shouldn't have done. 'But my crime - biggest crime - is that on another occasion I went in a second time.' Asked if that was deliberate, he admitted: 'That was deliberate ... that was sitting waiting to vote on the side of the chamber.' Parish added: 'I will have to live with this for the rest of my life. I made a huge terrible mistake and I'm here to tell the world.' The dramatic resignation, after a week of lurid allegations about MPs' conduct, comes just days before Thursday's local elections throughout the UK, which are being viewed as a key test of Boris Johnson's ability to survive as prime minister after Partygate and other scandals. Parish's exit now sets the stage for a second byelection battle this summer for the Tories, as Johnson fights for his political life. Last night Jess Phillips, Labour's shadow minister for domestic abuse and safeguarding, said that it appeared that Parish 'of his own admission' had committed a criminal offence under the Indecent Displays (Control) Act of 1981. The act states that: 'If any indecent matter is publicly displayed the person making the display and any person causing or permitting the display to be made shall be guilty of an offence.' It adds that: 'Any matter which is displayed in or so as to be visible from any public place shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to be publicly displayed.' Sentences range from a fine to up to two years in prison. Phillips, who said the law was not widely known about and therefore not often enforced, told the Observer: 'If this law was to be applied it appears he has committed an offence by his own admission.' Phillips said Labour would now call for a full review into the law's application and how many charges had been brought under it. She said a public information campaign should also be launched as a matter of urgency to enable people to know that watching porn where others could see it was already illegal, including on public transport. Phillips said: 'There are plenty of laws on the statute books that are meant to protect women and girls in society, however they are not enacted. They are very rarely enacted appropriately. 'People don't know they can complain about it. What we will do now is look into where charging has and hasn't happened [under this law], such as on transport networks where people watch it on the bus next you.' She added that greater awareness of the act would not be enough, but charges needed to be brought under it to demonstrate to people that watching pornography in public was completely unacceptable and would lead to prosecutions. On Friday Parish had referred himself to the parliamentary commissioner for standards, Kathryn Stone, for investigation, but had said he would only stand down if found guilty. He said yesterday he changed his mind after realising the pressure he was putting his family under and the damage he was doing to his party. Parish was identified and stripped of the whip on Friday afternoon after two female colleagues had claimed last week they had seen him looking at adult content on his phone while sitting near them in the chamber. Although Parish retained the Tiverton and Honiton seat with a majority of more than 24,000 in 2019, the Liberal Democrats are now certain to pour resources into the midterm contest there as they battle to re-establish themselves as a force in the west country. The Tories are already bracing themselves for another even tougher byelection test in the 'red wall' seat of Wakefield, after Conservative MP Imran Ahmad Khan resigned following a conviction for sexually assaulting a boy aged 15 in 2008. Labour had held Wakefield since the 1930s until Khan took the seat at the 2019 general election with a majority of 3,358. Writing in the Observer, Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle demands a radical overhaul of the working practices in Westminster, after a series of scandals over sexual harassment and bullying. Commons staff have been pushing for an overhaul for some time. They have raised concerns that the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme, set up in the wake of sexual harassment and bullying claims, remains a complicated, slow and often intimidating process. Some 43 complaints against MPs have been investigated by the service in the last three years. It is understood that the number for the current year is similar to last year's figure of 15 MPs. Hoyle is working to form a 'Speaker's conference' - essentially a cross-party committee - to examine swift reforms and back an overhaul. Such a conference was last called in 2008 to examine the representation of women, ethnic minorities and disabled people in the Commons. The committee will hear expert evidence before finalising the reforms. It would have to be formally approved by the government and the Commons.", "b31f009c6a386a05ef0ef5f6190627354103b70ff3e3d2ae8826e8f1": "Donald Trump's last White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, has accused the congressional committee investigating the US Capitol attack of leaking all the text messages he provided in what he says is an effort to vilify him publicly. The argument was made in a filing on Friday in federal court in Washington, where Meadows sued in December to invalidate subpoenas issued for his testimony and to Verizon for his cellphone records. In the latest filing, lawyers asked a judge to reject the committee's request for a ruling that could force Meadows to comply with the subpoenas. The committee requested an expedited briefing schedule on Wednesday after filing its motion the previous week. The lawyers say Meadows deserves a chance through the fact-gathering process known as discovery to gather information about questions still in dispute, such as the committee's claims that Trump did not properly invoke executive privilege over the items subpoenaed because he did not communicate that position directly. 'Mr Meadows cannot possibly know whether that unsupported contention is true without discovery - or whether the select committee had awareness of former president Trump's assertions,' the motion states. It adds that Meadows must have the ability to obtain any communications between the committee and Trump and possibly to take depositions of people familiar with those discussions. The House voted in December to hold Meadows in criminal contempt after he ceased cooperating, referring the matter to the justice department, which has not said if it will take action. Meadows's legal team has said he provided extensive cooperation but that the committee refused to respect Trump's assertion of executive privilege. The motion by Meadows also accuses the committee of waging a 'sustained media campaign' against him. Though it does not provide evidence, it says the committee has leaked all of the text messages Meadows has produced. 'The congressional defendants, under the auspices of a legitimate subpoena, induced Mr Meadows to produce thousands of his private communications only to use them in a concerted and ongoing effort to vilify him publicly through the media,' Meadows' attorney, George Terwilliger, wrote in the motion. Court filings by the committee have shown Meadows was in regular contact before 6 January 2021 with Republican allies who advanced false claims of election fraud and supported overturning the race won by Joe Biden. A filing a week ago cited testimony from a White House aide who said Meadows was advised there could be violence on 6 January. The committee declined through a spokesperson to comment about Meadows's accusations against the panel.", "c20d0f77311ee592c50960513b45cd1303c945539c17f94cd814b803": "Even though Donald Trump recently sparred with Mike Pence over whether the former vice-president could have done more to overturn Trump's loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential race, Trump on Friday handed an endorsement to Pence's brother in an Indiana congressional race. Trump's endorsement of Greg Pence, who is seeking a third term as the US House representative for Indiana's sixth congressional district, is politically intriguing for a couple of reasons. It comes a little more than a year after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol on 6 January 2021 and demanded - among other things - Pence's hanging. A bipartisan Senate committee has connected seven deaths to the attack, which delayed a joint session of Congress to certify Biden's win by several hours. And the endorsement comes a couple of months after Mike Pence, in a rare stand against the former president, rejected Trump's claim that Pence could have reversed Trump's election defeat during the joint congressional session that was temporarily interrupted by the Capitol insurrection. At one point that day, Secret Service agents tried to drive Pence away from the Capitol, where he was tasked with leading lawmakers' certification of the presidential election results. But Pence wouldn't leave, signaling his opposition to the mob's goal of keeping Trump in power, the Maryland Democratic congressman Jamie Raskin, who serves on a House panel investigating the Capitol attack, said recently. 'President Trump is wrong,' Pence told the conservative Federalist Society in February, according to National Public Radio (NPR). 'I had no right to overturn the election. The presidency belongs to the American people and the American people alone. And frankly, there is no idea more un-American than the notion any one person could choose the American president.' When asked later about his brother's remarks, Greg Pence stopped well short of agreeing with them, highlighting how reluctant Republicans are to speak out against Trump while it remains unclear how much power his still-coveted endorsements carry. 'I stand by my brother and always will, and I'll let him speak for himself about his remarks,' Greg Pence told NPR, in part. Greg Pence earlier this month also voted against referring criminal contempt charges against Trump aides Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino to the US justice department. Congress ultimately ended up making the referral, saying Navarro and Scavino ignored subpoenas issued to them as part of the investigation into the Capitol attack that imperiled Mike Pence. That stance on Friday helped the former vice-president's brother net a statement from Trump reading: 'Greg Pence has my Complete and Total Endorsement!' Trump also hailed the Republican congressman for opposing Biden's immigration policies on the southern border, keeping guns accessible, standing against abortion and supporting the military. Greg Pence's office did not immediately issue a statement in response to Trump's endorsement. The former oil executive and Marine Corps veteran is facing a challenger in James Dean Alspach in the Republican primary on 3 May. The victor would advance to an 8 November runoff against the winner of the Democratic primary, whose candidates are George Thomas Holland and Cynthia Wirth.", "33af56e6c90407a4d316f27e14eb079abbb6c2ed30edaea6b499a51a": "For weeks Hilton Acioli wrestled with the melodies and lyrics that would become the theme tune to one of the most remarkable political careers in recent history. Finally, one morning in the winter of 1989, something clicked. 'Lula la - a star is sparkling. Lula la - the flourishing of hope,' the Cat Stevens-loving Brazilian songsmith sang as he sat before his computer with a guitar. The subject of Acioli's ditty was Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, a shoeshine boy turned union leader who was preparing to launch a once-unimaginable bid to become Brazil's first working-class president. 'I felt so excited,' Acioli said of the moment he composed the unforgettable jingle for Lula's first presidential run. 'I called everyone on the campaign and told them: 'I think I've nailed it.'' Lula's debut campaign ended in failure but Acioli's song, Sem Medo de Ser Feliz [Unafraid of Being Happy], became an enduring hit, providing the soundtrack as the bearded leftist continued his quest for power over the coming years. Lula lost two more elections, in 1994 and 1998, before finally triumphing in 2002 - a watershed moment for Latin America's largest democracy that ushered in almost a decade of historic social inclusion and poverty reduction. Many thought Lula's extraordinary poverty-to-power tale was over when he stepped down in 2010 with sky-high approval ratings and having been declared 'the most popular politician on Earth' by Barack Obama. When Lula was jailed for alleged corruption and barred from the 2018 election his political future looked in shreds. But allies say the chaos unleashed by the man who won that year's election, the far-right radical Jair Bolsonaro, and Lula's unexpected political rehabilitation last year, persuaded the veteran leftist to postpone retirement and return to the fray. 'There's just no way he would flee from this mission,' said Fatima Bezerra, a leading figure in Lula's Worker's party (PT) who has known him since its foundation in the 1980s. 'He understands perfectly the danger we are facing,' Bezerra said of the incessant authoritarian outbursts from Brazil's dictatorship-admiring president. 'What's at risk right now is democracy itself.' On 7 May Lula, now 76, will formally announce his sixth bid for the presidency, at an event in Sao Paulo. Acioli's anthem is again on the playlist as a new generation of leftwingers look to bring the curtains down on Bolsonaro's ultra-conservative era. 'They're going to have to swallow the fact that Lula will be our country's next president,' said Nanda Matinny, a 24-year-old actor, after dancing to a remixed version of Acioli's jingle at a pro-Lula rally near Rio. Matinny, who was five when Lula first took power in 2003, said the song made her feel nostalgia for a past she was too young to have known. 'I want to live through what I didn't live through before. I need to,' she said. 'We need this man to be elected to reconstruct Brazil.' Tens of millions of Brazilians seem to agree, with polls giving Lula a substantial advantage over Bolsonaro, a former paratrooper who many blame for catastrophically botching Brazil's response to a Covid outbreak that has killed more than 660,000 people, as well as undermining democracy and devastating the environment. Felipe Nunes, the head of the pollster Quaest, said Lula's lead did not mean he was seen as an 'untainted character' or that voters had forgotten the major corruption scandals that marred his administration and that of his successor, Dilma Rousseff. But, unlike the incumbent, Lula was considered a dependable political expert who could bring stability. 'People are looking for someone who can sort out the economy. People are looking for the hope of having a decent quality of life once again,' said Nunes. Many progressive Brazilians worry about the lack of generational renewal at the top of Lula's party, whose key figures are mostly now in their 60s or 70s. Lula will be 81 at the end of his term if elected. But the former president remains by far Brazil's best-known leftwing politician and - with no immediate heir in sight - the one best placed to defeat Bolsonaro. During an interview at his home in Natal, the seaside capital of the northeastern state of Rio Grande do Norte, Acioli expressed optimism Lula would be able to end four years of Bolsonarian misery in October's election. 'Everything suggests he's going to win,' the 82-year-old composer enthused. Bezerra, Rio Grande do Norte's governor, said she was 'immensely hopeful' her friend would lead Brazil out of 'authoritarian and obscurantist nightmare'. 'I've seen him and he's full of energy and raring to go,' said Bezerra, 66, flanked by a red Lula banner stamped with the words: 'Brazil Happy Again'. Yet recent weeks have suggested Lula's mission may be tougher than some progressives had hoped. With public anger over Brazil's Covid disaster apparently fading as normality returns, some polls have shown Bolsonaro gaining ground. Around the corner from Natalia Bonavides's headquarters in Natal, a graffiti artist has painted a pun on the president's name: 'Acabou-sonaro' (Bolson-over). But Bonavides, the PT's youngest member of congress, urged the president's opponents not to underestimate him. 'Even after all the tragedies that have been caused over the last three years, Bolsonaro remains an extremely strong candidate,' the 33-year-old insisted. Bonavides, who is one of the leading lights of Brazil's new left, said part of the danger was Bolsonaro's ability to use the state machine and federal funds to buy political support and win over voters. She also worried about the dissemination of fake news, whether Bolsonaro would accept the election result, and the poisonous political atmosphere that has gripped Brazil under its pro-gun president. In recent weeks the Donald Trump-admiring populist has billed the 2022 election as an epic war between God-fearing 'good' and communist 'evil' leading some to fear violence. Bonavides feels the toxic mood more than most. Last year a rightwing television pundit who is close to Bolsonaro publicly declared that people like her needed eliminating with machine guns and urged her to stick to washing her husband's pants. A picture of Marielle Franco, the leftist Rio politician who was assassinated in 2018, hangs outside Bonavides's office - a reminder of the dangers of doing politics in 21st-century Brazil. But the young congresswoman vowed to persist. 'I can't say I'm not afraid ... but it's crucial we don't allow these things to paralyse us.' Bonavides believed one of the keys to beating Bolsonaro was engaging with the urban poor who were worst hit by the economic fallout from Covid. On a recent evening she drove north to an abandoned railway depot that had been occupied by dozens of impoverished families Bonavides said had been plunged further into destitution by Bolsonaro's social policies, rising unemployment and inflation. 'Every day new families are arriving. It's frightening,' said one of the occupation's leaders, Matheus Araujo, as families used mud-caked sheets of plastic and planks of rotting wood to build shacks in the dank warehouse around him. Outside, Bonavides pledged to help the squatters fight eviction and urged them to make the link between their plight and the policies of Brazil's current leader. 'The Bolsonaros of this world have never done anything to grant people their rights - and they never will. Because rights aren't granted - they are seized,' she shouted through a loudhailer, as an activist clutched a red flag emblazoned with the words: 'Fora Bolsonaro!' (Bolsonaro Out!). For all his excitement over Lula's comeback, the composer Acioli also sounded a note of caution, comparing the coming months to a political minefield. 'Many pitfalls lie ahead,' the musician warned. 'Even now, there are so many lies that people still believe.' Despite the scale of Brazil's coronavirus calamity and the corruption scandals that have blighted Bolsonaro's administration and relatives, the president has retained the unwavering support of about 25% of voters. Hardcore followers remain convinced their leader is spearheading a righteous conservative crusade to stop Brazil becoming a communist dictatorship under Lula. Thomas Traumann, a political commentator and former communications minister under the PT, said it was wishful thinking to imagine Bolsonaro stood no chance. 'Lula is the favourite. It's 70-30. But that doesn't mean 70 always wins,' Traumann warned, urging Lula's campaign not to underestimate the depth of anti-PT feeling and the association many still made between the party and economic crisis and corruption. Helio Oliveira, an air force reservist and pro-Bolsonaro activist in Natal, said he would consider leaving Brazil or moving to a remote part of the countryside if Lula won: 'He's a bad character who lacks values.' As he pondered the coming showdown, Acioli sat down on his veranda and began to perform the song he had written to launch Lula's first campaign more than three decades ago. 'Unafraid to be happy! Unafraid to be happy! Unafraid to be happy!' he sang as he strummed his guitar. 'It's unfortunate to talk about a saviour of the nation but that's kind of what it is. There is no one else,' Acioli said. Bonavides was a baby when Acioli wrote his most famous ballad but, like millions of Brazilians, knows its lyrics by heart. She said it reminded her of how close Lula came to succeeding in his first presidential bid, and how close to reclaiming power he is now. 'It's song that brings me great hope,' she said, a portrait of her party's leader hanging on the wall behind her. 'Bolsonaro represents the cesspool of politics and Lula represents hope,' Bonavides said. 'Lula - as [Salvador] Allende would say - represents the great avenues down which free women and men will pass.'", "4f0e7799a1780c15e50d75be91ac7934b3ad617a13dfd788a2947ff3": "Berkshire Hathaway Inc shareholders on Saturday rejected proposals to have an independent chair replace Warren Buffett, and require his company to disclose more about its climate-related risks and efforts to improve diversity. Shareholders supported letting Buffett keep both the chairman and chief executive roles by a nearly 6-to-1 margin, Berkshire said at its annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. Buffett, 91, has run Berkshire since 1965. The National Legal and Policy Center, a Berkshire shareholder, had said it was poor corporate governance for the legendary investor to retain both roles. Its proposal gained greater attention when Calpers, which invested $460bn on 28 April and is the largest US public pension fund, expressed support, as it has at other companies. Berkshire's board, however, said Buffett should keep both roles. Buffett's oldest son, Howard Buffett, a Berkshire director, is expected to become non-executive chair when his father is no longer in charge. By approximately 3-to-1 margins shareholders also rejected proposals to have the company disclose more about the climate-related risks, greenhouse gas emissions and diversity efforts in its dozens of businesses. Berkshire's board also opposed those proposals, saying its operating businesses already disclosed or appropriately managed environmental risks, and were committed to diversity, equity and inclusion.

But after a back injury forced him to retire from construction work in 2018, Chen can only afford rent if he works multiple part-time jobs - and that's with his unit being rent stabilized. 'Once I pay the rent, life is very hard,' Chen said, through a translator. Recently proposed rent increases of up to 9% prompted Chen to join a coalition protesters calling on New York City's mayor, Eric Adams, to roll back rising rent. 'A lot of us can't pay the rent and we can't even buy food,' Chen said at a rally organized by the Rent Justice Coalition group at New York's city hall park on Thursday. For the millions of New Yorkers living in rent stabilized buildings, many of whom are still financially recovering from disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, recently proposed rent hikes are stoking panic and widespread pushback throughout the city.

For the past five years, the RGB has voted - at most - for a rent increase of 1.5% for one-year leases and 2% for two-year contracts, increases that New Yorkers say have already put added pressure on tight-squeezed paychecks. But, staff of this year's RGB, with three new members appointed by Adams, have proposed hikes of 4.5% for one-year leases and up to 9% for two-year leases. Elected officials and tenants argue the added costs will displace a staggering number of residents. 'Is the mayor's goal to have hundreds of thousands of homeless people? Because if that's his goal, he's heading in the right direction,' said Pilar DeJesus, a senior advocacy coordinator at the organization Take Root Justice. DeJesus, who spoke at Thursday's protest, said that is because many tenants are still grappling with income loss and financial stress amid the pandemic. 'First, they were worrying about dying. Now they gotta worry about being homeless and dying on the street,' DeJesus said, adding that increased rent will exacerbate crime and mental health problems in the city. Julius P Bennett, a Bronx tenant who also spoke at Thursday's rally, seconded the concerns of Chen and DeJesus. Bennett, whose income primarily comes from his pension and social security, said that he and other tenants in his building would have to move amid proposed rent increases. Bennett also said past rent increases have not prevented his building from falling into disrepair. 'Nine per cent would be exorbitant,' said Bennett, who leads his building's tenant union. Chi Osse, a city council member who spoke at the protest, said that constituents in his district, which includes the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood and parts of Crown Heights, often report excessive rent increases that Osse believes are unlawful. 'We've been getting calls from tenants saying that their landlord was gonna increase the rent by $700 by the time May 1 comes around and we're hearing even crazier prices,' said Osse, adding that Bedford-Stuyvesant lost the most amount of Black residents out of any New York City neighborhood . Bennett, DeJesus and others who spoke at the rally also noted that tenants facing eviction often do not receive the competent counsel to which they are legally entitled. That would be only be worsened in light of higher rent and possible wave of new evictions. 'Is that because we are the poor? You don't have to provide for us, whatever the law says?' Bennett said. In response to a request for comment on how proposed rent increases would impact New Yorkers, the mayor's office forwarded an answer Adams had given at a previous press conference: the RGB would only approve a proposal that wouldn't increase evictions. Adams also added that rent increases were meant to support small-building landlords who were falling behind on their bills because the pandemic halted payments. 'We don't want to aggravate the eviction process, but we also got to look at small property owners,' Adams said at a 21 April press conference. 'And sometimes when we think about landlords, we think about the mega guys ... but these small mom and pops have been decimated.' But a 2018 analysis from the non-profit JustFix.nyc calls into question who the suggested increases would serve. The majority of rent-regulated apartments are owned by large landlords, defined as those who own more than 20 buildings, the analysis found. Adams's office also noted that board members wouldn't make a final decision until June and weren't bound by their staff's recommendations. But many have questioned if newly appointed members of Adams's RGB, which include both a landlord lawyer and an avowed skeptic of rent control, would weigh tenants' concerns over rent hikes. 'You need to understand the impact on working-class people,' Chen said.", "bc1b1d5f53a5072f388285863568e3a5c54ffc8ee0aef6b7ac242217": "The family of a retired British geologist facing the death penalty in Iraq have called on the UK government to urgently intervene. Jim Fitton, 66, was detained by authorities in the Middle Eastern country, accused of smuggling, during a geology and archaeology trip. Fitton, who lives in Malaysia, and an unnamed German man were arrested when airport security found shards of broken pottery in their luggage as they attempted to leave the country, according to his children. But they said he had been informed the fragments held no economic or historical value to Iraq before collecting them at a site in Eridu on 20 March. Now they say he is due to face trial in the week commencing 8 May, after Eid al-Fitr in Iraq. His children, Joshua and Leila, and Leila's husband, Sam Tasker, say Fitton could receive the death penalty if found guilty and have launched a petition calling on the British government to intervene in the case. A statement read: 'We have days to save him before sentencing and we need the Foreign Office to help by intervening in his case now. 'Our lawyer has drafted a proposal for cessation of the case and the immediate repatriation of our father, which requires the backing of the Foreign Office to put to the Iraqi judiciary.' Tasker added: 'Jim would often bring home small souvenirs from his trips to remember the journey by and share his experiences with us. To him this was no more significant than bringing home a small stone from the beach to remember a special family holiday. The items are widely agreed to be valueless. 'This is the offence that now sees my father-in-law facing a potential death sentence under article 41 of the Iraqi artefacts law no 55, of 2002.' He said the pair were arrested after the group's baggage was checked at the airport, with 12 shards said to have been found. Tasker is a constituent of Wera Hobhouse, the Liberal Democrat MP for Bath, who has raised the case in the House of Commons and urged ministers to respond to the 'incredibly serious' matter. The Foreign Office minister Amanda Milling, in a letter to Hobhouse, said: 'We understand the urgency of the case, and have already raised our concerns with the Iraqi authorities regarding the possible imposition of the death penalty in Mr Fitton's case.'", "8f1d3e1ed12d9bfedd00471ef139a396c7d8c11e2787c41ab2371ed3": "", "99a8ce6810104ce8156da40568dff8b3f67049045c5ac7db1c53bc0e": "", "b68d4f269914d96e1db796e88d029abdde8aab6a55b0ff5edab4cba5": "", "9d643c94dcb702921402a4c608d471908a94e8cff84f5620ad53d76b": "", "cd4c1e0c5d4389306f6476ce1b51232123450ca15d87df120a1bac5b": "", "43e9a9c4a72350de7b70b5f81dec6e40fb5c48cf7e63cfb13e70f77c": "", "d0c761fa22650fe46f2da22103a864b9e6ba89f63ad7acb0ad8cd000": "", "45c6792adfdf3822d51e7ed962f95a896829da603d1ae641576c487a": "", "43e04642e9143054451de2a73ae87996cedc8c5eb3468839107b1dc7": "", "ab909998cfe47b2dd3ed6479398d8dbcf585642391ce8d219d226761": "", "b807891c59515d251e3d81c5c05bcc8968d7868cc1e9359d5f5ca4f8": "", "28427c84506d144c4a60524d026f0d2c28aadc8c698b170fe5643c50": "Michael Horvath took up hiking and yoga during the pandemic when his usual cycle to work was off limits. Like almost 100 million others in nearly 300 countries he was able to track his chosen activities on Strava - the app for sporty types he co-founded 13 years ago. Conceived as a 'virtual locker room' through which cyclists could compete against their mates, the app boomed during the pandemic as millions of people looked at ways to get active and join online clubs that would inspire them to keep going. At the peak in April and May 2020, the app saw 3 million people a month joining - triple its previous level. That has since slipped back to 2 million a month, but Horvath believes the app could reach 1 billion users within a decade. On the horizon now is a move to get the business on stock market leaderboards, as the pandemic, and now a fuel crisis, drive a permanent shift towards physically active travel. In the UK, already 17% of the adult population is on the platform, or more than 9 million people. 'What the pandemic did in a lot of ways has accelerated what would have happened already but forced it to happen sooner and gave us the space to think about it. It is happening in the next couple of years instead of 10 years from now,' says Horvath. He wants Strava to be a tool to help continue to drive that change, with data from its cyclists and walkers' activities used to help design and validate rejigs of town and city centres. Since 2020, the app has been making its data available free to local authorities and public bodies, including Transport for London, Transport for Greater Manchester and Active Travel England; now more than 1,500 such bodies are using it, compared with just 50 pre-pandemic. Horvath says Strava decided offering free data was better for the company in the long run because it would help more people get active and become potential app users.  For example, the number of female cyclists joining Strava more than doubled during the first year of the pandemic, as, it appears, women felt safer taking to the streets as protected bike lanes popped up around the country and cars stayed at home. 'Anecdotally, look at San Francisco, Paris, London and Stockholm, where I've spent some time recently since the pandemic. The pandemic not only created more sense of demand from people who live in these cities but also the supply increased too. We saw immediately how city authorities responded by creating quieter streets and repurposing streets to serve the people,' Horvath says.  He says there has been a drift back to more car use but believes local authorities will nevertheless continue to invest in 'enabling people to move through cities under their own power'. Horvath believes getting involved with improving towns and cities is 'incredibly important' in motivating the group's 350 staff, and also gives Strava's clientele another reason to sign up and map and share their routes. He says finding new ways to create a sense of camaraderie and fun - and offer more services, such as tips on where to get active on holiday or ways to monitor non-active health concerns such as sleep and nutrition - will help drive the company's future growth. The app has already extended from just cycling to 33 activities, including rock climbing, surfing and using a wheelchair, and links to more than 30 devices which measure performance, from Garmin and Fitbit activity trackers to Peloton exercise bikes. 'We focus on building things athletes love to use - and hopefully find things they will pay for so business will thrive,' Horvath says. That format - offering a certain amount free with premium services accessed via subscription (of PS4 a month in the UK) - was a key part of Horvath's reinvention of Strava. He stepped back in as chief executive of the then loss-making business in 2019, after five years out to care for his four children and terminally ill wife. 'It was pretty clear [the business] was not financially sound and needed to make changes and I stepped back in,' he says. The reinvention also included extra security measures, which he says focus on providing better education around the app's controls and automatic privacy zones around the start and finish of journeys amid concerns over safety, particularly for women. The app gained notoriety in 2018 for revealing sensitive information about military bases thanks to staff logging their exercise routines on Strava's app. Horvath says he was partly motivated to return to the company by a desire to realise a vision partly influenced by his wife Anna, whom he married when they were both in their early 20s and who died in 2017. The business was practically part of the family, first mooted with co-founder Mark Gainey as a way to virtually recreate the camaraderie, and competition, of the Harvard rowing club where they met in the 1980s. Horvath and Gainey first pitched the idea of a 'virtual locker room' in the mid-1990s, but it generally received a negative response. Instead, the pair made a fortune by developing consumer-services software firm Kana, which they floated in 1999. Horvath tried to return to teaching, but yearned for the entrepreneurial life. By 2008, he and Gainey were meeting up for brainstorming sessions that would result in the birth of Strava. The arrival of phones with GPS and activity tracking technology such as Garmin put muscle behind an idea that had been dismissed more than a decade before. However, it was the sporty revolution seen during the pandemic which gave Strava booster rockets, with revenues soaring 70% last year to about PS170m, 90% of which came from subscriptions and the rest mostly from sponsorship deals with brands. It was the second year of growth at that pace, which helped deliver Strava's first profit in 2020. Horvath says he is keen on seeking a public listing for the group, which was valued at $1.5bn when it raised $100m in November 2020 from investors including Sequoia Capital, which has backed the likes of PayPal and Zoom. But he doesn't appear to be in a rush to follow the tech firms, including DoorDash, Roblox and Deliveroo, who cashed in on their own pandemic booms. 'I do see it as something we'll do in the future,' he says of public listing, 'as a way to ensure longevity, [protect the] foundation we've built and do certain things we can't do as a private company. But it has to be done at the right time. It is not an end itself; it is a means to an end. 'We are trying to build the No 1 sports brand for the 21st century with technology and with digital experience. Not with shirts and shoes and gear but with something that fits into the way people are active in the 21st century. By enabling people to build a community they stay engaged their whole life. We want to be the record of the world's activities.'", "fb93b1207308ba9d103c4edccc91cd83d66f08691b6f7388a247d7fd": "Across much of the world people are taking international holidays, returning to the office, and going to festivals and political rallies. Faced with the seemingly unstoppable Omicron variant, they've decided to live as close to normality as they can in the presence of Covid-19, limiting its impact. But in Covid-zero China it's a vastly different story. An estimated 340 million people in at least 46 cities are under some form of lockdown or restrictions in China, as cases appear in multiple provinces - often in so far tiny quantities. On Thursday Guangzhou authorities grounded hundreds of flights after the detection of a suspected case. In Hangzhou all residents have been told to test every 48 hours if they want to travel around the city. In Shanghai some residents are hanging out their windows banging pots and pans in nightly protest at a weeks-long lockdown beset by food shortages. A loudspeaker driven through the streets tells them their protest has been 'incited by foreign forces', while flying drones urge they 'control your soul's desire for freedom'. In the capital, Beijingers are stocking up on food in case of a Shanghai-style lockdown as dozens of new cases are recorded each day, prompting lockdowns of residential buildings, the closure of schools and suspension of weddings, funerals and banquets. On the official evening news broadcast, little of this makes the cut. Instead the story is of successes in the battle to regain zero-Covid. More than two years into the pandemic, China is the last major government still committed to the policy, determined that even the uber-transmissable Omicron variant will be controlled through mass testing, travel curbs and lockdowns. China's officials maintain their approach is the best for both lives and the economy, and they have no choice but to hold firm on their approach. China's booster and vaccination rates, especially among the elderly, are not high enough and its medical system not sufficiently resourced or geographically equitable to avoid catastrophic illness and death. 'We try to run faster than the virus,' Li Bin, deputy director of the China's National Health Commission, said on Friday. 'No matter how the virus evolves we always put people and their lives first.' Foreign analysts and health experts agree China can't open up yet. They also point to questions over the efficacy of its domestic vaccines, and the refusal of the government to approve foreign-made vaccines. Even if it did, a year of propaganda criticising them has likely ensured few people will be keen. But the analysts also fear China won't join the world in living with Covid even when conditions are better. They say zero-Covid is so deeply tied to the political legitimacy of the Chinese Communist party and its leader, Xi Jinping, that there is no off ramp. As the impact of zero-Covid chafes the people's will and the economy's health, and a growing outbreak in the capital, that legitimacy may be under threat. 'The CCP's political legitimacy of power lies in its ability to provide livelihood, safety and health. They have to show their competency,' said Prof Chi Chunhuei, the director of Oregon State University's centre for global health. 'But local leaders also face a dilemma because they're also tasked with improving or increasing China's economic growth.' Zero Covid has undoubtedly saved lives, but other consequences of keeping the policy are biting. Economic analysts are forecasting continuing slowdowns in growth, and investors pulled a record $17.5bn in stocks and bonds out of China's market in March. Cargo ships and trucks have been backed up at ports and roads, factories stalled and warehouses at capacity. Foreign firms have pulled out of the Shanghai, or reported major problems in attracting and retaining talent. Finance workers and international teachers are reportedly packing up and leaving. Online and in Shanghai, there is a significant and public amount of domestic frustration which police and censors are struggling to keep up with. In apparent acknowledgement of the toll the pandemic was taking, last month Xi ordered officials to succeed with zero Covid but 'at the least cost and [to] minimise the impact of the epidemic on economic and social development'. This month Xi called for all-out efforts to spur infrastructure spending, pushing public development in a bid to drive the economy forward. There is very little space for officials to question Xi's Covid goals, saysProf Carl Minzner, China scholar and professor of law at Fordham Law School, but resistance is there. 'There are people in bureaucracy who realise the real cost this is imposing on citizens,' says Minzner. 'But when politics is in command there isn't this space for anything to rise up as reasoned discourse.' Dissenting opinions among the political and medical elite are occasionally going public but are quickly scrubbed from the internet, and years of Xi's anti-graft purges have removed or silenced many political opponents. Later this year the CCP will hold its twice-a-decade congress, at which Xi is expected to seek an unprecedented third term as leader. In recent years it's been spoken of as largely inevitable, but the timing and impact of China's worst outbreak, as well as the Ukraine war, has upset the stability he likely hoped would see him confidently through. 'There is some potential that a failure of zero-Covid, now he's taken such clear responsibility for it, is a challenge to Xi,' says Prof Mary Gallagher, a political scientist and China expert with the university of Michigan. 'We're in uncharted waters in how these transitions work. With constitutional amendments [introduced in 2018 to remove term limits] Xi is expected to get his third term but it's very unclear to see how it would actually happen.' Gallagher says the political elite is the most divided she's seen it since 1989, over not just Covid, but also the economy and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 'We know there is debate among the elites. Unfortunately it's hitting up against a time period for Xi Jinping which makes it very dangerous to open up.' Shanghai's attempts to avoid the lockdown were potentially overconfidence, says Gallagher, or an example of dissent among leaders who wanted to go a different way, says Chi. 'Shanghai is the largest city with the richest health and medical care resources,' Chi says, arguing the reason officials initially resisted a lockdown was because it would send a ripple effect throughout the nation: 'If the best resourced city has to lockdown [to contain an outbreak] then what happens to other cities?' But it backfired as cases overwhelmed the city, forcing 25 million people into lockdown anyway. After five weeks, Shanghai officials announced on Friday that more than 12 million people in districts now deemed low risk were able to leave their homes, but residents say there are still issues. Wang Yi-chun, a 27-year-old Shanghai resident who did not want to use her real name, says she's been allowed to leave her apartment, but rules change quickly and without notice, and she wishes she'd left the city when she had the chance. 'Before the lockdown in Shanghai, I never imagined that things would go to this level,' Wang says. 'I thought they'd have some process that prepared them to face situations like this. But they didn't have any.No solution has been developed during all this time. I don't understand what they are doing right now.' Beijing is now reporting dozens of cases a day, but as of Friday was only locking down individual residences and venues. Aside from panic buying things seem calm as residents in affected districts report for testing. There is faith in Beijing's authorities doing a better job than Shanghai's, but still with the usual arsenal of measures. 'Xi Jinping declared victory over the virus in 2020, and [pandemic] success has become emblematic of his own personal political success, ' says Minzner. 'Unless Xi himself decides to back down politically, I find it difficult to imagine how China retreats from a zero-Covid policy.'

In fact, today the very idea of being 'normal' has been exposed as a bit of a sham when it comes to sexuality, brain type, or even 'life goals'. But there is one area where the pressure to conform is still woven through our expectations and conversations, as well as through the marketing images that surround us all: the ideal of motherhood. Now the American film-maker Therese Shechter is tackling what she believes is a pervasive bias in favour of women having babies. Her provocative new documentary, My So-Called Selfish Life, has already been admired at festival screenings, with Ms magazine describing it as a 'striking and imaginative documentary, which addresses [an] oft-overlooked facet of reproductive justice'. From 6 May, it will be streamed (until 16 May) on Show&Tell, a streaming platform for documentaries. Although Shechter never disparages parenthood, she knows it will ruffle feathers. 'I don't relish making anyone angry, but that's what happens when you have an opinion. And this is important to talk about,' she says. 'I am not evangelical in the least, and I'm not negative about people who want children.' Shechter describes herself as 'anti-pronatalism', which means she is opposed to the defining templates imposed on women, but not to the basic notion of raising a family. 'It's important to talk about this thorny question without pitting parent against non-parent,' Shechter adds. 'It is just that women should now be treated like adults who know what is going to be good for us. At the moment we don't have full body autonomy. There's interference coming from what society values, from religious beliefs and from some bad science. All of it says it's our job to have babies.' Shechter herself chose not to become a mother and, from this perspective, she interviews several women who feel the same, from the crusading 1970s feminist Marcia Drut-Davis, to Shanthony Exum, who has opted to live with a group of friends, rather than start a family. As BBC Radio 4 prepares a new reading to celebrate Bridget Jones, the fictional 90s 'singleton' who had such entertaining neuroses, the pressure on young women remains strong. Last summer the British writer Emma John's book Self-Contained came out to acclaim, while the columnist Nell Frizzell, author of 2021's The Panic Years, launches her debut novel, Square One, this summer. A comedy, it focuses on the looming targets still set for women. Frizzell has also just made a radio documentary, Mother, Nature, Sons, about how her concern about climate change has affected her own view on parenthood. Is it actually selfish to consider having children when the future of the environment is so troubling? The whole guilt-ridden debate feeds directly into one of Shechter's main arguments. 'There are so many ways women are called 'selfish' or 'narcissistic', usually for doing what they want to do,' she says. 'The attempt to limit our choices is also a good way to control society. Women are often accused of putting themselves first when they don't want a baby. Yet then they are asked, 'Who will look after you when you are older?' as if that isn't a selfish concept.' Some of the unconscious policing is done by what Shechter calls 'concern trolling', whereby women without children are offered sympathy, whether they need it or not. 'Of course, there are many women who want children and cannot have them. I can't speak for them, but I don't think it helps for society to keep saying that having a child is the single thing that makes people the most happy.' Her film questions whether it can be coincidence that the idea of a ticking biological clock arrived just when women began to enter the workplace. In the 1970s any rejection of what Shechter calls a phoney biological imperative was regarded as radical and dangerous. Drut-Davis's belief that motherhood was not going to be for her led to being interviewed for the leading US TV news show 60 Minutes on Mother's Day in 1974. She was filmed telling her in-laws that she had decided not to have children, in a broadcast that changed her life. 'I never regret what I did because I've learned through challenges,' she says this weekend. 'I wish I knew more about pronatalism and how editing can affect how I was perceived. My then husband hardly was heard, although he was very animated during the long interview. He was edited out! I was the mean bitch breaking in-laws' hearts, when he was equally in acceptance of the child-free lifestyle.' Drut-Davis recalls the show ending with the presenter apologising into the camera lens: 'Pardon our perverseness in airing this on Mother's Day.' In her book, John faces down the same insistent call to duty and the fear of an internal ticking clock. 'I thought I'd got through my 20s and 30s without too much worry about being single or motherhood. But then I realised I had always thought of myself as just 'pre-married',' she says. 'In my 40s there were a lot of internal narratives I suddenly had to deal with. Marriage and having children are the markers of adulthood. If you step off this conveyor belt, does that mean you are infantile? Are you irresponsible because you are not taking care of anyone else?' But then came an 'eye-opening experience' for John in lockdown, as she cared for her parents during her mother's final illness. 'My sister was nine months' pregnant with her second child and so a lot of it naturally fell to me. This is in many ways a traditional role for an unmarried daughter, but it also showed me a caring side to my nature and I realised I was not so selfish.' John points out that even today women are regularly celebrated only as wives or as mothers. And Shechter's film also looks at this pernicious side of the traditional ways that women are validated. Her own mother, who appears in the film, does not approve of Mother's Day, it is revealed, because it raises one woman above another. 'My mother is a self-effacing person and she grew up in Europe, where the tradition was not such a big thing,' says Shechter, who is based in New York, 'but she also rightly feels it is a problematic day for lots of people for many reasons.' The dressing up of motherhood in ribbons and bows, for Shechter, is tantamount to coercion. Fertile women, she argues, are placed on a pedestal by society as a way of duping them into accepting the difficult and limiting world of child-bearing. It is akin, as the pioneering American psychologist Leta Hollingworth set out more than a century ago, to the way that men are prepared for war. 'In her brilliant essay Hollingworth showed there was also the same emphasis on service and sacrifice in compelling someone to enlist for something that was likely to lead to the loss of their life, since childbirth was the biggest killer of women at the time.' What then lies ahead today for a woman who does not stake her security in old age on creating a new family? For Exum, one of Shechter's powerful screen interviewees, the prospect of growing old among friends is a more reliable one. 'The assumption that a child-parent relationship will be perfect or easy is false,' she says, in explanation of her choice to live a childless domestic life with friends. 'Like any relationship, it takes work to truly understand the other person and patience and openness to communicate and truly listen. I know some people who have fabulous relationships with their parents and children, while some have more fraught ones. Nothing is guaranteed, so I feel the assumption is the dangerous part.' My So Called Selfish Life (watch.showandtell), made by Trixie Films, is the third in a trilogy of documentaries by Shechter, each intended to dismantle common beliefs about womanhood. Her first was about power and feminism, and the second, sex and virginity", "e6708b099327ede0277d7bc2c1d23d3ca9924e5d1904bf8757bffa0f": "At 7am on a clear day in Algiers, Nouara looks out of her window to the narrow street below that leads to the market, and declares: 'I can't stand living here any more.' Nouara, 65, wants nothing more than to leave her country, and is now considering boarding one of the boats that carry migrants on the often deadly crossing over the Mediterranean to Spain. 'I've lost the tiny hope I had in this country,' she says. Nouara, who preferred not to give her full name, lost her husband, Foudhil, to Covid in 2020. He was one of more than 6,800 Algerians reported to have died so far. 'Despite his advanced age, he was a man in good condition - healthy and active,' she says. 'He died overnight, after a drastic lack of oxygen.' Nouara is struggling. The antique wooden table in her living room is covered in papers: visa application forms and copies of her birth certificate. The couple had no children, but Foudhil had some from a previous marriage. 'My husband's children cut off his retirement allowance and I am now living on crumbs. If my visa application to France gets rejected, I will sell this small apartment and board the speedboat. 'I know it is illegal and unsafe,' she says. 'But I am seeking a decent place where I can spend what remains of my life in dignity.'According to the Spanish authorities, at least 10,000 Algerians reached the Spanish coast this way between January and December 2021 - 20% higher than the previous year. Most depart from the western coast, from cities including Oran, Chlef and Maghnia, mainly in summer when the sea is calmer. The shortest distance between Algeria and the Spanish coast - Oran to Almeria - is 150km (90 miles).Smugglers charge between EUR2,000 (PS1,670) and EUR7,000 for one person. The higher the price, the bigger the engine and quicker the crossing, which can take from three hours to three days. El Harga means 'the burning', describing the act many illegal travellers go through of setting fire to their identity papers to stay anonymous and avoid repatriation if they get arrested in Europe. The pace of illegal migration has intensified recently, despite a 2009 law that can impose six-month jail terms on those arrested by the coastguard. Smugglers can get up to five years. In response to the soaring numbers, the Algerian government established the National Assembly for Raising Youth Awareness on the Dangers of Illegal Migration (ANSJIC) in 2018, to seek measures to solve the problem. More than 20 national organisations, officials from the interior ministry, local authorities and experts have participated. The ANSJIC, which has run meetings and workshops along some coastal cities to persuade people not to risk their lives, is considered a pioneering organisation. 'The aim is to raise awareness about the danger of El Harga, and preserve the country's human resources,' said Samir Zoulikha, president of ANSJIC. 'We are involving schools, mosques, sport clubs and families.'Nabil, who prefers to use one name, is also considering El Harga. He failed to find a job in his field after graduating from the National Institute of Marine Sciences and Coastal Development and makes a living by doing odd jobs. 'I spent four years applying for different employment, without any success,' says Nabil, now in his 30s. 'I started losing hope when I saw some university colleagues holding positions in some important institutions and bumped into the sad reality that I am not a descendant of a senior official.'His despair is clear. 'The ambitions I had for coastal development have melted away. I was fascinated by the sea and its enigmas. 'My mother needs money for dialysis,' he adds. 'But I can see no future here; El Harga is my only route to shape a good future for me and my family.' Zoulikha has persuaded Nabil is to take part in an ANSJIC conference aiming 'to train young volunteers on the proper ways to approach people who are considering fleeing the country illegally, not only to raise awareness of the dangers but to listen to their concerns and offer solutions,' he says. 'His attendance would give the conference a new dimension,' says Zoulikha. 'The previous meetings were mainly addressed to civil society and authorities. A face-to-face dialogue between officials and youths might lead to practical and tangible solutions.' Nouara has a visa appointment at the French embassy. She is excited. 'I am planning to head to Belgium after landing in France. My cousin offered to let me stay in her house there. I will try to find a job or at least volunteer at any civil society organisation. I can help with the skills I acquired as a teacher.'But France has recently decided to halve the number of visas it grants to people from Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, because of the north African governments' refusal to take back illegal migrants. 'If plan A doesn't work, illegal migration will be my last refuge,' says Nouara.

Hickinbottom was taking mind-numbingly dull evidence on how to apply for BVI citizenship, and whether the process was open to manipulation. The DEA source acting as a Mexican drug-runner, meanwhile, according to the court papers, was setting up a series of meetings that was to conclude with the arrest on Thursday of Fahie onboard a private jet in Miami where he was allegedly being shown designer shopping bags containing $700,000 as payment for the intended storing of 3,000kg of cocaine for four days. The payment was to keep the stash from the inquiring eyes of the port authorities and police, the papers filed in Florida claim. Fahie is expected to appear in court in Miami on Friday in relation to the charges. Ironically, the day before, Fahie, unaware that all his meetings were being recorded and videoed, had confided to the person he thought was the Mexican drug-runner - who was in fact a DEA informant - that he 'believed in witches and magic and how to read lies in people', according to the papers. The contrast between the stately evidence-gathering of the commission of inquiry and the methods of the US police agencies could not be more stark: Yes Minister meets Miami Vice. Indeed, before his arrest on Thursday, Fahie had thought he would survive politically, an interview with the Guardian in November suggested. He believed the as yet unpublished Hickinbottom inquiry might reveal maladministration, inefficiency and corners cut, but overall the initial lurid allegations of corruption made at the commission's launch by Augustus Jaspert, the previous BVI governor, in January 2021 were, he thought, going to be unproven. Fahie and his fellow ministers - represented at the inquiry by the Conservative MP and former attorney general Sir Geoffrey Cox - had used the court hearings to mount a counter case alleging the colonial UK government had been improperly interfering with the work of the elected politicians. Cox, whose work for the BVI resulted in allegations that he was moonlighting, had been assiduous in arguing that the London government over-reached its mandate. Hickinbottom submitted his report, known to contain 40 recommendations, to John Rankin, the current governor, before Easter, but he took his time to digest its contents before a deferred publication, probably in June. There is no indication whether or not he knew of the DEA sting operation. Certainly, it is clear from the affidavit submitted to the Miami court on Thursday by a special agent, Shad Aschelman, that the DEA operation had been under way since October. But it was not until 20 March that the BVI port authority managing director, Oleanvine Maynard, and her son Kadeem allegedly met what the affidavit describes as a DEA confidential source (CS). The CS told Maynard he was a member of the Sinaloa drug cartel and he needed a BVI port to store an initial 3,000kg cocaine for 24 to 48 hours until 'a window was open' to take the shipment on to Puerto Rico, the papers say. Maynard said they could get the licences, and added they would set up 'shell companies' into which the payments to her could be made. She allegedly demanded an upfront payment. Her son, according to DEA audio, allegedly said he had been drug-running for 20 years. According to the papers, the CS asked if the premier would want to be involved. Referring to the premier as 'head coach', Maynard allegedly said: 'I know the type of person he is. If he sees an opportunity, he will take it. He is a little crook sometimes. He is not always straight.' The CS allegedly gave Maynard $20,000 as a goodwill gesture. The next day, 22 March, less than a fortnight before Hickinbottom submitted his report on 5 April, Kadeem allegedly texted the CS on WhatsApp to say: 'The head coach wants to play with the team this season.' The CS had explained he could get the drugs to the BVI for about $4,000 a kg, but it would sell for $26,000 or $28,000 in Miami and for up to $38,000 in New York, the papers say. On 23 March, Kadeem allegedly explained that the 'head coach' was in, but he needed $500,000 up front to square another government official and to sort out the airports. On 7 April Fahie and the CS allegedly met on Tortola, where the premier, the DEA says, complained he was not paid much by the British government. The CS proposed Fahie be given a 12% cut of the sales in return for allowing the cocaine to pass through the BVI ports. Fahie, according to the affidavit, pulled out a calculator and worked out the street value of the cocaine in Miami was $78m, and if he got 10% he would receive $7.8m At one point during the meeting the confidential informant allegedly gave Fahie $20,000, saying: 'This is a good faith gift to seal that we have an agreement.' Fahie allegedly seemed suspicious of the DEA informant, asking him if he was an undercover operative. The CS said he was not and reassured Fahie: 'Well, first of all, you're not touching anything' - a reference to the planned shipments of cocaine. Fahie allegedly replied: 'I will touch one thing, the money.' He allegedly said Britain had been trying to get him out of office for years, adding: 'I have plenty of people and I don't sell them out to the British with their plans. Their plans are to catch people, they want to capture people - but me, I see what they are doing and protect people.' It was agreed that on 27 April $700,000 would be ready on a private jet at Opa Locka airport in Miami for Maynard to take back to the BVI, the court papers claim. In Miami the CS allegedly went through the plans for the payment one more time with Fahie, explaining $1m was coming down from New York. It would be divided into sums of $700,000 and $300,000 for CS operatives in Mexico. Fahie was then allegedly taken to the plane to see the money in the designer bags that was due to be flown to the BVI. It was there on the plane that he was arrested and he claimed: 'Why I am being arrested - I do not have any drugs or money?'", "92fe0f08d1b3f735bc3555017713ff7499974b9249e4cf8d761a7d2f": "Writers in Tokyo in search of an antidote to procrastination and unproductive work practices can now toil in the company of the similarly afflicted, united in their determination to confront the tyranny of the looming deadline. They can be found at the Manuscript Writing Cafe, which opened in April in the city's Koenji neighbourhood as a haven for writers, editors, proofreaders, video producers and manga artists - anyone struggling with the distractions of the home or office.  Committing to a specific writing goal is a condition of admission, as is an understanding that leaving in a fit of pique is out of the question before the task at hand has been completed. The cafe charges 150 Japanese yen ($1.15) for the first 30 minutes and then 300 an hour after that. Although a few people have stayed past the official closing time, they have all eventually finished their work, the proprietor, Takuya Kawai, said. The snug, 10-seat cafe provides unlimited self-service refills of tea and coffee, high-speed wifi, docking ports and tall chairs that positively discourage slouching or nodding off. This week, my editors asked me to put the cafe's unique selling point to the test. Would I while away my two-hour session flitting between a near-empty Word file, email and social media sites, or, as I promised Kawai, make some headway with this article? Customers must write their name, writing goals and the time they plan to finish. They can also ask Kawai to nag them about their progress. Those who ask for the 'mild' option will simply be asked how they got on when they pay at the end of the session; others in need of a heavier dose of discipline can expect him to occasionally stand behind them, although he insists he makes no value judgments on the contents of their laptop screen. The mild-mannered 52-year-old, who is a technical writer when he is not cajoling his customers to buckle down, dismissed concerns among some social media users that his tactics were heavy-handed. 'Instead of monitoring them, I'm here to support them,' he said. 'As a result, what they thought would take a day was actually completed in three hours, or tasks that usually take three hours were done in one.' Seated to my left, Shizuku Kino conceded that she was struggling. The manga artist had arrived more than two hours earlier, but had so far drawn a blank. 'It's nothing to do with the environment, I just can't come up with any good ideas at the moment. It's not that I can't concentrate ... the fact that I haven't got anything done is my problem.' Uhyou Kitami, with whom Kino has collaborated on a manga series, was faring better. 'I've made quite a lot of progress,' she said of her first visit to the cafe. 'It's not that the atmosphere inspires you ... once you sit down you have no alternative but to get on with it.' Kawai, who opened the cafe earlier this month, believes its location on the corner of a busy street is perfectly suited to unleashing torrents of creativity. 'After we opened, I played jazz to drown out the sound of people tapping their keyboards, but in fact the noise from the traffic and people outside is at just the right level for that. You don't want the absolute silence of a library or home ... here people can draw on the energy of the neighbourhood.' After initial doubts about whether the concept would work in a city packed with themed cafes, he has been taken aback by the response. 'People were pleased when they told me they had met their deadline or word count for the day. And that made me happy too.' My two hours at the cafe flew past, mercifully free of the dreaded afternoon slump. My screen was filled with a draft - albeit a very rough one - of this article. As I left, I wished Kino luck with her deadline. She turned and nodded her thanks, but her hands didn't leave her keyboard. The ideas were finally flowing.", "aae38720ce67fe4a58e958775e4953c886c5ad95d51e97fed8c69c0e": "While the United States formally recognizes a constitutional right to abortion, state-level restrictions have placed this right out of reach for many.

The Tass state news agency cites Vladimir Yermakov, the foreign ministry's head of nuclear non-proliferation, as saying all nuclear powers had a duty to stick to the logic enshrined in joint official documents aimed at avoiding nuclear war. It quotes him as saying: The official documents Yermakov refers to are a joint statement published in January by Russia, China, Britain, the US and France, in which the five countries - which are the permanent members of the UN security council - agreed that the further spread of nuclear arms and a nuclear war should be avoided. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Monday that the danger of nuclear war was 'serious', though the US then said it did not believe there was a threat of Russia using nuclear weapons despite an escalation in Moscow's rhetoric. This blog is closed - coverage of the war in Ukraine continues here. Yesterday Chinese state media published two interviews, with the foreign ministers of both Russia and Ukraine. It's an interesting decision, and one they didn't really push out on social media like they might usually with stories. China's role in the conflict as a key 'no limits' friend of Russia has been the subject of heated debate and discussion. It has put itself forward as a peacemaker but simultaneously refused to label Russia's act as an invasion, and instead blamed the US and Nato for creating and escalating tensions. Kuleba asked China to provide security guarantees for Kyiv, as well as from other permanent members of the UN Security Council, Xinhua reported.  'We propose that China becomes one of the guarantors of Ukraine's security, this is a sign of our respect and trust in the People's Republic of China.' China in 2013 pledged to provide Ukraine with 'security guarantees' if it is ever invaded or threatened with nuclear attack, but appeared evasive on the same issue in the wake of Russia's attack, according to AFP's report which also noted: Since the invasion Chinese state media has amplified Russian propaganda, refused to condemn the attack or call it an invasion, and avoided attributed Ukrainian civilian casualties to Russian forces. It's interesting then, that in publishing the interview it did not censor strong criticisms by Kuleba.  'European countries panic because they cannot guarantee Russia will not invade them tomorrow,' he said according to a translation by Politico reporter, Stuart Lau. 'If Russia is not stopped now, it will lead to more crises a few years later.' AFP notes Kuleba also accused Russia of having 'compromised' Beijing's signature Belt and Road infrastructure initiative, warning that the consequences of the global food security crisis would threaten China's economy. 'We also believe that this war is not in China's interests,' he was quoted as saying. 'The situation is not escalating because of Ukraine, we are exercising our right to defend ourselves,' he said, in an apparent rebuff of Chinese warnings against other states providing arms to Kyiv. Ukraine's Armed Forces has published an update of developments overnight. The updates were shared on Ukrainian Telegram channels. It reported Russian fire on Ukrainian troops in the Bryansk region, and air strikes and artillery fire near Slobozhansky. Russian forces were also conducting offensive operations near Izyum - Barvinkove and Izyum - Slovyansk, with about 300 weapons and pieces of equipment and about 1,000 personnel shifted in from Donetsk and Luhansk, it said. 'In the Donetsk and Tavriya directions, a group of enemy troops is taking active action along the entire section of the line of contact.' In Donetsk and Luhansk Ukrainian forces claim to have repelled nine Russian attacks in the last 24 hours, destroying eight tanks, one artillery system, twenty-four units of armoured combat vehicles, one special vehicle and five cars (including two fuel tanks). Air defence units destroyed seven UAVs and two Su-25 aircraft, it said. Reuters: Russia's defence ministry said shelling by Ukraine's forces of villages in the Kherson region has killed and injured civilians, the Russian RIA news agency reported early on Sunday.  The ministry said Ukrainian forces shelled a school, a kindergarten and a cemetery in the villages of Kyselivka and Shyroka Balka. It gave no information on how many people were killed or injured, or when the shelling took place. There was no immediate response from Ukraine to the report. Reuters could not independently verify the report. Separately, local media earlier reported that mobile internet was down in the region. The White House Correspondents' Dinner is underway, and the Ukraine conflict has already had a few mentions. First, a tribute to the numerous deaths among members of the press working on the ground. And a dig at Russian treatment of the press, by President Biden in his speech. (He's addressing comedian Trevor Noah who will follow with his own speech). US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has spoken with his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba. The pair recently met in Kyv on 24 April.  According to a readout from the US department spokesman, Ned Price, Blinken updated Kuleba on plans for US government visits to Lviv this week, and plans to return to Kyiv, ahead of an eventual return of US diplomats to the country. Blinken 'emphasised the United States' robust support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russia's brutal aggression', Price said. The two also discussed a $33 billion request by the administration to Congress, for security, economic, and humanitarian aid to 'empower Ukraine to defeat the Kremlin's unconscionable war'. Price did not provide any further details. More details here from Ukrainian president Zelenskiy's earlier video address. He said Ukrainian forces had so far destroyed about 1,000 Russian tanks, 2,500 armoured vehicles, and almost 200 aircraft. He said Russia was weakened but 'the occupiers still have equipment in stock and missiles to strike our country'. Demining work was continuing in the northern areas where Russian forces had been pushed out, he said, reporting 69% of de-occuppied settlements now had 'full-fledged local self government' back. Ukraine was in talks with partners about increasing sanctions against Russia, he said, and expected a decision on oil restrictions soon. 'If any company or state helps Russia trade oil, it must also face sanctions'. Zelenskiy also said he had recently spoken again with French president Macron about Ukraine joining the European Union, to UK prime minister Johnson about recent events, and to Swiss prime minister Cassis to thank him for the mediation role the country was serving and to discuss rebuilding. The British Foreign Office said on Sunday Russia is using a troll factory to spread disinformation about the war in Ukraine on social media and target politicians across a number of countries including Britain and South Africa, Reuters reports. Britain cited UK-funded expert research, which it did not publish. It said the research exposed how the Kremlin's disinformation campaign was designed to manipulate international public opinion of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, boost support for it and recruit new sympathisers. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a 'special operation' to disarm Ukraine and protect it from fascists. Ukraine and the West say the fascist allegation is baseless and the war is an unprovoked act of aggression. Russia says the Western media have provided an excessively partial narrative of the war that largely ignores Moscow's concerns about the enlargement of NATO and what it says is the persecution of Russian speakers in Ukraine, something denied by Kyiv. 'We cannot allow the Kremlin and its shady troll farms to invade our online spaces with their lies about Putin*s illegal war,' Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said in a statement. 'The UK Government has alerted international partners and will continue to work closely with allies and media platforms to undermine Russian information operations.' Energy giants BP and Shell are expected to report increased profits this week despite taking a big hit from the war in Ukraine, writes Rob Davies. For BP and Shell, the British companies that account for two of the world's seven oil 'supermajors', the first quarter of 2022 has been painfully fascinating. Both were heavily enmeshed in Russia and now face having to write down a combined PS24bn on the value of their businesses, after cutting ties with the Kremlin. Shell is expected to take a hit of PS3.5bn due to its decision to exit its joint venture with Gazprom, Russia's state gas giant, including its stake in the Sakhalin-2 gas project. BP accounts for the lion's share of the eye-watering sum, due to its 20% stake in state oil firm Rosneft. It seems only yesterday that BP announced it was taking the stake, in exchange for the takeover of its Russian assets by Rosneft, as part of a new alliance unveiled in a conference at the oil company's salubrious London HQ. BP boss Bob Dudley, who had himself fled Russia during a dispute with BP's partners in a former joint venture there, announced the deal in 2013 alongside his new pal Igor Sechin, then chair of Rosneft. Dudley is enjoying semi-retirement, while Sechin - nicknamed Darth Vader - sits at Putin's right hand. The result, after discussions between the government and BP, is divestment and a PS20bn hit. Rosneft accounted for PS1.9bn of profit last year. Looked at one way, that's a lot of money. Looked at another, it's practically chicken feed for a company that absorbed PS50bn of costs from its 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill and lived to tell the tale. Moreover, the loss might have been more painful if it weren't for the fact that oil companies have been making out like bandits due to sky-high oil and gas prices.

", "019a65c11d7b5b6d731449405acdf7cc282e650e622ff9db42d9df82": "In the woods on a roadside near Borodianka, 40 miles from Kyiv, police were overseeing the exhumation of two men who were executed and buried next to what locals say was a Russian military checkpoint. Alongside the officers were four men in civilian clothing wearing gardening gloves - ordinary Ukrainians with no previous experience of this gut-wrenching work who have become volunteers collecting the hundreds of bodies still being dug up in towns bordering the capital. It has been a month since the Ukrainian army pushed Russian forces out of Kyiv region, yet local police and volunteers are still finding new graves. More than 1,000 bodies have been recovered there according to Ukrainian prosecutors, who said many more people were killed by bombs, making their remains hard to find. The police forces of small towns and quiet villages have been plunged into investigating one of the largest atrocities in Europe in recent times. Amid the unfathomable scale of this endeavour, officers are relying on ordinary Ukrainians to do the heavy lifting while they take statements and document the deaths. The volunteer body collectors are tasked with picking up rotting and often mutilated bodies from the graves, putting them in body bags, numbering them and then, at the end of each day, driving the total number of bodies collected to whichever morgue in Kyiv region has room. 'I didn't know this is what we'd be doing,' said Vasily Pasieka, a middle-aged driver for a construction company in Chernivtsi region, western Ukraine, who was driving the van which carries the bodies. 'But someone has to do it for the relatives, for the police.' 'I am a simple driver. I've been behind the wheel for 40 years,' said Pasieka. Their employer, Mekhtransbud, wanted to do something to help when they saw the news about the mass atrocities in Kyiv region. They called one of the improvised humanitarian aid centres, who said they needed a van and manpower. Pasieka and his colleague Serhiy Roholsky volunteered to go to the region with one of the company's vans. The company, they said, was paying for their stay at a hotel while they volunteered. 'We pick up between 8 to 11 bodies a day,' said Roholsky, who said they had only been working in the small town of Borodianka and its surrounding villages since they arrived two weeks ago. Roholsky had just picked up two bodies from a dug-up grave in the woods and placed them on a path with the help of two other male volunteers in their early twenties. 'Every day it's different but we find all sorts - men, women, young, old, middle-aged.' One of the two bodies was a pension-aged man whose head had been severed, the whereabouts of which is still unknown. Both corpses were twisted and mangled. It looked as though their limbs had been broken in several places. The son of the man whose head had been severed, Serhiy Kubitsky, was there to witness the exhumation and give a statement to the police. He and his family had left the village for the safety of western Ukraine when the war started, but his father had not wanted to leave. 'I didn't believe it was him when they told me,' said Kubitsky. He said that his neighbours found his father's body in the woods near the Russian checkpoint on 17 March and buried him on the spot. The neighbours then returned to the grave yesterday to dig it up under police supervision. 'Then they showed me his documents,' said Kubitsky. In the trunk of his car were the spades used by his neighbours to exhume the bodies. Every day, Pasieka and Roholsky go from their hotel to the humanitarian aid centre where their company's van is refuelled, then they pick up two new volunteers to help them collect the bodies. Even amid the daily hell of the task, the two worst instances in the relatively small area of Kyiv region where they have been volunteering, Roholsky said, were when a 15-year-old girl was exhumed from a mass grave near the town's GP surgery and when they dug up the body of an elderly man who had been doused in petrol and set alight. The witness who recounted the story to Roholsky was the elderly man's wife, who said she had been tied up by Russian soldiers and forced to watch. After the two men in the woods , the next stop was the cemetery of a nearby village, where the team were to dig up two buried bodies in order to register the cause of death. Stanislav Kozynchuk, the deputy head of the Kyiv region prosecutor's office, said the two people who had been buried in the cemetery were killed by airstrikes, which he had reason to believe may have used clusters bombs. Evidence collected by the Guardian during visits to Bucha, Hostomel and Borodianka - and reviewed by independent weapons experts - showed that Russian troops had used cluster bombs, which are widely banned across the world, as well as extremely powerful unguided bombs, which are not permitted for use in populated areas and are responsible for the destruction of several blocks of flats in Kyiv region. At the cemetery, one of the victims' wives, Alla Kuzmenko, said that her husband had gone out to help neighbours after a bomb hit a house across the road. She started following him but turned back to put the dog in the house when a second bomb hit and killed him. 'My dog likes to run between people's legs, I didn't want her to be running riot,' said Kuzmenko. Deputy prosecutor Kozynchuk said that all bodies not buried according to the law needed to be exhumed and examined until every cause of death was determined by a forensic doctor after an autopsy - only after that could such bodies be buried. 'Because of war, there was no chance to do the autopsies, the civilians just buried the body and later reported to the police the location of the grave. It doesn't matter whether the body was buried in a cemetery or somewhere in a field, if it wasn't documented it has to be exhumed,'' said Kozynchuk. 'It is essential that all bodies are exhumed and identified so that victims' families can be informed, and the exact causes of death established,' Michelle Bachelet, the UN high commissioner for human rights, has said. 'All measures should be taken to preserve evidence.'", "45fa3512699aa9b0c51eaded02b586eb11ca1f781770bf2ae9daee99": "Headteacher Natalia Palczynska was in a state of shock after the heating and hot water at her primary school went off without warning on Wednesday. 'We were completely taken aback,' she said. Unless the gas starts flowing again soon, she said, 'we'll have no choice but to close our doors until it does'. The school, in Miescisko, a village in western Poland, was in one of about 10 administrative districts in which homes, health centres, kindergartens and local businesses - as well as thousands of residents - lost heating after Moscow halted gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria at 8am on Wednesday. The affected area was relatively small, and unusual in that it was solely dependent on Russia for gas. But it was seen as an indication as to what could happen on a wider scale if Moscow turned off supplies to countries far more dependent than Poland which, while it gets 40% of its gas needs from Russia, only uses gas for 9% of its energy requirements. Mateusz Morawiecki, the prime minister, complained of a 'direct attack', accusing Russia of 'putting a pistol to our heads', but said Poland would 'manage so that the Polish people will not feel any change', and urging Poles in a televised address: 'please don't be afraid'. But in Miescisko at least, the fear was palpable. The phones of the mayor's office were ringing constantly as residents called in to say they had been, as one local woman told Polish TV, 'shut down by Putin'. The Kremlin said it had halted supplies because of Warsaw and Sofia's failure to respond to its demand to pay for gas in roubles. The two EU members, which are among the most vocal supporters of a swift withdrawal from Russian gas, said they would not give in to blackmail and that the provocative step was one they could handle. But it has pushed Europe to the brink of an energy crisis, prompting a 20% increase in the already rising wholesale gas price. There is anxiety that Russia could do the same elsewhere, such as to Gazprom's most important customer in Europe, Germany - which takes 55% of its gas from Russia and has paid it EUR5bn for gas and oil since the start of the Ukraine conflict - or to others, such as Italy, Finland, Croatia or Latvia, which are also heavily reliant on Moscow. Industry in Poland is putting on a brave face. 'We are quite well prepared for this,' said Tomasz Zielinski, president of the board of the Polish Chamber of Chemical Industry, which represents about 13,000 businesses and more than 320,000 jobs. In his office in downtown Warsaw, he cited the fact that Poland's gas storage facilities were 76% full, compared with an EU average of only 30% (33% in Germany). The government had spent years working with businesses to reduce their dependency on Russia, he said. In 2015 a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal was opened in the north-west port city of Swinoujscie, close to the German border, capable of covering a quarter of Poland's gas needs. It is being extended to increase intake by about 10%. Shots of its yellow, snaking pipes have frequently provided the backdrop for recent TV reports and government interviews in which attempts are made to reassure Poles. It has become something of a symbol of the nation's hope in bezpieczenstwo energetyczne (energy security), the new buzz phrase. This autumn, the much-hailed Baltic pipeline, viewed as a response to the German-Russian Nord Steam 2 project, is scheduled to go into operation. Running from Norway through Denmark to Poland, it will be able to carry about 10 billion cubic metres of gas every year, about half of the national requirements. Another pipeline nearing completion will connect Poland to the LNG terminal in the Lithuanian port city of Klaipeda, and existing pipelines connect Poland with Germany and the Czech Republic. 'Poland was not surprised by what's happened, it was something that was always expected,' said Joanna Mackowiak-Pandera, head of Forum Energii, an NGO spanning business, administration and science, which focuses on energy transition. She hoped it might speed up Poland's slow decarbonisation efforts not least, she said, because 'it's now clear to most people that sales of fossil fuels have literally fuelled Russian aggression'. The image being projected by business and politics may be one of stoicism, and it has helped to unify a polarised country, but 'the atmosphere is extremely nervous', she said. Interview requests to 12 manufacturers highly reliant on gas, from glass to cardboard producers, were rejected, with one admitting the 'issue is right now too delicate' to talk about. The government has downplayed Poland's dependence on Russian coal, said Mackowiak-Pandera, which supplements inadequate domestic supplies and is used to heat a large percentage of Polish homes. 'Only recently have people become aware that it's Russian coal that gives us our dirty air and there is a lot of pressure to stop this,' she said. 'In a way, this is more significant for us than the gas issue.' She asked whether the national drive for derusyfikacja  (de-Russification) would push the issue of dekarbonizacja (decarbonisation) down the agenda, further increasing the demand for coal, or - as she hoped - help to wean Poland off it. Support for phasing out Russian coal is high - 94% of citizens in a recent poll said they were ready to pay more in order to switch from Russian supplies. 'But no one says how much they would be prepared to pay,' she said. Household coal prices have already risen by 300% in the past year. 'So, as a consequence, we expect to see a lot of energy poverty this coming winter.'  There is speculation that the frenzied effort to meet the rising demand for coal may have caused two deadly explosions last week at mines in Silesia, southern Poland, killing 18 miners, while seven others are still missing. Bernard Swoczyna, a power engineer with the progressive thinktank Instrat, said that while he could not but be shocked by the events that have driven it, 'a dramatic shifting of the window of discourse is taking place in Poland right now'. The idea of 'diverting from fossil fuels from Russia was until recently a fringe idea, and now it's viewed as a baseline scenario', he said. Poland has spent years telling its neighbours Europe must move away from Russian supplies. The word niepodleglosc (independence) has a deeply emotional meaning linked to Poland's past under the yoke of foreign powers, most recently the Soviet Union. Nowadays it is often used in relation to the energy debate. History means that trust towards Russia was low from the outset, but everyday experience did not help. Over the past 18 years, Russian gas stopped flowing at least seven times, sometimes for a few days, once for half a year. 'We were keen to be independent, for which we were sometimes accused of being Russophobe, particularly by German politicians. But this idea never flew in the financial markets, because the low price was the driving force,' Mackowiak-Pandera said. Pawel Rozynski, an economic commentator in the conservative daily, Rzeczpospolita, said Russia was 'like Pablo Escoabar'. 'Gas was like our drug and turned out to be very addictive because it was cheap, efficient and more ecological than other sources of energy. Poland has been forced to get sober very fast ... but we have lost a lot of time defending coal because we thought it protected our sovereignty ... and one of the side-effects will be much higher energy costs.' For Wojciech Mroz, the cut is most important from a moral and ethical point of view. The 24-year-old student of spatial economics, who runs his own payment start-up, Pagaspot, has been at the forefront of efforts through a Catholic youth organisation to help some of the three million Ukrainian refugees who, border police report, have arrived in Poland since the start of the war. About 20,000-25,000 people still arrive each day, and the numbers are not expected to stop any time soon. 'It's a good thing this has happened now as it saves our government from having to take this step themselves. And even if it won't end the war, if we had kept taking the gas, it would not have stood well next to Poland's huge national effort to help Ukrainian refugees and to save lives,' he said. Maks De Doliwa Zielinski, 23, an economics student from Krakow, whose recent plans to take up a job with a German chemicals company in eastern Ukraine were scuppered by the war, said the situation was causing friction at home. 'My father, a businessman, said we and Europe made a mistake by trusting Russia at all. We never should have.' His German mother, he said, thinks otherwise, arguing that Germany had nursed the naive hope of helping Russia move to a democracy through its close trade ties, (the Wandel durch Handel - or 'change through trade' policy). 'Poland was screaming at the Germans for a long time about the need to diversify, saying Russia was too unpredictable. But as we can see now, business has driven politics into a dark corner.'", "f7770837d78e8e4fa850da852c08a83f76b1eaf8a1e912af7fd03413": "", "c2fd1aaf8fd4758e0b41829664b6010790b932bab1f0e03088f36b8c": "", "13033a85b7b8e6a0f6eb77d6f9a95cdc7444ede802785eaafc9c4bec": "Facebook moderators have called on the company to let them take action against users who praise or support the Russian military's atrocities in Bucha and across Ukraine. Almost a month after evidence of widespread murder and mass graves was uncovered by Ukrainian forces taking the suburb of Kyiv, the social network still has not flagged the atrocity as an 'internally designated' incident, the moderators say. That restricts how they can treat content related to the killings, they say, and forces them to leave up some content they believe ought to be removed. 'It's been a month since the massacre and mass graves in Bucha, but this event hasn't been even designated a 'violating event', let alone a hate crime,' said one moderator, who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity. 'On that same day there was a shooting in the US, with one fatality and two casualties, and this was declared a violating event within three hours.' Under Facebook's public moderation guidelines, users are barred from posting content that makes violent threats through 'references to historical or fictional incidents of violence'. But in private documents issued to moderators, who work for third-party contracting firms such as Accenture or Bertelsmann, they are told to wait for regional input from Facebook itself before determining whether a 'documented violent incident' counts. In the absence of that input, content that praises events in Bucha is tough to remove if it's even slightly coy about whether it's celebrating the murder of people. One post, for instance, showed a T-shirt featuring a butcher carving up a pig, with Russian text on it reading 'ReZnia v Buche Mozhem poVtorit'' - 'Slaughter in Bucha, we can repeat'. 'My suspicion is that this is just not as close, not as important to American audiences or the American public, so it just doesn't get the attention,' the Facebook moderator said. 'After two weeks I realised that they probably aren't going to do anything about it. 'I was quite happy with the initial reaction of Facebook to the war,' they added. 'I was quite happy with the exceptions that were made that allowed dehumanising speech against soldiers. Those changes brought some balance into the policies: victims and oppressors were not treated the same and were not given the same rights. But now, it has become clear that what counts for Facebook is American public opinion. They only care if they look good in the US media.' In a statement, a spokesperson for Meta, Facebook's parent company, said: 'It's wrong to suggest we wouldn't remove graphic content that celebrates or glorifies the atrocities in Bucha, or any post that mocks the death of individual victims or advocates for violence against Ukrainians in any way. 'We've longstanding policies that make clear this content is not allowed on Facebook and Instagram,' they added. 'We have been providing additional guidance to content reviewers on these policies and content associated with the war in Ukraine to explain how our policies apply in the current context, and will continue to do so.' State use of force is treated differently to criminal acts of violence under its policies, Facebook said, based on extensive consultations with outside experts. The issue was raised by the nonprofit campaign group Foxglove Legal. Its director, Martha Dark, said: 'Facebook can act swiftly on mass killings when it wants to. In the US, for example, mass shootings tend to be classed within hours as a 'violating event' - this blocks posters from praising the murders, celebrating the perpetrators, or calling for more violence. 'The Bucha massacre happened a month ago. Facebook has a simple policy it could adapt to end this now. It just can't be bothered. Facebook will claim for the hundredth time that it 'takes these matters seriously' and is 'working closely with moderators' to fix them. That's just spin from a tech giant that cares only about the bottom line.'", "ca5084ad36f5209d76d54fdfb15239d33dafb4a03b7f749db7f9af9d": "The Foreign Office is risking a political backlash on the British Virgin Islands if it goes ahead with plans recommended by an independent commission of inquiry to impose a form of direct rule on the islands from London after allegations of maladministration and corruption. Natalio Wheatley, the acting BVI premier elevated to the office after the former premier Andrew Fahie, 51, was arrested on drug running charges in Miami on Thursday, said he opposed the plan for direct rule for two years, with the British appointed governor taking charge and being advised by a council of local politicians. Fahie was arrested after an undercover operation conducted by the US Drug Enforcement Agency. Foreign Office minister Amanda Milling is due to arrive at the islands shortly where she will hold talks before the Foreign Office makes a decision on direct rule next week. Wheatley is from the same party as the former premier, but is seen as independent of him. His objections to direct rule have the support of the opposition party, so the UK must decide how to set about reform of BVI governance if the elected assembly and government retain existing powers over domestic policy. An inquiry into corruption in the territory, led by Sir Gary Hickinbottom, whose report was hurriedly published by the Foreign Office in the immediate wake of the premier's shock arrest, argued direct rule is necessary because the allegations of systematic rule-breaking, stretching back over one or more administrations, were so serious that time was needed for constitutional reform to be introduced, and investigations to be held into specific examples of corruption. But the retired judge submitted his report, including this recommendation, on 4 April, with what he said was a heavy heart on the assumption that Fahie would still be in office. Arguably, his detention in a jail in Miami, along with the head of the BVI Ports Authority, Oleanvine Maynard, will weaken any Fahie allies who wished to block reforms or specific corruption investigations. Fahie, according to a DEA affidavit, had boasted he used his powers of office to protect his allies. Fahie was also resisting plans to introduce a public register of beneficial ownership, a means of lifting the veil of secrecy over the BVI's tax haven status. The Foreign Office believes corruption on the islands is linked more to drugs than money laundering. Yet more than half the shell companies identified in the Panama Papers are registered in the BVI, Hickinbottom's report found. In an address on Facebook, Wheatley said he was gravely concerned by the anchor of the Hickinbottom recommendations - the partial suspension of the constitution and direct rule by the UK for at least two years. 'What this would mean in real terms is that there would no longer be elected representatives who represent the people of the districts and the territory in the house of assembly where laws are made for our society. There would be no government ministers to advance the public priorities or a cabinet to approve a policy. All of that authority would be invested in the governor. 'The benefit of representative democracy to the public is the understanding and responsiveness of the elected representatives to their challenges and also to serve as conduits of their views, especially on reforms.' Hickinbottom had proposed an ad hoc council be formed to advise the governor. Wheatley said the strengthening of the system of BVI government 'can be achieved without the partial or full suspension of the constitution'. He said extraordinary powers exist under the constitution that can be exercised if necessary and, in an olive branch to London, said he recognised that the governor had a duty to ensure the security of the territory, acknowledging he has authority to mount the necessary criminal investigations. Proposing an alternative path, Wheatley said: 'What is in the best interest is an enhanced cooperation mechanism to impose the reforms under a tight timetable without resorting to direct rule.' He said there were already signs of a better partnership between the elected cabinet and the governor, pointing to the progress BVI and the UK had made in imposing sanctions in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. However, the inquiry found that elected officials 'can and do make decisions - which expend huge sums of public money and affect the lives of all those who live in the [British Virgin Islands] - as they wish, without applying any objective criteria, without giving any reasons and without fearing any comeback'. The report said these decisions include matters such as procurement of contracts, selling crown land and grants of residence. Also highlighted was the scale of police corruption; the report pointed out that in November 2020, in a single operation, the Royal Virgin Islands police force seized 2.353 tons of cocaine from the home of a serving police officer who is currently under arrest. At the time the chief of police gave his evidence to the inquiry, 'the RVIPF had nine officers suspended for various offences, including not only possession with intent to supply, but also possession of an unlicensed firearm, making obscene publications, handling stolen goods and indecent assault'. The string of islands inhabited by 35,000 people, east of Puerto Rico, operates under a 2007 constitution that gives the islands limited self-governance under a governor who is the ultimate executive authority as the representative of the Queen.", "2fe89e68ec9def11be253dcaa705365d8b719e0e703df78fbe8d206a": "Twitter's chief executive, Parag Agrawal, sought to quell employee anger on Friday during a company-wide meeting where employees demanded answers to how managers planned to handle an anticipated mass exodus prompted by Elon Musk. The meeting comes after Musk, the Tesla chief executive who sealed a $44bn deal to buy the social media company, repeatedly criticized Twitter's content moderation practices and a top executive responsible for setting speech and safety policies. At the internal town hall meeting, executives said the company would monitor staff attrition daily, but it was too soon to tell how the buyout deal with Musk would affect staff retention. Musk has pitched lenders on slashing board and executive salaries but exact cost cuts remain unclear, according to sources familiar with the matter. One source said Musk would not make decisions on job cuts until he assumed ownership of Twitter. 'I'm tired of hearing about shareholder value and fiduciary duty. What are your honest thoughts about the very high likelihood that many employees will not have jobs after the deal closes?' one Twitter employee asked Agrawal, in a question read aloud during the meeting. Agrawal answered that Twitter had always cared about its employees and would continue to do so. 'I believe the future Twitter organization will continue to care about its impact on the world and its customers,' he said. Executives said during the meeting that the employee attrition rate had not changed compared to the levels before the news of Musk's interest in buying the company. In recent days, Musk has tweeted criticism of Twitter's top lawyer, Vijaya Gadde, a Twitter veteran widely respected across Silicon Valley and internally known as Twitter's 'moral authority'. On Monday, Gadde was reported to have cried during a virtual meeting with the company's legal and policy teams as she expressed concerns over the trajectory of the company. In response to the YouTuber Saajar Enjeti's tweet about the company's 'top censorship advocate' who once censored the New York Post for a story on Hunter Biden's laptop contents, Musk tweeted: 'Suspending the Twitter account of a major news organization for publishing a truthful story was obviously incredibly inappropriate.' Musk's attack triggered a barrage of online harassment targeting Gadde. Users took aim at Gadde, tweeting: 'Just quit you scum' and 'WHITE POWER! WHITE PRIDE!' Earlier this week, Musk also pushed for end-to-end encryption on the social media platform, prompting concerns among users and lawmakers who fear that such protections may make it easier for extremists and criminals to operate online. 'Twitter DMs should have end to end encryption like Signal, so no one can spy on or hack your messages,' he tweeted on Wednesday. Employees told executives they feared Musk's erratic behavior could destabilize Twitter's business and hurt it financially as the company prepares to address the advertising world in a presentation next week in New York City. 'Do we have a strategy in the near-term on how to handle advertisers pulling investment?' one employee asked. Sarah Personette, Twitter's chief customer officer, said the company was working to communicate frequently with advertisers and reassure them 'the way that we service our customers is not changing'. After the meeting, a Twitter employee told Reuters there was little trust in what executives had to say. 'The PR speak is not landing. They told us don't leak and do a job you are proud of, but there is no clear incentive for employees to do this,' the employee told Reuters, noting that compensation for non-executive staffers was now capped because of the deal. Agrawal was expected to receive an estimated $42m if he were terminated within 12 months of a change in control at the social media company, according to the research firm Equilar. During the meeting, Agrawal urged staff to expect change in the future under new leadership and acknowledged that the company could have performed better over the years. 'Yes, we could have done things differently and better. I could have done things differently. I think about that a lot,' he said. On Friday, Twitter's co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey used the platform to write: 'I have tried taking a break from Twitter recently, but I must say: the company has always tried to do its best given the information it had. Every decision we made was ultimately my responsibility*. In the cases we were wrong or went too far, we admitted it and worked to correct.' He added: 'A transparent system, both in policy and operations, is the right way to earn trust. Whether it's owned by a company or an open protocol doesn't matter _as much as_ deliberately deciding to be open about every decision and why it was made. It's not easy to do, but it must happen.' Dorsey also wrote that he did not believe that permanent bans were right, with the exception of those involving criminal activity. 'This is why we need a protocol that's resilient to the layers above,' he explained. Twitter declined further comment.

Appearing on the Newsmax television channel, Barr said Trump, who has hinted that he will run again, would not be a sound choice. 'I don't think he should be our nominee - the Republican party nominee,' Barr said. 'And I think Republicans have a big opportunity - it would be a big mistake to put him forward.' In a poll in January 57% of Republican voters said they would choose Trump in 2024. Trump also won the less scientific Conservative Political Action Conference straw poll, in February, by a large margin. Trump, who was impeached twice during his four years in the White House, has repeatedly teased his supporters with suggestions he will run again. 'We did it twice, and we'll do it again,' Trump told a crowd at the CPAC convention - claiming again that he won the 2020 election. 'We're going to be doing it again a third time.' Still, Barr's remarks will be sure to anger Trump, who has repeatedly clashed with his former attorney general since losing the 2020 election. In Barr's book, One Damn Thing After Another: Memoirs of an Attorney General, he wrote that Trump had 'shown he has neither the temperament nor persuasive powers to provide the kind of positive leadership that is needed'. Trump, Barr said, has surrounded himself with 'sycophants' and 'whack jobs from outside the government, who fed him a steady diet of comforting but unsupported conspiracy theories'. Trump responded by calling Barr 'slow' and 'lethargic'. 'When the Radical Left Democrats threatened to Hold him in contempt and even worse, Impeach him, he became virtually worthless to Law and Order and Election Integrity. They broke him just like a trainer breaks a horse.' Trump had previously called Barr a 'swamp creature' and a 'Rino [Republican in Name Only] ... afraid, weak and frankly ... pathetic'.", "b16fd8f6e691983110ea76f84579cb29e26e0c6e82b487863d8154d5": "The senior Conservative MP under investigation for allegedly watching pornography on his phone in the House of Commons chamber has suggested he may have opened it accidentally but has rejected calls to stand down as an MP immediately. Neil Parish, the MP for Tiverton and Honiton in Devon, had the whip suspended after becoming the fourth MP from his party since the last election to face claims of impropriety. Parish revealed he had referred himself to the standards commissioner on Friday afternoon after senior Tory women expressed outrage at the party for failing to act on complaints made earlier this week, despite being aware of his identity. In a statement, the 65-year-old wrote on his website: 'I will be cooperating fully with any investigation, and whilst it is ongoing I will continue to perform my duties as MP for Tiverton and Honiton.'  Asked later by broadcasters if he had opened something in error in the Commons, he said: 'I did, but let the inquiry look at that.' However, there were suggestions that a Tory minister also saw him watching porn on a second occasion, in a committee meeting. Parish said he would consider his position as an MP after the result of the investigation, telling reporters: 'I will not remain if I am found guilty.' His wife, Sue Parish, told the Times the accusations were 'all very embarrassing', adding: 'My breath was taken away, frankly. 'People shouldn't be looking at pornography. He would never just sit there with people looking. He would never just do that knowing [people were looking]. These ladies were quite right to be as [upset] as they were.' Describing her husband as a 'normal ... lovely person', she added: 'If you were mad with every man who looked at pornography, you would not have many wives in the world. 'It's degrading. It's demeaning. But on the other hand it takes two to tango. There must be women posing for all this.' When asked what the accusations could mean for her husband's career, she replied: 'I've got no idea. It depends on what Chris Heaton-Harris [the Tory chief whip] says, I suppose. I don't think it's going to carry on, is it? It's so stupid. He's such a good MP. He's such a good person.' Labour accused the Tory whips of trying to 'cover up' for Parish before finally deciding to withdraw the whip on Friday. If found to have brought the Commons into disrepute, Parish could be sanctioned and face the possibility of a recall petition, potentially triggering a byelection, if suspended from parliament for more than 10 days. Allegations of a porn-watching parliamentarian were first aired by Tory MPs in a meeting with Heaton-Harris, the party's chief whip, on Tuesday. Heaton-Harris suspended Parish, who has represented his constituency since 2010, from the parliamentary Conservative party pending the outcome of an investigation after they spoke on Friday afternoon. Harriet Harman told the BBC Radio 4 PM programme that Parish should stand down as an MP. 'This marks a new low for the House of Commons,' the senior Labour MP said. 'It is not right for him to go through the investigation processes if that is what he has done. Clearly he is not fit to be in parliament. He should accept that and not drag the processes out.' It was understood that the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS), which looks into claims of bullying and sexual harassment, had begun examining events after at least one witness made a referral. A second investigation could be launched after Parish's commitment to refer himself to Kathryn Stone, , the independent parliamentary commissioner for standards, who may consider whether Parish broke the MPs' code of conduct by causing 'significant damage to the reputation and integrity' of the Commons. Parish gave an interview to GB News this week in which he was asked about allegations of a then unidentified Tory MP watching pornography in the Commons. 'I think the whips' office will do a thorough investigation and we will wait and see that result and from that, then the decision will have to be made what action will be taken,' he said. Pressed on whether there was a problem with the culture at Westminster, Parish said: 'We've got some 650 members of parliament in what is a very intense area. You are going to get people who step over the line. It does have to be dealt with and dealt with seriously.'", "a90fc2b808726cc6d97f89321ed8ded97b20f5a29fa587e44d29852a": "Fans and followers of Theranos and its founder Elizabeth Holmes can now take home an expensive original piece of the company. On eBay, more than a dozen allegedly authentic products from the now-defunct Silicon Valley firm are being sold - and much like the company itself, are listed at inflated prices. A set of five Theranos branded pens recently sold for $150. A water bottle is currently listed for $1,500. For $11,000, you can purchase an 'authentic' Theranos lab coat (notably 'never worn'). Many of these products are typical of Silicon Valley firms, which are known to hand out branded pens, shirts and water bottles at conferences. But the demand for those emblazoned with the 'Theranos' logo have soared following the company's spectacular downfall. Holmes was convicted in January on four of 11 charges of fraud following a weeks-long trial chronicling her role in the blood testing firm. The trial attracted massive attention, but months after the verdict was read, the hype has not waned. A Hulu television series has drawn major viewership, a movie is in the works, and the trial of Holmes co-conspirator Sunny Balwani is currently underway. 'We are seeing a ton of interest following the Holmes trial, and I don't think it's going to go away,' said Aron Solomon, a chief legal analyst for legal marketing firm Esquire Digital who has followed Theranos extensively. The fascination with Holmes has created a micro-industry for new and vintage Theranos merch. And former employees are cashing in. John, a seller behind one account listing Theranos products, worked at the company from 2012 to 2018 and was left with a handful of merchandise. 'I heard people were buying stuff online, so I listed some old clothes I had, kind of as a joke,' said John, who asked to be quoted by pseudonym due to privacy concerns. 'But they sold for outrageous amounts of money.' John worked in manufacturing and - like many at Theranos - was largely unaware of the issues being experienced with lab testing until it was too late. 'We were pretty oblivious to what was going on,' he said. He said he lost his job when the company collapsed. After months of trying to find new employment, he gave up and retired early. He has made more than $1,200 reselling his old Theranos gear, but said it is little consolation. 'I had stock options, so it would have been much better for me if the company had not been a lie and had actually produced something,' he said. Solomon, the analyst, said the prices for Theranos gear is owed more to the enduring fascination with Holmes herself than with the former company . 'People were infinitely fascinated by her as a character,' he said. 'It has become a cultural phenomenon, and that's never going to change.' Indeed, Holmes's co-conspirator and former romantic partner Balwani is currently facing a jury in the same courtroom where Holmes stood trial. But the proceedings have garnered a substantially smaller following. 'This college dropout wearing a black turtleneck who managed to rip off Henry Kissinger - it's become a cultural obsession,' Solomon said. 'Nobody would ever collect Sunny Balwani merchandise.'", "545fc6d810b537f9b37fa6bc376a58c356015653398a8231e7cf60f9": "Rebel Conservative MPs fear Boris Johnson could gamble on a general election within months in a make-or-break bid to save his premiership - but the party chairman, Oliver Dowden, has privately dismissed the idea as electorally disastrous. One MP hoping to oust Johnson said they are 'deadly serious' in their belief that the prime minister could seek to win himself another term by calling a vote this autumn, especially if he manages to buy time in No 10 by winning a confidence vote before the summer. Some of his critics are convinced that the threshold of 54 Tory MPs required to trigger a confidence vote could be crossed shortly after further expected fines over the Partygate scandal, a bad result in next week's local elections or the probable loss of the marginal Wakefield seat in its upcoming byelection. However, they think Johnson stands a good chance of winning a vote requiring the support of more than 50% of his MPs - giving him a year's reprieve before he can face another. One Conservative MP said Dowden had been dampening down speculation of an early general election by privately reassuring colleagues there is 'no way' they would go to the polls when Johnson's ratings are so poor and Labour are several points ahead. But the MP also argued that if Johnson faces a serious choice between being ousted by his own party and putting himself to a vote of the general public, many believe he would choose the latter. 'He could try to run another anti-establishment campaign pitching himself against MPs in parliament, that's what we most fear,' they said. Another Tory MP, who wants Johnson to go, said there was nervousness on the backbenches, particularly among so-called red wall MPs, that Johnson's 'self-interest' and reputation as a risk-taker could lead him to bet on an election. One senior party source insisted an autumn election was 'not the working assumption' and highlighted forthcoming boundary changes, which are expected to benefit the Tories and would not come into force until 2023. But they added: 'One thing that is always a good idea is to try and maintain a wide range of options.' More than 6,800 seats in 200 councils across Britain are up for grabs in next week's local elections, including every seat in London, Scotland and Wales. Both main parties are playing down their prospects, with Labour pointing to their strong showing the last time these seats were contested in 2018, and the Conservatives highlighting the fact they are trailing in national polls. Tory strategists claim they are in serious trouble in the flagship London councils of Wandsworth and Westminster. Labour insist these remain unlikely targets, but have hopes of taking Barnet, in north London, which has been mainly Tory-controlled since it was formed in 1964 (with a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition ruling between 1994 and 2002). Outside the capital, the Tories hope to make gains in places such Sandwell in the West Midlands, where they took parliamentary seats at the 2019 general election but are well behind Labour at council level. Conservative MPs will be watching developments in their constituencies closely, with advances for the opposition parties pointing to potential trouble at a future general election. A senior Tory party source played down the risk that this could translate into fresh trouble for Johnson, however, saying: 'It's well known local elections can be used as a protest vote.' The Liberal Democrats had made modest gains in disgraced former MP Owen Paterson's North Shropshire seat at recent local elections, before overturning a near-23,000 majority to oust the Conservatives last year. Labour sources say their number-crunchers will be monitoring the council results particularly closely in 50 key parliamentary seats the party believes it needs to gain in order to win the next election - including Stevenage, Bury North and South, and Glasgow. 'If we have a night where we're showing the right kind of progress in the sort of places where we need to win at the next election, that's good for us,' they said, adding that Labour will also be happy if Tory MPs continue to procrastinate about Johnson's future, given his poor personal ratings. Dowden told Conservative activists at his party's spring conference in Blackpool that Johnson saw these local elections as the start of a two-year campaign, building up to the next general election. The prime minister told reporters en route to India on his recent trip that he fully intends to fight the next general election, and could not imagine resigning over the Downing Street parties scandal. But some backbenchers are concerned the government appears to be running out of ideas. A cabinet brainstorming session about the cost of living earlier this week resulting in few concrete ideas aside from making MOTs two-yearly - a plan swiftly rejected by motorists' group the AA. Meanwhile the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, appeared to be flirting with the Labour policy of a windfall tax on energy companies this week, after repeatedly rejecting it.  This article was amended on 30 April 2022 to remove a reference to the Conservatives hoping to make gains in Stoke-on-Trent, as local elections are not taking place there.

The price increases, she said, were forcing her to choose among necessities for her and four kids. 'What am I going to do? Prices are up everywhere, all over town,' she said. 'I can't afford everything.' But while Holmes struggles, Dollar Tree thrives. The retailer increased its prices by 25% as profits jumped 269% between 2019 and 2021, and its profit margins widened. Shareholders won too. The company also announced a stock buyback program worth $1bn that will deliver cash from those price increases to its investors. Dollar Tree and other large corporations are juicing profits by passing on higher-than-needed price increases to customers like Holmes under the cover of inflation, war and supply chain squeezes, consumer advocates and economists say. They are calling for the federal government to take bold steps to rein in the companies. Among proposed prescriptions are price controls, improved price fixing rules, commodity market intervention, stock buyback regulation and antitrust enforcement. Ranged against those proposals are a powerful business lobby and a divided Congress that seems unable to pass major legislation. 'There are reasons to have a profit incentive, but there are also reasons to have an overall regulatory body that can say, 'This is actually profiteering ... while everyone is hurting,'' said Krista Brown, a policy analyst with the American Economic Liberties Project. A Guardian analysis of 100 top corporations' Securities Exchange Commission filings found a median increase of 49% in profits between the most recent quarter and the same quarter two years ago, pre-pandemic. It shows companies have largely shielded themselves from inflationary pain by passing most or all of their increased costs on to customers via price hikes. So far, the federal government's most visible attempt to address inflation has been to increase interest rates, rates look set to rise again this week. But the Guardian's data suggests such a measure may miss an important mark. Raising rates effectively takes money out of consumers' pockets to cool the economy. If corporate profits are contributing in a meaningful way, then raising rates would only reduce the amount of money people have to spend on products and services for which prices are still going up. 'That would mean you're exacerbating this dynamic instead of doing anything to help it,' said Isabella Weber, University of Massachusetts Amherst economist. Instead, limited and targeted price controls could work for essentials like bread, some experts have suggested. Though price controls are controversial and generally regarded as a leftist idea, the last president to enact them was Richard Nixon, who imposed a 90-day freeze on wages and prices to address inflation in 1970. Price controls were also enacted during and following the second world war, when, again, supply chain issues and pent up demand led to soaring prices. But price rises are not the only issue critics would like to see the Biden administration address. Others, like Groundwork Collaborative's executive director, Lindsay Owens, have called for a ban or new restrictions on stock buyback programs. Joe Biden's 2023 budget proposes prohibiting executives from selling their stock three to five years after enacting a buyback program. 'The other big winner besides the shareholders in excess cash that's going to buybacks are the executives,' Owens said. 'They announce the buybacks, their stock prices soar, then they sell their shares and there are a number of ways to make this work better.' The Guardian's analysis found companies' buyback programs over the last 15 months totaled $544bn. That cash could have been reinvested to keep prices down, or increase workers' wages, consumer advocates say. Others levelled accusations of price fixing and gouging. The American Economic Liberties Project is helping draft legislation that would make it easier for businesses to sue companies for price fixing by making private corporate communications more accessible.  'Reinvigorating price fixing laws and going after price gouging in moments like this, where a war or Covid are used as excuses for companies to raise rates just because they can, could help a lot,' she added. Fixing is especially a problem in highly consolidated industries, consumer advocates say. Companies have benefited from 'decades long under-enforcement of consolidation laws', added Martin Schmalz, an Oxford University economist. Just four companies control most of the US beef industry, four airlines control about 80% of domestic passenger traffic, Walmart accounts for the majority of grocery sales in the majority of US states, the list goes on and on. And it's not just the companies that have outsized control. Large investors also a role to play. Schmalz pointed to the Investment Company Act, which limits investment funds to holding no more than 10% of a corporation's securities. Vanguard on average holds 10% of all S&P 500 companies, Schmalz research has found, but it is not violating the law because companies within its fund family own the shares, not Vanguard itself. But Vanguard still executes the voting rights of more than 10% of shareholders. 'The law is written at the fund level so technically speaking they don't violate the law, but they are violating the spirit of the law,' Schmalz said. Economists and attorneys working on US antitrust law have proposed prosecuting mutual funds like BlackRock or Vanguard that own large stakes in multiple companies in the same sector. Such shareholders can exert an outsize influence on companies' pricing decisions, Schmalz said, and he noted the SEC wrote around the time the Investment Act was passed that: 'The national public interest ... is adversely affected ... when investment companies [have] great size [and] excessive influence on the national economy.' Schmalz said there's little discussion among policymakers to address that specific issue. Biden's budget includes over $220m for antitrust enforcement, and bills that would break up large tech companies have bipartisan Senate and House support. The Guardian's analysis highlighted the commodity market boom as companies trading in grain, steel, mining, wood, rubber, meat, oil, homes and other materials generally recorded higher profit increases than companies across the rest of the economy. However, many commodity companies operate in what analysts characterize as 'feast and famine' cycles in which they're unprofitable for years before cashing in. The pendulum has swung for many commodity companies in the day's economic climate. 'When there's a chance to raise prices when markets are tight, companies are going to do so,' said Skanda Amarnath, executive director of the Employ America thinktank. 'It's some part opportunistic, some part greed, some part rationality, some part a response to uncertainty.' The oil industry highlights the dynamic. After seven years of low returns, it's restricting supply to boost profits regardless of how that hits Americans at the pump. Earnings calls transcripts reveal executives eagerly 'putting shareholders first' and an investor who described industry-wide supply suppression 'one of the delights of this earnings season'. Bringing volatile commodity prices under control would require curtailing uncertainty and building supply chain resiliency, analysts who spoke with the Guardian say. That could involve some degree of government intervention to cut down on risk by establishing a floor on commodity prices. The government could do that by effectively becoming the 'buyer of last resort' when material prices dip below a certain level. But the government should also set a ceiling above which it collects profits, said commodities analyst Alex Turnbull. He suggested the federal government set up what's effectively a state reserve board. Turnbull pointed to lithium, which, amid increased demand for EV batteries and supply chain squeezes, jumped from $5,000 a ton to $45,000 a ton last year. Higher prices impact the pace of the clean energy transition, and the government could hypothetically set a $10,000 a ton floor price and $25,000 a ton ceiling that would limit the volatility, Turnbull said. The federal government could also increase stockpile reserves of products like grain or oil that are released when prices spike. 'That sends the message 'You should plant more wheat because if it goes really bad, you might have a lean year or two, but we will buy your wheat. But on the other hand don't expect to buy a Lamborghini if you're a farmer in Iowa because when prices get too high we'll be out there selling the shit out of our stockpiles,'' Turnbull said. Stabilization may also spur investment in raw material production that's risky, which would further bolster markets against future supply shortages. Few companies have built steel plants in recent years because the prices have been so low, Turnbull noted, and now the world is short on steel. Though price caps are 'not politically palatable' Bespoke Investment analyst George Pearkes said, the government could take a number of measures to steer futures curves and markets for raw commodities like oil and wheat. 'Something in between where there are strategic efforts to smooth volatility, and provide the private sector with enough certainty that they can make decisions is a lot more compelling,' he said. Spikes in investment for some commodities, like nickel, that are essential to the clean energy transition, can be a positive development, Turnbull said. Mining companies limped through the several years leading up to the pandemic, but reaped windfalls over the last year. 'People say 'Nickel producers are making too much money', well, they didn't make money for a decade,' Turnbull said. 'At some point, somebody has to put money down to dig holes because people aren't going to drive to the middle of fucking nowhere with a truck and work for free.' Another force in some commodity price spikes: Wall Street speculation. Commodity markets were once heavily regulated because they deal in raw materials that underpin the economy. An influx of investment capital followed the commodity markets' deregulation about 20 years ago, and some are now treated like speculative assets similar to bitcoin, said Rupert Russell, who authored a book on the topic. The consequences of economy-addling commodity price spikes are real, he adds, pointing to the 2010 grain prices that helped trigger the Arab spring uprising in Tunisia. Supply chain back ups, inflation and war have generated 'radical uncertainty' in which no one knows how much commodities are worth, because the prices are no longer anchored, Russell told the Guardian. He echoed others' calls for stronger government intervention to tamp down the casino-like mentality. 'Once there's not just radical uncertainty but markets dominated by speculators, algorithmically driven speculation that is just kind of responding to headlines, then you're going to get that kind of Bitcoin-esque volatility,' he said.

Sentencing Becker, the judge, Deborah Taylor, said: 'I take into account what has been described as your 'fall from grace'. You have lost your career and reputation and all of your property as a result of your bankruptcy.' But she added: 'You have not shown remorse, acceptance of your guilt and have sought to distance yourself from your offending and your bankruptcy. While I accept your humiliation as part of the proceedings, there has been no humility.' The former tennis star, sentenced under the Insolvency Act, will serve half the full prison term. He was found guilty of four charges by a jury at Southwark crown court this month but acquitted of a further 20 counts relating to his 2017 bankruptcy. He had faced a maximum prison sentence of seven years. Becker was handed a two-year suspended sentence for tax evasion and attempted tax evasion worth EUR1.7m (about PS1.4m) in Germany in 2002. Referring to that conviction, the judge said: 'You did not heed the warning you were given and the chance you were given by the suspended sentence and that is a significant aggravating factor.' Becker, wearing a striped tie in Wimbledon's purple and green colours, walked into the courthouse hand in hand with his girlfriend, Lilian de Carvalho Monteiro. His son Noah had also attended, carrying a large Puma bag. The six-time grand slam champion had denied all the charges, saying he had cooperated with trustees tasked with securing his assets - even offering up his wedding ring - and had acted on expert advice. But at the sentencing hearing on Friday, the prosecutor, Rebecca Chalkley, said Becker had acted 'deliberately and dishonestly' and that he was 'still seeking to blame others'. The defence attorney, Jonathan Laidlaw, argued for leniency, saying his client had not spent money on a 'lavish lifestyle' but rather on child support, rent and legal and business expenses. Becker, he told the court, had experienced 'public humiliation' and had no future earnings potential. Becker's bankruptcy stemmed from a EUR4.6m loan from a private bank in 2013, as well as about $1.6m borrowed from a British businessman the year after, according to testimony at the trial. During the trial Becker, said his $50m (PS40m) career earnings had been swallowed up by payments for an 'expensive divorce' and debts when he lost large chunks of his income after retirement. But the judge took into account the lengths to which Becker went to avoid paying his debts, including failing to declare his share in a PS1m property in his home town of Leimen, Germany, hiding an EUR825,000 (almost PS700,000) bank loan, worth PS1.1m with interest, and concealing 75,000 shares in a tech business valued at PS66,000. Matthew Carter, a partner in the National Bankruptcy Centre at the international audit, tax and advisory firm Mazars, said: 'Today's verdict reaffirms the serious consequences for those who fail to comply with their legal obligations as a bankrupt under the Insolvency Act.' 'Mr Becker failed to declare significant assets in his bankruptcy and this sentence serves as a stark warning to those who attempt to hide their assets,' he added. 'There are no winners in this unfortunate case, and it is imperative that anybody facing financial difficulty seeks specialist insolvency advice as early as possible to avoid issues escalating to this extent.' The chief executive of the Insolvency Service, Dean Beale, said: 'Boris Becker's sentence clearly demonstrates that concealing assets in bankruptcy is a serious offence for which we will prosecute and bring offenders to justice.'", "17ccf94b91697dcde972c0b98e4fd31e33cef73e02da89271e47c25b": "A Metropolitan police officer has been given a final written warning after appearing on the Nigerian version of Big Brother without permission. A misconduct hearing found that PC Khafilat Kareem had breached the standards of professional behaviour in relation to 'orders and instructions' and 'discreditable conduct', so a final written warning should be given after gross misconduct was proven. Kareem had requested unpaid leave to appear on the show in July 2019, and although permission for the leave was granted, she was not given permission to appear on the show. Shortly after the unpaid leave was granted, Kareem left the UK and took her work laptop with her without permission. When she appeared on the show, she surrendered her laptop to the show's organisers. The panel, led by an independent legally qualified chair, found that Kareem had breached the standards of professional behaviour. DCS Andy Day said: 'Permission was refused for PC Kareem to appear on the Nigerian version of Big Brother as it was felt it was not in the best interest for either her or the Metropolitan police service to take part. Despite this refusal, she went on the show anyway. 'A detailed investigation was carried out by the Met's directorate of professional standards which concluded Kareem should face gross misconduct proceedings. 'Being a police officer means you must abide by the standards of professional behaviour. PC Kareem's behaviour clearly fell far short and she has been given a final written warning.' The panel found this breach of professional standards, relating to the laptop, proven at the level of misconduct. Africa Magic, the TV company behind Big Brother Naija, said she had joined the show 'so that she can do societal good'. A profile of Kareem on the broadcaster's website said she would spend the prize money that was worth 30m naira (PS68,000) to host a travel show touring Nigeria's 'beauty spots' and 'invest in charitable causes'.

Five out of the 12 were found guilty of killing MacDonald Masambuka, 22, at the height of a crime spree that saw more than 40 murders and 145 assaults on people with the condition in the country. The priest, Masambuka's brother, a police officer and a hospital employee were convicted of selling human body parts. 'MacDonald was betrayed by those he had trust in, namely the brother, the priest, the policeman and the clinical officer. These are positions of trust,' said the country's public prosecutions director Steve Kayuni. From 2014 Malawi suffered a wave of assaults over several years against people with albinism, whose body parts are sometimes used in witchcraft rituals in the mistaken belief that they bring wealth and luck. In a judgment on Thursday, the high court concluded that the 12 plotted to kill Masambuka to extract his bones, hoping to benefit financially. 'This is a violation of the right to human life and the greatest violation of the rights to life and integrity for persons with albinism,' said Ms Justice Dorothy NyaKaunda Kamanga. Masambuka was murdered after being enticed by his brother to meet his friends, who he claimed had found him a woman to marry. Sentencing has been set for 31 May. There are about 20 cases under prosecution in Malawian courts involving the murder, attempted murder or exhumation and selling of body parts of people with albinism, said Kayuni.

Lord Martin Rees said technical improvements and more sophisticated artificial intelligence meant robotic missions were becoming ever more capable of exploration, and even construction, in space, making it unnecessary for space agencies to front far-flung human missions. 'We should not have publicly funded programmes to send people to the moon, still less to Mars,' said Rees. 'It's hugely risky, hugely expensive, and there's no practical or scientific benefit to sending humans. It's a pretty bad bargain for the taxpayer.' His comments prompted a robust defence from some experts, who stressed that government-backed spacefaring is a way to project soft power and provided huge inspiration, adding that the private sector could turn space into the 'wild west'. But Rees argues we should encourage and cheer on explorers and billionaire entrepreneurs who want to leave Earth in search of adventure in the spirit of Shackleton and Scott - both of whom died on Antarctic expeditions. The SpaceX founder, Elon Musk, has long enthused about moving to Mars, noting 'there's a good chance of death'. While human genetic modification should be heavily regulated on Earth, Rees said, Mars settlers would be free to enhance their children to cope with life on the red planet. Doing so could drive the divergence of the species, he added, raising the unsettling prospect of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs being the seed stock for a bunch of puny post-humans, given the weak Martian gravity. 'They will have every incentive to try to redesign themselves and these changes are going to be rapid compared with Darwinian evolution,' Rees said. 'If something evolves that's rather different from present day human beings, it's likely to evolve from them, not us.' Astronauts last set foot on the moon half a century ago. Since then, humans have not ventured further than a few hundred miles into space, mostly to the International Space Station. Space agencies, including from the US, Europe, China and Russia, are now on course to return to the moon. Mars is next in line. The cost is considerable because humans are fragile. The US president, Joe Biden, has requested $26bn (PS20.6bn) for Nasa in 2023, with $7.5bn earmarked for the Artemis programme which aims to put the first woman and the first person of colour on the moon as early as 2025. 'I think many people support the idea of science in space and assume humans are an essential part of that. In a way they are, because an astronaut knows more geology than a present-day robot,' Rees said. 'But the kinds of robots we will send in 20 years may be able to decide where to dig on Mars as well as any actual geologist could.' Closer to Earth, Rees fears the phrase 'space tourism' underplays the danger in the activity. He wants it rebranded as high-risk adventure so inevitable tragedies do not become national traumas, as happened when Nasa lost space shuttles in 1986 and 2003. Even brief trips to the edge of space, such as those planned by Virgin Galactic, are risky. 'There are going to be crashes even on these suborbital flights, and they'll be less traumatic and seem less of a disaster if they are viewed in the way of someone falling off Everest, rather than a civilian airliner crash,' he said. The astronomer, who argues the case in a new book, The End of Astronauts, believes private spacefarers will inspire people as much as space agency astronauts. But others are sceptical. Prof David Southwood, a former chair of the UK Space Agency and senior research investigator at Imperial College, said: 'If you've ever been in a room with Tim Peake and a couple of hundred schoolchildren, there's a buzz and enthusiasm because he's done something very few people have done, out on the final frontier. They think 'he's like me'. You don't have to be a billionaire.' Didier Schmitt, the head of the strategy and coordination group for robotic and human exploration at the European Space Agency, said the trend for human spaceflight being used as soft power and power projection would continue. 'The robotic versus human spaceflight rhetoric is an old debate that has definitely been superseded by the US and Chinese new race for the moon and Mars,' he said. Leaving human exploration to the private sector risked 'a wild west approach in space', he added, stressing it was important to balance private exploitation with public exploration in space. 'It is a duty for governments, and not the free market, to enthuse the younger generation,' he added. 'Taking into account the 22,500 candidates for the next European Space Agency astronaut corps is a clear message to politicians.'", "453c324bae08fc2ab80c370612a890bfaa16947820b0c71dce471728": "The Netherlands has been forced again to face questions about attitudes to sexual violence towards women after one of the country's most famous football pundits appeared to admit live on air to assaulting an unconscious woman with a candle 50 years ago. Dutch prosecutors opened an investigation after Johan Derksen, 73, made the comments on Tuesday on the talkshow Today Inside, to the amusement of presenter Wilfred Genee and fellow pundit Rene van der Gijp. The former player, who is one of the Netherlands' most famous TV personalities, sought to backtrack on his statement the following day, claiming the candle had only been placed close to the unnamed woman's legs. But he has refused to apologise for the remarks, saying only that he had been unclear and had told the story of a drunken night five decades ago 'in the wrong tone'. In response to the outcry, Derksen added: 'There is no room for a Johan Derksen in the Netherlands.' A spokesperson for the Dutch prosectors' office said the chief prosecutor in the northern Netherlands service had opened an inquiry. 'This research is aimed at establishing the truth of possible criminal behaviour that was discussed in that programme', they said. 'We also call on those involved to tell their story, as far as possible. It is clear that this is highly unacceptable behaviour that transgresses boundaries. 'In addition, the way in which it is talked about in the TV programme is also particularly hurtful. This can deeply affect victims of sexual offences even after a long time.' The case comes fast on the back of claims of widespread sexual abuse on the Dutch version of The Voice, which has raised questions about attitudes to sexual exploitation and violence towards women in the country. Two out of three women in the Netherlands reported that they were harassed on Dutch streets in 2021, according to figures from the Central Bureau of Statistics. Both Today Inside and The Voice Holland are produced by the media company Talpa, run by John de Mol, a founder of the Big Brother franchise. Talpa had said the presenters would apologise on Thursday for their comments but it was revealed later that Derksen had quit. Derksen reportedly told reporters: 'We were to offer our sincere apologies and then they would to decide to continue the programme. We're not here to pass an apology exam. Kiss my arse.' During the programme, which was watched by 600,000 viewers, Derksen had recounted what he later described as a 'childhood sin' in 1971, when he would have been 22. He said: 'I was out with the keeper of Veendam, with two ladies. We're drunk, we're going to that house and those ladies are so drunk, they puke all over us. Then I remember - and I'm not proud of it, but things like that happen when you're young - that lady was lying unconscious on one of those couches and there was this big candle and we put it in it and then we left.'", "9ba6a08aa16a10eae8c8aae3fdaa3a9ddf1352d97ecf28776304931d": "Racism rooted in slavery, colonialism and apartheid is responsible for higher Covid death rates among people of African and Asian descent, as well as Roma and Indigenous peoples, a UN body has said. That the vast majority of Covid-19 vaccines were administered in high and upper-middle-income countries replicated 'slavery and colonial-era racial hierarchies', according to the committee on the elimination of racial discrimination (Cerd). The committee said a failure to redress injustices has denied basic human rights to health and worsened discrimination and exclusion. In a strongly worded statement released on Friday, the group said it was concerned that the pandemic's disproportionate impact 'is in significant part attributed to consequences of the historic racial injustices of slavery and colonialism that remain largely unaccounted for today'. The unequal distribution of vaccines between and within countries 'manifests as a global system privileging those former colonial powers to the detriment of formerly colonised states and descendants of enslaved groups,' the statement added. As of April 2022, only 15.21% of low-income country populations has received one vaccine dose. Peruth Nabirye, from EqualHealth's Campaign Against Racism, said it was important to hold countries where pharmaceutical companies are located accountable for fostering health inequities. She said: 'We are still tied up in systems of injustice and we are at the mercy of the global north to save our lives.' The Cerd statement singled out the UK, Germany and Switzerland for continuing to block a waiver on lifting intellectual property rules that would enable the redistribution and scaling-up of the Covid response. India and South Africa first proposed the temporary waiver on WTO rules for intellectual property in October 2020. Meena Jagannath, director of global programmes at Movement Law Lab and coordinator of the Global Network of Movement Lawyers, said: 'It is unacceptable for states to privilege intellectual property rights of pharmaceutical companies over the human rights of people.' She added: 'The decision to side with pharma has deepened racial discrimination that is the product of unaddressed policies of colonialism and slavery.' Cerd is a body of independent experts that monitors how member states implement the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, adopted in December 1965. Under the convention, member states - including the UK - are charged with eliminating all forms of racial inequity and ensuring equality without discrimination on the grounds of 'race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin'.", "5d1676620c2eb054e58f2b030581ddf99662daf38a71007df92df44d": "It is a sign that political life in Washington is getting back to something like normal. It is the return of 'nerd prom'. On Saturday the White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA) will host its annual dinner for the first time since 2019 after a coronavirus-enforced hiatus, and Joe Biden will become the first US president to address the gala since Barack Obama in 2016 following a boycott by Donald Trump, who made little secret of his contempt of the media. Capacity for the dinner at the Washington Hilton hotel is more than 2,600 and it is fully booked but the specter of Covid-19 has not entirely lifted. After the Gridiron Club dinner earlier this month, some attendees, including cabinet secretaries and members of Congress, tested positive for coronavirus amid a surge of cases in the nation's capital. Although guests on Saturday are required to provide proof of vaccination and same day negative test, Biden, 79, will not be there for the eating portion of the dinner and his top adviser on the coronavirus, Anthony Fauci, 81, decided not to attend 'because of my individual assessment of my personal risk'. Sally Quinn, 80, an author, journalist and socialite, is also staying away. 'I can't imagine going into a room with 2,600 people in this day of Covid,' she said. 'Covid is not over, as we learned from the Gridiron, and it's only gotten worse in Washington since then, so it's just got to be a super spreader. It's not worth dying for, that's for sure.' The occasion allows the 106-year-old White House Correspondents' Association to present reporting awards, honor freedom of speech and raise money for scholarships. But the flashy dinner has become a subject of morbid fascination for its earnest schmoozing and perceived narcissism. Quinn, widow of Ben Bradlee, former editor of the Washington Post, recalled: 'It was this journalistic event and then it got way out of hand, all about celebrities and being seen and the comedy. It seemed to lose its point and, toward the end of the Obama administration, it became grotesque. It was ridiculous and embarrassing.' Among the celebrities present in 2011 was Trump. He was mercilessly lampooned by Obama, who even displayed a pastiche of what the White House would look like if - as then seemed unimaginable - the reality TV star became president one day. Journalist Steve Clemons, who sitting at the next table and watching Trump's reactions, recalled: 'He was not laughing at all. He was as grim and as stern looking as could be. It is rumored - and he has said it - that his decision to run for president happened on that night when Barack Obama mocked him.' In 2018, comedian Michelle Wolf's after-dinner routine savaged Trump administration officials sitting just feet away and was condemned by some for going too far. Some observers hope that the break and return of the sitting president offer a chance to lower the temperature. Clemons, editor-at-large of Semafor, a new media company, said: 'The tension that began to grow between the president, whoever the entertainment was, and all of this drama became a little bit too unglued and unmoored from the fundamental celebration of what journalism is supposed to be.' He added: 'The president is supposed to be there to essentially embrace the fact that we are holding him to account. It's supposed to be light hearted. A lot of people misread this as chumminess and there certainly is chumminess on the evening but it doesn't mean that you're not teaching people about critical thinking and objective distance reporting in journalism.' When Obama attended the dinners, the audience was often treated to spoof videos that co-starred Biden, who was then vice-president and seemed to relish a comic turn with his beloved cars and sunglasses. Clemons, who has been attending the event since the 1990s, observed: 'They were like Veep episodes that they were creating. Joe Biden really loves this dinner. Even if he hated the press corps, he would still do this dinner.' Biden will be expected to make fun of political rivals and deliver topical one-liners. Finding humor in a pandemic that has killed nearly a million Americans, or in the Vladimir Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine, could be dangerous territory. The dinner also typically features a roast of the president by an entertainer. This year South African Trevor Noah, host of Comedy Central's Daily Show, will face one of the toughest audiences for any comedian: a mix of Democrats, Republicans, liberal and conservative journalists and celebrities who will not necessarily all laugh at the same jokes. Quinn added: 'It's very tricky because a lot of them have bombed or they've got too mean or they've just not been funny. I would suspect Trevor Noah will be pretty good, but there's no predicting because even really good people just bomb sometimes if their jokes aren't good. 'Also, I would think that the tone of this is going to be not as much hilarity since there is the war in Ukraine, Covid, inflation, fires are raging in New Mexico and the world is going to hell. The eat, drink and be merry idea is a little off key.' She is not the only one avoiding the dinner for one reason or another. Asked whether it is safe for Biden to attend, David Axelrod, a former chief strategist for Obama, told the New York Times: 'Well, there is a question of whether it's EVER appropriate to engage in an exercise in gaudy, celebrity-drenched self-adulation, but that's a separate question.'", "a0e09b5c7abf2065ac27a168900649a8b03f91980e101960d36c4b05": "With awkward embraces and fixed grins, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Mohammed bin Salman struck a pose of reconciliation. For the past three years, the presence of the Turkish leader and the Saudi crown prince in the same room would have been unthinkable, but in a drawing room of a Jeddah palace on Friday, both tried to signal a new beginning. There was no sign of the acrimony that had set the regional rivals apart and - most definitely - no mention of the reason for the rift: the Saudi murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Instead, Erdogan, who had been prepared to take bilateral relations between regional heavyweights beyond the brink, seemed content to be standing in his rival's palace. The Saudi crown prince, meanwhile, had the look of a man who had won a prize. The path to this point had been fraught. Ties between Saudi Arabia and Turkey had been mostly severed since October 2018, when a team of assassins, most of them security aides to Prince Mohammed, flew to Istanbul to ambush and dismember the Saudi dissident inside the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul. But the murder was taped by Turkish spies and the ensuing investigation led to the heart of Prince Mohammed's court, resulting in Erdogan boycotting the defacto leader and rebuffing billions of dollars in compensation offered by Saudi envoys. It also amplified a faultline at the time between an alliance of Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt, on one hand, and an opposing bloc of Qatar, Turkey and the remnants of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood on the other. For more than three years, the two sides dug in, and Erdogan rarely missed a moment to embarrass the Saudi heir, or to assert Ankara as a regional counterweight to Riyadh. But, battered by a troubled economy at home, facing an election, and seemingly tiring of isolation, Erdogan's hardline stance has gradually given way to realpolitik. He has reached out to the UAE and Israel and has even made overtures to Egypt, where ties have remained poisonous since the coup that ousted the regime of Mohamed Morsi and ushered in the strongman Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Saudi Arabia, however, was the trickiest bridge to cross. For Erdogan to win a reset, he needed to eat humble pie. Last year a view started to take shape in Turkey that it had reaped little advantage from its standoff with Riyadh. With Donald Trump still in the White House, there may have been more of an angle for leverage. But the 2020 US election changed that; Joe Biden has distanced himself from both leaders, and neither are particularly fond of him. If there was to be detente, however, one problem needed to be fixed; the ongoing in trial in absentia in Istanbul of Khashoggi's accused killers. Earlier this month, Prince Mohammed got his wish when a Turkish prosecutor decided to stop the trial. The stage was set. So, with eyes on trade ties, and using a pilgrimage to Mecca as cover, Erdogan stood in front of Prince Mohammed on Friday, his ambitions to consolidate a rival power base to Riyadh subsumed by domestic politics and a desperate need for economic growth that trade ties with Saudi Arabia would help Erdogan also paid homage to the Saudi monarch, King Salman, with whom he had tried to deal directly in the weeks after Khashoggi's death in an effort to sideline Prince Mohammed. At home, his visit was observed in sombre tones, with any mention of Khashoggi kept to a minimum. 'My visit is the manifestation of our common will to start a new era of cooperation as two brotherly countries,' Erdogan said before leaving Istanbul. He was met in Jeddah as if nothing had ever split the two countries. Privately, however, Saudi officials were jubilant. Erdogan's trip had capped Turkey's ambitions to play more of a regional role, one official told the Guardian. 'He needs us more than we need him, and he's the one traveling to us. This stance of his has cost him billions in lost revenues. Any trade will be on our terms.'", "c1bf24943909c100dfa800aecf3e437c4d2c35c32ba6ba137159c523": "South Africa may be entering a fifth Covid wave earlier than expected after a sustained rise in infections over the past 14 days that seems to be driven by the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron sub-variants, health officials and scientists have said. The country that has recorded the most coronavirus cases and deaths on the African continent only exited a fourth wave around January and had predicted a fifth wave could start in May or June, early in the southern hemisphere winter. The health minister, Joe Phaahla, told a briefing that although hospitalisations were increasing there was so far no dramatic change in admissions to intensive care units or deaths. He said at this stage health authorities had not been alerted to any new variant, other than changes to the dominant Omicron variant circulating. The infectious disease specialist Richard Lessells told the same briefing that waning immunity from previous waves could be contributing to the earlier-than-expected resurgence in cases. He said the rising share of infections attributed to the BA.4 and BA.5 sub-lineages of Omicron suggested they had a growth advantage over other Omicron sub-variants such as BA.2. So far there was no sign that BA.4 and BA.5 were causing significantly more severe disease, said Waasila Jassat from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases. South Africa has reported more than 3.7m Covid cases and more than 100,000 deaths during the pandemic. On Thursday, the WHO's Africa office flagged the rise in South Africa's infections as the main driver of an increase on the African continent. Senior health official Nicholas Crisp also said on Friday South Africa had enough vaccine doses and was not planning to procure more. He added the government was not intending to buy Pfizer's Covid treatment pill Paxlovid for public sector patients, partly because it was very expensive.", "f3046fa106649d3a5bae1fe70f58f7a9620d28cf2f385c036ed094d3": "", "190fe930f5d778690f3c8c9e7a55e341329373ca28ae6d5caa29be6d": "", "cf0d2c1910c95b045b5f48e4ae6d8e94317309d00a1726b07fdf4f7d": "", "3c37f863c580caf90b68003a09c2bbadddff9bad6417000951592a3d": "", "a85fab0961a11d0b39f296e20d291e8717a5c958902495ea0ad51778": "", "10eeda691fe3cdd2b447be8592111cceb485c98631e2cda67aa9091c": "", "691742afb78c6a1038f19a2965534c2fa27c685801c2f14d71e24023": "", "d7a44c370fb4f7309d218d1351bbd50d75381479a87b42b8312ec818": "", "20f860a6fc8fd82c959d5af3694a6f8e77752131011bd930a0bfc0fb": "", "85d1569571d7427307541195bf3a27d807e0560e5a03d4723152321b": "'Just be careful where your back end is going,' says the instructor as this reporter nervously steers a 44-tonne articulated Volvo lorry on a roundabout. It is good advice at roundabouts, as in life. The trailer rolls past the safety barrier with a barely visible gap, to the relief of everyone involved. It is a manoeuvre played out across the world countless times each day as lorries lug the goods required for modern life from factory to consumer. However, this truck is slightly different: instead of a diesel engine, it is running on natural gas. It is one of the products of a series of bets by lorry manufacturers on how to reduce the carbon footprint of road transport, a key contributor to global carbon emissions. About 16% of the UK's carbon emissions in 2019 were from heavy goods vehicles, which carried 1.4bn tonnes across 17.8bn km in the year to June 2021, according to the Department for Transport. Manufacturers are backing a range of technologies from gas, to battery electric and various types of hydrogento try to decarbonise those journeys - but none has yet succeeded at scale. Everyone who drives an electric car for the first time after a lifetime of petrol or diesel has had the moment of realisation: this really is the future. A similar dynamic is happening now with lorries. At the same test drive event, held this week at the Millbrook Proving Ground by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, there was also the chance to try out the LF Electric, assembled by Dutch lorrymaker DAF Trucks at its Leyland subsidiary in Lancashire. Compared with the noise and judder of a diesel engine it is a serene experience on a sunny spring day in the rolling Bedfordshire hills. So serene, in fact, that another good-natured instructor has to intervene to prevent another roundabout mishap.  The problems are range and cost. The LF Electric, of which 25 have been built so far, has a 220km range and smaller 19-tonne capacity that prevents it from taking on the motorway trucking routes that serve as the backbone of modern economies. And the sticker price is currently three times that of a diesel. Even Elon Musk has been unable to crack the problem, judging by the Tesla Semi which is now years overdue. Nikola this week began production of electric 'semis' at its new Arizona plant, but only after its founder, Trevor Milton, was charged with allegedly rolling a prototype down a hill to pretend it was working. Some experts think it will be 2025 before larger electric trucks hit the mainstream. David Cebon, a professor of mechanical engineering at Cambridge University, has just completed the first stage of a government-funded feasibility study into a novel solution to batteries' lower-energy density. An electric road system, or e-highway, would install train-style overhead charging cables on main roads. Topping up a smaller battery through catenary cables on the road would save on the cost of buying more battery capacity for every lorry, and it would be more energy efficient and less damaging to roads because there would be less weight on the move. However, it would need full government buy-in to give permission and investment estimated at (a relatively modest) PS19bn to cover most of the UK's freight. There is lower-hanging fruit in mid-duty trucking. Startup Volta Trucks is developing its products in Warwick in the UK, with the aim of building as many as 5,000 7.5-tonne and 12-tonne all-electric lorries in 2023, and a target of 14,000 the year after. The factory in Austria formerly made diesel vans. Another startup, Tevva, is planning to make battery and hydrogen fuel cell trucks of 7.5 tonnes and upwards, with an annual capacity by 2025 of 9,000, in part at a site in Tilbury, Essex. Volta will start a trial with the crown estate in the summer to supply central London shops from out-of-town warehouses. Essa Al-Saleh, Volta's chief executive, told the Guardian: 'That's an ideal case for electrification where you only need to deploy charging infrastructure at the depot, or at the warehouse.' The demonstrator seen by the Guardian just off London's Regent Street earlier this year looks very different to traditional trucks, with the driver sitting at eye level with pedestrians and cyclists - potentially improving safety. Al-Saleh thinks batteries will dominate, albeit with niches for other powertrains. 'I do think there are a lot of innovations that are extending the ranges and density of batteries, enabling longer distances,' he said. The natural gas option is, of course, still a fossil fuel, so its combustion has a significant carbon footprint, and Russia's war on Ukraine has added to the impetus to shift away from reliance on it in the long term. A cleaner alternative is methane produced by anaerobic digestion of food waste, known as biogas or bio-LNG (liquefied natural gas). Gasrec, a company working on gas refuelling stations for the likes of Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda, estimates that a truck running on bio-LNG reduces carbon dioxide emissions by 90% compared to a diesel. Even Sweden's Volvo and Iveco, an Italian-listed manufacturer whose S-Way is also available in natural gas version, are open about the fact that methane combustion is a transition technology. Lars Stenqvist, head of trucks technology at Volvo Group, said: 'It's clear to us that we need more than one solution to decarbonise transport. We currently see three technologies in parallel that will decarbonise the heavy vehicle industry. 'We are investing more than ever into combustion engines, battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles.' One of the big unanswered questions in trucking is hydrogen's role. Hydrogen is energy dense and offers very quick refuelling. Fuel cells can power electric motors with water as the only exhaust emission. Brendan Bilton, chief technology officer of Element 2, is building a hydrogen refuelling network in the UK. He argued hydrogen would be needed for the biggest lorries doing long-haul routes without time to recharge. 'We haven't heard anyone saying, 'we're just waiting for our 44-tonne truck to get a battery,'' he said. 'It just doesn't work.' However, there are big questions over the amount of electricity needed to make green, high-purity hydrogen to power a large proportion of the world's lorries. For this reason some analysts believe hydrogen fuel cells - or another option, combustion - will play a relatively small role. 'The potential future market for hydrogen vehicles is shrinking daily,' said Gniewomir Flis, who scouts electrochemical technologies at Energy Revolution Ventures, an early-stage investor. 'I believe the majority of trucks will be battery electric.'", "70e1fab55ca27052ccab51a5f40dff2bcd62a5ca4f3456359e3bd2c0": "Communities across the US are using federal stimulus money to bring grocery stores and healthy food to food deserts, as the pandemic and rising costs put nutrition further out of reach for many. The regions using American Rescue Plan funds include Montana's Fort Belknap Indian Reservation, a 1,000-sq-mile expanse shared by the Assiniboine and Gros Ventre tribes. Most of the reservation is considered a food desert by the US Department of Agriculture, meaning most residents have little access to healthy food. An Indigenous-owned company on the reservation plans to renovate and expand the Little River Trading Post, formerly part of the Kwik Stop chain, in the town of Fort Belknap Agency. The combination gas station and convenience store closed briefly after it was bought and then reopened in December selling apples, bananas, potatoes, onions and berries. 'Our berries fly off the shelves,' said Eddie Moore, a business development officer who runs the store for the Island Mountain Development Group, which bought the business last year. It plans to use federal stimulus funds to expand its fresh produce offering this year. At least five other communities have proposed using money from the American Rescue Plan - the $1.9tn package approved by Congress in 2021 to help the country recover from the pandemic's effects - to open or revive grocery stores, according to the US Treasury Department. A slew of other areas are looking at ways the funds could ease food insecurity. In Toledo, Ohio, local activists have urged the city to use $1m of the federal infrastructure funds to help attract a grocery store to a low-income neighborhood. Healthier food would help alleviate high obesity, cholesterol and blood pressure problems among Toledo's Black population, said the Rev Donald Perryman, president of the Toledo advocacy group United Pastors for Social Empowerment. 'When you have been an oppressed resident of our country in some of these disadvantaged neighborhoods, you develop some habits related to survival,' he said. 'Sometimes those habits become embedded.' Black and Latinos are more likely to live in areas without grocery stores than white people, as are low-income people. The grocery model is broken and the federal funding offers new ways to fix it, said Beverley Wheeler, director of DC Hunger Solutions, which runs nutrition programs in the nation's capital. 'Our large grocery stores have a business model that's built on education and income,' said Wheeler, who noted Washington DC plans to use American Rescue Plan funds to add smaller grocery stores to underserved neighborhoods this year. 'They don't build them in the neighborhoods where we need them.' It can be hard for a grocery store to make a profit even in affluent communities, so getting companies to stick around low-income neighborhoods is a challenge, said Connie Max, executive vice-president for lending with the Local Initiatives Support Corp, a non-profit that helps fund community projects. More communities are asking for help attracting or retaining grocers, Max said, with local governments and community non-profits gathering funds rather than waiting for companies to open stores on their own. 'The margins are pretty thin on grocery stores,' she said. 'Whenever we can, we try to help them to purchase the facility to really root them in the community.' But giving residents access to healthy food may not be as simple as opening a new grocery store. Toledo officials are trying to figure out what would help the most, especially in neighborhoods that have lost population. Less than half the population gets its groceries from grocery stores, said Sandy Spang, the city's deputy economic development director, down from 90% in 1988. The city is surveying residents to see whether new grocery stores would be more useful than, say, food trucks or other prepared food options. 'I think we need to recognize the distribution of food is changing,' Spang said. 'I don't think we can look at the solutions of 40 years ago. If you've lost density in neighborhoods, you're not necessarily going to have feasibility for traditional grocery stores.' In Birmingham, Alabama, which is also researching ways to use ARP funds for healthier food options, the city paid to renovate an abandoned grocery store but realized it would need to divide the building in half to attract a new grocer because companies tend to prefer smaller stores. Residents surrounded by convenience and dollar stores have sorely missed having access to fresh foods such as produce, baked goods and seafood, said Carol Clarke, the city councilor who represents the neighborhood. 'It is most assuredly a food desert,' she said. Other communities are also using ARP funds to ease food insecurity: Memphis, Tennessee, and Washington DC, also plan to open ARP-funded stores, and Charleston, West Virginia, has proposed Miss Ruby's Corner Market, which would take over the site of a former soda fountain near a senior housing complex where residents have trouble getting to grocery stores further away. The non-profit store will carry local produce and offer nutrition education, said Spencer Moss, executive director of the West Virginia Food & Farm Coalition, which is helping to open the business. 'We don't need to make a profit,' she said. 'We just need to break even.'", "b30087f218c04470bb02cd74d87651dce1e0f73c55a5ea26ea15c328": "", "faf797fadab9076750aeba946ea296268632a05d8ca8387834a6894e": "Russia attacked western Kyiv with two cruise missiles, as the UN secretary general Antonio Guterres visited the Ukrainian capital, a move that was hard to see as anything other than Moscow mocking the institution. Two loud explosions rocked Kyiv on Thursday evening, after Guterres visited the site of massacres and mass graves on the city's outskirts, and met with Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Ukrainian officials were quick to underline the extraordinary timing of the attack, just one day after Guterres met with Vladimir Putin (across the very long table the Russian leader uses for many meetings). Advisor Mykhailo Podolyak asked: 'Postcard from Moscow?' Defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, called the strikes an attack 'on the security of the Secretary General, and on world security!' A string of visits by leaders of Western allies, and senior US officials, in recent weeks - from British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to US Secretaries of State and Defence, Antony Blinken and Lloyd Austin - have passed without attacks. Thank you for following our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This blog has now closed. You can find our latest coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war in our new live blog in the link below. It is just past 7am in Ukraine and its capital, Kyiv, is still reeling from a missile attack launched the night before.  The blasts came soon after UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres met with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, admitting his organisation had failed to prevent or end the war.  Meanwhile, Nato has warned that the west needs to be prepared for the long haul and the possibility that the war will 'drag on and last for months and years.' Here's everything you might have missed: As usual, please feel free to reach out to me by email or Twitter for any tips or feedback. The UN Secretary General has criticised his own organisation's Security Council while on visit to Kyiv. During a press conference with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Antonio Guterres said the council had failed to prevent or end the war in Ukraine. Guterres pledged that he would 'boost our efforts across the board' and expand the council's cash assistance - distributing $100 million per month, reaching 1.3 million people by May and covering 2 million by August.  The 15-member UN Security Council is specifically tasked with ensuring global peace and security and has faced criticism for failing to act since Russia's invasion began in February.  Russia is preventing wounded Ukrainian fighters from being evacuated from the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol because it wants to capture them, the local officials say. Reuters reports Pavlo Kyrylenko as telling a briefing: Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin had been quite clear that while civilians could leave the plant, the defenders had to lay down their arms, Tass news agency said. 'What could be the topic of negotiations in this case?' the agency quoted him as saying. Mariupol city council said about 100,000 city residents were 'in mortal danger' because of Russian shelling and unsanitary conditions. It said the shortage of drinking water and food was 'catastrophic'. Canadian troops are training Ukrainian troops to use howitzer artillery, Canada's defence minister Anita Anand has confirmed. The United States has been training a small number of Ukrainian forces on howitzers and some other systems outside of Ukraine. Anand, speaking alongside US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, did not say where the Canadian training was taking place. The US House has given final passage to legislation that would streamline a World War II-era military lend-lease program to more quickly provide Ukraine with military aid. The measure, which passed on Thursday evening by an overwhelming 417-10 vote, now goes to the White House for President Joe Biden to sign into law. House foreign affairs committee Gregory Meeks of New York said with unified support from the US Congress, 'Ukraine will win.' The Biden administration announced earlier it will seek another $30 billion from Congress in military and humanitarian aid, on top of the nearly $14 billion Congress approved last month to help Ukraine fight the war. The measure would update the 1941 legislation Franklin Roosevelt signed into law to help allies fight Nazi Germany. At the time, the then-US president ushered the Lend-Lease Act through Congress, responding to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's appeal for aid, even as America initially remained neutral in the war, according to the US National Archives, the Associated Press reports. Biden is expected to sign the bill into law, giving the administration greater leeway to send military equipment to Ukraine and neighbouring allies in Eastern Europe. 'It is a real moment in history that we are back on this House floor supporting lend-lease,' said Rep. French Hill, R-Ark. The congressman said he hoped the 'Churchillian idea' would end delays in shipping aid to Ukraine, much the way the original law sped help to Britain fighting Adolf Hitler's Germany in World War II. Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Finland and Sweden would be 'warmly welcomed' should they decide to join the 30-nation military organisation and any membership process could 'go quickly'.  'It's their decision,' Stoltenberg said. 'But if they decide to apply, Finland and Sweden will be warmly welcomed, and I expect that process to go quickly.' He gave no precise time frame, but did say that the two could expect some protection should Russia try to intimidate them from the time their membership applications are made until they formally join. Stoltenberg said he's 'confident that there are ways to bridge that interim period in a way which is good enough and works for both Finland and Sweden.' Nato's collective security guarantee ensures that all member countries must come to the aid of any ally under attack. Stoltenberg added that many Nato allies have now pledged and provided a total of at least $8 billion in military support to Ukraine. A 22-year-old former US marine and American citizen, Willy Joseph Cancel, was reportedly killed while fighting alongside Ukrainian forces in Ukraine, members of his family have told CNN. Cancel was working with a private military contracting company when he was killed on Monday, his mother, Rebecca Cabrera, said. Cancel signed up to work for the company on top of his full-time job as a corrections officer in Tennessee shortly before the war in Ukraine broke out at the end of February, she added.  Cancel flew to Poland on March 12 and crossed into Ukraine sometime over March 12 and 13, Cabrera said.  Cabrera said she was told by those who notified her of her son's death that his body had not been found. A State Department official told CNN they are 'aware of these reports and are closely monitoring the situation.' Ukraine's president Zelenskiy has spoken of how Russian troops came within minutes of finding him and his family in the first hours of the war in an interview with Time magazine.  Reporter Simon Shuster interviewed the Ukrainian leader while spending two weeks in the presidential compound in Kyiv earlier this month. On the first day of war, Shuster writes that officials attempted to seal the compound 'with whatever they could find' as Ukrainian troops fought the Russians in the streets. 'Russian troops came within minutes of finding him and his family in the first hours of the war, their gunfire once audible inside his office walls,' he added.  The military reportedly informed Zelenskiy that Russian strike teams had parachuted into Kyiv to kill or capture him and his family.  Russian troops made two attempts to storm the compound, Oleksiy Arestovych, a veteran of Ukraine's military intelligence service and a senior presidential advisor, told the reporter. Zelenskiy later added that his wife and children were still there at the time. The US offered to evacuate the President and his team and help them set up a government in exile, most likely in eastern Poland. Speaking on a secure landline with the Americans, Zelenskiy responded: 'I need ammunition, not a ride.' As the war rages on two months later and casualties rise, the president said he has aged in the face of such brutality.  Rescuers have found two more bodies after a fire at a Russian aerospace defence research institute broke out last week, bringing the total number of deaths to 22, Tass news agency cited local emergency services as saying on Thursday. One person is still believed to be missing, the Russian state outlet said. The institute is in the city of Tver, about 160km (100 miles) northwest of Moscow. Authorities have opened a criminal investigation after media reports that an electrical fault caused the blaze. The fire erupted in an administrative building of the aerospace defence forces' central research institute, which operates under the Russian defence ministry. It quickly engulfed the building's upper three floors, forcing those inside to jump from windows and causing the roof to cave in. If you have just joined our live coverage of the war in Ukraine, here is a quick re-cap of where things currently stand.  The world's largest security body has said it is officially winding up its observer mission in Ukraine after eight years, after Russia vetoed its extension. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said in a statement it would 'take immediate steps' to close the mission after members failed to find a way around Russia's objections during a meeting last month, AFP reports. Poland's foreign minister Zbigniew Rau, whose country holds the rotating OSCE chairmanship, said the organisation had tried all options but 'the position of the Russian Federation left us with no choice'. The Vienna-based OSCE's mission to Ukraine began in 2014 after Russia-backed separatists launched an insurgency in the east. The organisation was the only international body monitoring the conflict on the ground. OSCE monitors were largely withdrawn from the country following Russia's full-scale invasion in February. But administrative staff were left behind, and four of them have since been detained. OSCE Secretary General Helga Maria Schmid said the organisation would continue to push for an 'end to the detentions, intimidation, and disinformation that are so dangerous for our national mission members'. The OSCE has 57 members on three continents - including Russia, Ukraine and the United States. Earlier today, US president Joe Biden said he was sending Congress a supplemental budget request to 'keep weapons and ammunition flowing' to Ukraine.  Biden added a 'comprehensive legislative package' would also be included to 'hold accountable the Russian oligarchs who enable Putin's war.'  'We need to seize the yachts, luxury homes, and other ill-begotten gains of Putin's kleptocrats,' he said. The United States is analysing strikes on Kyiv that the Ukrainian authorities blamed on Russian missiles, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said on Thursday. 'We're still trying to analyse this and figure out what happened here, what was struck and with what kind of munition,' he told CNN. More images of the aftermath of the missile strike on Kyiv have emerged.  Possible pseudo-referendums in the Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine will complicate negotiations between the countries, President Volodymyr Zelenskyiy has said.  In the event of any pseudo-referendums in the occupied territories they will not be recognised by Ukraine and the world and will complicate possible negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Zelenskyiy said during a press briefing following talks with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in Kyiv. About 8,000 British army troops will take part in exercises across eastern Europe to combat Russian aggression in one of the largest deployments since the cold war. Dozens of tanks will be deployed to countries ranging from Finland to North Macedonia this summer under plans that have been enhanced since Russia invaded Ukraine. Joining them will be tens of thousands of troops from Nato and the Joint Expeditionary Force alliance, which includes Finland and Sweden. The Ministry of Defence said the action had been long planned and had been enhanced in response to Russia's invasion of its neighbour in late February. The UK deployment is expected to build to a peak of about 8,000 personnel operating in mainland Europe between April and June.", "1251ad421be94d2e50b7090e6eca2d8e2e2ed1fa0c9f2f593b5265de": "A British citizen has been killed in Ukraine and a second is missing, the Foreign Office has confirmed, amid reports that both were volunteers who had gone to fight in the country. The Briton who died is understood to be Scott Sibley, a former British soldier who had served overseas. Ex-colleagues paid tribute on a Facebook page run by veterans of the commandos logistics support squadron, where he was described as a man who had 'showed commando spirit until the end'. In a statement the Foreign Office said: 'We can confirm that a British national has been killed in Ukraine and we are supporting their family.' On the missing person, the spokesperson said: 'We are aware of a British national who is missing in Ukraine and are supporting their family. We are urgently seeking further information.' The Foreign Office offered no further details, including whether the two cases were related and where the death occurred. Sky News reported the pair were thought to be volunteers fighting against Russian forces, but this has not been confirmed. Sibley is believed to be the first British fighter known to have been killed in combat in Ukraine. The Facebook page where tributes were paid to Sibley posted what is understood to be a photo of him while serving in the military in his younger days. He is seen in uniform, standing at what appears to be Bagram airfield in Afghanistan. Separately, tributes were also paid to him on a GoFundMe page set up to raise money for his family by people who said that they had known him through PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG), the hit online multiplayer game. 'I know only a couple of us got to meet Sibs outside our community and many had arranged to meet him or couldn't due to long distance, however each of us that had the pleasure of knowing Sibs were affected by his contagious laugh and ability to cheer us up! (Or wind us up haha),' wrote the page's organiser, Kate Barker.  A number of Britons, including former servicepeople, have volunteered to fight with the Ukrainian armed forces, some travelling to Ukraine well before the recent outbreak of hostilities and others going to Ukraine since Russia's invasion. Two other British volunteers were captured by Russian forces in the besieged southern port of Mariupol. Aiden Aslin and his fellow British fighter Shaun Pinner surrendered after their unit ran out of ammunition in their position inside the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, where the last Ukrainian defenders have been surrounded. In February, Downing Street distanced itself from a suggestion by the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, that Britons should be able to join the fight in Ukraine, saying this would contravene travel advice and people should instead consider making a donation instead. While not directly criticising Truss, Boris Johnson's spokesperson stressed that the Foreign Office currently advises against travel to Ukraine. It is understood that officials believed it would also be illegal for Britons to travel there with the intention of taking up arms. Truss had told the BBC she would 'absolutely' back anyone wanting to volunteer to help the Ukrainians battle the Russian invasion, saying: 'That is something people can make their own decisions about. The people of Ukraine are fighting for freedom and democracy, not just for Ukraine, but for the whole of Europe.'", "a7c2ec71b55e4ae07fb2f9d7a4e81176c5ad94f6ddb7b6dec6418949": "Ukraine's prosecutor general has named 10 Russian soldiers allegedly involved in human rights abuses during the month-long occupation of Bucha. Iryna Venediktova also told German TV that that Ukranian investigators had identified 'more than 8,000 cases' of suspected war crimes since Russia's invasion, which included accusations of 'killing civilians, bombing of civilian infrastructure, torture' and 'sexual crimes'. Her comments came as the international criminal court (ICC) ramps up its investigation into alleged war crimes committed in Ukraine since the start of the war. The Dutch government will 'very soon' send a team of 'several dozen' forensic specialists to Ukraine on behalf of the ICC to gather evidence of human rights abuses, the ANP press agency reported on Thursday. Russian forces' retreat from Kyiv in early April left horrifying evidence of atrocities littered across the region's suburbs and towns, where scores of bodies in civilian clothes were found lying in the streets or buried in shallow graves. In a Facebook post on Thursday, Venediktova identified 10 soldiers - two sergeants, four corporals and four privates - who she said were all 'involved in the torture of peaceful people' during the brutal occupation of Bucha, a small commuter town 18.5 miles north-west of Kyiv. Venediktova said the soldiers were part of the 64th Motor Rifle Brigade, a unit based in the Khabarovsk region, on the Pacific coast in Russia's far east. 'During the occupation of Bucha, they took unarmed civilians hostage, killed them with hunger and thirst, and kept them on their knees with their hands tied and their eyes taped. [The hostages] were mocked and beaten with fists and the rifle stocks. They were beaten for information about the location of the [Ukrainian] armed forces ... and some were tortured for no reason at all,' she wrote. Venediktova appealed to the public to help gather evidence, and said that Ukrainian prosecutors and police officers are now investigating whether any of the men were also involved in homicides. Ukraine, together with a number of western countries and human rights organisations, has accused Russian forces of summarily killing civilians in Bucha. Stanislav Kozynchuk, the deputy head of the prosecutor's office for the Kyiv region, said that investigators are working with victims to identify the perpetrators of human rights abuses. 'Our suspects are military personnel from the Russian Federation,' he said. 'We understand who was there, what happened, and now we are looking into these military units which participated in the killings.' Some of the implicated soldiers have already been redeployed to fight in eastern Ukraine, he said. In a recent report, Human Rights Watch said that 'Russian forces committed a litany of apparent war crimes during their occupation' of the town, adding that   investigators 'found extensive evidence of summary executions, other unlawful killings, enforced disappearances and torture, all of which would constitute war crimes and potential crimes against humanity.' The Guardian has reported that dozens of civilians who died during the Russian occupation of Bucha were killed by tiny metal arrows from shells of a type fired by Russian artillery. Earlier this month, Ukraine's defence ministry identified Russia's 64th Motor Rifle Brigade as the unit that had occupied Bucha, publishing the names, ranks and passport details of all the soldiers. Moscow has repeatedly denied any involvement in the alleged human rights abuses, while Russian state television has aired reports claiming that the images of dead civilians in Bucha were staged or the result of crimes committed by Ukrainian forces. During a meeting with the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, in the Kremlin on Tuesday, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said that 'Russian forces had no connections to Bucha.' 'We know who did it. We know who prepared this provocation ... We know who they are,' Putin added, without providing further details. Earlier this month, Putin awarded the 64th Motor Rifle Brigade the honorary title of 'guards' and praised the unit for its 'great heroism and courage'. 'This high distinction recognises your special merits, great heroism and courage in defending your Fatherland, and in protecting Russia's sovereignty and national interests,' Putin's statement said.", "e5451a3d85ac1acfec3eaf45149a125d6e186c0dddc10bbf897a8f0d": "An aggressive draft campaign by the Russian-backed separatists who control parts of eastern Ukraine has emptied the area's streets of military-age men, with many in hiding to avoid being sent to the frontline. In a sign of how desperate pro-Russia authorities are to bolster the ranks of fighters, in late March they announced that the upper age limit of the draft had been raised from 55 to 65 in Donetsk, local media reported. And on Saturday authorities announced a mobilisation in the region of Kherson, which was largely captured by Russia after the war began. Men who do not want to become cannon fodder in a war they do not support, against a country - Ukraine - that most of them still consider their own, are spending their days in hiding. Locals joke that they now live in a town of Amazons, run by women. Husbands, sons and brothers live in basements or locked indoors. They cannot stay in their own homes because registration is by address. Instead they stay at the homes of friends or relatives where no military-age men are listed as residents. Some come out at night, when the patrols rounding up unwilling recruits pause or are less frequent. 'When I walk my dog at 11pm I could see the silhouettes of men smoking behind the curtains, with a window open,' said one resident reached by phone, who like most in Donetsk did not want to be quoted by name. By day their jobs have been taken over by wives, sisters or female friends, or have simply gone unfilled. It is almost impossible to get a car repaired because most of the city's mechanics are men who would be covered by the draft, locals said. 'It usually takes 45 minute to fix a problem with my tyres, and I just grab a coffee nearby,' said one woman. 'But last time I was asked to drop my car and leave it over the weekend so that they could bring a guy to fix it at night.' Electronics shops in the market that used to be staffed by men are now run by female relatives, who put the usual owners on the line to handle any questions. 'You discuss all the technical details with him and then she will just give you what you wanted and take your money,' said one man who escaped the draft because of a medical condition and a foreign passport. The self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, the so-called separatist region backed and recognised by Russia, announced its draft on 19 February, a few days before the invasion of the rest of Ukraine. Exemptions have to be signed off by senior government officials, who themselves are one of the few groups to be spared the draft. The order went out extremely early to try to prevent the men affected from fleeing, and those caught included some visitors from the Ukrainian-controlled part of the country. 'My son went back to our home village to check on his grandmother two days before the draft was announced. Now he is stuck in the DNR and I am very worried,' said one man in western Ukraine, trying to gather money to fund an escape. 'He is in hiding, and hasn't left the house for two months now. There are ways to smuggle him out, but only to Russia and it is very expensive and risky.' In interviews with residents of the region, the Guardian heard of only two men granted leave to stay in their jobs. One was an anaesthesiologist, allowed to stay at his post when other doctors were ordered to join the military because he was one of just two experts left in the city. The other was a driver trained in using complicated construction equipment. Bribes work but the cost of draft-dodging is $800, an exorbitant amount for most people in an already poor area with an economy now crippled by the war. Men pushing the top end of the draft age group have grown beards in an attempt to look older, although the raising of the upper limit to 65 means grey hair alone offers little protection. In a further sign of desperation, city authorities have twice tried to lure men out of hiding by claiming the draft was finishing. Documents purporting to be government leaks about a new policy were shared on Telegram channels, but then men who came out of hiding because of them were seized and drafted. Locals now say they will not believe any more news of the draft being cancelled. 'Two times the authorities have tried to fool us by posting info that draft is over. So the next morning men started going out and they were all taken,' said another resident. 'Now everyone learned the lesson so if they will announce that draft is over no one will believe them.'", "1968db458872620a78e53ed432ef7c12a89e829280954dec8fab0512": "The government has acknowledged that processing problems within the Home Office have led to delays between the approval of visas for Ukrainian refugees and emailed notification that the visas have been granted - preventing many vulnerable people from swiftly making their way to safety. Politicians from all parties highlighted a variety of serious problems with the Homes for Ukraine visa scheme during an urgent question in the Commons on the Home Office's handling of the refugee crisis. Latest figures show that just one in five of those issued visas under the Homes for Ukraine scheme had arrived in the UK. MPs suggested that the relatively small number of people travelling was the consequence of visas not being issued to family units simultaneously, with approval of children's visas often taking several weeks longer. About 86,000 visas have been issued to people fleeing Ukraine under the government's two Ukraine refugee schemes (the Ukraine family scheme and the Homes for Ukraine scheme) but just 27,100 have travelled to the UK. Of the51,300 visas issued under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, only 11,000 have actually arrived in the UK. The Home Office minister Kevin Foster dismissed as nonsense reports that there was a deliberate Home Office policy to withhold children's visas. 'I am aware of the claims that have been made, the false claims I have to say, that there is a deliberate move to withhold individual visas. Those are absolute nonsense,' he told the Commons. But he admitted there were bureaucratic issues which meant refugees were not immediately receiving emails informing them that the visas had been granted. 'We have been aware of an issue with the way the current system is working, in terms of the decision being made and then needing to be dispatched,' he said. It has been clear for a number of weeks that there are serious delays between visas being approved and refugees receiving emails telling them they have permission to travel. This is understood to be the result of a workflow backlog between two separate teams of civil servants, with one group responsible for visa decisions and another group, based elsewhere, in charge of communicating those decisions. Foster said there was a separate team working on 'ensuring dispatch', but said the government was working on creating 'a fully online', automated system next month, which would 'resolve that particular issue'. The shadow Home Office minister Stephen Kinnock said there was widespread frustration at the speed with which refugee casework was being processed, adding: 'For too many, the hotline has gone stone cold.' Numerous MPs said delays in issuing visas were causing refugees to run out of money, exposing them to homelessness and a variety of other dangers while they waited for the UK government to grant their visas. Stuart McDonald, the Scottish National party's Home Office spokesperson, said the government had erected 'a massive wall of bureaucracy and red tape' which was 'causing totally avoidable misery for Ukrainians fleeing war', and called for the visa regime to be scrapped. Fellow SNP MP Deirdre Brock highlighted the case of Yulia, a primary school teacher from Kharkiv who has been waiting more than a month for her two-year-old daughter's visa to be granted. She was told earlier this week that the visa had been granted, and travel documents would be issued in a couple of days. 'But the child's mother had been phoned by mistake as it was, in fact, someone else's visa that had been granted, and it would take around another two weeks for the right visa to come through. These folks are, in effect, homeless,' she said. 'Each day the message that they are welcome in the UK fades a little more.' Andrew Saunders, who has offered to sponsor Yulia and her daughter, Diana, said: 'From start to finish it has been a staggeringly incompetent and inappropriate process - it was meant to take three to five days but we are more than a month in and we still await the visa for the two-year-old.' Yulia, who asked for her surname not to be printed, said she was puzzled by the need to conduct protracted checks before issuing a visa to a two-year-old. After a month in Germany, she said, she was running out of money, and her daughter was increasingly unsettled. 'I am feeling really upset and frustrated. We have already stayed in four places and we have to move again this weekend so I'm looking for a fifth place to stay. I feel powerless.' A government spokesperson said: 'We are processing thousands of visas a day - this shows the changes we made to streamline the service are working and we'll continue to build on this success so we can speed up the process even further.'", "8e30dadfec0c7b9d18cb923293f7a7b013932d6d283522d3d05a082d": "Moldova is facing 'a very dangerous new moment', the country's deputy prime minister has said, as he warned that unnamed forces were seeking to stoke tensions after a series of explosions in the breakaway region of Transnistria this week. In a briefing with journalists, Nicu Popescu said his government had seen 'a dangerous deterioration of the situation' in recent days, after grenade attacks on the 'ministry of security' in the breakaway region of Transnistria on Monday. The attacks with rocket-propelled grenades represented 'a very dangerous new moment in the history of our region,', he said, adding that Moldova's institutions had been put on high alert in response. Fears are growing that Moldova and Transnistria could be drawn into the Ukraine conflict. The predominantly Russian-speaking region of Transnistria in eastern Moldova has been controlled by pro-Russia separatists since 1992 after a short war when Moscow intervened on the side of the rebels. Last week a senior Russian commander said gaining control over southern Ukraine would help Russia link up with Transnistria, which shares a 453km border with Ukraine. Then on Monday came a series of mysterious explosions targeting Transnistria's 'state security ministry', a radio tower and military unit. 'Our analysis so far shows that there are tensions between different forces within the region interested in destabilising the situation and that makes the Transnistrian region vulnerable and creates risks for the Republic of Moldova,' said Popescu, who added that a majority of Moldovans, including those in Transnistria, wanted to stay out of the war. Moldova's government, which does not control Transnistria, was working through several hypotheses about the cause of the attacks, he said, adding that it could be a provocation or 'the result of some tensions of some forces inside this region'. He added: 'We cannot point exactly the finger or put the blame, but what we see is that indeed there are some forces inside the region that work towards the destabilisation of the situation inside this region.' According to Popescu, who is also Moldova's foreign minister, Transnistrian authorities announced last week they were stopping all men of fighting age from leaving the region, which he described as a sign that 'we are not yet out of the potential danger zone'. Moldova had received public and private assurances from Moscow 'that Russia continues to recognise the territorial integrity of Moldova', he said, adding that 'given the situation in the region, we remain very alert'. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova claimed on Thursday that recent incidents in Transnistria were an attempt to drag it into the conflict in Ukraine. Transnistrian authorities have blamed Ukraine for the attacks, while Kyiv has pointed the finger at Russia, saying Moscow is seeking to destablise the region. One senior EU diplomat said the incidents were 'clearly prepared by Russia themselves', a view that was based on their analysis of the situation, rather than intelligence sources. 'We don't see that there will be an active conflict', the diplomat said, 'but you never know because they [Russia] have done crazy things'. One of Europe's poorest countries, Moldova is grappling with a large influx of refugees and the economic fallout of the war that has stopped nearly 15% of its exports. About 95,000 people fleeing the war in Ukraine have arrived in Moldova, equivalent to 3.5% of the population, according to the Moldovan foreign ministry. While the number has stabilised and even decreased recently, the former Soviet country is still adapting to the new arrivals, with Ukrainian refugees now accounting for one in 10 of the child population in Moldova. The war is also having 'major negative economic impacts', Popescu said as up to 14% of Moldova's exports, which had gone to Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, had 'virtually stopped'. Inflation had shot up to 22% and the price of Moldova's imports had gone up, as the nearby Ukrainian port of Odesa - the cheapest way to transport many goods - was no longer available. Moldova is seeking economic support from the EU, as well as eventual membership of the bloc. The government in Chisinau filed a membership application in March soon after Ukraine launched its bid to join the EU, and is busy answering hundreds of questions from Brussels about its readiness to join. Last week, Moldova's government announced it had submitted to Brussels an initial questionnaire answering 369 questions; it is now working through a second document covering 2,000 other queries on the country's compatibility with EU law. 'We are a country with a European history, a European identity, a European language - and our Romanian language is already an official language of the EU, so that makes things much easier,' Popescu said, adding that Moldova had proven it was adept at changing governments through democratic means. But even EU member states sympathetic to Moldova, Ukraine and Georgia's membership bids say these countries are unlikely to join anytime soon.", "276903fc72453f3113b67e2266980eee27ed2da8a74ad5eba86080c7": "Russia has stepped up the pace of its offensive in eastern and southern Ukraine, and is preventing the evacuation of wounded Ukrainian fighters from a steelworks in Mariupol because it wants to capture them, Ukrainian officials have said. 'The enemy is increasing the pace of the offensive operation. The Russian occupiers are exerting intense fire in almost all directions,' Ukraine's military command said of the situation on the main front in the east. According to the officials, the focus of Russia's main attack was near the towns of Slobozhanske and Donets, along a strategic frontline highway linking Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, with the Russian-occupied city of Izium. The Kharkiv regional governor said Russian forces were intensifying attacks from Izium, but Ukrainian troops were holding their ground. Kharkiv regional prosecutors said two civilians were killed and seven wounded in Russian shelling of the village of Pokotilovka. Russia denies targeting civilians. Although Russian forces were pushed out of northern Ukraine last month, they are heavily entrenched in the east and still hold a swathe of the south that they seized in March. Kyiv has accused Moscow of planning to stage a fake independence referendum in the occupied south. Russian state media quoted an official from a self-styled pro-Russia 'military-civilian commission' in Kherson on Thursday as saying the area would start using Russia's rouble currency from 1 May. Ukrainian troops are still holed up in a steelworks in Mariupol, the ruined south-eastern port where thousands of people have died under two months of Russian siege and bombardment. Russian forces have been pummelling the factory, but the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said the plant need not be stormed. Kyiv has pleaded for a ceasefire to let civilians and wounded soldiers escape. 'They [want to] use the opportunity to capture the defenders of Mariupol, one of the main [elements] of whom are the ... Azov regiment,' Pavlo Kyrylenko, governor of the eastern region of Donetsk, told a briefing, referring to a group of fighters that Moscow has vilified. 'Therefore the Russian side is not agreeing to any evacuation measures regarding wounded [Ukrainian] troops.' Capt Svyatoslav Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov regiment, told Reuters in a video link from an undisclosed location beneath the complex: 'As long as we're here and holding the defence ... the city is not theirs. The tactic [now] is like a medieval siege. We're encircled, they are no longer throwing lots of forces to break our defensive line. They're conducting airstrikes.' Mariupol city council said about 100,000 residents were 'in mortal danger' because of Russian shelling and unsanitary conditions. It said the shortage of drinking water and food was 'catastrophic'. More than 5 million refugees have fled Ukraine since Russia launched its 'special military operation' on 24 February. Moscow says its aim is to disarm its neighbour and defeat nationalists there. The west calls that a bogus pretext for a war of aggression. In another indication that Russia might be planning to expand the scope of its conflict, Kremlin officials again weighed in to denounce 'acts of terrorism' in Moldova's Moscow-backed breakaway region of Transnistria which borders southern Ukraine. 'We are alarmed by the escalation of tensions in Transnistria,' the foreign ministry spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said during her weekly briefing, pointing to reports of shootings and explosions. 'We regard these actions as acts of terrorism aimed at destabilising the situation in the region and expect a thorough and objective investigation,' Zakharova said.", "bc47bb733694eb063932386883ca88e568268ee4f0d10cb6406cf200": "Energy companies in Germany and Hungary have confirmed they intend to comply with Vladimir Putin's demand that buyers of Russian gas pay in roubles. But the EU has said there is a risk the companies would be in breach of sanctions prohibiting transactions with Russia's central bank. The stakes are high because the Kremlin has already switched off supplies to Poland and Bulgaria. Putin said buyers from 'unfriendly' countries must start paying for their gas in roubles. Usually, the vast majority of buyers would pay in euros or dollars. Their bill from Russia's state energy group Gazprom would be deemed settled once the payment went through. Under decree 172, which Putin issued in March, buyers have to take part in a new payment system that requires the opening of two accounts at Gazprombank. Money would be paid into one account in euros and dollars before being converted by the bank into roubles and paid to Gazprom from the second account. Only at that point would the buyer be deemed to have fulfilled its legal obligation to pay for the gas. Hungary has said it is happy with the plan and, according to reports, three of Europe's biggest gas companies - Germany's Uniper, Italy's Eni and Austria's OMV - are also examining ways to comply with Putin's decree. Until this week it was unclear whether Putin would make good on his threat to cut off buyers who refuse his demand. But on Wednesday Gazprom suspended gas supplies to Bulgaria's Bulgargaz and Poland's PGNiG after they declined to pay in roubles. This is where it gets thorny. European leaders, including the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, have said they will not do Putin's bidding. The EU's preliminary analysis, issued earlier this month, found that to do so would be a breach of sanctions imposed on the Kremlin. This is because the currency conversion process at the heart of it involves the Russian central bank, which is under sanctions. 'As the conversion process may take an undefined amount of time, during which time the foreign currency is entirely in the hands of the Russian authorities including the central bank, it may even be considered as a loan granted by EU companies,' the commission said. On Thursday, EU officials confirmed that any company agreeing to open a rouble account in Russia and pay for gas that way would be in breach of sanctions. Possibly. According to further guidance issued by the EU last week, the Kremlin's decree does not stop gas importers asking Gazprom to agree the purchase is legally complete once the first payment, in euros or dollars, has been deposited at Gazprombank. Any conversion into roubles would take place thereafter, meaning the buyer would not technically have breached sanctions. Another option, the guidance says, is for buyers to make a public declaration that they consider the purchase complete once their dollar or euro payment is made. The only obstacle to this, according to the guidance, is the need for 'confirmation from the Russian side' that all of this complies with decree 172. In other words, Gazprom - or effectively the Kremlin - has to be onboard. Gazprom and Gazprombank are not subject to EU sanctions, so buyers are permitted to negotiate such labyrinthine proposals without breaching sanctions. Tactics like these appear to be what the likes of OMV and Uniper are examining. Uniper said it was looking into 'concrete payment modalities' that would allow it to pay while complying with sanctions. This apparent legal loophole significantly clouds the picture over the true nature of compliance with Putin's demand. For instance, responding to reports that OMV was preparing to make rouble payments, the Austrian chancellor, Karl Nehammer, insisted this was not the case. Putin's 'weaponisation' of Russian gas exports is part of a strategy designed to shore up the economy that was announced shortly after the war began. The decision by the west to impose sanctions prompted a sharp fall in the value of the rouble and increased the threat of hyperinflation. In response, Russia imposed strict capital controls under which exporting companies were forced to convert their foreign currency earnings into roubles. Liam Peach, an emerging market economist at Capital Economics, said the capital controls had made the rouble a one-way bet for currency traders, helping to explain why it had recovered to its pre-invasion levels against the dollar. Peach said this week's action against Poland and Bulgaria would not have a major economic impact on Russia. 'European importers will continue to pay Gazprombank in euros, which it will then convert into roubles. It doesn't make a big difference,' he said. 'Politically, Putin is trying to show Russia is standing up to sanctions and is able to apply a bit of pressure.' There are two possible explanations for this. The first is that payments in euros or dollars would add to Russia's foreign currency reserves, which have been frozen since the start of the war. Payment in roubles for Russia's gas supports the economy at a time when it is facing a deep recession. The second reason is that Russia has gradually been moving away from settlement in dollars and euros since it annexed Crimea in 2014. Russia has been seeking to increase payments in roubles and yuan for its energy, and the war in Ukraine has accelerated that trend.", "44db75b5d521355c284b62c00bb5797bb4e4b17e7ff99e19dbf1bf2b": "Beijing has closed schools and suspended weddings and funerals in the city of 22 million in a whirlwind effort to avoid plunging China's capital into a Shanghai-style Covid lockdown. Fears that Beijing could soon be in lockdown have already prompted widespread stockpiling, leading to shortages in some supermarkets. The city's Education Bureau ordered all city schools to end classes from Friday and said it had not determined when they would be able to resume. Beijing has moved faster than other places in China to impose restrictions while case numbers remain low. Authorities announced only 50 new cases on Thursday, bringing the total in the latest wave of infections to about 150. The government is desperate to avoid sweeping measures imposed on Shanghai over the past month, which have caused frustration about shortages of food and basic supplies. Across China, authorities have said they are cracking down on price gouging. On Wednesday, the Ministry of Public Security said any individuals taking advantage of outbreaks to make a profit would be dealt with strictly, with fines of up to 3m yuan (PS363,400). In Shanghai, one man faced punishment for 'fabricating and disseminating price increase information and disrupting market price orders'. He was accused of buying produce and reselling it online at prices increased by up to 360%. Another was accused of renting someone else's business licence and selling produce and food online at inflated prices, making a $230,000 (PS180,000) profit. Last month, Shanghai's market supervision authorities said they had already issued about 20,000 warning letters over price gouging. 'People are in an area without the epidemic, and they came back to the vegetable market today. The price of eggs has gone up, and the price of meat has gone up, and the potatoes are still there, but their value has doubled,' said one Beijing resident on Weibo. 'I didn't panic, but this is urging me to panic.' Authorities have ordered mass testing of more than 20 million people across Beijing this week. As well as city schools, restrictions were placed on some individual residential buildings, office blocks and a university and some public spaces and venues have been closed. Analysts estimate that more than 340 million people in China are under full or partial lockdowns in 46 cities. The southern manufacturing hub of Guangzhou cancelled hundreds of flights and ordered mass testing of about 5.6 million people after it detected one suspected case. Meanwhile, Shanghai reported its lowest daily case numbers in more than three weeks on Thursday, with 9,330 asymptomatic diagnoses. Authorities said they would make more resources available to improve vaccination rates among elderly people, but have not shown signs of lifting the lockdown. The city's 25 million residents have been in lockdown for weeks, with food shortages and delivery disruption. Among the complaints are accusations over the government's insistence on supplying households with millions of doses of Lianhua Qingwen - a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) being used as a Covid-19 treatment. Residents said delivery of the unrequested doses appeared to be prioritised over food. TCM is backed by China's central and local governments and is among the products Beijing has donated to other countries to combat Covid. However, Lianhua Qingwen has become controversial, with signs that criticism of it is not tolerated as authorities seek to contain dissent. Wang Sicong, a well-known figure and son of one of China's richest men, was banned from Weibo and his account shut down on Wednesday after apparently questioning the efficacy of Lianhua Qingwen. In a post to about 40 million followers, Wang had asked whether the product had been approved by the World Health Organization. In a since-deleted post he also reportedly urged China's regulators to investigate the manufacturer, Shijiazhuang Yiling Pharmaceutical. After Wang's post, shares in the company plummeted 35%, Bloomberg reported. A notice on Wang's suspended account said only that it had 'violated related laws and regulations'. Yiling Pharmaceutical said it would take legal action against defamatory statements. On Wednesday, Wang's account was deleted entirely. Wang's posts were among the most high-profile examples of growing discontent in China, as lockdowns and harsh zero-Covid measures continued, especially in Shanghai. The WHO has examined TCM as a treatment, finding 'promising data' that it helped reduce progression of the disease, Quartz reported. But Lianhua Qingwen is not recommended as a Covid-19 treatment, even in some places where TCM is widely used.

In the days since Musk's $44bn (PS34.5bn) acquisition offer was accepted by Twitter's board, hundreds of thousands of users have closed their accounts on the site, the company confirmed, leading to a dip in follower numbers for left-leaning politicians and celebrities such as Barack and Michelle Obama, Taylor Swift and Jeremy Corbyn. Meanwhile, rightwing influencers such as the far-right congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, Boris Johnson and Ted Cruz have all had large gains as new users sign up for the service. In the latest of a series of tweets about the platform Musk hopes to take into private ownership, the world's wealthiest person suggested he would not seek to politicise Twitter. 'For Twitter to deserve public trust it must be politically neutral, which effectively means upsetting the far right and the far left equally,' he tweeted yesterday evening. In earlier comments, Musk has been outspoken about his desire to promote free speech on Twitter, saying that he is 'against censorship that goes far beyond the law'. 'If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect,' Musk added. 'Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people.' His statements have been interpreted as criticism of Twitter's existing moderation policies, particularly those that have affected the US right. The former president Donald Trump was banned from the social network in 2021 for his role in encouraging the storming of the US Capitol, while Greene had her personal account permanently suspended after breaking the platform's five-strike rule. But Musk has argued that his changes would affect all users. 'Attacks are coming thick and fast, primarily from the left, which is no surprise,' he said, in a reply to the rightwing media personality Ben Shapiro. 'However, I should be clear that the right will probably be a little unhappy too. My goal is to maximise area under the curve of total human happiness, which means the ~80% of people in the middle.' The response to the acquisition is not equally distributed, however. Katy Perry, the pop star who is the site's third biggest user, lost 7,000 followers in a few days, while Obama, whose 132 million followers make the former US president's account the most popular on the site, lost 5,000 on Tuesday alone. Followers of the former first lady Michelle Obama are down by nearly 20,000. Cruz, the junior senator for Texas, added more than 60,000 followers, while Greene gained more than 100,000 followers in the last week, a tenfold increase in the normal rate. Followers of Johnson are up by nearly 10,000, but the Twitter account of the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has lost just over 1,000 followers. Some speculated that the changes were the result of action from Twitter 'cleaning house' in preparation for the acquisition, but the social network said they were the result of 'organic' activity. 'While we continue to take action on accounts that violate our spam policy which can affect follower counts, these fluctuations appear to largely be a result of an increase in new account creation and deactivation,' a spokesperson said. Much of Musk's criticism for Twitter's moderation practices has been focused on a single employee, Vijaya Gadde, the company's chief legal officer. His tweets sparked tens of thousands of abusive messages targeted at the executive, and a public rebuke from a former Twitter chief executive, Dick Costolo. 'What's going on?' Costolo tweeted at Musk. 'You're making an executive at the company you just bought the target of harassment and threats.' 'Bullying is not leadership,' he added later, to which Musk replied, 'What are talking about? I'm just saying Twitter needs to be politically neutral.' The social media platform admitted in its first quarter results on Thursday that it had overstated its user numbers by nearly 2 million between the first quarter of 2019 and the last quarter of 2021. Twitter said the miscount in monetisable daily active users was down to an error in a feature that allowed people to link multiple separate accounts together to conveniently switch between them.  The company had 229 million daily users in the first quarter of the year, up from 214.7 million in the previous three months. The rise was slightly higher than analysts had expected. In what may be one of its final earnings reports as a public company, Twitter also announced its revenue rose to $1.2bn in the first quarter, up from $1.04bn a year earlier but slightly lower than forecasted. On Thursday, the Federal Trade Commission, is looking into whether Musk complied with an antitrust reporting requirement when he bought his stake in the Twitter earlier this month, Reuters reported, citing the Information. The inquiry is attempting to determine if Musk bought the stake to influence Twitter's management or if he looked to be a passive shareholder.", "574c124831c9e52c62dd18e15a009e2e4797cc8d54f685ec7e8412dd": "The Sun attempted to expose Jimmy Savile as a paedophile while he was still alive, only to have to back down because of Britain's tough libel laws, according to one of the journalists who investigated the case. Meirion Jones said the tabloid was ready to publish the story in 2008, which could have brought the entertainer to justice. The newspaper's reporters had signed affidavits from women who had been abused as children by Savile at the notorious Haut de la Garenne children's home in Jersey. In an article for the Guardian, Jones said the Sun's journalists and editors had confidence in the evidence that Savile had abused individuals on the island. However, the tabloid's lawyers were worried they would lose any subsequent libel case and be left with a PS1m bill, partly because the victims might not be believed in court. Jones said the newspaper knew Savile was highly litigious and if they published a story they 'would be facing the best QCs money could buy, representing a man who could potentially call Prince Charles, Margaret Thatcher, the heads of charities, the head of the BBC and the pope as character witnesses.' The journalist, who features in a recent Netflix documentary about Savile, said: 'The best guess of the lawyers was that a libel action could cost PS1m and the Sun would definitely lose. The story was canned and the journalists and editors were furious. But this wasn't the first or last time that Savile escaped because of our libel laws, which rewarded his deliberate targeting of vulnerable victims.' Instead, the Sun published a carefully worded article about child abuse at the Jersey care home, along with a picture of Savile on the premises - while repeatedly emphasising that the BBC presenter had no knowledge of what happened there. Despite this, Savile's lawyers still threatened legal action. A copy of a letter sent to the Sun in 2008, seen by the Guardian, was written on behalf of the presenter by Fox Hayes Solicitors, a Leeds business that is now defunct. Emphasising the 'huge sums' that Savile's charity work had raised for children, the lawyers demanded the Sun issue a prominent statement 'making clear that any visit to the home was entirely innocent', delete the article from its website, and pay Savile compensation 'for the injury to his feelings and reputation'. The legal firm said child abuse was the 'antithesis of everything he [Savile] has worked tirelessly to prevent'. They insisted the entertainer did not remember visiting children at the care home in the 1970s and that 'any such visit would have been unexceptional save for the pleasure it may have given'. After Savile's death in 2011, hundreds of his victims came forward. The public eventually learned that one of Britain's most famous light entertainment stars was also one of the country's most prolific paedophiles. Jones, now editor of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, helped to tell the victims' stories, but only after BBC bosses blocked his initial investigation from appearing on Newsnight, in one of the corporation's worst scandals. He is now urging the government to reform Britain's libel laws to make it easier for investigative stories to be published, warning they have been used by people ranging from Savile to major corporations and Russian oligarchs to avoid scrutiny. The justice secretary, Dominic Raab, is currently overseeing a review of the relevant legislation. A spokesperson for the Sun declined to comment.", "315edfcb33d9dc182e11fca8a00d45c6e24c614dfa9604c486614c0e": "A vast blanket of foul-smelling toxic foam has overflowed a polluted river near the Colombian capital Bogota, covering homes and businesses, and sending residents fleeing from cloud-like fragments as they drift through the streets. 'The smell is terrible - [and] we've had to put up with this foam for a long time,' community leader Luz Mariela Gomez told local television channels. 'We're running a risk. Someone could fall down there and we won't be able to find them.' Photographs from the residential suburb Mosquera showed immense drifts of pungent foam burying pavements and towering over residents. One road to a school was blocked. Local environmental authorities said that the polluted foam - which has been seen in the town several times over the past few years - is increasing because of people dumping waste, chemicals and detergents into the river system. Heavy rains have added to the problem. The Mosquera mayor's office tweeted photos of the toxic foam, alongside town officials. The mayor, Gian Gerometta, claimed that the buildup of pollution was partly due to a blockage caused by plants in the river. 'We are aware of the risks that can arise due to this phenomenon,' he tweeted . Authorities also warned locals against getting too close to the foam, which is thought to cause respiratory problems and skin irritations. 'It is important that children are kept away as we do not yet totally know what this material is,' Edwin Garcia, a government environmental official, told local radio station Caracol, adding that a treatment plant in the region has been working to decontaminate the river since 2020. 'We will be monitoring and cleaning the entire river to prevent foam from continuing to accumulate.'", "7dbaf06b58c1b7bf63ff6c77a30124ec400fab9237e7c3daf2531d4d": "Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally party has turned its attention to June's parliamentary elections after its defeat in the presidential contest, vowing to field candidates in every constituency and claiming the electoral system is stacked against it. 'We've been preparing for a very long time for these elections,' said the acting party president, Jordan Bardella. 'It's essential our ideas are defended in the assembly.' He said his party would take a stand on security, immigration and French identity issues in parliament, as well as taxes. 'People have to vote,' he said on the CNews TV channel. 'We need an opposition.' Le Pen was beaten by the centrist Emmanuel Macron in Sunday's presidential election by 58.5% to 41.5%, but she gained a historic score for the far right, with more than 13m votes. She will run again in the parliamentary elections in June and is likely to keep her seat in the Pas-de-Calais area in northern France. Her party has in the past struggled to translate its high number of votes in the presidential election into seats in parliament. This is partly due to a two-round parliamentary voting system that does not favour small parties, as well tactical voting to keep out the far right. Abstention is also traditionally far higher in parliamentary elections than in presidential elections, which has had a negative impact on the National Rally's results. In 2017, the year of the last parliamentary election, Le Pen won more than 10m votes in the presidential final against Macron, but weeks later her party and its associated lawmakers won only eight seats in the 577-seat parliament. The party believes its chances are better this June because last Sunday's presidential vote showed Le Pen had expanded her support across a greater geographical area, including a strong showing in the south-east as well as the north and north-east. 'We're in a very different situation this time because we arrived first in 159 constituencies [in the presidential vote] compared to 45 in 2017,' said Gilles Pennelle, a party delegate who is expected to be a candidate in Brittany. The party has not fixed a public target of how many seats it wants to win. Several party figures have said they hope to win at least enough to form a parliamentary grouping, which would mean at least 15 seats. A National Rally parliamentary grouping, if headed by Le Pen, would give her a bigger platform and higher visibility, useful if she decides to run for a fourth time for the presidency in 2027, which is not yet clear. In recent parliamentary elections that follow the presidential vote, the party of the newly elected president has always won a majority. A poll on Monday by Harris Interactive suggested Macron would secure a ruling majority, winning 326 to 366 seats out of 577, if he manages to strike a broad centre-right alliance with smaller parties including the rightwing Les Republicains. But an Elabe poll on Wednesday found that 61% of French people wanted a parliamentary majority that was opposed to Macron. The radical leftwinger Jean-Luc Melenchon is attempting to form an alliance of parties on the left in an attempt to gain a maximum of seats. His party, France Unbowed, currently has 17 seats in parliament.", "99950919526c1a77eee599f9e75ced5d822b2106a656633e12ddc3b8": "The man sported a stripy Marks & Spencer tie, expensively made but possibly secondhand shoes - and 6 kg of cast-iron weights tied around his body, designed to drag him to the bottom of the North Sea. Almost three decades after finding the body of what appeared to be a murder victim in the waters off the island of Heligoland, German police have released new information and a first photofit in order to establish the identity of the man who was dubbed 'the Gentleman' for his smart attire. Researchers at Staffordshire and Plymouth Marjon universities, in cooperation with the German Police Academy of Lower Saxony and the missing persons charity Locate International, have been collaborating on the cold case with the intention of uncovering the man's name and bringing his killers to justice. After exhuming the man's body last December, they have managed to isolate the complete DNA profile of the 45- to 50-year-old male and are currently checking it against international DNA databases, police in Wilhelmshaven in northern Germany announced on Thursday. An ongoing isotope analysis could eventually confirm whether the man had lived on the British Isles before his body was dumped in the North Sea, as investigators suspect. The body was recovered from the sea by a border guard boat on 11 July 1994, 20 km off Heligoland, but police believe it is possible that the body had travelled in the water for some distance. 'He could have drifted from a ship or even as far as [from] Great Britain, that's certainly possible,' said Karsten Bettels, of the Lower Saxony Police Academy. An autopsy at the time showed signs of exposure to blunt violence on the almost 2 metre-tall (6ft 5in) man's head and upper body, which he had suffered while still alive. A further telling sign of a criminal act were the two cast-iron shoe lasts, each weighing 3 kg, which had been fixed to the man's body to weigh him down, as police have revealed for the first time. Made in the 1920s or 30s, the two female shoe lasts were embossed with the initials AJK, the trademark of Bristol-based company AJ Jackson. Police have also for the first time released the make of the man's tie, saying it was produced by Marks & Spencer for the English- and French-language market, which at the time of the man's disappearance stretched all the way to Canada. Suspicions that the distinctive green, yellow and blue stripes marked the man out as belonging to a specific organisation had not been confirmed, police said. German police are seeking further information on the possible identity of the man from the public, having received over 50 pieces of information since appealing to the press in February. Another reason they have gone public again is to correct the victim's misleading 'gentleman' moniker, which was based on his elegant outfit and expensive shoes. 'Against the backdrop of the latest information this impression has to be relativised,' police said. The M&S tie was a mass-market product and the shoes had been previously repaired and may have been bought secondhand, they said. 'It cannot be necessarily assumed that the dead person was wealthy,' German police said in a statement.", "20f0837416837e947a857cdd813a3b3145be8d836b85dbf1b273ab9e": "Boris Johnson is under increasing pressure to take immediate disciplinary action against the Conservative MP accused of watching pornography in the House of Commons. The chief whip issued a statement on Wednesday suggesting the matter should be referred to parliament's Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS), which deals with sexual harassment and other disciplinary matters. But senior Tories questioned why he had not taken action directly against the MP, whose alleged behaviour was witnessed by two female colleagues in recent months. The identity of the MP is known to party whips, it is understood, but sources denied suggestions the MP was himself a whip. One cabinet minister described the situation as 'madness all round', while Caroline Nokes, the chair of the women and equalities committee, said: 'I hope the chief withdraws the whip. In any other workplace they would be on gardening leave.' Chris Heaton-Harris, the chief whip, was present at a meeting of the '2022 committee' - a group of Tory women - earlier this week, when a series of incidents, including the MP watching pornography, were described. On Thursday the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, called on Johnson to bypass the potentially lengthy ICGS process, and discipline the MP directly. 'This is an unusual case because the Tory party knows who this individual is. I think that they should deal with it, and deal with it sooner rather than later ... They know who this is. They should take action now,' he said. Misogyny and sexism in parliament have come under close scrutiny in recent days, after a widely criticised Mail on Sunday story claimed Tory MPs believed Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, crossed and uncrossed her legs to distract Johnson at prime minister's questions. Asked whether the MP accused of watching pornography should lose the whip, the prime minister insisted on Thursday that the case should be investigated independently. It was 'obviously unacceptable for anybody to be doing that kind of thing in the workplace' but 'what needs to happen now is that the proper procedures need to be gone through, the independent complaints and grievances procedure needs to be activated and we need to get to understand the facts,' Johnson said. A spokesperson for the whips' office said: 'This is the best way of handling this, because they can look at everything fairly, independently. This is the best process that we could have in place to deal with this matter.' At least five cabinet ministers have expressed alarm privately or publicly about the reports. Earlier in the day, the attorney general, Suella Braverman, said some MPs behaved like 'animals', and talked about a 'coarsening' of behaviour in parliament and elsewhere. 'I think this is something that does happen in many, if not all, workplaces, where a small minority of men - and it is men - are behaving in an unacceptable way,' she told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour. 'I think that's actually a more worrying symptom of our society and our culture. How have we got to a place in our society where watching pornography on the tube, in public, in front of children, in parliament, in the workplace has become somehow normalised for some people?' Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, told the BBC: 'I've been around a while and I think it's actually getting worse [for female MPs] ... I always thought that, get more women in ... things will get better, but sadly I don't see that happening at the moment. I think we just need to have a majority of women maybe. So it's just disappointing.' Sajid Javid, the health secretary, said: 'There have been several instances of inappropriate and sexist behaviour recently in parliament. It is shameful. Parliamentarians are public servants and it is their duty to set an example of character and integrity. The culture of Westminster needs to change.'", "8350f94409eec59058534af9ad9569bb6294f9a112682108409aa338": "The Snapchat founder, Evan Spiegel, has dismissed Facebook's 'metaverse' ambitions as 'ambiguous and hypothetical' as he announced a raft of new augmented reality features coming to phones and Snap's experimental AR Spectacles over the next year. Speaking ahead of the Snap Partner Summit, the company's flagship annual event, Spiegel argued Snapchat was uniquely placed to guide the next decade of technology thanks to the company's vast array of augmented reality services, such as the 'lenses' that are used by millions of people every day. With 332 million daily users and a market cap of $46.95bn (PS38bn), Snap is comfortably larger than Twitter, even after the acquisition offer for the latter from Elon Musk, but gets a fraction of the attention. 'That's something that sort of comes along with them being the 'public town square',' Spiegel says. 'We're happy with the value that we provide to our community - and society.' He cites statistics that 'over 90% of Snapchatters say they feel comfortable, happy, and connected when they use Snapchat', which is 'ranked the No 1 happiest platform when compared to other apps'. 'There's now like 250 million people engaging with AR everyday on the smartphone alone,' Spiegel said. 'And that's on this tiny little screen that you're looking through and you're using your thumbs on. So we believe that trying to break some of those constraints, and go into a truly immersive and interactive AR experience, will be really important in the future.' Snap's latest Spectacles have only shipped in prototype form to creators around the world: with a 15- to 30-minute battery life and a severely restricted display, they are intended to inspire creators with the possibility of future versions of the same hardware. But, Spiegel says, the next generation is already in development. 'It just changes the way you interact when you can walk around and use your hands, and see computing brought to life. The strength of our AR glasses is the AR platform behind it, met with hundreds of hundreds of thousands of developers, millions of lenses, and really, really advanced tools that continue to evolve rapidly.' Core to that evolution is an update called Lens Cloud that lets developers for both Snapchat and Spectacles build AR experiences that are firmly placed in the real world. One set of tools lets Lenses be anchored to any location around the world: Lego has used it to build virtual ferris wheels, rollercoasters and slides around the streets of central London. Another feature lets two users of the same AR lens interact with each other for the first time, occupying the same virtual spaces and playing the same games. The updates sound like they could be the foundations of a shared virtual universe of the type that Facebook recently decided was so fundamental to its future that it even rebranded the company as Meta. But, Spiegel says, the word 'metaverse' is never uttered in Snap's offices. 'The reason why we don't use that word is because it's pretty ambiguous and hypothetical. Just ask a room of people how to define it, and everyone's definition is totally different. 'But one of the big overarching concepts people have is that a lot of those tools are designed to replace reality. Whereas when we talk about AR, we're trying to augment the real world around you. So our fundamental bet is that people actually love the real world: they want to be together in person with their friends. 'And, of course, our vision is real today, with glasses that you can use today, and a platform that works at scale today. So we try to stay away from those hypotheticals, because we're focused on what we're building right now.' Spiegel also revealed Pixy, 'the world's friendliest flying camera' - a palm-sized autonomous drone that can be used to capture outdoor activities. With a single button to control it, users just hold Pixy in their hand and select one of five modes, including 'follow' - the drone will recognise and follow its owner taking video on the way - and 'reveal' - the drone will fly to its maximum altitude and film the reverse pan as it goes. 'Everything you need to capture the spontaneity and fun of the moment from new perspectives is right in the palm of your hand,' Spiegel said. 'There are no controllers. There's no complex set-up. Simply select a flight path and let Pixy take it from there, floating above you as it captures photos and videos. And it knows when and where to return, landing gently in the palm of your hand.' The device is available for purchase from Thursday for $229.99 to customers in the US and France.", "ad4b95f31e25ff107c7c4b256f30cd99384c285026326347571ecba3": "A Samsung advertisement featuring a woman jogging alone at 2am has been criticised as 'unrealistic' and insensitive. The ad, titled Night Owls, which was promoting the Galaxy Watch4, Galaxy Buds 2 and Galaxy S22 phone, features a young woman running at 2am, with earbuds in, through dark streets and alleyways. At one point she runs past a man on a bike on a deserted bridge.While the young woman is running, the voiceover says: 'Sleep at night. Run faster. Push harder. Follow the herd. Not for me, I run on a different schedule: mine.' The advert comes after the death of 23-year-old Ashling Murphy, who was attacked while out running along a canal near Tullamore, west of Dublin, earlier this year, and the murders of Sarah Everard and Sabina Nessa. Jamie Klingler, the co-founder of Reclaim These Streets, said the ad was 'completely and utterly tone deaf, especially in light of Ashling Murphy'. 'It's the Kendall Jenner Pepsi moment for Samsung. It isn't safe for us to run at night and the last thing I want is for anyone to violate our space while we are trying to exercise. It's almost laughable how bad this ad lands,' she said. Klingler said it was difficult to imagine a woman who would feel safe running at that time of night, and that was what made the ad 'beyond unrealistic'. Sahra-Isha Muhammad-Jones, the founder and head of partnerships of Asra running club, a group for Muslim women, said: 'There seems to be an unawareness of how unsafe it is for women running at this time. As a woman who is running, it's not safe already, but as a Black Muslim woman, it's even more unsafe. This advert felt like what would happen in an ideal world.' 'It can be triggering for women watching this advert and then having to come to terms with what is actually happening in reality to women in this country.' Muhammad-Jones added that the advert felt like a missed opportunity to spark a meaningful discussion on women's safety. 'My first reaction was to laugh. The ad is completely unrealistic and totally blinkered,' says Esther Newman, the editor of Women's Running magazine. 'We have worked for years on the issues of women's safety when it comes to running and the vast majority of women in our audience have felt unsafe whilst running, from heckling to actual abuse. We know that women often think about stopping running because of this,' says Newman. 'Women feel unsafe when it comes to running at any point of the day. Seeing a woman choosing to run at 2am, with headphones, it's just ludicrous.' Newman said that the ad was not empowering and instead was 'shortsighted, naive and comical'. Samsung said: 'The Night Owls campaign was designed with a positive message in mind: to celebrate individuality and freedom to exercise at all hours. 'It was never our intention to be insensitive to ongoing conversations around women's safety. As a global company with a diverse workforce, we apologise for how this may have been received.'", "f768bf54a3e8509ac6c620313fd3ca3dc287e469466b2a2bd8c19b86": "", "1a5c8fbb68a0a4000c24d4d1a93a2ed41938e931db00c8baaf5ee4e3": "", "4c0313144d9f7abec04c5b318220c53c13c231a61c88945dabc44d5e": "", "3d8c4633975fd7b9838617f8d8bbbdc7bc1a1d52a33106bc71013249": "", "86f982a2872d0bba93e227d74304a9a18dbf85ef9c794aaa11e6a64b": "", "472d670d8185edcf467ab016d0fa766821780f97bf84e29afa59832e": "", "0eff97ad62970a06c0edf1739ffb003885b2dc9216965d66435d13f1": "", "579e738d8493bbd872ad9309b0de61dd24e842f9f17813179c09dbe2": "", "f636d23499ffa4610b513aa73f2d06e9d1c4e674088c372717293b80": "", "c31eb0e16b024b770555015115ccb502e7131ca5d1296c696fda9a5c": "", "85068926f934510070f82f3430e81ef3533ddb46dfdd23d03eb7611e": "", "7030b3125b747cd70212e3500b048173002adad93faef95beeecb2b3": "", "51dce8bd300175059eece5a42565c0d7cbea5dff3dbd2f53ac895060": "", "1c38c7b30676094a9a4e6d6f5227e9d7a7dce1fcaf5571654f0b1f16": "", "7f6b0df3d16c8712d2f1726fcd1c2043e58464a83868d31b631110ff": "", "3d2ed4d87c86aa3fe062b8a4acd2573d88ab9ba9ce62c1515a339173": "", "a770ff051e7373805e4c14a641ba6a4dfe02e7dfea30f9b50b076b3e": "", "40c3946fa29f2a99933900216bea2e83fbfe1022921bd23402719dbc": "", "775acc42e3d6ef992786753f15c690999291654fbe206ea8c3f085b7": "", "4b32a5165a601b950d9c7c4a04ede5e2eff746befd850a21f61d8b54": "", "2f45354f05d58453f73b8c870a08fd3d97c293fb21fe79698f680664": "", "6d2d9f6cfd1672ac5320167c9f79461095f9aa42a83a433d459d4d23": "", "95120e26d269a75282ba53a9f55cfbf96e857044fc509ca507f5b7cd": "", "a16b5f7a9c3c0be6d3fd1394d94b92e33b02cbc616122344659be54d": "The number of coal-fired power plants under development around the world fell last year, but far too much coal is still being burned and too many new coal-fired power plants are planned for the world to stay within safe temperature limits.

The number of countries planning new plants also fell, from 41 at the beginning of 2021 to 34 countries. But these encouraging signs were outweighed by a slowdown in older coal-fired power stations being taken out of service. About 25GW of capacity was taken out - roughly equal to the amount of new capacity commissioned in China - and the amount of electricity generated from coal rose by 9% in 2021 to a record high, more than rebounding from a 4% fall in 2020 when Covid first struck. The authors of the report concluded that 'coal's last gasp is not yet in sight', despite countries agreeing at the Cop26 UN climate summit last November to a 'phase down' of coal. Last year, the International Energy Agency warned that no new exploration of fossil fuels of any kind could take place if the world was to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The continuing use of coal comes despite ever starker warnings from scientists in the latest assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which concluded that the world would far exceed the 1.5C limit without rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Flora Champenois of Global Energy Monitor, one of the report's authors, said: 'The coal plant pipeline is shrinking, but there is simply no carbon budget left to be building new coal plants. We need to stop now. The latest IPCC report's directive for a fighting chance at a livable climate is clear - stop building new coal plants and retire existing ones in the developed world by 2030, and the rest of the world soon after.' The war in Ukraine has also taken a toll, pushing up gas prices and making coal cheaper by comparison, tempting companies and countries to burn more of the dirtiest fuel. But Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst for the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, and another co-author of the report, said there could also be an upside in that many countries - particularly in Europe - were looking to reform their energy systems to accelerate clean energy and emphasise energy efficiency. 'It's really important to note how much movement there has been towards clean energy and efficiency in response to the invasion,' he said. Weakening demand in China was also dampening the prospects of a further coal revival, he added. The country's response to the current resurgence of Covid-19, and to the uncertain global economy, would be crucial. 'The question is whether China does go for the high-quality economic growth that the leadership has been talking about.' China has commissioned more new coal-fired power than the rest of the world combined since the Covid-19 pandemic started, but the Chinese government's plans for increasing clean electricity production by 2025 should mean that less coal is used, even if new coal-fired power plants are built there. But the building of such plants must be controlled much more strictly, according to the report, or growing over-capacity could hurt the country's transition. Globally, there are still more than 2,400 coal-fired power plants operating in 79 countries, making a total of nearly 2,100 GW of capacity. Only 170 plants are not covered by an eventual phase-out date or carbon-neutrality target, but too few are scheduled to retire in time to stay within 1.5C.", "d53a386b0cfc0a2579b90acbc16fee5c42f97c1ca8f9665f64c69949": "In 2019, Ikea announced it had developed curtains that it claimed could 'break down common indoor air pollutants'. The secret, it said, was the fabric's special coating. 'What if we could use textiles to clean the air?' asked Ikea's product developer, Mauricio Affonso, in a promotional video for the 'Gunrid' curtains. After explaining that the coating was a photocatalyst ('similar to photosynthesis, found in nature'), Affonso is shown gazing up at the gauzy curtains while uplifting music plays. 'It's amazing to work on something that can give people the opportunity to live a healthier life at home.'Puzzled by these claims - how could a mineral coating clean the air? - Avicenn, a French environmental nonprofit organisation, investigated. Independent laboratory tests of the Gunrid textile reported that samples contained tiny particles of titanium dioxide (TiO2) - a substance not normally toxic but which can be possibly carcinogenic if inhaled, and potentially in other forms - which supposedly gives 'self-cleaning' properties to things such as paint and windows when exposed to sunlight. These tiny particles, or nanoparticles, are at the forefront of materials science. Nanoparticles come in all shapes - spheres, cubes, fibres or sheets - but the crucial thing is their size: they are smaller than 100 nanometres (a human hair is approximately 80,000nm thick). Many nanoparticles exist in nature. Nano-hairs make a gecko's feet sticky, and nano-proteins make a spider's silk strong. But they can be manufactured, and because they are so small, they have special properties that make them attractive across a range of endeavours - not just to companies such as Ikea. In medicine, they can transport cancer drugs directly into tumour cells, and nanosilver is used to coat medical breathing tubes and bandages. Nanos could direct pesticides to parts of a plant, or release nutrients from fertilisers in a more controlled manner. They also have more mundane uses. Synthetic nanos are added to cosmetics and food. Nanosilver is used in textiles, where it is claimed to give antibacterial properties to plasters, gym leggings, yoga mats and period pants.  But scientists such as those at Avicenn are concerned that when these household items get washed, recycled or thrown away, synthetic nanos are released into the environment - making their way into the soil and sea in ways that are still not understood. Some scientists believe nanoparticles could pose an even greater threat than microplastics. Synthetic nano particles of plastic have been found in the ocean and in ice on both poles. Nanoparticles from socks and sunscreen have been found to pollute water, and certain nanos have been shown to negatively affect marine wildlife including fish and crustaceans. As with antibiotics, resistance to antimicrobial nanosilver can develop - silver-tolerant soil bacteria have now been found. Little is known even about where nanoparticles are, let alone their effects on the environment. As they are so tiny, most experiments are conducted in labs, and it can be hard to pin down where they are applied. 'The main problem with these substances is that we cannot measure them - we know they are there but they're so tiny they're difficult to detect, which is why you don't hear as much about them,' says Nick Voulvoulis, professor of environmental technology at Imperial College London. He worries about the uncontrolled use of nanos in consumer products. 'If nanos are used properly in applications that are useful or beneficial, that's justified, but if they are used anywhere and everywhere because they have certain properties, that's crazy.' Synthetic nanoparticles are not inherently harmful. Like their natural cousins, many are metal-based, but they can be made of any substance. Crucially, unlike chemical compounds, they cannot be dissolved. Their tiny size gives them, paradoxically, an enormous surface area, which makes them behave differently to 'non-nano' versions of the same material. It can make them more mobile, more reactive - and potentially more toxic, depending on shape, size, type, how a substance is released into the environment and its concentration. And released into the environment they are, on a massive scale. According to Avicenn, the release of nanos is most likely during manufacture or disposal, but it can also happen when items are washed - which is known to occur with fabrics containing nanosilver. Sewage systems cannot trap them and they end up in the ocean: the OECD says even advanced wastewater-treatment plants cannot deal with nanoparticles. From a health perspective, inhalation is the most harmful route of exposure to nanos such as TiO2 for factory workers and consumers. Avicenn's tests concluded that the average particle size was 4.9nm, and all 300 particles analysed were below the official nano threshold of 100nm. Ikea insisted its own tests showed the TiO2 particles were 'properly bound to the fabric' and 'pose no risk' to customers, and said it took workers' safety extremely seriously. The firm has not referred to them as nanoparticles, and said that once integrated into textile surfaces there was 'no good standard method to measure the particle size distribution of a material', acknowledging that EU definitions of nanomaterials were under review. 'We recognise that the tests and measurements of nano-particles are complex, especially for materials containing particles that tend to form agglomerates,' it said. As for Ikea's curtains shedding TiO2 nanoparticles when washed or discarded, Ikea said it was 'confident that the treatment is properly bound to the fabric, and therefore we do not see a risk of inhaling the treatment', but acknowledged that 'as with any textile, parts of the textile can come off during use or washing'. Many nanos do not persist for long in the environment. However, because they are consistently being discharged, levels remain fairly constant. 'Nanos are 'pseudo-persistent' because they degrade quite quickly but they keep entering the environment,' Voulvoulis says. His main concern is whether nanos become carriers for other compounds, a subject of scientific debate. In 2009, Spanish scientists suggested nanos could bind to and transport toxic pollutants, and possibly be toxic themselves by generating reactive free radicals. If other toxic pollutants 'latch on' to nanos' surfaces, they argued, marine plants and animals could absorb them more easily. Other scientists suggest the opposite: that organic matter in sewage coat nanoparticles, rendering them less active. And others fear nanos could trigger 'toxic cocktail' effects - making them more harmful in combination than individual substances would be separately. So far, synthetic nanomaterials are relatively dispersed in the sea, and unlikely to significantly affect marine animals, says Dr Tobias Lammel of Gothenburg University, who has studied copper nanos. But he warns: 'It's possible that the concentration of some manufactured nanomaterials in the marine environment will increase ... It is important to keep an eye on this.' Given the huge question marks, Avicenn wants more stringent regulations on nanos, and more caution in product design. 'Companies are eager to sell innovative and fancy products, but they must thoroughly assess their benefits-risks balance at each step of the life-cycle of the products,' says Mathilde Detcheverry, Avicenn's policy manager. From August, the EU will ban use of TiO2 nanos in food (where it is called E171) and the European Commission recently announced that 12 nanomaterials would soon be prohibited in cosmetics.  Detcheverry says: 'As scientific knowledge about the environmental and health impacts of engineered nanos such as silver and titanium dioxide advances, we need to make sure nanos are only allowed for specific and essential uses in order to minimise any adverse effects at the source and [ensure they are] not released uncontrollably.'  Two years after the release of Ikea's Gunrid curtains, Avicenn tried to buy more for further tests, but they had been withdrawn from sale. Ikea told the Guardian that Gunrid remained 'safe to use as a traditional curtain' but it was withdrawn because 'the functionality was not as effective as expected'. If that's true - for example, that despite TiO2 having proven photocatalytic properties and being used in self-cleaning and air-purifying products, its efficacy on curtains could be localised and not powerful - then at the very least Ikea's experience suggests nanoparticles' benefits may not outweigh the potential and frequently unknown risks, Detcheverry says. 'Nanoparticles are often promoted as silver bullets against pollution or bacteria,' she says, 'but we must make sure that the cure is not worse than the disease.' Gunrid was just one product of many thousands that use nanoparticles. As Ikea's Affonso says in the video: 'What's so great about Gunrid is that this technology could be applied to any textile.'", "0aa3ce959a91610968556c857a3b38b322e1d492c8385e21e533587c": "Pristine rainforests were once again destroyed at a relentless rate in 2021, according to new figures, prompting concerns governments will not meet a Cop26 deal to halt and reverse deforestation by the end of the decade. From the Brazilian Amazon to the Congo basin, the tropics lost 11.1m hectares of tree cover last year, including 3.75m ha of primary forest critical to limiting global heating and biodiversity loss. Boreal forests, mainly in Russia, experienced a record loss in 2021 driven by the worst wildfire season in Siberia since records began, according to new data from the University of Maryland released via Global Forest Watch. Experts called the continued forest loss a disaster for action on global heating and said the 143 governments that pledged to halt and reverse forest loss by 2030 at Cop26 held in Glasgow, had to urgently make good on their commitment. Of the primary rainforest that was lost in 2021 - releasing the equivalent of India's annual fossil fuel emissions - 40% disappeared in Brazil, with the Democratic Republic of Congo, Bolivia, Indonesia and Peru making up the rest of the top five. Despite the persistent loss of forests, experts pointed to signs of hope in the new figures. Indonesia reduced primary forest loss for a fifth straight year following government action on palm oil, fire management and an updated national climate plan which committed the country to becoming a carbon sink by 2030. Malaysia has also reduced primary forest lost in recent years, and experts pointed to the examples of Gabon and the Guyanas, that have had very low rates of forest loss over the last two decades. Rod Taylor, the global director of the forests programme at the World Resources Institute (WRI), which compiled the report, said while the global rates of forest loss appeared to be flatlining, they needed to dramatically decrease for the world to meet climate targets. 'When you look at unchanging year-on-year statistics, you could conclude that they don't really offer a newsworthy headline. But when it comes to the loss of primary tropical forests, stubbornly persistent rates relate to the climate, the extinction crisis and the fate of many first peoples. High rates of loss continue despite pledges from countries and companies,' Taylor said. Wildfires, rising temperatures and land clearances are affecting the resilience of forests around the world. Warnings point to parts of the Amazon being in danger of converting from rainforest to savannah. According to the figures there was a particularly worrying spike in deforestation in the western Brazilian Amazon, linked to large-scale clearing for cattle pastures along existing roads. When approached for comment by the Guardian, a spokesperson for the Brazilian government said they were committed to the Glasgow forest agreement aimed at eliminating illegal deforestation by 2028, and had dedicated extra resources to meeting the target. The expansion of small-scale agriculture and harvesting of trees to meet energy demands drove forest loss in the DRC last year, while Bolivia experienced record primary forest loss due to agriculture and fires, including in protected areas. Frances Seymour, a senior fellow at the WRI, said the 2021 figures had to be taken as a baseline for assessing the Cop26 pledges, but underscored that dramatic action was needed, warning that countries that were taking action were not receiving enough financial support. Seymour said: 'We've got 20 years of data showing the persistent annual loss of millions of hectares of primary tropical forests alone. But we don't run out of fingers counting the number of years we have left to bring that number down to zero. We already knew that such losses are a disaster for the climate. They're a disaster for biodiversity. They're a disaster for Indigenous peoples and local communities. 'We have to dramatically reduce emissions from all sources. No one should even think any more about planting trees instead of reducing emissions from fossil fuels. It's got to be both and it's got to be now before it's too late.'  The UK environment minister Lord Goldsmith, who played a key role in the agreement at Cop26 of 143 countries to halt and reverse deforestation, said the figures were a stark reminder of the need for governments to make good on their commitments. 'If we continue to degrade the world's great forests, from the Amazon to the Congo basin, the implications for millions of people are terrible. We are derailing complex natural systems we all depend on, and that in turn makes meeting any of our shared global goals, from peace to prosperity, impossible,' he said.

Unveiling a series of measures to tackle organised crime after violent riots over the Easter weekend that left more than 100 police injured, Magdalena Andersson said Islamism and rightwing extremism had been allowed to fester in Sweden. 'Segregation has been allowed to go so far that we have parallel societies in Sweden,' the Social Democrat prime minister told a news conference. 'We live in the same country but in completely different realities. We will have to reassess our previous truths and make tough decisions.' Integration had been 'too poor, at the same time as we have experienced very substantial levels of immigration', Andersson added. 'Society has been too weak, resources for the police and social services have been too weak.' The number of people living in Sweden who were born abroad has doubled over the past 20 years to about 2 million, or one-fifth of the population. Andersson said it was 'crucial to prevent more children and young people from being drawn into crime'. She said she aimed to introduce local 'youth delinquency boards', in which social services and police would collaborate closely, in addition to putting in place tools to ensure young people stayed in school and off the streets. The justice and home affairs minister, Morgan Johansson, outlined plans to give the police greater electronic surveillance powers, facilitate the exchange of information between authorities, and deny residence even to people not yet convicted of a crime. 'What we saw were no political protests,' Andersson said of the riots. 'Police were attacked with stones and molotov cocktails. It was not a political act, it was a criminal act - an attack on the democracy that many have actually fled to.' The riots erupted after a notorious anti-immigrant provocateur, the Danish-Swedish politician Rasmus Paludan, threatened to tour the country burning the Qur'an. Police clashed with groups of mostly masked young men in several towns and cities. Police insisted they had to grant permits for Paludan's incendiary events, planned mainly in areas with large Muslim populations, because of the country's liberal freedom of speech laws, but Johansson said those freedoms were being abused by 'extremists' to foster 'hate, division and violence'. Dozens of people were arrested after three days of rioting in Norrkoping, Linkoping, Landskrona, Orebro, Malmo and the capital, Stockholm. A school was also set alight and 20 police vehicles either damaged or destroyed.

Paul Hendrik van Zyl, was arrested on Tuesday after 'firing shots in the direction of the woman', Ramokone Linah, who was fishing with her partner in a river in Lephalale town, northern Limpopo province. Van Zyl faces attempted murder charges, according to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). 'The arrested suspect alleged that he was shooting at the animals' police spokesperson, Mamphaswa Seabi, said in a statement. Linah, 38, sustained gun shot wounds on her arm, while her partner 'managed to hide' before informing police and emergency services, police said. The accused 'is the owner of the farm where the incident occurred', said Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi, NPA spokesperson in the province. Police seized two rifles, one revolver, one pistol, and two airguns during the arrest. Deep racial divisions remain in South Africa 28 years after the end of white minority apartheid rule, and such incidents frequently cause outrage. According to one local media report, the victim was part of a group of local men and women who had been fishing in a river near Mamojela Park, an informal settlement outside the mining town of Lephalale, since mid-morning. The shooting occurred in the early afternoon. Witnesses said van Zyl had fired at the group from the other riverbank and had been heard to tell police that he had aimed at what he thought were 'hippos and monkeys'. A group of opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) supporters staged a protest about the granting of bail outside the court, according to the party's posts on Twitter. Hendrik was freed on 1,000 rand ($62) bail and the case was postponed for further investigations to 18 May. In a country where firearms are common, fatal accidents occur often, with about 250 people killed in 2018. According to 2019-2020 police crime statistics, more than 7,000 murders with guns were reported in South Africa. In a similar incident five years ago, a South African farmer was accused of wounding a farm worker with a pellet gun after 'mistaking him for a monkey'.

In 2020, Nellie Sullivan, in her early 90s, disappeared without a trace, prompting authorities to launch an investigation without avail. However, on 14 April , a pet duck ran under a trailer in Candler, North Carolina. Its owners then discovered a container with Sullivan's remains underneath the trailer. According to Buncombe county sheriff's office, 'Apparently, the duck ran underneath the trailer at 11 Beady Eyed Lane, and as they were chasing after their pet duck, they ran across the container that Nellie Sullivan was located in.' 'If I could give that duck a medal, I would,' said Sergeant Mark Walker. The police have charged Sullivan's 46-year old granddaughter, Angela Wamsley, and her 50-year old grandson-in-law, Mark Alan Barnes, with first degree murder. The pair have been under investigation since December 2020 and were initially charged with animal cruelty and drug possession. However, a year later, Wamsley and Barnes were both charged with concealing a death, according to police. Authorities believe the pair had killed Sullivan in another location before disposing of her body underneath the trailer. Wamsley and Barnes were collecting Sullivan's cheques, retirement and social security benefits, as well as refilling her prescriptions, said police. The official cause of death of Sullivan has yet to be determined by the medical examiner, Sky News reports. Sullivan would have been 93 years old today.

Accelerating climate change is causing a 'profound' impact upon ocean ecosystems that is 'driving extinction risk higher and marine biological richness lower than has been seen in Earth's history for the past tens of millions of years', according to the study. The world's seawater is steadily climbing in temperature due to the extra heat produced from the burning of fossil fuels, while oxygen levels in the ocean are plunging and the water is acidifying from the soaking up of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This means the oceans are overheated, increasingly gasping for breath - the volume of ocean waters completely depleted of oxygen has quadrupled since the 1960s - and becoming more hostile to life. Aquatic creatures such as clams, mussels and shrimp are unable to properly form shells due to the acidification of seawater. All of this means the planet could slip into a 'mass extinction rivaling those in Earth's past', states the new research, published in Science. The pressures of rising heat and loss of oxygen are, researchers said, uncomfortably reminiscent of the mass extinction event that occurred at the end of the Permian period about 250m years ago. This cataclysm, known as the 'great dying', led to the demise of up to 96% of the planet's marine animals. 'Even if the magnitude of species loss is not the same level as this, the mechanism of the species loss would be the same,' said Justin Penn, a climate scientist at Princeton University who co-authored the new research. 'The future of life in the oceans rests strongly on what we decide to do with greenhouse gases today. There are two vastly different oceans we could be seeing, one devoid of a lot of life we see today, depending on what we see with CO2 emissions moving forward.' Truly catastrophic extinction levels may be reached should the world emit planet-heating gases in an unrestrained way, leading to more than 4C of average warming above pre-industrial times by the end of this century, the research found. This would trigger extinctions that would reshape ocean life for several more centuries as temperatures continue to climb. But even in the better case scenarios, the world is still set to lose a significant chunk of its marine life. At 2C of heating above the pre-industrial norm, which is forecast as likely even under current climate pledges by the world's governments, around 4% of the roughly two million species in the oceans will be wiped out. Fish and marine mammals that live in polar regions are most vulnerable, according to the study, as they will be unable to migrate to suitably cooler climes, unlike tropical species. 'They will just have nowhere to go,' said Penn. The threat of climate change is amplifying the other major dangers faced by aquatic life, such as over-fishing and pollution. Between 10% and 15% of marine species are already at risk of extinction because of these various threats, the study found, drawing upon International Union for Conservation of Nature data. John Bruno, a marine ecologist at the University of North Carolina who was not involved in the study, said the new research appeared 'sound' but it differed from previous studies on the topic that suggest species will mainly disperse to new areas rather than be completely snuffed out. 'It's very different from what most prior work has developed. But that doesn't mean they are wrong,' Bruno said. 'I think this new work is challenging some of our current assumptions about the geographic patterns of looming extinction in the ocean.' Bruno said that while mass extinctions are likely from extreme heating in the future, the current impacts from climate change and other threats should be concerning enough for policymakers and the public. 'Personally, I'm a lot more worried about the ecosystem degradation we're already seeing after less than 1C of warming,' he said. 'We don't need to look to a world so warmed over humanity has been wiped out - we're already losing untold biodiversity and ecosystem functioning with even the relatively modest warming of the last 50 years.'", "2d40e277817a69120ab32c6c5615911af287b65479686e47458165cb": "A woman has described how her 17-year-old black British son was found at an immigration detention centre after going missing while being treated for psychosis. The boy - who is non-verbal - disappeared from a hospital in Kent, where he had been sectioned under the Mental Health Act, on 7 April. Two days later, he was arrested by British Transport Police (BTP) at Euston on suspicion of fare evasion, before being detained by Immigration Enforcement near Gatwick, despite being British. 'It's just horrific,' the boy's mother said. 'Because he's black they just assumed 'let's pick him and put him in a deportation centre'.' When the boy was returned to the hospital, his clothes contained Home Office documents that incorrectly stated his name and date of birth, and recorded his nationality as Nigerian. 'How do they know he's from Nigeria, when he doesn't even speak to them?' the woman said of her son.  When the hospital became aware of his disappearance, the family, local police and BTP were notified, the woman said, and he was listed as a missing person.  It is unclear where the boy went in the days before his arrest. He is understood to have travelled to Manchester, where the family had previously lived, before trying to return to London without a phone, money or identification. On the morning of 9 April, BTP said they were notified of a fare evader on board a London-bound train from Manchester. In a statement, BTP said the male provided a false name and date of birth, stating he was 20. At Euston, he was arrested on suspicion of fare evasion and taken to police custody in Islington, according to BTP, where 'officers were unable to engage with the male or verify the details provided despite their efforts, which included attending the address provided'. The boy's fingerprints were then taken and he was detained by Immigration Enforcement. Documents apparently prepared at the detention centre, and seen by the Guardian, incorrectly state his name and date of birth, and record his nationality as Nigerian. They describe him as a person who requires leave to enter or remain in the country, which he does not have. On one document, it states his removal from the UK was 'imminent' as he had failed to give 'satisfactory or reliable answers' to immigration officers. The boy is a British citizen and has never left the UK. His mother said he would not have been able to say his date of birth properly, and would never have said he was from Nigeria. This week, a BTP commander told her that when they searched the Kent address the boy had provided, they discovered a Nigerian family living there. She was told that officers gathered the boy was from a Nigerian background as he had the same accent as the residents. She contested this statement, describing her son's accent, when he does rarely speak, as Mancunian and London. James Wilson, deputy director of Detention Action, which works with people facing removal, said unaccompanied minors or children under the age of 18 should not be in detention in the first place. 'In theory detention should be an absolute last resort, rather than an early step you would go to,' he said. A Home Office spokesperson said: 'We rely on information provided by our policing partners when an individual is referred to Immigration Enforcement. In this case, the individual declared himself to British Transport Police to be an adult male. Police nurses assessed him and raised no physical or mental health issues.' The spokesperson said the individual gave no further information to Immigration Enforcement, and once his true identity had been established, he was returned into the care of mental health services. BTP said they were reviewing the incident internally.", "a68a1fb5979fbef497050697c8d5faf49165ab025353608af3d3eee9": "The EU's border agency has been involved in the pushbacks of at least 957 asylum seekers in the Aegean Sea between March 2020 and September 2021, according to a new investigation. Frontex, the EU's best-funded agency with a budget of EUR758m, is being investigated over previous allegations of complicity with Greek authorities in illegal pushbacks of asylum seekers, something the organisation has denied. Now a joint investigation by Lighthouse Reports, Der Spiegel, SRF Rundschau, Republik and Le Monde has revealed Frontex's involvement in what appear to be pushbacks, according to its own database. According to the joint investigation, a freedom of information request (FoI) found the agency's internal incident report database, called Jora, recorded sightings of asylum seeker pushbacks in the Aegean being labelled by officials as 'prevention of departure'. The Frontex guidelines define this as an incident when migrants are stopped at sea by non-European country authorities in their territorial waters and sent back to their point of departure. Frontex provided a redacted version of the database but included descriptions of 145 cases labelled 'prevention of departure', which differed from reports of the same incidents by the Turkish coastguard, witnesses, leaked documents and other confidential sources, when cross-referenced. In at least 22 incidents, asylum seekers were taken off dinghies, put into Greek life rafts and left adrift at sea. On 28 May last year, a group of almost 50 asylum seekers who had already landed on the Greek island of Lesbos contacted the Norwegian NGO, Aegean Boat Report, sending photos and a WhatsApp message showing their location near the island's capital, Mytilene. Hours later, some of the group were found by the Turkish coastguard at sea in orange life rafts. This case was later recorded in the Frontex database as a 'prevention of departure'. Two Frontex sources claimed to reporters that illegal pushbacks in the Aegean end up in the Jora database as 'prevention of departure'. 'Why don't they just call it 'pushbacks' and get it over with?' said a Greek coastguard officer. Human rights groups have called pushbacks in the Aegean 'systematic'. The fresh allegations against Frontex come before a 15 May referendum in Switzerland on the country's involvement with the EU border agency. In 2021, Switzerland donated 24m Swiss francs (CHF) to the agency and the government plans to increase this donation to 61m Swiss francs by 2027. But opponents of the agency's expansion say it would make Switzerland directly responsible for human rights violations taking place on Europe's borders. The referendum was called after a petition collected more than 62,000 signatures in support of cutting funding for the agency. Greece and Frontex deny allegations of pushbacks and say their officials comply with human rights legislation, but there has been mounting pressure on Frontex executive director Fabrice Leggeri, and the EU has frozen part of its budget while allegations are investigated. Tineke Strik, the Dutch MEP and a member of the Frontex Scrutiny Working Group, called for a suspension of the border agency's operations in Greece. 'A fundamental change in the culture' of the EU border agency was needed, she said, including a change of leadership, because Leggeri has 'lost credibility in taking fundamental rights seriously'. '[Frontex] should suspend operations in Greece,' Strik said. 'We have so many credible reports from authorities such as the UN and the European Council, which all say that pushbacks are systematic. More needs to be done, otherwise you become part of the violations and complicit - and this is the problem that Frontex is facing.' Frontex said it had no power to investigate the actions of individual countries and that it 'ensures and promotes the respect of fundamental rights in all its border management activities'. The agency said it was 'fully committed to uphold the highest standards of border control within our operations and our officers are bound by a code of conduct. This is the standard we bring to every one of our operations.' In a statement, the agency added: 'Fundamental rights, including the respect for the principle of non-refoulement, are at the core of all the agency's activities.' Non-refoulement is the fundamental principle underpinning international refugee law: a person requiring protection cannot be forcibly returned to a place where they will face harm. It added that staff were obliged to report any violations of rights and that the agency had more than 20 monitors in place.

Leiland-James Corkill was 13 months old and in the care of Laura Castle and her husband, Scott, when he died at their home in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. The couple deny mistreating Leiland-James from 21 August 2020, the day he moved in with them, until he was taken to hospital with head injuries on 6 January 2021. He died the next day. A jury at Preston crown court were read text messages between the couple, apparently regretting the adoption a month after his arrival. 'He's an absolute moaning winge bag and I totally regret doin this. I'm goin to lose my mind,' Laura, 38, messaged Scott, on 23 September. She added: 'I need to stop smacking him cos if I start I'll not stop at one point and it's not getting us anywhere and then I feel bad.' Scott, 34, replied to call the 13-month old 'a dick baby'. Scott, who worked at BAE Systems in Barrow, denies causing or allowing Leiland-James's death. Laura has pleaded guilty to manslaughter but denies murder. She said the little boy fell from the sofa. But a pathologist concluded that Leiland-James had suffered a non-accidental, traumatic head injury, which could have occurred by someone shaking him forcefully. Opening the case on Thursday, the prosecution barrister, Michael Brady, QC, said Leiland-James was a 'robust and resilient child' who had been taken into care at his birth on 21 December 2019. He initially lived with foster carers until the Castles were approved as potential adopters, with Leiland-James formally 'handed over' to the couple on 22 August for a trial period. Laura subsequently told a social worker that she did not love Leiland-James, the jury heard. She said she was struggling to bond with him and that she and her husband felt as though they were 'babysitting' him. But unbeknown to social services, the court heard, she was assaulting the little boy within five weeks of his arrival. 'I've just absolutely leathered him, I can['t] take this any more, he's gonna have to go,' Laura told Scott in a text on 24 September. Scott replied to say: 'Your not an abusive parent baby. Not at all. Don't say that. I think he's a little too fucked up for us to handle xc. 'Let's just call it quits. I don't want you to have a mental break down. Your more important to me than him.' A month before Leiland-James died, Cumbria county council's adoption panel agreed not to recommend an adoption 'given the issues with attachment', Brady told the court. The couple were told they would not be able permanently to adopt Leiland-James 'until further therapeutic work had been done'. The night before Leiland-James died, Scott sent a text to Laura suggesting the little boy might benefit from 'a good hard smack'. Brady told the jury: 'It is the crown's case that set against a background of frustration, born out of highly stressful domestic circumstances, including financial difficulties and an inability to bond with Leiland-James, Laura Castle's frustration with Leiland-James turned to hostility, as evidenced by her physical abuse of him culminating in his murder.' The case continues.", "59868462931e6b13ab9ee1f0078db037f75f64d24bab4193778b89f3": "When Downing Street was recently named as the suspected victim of a phone hack by the United Arab Emirates using the Israeli-made spyware, Pegasus, few were surprised at who was behind the discovery. The Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto has for years been a thorn in the side of the NSO Group, deciphering the company's sophisticated hacking tools and - crucially - identifying victims of the spyware. Ron Deibert, the longtime director of the Canadian research group, is one of the world's leading experts on identifying digital threats against civil society. John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab, is among a relatively small group of experts globally who can identify which iPhones and Android devices have been infected with Pegasus, and which government clients are likely to have been responsible. It is unsurprising, then, that the pair were an intense focus at Novalpina, the London-based private equity group which took over NSO Group in 2019, and quickly sought to stem its reputation for enabling repressive governments to commit widespread human rights abuses. Using UK data protection laws, Deibert and Scott-Railton last year sought the personal data held on them by Novalpina. The results of their so-called subject access requests, recently shared with the Guardian, contain snippets of hundreds of emails and attachments that included their names. The released data, combined with information from other sources, sheds light on an apparent attempt by Novalpina partner Stephen Peel to gather information on and undermine Citizen Lab. In one case, he even reached out to George Soros, whose foundation is an important Citizen Lab donor, and complained about the researchers. Peel, a former British Olympic rower, was the architect of a drive to 'establish a new benchmark for transparency and respect for human rights' when Novalpina acquired NSO in early 2019. Citizen Lab, meanwhile, had since 2016 been at the forefront of exposing the human rights abuses perpetrated by NSO Group's customers, revealing, for example, how Saudi Arabia had used the company's spyware to hack the mobile phone of a dissident who was a close associate of Jamal Khashoggi months before the journalist was murdered. Novalpina's lawyers said in letters released to Deibert and Scott-Railton that they found 473 emails that contained Deibert's personal data, which included some duplicates. 223 emails named Scott-Railton. They reveal how in February 2019, Novalpina and NSO retained the services of Vivek Krishnamurthy, who at the time was a lawyer with expertise in corporate social responsibility practice at the American law firm Foley Hoag. A source familiar with the matter said NSO paid the firm about $220,000 (PS170,000) for its work. Krishnamurthy was recruited as a 'specialist external adviser' to align NSO's governance framework with the UN's guiding principles on business and human rights (UNGP). However, the documents suggest there may have been another motive as well: Krishnamurthy was an alumnus of the University of Toronto, and years earlier had worked as a research assistant for Deibert, who had helped him secure a Rhodes scholarship. As a result, he was well-placed to try to cosy up to the NSO critic. A February 2019 proposal by Foley Hoag to provide legal services to NSO said Krishnamurthy's prior relationship with Deibert meant he was in a 'unique position to conduct outreach to Citizen Lab should the NSO Group find it desirable to do so'. The proposal acknowledged that NSO had 'reputational challenges' and said: 'Our goal is to help the NSO Group become seen as the world's most ethical company in the surveillance space by establishing systems, policies, and procedures to ensure that it operates in a rights-respecting manner.' In a 1 March 2019 exchange, Peel emailed Krishnamurthy telling the lawyer it was time to 'reach out to Deibert to find out what is going on'. The lawyer promptly replied that he would, adding: 'He can be prickly, and he's clearly worked up about NSO.' The following day, Krishnamurthy sent an email to his former mentor, explaining he had been hired to work on NSO's human rights policies. He told Deibert he had 'thought long and hard' about whether to work for NSO, especially in light of Citizen Lab's recent work. 'I would probably have said no were it not for my good friend Sir Mark Stephens,' he wrote, referring to the British lawyer - who is a CBE but not a knight - as 'one of the world's foremost human rights lawyers'. He said Stephens, a celebrated British lawyer who frequently acts in high-profile cases, with former clients including Julian Assange, Salman Rushdie, and Greenpeace, had assured him of Peel's 'deep personal commitment to human rights, and of his desire to see NSO operate in a rights-respecting manner'. Deibert declined the meeting. He told the Guardian he did not believe NSO Group or its owners had shown good faith in responses to Citizen Lab's correspondence and questions, and did not wish to appear to legitimise the company. He also turned down an attempt three months later by Krishnamurthy to secure a face-to-face meeting with his old university mentor when - following an exchange with Peel informing him he would again seek out a meeting with Deibert - Krishnamurthy told Deibert by email that he wanted to see him while on family trip to Toronto: 'You'd be having a drink with me in my capacity as your former student, and not as anything else!' Deibert said he found it 'deeply troubling and disappointing' that Novalpina had employed a former student and research assistant seemingly to 'surreptitiously weasel their way into gathering information on our activities'. Krishnamurthy, a faculty member at the University of Ottawa who was recently appointed to a Canadian government advisory committee on online safety, denied he was hired for that reason, but conceded that his prior relationship with Deibert was relevant for the work he could do for Novalpina 'as a good faith broker' with the NGO community. He expressed 'regret' that his work for NSO's financial backers damaged his relationship with Deibert, describing his work for for the company as 'the weirdest matter I've ever handled'. Stephens, who described Peel as a friend, confirmed that he suggested Krishnamurthy to the Novalpina executive, but he said he was unaware at the time of Krishnamurthy's prior relationship with Deibert. He said he had previously worked for Peel, but not for Novalpina or NSO. Stephens praised Peel and criticised Citizen Lab for disproportionately focusing on NSO. 'The practical result of what they [Citizen Lab] have done is to ignore and effectively divert attention from the other players in this marketplace and they have given them a completely free pass and I think that's reprehensible,' Stephens said. Citizen Lab has, in fact, produced reports on a range of other cyber surveillance companies, and published reports on other digital threats to civil society, including Chinese government censorship and vulnerabilities in Covid-related applications. Its work has attracted funding from the Ford Foundation, Hewlett Foundation, and the Open Society Foundations, which was created by the billionaire philanthropist George Soros. The Novalpina documents released to Deibert include one email from Soros's office that was forwarded by Peel to NSO in Israel. The document was redacted, but well-placed sources and other emails seen by the Guardian suggest the outreach to Soros may have been part of an ultimately unsuccessful attempt by Peel to undermine Citizen Lab's funding. In May 2019, Peel is understood to have raised Citizen Lab at a dinner with Soros in New York. He later followed up with emails in which he sought to discredit the Canadian research group. In one, he lambasted Citizen Lab's research, claiming it was 'an organisation unknown except for its attack on NSO'. He questioned the group's motivations, tactics, and objectives, which he described as 'a little less pure than we might of hoped'. One person familiar with the matter said they believed Peel's unspoken aim could have been to get Soros to withhold his charity's financial support for the researchers. A second well-placed source said they could not judge Peel's motive, but they could not rule out that was his intention. Soros was ultimately unmoved by the criticism of Citizen Lab. A month after the dinner, the Hungarian-born billionaire advised Peel he should probably extricate himself from the NSO investment. Lawyers for Peel said these were 'tenuous and unsubstantiated allegations' and that Peel was committed to 'good governance and human rights'. Deibert said the documents suggested Novalpina's commitment to aligning NSO with human rights principles seemed to be a figleaf. 'We have seen enough of their obviously absurd denials in the face of evidence of abuse to understand they do not appear genuinely interested in human rights due diligence as much as making money and crafting a seemingly palatable public-facing image,' he said. 'One can only conclude that the bottom line matters more than human rights for those lining their pockets from NSO Group's sales - including, their executives, owners, and high-priced lawyers.' Krishnamurthy said in a written statement to the Guardian that he and his colleagues had believed when they were retained that Novalpina was serious about making 'real changes at NSO'. 'However, the NSO Group's subsequent record of complicity in gross human rights violations shows how wrong we were. I regret my brief time advising Novalpina in 2019,' he said. Krishnamurthy added that he hoped leaders like Deibert and Citizen Lab would 'succeed in bringing NSO's extremely harmful activities to an end'. A US consultancy called Berkeley Research Group (BRG) took over management of the fund that owns NSO last July after an internal dispute between the founding partners of Novalpina.", "ab432685a9ccf7053efcac48b9224d971bdb3d56b01e5c3347505874": "The Biden administration is to propose legislation that would allow US federal and state agencies to 'go after' oil companies on wholesale and retail sales practices, lambasting the industry over price gouging and profiteering. As American voters express increasing concerns about the high prices of a wide range of consumer goods, including energy and food, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said passing legislation to bring down retail gasoline prices 'is at the very top of our list'. Neither Schumer nor House speaker Nancy Pelosi would say when such legislation will be voted upon, or how much money it could end up saving consumers if enacted into law. 'Big oil has profiteered and exploited the marketplace,' Pelosi told reporters, noting companies' strong corporate profits over the past year. 'They are hoarding the windfall while keeping prices high at the pump,' she added. The move comes as gas prices have surged in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Despite recent falls, the average price of a gallon of gas is now over $4 in the US, up from $2.88 a year ago, according to the American Automobile Association. Oil companies have enjoyed record profits as prices have soared. Exxon, the largest US oil company, is expected to report record earnings on Friday and rival Chevron recently reported 'the best two quarters the company has ever seen'. Pelosi said the White House had discussed a 'holiday' for Federal gas taxes but said that there was no evidence that oil companies would pass those savings on to consumers. Oil companies are not alone in reporting huge surges in profits even as consumers face higher bills thanks to soaring inflation. An analysis of 100 leading US companies found their net profits had risen by a median of 49%, and in one case by as much as 111,000%. The increases came even as prices rose and average wage increases were eroded by rising inflation.

It stood in the middle of a traffic island, near a bin, a lamp-post and a bollard. I never questioned the presence of the phone box, just as I never questioned the presence of the bin, the lamp-post or the bollard. Often, when we passed, my daughter and I would play the phone-box game. I had to stand to one side and pretend to call the phone in the phone box, which didn't work. She would then pretend to answer, before making a series of further calls in a complicated unfolding of phone-related business that involved making plans, changing plans and then ringing everyone she had just spoken to again to tell them she was going to be late. It was fun, this game, and it became hard to pass the phone box without playing it. The phone box, to her, was the best kind of toy. It was a real object that no longer worked, and therefore had the gravitas of something adults had once used, but could now be deployed to her own imaginative ends. It also had an extra, loopy charm. A giant phone housed in its own little shelter outside in the middle of the street made absolutely no sense. A phone, to her, was a small, shiny rectangle that lived in my coat pocket. This outdoor cubicle with a handset on a cord and fat, squishy buttons was both hilarious and mysterious, as if it had landed from the sky. Walk round a city, a town, a village and you see them. The last phone boxes. Once you start seeing them, you see them everywhere. For a while, I became preoccupied by their contradictory presence, often standing proudly on a street corner, completely ignored. At their peak, in the mid-1990s, the British population of phone boxes was about 100,000. Now, there are just over 20,000 working boxes left, which still sounds like quite a lot, given it's hard to imagine anyone actually using one. And yet, they do. According to Ofcom, 5m calls are still made from phone boxes annually. Five million! It seems impossible. A number so surprisingly large it made me think there must be a lone guy in a box somewhere obsessively making one-minute calls all day to random numbers. Many of the phone boxes you still see are shells of their former selves: not working, not yet gone. Just there, a remnant of a former time, often used as a bin. Some have been repurposed. Since 2008, when BT launched its adopt-a-kiosk scheme, more than 7,000 phone boxes, mostly the old red ones, have been bought by local communities for PS1 each. Now, they house things such as mini libraries, art galleries and plant displays; many contain defibrillators, for ready access in a medical emergency. Those that remain occupy a particular place in Britain's idea of itself. On Oxford Street, I passed a tourist shop whose window display included a shelf of miniature red phone boxes sitting alongside its close relations: the doubledecker bus, the black taxi and an old-fashioned post box, all symbolic of a storybook, Enid Blyton-ish Britain. 'If you were to do a painting of an English village,' said Nigel Linge, professor of telecommunications at Salford University and probably Britain's premier phone-box expert, 'you'd have a duck pond, a church, a pub and I'd bet you'd have a phone box.' (Linge's first phone-box memory: calling relatives from the one on his estate in the mining village of Willington, County Durham; his family didn't get a phone in the house until the 1980s.) 'I don't think any other country is as passionate about their phone boxes as we are about ours,' he added. To understand this unlikely passion, I started going into every phone box I passed. Typically, there was broken glass, discarded cider cans, an unmistakable smell of piss. Not much to love. One old red box in Camden was a wreck - no door, plastic bottles and browned leaves carpeting the floor, a handwritten note in the glass advertising a hot blonde. I picked up the receiver and heard, unbelievably, the long tone of a line open for calls. An old, old sound. And then, a memory dump from a mid-1990s adolescence. Back then, out with friends, I used phone boxes quite a lot. They were near bus stops, outside tube stations. The odd reverse-charge call in a mishap, begging lifts or forgiveness. Now, the phone box is an object caught between existence and obsolescence. They seem pointless, and yet they endure, on our streets and in our culture, covered in creepers in the music video for Adele's song Hello; clambered all over by One Direction for the cover of their 2012 album Take Me Home; being stroked by Molly-Mae Hague, in beige shorts and waistcoat, for a recent Pretty Little Thing campaign. ('A lot of youngsters seem to want to be photographed near one,' noted Linge.) Thousands of people apparently still use them. I wanted to know who they were and why, when technology had long ago surpassed what a phone box could offer, they were still heaving open their weirdly heavy doors and making a call. People, remembering them in their prime, often talk about the smell. Cigarettes and cleaning fluid. A metallic odour on your fingers from the buttons. Once, there were phone directories on a shelf, then sex-worker cards wallpapering the door. In the early days, until the last manual switchboard closed in 1976, you spoke to an operator and told her - it was always her - what number you wanted to call. Often, there were queues. 'You'd have to walk round the corner shop and wait your turn,' said Martin White, owner of a company, X2 Connect, which repairs and resells old phone boxes that BT has removed. I visited White at his offices on an industrial estate in Newark, Nottinghamshire. His business has an inevitable limit, given the dwindling numbers of boxes. 'Another thousand or so will do,' White told me. 'Then that will be the end of that.' Surely White would know who was making all those calls. But no. He'd last used one 'six years ago?' His kids, aged 38 and 36, had never been inside one, as far as he knew. To one side of White's office was an open space that had been turned into a kind of phone-box purgatory, crammed with battered boxes awaiting their new life. Once refurbished, White sells them on to all sorts. Old people's homes to jog the memory of residents; private clients who fancy a bit of heritage in the garden; nostalgics embarking on a quest, like the old man who wanted to buy the box from which he'd called his wife when they were teenagers. They get plenty of overseas buyers, too, who want their own bit of British kitsch. White had recently shipped one off to a shopping mall in Dubai. In their weathered state, you could just about pick out a potted history of the British phone box. White didn't have the earliest standard model, the cream K1 (Kiosk One), which appeared in 1921, after the General Post Office had taken over the operation of phone boxes in 1912. (The link was logical: the Post Office and phone boxes were both a public good in the business of connecting people.) But there were plenty of the most common of the old red boxes, the K6, designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and introduced in 1935, in celebration of King George V's Silver Jubilee. (It was embossed with the Tudor crown.) And there were more than anyone could hope for of the unlovable 1980s version, dull grey and black with a boxy, flat-topped shape that abandoned all of the blazing-red, domed-roof chutzpah of the earlier version. No Dubai shopping mall was coming for those. Even in their heyday, phone boxes were problematic. 'They've never made money,' said Linge. The boxes - free to enter and full of cash - were like invitations to vandalism. But they were always heavily used. When BT became independent of the Post Office in 1981, and was then privatised in 1984, the company kept increasing the population of boxes until the 1990s. It was only when mobiles became ubiquitous in the early 2000s that BT began culling their numbers. The boxes, many now unused, were a cost whatever their state: the working ones needed maintenance, the broken ones required removal. In the year to April 2020, the company's net loss on its provision was PS4.5m. But even if it wanted to, BT can't just scrap them all. The company is under a 'universal service obligation' to provide phone boxes, regulated by Ofcom, which, as its director of connectivity Selina Chadha told me, has to ensure that 'everyone in the country can communicate'. BT can only remove a phone box if it has the approval of Ofcom and the local authority, and the box isn't in a location with no mobile signal, where there are frequent traffic accidents, if more than 52 calls have been made from the box in the past year, or if there are 'exceptional circumstances' such as the phone box being frequently used to call helplines. BT is therefore left in a bind, required to maintain thousands of phone boxes that dent its profits. James Browne, BT's 'head of street', assured me that it 'takes its responsibility to provide street-based telephony very seriously' and as such, the company has come up with a new ruse, the Street Hub 2.0 - a tall, flat screen wedged into the pavement offering rolling advertising space and, if you look closely enough, free wifi and calling facilities. (A small percentage of the ad space is given freely to councils and local businesses.) 'Yes, it's a commercial endeavour,' said Browne, cheerfully. Redundant as they seem, there are times when phone boxes prove essential. After Storm Arwen last November, which left thousands of people in the north of England and Scotland without power and mobile service, Chadha told me she had received reports from communities wishing they still had their phone box. According to Ofcom, from May 2019 to May 2020, 150,000 calls were made from phone boxes to emergency services. And then there are the other emergencies: the 25,000 phone box calls made to ChildLine that year; the 20,000 calls to Samaritans. Calls made by people who can't make them at home or on a mobile, for reasons too private or painful to know. The phone box in Seathwaite, in the valley of Borrowdale in the Lake District, is probably the most remote in England. It sits at the edge of a farmyard, next to a path that leads to Scafell, the country's highest mountain. Last August, a man made a 999 call from the box after his 13-year-old son fell and injured his leg on their way to the 140ft waterfall at Taylor Gill Force. The boy couldn't walk. The emergency operator alerted the Keswick mountain rescue team, who sent out nine volunteers to stretcher him off the mountain. Recently, when I stopped to pay my respects to the box that had so recently been of active service - one of the 5m calls! - I picked up the phone and heard the reassuring hum of the dial tone, surely a beautiful sound if you've just stumbled down a path leaving your child up there in pain. According to Freda Chapman, who has lived in Borrowdale all her life, BT had been trying to remove the area's four phone boxes for years. 'Each time we get consulted, and each time we have objected to their removal,' she told me. In one consultation in 2016, BT revealed that 378 calls had been made from the Seathwaite box in a year. 'Only one a day,' conceded Freda, 'but that is still one a day.' BT also suggested the Borrowdale villages - Rosthwaite, Seathwaite, Seatoller and Stonethwaite - adopt their phone boxes for community use, flowers or books, which as Chapman put it, 'is a nice thing to do if you don't need the phone box any more. But we said we'd rather have the phone box, actually.' Borrowdale's phone boxes vary. Rosthwaite's is the 1980s version, as is Seathwaite's, while the ones in Seatoller and Stonethwaite are the classic reds, objects whose decorative crowns and distinctive shape, modelled on Sir John Soane's family vault in St Pancras churchyard, are located in such arresting settings, backed by dry stone walls and rising dark hills, that any photograph of them looks like the kind of stock shot you find in a picture frame. Pretty as the villages might be, up there on the mountains, conditions can be rough. Walkers fall all the time. The Keswick mountain rescue team performed 126 rescues last year. Rob Grange, one of the team, told me that even if you're able to scramble down for help, half of the few cottages in the valley are holiday rentals and dark for most of the year. 'You come down off the fell,' said Grange, with a faraway look that suggested sleet and adversity, 'and there's nobody there.' When BT issued its 2016 consultation about the Seathwaite phone box, the Keswick team posted the news on Facebook and overnight prompted hundreds of complaints to Allerdale borough council. The Seathwaite box was saved, but in plenty of other villages in the Lakes there were boxes with blue BT posters tacked up next to the phone warning that the company was planning to remove it. In Chapel Stile, all that was left was a freshly tarmacked square where it had once stood, like an unmarked grave. Three hundred miles south of the Lakes, on a parade of shops in North Wembley, resides the Borrowdale quartet's perfect opposite: four unused and unloved boxes. 'Not the pretty red ones,' said local councillor Mary Daly, regretfully. Three of them are the 1980s boxes, each in varying states of disrepair. One is more contemporary, installed about five years ago, and the only one that works. 'I've never seen anyone use it,' said Katherine Cunneen, a local resident. 'Never.' As hard as the residents of Borrowdale campaign to keep their phone boxes, Cunneen is fighting to have the defunct boxes taken away. Cunneen has lived in North Wembley for nearly 50 years. When she moved to the neighbourhood from a local authority flat in Paddington, 'everyone said, 'You're so lucky''. She had a house, there was a Marks & Spencer, three cinemas. Over the decades, she told me, the good shops have left, replaced by endless takeaways. Rubbish is left on the streets. The housing stock has become run down. The phone boxes, she felt, were symbolic of the neighbourhood's decline. On a recent grey afternoon, she took me from one grotty specimen to another, the kind of boxes where no one wants to start a community library or pose in beige shorts. One had what looked like green algae spreading up its walls; another seemed to have been whitewashed on the inside, as if to obscure criminal activity taking place within, or just its regular use as a toilet. 'Would you see these in Richmond?' said Cunneen, pointing at a particularly bleak kiosk by the tube station. That one, she said, was mostly used by people straight off the train: she had seen a man walk out of it just the other day, zipping up his fly.  Phone boxes have always been an obvious location for a variety of crimes, being both easily accessible and oddly private. There was a stabbing in one in Bolton in February. In Littlehampton a few years ago, a sex offender used to regularly call a phone box to target passing schoolchildren. In Nottingham, some boxes outside the Bridgeway shopping centre had to be removed after it was reported in 2018 that more than 3,000 calls were being made from them a year, mostly by drug dealers. (At the time, a BT spokesman valiantly suggested the source of all the calls 'could well be tourists', but as a local resident countered, 'I don't think we tend to see an awful lot of tourists in the Bridgeway Centre to be quite honest.') In North Wembley, Cunneen took up the situation with her local councillor, Daly, who tried to raise the issue at the council, and convince BT to take them away. But there they remain. Ultimately, it was BT's choice to remove them or not. 'I don't accept that,' said Cunneen. 'They're on the pavement. They might own the structure, but they don't own the pavement.' Britain's most attractive phone boxes, meanwhile, have become such beloved and valuable commodities that they now get stolen. Last summer, there were reports of phone box theft from the villages of Chelford in Cheshire and Holtwood in Dorset. 'I drove past one day, and it had gone,' said Josh Pritchard, the manager of Holtwood Farm, a day centre for adults with learning difficulties. No one in the village could make sense of it. The box, next to the Methodist church, was about to be taken over by Pritchard's farm and turned into a mini library. It's not easy to steal a phone box. They have power cables that run into the ground and are locked in place on a concrete base. A thief would need a lorry-mounted crane to yank it out of the earth and drive it away. They must have come at night, said Celia Moore, chair of Holt parish council, who sounded both mystified and mournful at the loss. 'It was just always there,' she said. 'It's a bit disappointing for the community,' added Pritchard. 'There's a church, a post box and a phone box. That was it.' That painting of the village, now missing its most colourful feature. The parish council informed the police, who didn't seem particularly moved by their case. Phone-box theft is not an urgent crime. Still, the villagers wondered why someone would bother. 'Obviously there's a market out there for them,' said Pritchard, 'so someone decided to make a few quid.' The phone box market has several dimensions. There is the BT-approved market in the form of companies that sell them on, and the eBay market where you can buy a box with mysterious provenance for PS3,000, and then there's another kind of market in the form of a company called RKC Estates, run by Eddie Ottewell, who around a decade ago bought a load of old red boxes from BT for PS1 each through a charitable venture called Thinking Outside The Box, and then appeared to change tack and started auctioning business leases for the boxes online. (Ottewell did not respond to a request for an interview.) According to Mat Harris, who knows Ottewell and runs the site that auctions his boxes, Ottewell bought up listed boxes in good locations - Brighton, Greenwich, Hampton Court, Hampstead - where his clients knew that their business selling coffee or sandwiches, or whatever else they could flog from a tiny box, would have plenty of passing traffic. In Hampstead alone, Harris estimated RKC Estates owned five or six boxes, which, according to RKC's website, are rented out for PS400 a month after an initial fee of somewhere between PS1,500 and PS4,200. A couple of well-positioned boxes near Brighton pier were put up for sale for PS10,000 each. The one in Greenwich, meanwhile, Ottewell was apparently keen to hold on to, 'unless he gets a really silly price'. 'His 100 quid investment is worth PS1m now,' added Harris, confirming the final stage of the phone box's peculiar arc, from public service via privatised anachronism through patriotic iconography to profit-making commodity. All that from a box. But the question still burned. Who, who, was making all those calls? I spent so long lurking suspiciously around phone boxes, hoping, always hoping, that I might catch someone in the act. In the end, the only call I witnessed was the one I made myself, to the payphones hotline - a small team in a call centre in Wales - to report on the decrepit state of the Camden phone box in which I was standing. The only time I even saw someone else step inside one was when I happened to spot some engineers working at an electrical cabinet next to a box. One went in, lifted the phone and shouted in amazement: 'It works!' I'd listened to plenty of nostalgic stories, though. Like Martin White, ringing his future wife. Or Freda Chapman's mother, whose only way of getting a message to her husband while he was at work was by popping down to the village box. Or Andrew Hurley, the phone-box curator whose mother would go to the local kiosk every Sunday night at 8pm to talk to his father while he was fighting in the second world war. The most devoted phone-box user I heard about, however, was Eric Dewhurst of Bretherton, Lancashire. Dewhurst lived alone, opposite an old red box which he used as his personal phone. Most days, he'd take his bag of 20ps across the road and install himself for his daily calls, often to his older brother, Bill, or to his nieces, Carole and Elaine. They once bought him a mobile phone, but he refused to touch it. 'He didn't like change,' Elaine told me. (They tried to give him a duvet once, but he preferred to stick with having 'hundreds of blankets' on his bed.) If it was wet and cold, Dewhurst would be in there wearing boots and several coats, including a mackintosh tied up with twine. People would call him in the box, too. Everyone in the village knew it as Eric's phone, so if someone passing heard it ring, they'd answer, then pop across the road to his bungalow and tell him he was wanted. When Dewhurst died in 2019, the phone box in Bretherton stopped being used - it was a one-man box - but the village decided to fill it with books and keep it in his memory. His name won't mean much to a newcomer, but any Bretherton longtimer can picture Eric out there in all weathers, bulky in his coats, a bag of silver in one hand, chatting. I wondered what Eric would have made of the new Street Hub 2.0. No shelter from the rain in one of those. You can't get in it at all. I found a few newly installed around the corner from the old Camden box, all giving off a low hum from an internal fan. Close up, I realised they simply resembled giant smartphones - a black rectangle with a massive screen, with a keypad and ports for your charger and headphones. It was hard to imagine someone standing there, all plugged in, casually ringing a mate. But then I remembered the father in the Seathwaite box, all those emergency services calls, the calls to ChildLine and Samaritans, the people after Storm Arwen who wished they still had their phone box, all the other Eric Dewhursts who must be out there, living alone, suspicious of mobiles. As Selina Chadha put it, 'Some payphones are a lifeline.' When all else has failed, a rope thrown into the water connects one troubled hand to another. A cable from a phone box links voice to voice. Human connection can be an act of rescue in itself. I started to think that Ofcom, in its touching insistence that a private company continues to provide the population of a country the chance to make a call from a box on the street, was on to something. As we look at a future where storms descend with greater frequency, where energy sources are compromised or unaffordable, where power is no longer something we can assume we will always have in our homes - perhaps Ofcom knew just how essential phone boxes may still be. At the end of my wayward quest, I decided that if I couldn't see someone make a call from a phone box, I could at least hear one ring. They must have rung so often, once. All those queues; a time slot long arranged for a parent to call a child who'd moved to the city; lovers waiting to hear each other's voices. I texted my mother. Call me on this number! I'm in a phone box! She didn't reply, probably busy. I waited for 10 minutes until the awkwardness of standing in a phone box doing nothing became overwhelming. I texted her again and told her not to worry - the combination of technology and communication once again proving itself to be an imperfect work in progress. To scratch the itch, I ended up ringing the phone box from my mobile, and there it was, the tinny little sound of potential connection, drifting into the street.

But on Monday I met her in person for the first time. We were meeting just days after prosecutors announced they were dropping criminal charges against her, cancelling a scheduled court appearance where she was set to find out if they would retry her case. Even so, Moses insisted that she take me to visit the hulking criminal courthouse in downtown Memphis, a building simply known by its address, 201 Poplar. We went through security and walked downstairs into one of the courthouse's main waiting areas, where electronic screens on the wall showed defendant names and where they stood on court dockets for the day. It was mostly empty, but on a normal day, Moses said, it's crowded with Black people waiting to get their cases heard. She walked past a line of people waiting at a clerk's office and asked a teller if a judge she knew was still around - he wasn't. We took the elevator up to the seventh floor, which houses the courtroom where Moses' case took place. When the doors opened, a sheriff's deputy beamed, gave her a hug, and congratulated her on beating the case. 'This man tried to kill me the first time he met me,' Moses said, laughing. She would later tell me he was one of the officers who took her into custody when the bail in her voting case was abruptly revoked in December. Now, she said, they were cool with each other. Back downstairs we ran into Kenneth Brashier, a lawyer Moses has known for a long time. He was beaming too and congratulated her. 'Usually you have a cigar when you take a victory lap,' he told her. Moses said she'd take a victory lap once she changed Tennessee's law around felon disenfranchisement. It was raining, so Moses and I spent the rest of the day driving around Memphis in her car. Waiting to pick up her son Taj from school, we talked about the case of Crystal Mason, the Texas woman appealing a five-year prison sentence for casting a provisional ballot while ineligible in 2016. Moses was stunned to learn Mason's vote wasn't even counted. She walked me through several of the criminal and other legal cases she's been involved in, rattling off an encyclopedic knowledge of judges, lawyers, and other county officials. She's outspoken and embraces her reputation as a bit of a troublemaker. 'I'm like Rocky Balboa,' she said at one point with a laugh. When I asked her what would come next for her now that the voting case was over, she didn't miss a beat. 'I'm working on getting a man of out of prison who's been there for 25 years,' she said. In her yard, she still has a sign up from her long shot 2019 mayoral campaign. It was that effort that prompted election officials to start investigating her voting eligibility. Earlier that morning, Moses had held a press conference at the National Civil Rights Museum at the Lorraine motel, where Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated. It was the first time Moses had spoken about her case since the charges were dropped. Taj, 13, a tech whiz, helped set up two iPhones to stream the press conference. 'I am so lucky to be here with my mom because I am blessed. Other children are not as fortunate as me to have their parents released and have their charges dropped,' he said. Moses said Tennessee should get rid of the form that people with felonies have to fill out if they want to vote, the document at the center of her case. Tennessee has one of the most confusing and harshest felon disenfranchisement policies in the country - more than 450,000 people, including more than 20% of the Black voting age population, can't vote because of a felony conviction, according to an estimate by the Sentencing Project. She told me she saw her case as an effort to intimidate Black voters. 'When it comes to Black people in the south, whatever we do, if it's wrong, you've got to pay for it,' she said. 'If there was a white person and I got treated the way I did, I would be just as upset, but you don't see white people getting treated like that.' Moses also rebuked Amy Weirich, the district attorney who prosecuted the case. Weirich put out a statement on Friday suggesting Moses bore responsibility for her long sentence because she did not take a plea deal. Moses said the statement showed how the prosecutor was determined to get a conviction: 'It showed who she is: arrogant, wants to be right. I think it just sounded like she wanted to win.' A Weirich spokesman declined an interview request. Moses urged people to vote in the Democratic primary for district attorney, which is going on right now (two of the candidates, Linda Harris and Janika White, watched from the audience). Afterwards, during a lunch at a barbecue restaurant across the street, Moses encouraged other Tennessee voters to talk to Harris. At the press conference that morning, she mentioned that she had considered committing suicide while she was in jail last year. Later she told me it was connected to the shock of being abruptly taken into custody. 'Going to jail is not a bad thing for somebody who's been before. It's a bad thing when you're not expecting it,' she said. Snacking on a steady stream of Jolly Ranchers from her front cupholder as we drove around that afternoon, she pointed out what she sees as deep inequalities in Memphis. Near Graceland, we drove by what looked like a busy voting precinct. People vote there, she said, because there's money and tourism. Further down the road, Moses pointed out the neighborhood had changed: many of the buildings were abandoned, a consequence, she said, of white flight. 'There's so many things wrong in Memphis,' Moses said. 'How dare you waste our tax dollars, waste our time, waste our manpower, how dare you do that? That's what most people can agree on.'", "363faadfcdf936cb8e8a4189711d5a20b0b32c5e769d1efaa6fcbac6": "On a spring morning three years ago, a new recruit to a loyalist Syrian militia was handed a laptop belonging to one of Bashar al-Assad's most feared security wings. He opened the screen and curiously clicked on a video file, a brave move given the consequences if anyone had caught him prying. The footage was unsteady at first, before it closed in on a freshly dug pit in the ground between the bullet-pocked shells of two buildings. An intelligence officer he knew was knelt near the hole's edge in military fatigues and a fishing hat, brandishing an assault rifle and barking orders. The rookie militiaman froze in horror as the scene unfolded: a blindfolded man was led by the elbow and told to run towards the giant hole that he did not know lay in front of him. Nor did he anticipate the thud of bullets into his flailing body as he tumbled on to a pile of dead men beneath him. One by one, more unsuspecting detainees followed; some were told they were running from a nearby sniper, others were mocked and abused in their last moments of life. Many seemed to believe their killers were somehow leading them to safety. When the killing was done, at least 41 men lay dead in the mass grave in the Damascus suburb of Tadamon, a battlefront at the time in the conflict between the Syrian leader and insurrectionists lined up against him. Alongside piled heaps of dirt that would soon be used to finish the job, the killers poured fuel on the remains and ignited them, laughing as they literally covered up a war crime just several miles from Syria's seat of power. The video was date-stamped 16 April 2013. A paralysing nausea took hold of the recruit, who instantly decided the footage needed to be seen elsewhere. That decision has led him, three years later, on a perilous journey from one of the darkest moments of Syria's recent history to the relative safety of Europe. It has also united him with a pair of academics who have spent years trying to get him - the prime source in an extraordinary investigation - to safety while identifying the man who directed the massacre and persuading him to admit his role. It is the story of a war crime, captured in real time, by one of the Syrian regime's most notorious enforcers, branch 227 of the country's military intelligence service that also details the painstaking efforts to turn the tables on its perpetrators - including how two researchers in Amsterdam duped one of the most infamous security officers in Syria through an online alter ego and seduced him into spilling the sinister secrets of Assad's war. Their work has cast an unprecedented light on crimes previously believed to have been widely committed by the regime at the height of the Syrian war but always denied or blamed on rebel groups and jihadists.  Nine years later, as war rages in Ukraine, a playbook of state terror on civilian populations rehearsed in Syria is being redeployed by Russian forces, as Vladimir Putin's so-called special military operation turns into a brutal occupation of parts of the east of the country. Military intelligence units there have been at the forefront of savagery, instilling fear into communities through mass detentions and killings of the type that characterised Assad's brutal attempts to claw back power. Trained by Soviet and Stasi officers in the 1960s, Syria's security agencies learned well the art of intimidation. Often, the allegiance of those snatched at checkpoints was of little consequence; fear was the regime's most lethal means to cling to power and it used every means available to instil it. In this case, the victims were not insurrectionists but civilians who were unaligned to either side and had accepted Assad's protection. Their murders were widely seen in Tadamon as a message to the whole suburb: 'Don't even consider opposing us.' In leaking the video, first to an opposition activist in France, and then to the researchers, Annsar Shahhoud and Prof Ugur Umit Ungor, from the University of Amsterdam's Holocaust and Genocide Center, the source had to overcome the fear of being caught and probably killed and the distress of potentially being cast out from his family - prominent members of Assad's Alawite sect, which holds the main levers of power in what remains of Syria. He would eventually learn that even as hundreds of people around the world worked to bring Assad to justice for war crimes, the video would end up being a standout piece of evidence in the case against the Syrian leader. But first, Annsar and Ugur needed to find the man in the fishing hat, and they turned to the only thing they believed could help: an alter ego. Annsar had been a vocal critic of Assad since the outbreak of the Syrian war. Her family were members of a community that had largely retained good relations with Assad, but the conflict and the ensuing economic collapse strained alliances and Annsar increasingly found herself determined to hold Assad to account, no matter the personal price. She moved to Beirut in 2013 and then to Amsterdam two years later, where she met Ugur in 2016. Both shared a drive to chronicle what they believed to be a genocide being committed in Syria. Piecing together the stories of survivors and their families was one way to do it. Speaking to the perpetrators themselves was another. Breaking the omerta code of the regime, however, was a task thought nearly impossible. But Annsar had a plan: she decided to turn to the internet, and find her way into the inner sanctum of the regime's security officials by pretending to be a fangirl who had fully embraced their cause. 'The problem was that the Assad regime is very difficult to study. You don't just walk into Damascus, waving your arms, saying well, 'Hey, I'm a sociologist from Amsterdam and I would like to ask some questions,'' said Ugur, in the grand dark wood drawing room of the Holocaust and Genocide Centre. 'We came to the conclusion that, actually, we need a character - and that character should be a young Alawite woman.' Annsar established that Syria's spies and military officers tended to use Facebook, and despite their secretive work lives, they tended not to make their social media settings private. She decided on an alias, 'Anna Sh', and asked a photographer friend to shoot an alluring glimpse of her face. She then turned her homepage into a glowing tribute to Assad and his family and set about trying to recruit friends. Day and night for the next two years, she scoured Facebook looking for likely suspects. When she found a taker, she told them she was a researcher studying the Syrian regime for her thesis. Eventually, she got good at it. She learned the regime mood of the time and, together with Ugur, tailored jokes and talking points that might help with an approach. Soon, Anna Sh became known among the security services as an understanding figure - and even a shoulder to cry on. 'They needed to talk to someone, they needed to share their experience,' she said. 'We shared some stories with them. We listened to all the stories, not focusing only on their crimes.' 'Some of these people got attached to Anna,' Ugur continued. 'And some of them started calling in the middle of the night.' Over the next two years, Annsar lived and breathed her new persona. At times she recoiled from who she had become - someone who had got into the minds of her prey and could at times understand them on a raw human level that eclipsed the clinical boundaries of her research. But the snap back to reality was usually sudden. Many of those she had spoken to had been active parts of a killing machine, others were willing parts of the cabal that enabled them. Her health took a toll, as did her social life and her sanity. The prize was worth it, however. If she could find the gunman in the video, she could start to bring justice to the families of those he killed. And, maybe, she could start what few others had managed in the decade-long conflict: begin a process that irrefutably linked the Syrian state to some of the war's worst atrocities. In March 2021, the breakthrough finally arrived. Anna Sh's Facebook following had by then won the confidence of more than 500 of the regime's most devoted officials. Among her trawls of their friends and photos, a distinctive moon face with a scar and facial hair stood out. He called himself Amgd Youssuf, and he looked very much like the gunman in the fishing hat that she had exhausted herself looking for. Soon afterwards, Annsar, or Anna Sh - by now it had become difficult to distinguish the two - received corroboration from a source inside Tadamon that the killer was a major in branch 227 of the Syrian military intelligence service. 'The relief was indescribable,' she said. 'Here was someone who held the key to it all. And now I needed to make him talk.' Annsar remembers well the moment she hit send on her friend request, and the excitement she felt when her prey accepted. After all this time, the bait had been set. Now she needed to reel him in. The first call was fleeting; Amjad was suspicious and ended the call quickly. But something in that initial conversation had whetted his curiosity. The hunter had become the hunted. Was it the thrill of talking to a strange woman, the need to interrogate someone who dared to approach him, or something else? Either way, when Amjad video-called three months later, Annsar pressed record, and 'Anna' answered the call. After all these years, there he was; stern at first, very much in character as a spy who controlled all his conversations and readily deployed stony silence as a weapon. He uttered few words, and when he did speak he mumbled, forcing his listener to strain to hear him. Anna Sh did all she could to disarm Amjad, grinning sheepishly, giggling and deferring to him as he peppered her with questions, all delivered on his terms. Gradually his frozen face begins to relax, and Anna won the floor. She asked him about Tadamon. And then she asked a question that changed the tone of the whole conversation: 'What it was like to go hungry, not to sleep, to fight, to kill - to fear for your parents, for your people. It's a huge responsibility - you carried a lot on your shoulders.' Amjad sat back in his chair, as if to acknowledge that somebody had finally understood his burden. From then on, he was in the interrogation seat. The conversation was no longer his. Anna had an answer for every one of his replies; building him up, putting him at ease and puffing his ego. Much like Jennifer Melfi was to Tony Soprano, she had become to him a therapist, a sounding board, a trusted woman that could get to know his mind without, it would seem, passing judgment. 'I don't deny that I was excited talking to him,' said Annsar. 'So I was smiling. Because wow, you're talking to him. But to know their stories, we need to convince them that we are just researchers. So they open up. It's not a result of one interview - it's a result of four years undercover. Gradually, I learned to dissociate myself. I created this girl who is really admiring their deeds. It's tough. After you close the laptop, you feel like it's heavy stuff, but it's needed. And I wanted to see him as a human.' Throughout the summer of last year, Annsar and her alter ego, with Ugur often sitting just off screen, tried to persuade Amjad to talk. Getting inside the head of a killer was one thing, but gathering real information about why he did and extracting admissions was another. They trawled his Facebook profile for clues, and came across a photo of a younger brother, and poems Amjad had written after his death in early 2013, three months before the Tadamon massacre. Anna kept pestering him for another call, but he remained elusive. Then late one night in June, her Facebook messenger lit up. It was Amjad. Here was her chance to nail him down. Amjad was more relaxed this time, dressed in a singlet with perhaps a drink or two on board. The floor was now his, or so he thought, and he began with small talk, trying to feel Anna out. She seized her moment and asked about his brother, and the feared killer and enforcer started to weep. Anna switched to Melfi mode as he told her he had to stay in the military despite the risk of his mother being forced to grieve another son. 'You did what you needed to do,' he said. And then came Amjad's first real admission. 'I killed a lot,' he said. 'I took revenge.' As if to recognise the gravity of the moment, Amjad shut down the conversation and ended the call. Over the next few months he was difficult to find, responding only on chats and asking when Anna was returning to Syria. Who was this woman who had gotten under his skin? When would he get the chance to interrogate her on his own turf and terms? Amjad started to play the role of the jealous boyfriend, asking who Anna was with, whether she drank and where she was. Annsar, meanwhile, was starting to feel that her alter ego had reached the limit of her powers, and that Anna Sh needed a rest, just as she did. The character had spoken to up to 200 regime officials, some of them direct perpetrators in murders, and others part of a community that had aided and abetted Assad's increasingly brutal attempts to cling on to power. They had started to speak among themselves about the mystery woman in all of their inboxes. Late last year, after Annsar had spoken to a woman who accused Amjad of assaulting her, she had had enough. All this empathising with perpetrators had started to seep into her soul. So, too, was living a character. 'Annsar also deserves to live,' she said. 'And then the question was, where is Annsar? Who is Annsar now? Lost in the research? Anna was able to pretend in life and as an Alawite, pretend for hours here in Amsterdam. And I think Anna went so far, it's not only a digital identity. Where is the original person in all of this? Where is Annsar? So I decided to execute Anna.' On a cold morning in January this year, Ugur and Annsar packed a small box with a printout of Anna's Facebook profile, a sword used as a symbol by the Assad regime and some trinkets and drove to a nature reserve outside Amsterdam. There, they dug a hole and buried the character, with a startled dog walker the only other person to bear witness to the demise of a digital sleuth whose body of work would have made any real spy proud. 'I mean psychologists and therapists will tell you that if you have a particularly difficult period, you can mark that period with a ritual,' said Ugur. 'So ritualising something actually helps you put it behind you. I thought, actually, good riddance.' It was time for the two researchers to start focusing on the material they had collected and had not been able to process while so deeply immersed in the character they had just buried in a forest with a minute's silence 'I laugh about her all the time,' reflected Annsar. 'We always remember Anna.' But there was one more thing they needed to do; confront Amjad with what they knew about him. 'Because how long do you want to go on courting a mukhabarat [intelligence] officer,' asked Ugur. 'I think that the moment where he opened up about his brother, and that he committed revenge, that's as close as you can get in this particular context.' Over Facebook messenger, Anssar, using her real identity this time rather than 'Anna', sent Amjad a 14 second sequence of video. 'His first question was: 'Is that me in the video?' I said: 'Yes it's you.' He said: 'Yeah, it's me. But what does this video tell? Nothing. I'm arresting someone, and that's my job.'' Realising the consequences of what he had just been shown, Amjad then railed against members of the National Defence Front, the militia that the rookie who had leaked the video had belonged to. He described them as thugs and killers and said he was not like them. Then the subterfuge stopped, and Amjad defiantly embraced what he had done. 'I'm proud of what I did', he wrote in a message, before threatening to kill her and her family. Neither Annsar nor Ugur have responded to Amjad since February and have blocked him from their social media accounts. However, he has tried to reach out several times. He is clearly nervous about what lies ahead, as well he may be. War crimes prosecutions in Germany have started to break the armour of impunity that has shrouded the Assad regime in Syria. Yet those court hearings do not contain the same overwhelming evidence as depicted in the Tadamon massacre video. Before this story could be told, however, one man needed to get to safety - the person who had leaked the video to a friend in France, and then to Ugur and Annsar. Some time in the last six months, he started his dangerous journey. Leaving the regime in Syria is never easy. Anyone hoping to travel to other parts of the county, or especially abroad, faces a long process of questioning before being allowed to do so. Although Assad retains power, the area he controls has shrunk, and two powerful overlords, Iran and Russia, have veto over many state decisions. Opposition groups retain control of the north-west, and the Kurds have aegis in the north-east. Syria remains broken and unreconciled; a place where even family members can be suspected of being traitors in waiting. And that is how it was when a young man set off from the Syrian capital for Aleppo in the past six months on the first leg of a journey that would take him to the opposition-held north, then to Turkey and onwards to Europe. The drive to Aleppo was a nervous one. He had been allowed to leave, but would the dreaded intelligence units catch up with him before he made it beyond their clutches? On Aleppo's northern outskirts, a colonel from the 4th division of the Syrian army pocketed a $1,500 (PS1,187) bribe in return for allowing the man across the no man's land separating both sides. The journey was delayed a day, as a Captagon shipment was readied by the 4th division to cross the same route. Shortly after, a truck carrying dozens of kilos of the stimulant, made and distributed by the regime and exported across the Middle East, made its way to the opposition-held north. The source soon followed. Several weeks later, Annsar met him in Turkey, where gaps in the story of Tadamon were filled in over weeks of discussions, and notes for a war crimes prosecution steadily put in order. In February, Ugur and Annsar handed over the videos and their notes, comprising thousands of hours of interviews, to prosecutors in the Netherlands, Germany and France. In the same month in Germany, came the first ever prosecution of another Syrian military intelligence official, Anwar Raslan, for his role in overseeing the murder of at least 27 prisoners and torture of at least 4,000 others. He was convicted of crimes against humanity and has been imprisoned for life. Annsar remains estranged from her family and in her words, is not the same person she was before she started this project. 'But it was worth it,' she said. 'It was exhausting, but I hope our work will help bring justice.' Tadamon these days is a bustling part of the capital that looks like war never darkened its doorsteps. Much of the damage and the atrocities have been covered over by buildings, carparks, or piles of the flotsam and jetsam of conflict. Annsar and Ugur remain convinced that many more massacres took place there and have been piecing together locations and the names of those who went missing in the savage tussle for control of the suburb. 'The locals blame the regime,' said Ugur. 'They know who killed their loved ones. The strange thing is that the people who were killed in this video were not dissidents, they were onside with the regime. You can see they are not malnourished. They are straight from checkpoints, not dungeons. They were killed as a warning not to consider crossing sides. Their families deserve justice.' The source, meanwhile, is safe outside Syria. In fleeing his surroundings - the innermost circle of the Assad regime - he has condemned himself to a life of exile. 'He is happy with his decision,' said Annsar. 'Sometimes people just want to do the right thing. If I've learned anything out of this, it's that there's good in people. That truth can still eventually see the light.'", "9062bea59c7036fce8e70e2c94f1bc0cdb7baece8fc19c3a40c820bb": "Jose Moreno and Katerin Huertas have walked and hitchhiked hundreds of miles. Moreno, 20, wears beach sandals and carries a backpack stuffed with baby clothes, nappies and oat milk. Huertas, 22, carries their seven-month-old son, Kylean, strapped to her chest. They cross a knee-deep river and scramble up a muddy slope in the sweltering heat. But the worst of their journey is yet to come. Ahead of them lies one of the most dangerous border crossings in the world: the Darien Gap, a lawless, roadless region of mountainous jungle, venomous snakes, fast-flowing rivers and murderous drug traffickers that connects South and Central America. According to official data from the Panama government shared with the Guardian, more than 13,000 people illegally crossed from Colombia into Panama via the Darien Gap in the first three months of 2022: nearly triple the number during the same period last year. About 133,000 people made the journey in 2021 - the highest on record for any year by far. The latest figures have alarmed human rights organisations and UN officials, who fear numbers will continue to rise. They warn that the combination of wars and conflict, the climate crisis and the fallout from the Covid pandemic is sending a constant flow of tens of thousands of desperate, vulnerable people from around the world through the Darien Gap - which only a few hundred migrants a year would have braved a decade ago. 'There is serious concern that the numbers could go up very significantly,' says Michele Klein Solomon, regional director for the UN's International Organization for Migration. 'We don't see this abating.' Many of the migrants are robbed, raped and murdered by traffickers and armed groups. Women sometimes give birth along the way. About a quarter of those making the journey are children, most of them under five.  'There's no such thing as a safe route through the Darien,' says Klein Solomon. At least 51 people died trying to cross the region in 2021, she says, adding: 'We know that's a very significant underestimate.' The Guardian accompanied migrants as they set out from Capurgana - a small beach town popular with Colombian tourists on the south-eastern edge of the Darien, accessible only by air or sea - into the jungle. So far this year, about a third are from crisis-torn Venezuela, with nearly as many from Haiti. Others come from as far as Senegal, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Bangladesh, Uzbekistan and China. Most are groups of young men, or families with children. Moreno and Huertas are part of a group of about 20 people heading north, 'for a better future for our children', says Moreno. 'Getting to the United States, American soil - the American dream.' The situation back home in Venezuela is 'terrible', he adds. 'Crime is rising, the cost of food is rising, and salaries aren't going up.' He worked for nine months selling fruit on the street in Chile and Peru.  Not far behind the Venezuelans on the trail is a group of seven people - including three children aged between one and three - from Haiti. Shiller Rebi, 50, and Herold Louis, 41, spent three years working on construction sites in Santa Catarina, Brazil, to raise enough money for the trek north with their families. 'Haiti is in many crises,' says Rebi. 'Economic crisis, a presidential crisis ... We don't have work, we can't earn money to eat, to pay for school.' They hope to reach Mexico and then, maybe, the United States. Also making the journey are two families from Angola. Nine months earlier, Simao Vieira had fled from the African country, and his job at a telecoms company, after he was attacked during an inter-ethnic conflict. 'They were going to kill me,' he says. In Brazil, he had life-saving surgery. But his family experienced racism and struggled to make a living. Vieira, his wife, Ruth and their daughter, Jacira, 12, are now bound for 'any country that receives us and treats us well'. Back in Capurgana, taxi drivers shuttle migrants to a camp on the outskirts of town as soon as they step off the boat. 'We want to help them,' says Carlos Ballesteros, president of a local civic group. The rudimentary compound of breeze blocks will soon include a campsite, a kitchen and a shop, ready to cater to 1,000 people daily. 'Everyone's earning a little bit of cash,' he says. Here, migrants are told what to expect in the jungle - and encouraged to travel light. 'In the jungle you will get to know the dark side of everyone. You have a dream, but you are not obliged to go,' one local organiser tells a subdued group of Venezuelans, including Moreno and Huertas. Then they are left to haggle with some of the 180 local people working as porters and self-described 'guides', who charge as much as $120 (PS95) for each person. The Venezuelans insist they can only scrape together 400,000 Colombian pesos (PS80) in total, but convince someone to take them as far as the border with Panama. There, they will be handed over to indigenous Guna guides. 'I'm not doing harm to anyone,' says Herman Colina, a farmer in rubber boots with a machete at his hip who has grudgingly agreed to accompany the group. He had himself fled poverty and violence elsewhere in Colombia - four of his brothers were killed by guerrillas, he says. According to Colina, the route has become more organised, safer and quicker, in contrast to chaotic scenes last year, when tens of thousands of migrants were camped in nearby towns. It now takes four or five days, down from more than a week. Colina claims that he has rescued migrants with broken bones and dispatched them to faraway hospitals free of charge. But UN officials and local rights organisation workers say that such activities amount to human trafficking - and that guides often extort, sexually assault and abandon their clients. Katiara Mesa, an official in the mayor's office in Capurgana, says they have received no reports of such abuses - but concedes that migrants have no way of raising the alarm. An alternative route by sea to Panama also carries deadly risks. In October, three people died and at least six disappeared - including three children - after an overloaded boat sank while carrying about 30 people from Haiti, Venezuela and Cuba. Several of them were buried in an overgrown corner of the local cemetery. Those that make it to Panama still face a journey of 2,000 miles across half a dozen borders to reach the US. In March, US authorities arrested 210,000 people at the border - the highest monthly total in 20 years. Half of those were deported. The US should make it much easier for refugees and temporary workers to get visas in their home countries, say experts. 'You shouldn't have to make it all the way to the US to claim asylum. It's insane, and only benefits the smugglers,' says Adam Isacson, of the Washington Office on Latin America (Wola), a US human rights organisation. Panama also bears responsibility for the lawlessness of the Darien, says Isacson. 'It's 60 miles of trail. Why is there not a single policeman there? You can't leave people unprotected for that long.' Klein Solomon says Panama and other host countries such as Brazil, Colombia and Chile need more international funding to receive and integrate migrants. 'They haven't got the resources,' she says. None of the many dangers - or the risk of deportation at their destination - deter the group of Venezuelans from the journey. 'We hope all this effort isn't in vain,' says Huertas, hoisting her backpack again and checking on her baby. 'To have the opportunity to get ahead, to work, to give the kids a good future. That's the most important thing, right?'", "e0eb9b0359f9fc3728d0ead837c4e5204a6e8e62056ed897651cd995": "", "afd2ef29b41b4b267ae5467ced52694aa17ebc13db4707dae4e6cb91": "Charles McCrory is haunted by a memory from his 1985 trial in which he was accused of murdering his wife, Julie Bonds, in a bloody attack at their home in Andalusia, a small town in deepest Alabama. What haunts him is the look on the jurors' faces as they listened to the testimony of the prosecution's star witness, a dentist named Richard Souviron. He was a founding father of a cutting-edge branch of forensic science known as bite-mark analysis, which claimed to be able to identify violent criminals by matching their unique dental patterns to the bite wounds on victims' bodies. McCrory was expecting Souviron's evidence to be nuanced. In his initial report, the dentist had been cautious about what could be deduced from two puncture marks found on the upper right arm of Julie's body, saying that the injuries were insufficiently distinct to allow a positive match with the perpetrator. But that was not what he told the jury. When Souviron was asked whether the two marks were teeth marks, he said: 'Yes.' Then the prosecutor asked him: 'In your expert opinion, based on the evidence presented to you, were these teeth marks made by Charles McCrory?' 'Yes,' the dentist replied. McCrory remembers vividly the sinking feeling he experienced in that moment, given the glaring contrast between Souviron's initial report and what he was now saying in court. 'I was in disbelief at his testimony being so different,' he recalled. 'I knew it was extremely damaging to our case. You could see it in the eyes of the jurors.' McCrory shared his recollections of that critical instant in a handwritten letter he sent to the Guardian earlier this month. It was composed from an Alabama prison cell where he is serving a life sentence, still protesting his innocence, 37 years after the jury returned a guilty verdict based on that one simple word: 'Yes.' McCrory's current lawyer is Chris Fabricant. Together with co-counsel Mark Loudon-Brown, Fabricant is representing the prisoner in an epic battle to clear his name almost four decades after he was identified as the source of those supposed teeth marks on his wife's body. For Fabricant, this is much more than a routine criminal case. It is the latest chapter in a personal voyage that began 10 years ago, when he embarked on his exploration of the murky waters of forensic science. Fabricant is director of strategic litigation at the Innocence Project, the formidable New York-based non-profit that for 30 years has used DNA evidence to overturn hundreds of wrongful convictions. He is an authority on the perils and limitations of science as it has been applied to criminal justice. In that role, he has become one of forensic science's most piercing critics. He has highlighted the part played by 'expert witnesses' - forensic dentists, ballistics experts, FBI laboratory agents, lie detector examiners, blood stain investigators  - in inadvertently putting innocent people behind bars. He has a word for it: junk science. In his new book, Junk Science and the American Criminal Justice System, Fabricant explains what he means by the term. 'Junk science sounds like science,' he writes, 'but there is no empirical base for the 'expert opinion'; it is subjective speculation masquerading as science.' The world of junk science took off in the late 1960s and 70s - an era in which confidence about the ability of scientists to propel humanity to giddy new heights was unbound. If science could put a man on the moon, then surely it could do the much more mundane job of nailing violent criminals? Fabricant told the Guardian that there were problems with the new forensic science techniques from their inception. The methods did not arise out of the usual scientific method that starts with a problem, develops an hypothesis to solve it, then tests it via empirical methods. Rather, it turned the formula on its head. Start with a desired solution - banging up criminals - then work back to the science that would support it. 'Most of the new theories emerged not from a scientific laboratory but from a crime scene,' Fabricant explained. 'An enterprising investigator would think, 'Maybe I could match this suspect's teeth to the bite on this victim's nose - that would prove the suspect is the murderer'. Then off they'd go and find an expert witness who could back the theory up.' The explosion in junk science began with forensic pathologists who, with the enthusiastic encouragement of the FBI's legendary crime laboratory, began to invent a plethora of new forensic practices. The new generation of techniques had this in common: they all claimed to be able to identify an individual perpetrator through forensic analysis of various types of crime scene evidence. There was 'hair microscopy' - the idea that a single hair retrieved from the scene of a murder could be put under the microscope and matched with high degrees of certainty to the suspect's hair. There were lie detector tests sold under the portentous title 'polygraphs'; voice spectrometry to identify a criminal through forensic deconstruction of their speech; 'toolmark' analysis that sought to link marks found at a crime scene to a specific object - a pipe, perhaps, or hammer; and comparative bullet lead analysis that professed to be able to match a bullet found at the scene of a killing to the single box of bullets from which it originated. As use of the new techniques began to spread across the US, the reputation of forensic pathologists soared. They were invited to attend specialist conferences around the world, and lauded as 'medical detectives'. Celebrity status wasn't far behind. One of the earliest stars of the genre, New York's medical examiner Dr Milton Helpern, was called 'Sherlock Holmes with a microscope'. His successor, Dr Michael Baden, was given his own HBO TV series in the 1970s. Autopsy showcased a new forensic technique each week, highlighting the wonders they performed in solving gruesome and knotty crimes. Baden later went on to be involved in high-profile cases such as the OJ Simpson trial and the autopsy of Michael Brown, the unarmed Black teenager shot dead by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. Following the rise of such celebrities, it was but a step to forensic science becoming infused into the popular imagination. TV shows that had lionized vice cops and FBI special agents now began to switch their soft-focus lenses on to forensic pathologists. Forensic Files aired from 1996 to 2005. CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, a formidably popular show aired between 2000 and 2015, looked at how forensic scientists cracked the hardest criminal cases. Once this glowing view of forensics had taken hold of the small screen, it was inevitable that it would seep into the mindset of juries. 'These TV shows depict an unrealistic infallibility of forensic sciences which became part of our popular culture,' Fabricant said. 'Jurors walk into court believing that if it is forensic science that ties this defendant to the crime, then the likelihood of their guilt is overwhelming.' With forensic pathologists soaking up so much glamorous TV coverage, it was only a matter of time before dentists wanted in on the game. By the late 1970s, as Fabricant chronicles in his book, 'forensic odontology' was starting to emerge, pioneered by a small number of individuals who were portrayed as 'swashbuckling crime fighters, handsome, fit, bawdy, prone to ghoulish humor, comfortable with dead bodies, brilliant. Men's men.' Fabricant quotes the Los Angeles Times remarking admiringly that one of those pioneers, Dr Gerald Vale, hadn't fixed a tooth in years. 'His job is to fill jail cells, not cavities,' the paper gushed. An industry newsletter said about Vale: 'Instead of tracking down decay, he tracks down people!' What united the group of 12 'founding fathers' of forensic odontology was the belief that bite mark evidence could be used as a new tool up there with fingerprints, toxicology and other established methods. But to be taken seriously, the pioneers needed to establish their reputation, and for that they needed to be recognized as a scientific specialism as worthy of respect as any pathologist. They began in 1976 by forming an 'odontology section' within America's top professional forensics body, the American Academy of Forensic Sciences. Not content with playing second fiddle, they then created their own organization, the American Board of Forensic Odontology (ABFO). As icing on the cake, they granted themselves a fancy title: 'diplomates', they called themselves, signaling their specialist status as trained and authoritative experts. So when Souviron travelled the country to appear as a star expert witness in criminal cases such as McCrory's murder trial, he did so not as Richard Souviron, dentist from Florida, but as Dr Richard Souviron, board-certified diplomate and member of the ABFO. How could a jury resist that? 'This was 1985, when to fly an 'expert' witness in from Florida was practically unheard of,' McCrory wrote in his letter to the Guardian, referring to his own trial. 'No jury, as lay people, have the ability to genuinely question a supposed expert, especially back then.' The problem was, bite mark analysis, like many of the new forensic techniques, was founded upon so much hot air. There are two stages involved in matching a wound to an individual perpetrator, and both of them are flakey. The first is categorically to confirm that the wound is caused by someone's teeth and not by some other sharp object. The second stage is to link the alleged bite mark to the dental pattern of the suspect, by taking a mould of the suspect's teeth and comparing it to the wound. Analysis in both those stages, contrary to the scientific method, is subjective. A study published in 2009 by New York scientists tested whether skin could accurately record the impressions left by teeth - the 3D-equivalent of a fingerprint - and found that it could not. The scientists simulated 23 identical bites on a single piece of un-embalmed cadaver skin. They discovered that the bites produced 23 entirely different marks, each one bearing little resemblance to the rest. A more detailed study in 2015, carried out by ABFO-certified forensic dentists themselves, asked 38 of their fellow 'diplomates' to review photographs presented in real criminal cases where bite mark analysis had been used. Of the 100 cases they examined, the analysts reached unanimous agreement in only four. These two experiments effectively toppled the entire house of cards upon which bite mark analysis had been erected. In his book, Fabricant concludes that when forensic dentists presented juries with a 'near certain' match between the marks on a victim and a suspect - as Souviron did at McCrory's trial - all they were doing was expressing their own personal opinion. It is a paradox that it took science to overcome junk science. 'Nothing else could have challenged it other than DNA evidence, because a clean DNA sample is indisputable,' Fabricant said. 'DNA was like a truth serum that the justice system had never before been exposed to.' Over the years, DNA analysis has demonstrated itself to be blessed with all the qualities that junk science claims to enjoy but lacks: reliability, certainty, accuracy, indisputability. The DNA revolution was launched in 1992 when two young lawyers in New York City decided to take on the combined might of the criminal justice system just as it was getting into its mass incarceration stride. Barry Sheck and Peter Neufeld founded the Innocence Project to take on cases where crime scene evidence allowed DNA testing to be carried out. They used it to expose wrongful convictions and secure exonerations - more than 200 to date attained by the Innocence Project alone. As time passed, the group's crack team of lawyers observed that in so many of the wrongful convictions, the prosecution had relied upon the testimony of forensic scientists. Almost half of the total of 375 exonerations that have been achieved by the Innocence Project and other groups using DNA evidence involved the misuse of forensic sciences. The dawning realization that junk science might have put a vast mountain of innocent people behind bars has inspired the Innocence Project to make a historic revision of its mission. As it approaches its 30th anniversary this year, the organization has decided to widen the net of cases that it takes on to include those where no DNA evidence is available. That's a big change in focus. Up to now, the Innocent Project has pinpointed its energies almost exclusively on DNA. But what about people who cannot call on DNA to prove their innocence, maybe because there were insufficient crime scene materials, or maybe because such materials were destroyed post-trial? Are those people to be abandoned with little hope of ever receiving justice? 'Those who can be exonerated with DNA evidence represent just the tip of the iceberg,' Christina Swarns, the executive director of the Innocence Project, told the Guardian. 'Going forward, the Innocence Project will begin to accept non-DNA cases and we will approach them with the same tenacity, innovation and client-centered approach we brought to our DNA work.' This is a significant paradigm shift for an organization that put the concept of wrongful conviction on the map, both in the United States and around the world. By widening its focus to include non-DNA cases, Fabricant believes it will herald 'a new era of innocence litigation that will involve undoing the legacy of junk science'. Which prompts the question: how many innocent people are out there? 'I shudder to think,' Fabricant said. 'There are 2.3 million people incarcerated in this country. Even if the wrongful conviction rate were 1% , and that's conservative, you are looking at tens of thousands of people.' Fabricant is convinced that McCrory, who is now 62, is one of them. 'Mr McCrory is obviously innocent, and he would be out right now if we had DNA evidence.' Julie Bonds was murdered on 31 May 1985 in her home in Andalusia, south Alabama. McCrory was not living in the house at the time - the couple had recently separated after 10 years of marriage; they had one son together. McCrory and his father discovered her body after they called on the house, worried that she was not answering the phone. She had been badly beaten, and had a deep wound to her skull. The 1985 McCrory trial was held just before DNA analysis came on stream - the first time DNA was used to convict someone was in Florida in 1987, while the first DNA exoneration followed two years later in Chicago. Because it was presumed to serve no further useful purpose, all the crime scene materials collected in the Bonds murder investigation were destroyed  - a routine event in pre-DNA days. That left no biological samples to test once DNA was commonplace.  Detectives investigating the Bonds murder actually found hairs clutched in the hand of McCrory's murdered wife that conventional examinations conducted at the time ruled out as having come from him. But the hairs, along with everything else, were binned. Other evidence also pointed to McCrory's innocence. At the time of Bonds' killing, a construction worker was being employed on a building project in the house next door. He wore a red bandana. Five weeks after Julie Bonds was murdered, that same man was arrested for breaking into a different home and raping the owner. He served 20 years in prison. At that crime scene, officers found a red bandana. Despite the inconsistencies in his case, McCrory was at a powerful disadvantage. Without the benefit of DNA to clear his name, he languished in prison for decades. Meanwhile, however, bitemark analysis was beginning to unravel.  In 2009 - by which time McCrory had spent 24 years in prison - the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) released a 300-page report on the use of forensic science that sent what Fabricant called a 'thunderbolt' across the criminal justice system. It was searingly critical of 13 forensic techniques that were routinely being used in criminal trials. It reserved its most scathing denunciation for bitemark analysis. The report's authors noted that the claim that dentists could positively identify a perpetrator by matching their dental patterns to marks on victims' bodies had never been supported by any scientific study. Indeed, 'no large population studies have been conducted'. In other words, bitemark analysis was an unsubstantiated whim on the part of its inventors. The report concluded that there was 'no evidence of an existing scientific basis for identifying an individual to the exclusion of all others'. The combined impact of the NAS report and DNA evidence led to a renewed focus on criminal cases where bitemark analysis had been critical to the prosecution. Scientific certainty began to crumble. Exonerations mounted up. Today, the tally of people who have been exonerated after wrongful indictment or conviction involving bitemark analysis stands at 35. They include several of Fabricant's clients: Keith Allen Harward, exonerated in 2016 after spending 33 years in prison for a rape and murder he did not commit; Stephen Chaney, exonerated in 2019 after 28 years behind bars; Eddie Lee Howard, exonerated in 2020 - 26 years inside. They were the lucky ones. David Wayne Spence was convicted of murdering three teenagers in 1982 after his teeth were matched to bite marks on the victims' bodies. On 3 April 1997, he was strapped to a gurney and lethal drugs injected into his veins. He went to his death insisting he was innocent. In December 2019, Souviron recanted his testimony. He had taken another look at the evidence in the case, considered it alongside the criticisms raised by the NAS report, and went on the record to say he had been wrong. 'While this testimony was understood by myself and others within my field as scientifically acceptable at the time of trial, I would not give [it] today,' he said in an affidavit. 'As a forensic odontologist I no longer believe the individualised teeth marks comparison testimony I offered in his case was reliable or proper. I therefore renounce that testimony.' The Guardian reached out to Souviron to ask him how he came to change his thinking so radically, but his office said he was not available. The dentist's reversal was sweet music to McCrory's ears. 'We knew a recantation from the state's own witness, their only forensic witness, would eviscerate their case. At that point the only fair way forward would be a new trial,' the prisoner wrote. McCrory duly petitioned for a new trial. With no forensic evidence of any sort, and with no other substantive evidence to rely upon, the state's tank was running on empty. Even the prosecutors admitted that McCrory posed no harm to the public. In April last year, on the eve of a court hearing to determine whether a new trial should be granted, the prisoner was offered a plea deal. He could walk free, that very same day, on one condition. He had to plead guilty to his wife's murder. He declined the deal, opting to stay in his cell. 'That was an easy decision,' he wrote in his letter to the Guardian. 'I did not murder her ... I didn't do it, and I'm not admitting to it.' He added: 'Someone murdered Julie. Someone knows who it is. We are seeking the truth, not falsely confessing to a crime I didn't commit.' Many people would find McCrory's rejection of a deal that would have instantly set him free hard to comprehend. Fabricant is among them. 'I can understand it in an intellectual way, but as a human being I think after 36 years I'd want to go home,' he said. McCrory still hasn't gone home. It has now been 37 years and counting. The bitemark case against him has been thoroughly debunked, but it turns out that doesn't matter. Junk science proves to be scarily resilient - an invasive weed that grows rampant across the country, poisoning the criminal justice system as it spreads. A few days after McCrory turned down the plea deal, an evidentiary hearing was held in front of Judge Charles Short in Andalusia, Alabama, to discuss the request for a new trial. Souviron's recantation was presented to the court, as was the testimony of three other forensic dentists who not only confirmed that the marks on Julie Bond's body could not be matched to the prisoner, they said that the marks were not even caused by teeth in the first place. Judge Short listened to this devastating argument, took in all the other evidence of McCrory's innocence, then issued his ruling: there would be no new trial; McCrory would remain in prison. Fabricant was uncharacteristically lost for words when he tried to describe his reaction to the judgment. 'How can that be? How can that be? It's preposterous. We are in 2022 and a judge is refusing a new trial even when the scientist in question has recanted. He is keeping an innocent man in prison based on nothing.' Despite the knock-back, McCrory says he is keeping his spirits up. 'I'm optimistic that justice will prevail,' he wrote at the end of his letter. 'Every time we have run into a seemingly dead-end, a door has opened. We will not stop until we have the truth.' This will be scant comfort to McCrory, but he is not alone. Fabricant points out that bitemark analysis is still admissible in all 50 states of the union. Three of the most influential bitemark cases where marks were matched to 'guilty' perpetrators have all ended in exonerations. Yet the cases retain their status as 'good law' and continue to be cited as precedent in court to this day. In the wider world of junk science, not only do discredited techniques continue to be used, but new techniques keep popping up. Fabricant rattles off three examples of forensic innovations that are beginning to ring alarm bells. There's forensic podiatry, where foot doctors claim they can identify a perpetrator from their gait; cadaver dogs which are supposedly able to sniff out the presence of a human corps even years after the body may have been present; and ShotSpotter, an audio system that purports to be able to isolate the sound of gun shots from other noise in urban areas. If that all sounds depressingly familiar, that's because it is. 'Our goal in the Innocence Project is to go out of business - we aspire to become unnecessary,' Fabricant said.

The Russian president told lawmakers in St Petersburg on Wednesday the west wanted to cut Russia into pieces and accused it of pushing Ukraine into conflict with Moscow. 'If someone intends to intervene in the ongoing events from the outside, and create strategic threats for Russia that are unacceptable to us, they should know that our retaliatory strikes will be lightning-fast,' said Putin. 'We have all the tools for this, things no one else can boast of having now. And we will not boast, we will use them if necessary. And I want everyone to know that.' His comments came as British foreign secretary Liz Truss called for a 'doubling down' on support for Ukraine in a speech on Wednesday night, including further supplies of heavy weapons, and for allies to push for Russian forces to entirely leave Ukraine's territory, with the country reverting to its pre-2014 borders. In reference to Russian-occupied areas in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, she said: 'We are going to keep going further and faster to push Russia out of the whole of Ukraine.' There has been speculation that Ukraine would settle for a return to the pre-invasion status quo where territory was ceded to de facto Russian-backed separatists. She called Putin 'a desperate rogue operator with no interest in international norms'. 'Some argue we shouldn't provide heavy weapons for fear of provoking something worse. But my view, is that inaction would be the greatest provocation. This is a time for courage not for caution,' she said, admitting that more should have been done to deter an invasion. Truss warned Putin that the west would come to the defence of Moldova in the same way as it is defending Ukraine if Russia mounted an attack there, as seems possible. She said the UK was digging deep into its inventories, including heavy weapons, tanks and aeroplanes, to defend Ukraine and other countries threatened by Russia. She also said future Russian access to the global economy 'will depend on playing by the rules. There can be no more free passes'. In other developments: The G7 group of industrialised nations is examining whether it could reimpose the current punitive economic sanctions if Russia tries to renege on a hypothetical future peace deal imposed by western allies. Britain has long said the war must end with Putin being seen to fail, but the containment terms being proposed by western officials include a permanent weakening of the Russian military forces so they can no longer pose a threat to eastern Europe, as well as Russia pulling out of all territory it has occupied, including Crimea, which it annexed in 2014. Lloyd Austin, the US defence secretary, this week in Germany hinted at the thinking by saying the US wanted the war to end with Russia so weakened it could not repeat its attack on Ukraine. British thinking reflects a growing confidence that the political, economic and military forces ranged against Putin can, in the long term, lead to his complete defeat. London also detects a change of mood in Washington - and to a lesser extent, Berlin - including a greater willingness to supply weaponry to Nato standards rather than hand-downs from old Warsaw Pact armoury. Britain envisages the security guarantees to Kyiv would largely consist of a commitment to arm Ukraine enough that Russia would not mount an attack. Britain does not favour a Nato-style commitment that Ukraine's allies would intervene to protect Ukraine if it was threatened by Russia. Critics will say very tough settlement demands run the risk of forcing Putin into a corner so that he threatens the use of tactical weapons. But the Russian leader has already threatened to use nuclear weapons if red lines were crossed. In her speech, Truss also set out a warning to China claiming its rise will not be inevitable if it ignores the rules. Explaining that China is not impervious to western economic pressure, she said China needs to trade with the G7 since it represents around half of the global economy.", "adefc3b94d9f55eaa33cb2d60f97c0bef56f4d89545f362da744e2ac": "Efforts are under way to get emergency contraception into Ukrainian hospitals as quickly as possible, as reports of rape after the Russian invasion continue to rise. About 2,880 packets of the medication, also known as the morning-after pill, have been sent by International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) to Ukraine, while a network of volunteers across Europe has been collecting donations of the medication from abroad and delivering them to hospitals.  'The timeframe for treating victims of sexual violence is really essential,' said Julie Taft, of IPPF. 'If a woman is seen within five days of an event, then that medication should automatically be given to her.' Taft said the IPPF was also sending medical abortion pills, which can be used up to 24 weeks of pregnancy. While emergency contraception was widely available in Ukraine, the war has destroyed local supply chains, caused a displacement of patients and healthcare providers, and increased the rate of sexual assaults. 'There is a demand for emergency contraception, but very rarely from hospitals in the west. It is mostly hospitals to the east, in Kharkiv, Mariupol, those regions,' said Joel Mitchell from Paracrew, a humanitarian aid organisation delivering food and medical equipment to Ukraine. 'As soon as we made contact with hospitals in those regions, we had standing orders for that medication.' It is not clear how many of the recipients of the medication are sexual assault victims, but a volunteer with Paracrew told the Guardian that he delivered emergency contraception directly to one hospital in a town north of Kyiv, where he says he was told by hospital staff a number of rape victims were being treated. Ukraine's human rights commissioner, Lyudmila Denisova, said in early April that there were nine official cases of women who were pregnant after being raped by Russian soldiers. The reports of rape victims raise concerns about areas in the east, which continue to be under Russian occupation. Jamie Nadal from the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) said that in a crisis situation reported cases of violence, including rape, are likely 'just the tip of the iceberg.' The UN has previously included emergency contraception in 'post-rape kits' to hundreds of women and girls in armed conflicts around the world, including the Bosnian war. In addition to emergency contraception, survivors typically were given medication preventing STDs such a hepatitis B and HIV. Distributing the medication to rape survivors in post-conflict zones remains a UN policy. So far UN has sent 40 metric tonnes (40,000 kg) of reproductive health supplies to Ukraine and 33 Clinical Management of Rape (CMR) and Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) kits to 19 Hospitals in 10 regions in Ukraine. Denisova has said her office had officially documented the cases of 25 women who were kept in a basement and systematically raped in Bucha, a town north of Kyiv now synonymous with Russian war crimes, but the true number of victims could be far higher. A volunteer who evacuated residents from the towns north of Kyiv at the beginning of April told the Guardian: 'What usually happens is that survivors of rape initially want to tell their story but then they go away and it isn't until months later that they come back to talk.' She said she had encountered three women in the region who came out of houses and basements naked. One, immediately taken by ambulance, had been badly beaten and had broken bones. The Guardian reported this week that postmortem examinations on bodies in mass graves north of Kyiv revealed evidence that some women had been raped before being killed by Russian forces. 'There are multiple psychological, emotional and physical health issues that the survivor is coping with and the anxiety around possible pregnancy is really enormous for many women,' said Taft. 'It can lead to stress and PTSD, so being able to prevent it in the first place is key.' However, the supply of pills within Ukraine has been badly damaged by the invasion and volunteers who spoke to the Guardian described multiple logistical issues delaying attempts to get the much-needed medication into the country. 'Many pharmaceuticals were previously produced in Ukraine but much of that manufacturing has stopped or became stuck in major cities because transportation is not safe,' said Taft. 'Additionally, the current capacity of health providers and commodities [is insecure], particularly because we're seeing a lot of destruction of health facilities.'  Aleksandra Weder Sawicka, a Polish activist based in Oslo who worked with Paracrew, coordinated a collection of 500 pills from Norway but drew scrutiny from the Norwegian directorate of health, which did not condone the informal donation of the medication. A big pharmacy chain in Norway also refused to deliver the medication to her for that reason. She has had to stop further donations while she tries to reach an agreement with Norwegian authorities to allow her to continue the work. Taft said the strict control of the medication in some countries along Ukraine's border, such as Romania, Hungary and Poland, had made the procurement of the pills more expensive, challenging and time consuming. 'In those countries you can't buy emergency medication in bulk,' she said, 'so we had to procure them from providers in Denmark and the Netherlands.' Krystyna Kacpura, director of Federa, a Polish organisation advocating for women's rights and reproductive health, said: 'International organisations reached out in the first days of the war offering to send over emergency contraception, but we had to advise them to send it straight to Ukraine through the Czech Republic, as we couldn't be seen handling controlled substances.'

The US Naval Institute (USNI) reviewed satellite imagery of the naval base at Sevastopol harbor, and concluded that two dolphin pens were moved to the base in February at the start of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Russia has a history of training dolphins for military purposes, using the aquatic mammal to retrieve objects or deter enemy divers. The Sevastopol naval base is crucial for the Russian military, as it sits in the southern tip of Crimea which Moscow seized in 2014. According to the USNI's analysis, many of the Russian ships anchored there, while out of range from missiles, are potentially vulnerable to undersea attacks. Ukraine had also trained dolphins at an aquarium near Sevastopol, in a program born out of a Soviet-era scheme that fell into neglect in the 1990s. During the cold war, both the US and the Soviet Union developed the use of dolphins whose echolocation capabilities can allow them to detect underwater objects such as mines. The US has spent at least $28m maintaining its own troops of dolphins and sea lions - which are also trainable - to potentially help with conflicts. The Sevastopol program was resurrected in 2012 by the Ukrainian navy, but the mammals fell into Russian hands after the 2014 invasion of Crimea. Ukraine unsuccessfully demanded the return of the animals, and RIA Novosti reported that Moscow planned to expand the scheme. 'Our specialists developed new devices that convert dolphins' underwater sonar detection of targets into a signal to the operator's monitor. The Ukrainian navy lacked funds for such know-how, and some projects had to be mothballed,' one source told the Russian news agency. Two years later, the Russian navy announced plans to buy five more dolphins, launching a bidding process for a 1.75m ruble - about $21,000 - contract to deliver dolphins to the Sevastopol base by the end of the summer. It is unclear whether the dolphins believed to be in Sevastopol today are the same ones that came out of this contract. Satellite imagery from 2018 revealed Russia also used dolphins at its naval base in Tartus, Syria during the Syrian war. Dolphins are not the only ocean creatures that Russian military may have trained. A beluga whale spotted off the coast of Norway in 2019 was believed to be trained by the Russian navy. Fishermen reported a beluga whale wearing strange harnesses, which may have held cameras, harassing their boats, pulling on straps and ropes from the side of boats.

From February until just this week, Mexico has been their second-to-last stop in a weeks-long journey; Tijuana a two- or three-day respite on the way to something better, something safer, where their children can slowly work toward normalcy after their lives were upended by war. These displaced families - a flight away from Washington state or Illinois or South Carolina - are fanning out across the country, staying with friends and relatives, applying for food stamps and social security cards and enrolling their children in school. While they are far further in their relocation than the Mexican, Central American and Haitian asylum seekers waiting years for that same opportunity, these newcomers still face many hurdles. 'Everything is so different here in the US,' said Anastasiia Puzhalina, a Ukrainian refugee who arrived in the States in early April with her family. 'We must learn so much. I hope we'll get through this.' More than 5.2 million people have fled Ukraine since the start of the invasion; another 7.7 million have left their homes but remain inside the country. More than 1,000 education facilities have been attacked - the figure probably includes an art school where 400 people were sheltered - according to the United Nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs. The Russian invasion has been chaotic, surprisingly inept and unbearably brutal, often targeting civilians. Thousands have died - the exact number is a subject of debate and might not be known for years - with hundreds discovered in mass graves. Women and girls have been particularly vulnerable to sexual assault. All of which has forced families with means to make their way out. The refugees who arrive in Tijuana enter the encampment with pained expressions, scrambling to corral their children and their belongings, their anxiety evidenced in their sharp tones and lack of patience with the worn-out youngsters they tote. Once inside, their mood shifts. Handed a water bottle and ice-cream by dozens of Ukrainian and Russian-speaking volunteers, many of whom flew down from the US to assist, they are directed to a check-in desk where a smiling woman assigns each individual, couple or family a number that will be called when it's time to leave. Other aid workers will drive them to their next stop: often San Diego international airport. That's exactly what Puzhalina was waiting for. She listened carefully to each number, eager for hers: 2567. Sitting under the partial shade of a palm tree, she said the family felt safe in the encampment, though they were told not to venture out into the city. Tijuana, population 1.3 million, saw 1,972 homicides in 2021. By comparison, there were 485 in New York City, more than six times its size. The family didn't stay in Mexico for long: within days, they flew to Tacoma, Washington. Anatoli Bassarskii, 37, of Chernivtsi in western Ukraine, hadn't decided where he and his family would move. No matter where they settle, they intend to enroll their 10-year-old son Artur in school right away so he can learn English and have only a minimal disruption to his education. Bassarskii is concerned about the fifth grader fitting in. 'With the language barrier and different cliques of kids, I'm worried about him being bullied,' he said through a translator. Artur, handsome with bright blue eyes, had already found playmates upon his arrival to the camp in early April and hoped for the same in the States. He believed his American school would be an improvement over what he had in Ukraine, with better and more up-to-date facilities. An athlete with aspirations of becoming a dentist, he wasn't worried about assimilation. 'I'm sure everyone will say hi to me,' he said, a Nike backpack slung across his shoulders. 'Everyone will be my friend.' His father hopes his son is right, because the family plans to stay in the US permanently. 'We want to live in America forever,' Bassarskii said. Other asylum seekers have not been given the same priority. Fleeing the twin atrocities of gang violence and poverty in their own countries, Mexican, Central American and Haitian refugees have not been offered the expedited pathway laid out for the Ukrainians despite waiting at the border for years. They have been barred by a Covid-era policy called Title 42 which, enacted in March 2020, allowed the US to refuse entry because of health concerns. And their living conditions are atrocious: flimsy tents, flooded by heavy rains and blown away by high winds, sit unguarded and vulnerable in crime-infested places like Reynosa, across the border from McAllen, Texas. Immigrant advocates recognize the disparity and wish for similar treatment for all. 'I believe that everybody who has a legitimate claim and has a fear for their lives should be given the right to enter the US ... It shouldn't matter what country you are coming from,' Sister Norma Pimentel, executive director of Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley in south Texas, told the 74. Her organization has served hundreds of thousands of people crossing over in recent years. But that has not been the case. Last week, Joe Biden, who has already promised to welcome 100,000 Ukrainian refugees, announced 'Unite for Ukraine', an expedited immigration program that will allow those fleeing the country to arrive in the US directly from Europe, bypassing Mexico. They must have been in Ukraine as of 11 February;, have a sponsor who can financially support them (this can be in individual or organization), complete vaccinations and other public health requirements, and pass background checks. The new policy went into effect Monday. Most will receive two years of residence and authorization to work in the US. Those who continue trying to enter the US through Tijuana are subject to Title 42, but that might not last long. The restriction is set to be lifted 23 May, although lawmakers from both parties worry the southern border isn't ready for the influx: tens of thousands of people are waiting for entry, including 9,000 in Reynosa alone, Pimentel said. Adding to these concerns, the supreme court heard oral arguments this week on the Biden administration's attempts to end the 2018 Migrant Protection Protocols, which require some asylum seekers to remain in Mexico for the duration of their US immigration proceedings. US Customs and Border Protection has reported nearly 15,000 encounters with Ukrainian and Russian refugees since the start of the year. It logged more than 349,008 such incidents with asylum seekers from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti and Honduras in that same time period. The children of these Ukrainian families are just starting to trickle into the nation's schools: South Carolina, for example, has 101 more Ukrainian and 29 more Russian students than it did this same time last year. South Carolina school districts that have called the state for assistance in admitting newcomers without transcripts have been reminded of their legal obligation to enroll these students quickly. They're also advised to find proper translation services so they can communicate with their families. They know at least some of these students have experienced trauma and believe schools, flush with cash because of the pandemic, are probably more equipped to help them than in years past. And qualifying South Carolina school districts will see an increase in funding for all new immigrants, no matter their country of origin. 'We want them to feel valued ... and welcomed for all of the expertise they bring to our communities,' said Susan Murphy, who serves multilingual learners at the state level. Oksana Bevzenko, who arrived in Mexico from Kyiv with three of her children, ages 17, 14 and four, planned to relocate to Spartanburg, South Carolina. She spent an afternoon in early April trying to feed her daughter an orange as the child walked along the landing of a large red, blue and yellow piece of playground equipment near the center of the Tijuana encampment. Asked what she wanted for her children in America, she had only one request: peace. Anastasiia Puzhalina, who now lives in Tacoma, has already registered her children in school. Her 10-year-old son, Illia, had expressed worry about that transition, fearing he would be misunderstood because he does not speak English. 'I'm afraid someone will be unfriendly to me because I'm a refugee,' he said when interviewed back at the encampment. 'I wish I could have at least one Ukrainian- or Russian-speaking kid in my class so I could feel comfortable. I want to make friends.' His six-year-old sister, Virsaviia, picking up her brother's trepidation, said she wished her cousin could be in her class, but the child is a full year younger, her mother said. The children started school 21 April 'They loved the first day,' their mother reported. 'They remembered the names of their teachers, but didn't remember some names of their new friends because they sound so different from our Ukrainian. They liked the lunch: burgers and chocolate milk. It sounds like a dream lunch for them. They take English classes most of the time. Everything is like in an American movie for them.' It's difficult to align those images with the terror the family experienced just weeks ago. Food was running low and the local markets were empty in Puzhalina's hometown of Slavutych, near the border of Belarus. Eventually, her community lost both gas and electricity. The family was forced to cook all their food at once, outdoors, on an open flame fueled by wood they gathered from a nearby forest - lest it rot. They had no internet, no working cellphones, no way to see or hear the news of what was happening in Slavutych. The surrounding region had already been bombarded, crucial bridges destroyed. Puzhalina said she asked God to show her 'silence in her heart' so she and her husband would know the exact moment to escape with their three children. So, she waited for when she could no longer hear bombs dropping in the distance. Just then, a neighbor knocked on her door to tell her some of the families in her community were preparing to leave. 'In that moment, I packed our bags, and we left,' she said, pressing a closed fist against her chest. After two days of travel, they crossed into Poland on 15 March. Puzhalina's sister hosted them for a week before they moved on to Germany, where they stayed with another relative for nearly 14 days. Puzhalina's brother-in-law helped the family buy tickets from Frankfurt to Amsterdam to Mexico City and, finally, Tijuana, where they arrived 7 April. There is only one way to describe their safe passage, she said: 'It was a miracle.'", "1ff8be166cd12ae0cebb2c191ff25002d50be245258f5b8f88eaa31c": "At 5.36 pm on Tuesday in the historic Kyiv district of Pecherskyi, an imposing Soviet-era bronze monument symbolising the friendship between Russia and Ukraine was accidentally decapitated and then deliberately dismantled to the applause of hundreds of people. As local officials explained, when one country invades and bombs another, killing its people, their friendship is over. The 40-year-old statue, depicting a Ukrainian and a Russian worker on a plinth, was pulled down on the order of local authorities in Kyiv. It is one of the first steps of a plan to demolish about 60 monuments and to rename dozens of streets associated with the Soviet Union, Russia and Russian figures, including the writers Tolstoy, Dostoevsky and Pushkin, as a result of the war between the two countries. Serhii Myrhorodskyi, 86, an architect from Kyiv, watched excitedly as the head of the Russian worker accidentally broke off from its body and tumbled to the ground during the removal. He did not appear bothered, despite the fact it was he who had designed the monument, erected in 1982 as a gift from the Soviet regime to the Ukrainian government. 'It is the right thing to do,' he told the Guardian. 'There is no friendship with Russia and there will not be any friendship for a long time while Putin and his gang are in this world. After they drop dead, maybe in 30 years, something will change. 'The presence of the monument that represents a friendship with Russia is a sin. Removing it is the only right decision. And we could use that bronze of which the monument is made. We could melt it down and sculpt a new monument dedicated to Ukraine the motherland, which would symbolise the unity of all Ukrainian lands.' 'As for my emotions,' he added, 'I am just happy to see that people are glad this whole thing is being taken away.' As the monument began to fall, the crowd chanted: 'Glory to Ukraine, glory to the heroes, glory to the nation of Ukraine.' The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, who presided over the dismantling, said the removal of Russian symbols from the city was now under way. 'You don't kill your brother. You don't rape your sister. You don't destroy your friend's country. That's why, today, we have dismantled this monument, once created as a sign of friendship between Ukraine and Russia,' he said. Other cities in Ukraine have in recent days begun to rename streets associated with Russian figures or to dismantle monuments related to the Soviet Union. The city of Ternopil, in western Ukraine, has renamed a street dedicated to the Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, and removed a Soviet tank and aircraft. The aircraft is to be replaced with a 'heroes of Ukraine' monument. Fontanka, a village near Odesa, decided to turn a street dedicated to the poet Vladimir Mayakovsky into Boris Johnson Street, after the UK promised to send a PS100m weapons package to Ukraine. And the mayor of Dnipro, Borys Filatov, said streets named after Russian towns would be rededicated to Ukrainian cities and symbols: Abkhazia Street became Irpin, while the street of the 30th Irkutsk Division is now called Ukrainian Soldiers. Officials in Kyiv are to approve a law to rename 60 streets, meaning Russian writers and Ukrainians who wrote in Russian - or even assumed a Russian identity - are among those who may be written out of public life in the city. A metro station named after Tolstoy is on the list. 'The war changed everything and things have accelerated the times,' Alina Mykhailova, one of the two Kyiv city deputies who put forward the law, wrote on Facebook. 'Finally, there is an understanding that [our] colonial heritage must be destroyed.' Mykhailova and her colleague Ksenia Semenova campaigned for the removal of the People's Friendship monument that was dismantled on Tuesday. There had been plans to remove the statue under Ukraine's decommunisation laws passed in 2015, but at the time they received pushback from other members of the Kyiv city council, Mykhailova wrote. The Ukrainian language and Ukrainian national identity were suppressed by tsarist Russia and its Soviet successor. Russian was considered the language of high culture and official business, and many Ukrainians, particularly peasants who moved to the big cities after the second world war, adopted Russian to distance themselves from their rural origins.  Perhaps more controversially, the de-Russification list includes Ukrainian-born writers such as Mikhail - or Mykhailo, in Ukrainian - Bulgakov, who was born in Ukraine, wrote about Kyiv, but had derogatory views about the Ukrainian language and Ukrainian national identity. His statue sits next to his former house on one of Kyiv's most famous streets, which is now the Bulgakov Museum and is popular with tourists. 'Only idiots could do this because Leo Tolstoy is a world-famous writer, not just Russian or Ukrainian,' said Ihor Serhiivych, a Kyiv resident, inside Leo Tolstoy Square metro station. 'There are lots of [ethnic] Russians who live in Kyiv and they are probably doing more right now to protect Ukraine than those western Ukrainians who think of themselves as the elite,' Serhiivych said. He said there was a gulf in understanding between those Ukrainians who lived for a significant period under Soviet and tsarist rule and those in western Ukraine who did not. 'If it was a Putin statue I would understand, but you have to differentiate between enemies and world-famous literature.' Another person at the station, Valetyna Hryhoryvycha, said: 'I think people need to think about it a bit more. I don't see how they relate to what's happening now. It is part of our history.'  Ivan Andreiev, who works near Bulgakov Museum, said: 'I'm for the removal of the friendship monument because there can't be friendship between enemies. But I think it's a fake that they're planning on taking down Bulgakov's monument. What Russian or Ukrainian would vote for such a thing? It's just history.' While Ukrainian authorities are working hard to disassemble the Russian monuments in their country, Moscow is doing the opposite in Ukrainian territories it has occupied, restoring statues and symbols of the Soviet era. Two weeks ago in the seaside town of Henichesk, in the Kherson region, which is occupied by the Russian troops, a familiar figure returned to the main square. A statue of the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin, sporting his familiar goatee and moustache, was back on his pedestal, erected by Russian soldiers. ", "efe8a215d2a231953c8594923f4501bd27c064106103206bce4d29ea": "Step by step, the west's war aims are expanding. What began as an effort to supply 'defensive weapons' to Ukraine has evolved into an attempt to provide heavier weaponry. This week Germany and the UK agreed to supply armoured anti-aircraft artillery vehicles to keep Russia's air force at bay. On Monday Lloyd Austin, the US defence secretary, said the west's goal was to 'weaken Russia' to the point where it could no longer invade or threaten its neighbours. A day later the British junior defence minister James Heappey said it would be 'completely legitimate' for Ukraine to use western weapons to strike inside Russia if need be. These are different, more specific, statements, compared with some of the broad-brush rhetoric used in the early phase of the war when Russian forces were menacing Kyiv, and Ukraine's crisis seemed existential. 'Vladimir Putin's act of aggression must fail and be seen to fail,' Boris Johnson wrote in March. It was a generalised observation by the British prime minister that tactfully avoided spelling out any specific outcome. Yet the language has toughened as the conflict has stalled. On the ground Russia's well-telegraphed assault on the Donbas is still only gradually unfolding, with the gain of a handful of villages near Izyum, where the attempt to envelop Ukraine's forces continues without any sign of a breakthrough, hindered by rainy weather, strong resistance and command and control problems. On the other hand, there is no sign yet that Kyiv's forces can counterattack in the strength required to force Russia back in the Donbas or the south, where Russia said on Tuesday it had captured the entire Kherson region. Meanwhile, the Kremlin has seized on the slowly enhanced weapon supply to sound off. On Monday, Sergei Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, said that Nato was 'in essence ... engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy' in an interview where he also warned of the risks of a third world war and even nuclear conflict. Nato is not at war with Russia, but it is hard not to conclude that the west is engaged in a proxy fight because of the ongoing arms supply. Nevertheless, western officials reject Lavrov's proxy war description, because they do not want to lend legitimacy to any Russian reprisals beyond Ukraine's territory. 'There is a Russian narrative that this is a proxy war between Russia and Nato. It isn't. We are supporting Ukraine in their self-defence,' said one official on Wednesday, partly in an attempt to clarify Heappey's remarks about using western weapons in Russia itself. But given how much Russia is struggling militarily in Ukraine, the idea that Moscow could open a new front by, as Lavrov suggested, striking against weapons delivery in Nato countries, seems unlikely - not least because it would invite a western military response. Nuclear threats are also designed to intimidate, but there remains an irreducible risk that Putin would escalate further if he felt threatened. What is less certain is what the end state of the fighting will be. On Tuesday, Nikolai Patrushev, the powerful head of Russia's security council, said 'the result of the policy of the west and the Kyiv regime under its control can only be the disintegration of Ukraine into several states' in a Russian newspaper interview - arguably seeking to justify a de facto division of Ukraine along military frontlines. On Wednesday, western officials said they would like to see Ukraine restored to the boundaries existing before 24 February - the start of the Russian invasion - 'as a minimum'. However, Ukraine is nowhere near being able to achieve such goals on the battlefield. A crucial period will come in the next month or so as the latest wave of western weapons, including US howitzers and German and British anti-aircraft systems, arrives. If that does not prove enough to change the military balance, the question will become how much more Britain and other Nato members are prepared to commit.", "b4e8fdf817577fd37d769bc488a0d6431161f6ba1007a7f20ca0a2b3": "The unavoidable truth looming over Europe's response to the invasion of Ukraine is that Russian gas heats the continent's homes and powers its industries. While European leaders have vowed to wean themselves off Kremlin-controlled supplies, both of gas and oil, the reality is that this is very hard to do in short order. There will be at least one more cold winter to come before major energy-hungry economies that rely heavily on Russia, such as Germany and Italy, can tap other sources. Knowing this, Vladimir Putin fired a shot across the bows this week. Having issued a decree that foreign buyers must start paying for their gas in roubles, he made Poland and Bulgaria the laboratory mice for the experiment. Both countries, the Kremlin announced, would no longer be receiving Russian gas through the Yamal pipeline from Siberia after they refused to accede to the demand. The decision could usher in a new phase of the war, with Russia making good on Putin's threat to use its vast gas reserves as a weapon against Europe. The two countries appear to have been chosen carefully. Poland gets about 45% of its natural gas from Russia, according to 2020 figures from Eurostat. That's not sky-high by European standards but Poland happens to be among the countries that have been most politically and militarily supportive of Ukraine. Bulgaria poses less of a threat to the Russian war effort but is more reliant on its gas, which accounts for about 73% of Bulgarian demand. Targeting these two countries allows Putin to test the power of his resource weapon on two different types of opponents - one that poses a genuine threat and another that looks more vulnerable and could serve as a salutary lesson to others in a similar position. Both have said they can and the facts appear to bear that out. Poland's contract with Gazprom is up at the end of the year anyway and it has been investing in alternative sources for some time. 'Poland is right next to Germany and can import from there,' said Tom Marzec-Manser, the lead European gas analyst at the energy consultancy ICIS. 'It has its own liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal and has a new pipeline coming indirectly from Norway online later this year. It has also built up storage, half-expecting that this might happen.' Bulgaria's situation is slightly less favourable but it does have a second pipeline connection to Greece coming on stream later this year. A Bulgarian entity recently booked an LNG cargo to arrive at a Greek port, one analyst told the Guardian. This could signal a plan to source supply from elsewhere. As Marzec-Manser points out, Putin has made it clear his threat to cut off gas supplies to 'unfriendly' countries, unless they pay in roubles, was not totally empty. 'There is proof it wasn't a bluff,' he said. The move means countries and companies that buy Russia's gas have a decision to make about whether they agree to pay in its currency. Hungary, which has proved a rare European friend to the Kremlin, has already said it will toe the Russian line. At least four private companies have agreed to the Kremlin's demands, according to Bloomberg. Latvia, which got 100% of its gas from Russia in 2020, has vowed along with Lithuania and Estonia to stop buying any. An LNG import terminal in Lithuania is a key alternative, particularly for these relatively small economies - the first in Europe to end Russian imports. The European Commission has said countries should not pay in roubles, and that complying with Russia's request could breach EU sanctions. However, under Russia's demands, payments would be made to Gazprombank in euros or dollars, before being converted. In theory, this would still breach sanctions. But last week the commission indicated contracts could be tweaked to make them compliant. This could be good news for major economies such as Italy and Germany. The latter gets 60% of its gas from Russia and has said it will take a while to reduce that to zero. A lot will depend on whether Russia escalates. The Dutch TTF price for gas delivery in May, a benchmark for Europe, began the week at EUR92 and touched EUR115 on Wednesday, a rise of 20%, in response to the Kremlin cutting off Poland and Bulgaria. The price settled back to EUR107 as of Wednesday afternoon, still 15% above the level at the start of the week. While UK energy suppliers buy on the British wholesale market, over time any rise in European prices will hit UK companies too, which could lead to higher prices for UK consumers. However, for a much greater shock wave to go through Europe, huge gas buyers such as Italy's Eni and Germany's Uniper would have to be cut off. That would have a huge impact on Russian revenues and it seems likely that some form of compromise on payments, like the EC has hinted at, is more likely.", "0eef30801417b9579c745530e508750f9db584579b866ca0f9a21ac2": "A key adviser to the premier of the most populous province in Solomon Islands has expressed concern that the China-Solomons security deal could enable the prime minister, Manasseh Sogavare, to use Chinese armed police and military personnel to quash democratic dissent and hold on to power for years to come. Celsus Irokwato Talifilu, who is an adviser to Daniel Suidani, the premier of Malaita province, said that while it was 'fair' that Australia, the US and other regional partners had focused their attention on the prospect of a military base on the islands, the major fear for many in Solomon Islands was the erosion of democracy. 'My main fear is [Chinese military or police personnel] put [Sogavare] in power for a long time,' he said. 'People say we are a democratic country, of course it is. But when you have a force bigger than anyone else in the Solomons, it will be easy for him to use that force to support him and his ministers or those who are in government to ensure they come back at the next elections.' The comments came as Australia's spy chief said Canberra was concerned Chinese police deployed to Solomon Islands under a new security pact could use 'ruthless' techniques previously used to quell anti-government protests in Hong Kong. 'In such a fragile, volatile country Chinese policing techniques and tactics that we've seen deployed so ruthlessly in Hong Kong, for example, are completely inconsistent with the Pacific way of resolving issues and could incite further instability and violence in the Solomon Islands,' said Andrew Shearer, the director general of the Office of National Intelligence, who travelled to the Pacific islands nation in March in a failed attempt to persuade Sogavare not to sign the agreement. The text of the security deal, which was signed last week, has been kept secret, with Sogavare saying he will only release it with China's permission, something that has alarmed Solomons MPs who have called for it to be made public. A leaked draft of the deal detailed broad conditions under which Solomon Islands could call upon China for armed police and military personnel, including 'to assist in maintaining social order, protecting people's lives and property, providing humanitarian assistance, carrying out disaster response, or providing assistance on other tasks agreed upon by the parties [to the agreement]'. Talifilu was speaking as he accompanied Suidani on a tour of Malaita, which is home to roughly a quarter of Solomon Islands' population. There are tensions between the national government and Malaita, which has serious economic challenges and does not feel it has received adequate support from the national government to address them. Malaita did not support the Sogavare government's decision in 2019 to switch diplomatic allegiance from Taiwan to China. Unhappiness with Sogavare over the switch was part of the motivation for riots in Honiara in 2021. Talifilu said that during the tour, many people across the province had raised the issue of the China security deal. 'People ask about it,' he said. 'And they are fearful to be honest ... It's a big discussion in communities, wanting to know how is this going to affect us.' Talifilu said the fears boiled down to two things: firstly that in the event of hostilities between the US and China, 'we will be caught in the conflict'. Secondly, the prime minister's ability to call on the Chinese for support to deal with internal security issues was seen as targeted at Malaita, given the historical tensions. 'It's known that Malaita province stood against China coming into our province ... so they know that the emphasis on security, internal security, is an emphasis against Malaita,' he said. 'So if it so happens that the Chinese are in Honiara or are invited to do things, it will be against Malaitans.' These concerns were echoed by the opposition leader Matthew Wale, who told the Guardian: 'I think the deal is targeted at Malaita and that's also the perception on Malaita. 'So that is a real threat to the unity of this country and certainly internal stability.' Talifilu said that it was understandable that foreign countries like Australia had focused on the prospect of a Chinese naval base being built on Solomon Islands. He warned that while Sogavare had repeatedly said there would be no Chinese military base, the assurances should not be trusted, as the prime minister had 'not been truthful' in the past, including in the lead-up to the change in diplomatic allegiance in 2019. 'He promised people, including foreign governments, before any switch that there would be thorough consultations and that includes reports from within government to inform the government of the pros and cons or the switch from Republic of China to PRC. He ended up not doing that. So those experiences for me have taught me that this man is the kind of person that you can't trust. 'It's fair to say that people should be worried. Why? Because why should we trust him now?' Sogavare, prime minister of Solomon Islands, was contacted for comment.", "47570a399986fd7538d2da314fcfe3fbd080284aa6d51070494bf1cb": "The UK government is set to announce a fourth delay to physical checks on fresh food imported from the EU amid industry reports that neither technology nor infrastructure resources were ready for the July start of the next phase of Brexit. The Brexit opportunities minister, Jacob Rees-Mogg, is expected to frame the move as use of the UK's newfound independent powers to control the trade border since the departure from the EU and the single market. He is also expected to say it is a response to supply chain fears in a trading environment already hit by the Ukraine war and cost of living crisis. The delays could push back the full implementation of Brexit controls until 2023, sources said, with physical checks removed and a potential relaxation on the requirement for import of products, animals, food and feed system (IPAFFS) paperwork. Earlier this month an outage in a key post-Brexit IT system, the Goods Vehicle Movement Service (GVMS), combined with the halting of P&O ferry routes, led to long delays for freight traffic trying to cross the Channel. Industry sources said small suppliers in the EU were not prepared for physical border checks or capable of getting the veterinary certificates that would be required on fresh food ranging from artisan cheese to olive oil and dried meats from countries such as Spain and Italy. 'EU suppliers are going to be hit in exactly the same way as British fish and food suppliers were last year. The difference here is that the UK has no way of helping the EU suppliers,' said one industry representative. Another said: 'This is good news as far as we are concerned. They have obviously had problems with GVMS in general and they don't want egg on their faces.' Sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) checks have been operational in all EU countries with which the UK shares a border, including France, Belgium and Ireland, since the Brexit withdrawal agreement was implemented on 1 January 2021. The cliff-edge approach left exporters of fish and other fresh food in chaos with a lack of customs agents and veterinary staff to certify whether the produce complied with EU standards. But in the UK post-Brexit checks on fresh food were not implemented for imports, being pushed back in 2020 and on two occasions in 2021. Under the current border plan, physical checks on meat were due to start on 1 July and on dairy on 1 September, with all remaining foods including fish and composite foods to be subject to checks from 1 November.", "2f1cc1b64064f11dbccd955b456144012f3d52bea908457632b48388": "", "2662d44aab50266dd3f2229f9132db266e2e96fa41ad17e9c33f7b8e": "Measles cases have surged nearly 80% worldwide this year amid disruption caused by Covid-19, the UN has said, warning that the rise of the 'canary in a coalmine' illness indicated that outbreaks of other diseases were likely to be on the way. The coronavirus pandemic has interrupted vaccination campaigns for non-Covid diseases around the world, creating a 'perfect storm' that could put millions of children's lives at risk, the UN's children's agency Unicef and the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a statement. Measles is a disease caused by a virus that attacks mainly children. The most serious complications include blindness, brain swelling, diarrhoea, and severe respiratory infections. Vaccination uptake of at least 95% is the best way to avoid it spreading, though many countries fall far short of that goal - Somalia is at just 46%, according to the UN data. Globally, more than 17,300 measles cases were reported in January and February, compared with about 9,600 during those months last year, according to new data from the UN agencies. There have been 21 large and disruptive measles outbreaks in the 12 months to April, most of them in Africa and the eastern Mediterranean, the data showed. Christopher Gregory, senior health adviser in Unicef's immunisation section, told Agence France-Presse that because measles was the 'most contagious vaccine-preventable disease' it often served as a warning sign. 'Measles is what we call the tracer, or the canary in the coalmine, that really shows us where those weaknesses in the immunisation system are,' he said. Yellow fever was among the diseases that could surge next, he said, after rising cases were reported in west Africa. 'We're particularly worried about those countries that are most fragile, where the healthcare systems are already really struggling, where they're still trying to deal with the impacts of Covid on top of these outbreaks,' he said. Somalia recorded by far the most measles cases in the past 12 months, with more than 9,000, the UN data showed, followed by Yemen, Afghanistan, Nigeria and Ethiopia - all countries experiencing some form of conflict. There are also fears that the war in Ukraine could spark a resurgence in the country after it recorded Europe's highest rate of measles between 2017 and 2019. Gregory said that it had been very difficult to keep track of any disease in Ukraine since the war began, adding that the biggest concern was 'what we could be missing'. The UN agencies said that 57 vaccination campaigns in 43 countries postponed at the start of the pandemic had still not been completed, affecting 203 million people - most of them children. Covid also continues to pile pressure on healthcare facilities and drag staffing and attention away from vaccination for longstanding deadly diseases. 'The impact of these disruptions to immunisation services will be felt for decades to come,' WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement. 'Now is the moment to get essential immunisation back on track and launch catch-up campaigns so that everybody can have access to these life-saving vaccines.' Gregory said it was time to put childhood immunisation on 'at least the same level of priority as finishing Covid vaccination'.", "6bae6f7e3e8ff97b26afc1222f11ddfc66f02d738669e6a4d4fc0871": "Pope Francis has urged Catholics to honour the elderly and take care of family bonds, also taking the opportunity to return to the thorny subject of mothers-in-law. Devoting his general audience in St Peter's Square on Wednesday to the relationship between generations, the Argentine pontiff made a long digression on the 'mythical character' of the mother-in-law and said they were often the victim of 'cliches'. He added: 'I'm not saying we see her as the devil, but she is always presented in a pejorative way. But the mother-in-law is the mother of your husband and the mother of your wife.' Equally, he urged daughters-in-law to take care of their relationships with their mothers-in-law. '... they gave birth to your spouse,' he said. 'At least make them happy.' The pope also had advice for mothers-in-law themselves. 'I tell you, be careful how you express yourselves,' he said. The 85-year-old pope added: 'We say to ourselves 'the further away your mother-in-law is, the better'. But no - she's a mother, she's an elderly person. One of the most beautiful things for a woman is to have grandchildren. When her children have children, it brings her to life again.' It is not his first foray on the subject. In 2015, Francis told a crowd of thousands in the US: 'Families quarrel and sometimes plates can fly and children bring headaches, and I won't speak about mother-in-laws.'", "8cf17815f9b427f7d9b95a4bc9dc6f3c709a77a8c35ee53f37e7944b": "Was you or were you having your tea, dinner or supper last night? Before it, were you feeling clammish, clemmed, starving, hungry, leary or just plain clempt? Are you still whanging in Yorkshire? Haining in Somerset? Hocksing in Cambridgeshire? Hoying in Durham? Pegging in Cheshire? Pelting in Northamptonshire? Yarking in Leicestershire? Or do you throw now? How do you pronounce scone? Researchers from the University of Leeds are interested in answers to all such questions as they embark on a heritage project to help explore and preserve England's dialects. Details have been announced of how the university plans to use its prized archive of English life and language that was gathered by Leeds University fieldworkers in the 1950s and 1960s. The results remain the most famous and complete survey of dialects in England. The university said it was making its extensive library of English dialects accessible to the public through the launch of The Great Big Dialect Hunt. It said researchers would be searching for 'new phrases and expressions to bring the archive into the 21st century and preserve today's language for future generations'. Fiona Douglas, from the university's department of English, who is leading the project, stressed they were not trying to repeat the scale of the original survey, in which fieldworkers went out to interview people over the age of 65 in more than 300 mostly rural communities. 'It was very, very big and there were many, many questions,' she said. The results, which include many photographs and audio, amount to a fabulously rich snapshot of how people in England lived and talked. If you want a regional map of what a cowhouse or freckles or chip pan scraps were called across England, they are in the archive. In the case of scraps, there are 50 variants from craps and cratchings to scratch and scratchings. Leeds researchers want to know whether some words are out of date. So do you give someone a piggyback or a pick-a-pack, cuddycaddy, callycode, colliebucky or backy? If you are from East Anglia, would you describe a lop-sided shelf as being 'slightly on the huh', and would you refer to more than two of something as a 'couple of three'? An interactive audio sound map of England allows people to hear how people talked in different areas when the survey was gathered. 'The recordings are just phenomenal because it is people talking about their lives and experiences, so it is a window on the past as well as you get to hear these fantastic voices,' said Douglas. She said the new project could better be described as a 'mini-survey' and, importantly, was not confined to older voices. 'We would like everybody to fill in our survey. It doesn't matter where you are from or how long you've lived there, or whether you think you've got a dialect or not.' The website will allow people to add their own voices and words to the archive. The university is partnering with five museums across England where people can physically go to add dialects. The project is funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, which gave PS530,500 to digitise the notebooks, photographs, word maps and audio recordings from the original fieldwork. 'We'd like to share what we've got but we're also interested in the dialects people have now because they are not something preserved in aspic,' said Douglas. 'It's not just something from the past.' The death of dialects has been predicted since the 18th century but Douglas said they were still here, thriving and evolving. Hearing someone with a strong twang was always a thrill, she said. 'It transports you. There is something absolutely visceral about it which makes you think: oh wow, I'm home, or these people are like me. 'A lot of it is about that sense of connectedness, a sense of belonging, a sense of rootedness, and even in our 24/7 global digitally overgrown world I think that really matters.'", "1c64e4381096f9dc193032c5dde2e80d218f2d05d2f57b52d82dc461": "", "3d7ce99876e2f75acf6cd25c21de1e60d38391581838e9ae0b91112a": "Off the west coast of Sicily lies the remains of the ancient city of Motya. There, a compound of temples and shrines offers a window into the life of Phoenician settlers who journeyed from Lebanon across the Mediterranean in the first millennium BC. While Motya has been studied for a century, the site is still giving up new secrets. Earlier this month a rectangular basin, long-believed to have served as an artificial harbour for protecting naval ships and participating in trade, was revealed to be something else entirely - a religious site, designed and constructed to perfectly align with the stars. The basin, larger than an Olympic-sized swimming pool, was rebuilt in 550BC along with Motya after it was destroyed in an attack by Carthage, another Phoenician colony across the sea in Tunisia. The city was then abandoned in Roman times.  Since the pool's discovery in the 1920s, it was thought to be a 'kothon' - an artificial military harbour. Kothon are quite common in the Mediterranean, says Ania Kotarba, a senior lecturer in archaeology at Flinders University. The most famous is in Carthage. But recent excavations and decades of research led by the archaeologist Lorenzo Nigro of Sapienza University of Rome and published in the journal Antiquity this month unearthed clues suggesting instead the pool is the heart of a sprawling religious site. 'Sacred pools are less common [than kothon],' Kotarba says. 'So one on such a scale is quite impressive.' Since his team's research, perceptions of the basin have 'drastically changed,' says Nigro in a statement. What was thought to be a harbour for centuries may soon be interpreted as 'a sacred pool at the centre of one of the largest cultic complexes of the pre-classical Mediterranean'. Reinvestigation of the basin began 12 years ago, when remains of a temple to the god Ba'al were discovered where excavators expected to find harbour buildings. Ba'al - a widely used Semitic word meaning 'lord' - has often been likened to the Greek god Orion, who was believed to exist as a constellation among the stars. Kotarba says Ba'al was associated with the god of storms in the Phoenician period. As Phoenicians were known to be seafarers, traders and explorers, their deities were associated with celestial bodies. 'Their livelihoods were connected to celestial movements around the sky,' she says. 'Storms are the greatest adversary to seafarers, and the god of storms could interrupt their safe passages. 'So it is not unexpected that their key sanctuary would be dedicated to Ba'al, and have something to do with astronomy working out movement of celestial bodies,' Kotarba says. A 10ft statue of Ba'al once stood at the pool's centre. Its torso was discovered in the 1930s in a nearby lagoon, and stone blocks used for its feet were found by the pool's edge.  Quoting Leonardo da Vinci, Nigro says; 'the only good mirror in antiquity is water. 'It became clear the function of the basin was to be a pool for watching the stars, reflecting them like a mirror,' he says. His research found the water's reflection was used as a tool to map movement of the stars for navigation - something crucial to Phoenicians, who Kotarba calls 'the greatest navigators of the Mediterranean and beyond'. Upon mapping the site, the research team also found the configuration of Motya itself aligned with the heavens.  Key features line up with constellations - the temple of Ba'al aligns with the rise of Orion's constellation at the winter solstice. Recent excavations also found several more temples bordering the pool, alongside inscribed stone columns, altars and offerings. Critically, unlike harbours, the pool is not connected to the sea. The draining of the kothon for excavation began in 2005. So, one morning when Nigro arrived to find a small pond of 'beautiful transparent water' in the basin, he 'could not understand how it was possible'. It was not until 2019 that excavation revealed channels carrying water to the pool from three natural springs. Nigro calls discovery of the Phoenician's 'pre-scientific tool' a 'piece of human-kind in the past'. 'We can not use our science to understand this past science,' Nigro told the Guardian. 'But it can teach us there exists a diversity in science. There could be solutions in it for us. The Phoenicians colonised, built up cultures and civilisations. They built roads and crossed seas, but they never destroyed their environment. 'We are the only civilisation destroying the environment,' he says. 'We should ask, are we the ones who have more science, or them?'", "69c5d70f853e090bf01ff46356518f57c850961b695a921078055d08": "", "0ddbc69b0655201f1e6c7aa42e3e0d6e08f4e7c5e1b811f3bbefa981": "", "ce18f3ff3f9b1b8f3efadf721bcd716636adb586feed7a31ea54ed10": "", "3ae3849da5461bfe678f4bce4d72df53358244aae6ddf961682166ab": "", "d138fca3758127b68a379cb9b9746e718c2bde93ab4aff0b29fad164": "", "f7b7db5f148d4cc5cc8ade961ad45b4d480310cdd94144f9c1c57bf9": "", "d75184ffa6614b38aec6101605c37ca663cf8ed0f8d9e552d6b2b74b": "", "2a08e2a64b019965daff9af2cd514f202a34d5e9eb5a9e4de6ac242e": "", "00130b814a10b7d90b551e3d18820c0f960478f5ac698310035f740d": "", "ba39909f8a31768ce64db28100f625039a83608071d052578961a2f3": "", "2e3dc6ce5cdeaa3aad6dc3ba4089fd797994e518efa722704046e167": "", "2caf059aef216d7763f470903aabdd00f7609600e07368756353611b": "When Mexican police found a pile of about 150 skulls in a cave near the Guatemalan border, they thought they were looking at a crime scene, and took the bones to the state capital.  It took a decade of tests and analysis to determine the skulls were from sacrificial victims killed between AD 900 and 1200, the National Institute of Anthropology and History said Wednesday. 'Believing they were looking at a crime scene, investigators collected the bones and started examining them in Tuxtla Gutierrez,' the state capital, the institute known as INAH, said in a statement. The police investigator's suspicions in 2012 were not unreasonable; the border area around the town of Frontera Comalapa in southern Chiapas state has long been plagued by violence and immigrant trafficking. And pre-Hispanic skull piles in Mexico usually show a hole bashed through each side of every skull, and were usually found in ceremonial plazas, not caves. But experts said Wednesday the victims in the cave had probably been ritually decapitated and the skulls put on display on a kind of trophy rack known as a 'tzompantli'. Spanish conquistadores wrote about seeing such racks in the 1520s, and some Spaniards' heads even wound up on them. While usually strung on wooden poles using holes bashed through them - the common practice among the Aztecs and other cultures - experts say the cave skulls may have rested atop poles, rather than being strung on them. Interestingly, there were more females than males among the victims, and none of them had any teeth. In light of the cave experience, archaeologist Javier Montes de Paz said people should probably call archaeologists, not police. 'When people find something that could be in an archaeological context, don't touch it and notify local authorities or directly the INAH,' he said.", "9a4c4e900135c06d9f354504bee4cbc131f08a192ec2567e61926f25": "An investigation has been launched by the government chief whip into reports that a Conservative frontbencher watched pornography on his phone in the Commons chamber. Female Tory MPs met Chris Heaton-Harris on Monday night to complain about sexism in parliament, with one alleging that a male colleague was watching pornography next to them in the House of Commons. The group of about 12 to 14 female MPs shared their experiences of sexist behaviour among Tory male MPs, telling Heaton-Harris that something must be done. They also called for action against three cabinet ministers who are reportedly subject to inquiries about inappropriate sexual behaviour. The MP who raised the issue did not name the male MP but there are reports that he was seen watching porn in both the chamber and a committee meeting. A spokesperson for the whips said: 'The chief whip is looking into this matter. This behaviour is wholly unacceptable and action will be taken.' It comes following an outcry about misogyny towards the Labour deputy leader, Angela Rayner, after the Mail on Sunday published claims from a Tory MP that accused her of crossing and uncrossing her legs, like the character played by Sharon Stone in the film Basic Instinct, to distract Boris Johnson at prime minister's questions. Rayner has hit out at the false claims. Johnson was pressed about whether the Tories were taking sexual harassment seriously by Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, who asked in PMQs on Wednesday whether this was grounds for dismissal. 'Of course sexual harassment is intolerable ... of course it's grounds for dismissal,' he said. Afterwards, the prime minister's press secretary said the Conservative party did not have a problem with misogyny and sexism. She said: 'You will have heard the PM address this explicitly in parliament today and over the last few days, saying there is absolutely no place for such behaviour and this cannot be tolerated in any workplace.' Asked whether watching pornography at work was a sackable offence, she said: 'I am not aware of the disciplinary action. Obviously, it is wholly unacceptable behaviour and it is being looked into.' At the meeting of a group known as 'the 2022', the female MPs demanded action against sexism in the Conservative party. Theresa May was present for part of the meeting.

However, a day after signing the agreement, which was published on the website of the US securities regulator, Musk responded to tweets from two political commentators that criticised Twitter staff. Musk replied on Tuesday night to a Twitter post from the podcast host Saagar Enjeti flagging an article claiming Twitter's legal head, Vijaya Gadde, had become 'emotional' during a meeting to discuss the deal. In the post, Enjeti referred to Gadde as Twitter's 'top censorship advocate', in a reference to the company's decision in 2020 to block sharing of a New York Post story about President Joe Biden's son Hunter. Musk replied: 'Suspending the Twitter account of a major news organisation for publishing a truthful story was obviously incredibly inappropriate.' His intervention triggered negative tweets from users about Gadde, including one quote tweet in response stating that she would 'go down in history as an appalling person', while other posts called for her to lose her job. Musk also replied to a potentially defamatory tweet from the rightwing commentator Mike Cernovich about Twitter's deputy general counsel, Jim Baker, which referred to Baker's work in a previous role at the FBI. Replying, Musk wrote: 'Sounds pretty bad ...' Former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo responded to Musk's comments on Twitter on Wednesday, calling out the CEO for bringing on 'harassment and threats' to Gadde. Costolo added: 'Bullying is not leadership'. Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal tweeted shortly after: 'I took this job to change Twitter for the better, course correct where we need to, and strengthen the service. Proud of our people who continue to do the work with focus and urgency despite the noise.' Twitter has been approached for comment. Eleazer Klein, a partner at US law firm Schulte Roth and Zabel, said Musk's tweets would not have come as a surprise to the company despite the agreement. He said: 'The fact that he would be vocal about his beliefs cannot come as a surprise to the company or be unanticipated. You would imagine that the company will be thoughtful about what is really an issue in this case for the deal moving forward.' The agreement also stated Musk would have to pay Twitter $1bn if he walks away from the deal. The break clause, a common feature of takeover agreements, would be triggered if the financing for the deal falls apart. Twitter will also have to pay a $1bn fee to the entrepreneur if, for instance, it accepts a higher bid from elsewhere. Musk has put together a $46.5bn funding package for the deal and his own contribution to it has concerned investors in Tesla, who wiped $126bn off the company's value on Tuesday amid worries that the billionaire may have to sell shares in the electric carmaker to fund his share. Musk is part-funding the Twitter deal with $21bn of his own equity and a further $12.5bn loan secured against his Tesla stake. The document filed with the US financial watchdog also addresses Musk's penchant for attention-grabbing tweets that are avidly consumed and retweeted by his 86 million followers.  The agreement states: 'The equity investor shall be permitted to issue tweets about the merger or the transactions contemplated hereby so long as such tweets do not disparage the company or any of its representatives.' According to the US dictionary publisher Merriam-Webster, the legal definition of disparagement is: 'the publication of false and injurious statements that are derogatory of another's property, business, or product'. Hours later, Musk tweeted that Truth Social, Donald Trump's rival social media platform, was outperforming Twitter and TikTok on the Apple store. Also on Wednesday, a US district judge denied Musk's request to scrap a settlement with the US securities and exchange commission (SEC) over 2018 tweets in which the CEO claimed he had funding to take Tesla private. That settlement required Musk's tweets regarding Tesla to be approved by a company attorney. The judge also denied a motion to nullify subpoenas in an investigation into whether Musk violated the settlement last November.", "a51e1ac2de00d8527b6dbd2564fc963230975505643662276ae2f468": "Prince Andrew has suffered another indignity after councillors in York unanimously voted to remove his honorary freedom of the city. An extraordinary meeting of York city council on Wednesday also heard councillors call on Andrew to relinquish his Duke of York title in the wake of his now settled sexual assault civil case. The freedom of York was granted to Andrew in 1987, essentially a wedding gift after his marriage the previous year to Sarah Ferguson. At the time there was a huge, joyful civic ceremony, which attracted crowds of more than 200,000 people. Thirty-five years later it has been ignominiously removed after a meeting at York racecourse which lasted barely 25 minutes. Darryl Smalley, the Liberal Democrat councillor who proposed the motion, said he was pleased to have won the support of councillors from all parties on the council. 'The honorary freedom of York is the highest honour we, as a city, can bestow on those who represent the very best of York,' Smalley said. 'The honour is held by many notable and accomplished people who carry it with pride and responsibly. 'Having been stripped of his military roles and royal patronages by the Queen, we believe that it is right to remove all links that Prince Andrew still has with our great city. 'The removal of this honorary title sends the right message that we as a city stand with victims of abuse. The next logical step is now for Prince Andrew to do the right thing and relinquish his Duke of York title. If he fails to do so, the government and Buckingham Palace must step in to remove his title to finally end Prince Andrew's connection to York.' Aisling Musson, a Labour councillor, said the council owed it to the people of York, 'particularly those who have been affected by sexual violence, abuse or human trafficking. Our first duty is not to our reputation but to their wellbeing and protection.' Apart from two abstentions from the lord mayor and the lord mayor elect, all councillors at the meeting voted for Andrew to be stripped of the title. Martin Rowley, a Conservative councillor, called for reassurance that in the future 'nobody receives a freedom of the city award as a result of right of birth, or standing in the community'. Andrew's freedom of York had been almost forgotten about until a former council official tipped off the Guardian, which prompted York city council staff to search the archives and in turn led to Wednesday's extraordinary meeting. In February it was announced that the prince had settled his case with Virginia Giuffre who had claimed she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein to have sex with Andrew when she was 17, a claim the prince has denied. The out-of-court settlement meant that Andrew made no admission of guilt. International lawyers said that the financial cost to Andrew was likely to be more than $10m (PS7m) even before he paid his own legal bill, which is expected to run into millions. The cost to his reputation has been huge. In February it was announced the Queen was stripping Andrew of his military affiliations and royal patronages. He also can no longer use the HRH royal style in any official capacity. He remains, however, the Duke of York - much to the chagrin of many in the city. Rachael Maskell, the MP for York Central, has said it was 'untenable for the Duke of York to cling on to his title another day longer'. A poll for the city's newspaper, the Press, showed that 88% of people agreed. An act of parliament would be needed for Andrew to be stripped of being the Duke of York, a title given to him by his mother in 1986 when he married Ferguson. Buckingham Palace and a spokesperson for the Duke of York declined to comment.", "d9cf28058ff0f1a6a383e38b5d3eb465f516343f6929e7a4924ae056": "Donald Trump is appealing the contempt of court order he received from a Manhattan judge that fines him $10,000 a day for failing to comply with a subpoena, according to documents filed Wednesday. The contempt order was issued in the civil investigation by New York state attorney Letitia James into the former president's business practices. On 7 April, James asked Judge Arthur Engoron to hold Trump in contempt of court for not turning over documents and information she had subpoenaed as part of the investigation. Trump had promised to comply 'in full' by 31 March, but did not, James said. Engoron granted James's request, fining him $10,000 a day. James' inquiry has been focused on whether the Trump Organization provided incorrect real estate valuation, to secure favorable loans as well as tax deductions. She recently stated that the office' had uncovered 'significant evidence' of wrongdoing. The top prosecutor's three-year investigation runs parallel to an inquiry by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, examining whether the Trump Organization engaged in questionable tax practices. Bragg's office has come under fire after the departures of high-profile prosecutors on this inquiry. He has insisted that the investigation continues. In a statement on the notice of appeal, James's office said that Trump's legal tactics would not thwart its inquiry. 'The judge's order was clear: Donald J Trump is in contempt of court and must pay $10,000 a day until he complies with our subpoenas. We've seen this playbook before, and it has never stopped our investigation of Mr Trump and his organization. This time is no different,' the office said. Trump's legal team did not immediately respond to a request for comment. His attorney, Alina Habba, has previously called James's inquiry 'political'.", "235bdfe194335fb68592161eedcf96531cfd15f75ccd7aa57e02342f": "Priti Patel's plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda is facing its first legal challenge after a charity instructed lawyers to demand the disclosure of documents because of fears the policy is contrary to international law. In a pre-action letter to the Home Office, which is expected to lead to a judicial review claim, the solicitors Leigh Day stated that the charity Freedom from Torture 'has serious concerns about the lawfulness of the policy'. It has requested 'disclosure of information regarding the policy', including documents outlining it, risk assessments and the memorandum of understanding signed by the UK and Rwandan governments. The legal action comes as the government's controversial Nationality and Borders Bill was finally passed by the Lords on Wednesday night and is poised to become law. The upper chamber rejected by 212 to 157 a last-ditch bid to ensure provisions in the legislation complied with the UK's international obligations towards refugees. There were cries of 'shame' from some peers as the result was announced. Under the Rwanda deal, signed off by Patel and praised by Boris Johnson as a way of saving hundreds of people from trafficking, those arriving by small boat across the Channel would be flown with a one-way ticket to Rwanda. Britain has promised Rwanda an initial PS120m as part of an 'economic transformation and integration fund' but the UK will be paying for operational costs too. However, no details have been released by the Home Office. The home secretary issued a rare ministerial direction to overrule concerns of civil servants about whether the scheme would deliver value for money. Separately, another legal challenge has been launched by the charities Detention Action and Care4Calais as well as the PCS union, whose members include Home Office staff and Border Force officers. A statement said a pre-action letter was sent on Monday initially challenging Patel's failure to disclose the criteria dictating which people seeking asylum will be transferred by force to east Africa and which will remain in the UK. They claim the removals to Rwanda would be unlawful as the policy penalises asylum seekers on the grounds of their irregular entry, in direct contravention of the Refugee Convention. Clare Moseley, Founder of Care4Calais, said: 'From the suspiciously sparse detail presented so far, it is already clear the plan holds multiple risks and innocent people will be needlessly and cruelly traumatised to score political points.' Patel has been the subject of significant judicial criticism for repeatedly failing to disclose key policy documents, including those relating to the confiscation of phones from newly arrived refugees and contentious plans to task Border Force to 'push back' boats carrying refugees across the Channel. Freedom from Torture, a London-based charity, was part of a successful challenge to stop the pushback of boats in the Channel. The government officially withdrew those plans on Sunday, just days before a judicial review of the tactic was due to be heard in the high court. A crowdfunding appeal will be launched by the charity to help raise funds to cover the costs of the legal challenge, which it hopes will lead to the Home Office policy being withdrawn. Sonya Sceats, the chief Executive at Freedom from Torture, said: 'The outpouring of compassion for those fleeing Ukraine and Afghanistan has shown that the public wants people seeking safety to be welcomed. But instead, this government is planning to ship refugees halfway around the world to Rwanda. We shouldn't have to resort to legal action for this government to treat refugees with basic human dignity - but here we are again. 'This cruel plan is not only deeply immoral and likely unlawful, it would also deny torture survivors and others access to vital trauma services like those provided by Freedom from Torture. Up and down the country, people are beginning to mobilise against this government's cynical efforts to stoke fear and xenophobia against refugees. This action is one part of a wider fight by the caring public to tell the government that this heartless policy is not in our name.' Fewer than 200 people who came to the UK without authorisation would have been sent to Rwanda last year, analysis of government figures found. The Refugee Council said 172 people could have been sent to the east African country had a deal been in place. It estimates that this year the number is not likely to be much higher. The figures cast doubt on Johnson's claim that 'tens of thousands' of people who have arrived in the UK without authorisation could be given a one-way ticket to Rwanda. A Home Office spokesperson said the agreement requires Rwanda to process claims in accordance with the UN Refugee Convention, ensuring protection from inhuman and degrading treatment. 'Our new migration and economic development partnership with Rwanda fully complies with all international and national law. Whilst we expect the partnership to be challenged in the court, we will defend any legal challenge robustly.'", "9d07500c3debd5fea1482fc8fb5801119efdbcad92ae6259967e7ce6": "An H3N8 strain of bird flu has been detected in humans for the first time, in China's central province of Henan.The four-year-old boy infected had been in contact with chickens and crows raised at his home, according to reports from China's National Health Commission.Avian influenza or bird flu as it is commonly known is a highly contagious viral disease with the first reports of human cases in the 1990s. Some strains of the bird flu, such as with H3N8 now, have been passed to humans but this is currently very rare, and usually occurs after very close contact with infected birds or animals.H3N8 viruses circulate widely in birds and in horses and have also been detected in dogs in North America.'We often see a virus spread to a human and then not spread any further so a single case is not a cause of great concern,' said Sir Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health, University of Oxford.'There is no reason to think it will go any further,' said Prof Paul Digard from the Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh, adding that Chinese authorities had not reported any illness in the immediate contacts of the infected boy.However, Horby and other disease experts said the widespread transmission and record number of outbreaks of avian flu in birds across the UK, US and Europe this year was a cause of concern as it increased the opportunity for avian viruses to mix and mutate and for human infection.'I do generally believe we need to be increasing influence surveillance globally quite concertedly right now. Apart from H3N8, we have seen a number of other new spillover events of influenza from poultry to people over recent years including H5N8 in Russia and H7N9 and H10N3 in China,' said Alexandra Phelan, assistant professor at the centre for global health science and security at Georgetown University.", "90a9f5517200ff92abb9978abc7367a851243628952f09721a72927e": "Russia and the US have carried out a dramatic prisoner exchange, trading a marine veteran jailed in Moscow for a convicted Russian drug trafficker serving a long prison sentence in America, a senior US official and the Russian foreign ministry said. The surprise deal would have been a notable diplomatic manoeuvre even in times of peace, but it was all the more extraordinary because it was completed as Russia's war with Ukraine has driven relations with the US to their lowest point in decades. Joe Biden welcomed the release of Trevor Reed, a former marine from Texas, but said the negotiations that resulted in the prisoner swap 'required difficult decisions that I do not take lightly'. Reed's 'safe return is a testament to the priority my Administration places on bringing home Americans held hostage and wrongfully detained abroad', Biden said in a statement. Reed was arrested in the summer of 2019 after Russian authorities said he assaulted an officer while being driven by police to a police station, after a night of heavy drinking. Reed was later sentenced to nine years in prison, though his family has maintained his innocence and the US government has described him as unjustly detained. The US agreed to return Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot serving a 20-year federal prison sentence in Connecticut for conspiracy to smuggle cocaine into the US after he was arrested in Liberia in 2010 and extradited to the US. Russia had sought his return for years while also rejecting entreaties by high-level US officials to release Reed, who was nearing his 1,000th day in custody and whose health had recently been worsening, according to his family. A senior US official described Reed's case as one of 'utmost priority' for the Biden administration, for reasons that included his health. The official noted that Yaroshenko, whose sentence has now been commuted, had already served the majority of his sentence. The Russian foreign ministry said the exchange of Reed and Yaroshenko was 'a result of a long negotiation process'. Though officials would not say where the transfer took place, in the hours before it happened commercial flight trackers identified a plane belonging to Russia's federal security service flying to Ankara, the Turkish capital. The US Bureau of Prisons also updated its website overnight to reflect that Yaroshenko was no longer in custody. Reed was en route back to the US, traveling with Roger Cartsens, the government's special presidential envoy for hostage affairs. The prisoner swap marks the highest-profile release during the Biden administration of an American deemed wrongly detained abroad and comes even as families of detainees who have met over the last year with administration officials had described them as cool to the idea of an exchange. In a statement, the Reed family thanked Biden 'for making the decision to bring Trevor home' as well as other administration officials and Bill Richardson, the former US ambassador to the United Nations whom the family said traveled to Moscow in the hours before the Ukraine war began in hopes of securing Reed's release. Reed was one of several Americans known to be held by Russia, including WNBA star Brittney Griner, who was detained in February after authorities said a search of her bag revealed a cannabis derivative, and Michigan corporate security executive Paul Whelan, who is being held on espionage-related charges his family says are bogus. It was unclear what if any impact Wednesday's action might have on their cases. Reed's parents scored a rare private meeting with Biden and administration officials last month. They had stood weeks earlier along his motorcade route during a presidential visit to Texas in hopes of attracting his attention, then later demonstrated outside the White House to ask for a meeting.", "454b1f0571f1213bd9dfe6fb1f6951170a79a10f874b9a38384f7561": "The remains of a huge sea creature with enormous teeth that could have helped it capture giant squid have been found in the Swiss Alps. Ichthyosaurs were large marine reptiles with an elongated, snakey shape. They first emerged after the end of the Permian extinction, an event also known as the 'great dying', which occurred about 250m years ago and which wiped out more than two-thirds of species on land and 96% of marine species. The toothy beast is one of three giant ichthyosaurs discovered in the Swiss Alps and is thought to have lived during the late Triassic period, about 205m years ago - potentially making them some of the last such behemoths.  The team said the findings helped resolve the conundrum of whether giant ichthyosaurs, like some smaller species of the creatures, had teeth. Prof Martin Sander, of the University of Bonn, a co-author of the study, said: 'It's all very, very scanty evidence. We have these ghosts swimming in the late Triassic oceans for tens of millions of years, and we don't know what they look like. It's an embarrassment for palaeontology. 'For a while we thought they had teeth. Then we thought, well, we never find any teeth. Now we have the tooth of a giant and a giant tooth. So some of them have teeth.' Writing in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology the team describe how they discovered fossils from three giant ichthyosaurs at different sites in the Kossen Formation between 1976 and 1990. A fossil from one of the beasts was an incomplete tooth 10cm in length. The team found an enormous vertebra and rib fragments relating to another. The fossils of the third included seven large vertebrae. Sander said none of the remains appeared to be of known species of ichthyosaur. The team say the tooth, which lacks most of its crown, is only the second to have come from a giant ichthyosaur and is the largest ever found for such a creature, surpassing those of a species known as Himalayasaurus, which was discovered in China and is thought to have had a body length of about 15 metres. 'Ichthyosaurs have a very characteristic tooth structure that's visible in the root and also in the crown,' said Sander, adding that the toothy giant discovered in the Alps probably would have eaten smaller ichthyosaurs and giant squid.  Sander said one of the creatures appeared to have been about the same size as Himalayasaurus, while the other two, including the toothy beast, were probably similar in size to the giant ichthyosaur Shastasaurus, a creature found previously in British Columbia and that was about 21 metres long - around two doubledecker bus lengths. 'That skeleton had vertebrae that are the same diameter as the ones from the Alps,' said Sander. But they are not the largest ichthyosaurs known to have lived. Among other finds, a toothless jawbone discovered in the Bristol channel is thought to have belonged to an ichthyosaur that was about 26 metres long.  While ichthyosaurs roamed around the oceans, the newly reported remains were laid down in what was once a lagoon, suggesting the beasts went into shallow waters. 'It's kind of the same problem when you get a sperm whale in the North Sea,' said Sander. Dr Ben Moon, a palaeontologist at the University of Bristol who was not involved in the work, said it was possible the creatures might have entered shallow waters to mate or give birth. He said the new report was exciting as there were few fossils of giant ichthyosaurs. Dr Nick Fraser, a palaeontologist at National Museums Scotland, said it was difficult to determine the size of a giant ichthyosaur based on a tooth alonebut that the finds shed new light on the reptiles. 'Until now we have suspected that most of the largest ichthyosaurs were toothless and were suction feeders,' he said, adding that the size of the newly reported tooth was stunning. 'The owner of this tooth was not to be messed with,' said Fraser. 'Along with remains of vertebrae and ribs, here is really concrete evidence that, in the past, Triassic waters sheltered some truly massive ocean-going reptiles, possibly as large as the living blue whale, and some likely had huge jaws armed with robust teeth.'", "69f96e6e32b90d3aedf2c8845c629522807aacb4bb451bafa5bb0dab": "", "3a71b9885677c1bd5ed4e38fa4fa9aaade7fdc7ea7a7f1944d3d7dd1": "", "58ce0507035a33095d5ac90b1d8e5ee216c1d88d59a8576309ca0bbe": "", "22d939ce26f03ad731a3dc0923bb26f4bf3416a6fca7b1c59d6a921d": "", "bfdeddc65f799ed6865eed5b3e09ff15454faf574c256b9ce7fa9170": "", "99244cb029a638159da33493d34f501f32ace5ac68037fc95cd5f867": "", "090b33d6806e09ee3a9bf5d93586b173707340b39e8e8f876df3251c": "There is a crime wave on our streets, being committed by insouciant teens, commuting executives and even pensioners. Gleefully they glide across our inner cities, scarcely breaking a sweat as they overtake cyclists on stiff climbs. They descend with ease, hair whipping in the wind, gravity and electric engine working together to deliver them to their destination at sometimes staggering speeds. There are hundreds of thousands of these lawbreakers in the country today. They flout the law openly. You will have seen them in cycle lanes, main roads and even on the pavements. Perhaps you've almost been knocked over by one yourself. London, Hampshire, the West Midlands and Sussex appear to be particular hotspots. They're the e-scooter riders of the UK, and they have already come to a street near you. Despite it being illegal to ride a private e-scooter anywhere in the UK that is not private land, use has soared in recent years, with 1m private e-scooters imported into the UK since 2018, and about 750,000 believed to be in use. 'The illegal e-scooters are demonstrating a clear unmet transport need,' says Lorna Stevenson, an e-scooter researcher at the University of Westminster. 'There are people using them who won't know they're illegal, but others who do, and still see it as worth the risk. The question is, what is the rest of the transport system not providing to these people?' Most private e-scooters are set to a limit of 30km/h (19mph), although some can go up to 60km/h. Cheaper models will set you back less than PS100, although if you want to travel more than a couple of miles, you are looking at more like PS300 or PS400. They are sold by major retailers including Argos and Currys, with disclaimers against illegal use that are routinely ignored. 'Pretty much everyone agrees,' says Lorna Stevenson, 'that the current situation is bad. The fact that it's legal to walk into a shop and buy an e-scooter, but not to ride it on the road, is a mess for all concerned.' 'I feel like there's nothing wrong with e-scooters if they're using them safely,' says Al, 35, a marketer and private e-scooter user from south-east London. Al bought his PS270 e-scooter in December 2021. He is immunocompromised, and has spent much of the past two years shielding. With his e-scooter, he's able to travel across the city without fear of maskless commuters. (He says that he's unable to ride a bike, for medical reasons.) He insists that he's a responsible user, only using it in cycle lanes, never pavements, and avoiding rush-hour traffic, so as not to clog up the roads. 'I hate it when I see people whizzing through buses,' Al says. 'It's like: 'You're making all of us look bad.' I know it's exciting and fun, but calm down.'' But Al has already fallen foul of the law: in March this year, British Transport Police confiscated the scooter. 'I was right in front of my house,' Al sighs. He had to pay PS160 to get it back from an impound lot, and then fix it, because it had been damaged in transit. Al is Black; research from the zero-carbon campaign group Possible in 2021 found that Black Londoners are more than three times more likely to be stopped for e-scooters offences than white Londoners. Despite his brush with the law, Al intends to keep using his e-scooter. 'I need it,' he says. 'I'm sorry if it's against the law.' There are legal ways to experience the e-scooter thrill. Since 2020, rental e-scooter trials have been operational in many parts of the UK, run by companies including Lime, Spin, Dott, Tier and Voi, in partnership with local authorities. These devices are capped at a maximum speed of 15.5mph, and users must have a full or provisional driving licence. Helmet-wearing is strongly advised, although not mandatory. The Department for Transport is monitoring these trials, which have been extended to later this year, and will use the data collected to determine whether e-scooters should be legalised. I try one of these rental schemes for myself on the streets of Southwark, south London. Downloading the Lime app and scanning my ID is straightforward: the app takes me through a lighthearted quiz (should I wear helmets only on bad hair days, or all the time?) before I'm able to unlock the e-scooter and move it from the stand. It's cumbersome and fairly heavy to wheel, and it takes me a minute to get the hang of it - you need to kick away and freewheel before you can start the engine. Gathering speed, I look from side to side and then, quietly as I can, I mutter: 'Vroom. Vroom vroom.' It's fun. After my brief jaunt, I'm a fan. Were e-scooters available in my area of London (they aren't currently), I could certainly see myself using one to get around. I'm not alone: canvassing e-scooter users participating in trials around the UK for this article, many are evangelical about their promise. 'They're incredibly easy to use,' says Joe Rayment, a 30-year-old bid writer. 'You just push off and hold a button and you're away.' Rayment lives in Bristol, which is hilly. 'I'm not super-fit,' he admits, 'so cycling is difficult. But on an e-scooter you can whip up a hill really easily.' Rayment uses rental e-scooters to replace journeys that he would previously have taken by car. 'If I'm going out for an evening,' he says, 'to visit a friend on the other side of the city, whereas I might have got a cab both ways before, I'll get a scooter there and back now.' This is arguably the great promise of e-scooters and other electric micro-mobility devices, such as e-bikes: that they can replace fossil-fuel-powered models of transportation. 'This is an exciting mode of transport that has the ability to get people out of cars,' says Hal Stevenson of Lime, 'where previously bikes weren't so attractive.' The key issue is what forms of transport the e-scooters are replacing. If e-scooters are pulling people out of cars, they're more sustainable, but if people are using e-scooters for journeys they might have walked, or cycled, they're a net loss, because manufacturing e-scooters is a resource-intensive endeavour. 'We need to move away from fossil fuels,' says John Broderick of the Royal Society of Chemistry. 'All types of electric vehicles are more efficient than combustion engines. But it requires a lot of material resources to make the lithium-ion batteries. Plus, there's no infrastructure in place in the UK to effectively recycle them, meaning that some scooter batteries may go to landfill.' Lime estimates that, globally, one in four trips taken by its users replaces a car journey. A Swiss research paper, published in December, found that privately owned e-scooters tended to replace car journeys, but rented e-scooters emitted more CO2 than the transport modes they replaced. 'They're not a silver bullet,' admits Hal Stevenson. 'But they are a tool to help get people out of cars, and create more sustainable transport solutions.' It all comes down to best usage, says Broderick. 'If they're being bought as toys, and people aren't getting a lot of mileage out of them, then they'll have a high profile in terms of their environmental impact,' he says. 'But if you're using them for five or six years and they're replacing a car, that's great.' Sustainability is probably a secondary consideration for many e-scooter users. More than anything, e-scooters are great fun, as I learned for myself on the streets of Southwark. 'It's a good laugh riding them,' says Jonathan Thompson, a 52-year-old healthcare worker from Middlesbrough, who is a regular rental e-scooter user. 'When you get on a straight stretch there's this nice flying feeling.' But for all their acolytes, it is almost as easy to find detractors. In part, this is because reckless users are so visible. 'They're always on the pavement,' says Pritpal Kaur, a 71-year-old airport worker from west London. 'They don't seem to care. They think they own the pavement.' Kaur was almost knocked down by an e-scooter on the pavement - at the last minute, her daughter pulled her out of the way. Like Kaur, I've also almost been hit by an e-scooter on the pavement. The rider, a teenager, came so close, I felt a rush of air as he swerved around me. But it seems unfair to vilify all e-scooter riders due to the rule-breaking of a few: after all, 56% of car drivers exceed the speed limit in low-speed areas. I suspect this hatred is fuelled by a larger animus among motor vehicle users towards people they perceive to be clogging up the roads. 'Some people really don't like e-scooters, in the same way that some people don't like cyclists,' says Lorna Stevenson. 'They are perceived to be 'other', or doing something that is not normal. Why won't they just get a car? But others have valid reasons for not liking them.' For people with disabilities, particularly the visually impaired, e-scooters, which are mostly silent, can affect their ability to use public spaces. It is for this reason that Guide Dogs UK has spoken out against legalising e-scooters, while the Royal National Institute of Blind People has called for a range of measures including safe parking, road use only and enforcement against pavement users. Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Salford are developing a universal sound for e-scooters. (The Lime e-scooter I used made a low-pitched whirr, but the private e-scooters that zipped past me were noiseless.) 'They come up behind you and you can't hear them,' says Elaine Maries, who is 54 and lives in Milton Keynes. Maries, who is visually impaired, has been knocked over twice by e-scooters. The first time, in May 2021, happened just as Maries and her guide dog, Inca, stepped outside their house. 'Two young people hit me and I fell over on Inca,' Maries says. A passerby told Maries they were e-scooter users, who fled the scene. Maries was bruised, and Inca pulled a muscle in her leg that put her out of action for six weeks, rendering Maries housebound. Two months later, Maries tripped over two e-scooters on a pavement and fractured her foot. 'What people don't realise,' says Maries, 'is when something like this happens, that's my complete independence gone.' Maries was unlucky. You are much more likely to be injured by a car than an e-scooter. In the year to June 2021, there were 882 accidents involving e-scooters, and three deaths, but all of these deaths were of e-scooter users, rather than pedestrians. The first e-scooter death reported on UK roads was of the YouTuber and TV presenter Emily Hartridge, who died after colliding with a lorry in July 2019. An inquest concluded that Hartridge had lost control of the scooter in part due to an underinflated tyre. In January this year, a 74-year-old male e-scooter rider died, while in March, a 14-year-old girl riding an e-scooter died after a crash involving a van. These deaths attracted national media attention due to the novelty of e-scooters, but it's worth putting them into context: about four people die each day on our roads, and these deaths pass largely unnoticed, while newspapers fulminate about the 'e-scooter menace' on our streets. 'Our feelings of safety are not always rational,' says Lorna Stevenson. 'There are people out there with strongly negative feelings about e-scooters, and it's important we don't minimise those concerns, especially when those people may already be transport-disadvantaged due to age or disability.' But there is some evidence to suggest that e-scooters may be more dangerous than comparable forms of transport, such as bicycles. One factor is their speed. 'My concern is how easily they can be tampered with,' says Margaret Winchcomb of the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety, which recently published a report into e-scooter safety. 'The scooters may be sold with a capped speed, but we've heard these designs can be altered to go up to speeds of 60mph.' By contrast, professional cyclists struggle to achieve speeds of more than 30mph, and the average urban cyclist rides well below 20mph. 'It's basic physics,' says Winchcomb. 'The faster you're going when you hit a solid object, the more energy is released. Fundamentally, our bodies can't cope with that.' The design of e-scooters may also make them unstable. 'Because they have smaller wheels,' says Winchcomb, 'they are more susceptible to defects in the road surfaces. They can't navigate potholes so easily.' A study from University of California researchers in April found that e-scooters had injury rates more akin to motorcycles than bicycles. I'm not surprised to find this: although my Lime e-scooter was capped at a speed of 12.5mph - which is by no means fast, so that I was easily overtaken by cyclists - when I hit a pothole, I nearly fell off. The e-scooter felt much less stable than any bike I've ridden. To mitigate against injury, helmet-wearing is strongly encouraged by the major rental companies: Lime gives users a discount if they upload a selfie of themselves wearing a helmet before a ride. In the Netherlands, traditional e-scooters are illegal; larger, sturdier devices that resemble conventional bicycles, but are used in a standing position, are commonly used. Despite these concerns, it seems near-inevitable that e-scooters will be legalised in the near future: they are already legal in many European countries. In October 2020, the House of Commons Transport Committee recommended that the Department for Transport should legalise private e-scooters, subject to stricter enforcement against pavement use and pavement clutter, and with speed limits. Most experts, Lorna Stevenson included, would welcome such a move. 'We need to have a grownup conversation about the fact that we need to drastically reduce our carbon emissions from transport,' she says. 'If it's not e-scooters and e-bikes, then what is it?' Al is likewise convinced that his days of being stopped by police for riding his scooter will soon be at an end. 'I know it will be legalised,' he insists. 'And then we'll have freedom.' Some names have been changed.", "ac6ff564538736d3027903e1303a7ee9d51a3bcd7eea1b8faffeaca4": "", "f47fa01092d8f1cf933ba0c9ac3b8e818f760c9b9e1a6eba322c8f5c": "", "e36c6a2f3823c9d05dc12a42e4c8a3ec52bb2d4a3846c7d9bb514149": "Labourers at the one of the world's largest egg factories arrived at the plant in Rembrandt, Iowa, early one morning in March to discover they were about to work themselves out of a job. As they gathered at the huge barns housing stacks of caged hens, the workers were told to forget about their usual routine of collecting eggs and feeding the birds. Overnight, the factory had begun slaughtering more than 5 million chickens using a gruesome killing method after detecting a single case of avian influenza. Even supervisors were assigned to the arduous task of dragging dead hens out of packed cages as Rembrandt Enterprises raced to contain the spread of the virus, amid the largest bird flu outbreak in the US in seven years. The culling has been repeated at chicken and turkey farms across Iowa and 28 other states from Maine to Utah. More than 22m birds have been killed in an attempt to contain the outbreak - the majority in Iowa, the US's biggest producer of eggs. The slaughter of 5.3m hens at Rembrandt is the largest culling at any factory farm in the country. Workers spent nearly a month pulling the dead poultry from the cages and dumping them in carts before they were piled high in nearby fields and buried in huge pits. The killing over, about 250 people were summarily thrown out of work with just a few dozen skeleton staff remaining. In the weeks that followed, animal rights protesters targeted Rembrandt's billionaire owner, Glen Taylor, over the cull, including disrupting games played by the professional basketball team he owns, the Minnesota Timberwolves. But few voices have been raised in support of Rembrandt's workers, some of them undocumented migrants. Others fired from the plant contrast the seriousness with which the bird flu outbreak has been taken by Rembrandt's management to what they describe as the company's lax approach to the threat to workers from Covid, as it swept through factory farms and slaughterhouses in Iowa and elsewhere. 'Right now everybody's worried about the chickens,' said Oscar Garcia, a former supervisor at the plant. 'We get it: it was really inhumane the way they killed them. But chickens are chickens, right? People worked in those barns pulling out dead birds in terrible conditions, faeces everywhere, doing 12- or 14-hour days. 'They couldn't protest because then they'd be fired and lose their redundancy pay. Then they're thrown out of work and no one speaks for them.' Outside criticism of Rembrandt has focused on the method of killing. Chicken farms have previously slaughtered hens en masse by suffocating them with foam or pumping barns full of carbon dioxide, methods that have been criticized as inhumane. But Tom Cullen of the Iowa newspaper the Storm Lake Times revealed that birds at Rembrandt were culled using a system known as ventilation shutdown plus (VSD+) in which air is closed off to the barns and heat pumped in until the temperature rises above 104F (40C). 'They cooked those birds alive,' said one of the Rembrandt workers involved in the culling. An animal rights group, Animal Outlook, used freedom of information laws to obtain records of experiments at North Carolina State University that show that VSD+ causes 'extreme suffering' to the hens as they 'writhe, gasp, pant, stagger and even throw themselves against the walls of their confinement in a desperate attempt to escape'. 'Eventually the birds collapse and, finally, die from heat and suffocation,' the group said. Members of another group, Direct Action Everywhere, have disrupted Timberwolves games in recent weeks wearing T-shirts proclaiming 'Glen Taylor Roasts Animals Alive'. James Roth, director of the Center for Food Security and Public Health at Iowa state university's college of veterinary medicine and an adviser to the federal government on biosecurity, acknowledged that VSD+ causes more suffering than other forms of culling, but said it is the most efficient means of containing the spread of bird flu because it is relatively swift. 'Nobody wants to see it used, but sometimes it is, as a last resort. The rationale is if the influenza virus spreads so fast that it'll go through a poultry house really rapidly, all of those birds produce massive amounts of virus in the air. Then you have a big plume of virus coming from that house that spreads to other poultry houses. It's critical to get the birds euthanised before that virus becomes a huge plume of virus to spread,' he said. Roth said that the authorities appear to have learned important lessons from 2015, when a bird flu outbreak resulted in what the US agriculture department calls 'the largest poultry health disaster in US history', with the slaughter of about 50 million chickens and turkeys. This time federal regulators moved quickly to contain the outbreak by shutting down the movement of workers between poultry flocks, a significant cause of the spread of avian flu in 2015. But Roth said this year the virus appears to have arrived in the US carried by waterfowl from Europe and to be better adapted to be spread by wild birds, which are harder to contain. That prompted the USDA to press for a swift culling at infected poultry farms. On 17 March, Rembrandt notified its supervisors that avian flu had been detected on the site. 'They sent out email at 10.30pm letting us know they had a confirmed case,' said a former Rembrandt worker who was obliged to sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to receive redundancy payments. When the worker arrived the next day he discovered the company had already begun slaughtering millions of chickens. 'Once they're dead, we had to take them out by hand one by one, put them in a wheelbarrow. That's really intense manual labour. They are not very big cages. Twelve chickens are crammed in there. Awful conditions,' he said. 'After it was over, we were told to attend a meeting. We walked in. There was a big stack of yellow envelopes. That's like showing a knife to a chicken. You know what's going to happen next. We worked ourselves out of a job. I saw people who had years and years of experience just being let go. It was totally unexpected.' Some workers thought the layoff might be temporary, as it was during the 2015 outbreak. But they were given redundancy payments and told to find other jobs, suggesting the move was permanent and raising questions about the future of the plant. Some of the skilled former workers have had little trouble finding another job. Others have struggled. 'I'm just rushing to find a job in order to support my family,' said a former Rembrandt employee with several years at the company. Those struggling include undocumented workers who, Garcia said, were hired indirectly through third-party contractors. In February, the Storm Lake Times reported that a lawsuit by the family of a Guatemalan migrant worker who was crushed to death when cages collapsed on him revealed that he had been working under a false name through a subcontractor. Garcia also contrasted the seriousness with which Rembrandt took bird flu to the company's handling of Covid-19 as it surged in Iowa, particularly among labourers working close together on factory farms and in slaughterhouses. He said Rembrandt appeared to care more about avian flu outbreaks than Covid. He criticised the management for failing to require workers to wear a mask or to be vaccinated. 'They actually liked the fact that we didn't require our employees to get vaccinated, because they were hoping we would get employees from the surrounding areas that were requiring their employees to get vaccinated. They're using it almost as a recruitment tool,' he said. Other workers said that when they contracted Covid, they were obliged to use the days off they had earned as holidays instead of being given sick days. 'It's a company that makes millions of dollars. I guess I shouldn't be surprised that it doesn't care about people,' said Garcia. Rembrandt Enterprises has been approached for comment.", "bd90d5d99dd1b71deb62014c6d1c02b11cf6e5a93893227648914bdc": "In 2019, the Atlantic ran an opinion piece titled 'The struggle for gay rights is over'. Written by the rightwing academic James Kirchick, the piece was obviously meant as a provocation, but its argument that 'for those born into a form of adversity, sometimes the hardest thing to do is admitting that they've won' was at least considered cogent enough at the time to publish. It came towards the end of a slew of political victories for the LGBTQ+ cause. At that time, it seemed as though the US supreme court would hand down a landmark ruling immediately before Pride Weekend every couple of years. The demise of the homophobic Defense of Marriage Act in 2013 was followed by the end of the federal ban on marriage equality in 2015. Widespread acceptance of same-sex marriage rights, gay people serving in the military and the need for protections for LGBTQ+ people followed. As recently as 2020, the court, then with two Trump appointees, ruled that the 1964 Civil Rights Act protected gay, lesbian and transgender workers. For all the terrible crises of our century, LGBTQ+ people's rights were solidly enshrined, and attitudes were shifting in line with legislation. In 1985, 89% of parents said they would be sad if they discovered their child was gay or a lesbian. By 2015, it was down to 39%. Yet in the past few months, those victories have come under threat as the US has witnessed a pronounced acceleration of anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric and legislation, fueled chiefly by misinformation about what it means to be trans and hysteria over so-called grooming. A rash of laws concerning the teaching of human sexuality in school curricula, banning trans student athletes and stripping parents of the right to help their gender-variant children obtain appropriate care have popped up in numerous red states this year. As same-sex marriage is now part of the fabric of America, conservatives have chosen to exploit Americans' unfamiliarity with trans people and piggyback on parental anger over the perceived overreach of Covid-era school closures, conflating it with an insidious sense of 'wokeness', in the hopes of finding an electorally viable sluiceway for anti-LGBTQ+ hysteria. The most famous of these anti-LGBTQ+ laws is the piece of Florida legislation banning instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity in schools between kindergarten and third grade, the so-called 'don't say gay' law. 'A state hasn't passed a law like this in more than 20 years,' said Shannon Minter, the legal director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR) and a trans man. 'Like many other people, I thought there was no way they would, because it's so draconian and obviously unconstitutional.' Laying groundwork for a potential 2024 presidential campaign, Florida's Trump-like governor, Ron DeSantis, has positioned the state as the last stronghold of liberty in America. The governor and his supporters have labeled as a 'groomer' anyone who believes children can learn LGBTQ+ people exist, arguing that simply by talking about gay relationships to a child, you are sexualizing that child. DeSantis' press secretary, Christina Pushaw, for example tweeted: 'If you're against the Anti-Grooming bill, you are probably a groomer or at least you don't denounce the grooming of 4-8 year old children.' To be gay, in their view, is to be inherently sexualized, a threat to innocence in a way that straight Americans are not. Such vehemence has caught even veteran LGBTQ+ advocates by surprise. 'At first, it was like 2015 again, with the bathroom bills, and I thought, 'There'll be a little pressure from national orgs and it'll stop,' but it didn't,' says Ada-Rhodes Short, a roboticist and trans rights activist. 'It started escalating and escalating.' For her, the catalyst was when Texas Republicans such as Greg Abbott and Ken Paxton, the governor and attorney general, not only banned gender-affirming medical care for trans youth but reframed their parents as child abusers, Paxton signing a 13-page legal opinion that parents or doctors who helped children transition were abusers who should be investigated by law enforcement. He was followed by Arizona's governor, Doug Ducey, who, after barring minors from gender-affirmation treatment, wouldn't even state for the record that trans people were real. Politicians are supported in the media by commentators like Tucker Carlson, who claimed 'no one had heard of this trans thing four years ago', or Charlie Kirk, channeling 1980s fears in saying 'gays want to corrupt your children'. Newly rejuvenated, the right wing is poised to make transphobia and homophobia cornerstones of the midterms and 2024 elections, with promises to deliver 'don't say gay' legislation in states including Michigan and New York. Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, a conservative lobbying group, inveighed against the governors of Indiana and Utah for vetoing legislation banning trans women from participating in sports, calling the bills 'timely, mainstream protections'. The Republican US representative Marjorie Taylor Greene vowed to introduce a federal 'don't say gay' bill if Republicans win the House this November, only to one-up herself days later by tweeting that for people to be pro-trans is to be pro-pedophilia. The dynamic is one of perpetual ratcheting-up. What began in Florida could spread nearly everywhere. Convinced that 'there's a culture shift happening and we need to be focused on survival', Rhodes-Short and a dozen others co-founded Tear It Up. Modeled on Act Up, the organization that staged die-ins and other aggressive tactics to draw attention to the lack of funding for HIV/Aids, it is simultaneously confrontational and focused on mutual aid. 'While we are under a huge attack, we can see what's coming in November and the spring and we need to prepare for the next fight. People are running on insane nonsense, like trans people should face a firing squad,' says Rhodes-Short, referring to to Robert Foster, a former Mississippi lawmaker and gubernatorial candidate who said that anyone 'advocating to put men pretending to be women in locker rooms and bathrooms with young women should receive the death penalty by firing squad'. Republican-dominated state legislatures have even begun bringing back North Carolina-style 'bathroom bills' mandating that people use the facilities that correspond with the sex they were assigned at birth. 'That started to supercharge this issue,' says Alejandra Caraballo, an attorney and instructor at Harvard University's Cyberlaw Clinic. 'That's what DeSantis ran with. It's the new tactic du jour. You saw Tucker Carlson saying that Disney supports the chemical castration and sexual grooming of children - stuff you would have heard two years ago and thought it was off the wall. Now it's going to an audience of 4 million.' The business-friendly wing of the GOP that would quietly team up with Democrats to scuttle rabidly homophobic bills is now outnumbered, and legislators in a dozen or more states that lean even farther to the right than DeSantis are taking note. Minter, the National Center for Lesbian Rights legal director, believes Florida is the test case for a renewed push for an aggressive, Christian-nationalist program. 'That's why it's important that Disney has dramatically stepped up,' Minter says, referring to its initially uneven but increasingly vocal opposition to Florida's new law. 'The GOP is in an internal battle between the moderate, center-right legislators who have historically controlled the party and a very extreme Trumpian right wing that poses a threat not just to the Republican party but to our democracy,' he says. 'We're seeing that play out in real life. LGBTQ+ people and women and people of color are the primary targets.' The 'don't say gay' bill, Minter notes, is very similar to what's been passed in Russia, tethering American conservatives to their authoritarian counterparts who have successfully rolled back democratic norms across eastern Europe. 'There is a worldwide authoritarian resurgence and our country is not immune from that,' Minter says. 'I've seen this movie before over the last 30 years: The right wing decided to target the LGBTQ community, whether it's around marriage or adoption or trans kids playing sports or bathrooms,' says the California state senator Scott Wiener, who is gay. 'One state does something, and then they all start proposing it.' Wiener introduced legislation to explicitly make California a refuge for families who may no longer feel that they can raise a queer or trans child in states such as Texas. 'I thought it was really important to push back on the policy level, and to send a clear signal that California and other states really care about these kids,' he says. He believes that 'don't say gay' is 'patently unconstitutional' but also contends that relying on the judicial system to protect human rights may no longer be a sound option. 'Once the court lawlessly allowed that Texas abortion law to stay in place, that sent a powerful signal that we can't rely on the courts,' Wiener said. 'We have to rely on the political process.' But even that process has limits. Bella Blue, a burlesque dancer in New Orleans who is a pansexual, queer cis woman, homeschools a teenager whose stepfather is a trans man. Her child is 'very aware' of the full spectrum of human sexuality, she says, but 'he himself has not kind of landed' on a firm identity. 'I guarantee you when they're writing these bills, they're not asking how the kids feel,' she says. 'The only thing you can do is remember they're going to turn out to be whoever they are.' The urge to legislate the diversity of human experience so it conforms with the Christian-nationalist project Minter points to seems certain to intensify. Although the confirmation of Ketanji Brown Jackson didn't change the ideological balance of the supreme court, Republican senators' opposition to her consisted mainly of conjuring up a nonexistent sympathy for child abuse images, tying her to the QAnon-led tropes about satanic child trafficking that seem ever closer to Republican orthodoxy. Indeed, conservatives' messaging heading into 2024 feels like a hypercharged version of the eternal paranoia that America's very existence is forever on the cusp of annihilation at the hands of liberals, immigrants, and LGBTQ+ people. The far-right One America Network recently called Joe Biden the 'groomer-in-chief', alleging that Democrats are now the party of perversion, gender 'mutilation' and an end to human reproduction itself. This renewed movement, channeling itself through overheated rhetoric about 'parents' rights' that first gained traction during discussions of students masking up, now threatens to undo much of the progress America has made on LGBTQ+ rights over the last 15 years.", "db088515d6ac3d089b7cb669e9ac5929dfd5bb39f5a13a7e6c2aaa40": "When Bobby Kolade moved back to Uganda in 2018 after 13 years in the European fashion world, he was intent on joining the movement to ban secondhand clothes. The designer remembered buying used clothing at Uganda's biggest market, Owino in Kampala, as a child, but had since learned about the damage this trade is doing to the environment and to African textile industries. 'I see these clothes, and they offend me. I see white shirts with sweat stains and torn colours, and I feel oppressed,' says Kolade. 'What does it say about whoever's donating those clothes to us? And what does it say about our position in the world? It's rude, you know? It's really rude.' And yet today Kolade is launching a fashion brand made up entirely of repurposed secondhand clothing sourced in Uganda. Buzigahill is all about 'redesigning secondhand clothes and redistributing them to the global north, where they were originally discarded before being shipped to Africa'. Kolade describes Return to Sender, Buzigahill's first collection, as genderless, playful and raw. Each of the 250 pieces is unique, made from garments that have been cut up and artfully stitched back together. Prices range from $195 (PS150) for four-panel T-shirts to $530 for extended coats. Each garment has a 'passport' label identifying its country of origin and source. 'The thing I enjoy most is the workmanship you can see. You can tell somebody sat down with scissors, cut something up, then put it back together somehow,' says Kolade, who has sourced the materials himself over the past year. Initially, this meant jumping on boda bodas (motorbike taxis) to visit the huge warehouses next to the maze of stalls at Owino, where he would buy clothing bales imported from countries such as the UK, Germany and Canada. Later, he built relationships with clothes importers who would deliver bales - from silk scarves made in South Korea to T-shirts from Canada and the US - directly to Buzigahill's studio. Here, Kolade designs and produces the clothes along with his small team of tailors. Kolade describes the project as 'reactionary design' to the overconsumption of the global north, and the role Africa plays as 'a very effective waste disposal system for people's clothes'. When clothes in the west are discarded at charity shops or donation bins, most are sold by export companies. According to Oxfam, more than 70% of clothes donated globally end up in Africa. Unable to compete with the price of used clothing, local textile industries across the continent suffer. In 2015, members of the East African Community (EAC) - Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda - announced plans to ban secondhand clothing imports from their markets. But the US threatened to remove these countries from the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which gives African countries duty-free access to export certain products to the US. Only Rwanda went ahead with a ban in 2018, and, despite severe sanctions, the country's textile and garment sector is showing promise, growing 83% in value from 2018 to 2020. But used clothes continue to flow into Uganda, and that's what led Kolade to change his original vision of designing and producing clothes made in Uganda from Ugandan cotton, and for Ugandans. Initially grown using forced labour under British colonialism, Uganda has been producing cotton for more than 100 years. In the post-independence era, it had a thriving homegrown textiles industry. This deteriorated following Uganda's tumultuous politics in the 70s, combined with economic liberalisation in the 90s which enabled secondhand clothing to become the lucrative industry it is today. With just two textile mills remaining, only 5% of Ugandan cotton is consumed locally, with the rest exported in its raw form. These topics are interrogated in Vintage or Violence, a podcast hosted by Kolade and film-maker Nikissi Serumaga, who is also making a documentary featuring Kolade. The podcast explores why secondhand clothes dominate African textile markets, and what impact this has on local economies and cultures. 'International trade was designed such that, in a country like Uganda, our companies are not supposed to succeed,' argues Kolade. He and his team have faced multiple hurdles over the past year, including working on garments for weeks only for the fabric to disintegrate or stretch after being washed, and struggling to set up payment systems on their website. He says: 'I am trying to set up a positive story here, to show that we've reacted to an economic and political situation to come up with something fun and accessible, but it is menacing.' He eventually managed to set up a PayPal account for Buzigahill, but services such as Instagram shopping are not available for Ugandan products. 'If I ever read the phrase 'not available in your country', again, I will die!'  But he adds: 'When I've been completely frustrated at these processes, I've had to have some compassion, and to understand that what we're doing is actually quite absurd [sending secondhand clothes back to the global north]. For me as well, this isn't what I always intended to do.' Kolade is half-German, and could have dodged some of these challenges by setting up his company in Europe and distributing the clothes from there. 'But that's not the point. If we are dedicated to value addition in Uganda, then I want the funds to come directly to Uganda, and I want us to set up the systems.' He is passionate about Ugandan-made products, and has set up a non-profit called Aiduke, which promotes Ugandan fashion products to the local market, with the aim of expanding into global markets. Buzigahill has a 10-year plan to build small, specialised factories across Uganda, not only for repurposing used clothing but also for hand-woven textiles and artisanal production, and Kolade hopes to expand to neighbouring countries too. 'We have an opportunity here to start really thinking about the whole recycling, upcycling, repurposing industry, as opposed to only focusing on raw materials,' he explains. 'Waste has already become a commodity, but it's going to become an even more important one. So the sooner we're able to create industries using this waste as a commodity, the more progress we're going to make as a region.'

The Digital Services Act, or DSA, will force the largest online platforms to be transparent about their activities and assess and mitigate the harms their products may cause. And it's just the start. Governments around the world have their sights set on regulating big tech. It's a big enough issue for the billionaire owners of other platforms; imagine the pressures Musk will face when governments dangle benefits for Tesla or SpaceX in exchange for tougher content moderation against their critics. Whether Musk accounted for the regulatory changes ahead is unknown. Either way, Twitter is a global platform in which his cliche first amendment zealotry will confront some hard realities. One is that governments expect the companies to police their platforms to deal with everything from the illegal (think terrorist content, child exploitation) to the 'awful but lawful' (hate speech, electoral disinformation, foreign manipulation). Another is that, for Twitter to be broadly usable - indeed, for it to pursue its stated purpose of serving the public conversation - it needs rules to limit the racism, misogyny, antisemitism, Islamophobia and other ugly content that are not just awful for users but are specifically designed to drive marginalized communities off the platform. The choice for Musk is stark: double-down on his facile theory of online free speech and make the platform unpalatable for users and governments alike, or admit that times (and Twitter) have changed and he needs an approach that maximizes the platform's value for everyone, users and public alike. For more than a decade, people around the world have come to rely on Twitter's microblogging service as if it were the global town square. Although the platform has certainly come with its fair share of problems, Twitter's policy and safety teams have made significant strides in recent years to improve user experience. As such, those users are right to be worried about the company's purchase by Musk. He's made numerous oblique references to free speech on the platform, but his minimal elaborations about what that means to him have been contradictory at best. Musk calls himself a free speech 'absolutist' but has emphasized his desire to defeat the site's spam bots and 'authenticat[e] all humans.' Doing so would probably require users to submit identification of some sort, effectively ending real anonymity on the platform and creating a risky proposition for many users around the world, who may be wary about handing over their ID to a platform that complies with government requests for data. International users should be cautious: In a recent interview with TED founder Chris Anderson,Musk stated that he thinks 'obviously Twitter or any forum is bound by the laws of the country that it operates in.' While true on face, this ignores Twitter's long history of aggressively fighting in court to protect the free speech rights of its users, and refusing legal demands to remove content when deemed unjust. If Musk retains the company's experienced teams and can learn to listen to experts, Twitter may be just fine. But if he continues to operate with the same level of hubris that got him here, it may be time for us to start looking for a new online home. Much of the discussion about Musk's Twitter purchase has focused on how the platform's content moderation practices may change. I agree that is a vital issue, but it is not the only one. Twitter has a longstanding policy of allowing users to operate pseudonymously. Unlike competitors such as Facebook, Twitter does not require users to operate under their real names. 'We're not wedded to pseudonyms,' then-Twitter CEO Dick Costolo said in 2011, 'we're wedded to letting people use the service in the way they see fit.' As I document in my new book about anonymous speech, Twitter's anonymity-friendly policies have allowed members of many marginalized groups to use the platform in ways that they never would have been able to had they been required to post under their real names: political dissidents around the world, domestic abuse victims, and so many others. We do not know what, if any, changes to these policies Musk plans. In a news release announcing the purchase on Monday, Musk included 'authenticating all humans' as one of his goals for improving Twitter, but did not specify how Twitter would accomplish his goal. Perhaps authentication would mean a technology - such as Captcha - that does not require disclosure of identifying information. Or Twitter may offer all users the option of having verified accounts, but still allow pseudonymous posters who do not verify their identities. A far more troubling route would be to require all users to verify their identities. As Twitter figures out how it plans to authenticate all humans, I hope that it will keep in mind the benefits of anonymity to so many people. Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter is emblematic of America in 2022: a nation dominated by plutocrats whose freedom to operate is unconstrained by laws or countervailing power. The directors of Twitter, a public company, accepted a $46.5bn go-private offer from a billionaire who approached them without a plan, financing, or having followed SEC rules for such transactions. The deal will take place at a price significantly below where Twitter's stock traded last summer, and was consummated in a matter days, limiting the opportunity for alternative bidders to compete. The notion that a serial violator of SEC rules can undertake one of the largest go-private transactions in history without regulatory scrutiny is disappointing, but not surprising. Musk has a great opportunity. Despite being the most important internet platform for politicians, celebrities and journalists, Twitter has never achieved its financial potential, and has a cumulative net loss since inception. The product is deeply flawed. Content moderation policies have failed to prevent Twitter from becoming what its most active users call 'a hellsite' overrun by harmful content. We do not know if Musk will make Twitter better, but the fact that unaccountable billionaires like Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have so much influence on our democracy is a policy failure.", "953b160f2d92e89850772baf32ddc7f3330799c3041e577f747e486d": "", "6122832d52aa97b6b5a98790837a4383d65a7e6485a9e2b292eac61d": "", "4d68f23eb27e98b1a8bccacb4b8b3a97895171ffaeb11d042c35686a": "In an address to lawmakers in St Petersburg earlier today, Vladimir Putin warned any countries attempting to interfere in Ukraine would be met with a 'lightning-fast' response from Moscow. The Russian president said the West wanted to cut Russia up into different pieces and accused it of pushing Ukraine into conflict with Russia, adding: Russian troops would not hesitate to use the most modern weaponry, Putin said: Thank you for following our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This blog has now closed. You can find our latest coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war in our new live blog in the link below. Here is a little more on our earlier story on how Ukrainians are renaming streets and squares associated with Russia. Cities in Ukraine have in recent days begun to rename streets associated with Russian figures or to dismantle monuments related to the Soviet Union. The city of Ternopil, in western Ukraine, has renamed a street dedicated to the Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, and removed a Soviet tank and aircraft. The aircraft is to be replaced with a 'heroes of Ukraine' monument. Fontanka, a village near Odesa, decided to turn a street dedicated to the poet Vladimir Mayakovsky into Boris Johnson Street, after the UK promised to send a PS100m weapons package to Ukraine. And the mayor of Dnipro, Borys Filatov, said streets named after Russian towns would be rededicated to Ukrainian cities and symbols: Abkhazia Street became Irpin, while the street of the 30th Irkutsk Division is now called Ukrainian Soldiers. Russia has nearly doubled its revenues from selling fossil fuels to the EU during the two months of war in Ukraine, benefiting from soaring prices even as volumes have been reduced, Guardian reporter Fiona Harvey writes for us today. Russia has received about EUR62bn from exports of oil, gas and coal in the two months since the invasion began, according to an analysis of shipping movements and cargos by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. For the EU, imports were about EUR44bn for the past two months, compared with about EUR140bn for the whole of last year, or roughly EUR12bn a month. The findings demonstrate how Russia has continued to benefit from its stranglehold over Europe's energy supply, even while governments have frantically sought to prevent Vladimir Putin using oil and gas as an economic weapon. A number of Ukrainian cities plan to rename streets and squares associated with Russia under a process of 'derussification' following Moscow's invasion. A day after the dismantling of a huge Soviet-era monument in Kyiv that was meant to symbolise friendship between Russia and Ukraine, the city council said on Wednesday it had compiled a list of 467 locations that could be considered for renaming, Reuters reports. They included a central square named after 19th century writer Leo Tolstoy and a street named Russia's Lake Baikal. A road named after Minsk, the capital of close Russian ally Belarus, was also on the list. Since Ukraine declared independence of the Soviet Union in 1991, the names of some cities have been changed to erase the legacy of hated Soviet officials. Some officials now want to remove the names of Russian authors, poets and mountain ranges, the news agency reports. Ihor Terekhov, mayor of the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, said on Wednesday that as soon as the war with Russia was over, he would table a bill to his city council to rename places with Russian-affiliated names. 'Even without these names, there will be too many scars that will remind us for a long time about what kind of neighbour is beyond our eastern and northern borders,' he wrote on the Telegram messaging app. Cities and towns in Ukraine's north have started the process of renaming streets after army units that defended them. Under a proposal by the governor of the Chernihiv region, streets or squares in the regional capital would be renamed after the 1st Separate Tank Brigade. Here are some of the latest images to come out Ukraine today. Countries opposed to Russia's invasion of Ukraine must double down on their support for Kyiv, including the supply of heavy weapons, tanks and aeroplanes, British foreign secretary Liz Truss has said.  So far Britain, EU states, the US and other allies have supplied weaponry to help Ukrainian forces fight the Russian army, but they have stopped short of engaging in direct conflict with Moscow.  Truss outlined a new approach in which countries should spend more on defence, and where Nato takes a more global outlook while economic dependency on aggressor nations is reduced. Watch the video of Truss' remarks below. Russia has deployed trained military dolphins at its naval base in the Black Sea - possibly to protect its fleet from an underwater attack - according to new analysis of satellite images. The US Naval Institute (USNI) reviewed satellite imagery of the naval base at Sevastopol harbor, and concluded that two dolphin pens were moved to the base in February at the start of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Russia has a history of training dolphins for military purposes, using the aquatic mammal to retrieve objects or deter enemy divers. The Sevastopol naval base is crucial for the Russian military, as it sits in the southern tip of Crimea which Moscow seized in 2014. According to the USNI's analysis, many of the Russian ships anchored there, while out of range from missiles, are potentially vulnerable to undersea attacks. Ukraine had also trained dolphins at an aquarium near Sevastopol, in a program born out of a Soviet-era scheme that fell into neglect in the 1990s. During the cold war, both the US and the Soviet Union developed the use of dolphins whose echolocation capabilities can allow them to detect underwater objects such as mines. A supplemental budget request that includes Ukraine aid could be sent to the Congress as soon as Thursday, the White House said on Wednesday. The plan will cover military, humanitarian and economic assistance for Ukraine, White House spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters. More than 4,000 applications have been filed to sponsor Ukrainians seeking to come to the US within 48 hours of the Biden administration launching 'Uniting for Ukraine,' a streamlined process for those fleeing war-torn Ukraine, a USCIS spokesperson told CNN.  The move comes come nearly one month after Biden pledged to admit up to 100,000 Ukrainians fleeing Russia's invasion and is designed to more quickly get Ukrainians interested in coming to the US. 'This new humanitarian parole program will complement the existing legal pathways available to Ukrainians, including immigrant visas and refugee processing. It will provide an expedient channel for secure legal migration from Europe to the United States for Ukrainians who have a US sponsor, such as a family or an NGO,' Biden said. Fresh from his visit to Russia to meet Vladimir Putin, the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres arrived in Kyiv on Wednesday where he is due to hold talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Thursday. The rouble soared to a more than two-year high against the euro in Moscow trade on Wednesday, Reuters reports. Russia halted gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland for rejecting its demand for payment in roubles on Wednesday. By 2:18pm GMT, the rouble had gained 1.8% to trade at 75.43 versus the euro , its strongest since early March 2020. It was 1.1% stronger against the dollar at 72.75 . Canadian lawmakers have voted unanimously to call Russia's attacks in Ukraine a 'genocide', with members of parliament saying there was 'ample evidence of systemic and massive war crimes against humanity' being committed by Moscow. The Canadian House of Commons' motion said war crimes by Russia include mass atrocities, systematic instances of wilful killing of Ukrainian civilians, the desecration of corpses, forcible transfer of Ukrainian children, torture, physical harm, mental harm, and rape, Reuters reports.  Earlier this month, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said it was 'absolutely right' for more and more people to describe Russia's actions in Ukraine as genocide, supporting an accusation made by US President Joe Biden a day earlier. Uniper, Germany's top importer of Russian gas, will transfer payments for Russian gas to a Russian bank and no longer to a Europe-based bank, newspaper Rheinische Post is reporting.  'The plan is to make our payments in euros to an account in Russia,' the daily paper cited a Uniper spokesperson as saying. Even though Russia has demanded rouble payments for its gas, the payments system it has proposed foresees the use of accounts at Gazprombank, which would convert payments made in euros or dollars into roubles. This offers wiggle room some countries could try to use to keep buying Russian gas against western currencies. The European Commission said last week that if buyers of Russian gas confirmed payment was complete once they had deposited euros, as opposed to later when the euros have been converted to roubles, that would not breach sanctions. Uniper said it considered Russian gas flows into Germany secure for now despite a halt in supplies to Poland and Bulgaria as transit volumes headed elsewhere would be unaffected. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy also addressed what he called Russia's 'energy blackmail' against Europe in his nightly national address.  Zelenskiy said Russia's decision to cut off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria shows 'no one in Europe can hope to maintain any normal economic cooperation with Russia'. The White House has denounced Russia's move to cut off energy supplies to Poland and Bulgaria. Press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at a daily briefing on Wednesday: Kazakhstan may declare a prominent Russian television host persona non grata after he said the central Asian nation could meet the same fate as Ukraine if it did not side decisively with Russia, a Kazakh official said on Wednesday. Reuters has this report below: Tigran Keosayan - married to Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of the Kremlin-backed media outlet RT - said on his YouTube show that Kazakhstan was being 'ungrateful' and 'sly' by failing to show its support for Russia. Kazakh foreign ministry spokesperson Aibek Smadiyarov said Keosayan's comments were 'insulting' and lacked objectivity. Kazakhstan, an oil-rich former Soviet republic, has so far not condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine but has called for the crisis to be resolved in line with the United Nations charter. It has also sent humanitarian aid to Ukraine, and has said it will abide by Western sanctions against Moscow.

The Ukrainian defence ministry said on Wednesday Russian forces had pushed Kyiv's army out of Velyka Komyshuvakha and Zavody, in the north-eastern Kharkiv region, and gained control over Zarichne and Novotoshkivske in Donetsk. The Kremlin said this month it was pulling its forces out from around Kyiv to focus on capturing the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk in Donbas, which have been controlled by pro-Russia separatists since 2014. A defiant Vladimir Putin vowed on Wednesday that Russia would achieve its military goals. 'All the tasks of the special military operation we are conducting in the Donbas and Ukraine, launched on 24 February, will be unconditionally fulfilled,' the Russian president told parliament in Moscow.  Pavlo Kyrylenko, the governor of the Donetsk region of Donbas, said on the Telegram messaging app that Russian forces 'continue to deliberately fire at civilians and to destroy critical infrastructure'. The interior ministry of Moldova's pro-Russia breakaway region of Transnistria, which borders western Ukraine, said on Wednesday that shots were fired overnight from Ukrainian territory towards a village housing a large Russian ammunition depot. The ministry also said drones were observed over the village, and it claimed they too had been launched from Ukraine. Its statement came after a series of explosions in the unrecognised region that authorities there referred to as terrorist attacks. Russia's foreign ministry has refused to rule out Transnistria - occupied by Russian forces for decades - being drawn into the war, saying Moscow was 'concerned' by the explosions targeting the state security ministry, a radio tower and military unit. It was not clear who was behind the blasts in Transnistria but the attacks gave rise to international alarm that Moldova could be Russia's next target, or that Moscow could try to use the breakaway region as another launching point to attack Ukraine.  Ukraine's deputy defence minister, Hanna Malyar, on Wednesday accused Russia of preparing to use Transnistria as a bridgehead, while president Volodymyr Zelenskiy claimed Russian 'special services' were working to 'destabilise the situation'. The UN and US have expressed alarm but have not yet backed Kyiv's claim that Moscow was responsible for the incidents.  Meanwhile, blasts were heard on Wednesday in three Russian provinces bordering Ukraine, reports said, and an ammunition depot near Staraya Nelidovka in Belgorod province caught fire. Russia earlier this month accused Ukraine of attacking a fuel depot in Belgorod but Kyiv has not confirmed responsibility for incidents reported on Russian territory. The Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said it was natural that Russian regions where fuel and weapons were stored were learning about 'demilitarisation' - a pointed reference to Moscow's stated objective for the nine-week-old war in Ukraine, which it calls a special military operation to disarm and 'denazify' its neighbour. 'If you [Russians] decide to massively attack another country, massively kill everyone there, massively crush peaceful people with tanks, and use warehouses in your regions to enable the killings, then sooner or later the debts will have to be repaid,' Podolyak said. 'Karma is a cruel thing.' Russia's defence ministry said its Kalibr missiles had struck an arms depot in Ukraine's southern-central Zaporizhzhia region storing 'foreign weapons and ammunition supplied to Ukrainian troops by the US and European countries'. The ministry said Russia's air force destroyed 59 Ukrainian military targets overnight. Petro Andryushchenko, an official in Mariupol, said Russian forces hit the Azovstal steel plant there, where about 2,000 Ukrainian fighters and 1,000 civilians are still holed up, with 35 airstrikes over 24 hours. Despite the collapse in ties between Russia and the west, Moscow and Washington carried out a prisoner swap on Wednesday. The US freed a Russian pilot, Konstantin Yaroshenko, who had been jailed on drug trafficking charges, while Russia released former US marine Trevor Reed, who was accused of fighting with police.  Zelenskiy has been pleading for heavier firepower to push back the Russian advance in Donbas but western allies are wary of being drawn into an outright war with Russia. With Moscow's potentially critical eastern offensive under way, however, Washington pledged on Tuesday to move 'heaven and earth' to enable Ukraine to win. Germany announced on Tuesday it would send self-propelled anti-aircraft guns to Ukraine, reversing its much-criticised cautious stance on heavy weapon supplies. The UN refugee agency UNHCR has said it expects more than 8 million Ukrainians to eventually flee their country, with nearly 5.3 million having already left, and that $1.85bn will be needed to host them in neighbouring countries.", "8671de43c5cd0fe76f762985fbdefd5ebfa7003b37fb2bd8b8911b0c": "While tanks and troops exchange fire in Donbas, Ukraine faces another escalating battle on another invisible front line - one that may be equally crucial to determining the outcome of the war. Russia is stepping up attacks on infrastructure deep into western parts of the country that Moscow has admitted for now it cannot capture, striking targets that keep both the war effort and the national economy running, including the railway network, a critical bridge and fuel depots. The aim of Russian attacks is likely to slow the rapidly expanding delivery of weapons from Nato allies to the eastern front, while also hindering exports of grain and other commodities that help Kyiv pay for the war. With the country's Black Sea ports are closed to shipping, overland routes are even more vital. 'It is my opinion that they didn't believe the west will give Ukraine the necessary heavy weapon supplies so now the process is started, they feel they need to do something about that,' said one Ukrainian military official monitoring the infrastructure attacks. 'Because western weapons and Ukrainian combat experience combined give us a big advantage.' On Monday, five railway stations were hit by Russian missiles. The head of Ukraine's railways company, Oleksandr Kamyshin, said it was the heaviest assault on his system since the war began. 'The repair of all infrastructure damage will take months,' he acknowledged in a news conference. Fuel depots have been another regular target, along with a critical bridge that provides the only overland link on Ukrainian territory to the southern Bessarabia region. A spokesman for Ukraine's defence staff said infrastructure was being hit to stop western arms shipments. 'Russians are attacking military and civilian infrastructure to prevent getting weapons from our partners,' Oleksandr Shtupun told a press conference. Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said in a broadcast on state TV: 'These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia's military. Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once. How can it be otherwise?' It is not a one-sided battle. A series of destructive explosions and fires at strategic locations inside Russian territory and neighbouring Belarus - fuel depots and railways - are widely considered the work of Ukrainian forces, although none have been claimed officially by Kyiv. In the early weeks of the war, Ukrainian forces were highly effective at damaging Russian logistics in areas that were contested or recently seized. But in this round of attacks both countries are targeting infrastructure deep inside enemy-held territory. Senior presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak in a tweet about 'self-destructing' Russian infrastructure appeared to hint broadly at his country's role; on the list of destroyed assets he gave was the Moskva ship, widely acknowledged to have been sunk by a Ukrainian missile. 'How can we not believe in karma for the murder of [Ukrainian] children? Many are still willing to turn a blind eye to financing terrorism by buying Russian oil. But should the European Union depend on a country where everything is self-destructing?' he said. The operations on Russian territory have often been bold and spectacular, boosting morale as much as hindering the enemy's capacity. They include a daring helicopter raid on the border town of Belograd and Sunday night's attack on oil storage facilities near a critical crude pipeline junction in Bryansk. The same night another blast near Bryansk took out a military rail spur used to bring rockets and other munitions from storage onto the main railway network, a Ukraine security source said. And a powerful radio control tower destroyed in Transnistria, part of Moldova controlled by Russian-backed separatists, was broadcasting propaganda across the region and may also have been used for military communications. The battle over infrastructure deep inside enemy-held territory is an area where Ukraine may be more vulnerable than Russia because of the size of the country, the extent of Russia's military resources and the battle for the air. While not dominant in the skies, it is still easier for Russian planes, drones and helicopters to fly over Ukraine than the reverse and its own skies are largely open, while the government in Kyiv relies entirely on land transport for its military and economic lifelines. 'Rail has always been important [in Ukraine] for exporting things like coal, grain and steel, but it no longer has access to sea ports so a lot more has been going by rail out of the country,' said Tracey German, professor in conflict and security at King's College London. 'So potentially this isn't just a way of disrupting the military effort but also of putting pressure on the country economically.' Russians perhaps did not move strongly against these targets at the start of the war because President Vladimir Putin anticipated a quick victory and perhaps the Russian military thought they would be using the infrastructure themselves. They also expected to control the skies, which would have made it easier to deny access to roads and railways, said Niklas Masuhr at the Center for Security Studies thinktank in Switzerland. Now there are strong military incentives for a campaign behind front lines. 'The focus has shifted towards the Donbas and there are two underlying drivers of attacks on infrastructure, particularly in western Ukraine. They are potentially trying more to cut off supplies into the Donbas, create a battle of attrition in that part of Ukraine.' 'With strikes on Lviv and Kyiv they may also be trying to hit targets throughout the country, to force them to disperse air defence systems throughout the country, so they don't have them where needed in the Donbas.' For Ukraine to win this battle, it needs more air defences for the west, in addition to the heavy weapons and short range air defence systems heading east, the Ukrainian military source said. 'Ukraine on its own cannot protect any inch of its territory from the threat from the air, because Ukraine uses very old aerial defence systems,' the source said. 'Britain is sending short-range things that work great in Donbas. But the strategic thing really necessary for Ukraine is heavy and long-range defence systems to close the skies over [relatively] peaceful areas of the country.'", "a7b6beee0036fe8211dd2317228b398878271b520bb9974991f990e8": "", "7b74a7ffeabb9109a25b8a7a087ede12392ff1e5314fe3362c3f7aab": "A series of mysterious explosions in Moldova have raised the threat of Russia's war in Ukraine spilling over into new territory, with unpredictable consequences. The blasts destroyed radio antennas in a Russian-garrisoned sliver of eastern Moldova along the Ukrainian border, Transnistria, which had been peaceful since a brief conflict in 1992 waged by Kremlin-backed separatists against the Moldovan army. The separatist authorities blamed the incidents on Ukrainian infiltrators while the Kyiv government alleged they were false-flag attacks designed to provide a pretext for an infusion of Russian troops, to add to the 1,500 already based there, just as similar blasts in the Donbas preceded the 24 February Russian invasion of Ukraine. Those allegations were given greater weight when residents in Transnistria received fake SMS texts on Tuesday warning of an imminent Ukrainian attack. The Moldovan president, Maia Sandu, convened an emergency meeting of her security council and declared that forces were at play in Transnistria which were 'interested in destabilising the region'. A Russian move into Transnistria would pose an imminent threat to the sovereignty of Moldova, a country of 2.6 million people which, like Ukraine, has shown increasing interest in joining Nato. It would also menace Odesa, the Ukrainian port city which lies on the Black Sea coast between Moldova and Russian-occupied Kherson. Four days ago the commander of Russia's central military district, Rustam Minnekayev, said Moscow's goals involved the seizure of southern Ukraine, so as to give Russia control over the Black Sea coast and access to Transnistria. On Tuesday, Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of Russia's security council and one of Vladimir Putin's closest advisers, raised another grim specter, declaring that Ukraine could fragment into 'several states', blaming such an outcome on western intervention. The threat of dismemberment follows the humiliating failure of Putin's primary war aim, to subjugate all of Ukraine and install a friendly government in Kyiv. The massive offensive launched in February was unable to break Ukrainian resistance while Moscow was unable to deter Nato support. Repeated Russian warnings, explicitly brandishing the world's biggest nuclear arsenal, have had a diminishing impact. Finland and Sweden look set to declare their readiness to join Nato next month in time for the alliance summit at the end of June, shrugging off suggestions from Moscow that such a move would lead to the westward deployment of Russian forces, including nuclear missiles. On Monday, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, tried amplifying the threat, accusing Nato of fighting a proxy war in Ukraine and warning that the danger of nuclear conflict 'should not be underestimated.' But barely 12 hours later, Germany dropped its earlier escalatory reservations about supplying heavy weapons to Ukraine, and announced that it would be sending 50 Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft guns. That announcement, by the defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, was made at Tuesday's meeting of approximately 40 countries at Ramstein airbase, to coordinate and enhance western military support for Kyiv that marked a raising of the stakes by Ukraine's backers. Announcing the UK's own contribution of anti-aircraft systems, defence minister James Heappey went further, saying it would be 'entirely legitimate' for the weapons to be used against supply lines inside Russia. In response Russia has started bombing the supply lines bringing in western arms, targeting railways and bridges and threatening to hit Kyiv. As the Ukraine war evolves, the parties to the conflict are redefining their aims. Russia has abandoned outright conquest for now, and is seeking to carve out a contiguous zone of occupation reaching as far as Transnistria, which Putin can package as 'Novorossiya', the foundation for a new Russian empire. The Biden administration meanwhile has emphatically confirmed that its objectives go beyond the defence of Ukraine to the hobbling of Russia's capacity to carry out further acts of aggression. 'What we want to see is a free and independent Ukraine and at the end of the day, that will involve a weakened Russia and strengthened Nato,' the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Mark Milley, told CNN, echoing remarks made by the defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, the day before. 'What's at stake here is much greater than Ukraine,' Milley added. 'If Russia gets away with this cost-free, so goes the so-called international world order and we enter an area of serious instability.' With the start of this new phase in the war, a layer is being stripped away from the buffer that has thus far kept Nato and Russia from coming into direct, hostile contact, during the cold war and since. And if the ominous explosions in Transnistria are auguries of a new Putin gambit, Moldova could find itself to be the next proving ground where this dangerous new world makes itself felt.", "a84fc882b2bad06d1d8e32be085a019da3d89f4fe2e72ee6de361af1": "Emmanuel Macron narrowly missed being hit by a bag of tomatoes during a surprise visit to a working-class area north of Paris, as he promised a new style of 'listening to people' after his re-election as president. In his first public appearance since Sunday's vote, Macron strolled around a food market in the town of Cergy, north-west of Paris, shaking hands and posing for selfies. Most people were friendly, some shouted congratulations and others asked for help in finding a job, dealing with health problems or making ends meet. But at one point there were briefly boos, and a bag of tomatoes was thrown towards Macron's back but missed. A bodyguard opened an umbrella to shield the president, who quickly sidestepped the projectile and continued to greet people and shake hands. The Elysee Palace said the trip was Macron's way of 'listening to people's concerns, expectations and needs'. He told local young people that he wanted to get out on the ground 'from the start'. One young woman replied: 'Don't just come here for the photos.' Another onlooker said: 'It's good that he's getting out of the Elysee.' Macron won a second term at the weekend, beating the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen by 58.5% to her 41.5%, but on the campaign trail he faced accusations of being haughty and aloof and of not understanding people's concerns about the cost of living, housing, jobs and poverty. He had struggled to shake off the tag of 'president of the rich'. Macron said in Cergy: 'I want to give a message of respect and consideration to these areas that are among the poorest in the country, right from the start of my mandate.' He acknowledged that deprived, high-rise neighbourhoods surrounding Paris had some of the highest abstention rates in the presidential vote. Macron said 'life was hard' there and some people felt angry or cut off from politics, and not enough progress had been made in recent years to improve their lives.  He said there were problems of discrimination, and a need for training schemes, more doctors and better health care in these areas, as well as job creation. 'We've brought down unemployment here, but it's still above the national average because of discrimination and not enough training,' he said after meeting young local entrepreneurs. Macron, the first French leader to be re-elected for a second term in 20 years, is now focused on parliamentary elections in June. He will need a centrist majority in the 577-seat house in order to put in place his manifesto plans, including overhauling the benefits system and raising the pension age. Pollsters believe he has a good chance of winning a majority. Cergy is a leftwing area where the radical-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon topped the presidential vote's first round. Melenchon is attempting to strike alliances with other parties on the left to challenge Macron's centrists in the parliamentary elections. Melenchon's party, La France Insoumise, which has 17 seats in parliament's lower house, wants to expand by hundreds more to win a majority for the left. The Socialist party and the Greens (EELV) on Wednesday began talks on possible parliamentary alliances with Melenchon to increase the number of seats on the left. Hurdles remain. The Socialists are traditional rivals to La France Insoumise, and some older Socialists warn against 'surrendering' the party's principles. The Greens favour an alliance, but some Green figures have said they will not compromise on their pro-Europe and anti-nuclear stance.", "f6a5f0006266a537fe7418ee83405d21a441e6315a02b22b2522085a": "Human damage to the planet's land is accelerating, with up to 40% now classed as degraded, while half of the world's people are suffering the impacts, UN data has shown. The world's ability to feed a growing population is being put at risk by the rising damage, most of which is caused by food production. Women in the developing world are particularly badly affected as they often lack legal titles to land and can be thrown off it if conditions are tough. Degraded land - which has been depleted of natural resources, soil fertility, water, biodiversity, trees or native vegetation - is found all over our planet. Many people think of degraded land as arid desert, rainforests maimed by loggers or areas covered in urban sprawl, but it also includes apparently 'green' areas that are intensely farmed or stripped of natural vegetation. Growing food on degraded land becomes progressively harder as soils rapidly reach exhaustion and water resources are depleted. Degradation also contributes to the loss of plant and animal species and can exacerbate the climate crisis by reducing the Earth's ability to absorb and store carbon. Most of the damage by people has come from food production, but consumption of other goods such as clothes also makes a big contribution. Much of the degradation is most visible in developing countries, but the root cause of overconsumption happens in the rich world, for instance in the increasing consumption of meat, which takes far more resources than growing vegetables, and fast fashion, which is worn briefly then thrown away. Without urgent action, degradation will spread further. By 2050, an area the size of South America will be added to the toll if current rates of harm continue, according to the Global Land Outlook 2 report. Ibrahim Thiaw, the executive secretary of the UN convention to combat desertification, said: 'Land degradation is affecting food, water, carbon and biodiversity. It is reducing GDP, affecting people's health, reducing access to clean water and worsening drought.' Restoring degraded land can be as simple as changing farming methods to terrace and contour farming, leaving land fallow or planting nourishing cover crops, practising rainwater harvesting and storage or regrowing trees to prevent soil erosion. Many farmers fail to take these steps owing to pressure to produce, lack of knowledge, poor local governance or lack of access to resources. Yet for every $1 spent on restoration, the UN calculates a return of between $7 and $30 in increased production and other benefits. Thiaw called for governments and the private sector to invest $1.6tn in the next decade to restore to health about 1bn hectares of degraded land - an area about the size of the US or China. This would amount to only a small proportion of the $700bn a year spent on subsidies to agriculture and fossil fuel, but would safeguard the planet's soils, water resources and fertility. 'Every single farmer, big and small, can practise regenerative agriculture,' he told the Guardian. 'There are a panoply of techniques and you don't need hi-tech or a PhD to use them.' Thiaw said: 'Modern agriculture has altered the face of the planet, more than any other human activity. We need to urgently rethink our global food systems, which are responsible for 80% of deforestation, 70% of freshwater use and the single greatest cause of terrestrial biodiversity loss.' About half of the world's annual economic output, or about $44tn a year, is being put at risk by land degradation, according to the report. But the economic benefit of restoring degraded land could amount to between $125tn and $140tn a year, which would be about 50% more than the $93tn recorded global GDP for 2021.

Trump discussed Calamari in a deposition for a civil lawsuit brought by Efrain Galicia, the activist who alleged the incident occurred while he was protesting outside Trump Tower in 2015. Calamari, who was later investigated in an unrelated tax fraud inquiry and who was hired as Trump's bodyguard before climbing the ranks to an executive position, is not being sued personally but was deposed as he oversaw security in his corporate role at the time of the alleged assault. Calamari's attorney, Nicholas Gravante, told the Guardian that the Manhattan district attorney would not be bringing charges against his client. Gravante said Calamari had 'done absolutely nothing wrong'. Trump, however, is named as a defendant. The lawsuit alleges that Trump, his business, his campaign and his security team 'undertook these wrongful acts by common agreement'. He was ordered to provide the deposition in October of last year. Trump also said in the deposition that tomatoes could be lethal when thrown at people, in response to questions about his telling the audience at a rally in February 2016: 'If you see someone getting ready to throw a tomato, just knock the crap out of them.' Galicia's case is one of many legal challenges Trump faces. This week, he was held in contempt for failing to disclose documents in the   civil investigation by Letitia James, the New York state attorney general, into whether the Trump Organization misstated the values of its real estate properties to obtain favorable loans and tax deductions. The Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, has also insisted that his office's investigation concerning Trump and the Trump Organization is proceeding, despite several high-profile resignations over inaction. In July 2021, the Trump Organization and its former chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg were charged for an alleged 'sweeping and audacious illegal payment scheme'. CNN reported in November that Manhattan prosecutors did not intend to charge Calamari, at least for the time being, but Trump's comments provide another glimpse into the former president's unorthodox involvement in personnel matters. Trump said in his deposition that he had hired Calamari about 40 years ago after seeing him take down hecklers at a tennis match. 'They had to stop the match because people up in the top of the stadium were screaming bad things,' Trump said. 'And the other security guards weren't doing anything about it. 'And Matt went up and the whole stadium was watching. And he spoke to the people, but they were screaming and they were really out of line,' Trump continued. 'And I guess they made the first move. But they went after him. And he went after them. And whatever had happened, he ended up on top. 'And the stadium was impressed because it was a certain brave, you know, there was a certain bravery there,' Trump said. 'It wasn't a big fight. It was not a real big fight. It was just, you know, he got them - and he got them to either calm down or I think he took them out. I think he took them out of the stadium.' Trump also said that he was responsible for promoting Calamari from security to corporate management and had 'authority' over his compensation. Galicia's lawyers also asked Trump about his statement to attendees to 'knock the crap out of' anyone getting ready to throw a tomato at the 2016 rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. 'It was very dangerous,' Trump said. 'They were going to throw fruit. We were threatened, we had a threat.'  He added: 'It's worse than tomato, it's other things also. But tomato, when they start doing that stuff, it's very dangerous. There was an alert out that day. 'It was said sort of in jest,' he added of his tomato comment. 'But maybe, you know, a little truth to it. It's very dangerous stuff. You can get killed with those things.' Trump also described pineapples and bananas as 'dangerous stuff'. Trump also defended Keith Schiller, his head of security at the time, for actions during the protest. Galicia alleges that Schiller punched him. 'He did nothing wrong,' Trump said of Schiller. Trump's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the deposition. Gravante disputed the depiction of events at the 1981 US Open as a 'fight'. Calamari, then a college football player, had been hired for a temporary security position through his coach. One day at the tournament, Calamari was asked to remove disorderly fans from the venue, as their jeers had interrupted the match. They didn't come voluntarily, so Calamari 'had to actually tackle him and carry him out of the stadium, to a standing ovation by everyone in that stadium who saw what was happening, and then the match could resume', Gravante said. Because Calamari handled the situation 'so perfectly', he was honored among the 'unsung heroes' of the US Open during a ceremony in 1982. At that point, Trump asked the US Open's head of security for the athlete's phone number and whether the athlete wanted a job, ultimately leading to Calamari's hiring. Gravante said that if Trump described the events with fight-centered language, it was not 'an accurate characterization of what happened at the US Open that day'.", "9d6c03f5e7c7d6c0ab6d4f66410f35862b5c6812b662bf668abfa14d": "Accusations of sexual misconduct levelled at Tim Westwood while he was working for the BBC have left the broadcaster facing yet another reckoning over whether its safeguarding and whistleblowing procedures are trusted by its staff. Out of the seven women who made claims about the DJ's behaviour, five say it took place while Westwood was working for the national broadcaster. Although none of the allegations relate to incidents that took place on BBC premises, several women suggest the presenter used his position as the highly influential host of the Radio 1 Rap Show to approach them. Yet none of the individuals made a formal complaint to the broadcaster about his behaviour. As a result, just as BBC director general Tim Davie is trying to modernise the broadcaster, he once again finds himself having to look backwards. Uncomfortably for him, Davie was in charge of the BBC's radio division between 2008 and 2012, when Westwood was coming to the end of a 20-year stint with the broadcaster - and when some of the alleged incidents took place. Speaking at a media conference on Wednesday, Davie said the BBC has not found any records of formal complaints about the presenter's behaviour - although it is now urging anyone to come forward with their concerns. He said an issue with media organisations is the way that power can reside both with the senior executives and also with the on-air individuals who present the output: 'All organisations have power residing in different places and there's nothing worse in life than abuse of power.' Davie has already gained much experience of dealing with whistleblowing issues at the BBC, having briefly served as acting director general in 2012 during the crisis caused by the decision to cancel an investigation that could have exposed Jimmy Savile as one of Britain's most prolific paedophiles. Last year, in the wake of the scandal over how Martin Bashir used doctored financial records to obtain an interview with Diana, Princess of Wales, he again emphasised a beefing-up of the corporation's whistleblowing protections and pledged to create a work culture where staff felt able to formally register their concerns. The revelations of the investigation into Westwood's behaviour also pose questions for commercial media company Global, which has provided Westwood with a show on its Capital Xtra for the last nine years. In 2020 the media company was approached about concerns raised by anonymous accounts on social media but - accompanied by denials from the presenter - backed him for another two years, before dropping the host on Wednesday. Westwood has strenuously denied all the allegations against him. A spokesperson for him said: 'In a career that has spanned 40 years, there have never been any complaints made against him officially or unofficially. Tim Westwood strongly rejects all allegations of wrongdoing.'", "6c46bef4b240581ff29fb8d873916409e5061730ff83b05e6b71b7d8": "The frontrunner in the Philippines presidential race, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, has praised his father - the country's late dictator - as a 'political genius', and his mother as the dynasty's 'supreme politician', less than two weeks before an election that could return the Marcos family to power. Ferdinand Marcos Jr, known as Bongbong, has a clear lead in the polls ahead of an election on 9 May, despite his father's notorious history. In an interview with CNN Philippines, Marcos Jr praised the political skill of his father and his mother, Imelda: 'Even my father I don't think would object if I say [Imelda] is the supreme politician in the family. My father is the statesman, he is the political genius. 'My mother can connect with anyone - from her classmates from I don't know how many years ago, to the person working in the palengke [wet market], to the queen of England. Everyone becomes her friend,' he said. Marcos was ousted from power in the 1986 People Power Revolution, but the family returned from exile in the 1990s and has over the decades sought to re-establish their place in politics, including by using social media to rebuild their reputation. His son's campaign and supporters have been accused of seeking to rewrite history, and of coordinated efforts to spread online misinformation and attack opponents. In January, Twitter suspended hundreds of accounts that were promoting Marcos Jr's campaign for violating its rules on spam and manipulation. Marcos Jr denied the existence of any such organised social media networks. Marcos Jr has denied or downplayed allegations related to his father's rule. It's estimated that as much as $10bn was plundered by the family. Under martial law, which was imposed by Marcos in 1972, 34,000 people were tortured, 3,240 people were killed and 70,000 were imprisoned, according to Amnesty International. Imelda Marcos, whose infamous shoe collection became a symbol of the family's excess, has previously said it was her son's destiny to become president. However, Marcos Jr said that, while he had consulted his mother over whether to run for president, it was his own decision. Bonifacio Ilagan, who was detained during the rule of Marcos Sr, and who is a convener of the Campaign Against the Return of the Marcoses and Martial Law, said it was the Marcos family's dream 'to reclaim their lost glory'. 'I will be the last one to believe that the Marcos family is not involved in the scheme to get the Marcoses back in power,' he said. Should Marcos become president, there would be little hope of achieving justice, said Ilagan. 'So much of what has happened will be negated in terms of the [People Power Revolution] uprising ... It will also mean the victims of the violations of human rights during his father's dictatorship will never be able to find justice.' While a law has been passed to provide compensation to victims of martial law, funds amassed by the family are yet to be fully recovered. 'We still want the Marcoses to return the billions of dollars that they stole from government,' he said.", "352adcce3fd80f501f890f162854b2f9d09cc6f3819d83ba4f3c1fc5": "", "240388cc66b79b6cda8d7fe3ece2b2934112ab7fee44c5fc0301adaf": "One day when she was 12 years old and still new to the ways of remembering the dead, Ana Isabel Bustamante took a photograph from the wardrobe where her mother kept her dark clothes and her most precious things. Ana set the picture on a small table in the living room, where it remained for two days. On the third day, unable to look at the young, bearded face in the photo any longer, her mother put it back in the wardrobe. The man in the picture was Ana's father, Emil Bustamante Lopez, a veterinarian, sociologist and political activist who was arrested in Guatemala City on 13 February 1982. Emil never made it to the family party for which his wife was making a cake that day. Nor did he ever meet Ana, his younger daughter, who was born eight months later. Instead, he became one of the 40,000 people who were forcibly disappeared during Guatemala's 36-year civil war. Four decades after he vanished, his family has filed a case with the UN human rights committee, a panel of independent experts that monitors countries' compliance with the international covenant on civil and political rights. It is the first time the committee has been asked to look into a case of enforced disappearance in Guatemala. Although she never knew her father, Ana's life - like those of her mother, Rosa Maria, and her sister, Flora - has been ineluctably shaped by his disappearance. After Emil went missing, Rosa Maria grabbed Flora and fled to Mexico, where Ana was born and where they lived until she was four. While Rosa Maria did everything she could to protect herself and her daughters from physical harm, there was little she could do to protect all three of them from the psychological fallout of losing a loved one to forced disappearance: the anger; the grief; the desolation, and the terrible, endless not knowing. 'There's no linear grieving process with forced disappearances,' says Ana, a film-maker who has lived in Spain for the past 12 years. 'As long as there's the possibility that the person could still be alive - although you know they aren't - as long as there's no body or grave, you can't finish the grieving process. You move forward and then back, forward and then back.' Four years ago, Ana released a film called La asfixia (Suffocation), in which she chronicled her attempts to get to know her father and find out what happened when he was disappeared at the age of 32. As she searched for traces of him in photos, videos, letters, her mother's memories and the old family home, she discovered both the extent of her father's secret involvement with the communist Guatemalan Labour party and the scale of her mother's suffering and resilience. 'I wanted to show the feelings that arrests and forced disappearances bring about in family members,' says Ana. 'I wanted to show the fight my mother has had to put up; I wanted to stress what she and so many other women have been forced to go through because people have said, 'If you don't look for your disappeared loved one, then you're complicit'. But if you did look for them they called you a communist.' During the seven years it took her to make the film, Ana examined her own feelings of abandonment and the wider psychological consequences of a conflict that claimed 200,000 lives and involved acts of genocide perpetrated against Guatemala's indigenous Mayan population. 'Forced disappearances create an island of inner pain,' says Ana. 'You're too afraid to talk about the disappeared victim and so you can't find any support groups. And that leaves you alone with your pain.' Ana and her family know the UN investigation will be a long, slow process. They also know that the chances of learning exactly what happened to Emil are slight, as is the likelihood of finding his body. 'I'd love to find a grave and for his remains to be there. Then I'd be able to say, 'Here he is. This happened'. But it's very complicated as they did such a good job of making sure the victims wouldn't reappear.' The aim of filing the case to the UN committee is to remind people what happened in Guatemala and to make them understand that the decades of violence didn't draw to a neat end with the signing of the peace accords in 1996. Although the former Guatemalan dictator Efrain Rios Montt was found guilty of genocide in May 2013, the conviction was swiftly overturned by the country's constitutional court, and the impunity continues to this day. 'I want people to know about what happened in Guatemala because it's still very unknown,' says Ana. 'I want people to know about it and for them to understand the scale of the horror of the arrests and forced disappearances: the victims aren't just the people who disappeared; they're also the families who are left behind and left broken. The living are also victims.' Teresa Fernandez Paredes, human rights adviser at the World Organisation Against Torture - which is helping the family with the UN case - says the collapse of the rule of law and attacks on judicial independence under Guatemala's current president, Alejandro Giammattei, mean those seeking justice have little choice but to look beyond the country's borders. 'The prospects for the families of the more than 40,000 identified victims of forced disappearance are very bleak,' says Fernandez. 'The only hope at this stage lies with the international community, particularly with the case of Ana Bustamante and her family that is now before the UN Human Rights Committee. The victims of the armed conflict are still asking for justice. They deserve to find their relatives, to bury and mourn them.' Whether she ever finds her father's body, Ana feels her investigations have at least brought her closer to the man she never met. She now knows the answer to the question she once asked her mother as a little girl: 'Did my dad go away because he didn't want to meet me?' Until she made Suffocation, she had always assumed that accounts of her dad were more than a little hagiographical. 'I thought that was just people speaking nicely of the dead; I thought he had to have had his flaws,' she says. 'After all, he'd hidden stuff from my mother and he'd left me - so he couldn't have been so great. But I discovered that he was a wonderful, caring and committed man. I also found out about the beautiful love story he had with my mother, which I'd had no idea about. It also led me to understand my mother's pain - a pain she has never overcome.'", "9191e9e4f520719f1ab7d9e11ce2e7e62b0e9e7e39e386e7f5b30296": "", "27c74f1bd77626469ebbfa1c8b4beda2bdc33c0239daa4830501d22e": "Name: Potholes. Age: Generally a few months to a few years old, and getting older. Appearance: A roughly circular absence of road, in the middle of the road. I've seen a lot of them about lately. You're likely to see more. Funding cuts to rural councils of PS480m will lead to an estimated 11m potholes going unfilled. Is it an expensive endeavour? It only costs, on average, about PS41 to fill in a single pothole, but the damage to cars can be immense. The RAC deals with about 27 pothole-related breakdowns every day. I'd like to help, but what can one person do? You could take matters into your own hands. Is that a thing? Increasingly it is. Elizabeth Williams, 89, got tired of the 3ft-wide potholes outside her home in Wyncote Court, Newcastle upon Tyne, so she paid to have them filled in. How much? PS4,000. That's a little above my budget. Eventually, she was reimbursed by the property services company responsible for the upkeep of the roads on her estate. Any other examples of this sort of altruistic infrastructure maintenance? Yes, in March singer Rod Stewart grabbed a shovel and assembled a crew to fill in the potholes near his Essex estate. Had the road become hazardous? Oh, yes. 'My Ferrari can't get through here at all,' said Stewart. Freelance pothole-filling is beginning to sound like a rich person's game. As hobbies go, it's not cheap. I know a joke about this: why can't you get public money to fill in potholes you've allowed to build up in your private driveway? Actually, you can. Cos it's your own asphalt! Wait, what? You can: PS333,000 of public money from the government's Getting Building Fund was recently spent repairing potholes in the poorly maintained driveway of Tory peer Lord Gage's East Sussex estate. But it's his own-ass fault! Apparently, there's a museum somewhere on Lord Gage's extensive grounds that will benefit from improved access. I don't care! He ruined my joke! I'm sorry. When I think about poor old Sir Rod out there in his hi-vis, shovelling away. I know. It's terrible. Or poor Elizabeth Williams, having to pay to fix her own street.

The European Council - the body of EU leaders - is 'from a democratic point of view, a monster' and 'totally dysfunctional', she says. The European Commission is 'shamelessly protecting' autocratic governments, over enforcing the rule of law. And the European parliament, the veteran MEP thinks, 'is not playing its role within European democracy'.  While EU leaders have applauded the unprecedented speed of EU sanctions against Russia, taboo-breaking decisions to fund lethal weapons for Ukraine and help Ukrainian refugees, in 't Veld thinks the war has only exposed the EU's 'dysfunctional' governance, a complex patchwork of institutions where national governments are ultimately in charge. 'I very much welcome the fact that the European Union is now taking steps [to support Ukraine], that there is more integration; I think that is long overdue, but that also increases the need for a more democratic union,' she told the Guardian. The European Peace Facility, which is funding weapons for Ukraine, she points out, is neither scrutinised by the European parliament, nor national legislatures. Instead, a group of member state officials meet behind closed doors to sign off its annual budget and accounts. In 't Veld supports EU funds to arm Ukraine, but thinks more transparency is needed: 'So we are spending EUR1.5bn [PS1.24bn] without democratic oversight on weapons and I think that's a very good illustration of why we need a drastic and quick reform of the European Union.' Such views don't make her very popular, even in her own group of centrist MEPs. She recounts one colleague 'really shouting at me' for 'attacking' the commission. While in 't Veld supports the EU's Ukraine policy, she doesn't think MEPs should stop asking difficult questions: 'Since when is parliamentary scrutiny considered to be an attack? I think it's an attack on democracy if there is no parliamentary scrutiny.' It is an argument she makes in a recent book, The Scent of Wild Animals, which calls for a radical overhaul of how the EU works. The title was inspired by the late co-founder of her D66 party, Hans Van Mierlo, who spoke admiringly of the animal spirits in the Dutch parliament. In 't Veld would like to see the same cut and thrust in Brussels and Strasbourg: 'The European parliament has to be a true political arena, with the scent of wild animals, blood, sweat and sawdust,' she wrote. Instead, too many MEPs lack a parliamentary spirit, she thinks. This month [April] the European parliament revived 'Question Hour' with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. A process intended to hold the EU executive to account, several MEPs used their slot to make mini speeches and throw in several sprawling questions. It was 'a joke' says in 't Veld. 'There were the kind of questions, where I thought: 'people if this is what you want to know, do a Google search'. This is not a political question'.' The European parliament has three problems, she says: a large number of first-time MEPs, Covid and Brexit. Although MEPs have resumed meetings in Brussels and Strasbourg, much work still happens online. 'People are stuck in their homes looking at a screen and they are much closer to national politics than before,' she said. Then there is Brexit: the European parliament waved goodbye to the UK's 73 MEPs in January 2020. A couple of years on, 'the parliamentary tradition of the UK is sorely lacking' in Brussels, in 't Veld says. The UK provided 'a cohort of people who saw the parliament as a counterweight to the EU's other institutions. Bit by bit I am beginning to realise how important they were for the political culture here'. When the commission was recently found guilty of maladministration by a European watchdog over text messages von der Leyen had exchanged with the chief executive of Pfizer at the height of the pandemic, while negotiating billion-euro vaccine deals, the European parliament did nothing. 'Can you imagine any other leader of the government or the executive doing this and the national parliament being mum? I'm just totally shocked. I don't know what to say,' said in t' Veld. If the European parliament is too weak, in 't Veld believes that EU leaders are too powerful and too unaccountable. She would abolish the European Council, which she describes as 'fundamentally undemocratic' because of its ambiguous role that is neither fully executive nor legislator. That, she admits, will not happen, but instead she would like more transparency about how it makes decisions. It's a view many would challenge. Luuk Van Middelaar, a political theorist and former adviser to the European Council president, has argued the EU showed 'a remarkable dynamism and resilience' in its response to the Covid pandemic, largely as a result of decisions made by EU heads of government. The increased role of the European Council in multiple late-night crisis summits on the eurozone, Brexit, migration and Ukraine, is also said to make the EU more democratic and visible to voters. In 't Veld disagrees: 'Yes [EU leaders] have legitimacy to their own people, but they have no mandate nor legitimacy for taking European decisions... I cannot vote for this council. I can't hold them to account. I cannot even demand transparency.' And the MEP deplores that each government wields veto power, including Hungary's prime minister Vikor Orban, recently re-elected in a contest independent monitors said was tilted in the ruling party's favour. 'This guy was elected in unfair elections ... He is taking decisions that affect us all, I mean quite literally decisions of war and peace, life and death ... At national level something like this wouldn't happen. In most democracies, if there is someone in government who has broken the law, they have to resign.' She welcomes the victory of the pro-European French president Emmanuel Macron and the defeat of Slovenia's right-wing populist prime minister, 'Orban copycat' Janez Jansa. 'It matters if out of 27 government leaders two are anti-European or pro-European, it makes a difference.' But she doesn't see any government supporting the fundamental changes she advocates. 'It matters what kind of European Union they are advocating: I see no move anywhere in the member states to go for a more supranational European Union, more democratic.'  In part, the debate is an old fault-line: should the EU be led by powerful Brussels-based federal institutions, or is it a club of member states, where national capitals take the big decisions, with the commission as a secretariat. Today's EU is a mix of both, but the intergovernmental idea, championed by the former French president Charles de Gaulle decades ago, has been in the ascendancy for at least twenty years. Research shows that the commission is less likely to take wayward member governments to court than in the past, highlighting the sway of national governments over Brussels. 'The commission doesn't want to piss off the member state governments,' contends in 't Veld. 'And that is sort of the end of everything: you can pass as many laws as you like, but if they are not being enforced then there is no rule of law, because then everything becomes arbitrary.' To counter this, she argues the commission needs to be more independent of national governments. So she would scrap the rule of having one EU commissioner per member state. And the European parliament should have the power to dismiss individual commissioners, she thinks. Under current rules, to vote out one commissioner, MEPs have to bring down all 27. But the European parliament needs to start with itself, in 't Veld argues: 'Parliament doesn't use its political powers. If you mention ... motion of censure, or forcing the commission to resign, then everybody looks at you as if you are a sort of dangerous radical with a bomb in your hand. But, sorry, this is a very mature tool in any normal, mature democracy and it's happening all the time. 'In the past two years, governments have been sent packing in the EU. It's not the end of the world. The sun still rises the next day. So why are we so afraid of our own shadow?'", "bd8458f54412762de6bb29417428d29de4b5e447663806a90b93e75f": "", "c7faaf02b2dd4e7f21fc0391f8476cf92836c81dbf9d3b1a25985c01": "When the job of a young east coast-based analyst - we'll call him James - went remote with the pandemic, he didn't envisage any problems. The company, a large US retailer for which he has been a salaried employee for more than half a decade, provided him with a laptop, and his home became his new office. Part of a team dealing with supply chain issues, the job was a busy one, but never had he been reprimanded for not working hard enough. So it was a shock when his team was hauled in one day late last year to an online meeting to be told there was gaps in its work: specifically periods when people - including James himself, he was later informed - weren't inputting information into the company's database. As far as team members knew, no one had been watching them on the job. But as it became clear what had happened, James grew furious. Can a company really use computer monitoring tools - known as 'bossware' to critics - to tell if you're productive at work? Or if you're about to run away to a competitor with proprietary knowledge? Or even, simply, if you're happy? Many companies in the US and Europe now appear - controversially - to want to try, spurred on by the enormous shifts in working habits during the pandemic, in which countless office jobs moved home and seem set to either stay there or become hybrid. This is colliding with another trend among employers towards the quantification of work - whether physical or digital - in the hope of driving efficiency. 'The rise of monitoring software is one of the untold stories of the Covid pandemic,' says Andrew Pakes, deputy general secretary of Prospect, a UK labor union. 'This is coming for almost every type of worker,' says Wilneida Negron, director of research and policy at Coworker, a US based non-profit to help workers organize. Knowledge-centric jobs that went remote during the pandemic are a particular area of growth. A survey last September by review site Digital.com of 1,250 US employers found 60% with remote employees are using work monitoring software of some type, most commonly to track web browsing and application use. And almost nine out of 10 of the companies said they had terminated workers after implementing monitoring software. The number and array of tools now on offer to continuously monitor employees' digital activity and provide feedback to managers is remarkable. Tracking technology can also log keystrokes, take screenshots, record mouse movements, activate webcams and microphones, or periodically snap pictures without employees knowing. And a growing subset incorporates artificial intelligence (AI) and complex algorithms to make sense of the data being collected. One AI monitoring technology, Veriato, gives workers a daily 'risk score' which indicates the likelihood they pose a security threat to their employer. This could be because they may accidentally leak something, or because they intend to steal data or intellectual property. The score is made up from many components, but it includes what an AI sees when it examines the text of a worker's emails and chats to purportedly determine their sentiment, or changes in it, that can point towards disgruntlement. The company can then subject those people to closer examination. 'This is really about protecting consumers and investors as well as employees from making accidental mistakes,' says Elizabeth Harz, CEO. Another company making use of AI, RemoteDesk, has a product meant for remote workers whose job requires a secure environment, because for example they are dealing with credit card details or health information. It monitors workers through their webcams with real-time facial recognition and object detection technology to ensure that no one else looks at their screen and that no recording device, like a phone, comes into view. It can even trigger alerts if a worker eats or drinks on the job, if a company prohibits it. RemoteDesk's own description of its technology for 'work-from-home obedience' caused consternation on Twitter last year. (That language didn't capture the company's intention and has been changed, its CEO, Rajinish Kumar, told the Guardian.) But tools that claim to assess a worker's productivity seem poised to become the most ubiquitous. In late 2020, Microsoft rolled out a new product it called Productivity Score which rated employee activity across its suite of apps, including how often they attended video meetings and sent emails. A widespread backlash ensued, and Microsoft apologised and revamped the product so workers couldn't be identified. But some smaller companies are happily pushing the envelope. Prodoscore, founded in 2016, is one. Its software is being used to monitor about 5000 workers at various companies. Each employee gets a daily 'productivity score' out of 100 which is sent to a team's manager and the worker, who will also see their ranking among their peers. The score is calculated by a proprietary algorithm that weighs and aggregates the volume of a worker's input across all the company's business applications - email, phones, messaging apps, databases. Only about half of Prodoscore's customers tell their employees they're being monitored using the software (the same is true for Veriato). The tool is 'employee friendly', maintains CEO Sam Naficy, as it gives employees a clear way of demonstrating they are actually working at home. '[Just] keep your Prodoscore north of 70,' says Naficy. And because it is only scoring a worker based on their activity, it doesn't come with the same gender, racial or other biases that human managers might, the company argues. Prodoscore doesn't suggest that businesses make consequential decisions for workers - for example about bonuses, promotions or firing - based on its scores. Though 'at the end of the day, it's their discretion', says Naficy. Rather it is intended as a 'complementary measurement' to a worker's actual outputs, which can help businesses see how people are spending their time or rein in overworking. Naficy lists legal and tech firms as its customers, but those approached by the Guardian declined to speak about what they do with the product. One, the major US newspaper publisher Gannett, responded that it is only used by a small sales division of about 20 people. A video surveillance company named DTiQ is quoted on Prodoscore's website as saying that declining scores accurately predicted which employees would leave. Prodoscore shortly plans to launch a separate 'happiness/wellbeing index' which will mine a team's chats and other communications in an attempt to discover how workers are feeling. It would, for example, be able to forewarn of an unhappy employee who may need a break, Naficy claims. But what do workers themselves think about being surveilled like this? James and the rest of his team at the US retailer learned that, unbeknownst to them, the company had been monitoring their keystrokes into the database. In the moment when he was being rebuked, James realized some of the gaps would actually be breaks - employees needed to eat. Later, he reflected hard on what had happened. While having his keystrokes tracked surreptitiously was certainly disquieting, it wasn't what really smarted. Rather what was 'infuriating', 'soul crushing' and a 'kick in the teeth' was that the higher-ups had failed to grasp that inputting data was only a small part of his job, and was therefore a bad measure of his performance. Communicating with vendors and couriers actually consumed most of his time. 'It was the lack of human oversight,' he says. 'It was 'your numbers are not matching what we want, despite the fact that you have proven your performance is good'... They looked at the individual analysts almost as if we were robots.' To critics, this is indeed a dismaying landscape. 'A lot of these technologies are largely untested,' says Lisa Kresge, a research and policy associate at the University of California, Berkeley Labor Centre and co-author of the recent report Data and Algorithms at Work. Productivity scores give the impression that they are objective and impartial and can be trusted because they are technologically derived - but are they? Many use activity as a proxy for productivity, but more emails or phone calls don't necessarily translate to being more productive or performing better. And how the proprietary systems arrive at their scores is often as unclear to managers as it is to workers, says Kresge. Moreover systems that automatically classify a worker's time into 'idle' and 'productive' are making value judgments about what is and isn't productive, notes Merve Hickok, research director at the Center for AI and Digital Policy and founder of AIethicist.org. A worker who takes time to train or coach a colleague might be classified as unproductive because there is less traffic originating from their computer, she says. And productivity scores that force workers to compete can lead to them trying to game the system rather than actually do productive work. AI models, often trained on databases of previous subjects' behaviour, can also be inaccurate and bake in bias. Problems with gender and racial bias have been well documented in facial recognition technology. And there are privacy issues. Remote monitoring products that involve a webcam can be particularly problematic: there could be a clue a worker is pregnant (a crib in the background), of a certain sexual orientation or living with an extended family. 'It gives employers a different level of information than they would have otherwise,' says Hickok. There is also a psychological toll. Being monitored lowers your sense of perceived autonomy, explains Nathanael Fast, an associate professor of management at the University of Southern California who co-directs its Psychology of Technology Institute. And that can increase stress and anxiety. Research on workers in the call centre industry - which has been a pioneer of electronic monitoring - highlights the direct relationship between extensive monitoring and stress. Computer programmer and remote work advocate David Heinemeier Hansson has been waging a one-company campaign against the vendors of the technology. Early in the pandemic he announced that the company he co-founded, Basecamp, which provides project management software for remote working, would ban vendors of the technology from integrating with it. The companies tried to push back, says Hansson - 'very few of them see themselves as purveyors of surveillance technology' - but Basecamp couldn't be complicit in supporting technology that resulted in workers being subjected to such 'inhuman treatment', he says. Hansson isn't naive enough to think his stance is going to change things. Even if other companies followed Basecamp's lead, it wouldn't be enough to quench the market. What is really needed, argue Hansson and other critics, is better laws regulating how employers can use algorithms and protect workers' mental health. In the US, except in a few states that have introduced legislation, employers aren't even required to specifically disclose monitoring to workers. (The situation is better in the UK and Europe, where general rights around data protection and privacy exist, but the system suffers from lack of enforcement.) Hansson also urges managers to reflect on their desire to monitor workers. Tracking may catch that 'one goofer out of 100' he says. 'But what about the other 99 whose environment you have rendered completely insufferable?' As for James, he is looking for another job where 'toxic' monitoring habits aren't a feature of work life.", "440680428d1224a8f4d0333e4f448201df1c3a6cdcdd678689af73c9": "", "7602286e5a5073a164cbfce0ee24f2d0c05cf33737bf21b9cfc9af1e": "", "d28a084edef327ef73f19e26844dc6ebcca4741dd1a986df17d1752f": "", "5f0522dcad8a1be4512a466839f1165c6b63655c3090e9f8850da009": "", "d4302ac04a01778feea301653f5178d5d615b2d576b3fdc83b4f9afb": "", "d269ba84e7a16f50b5355cdb66a9882f964cf839a3a26d2dfe6dee9e": "", "e760c0e0570f03e366e793c17ed40cefa68f8e242aa5feded6457c64": "", "f911d9a3111d70aeeb530960a25aa95d22edefa301df5163c49e02cd": "", "93c060ef5181276f9a9642810c5a79ccc8ff58fce976d84cdbbce0e7": "", "3492f615f331a57e046c2d764baf070161da6e027861fe39b5eb91bd": "", "a181cfd1801448df8408ecdb1516dfe45489c50e33059ebd55dbb602": "", "b2a3d8213baa033a86f4f4a3c6ed8a594288121e7f749d3cbf1dc2b6": "", "5e603e859e7c5e52b40a5d03b1c82fd694570d7350919aa1c6eb342d": "From a former ice factory becoming a shiny home for offices and shops, to a Victorian bus works getting a new lease of life as a flexible workspace, across the country, buildings are being retrofitted and repurposed for the future. It stands in stark contrast to what seemed like the commercial property industry's motto in recent years: knock it all down and start again. For several decades, buildings such as office blocks weren't designed or built with longevity in mind. When parts and equipment such as lifts and windows wore out, landlords often opted for demolition over refurbishment. But against the backdrop of the UK's race to reach net zero by 2050, the climate crisis has forced all sectors of the economy to consider their emissions, prompting property owners and developers to look again at the impact of construction. While buildings have become much more energy-efficient to run, huge amounts of energy are required - and therefore large amounts of carbon - emitted during the manufacture of components as well as in the construction. These emissions, occurring before a building is even in use, create what is known as 'embodied carbon'. 'Twenty years ago, if you looked at the overall carbon impact of a building, then 80% of it might have come from how you use it,' said Chris Cummings, director at Savills Earth, the estate agent's sustainability team. 'With a brand new glass and steel building in London now, 95% to 98% of the building's impact will be in the materials, because it's going to be lean and be using green energy, and the grid is decarbonising.' The prize on offer for decarbonising the entire life cycle of a building is significant. The World Green Building Council calculates that construction, together with the energy required to heat, cool and power buildings, accounts for almost 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Tenants are increasingly demanding more efficient buildings, too, and their landlords are trying to deliver this by giving old structures a new lease of life. Comprising two Victorian warehouses, a former bus factory in Islington, north London, known as the Busworks, was bought for PS45m last year by the flexible office provider Workspace, which is turning the history-rich building into modern offices. 'Going back 30 years, you built a HQ building with the view that someone would probably knock it down and build it again in 25-30 years,' said Cummings. He believes developers are once again planning on buildings with a long life, or even several lives: 'Going back further it was: 'we need something which lasts 100 years', and I think it's coming back to that now.' In central Birmingham, close to the canal and some of the city's buzzing bars and restaurants, one of these major refits is taking place. 10 Brindleyplace, formerly offices of NatWest (previously the Royal Bank of Scotland) and apartments, has been stripped back and is covered by scaffolding and plastic sheeting. Two buildings are becoming one, and only the frame, foundations and basement have been retained, which will save some embodied carbon. 'The life expectancy for plant [equipment and fittings] is 20 years,' said Nick White, asset manager at CBRE Investment Management, which is behind the PS40m transformation. 'The lifts, air con, mechanical and electrical systems were at the end of life and were breaking down.' Rather than just replacing worn-out equipment, the building is being completely reconfigured inside and out, transformed into a modern workspace. About 212,000 sq ft (19,695 square metres) of open office space is being created, larger windows installed, and six roof terraces built for outdoor working and meetings. The works were planned and under way before Covid hit, but the developers believe the building is primed for the post-pandemic world of work, equipped with a gym, bike racks and showers. 'Offices have got to fundamentally work harder,' said Theo Holmes, director in CBRE's office agency team. 'There is a flight to quality, and creating an environment for getting more out of staff. The building has to operate to meet changing needs.' Due to be ready by the time Birmingham hosts the Commonwealth Games in July, the retrofitted building will be more efficient than before, powered by green energy including 840 sq ft of solar panels.Such energy transformations aren't limited to the newer buildings. Historic sites, and even those with protected status, are also getting in on the act. Grosvenor, the Duke of Westminster's property company, which can trace its links with London property back to 1677, is retrofitting its London portfolio, including 500 Grade I- and II-listed buildings. In an attempt to cut its carbon emissions, the company's UK property arm has pledged to invest PS90m by 2030 in retrofitting and reducing the operational emissions of its buildings. A former ice factory, near Victoria station in central London, is one of these projects. Built in 1830, it was most recently a car garage, but is being turned into a five-storey building for offices, shops and a rooftop restaurant. Grosvenor Property UK's chief executive, James Raynor, brought forward the company's target date for reaching carbon neutrality by five years to 2030 last October. Along with retrofitting, this will be achieved by carbon offsetting, and increasing the company's use of renewable energy. 'Why wait until 2030 to offset?' said Raynor. 'We know the challenges that we face, and the climate crisis is there, flashing big warning lights.' Grosvenor's first net zero carbon office development is also under way: a 1980s office block at Holbein Gardens, close to Sloane Square, is being turned into a modern workspace. Raynor says tenants are demanding more efficient buildings and understand that these won't necessarily be the newest structures. 'At the top end of the office market, we are starting to see that people will walk away from buildings that don't offer great environmental credentials,' he said. 'It's in the interest of developers, ourselves and others, to make sure that everything has the best credentials possible, otherwise they will stay empty which isn't really the point.' Alongside property companies, local authorities are increasingly looking to retrofitting to help them meet their emissions targets. Not all are following this path. Marks & Spencer has recently faced criticism over its plans to demolish its 90-year old flagship store close to Marble Arch in London. Following environmental concerns, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, reviewed the plans, but gave Westminster council the green light to approve the scheme, allowing the retailer to knock down the art deco building. Marks & Spencer said the site could not be developed further. It will be replaced with a 10-storey structure containing a smaller store, as well as offices and a gym. It has been estimated that the construction will create so much carbon dioxide that 2.4m trees would need to be planted to offset it.", "9ab72b7c6d42cdfcf2664160133881c15e4a54b57b2273b24726ab9c": "Kevin McCarthy, the senior Republican in the House of Representatives, privately accused one of his colleagues of 'putting people in jeopardy' in the wake of the January 6 insurrection, according to a leaked audio recording. In a phone call with Republican leaders on 10 January 2021, McCarthy said that Matt Gaetz, a Florida congressman and ardent Trump supporter, was putting Americans at risk with his comments after the assault on the US Capitol that left five people dead. The New York Times obtained a recording of the call, in which McCarthy and Republicans including Steve Scalise, the No 2 House Republican, discussed an interview Gaetz had given where he attacked GOP members who had criticized Trump. 'He's putting people in jeopardy,' McCarthy said of Gaetz. 'And he doesn't need to be doing this. We saw what people would do in the Capitol, you know, and these people came prepared with rope, with everything else.' In the days after the insurrection McCarthy strongly criticized Trump, saying: 'The president bears responsibility for Wednesday's attack on Congress by mob rioters.' Since then McCarthy has defended Trump's actions, suggesting Trump was unaware that the riot was taking place. In the 10 January call McCarthy also called out Mo Brooks, a congressman from Alabama who at a rally before Trump supporters attacked the Capitol said: 'Today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.' 'You think the president deserves to be impeached for his comments?' McCarthy asked those on the call. 'That's almost something that goes further than what the president said.' Discussing the statements and actions of some Republicans, McCarthy said: 'Our members have got to start paying attention to what they say, too, and you can't put up with that type of shit.' Lauren Boebert, a congresswoman from Colorado, and Barry Moore from Alabama, were among the other GOP members named in the call. Boebert has been a staunch defender of Trump's actions that day. 'Tension is too high, the country is too crazy, I do not want to look back and think we caused something or we missed something and someone got hurt,' McCarthy said in the call.", "2f41b7b24ba12faefaf00059306b8ff28478253b24bea693d8d5b797": "Canada's effort to phase out open-pen salmon farms has hit a roadblock after a federal judge said farmers had been blindsided by a government order to shut down. Federal court judge Elizabeth Heneghan ruled earlier this month that former fisheries minister Bernadette Jordan had failed to grant farm operators the right to procedural fairness when she announced plans to phase out the farms, and criticized the minister's lack of clarity surrounding the controversial decision that companies said would cost them millions in losses. In December 2020, Jordan announced that 19 salmon farms in the Discovery Islands, a region off the coast of British Columbia, would be shut down by 2022. She also said that no transfer of fish between hatcheries and the open-pen farms would be allowed during the 18-month phase-out period. In response to the order, salmon farmers have started shutting down their operations in the Discovery Islands - but have also fought the orders in court. In ordering the closure of the farms, Justin Trudeau's Liberal party was acting on the advice of a government commission into the decline of wild sockeye salmon. The Cohen commission found in 2012 that the Discovery Islands functioned as a bottleneck along salmon migration routes - and that closing the farms would reduce risk to wild salmon. Nine government reports, however, found the farms posed minimal risk to the wild salmon. '[Farmers] submit that they were not given notice of the scope of the decision nor notice that transfer licences would be banned,' Heneghan wrote in her decision, calling the minister's response to concerns 'inadequate'. The judge said that for a decision that would cost the companies millions in losses, the fisheries minister owed the companies a through explanation for her decision. 'A news release does not provide reasons. A news release is a means for a person ... to express a viewpoint of opinion. The consequences of the decision in this case are significant and the minister owed a duty to provide reasons.' Fish farming has become a flashpoint between environmental activists, First Nations leaders and farmers, but the recent ruling is a blow to Trudeau's pledge to phase out the industry in the region by 2025. In March, the First Nations Wild Salmon Alliance urged the government to continue working to close the farms, blaming 'fragmented management decisions at both the federal and provincial levels' for the 'precarious extinction-level state of wild salmon'. Last month, the premier of British Columbia warned the prime minister that closures without a clear transition plan would 'undermine the economies of dozens of communities' in the region. In closing the farms, Canada would have been one of the first countries in the world to force a shift from open-pen farming to closed water systems. In the United States, both Alaska and Washington state have looked to reign in fish farms amid growing concerns that the farmed salmon could pose a risk to ailing wild salmon stock. Last month, a newly released Canadian government report showed that for nearly a decade, its own scientists were concerned that farmed Atlantic salmon were a vector for spreading the highly contagious Piscine orthoreovirus. Heneghan's ruling also enforces a previous injunction which permits fish farms to restock salmon until the farms close. The BC Salmon Farmers association said it was 'encouraged' by the court decision. A spokesperson for fisheries minister Joyce Murray said she is aware of the court's ruling and will be making a decision on next steps soon. '[Minister Murray] remains committed to transitioning away from open-net pen salmon farming in coastal British Columbia waters,' said press secretary Claire Teichman.", "b4cc0d3ddc508bd66e73b7308f0d23ff8dc6df2e624c5d8f5b8a7493": "An Italian doctor who made headlines for pioneering windpipe surgery has gone on trial in Sweden, charged with aggravated assault for performing the experimental procedure. Paolo Macchiarini won praise in 2011 after claiming to have performed the world's first synthetic trachea transplants using stem cells while he was a surgeon at Stockholm's Karolinska Institute. The procedure was hailed as a breakthrough in regenerative medicine. But allegations soon emerged that the risky procedure had been carried out on at least one person who had not been critically ill at the time of the operation. The 63-year-old appeared in court on Wednesday, where he listened to translated audio as prosecutors listed the charges of 'aggravated assault' against three patients. The Karolinska Institute has confirmed that the three individuals have since died, but did not directly link the deaths to the operations. 'Macchiarini has carried out the surgery with complete disregard for science and tried experience,' prosecutor Karin Lundstrom-Kron told the court. As prosecutors presented their case they referenced both external and internal reviews of the case, including one published in 2016 by physician Kjell Asplund, who argued that Macchiarini should never have been employed by Karolinska in the first place. 'It is clear that this method has not worked,' prosecutor Jim Westerberg said, adding that Macchiarini had embellished the benefits of the procedure. Macchiarini, who took notes without showing much emotion, has maintained the operations constituted treatments and not experiments, and denied being criminally responsible. 'He contends that he has performed healthcare, cured and helped,' Macchiarini's lawyer, Bjorn Hurtig, told AFP during a recess. The prosecution's presentation of evidence is expected to continue over several days so the defence is unlikely to present its side until next week. But Hurtig said they had 'high hopes' they would be able to counter the prosecution's evidence. 'There are quite a lot of gaps in that evidence and there is a lot of evidence that we argue are favourable to our view of things,' he said. In 2013, the Karolinska hospital suspended all transplants and refused to extend Macchiarini's contract as a surgeon. A year later, several surgeons at the hospital filed a complaint alleging that Macchiarini had downplayed the risks of the procedure. Macchiarini carried out three surgeries at Karolinska University hospital in 2011 and 2012, using an artificial windpipe made of plastic and coating it with the patient's own stem cells. Together with his colleagues, he performed eight such transplants between 2011 and 2014, the five others taking place in Russia. An external review in 2015 found Macchiarini guilty of research misconduct, but despite sacking him, the Karolinska Institute repeatedly defended him until 2018, when it found him and several other researchers guilty. The university's principal stepped down over the scandal, as well as a number of others. In 2018, the Lancet medical journal retracted two papers authored by Macchiarini. The trial, held in the Solna district court near the Karolinska Institute, is scheduled to take place over 13 days.", "79ae3798f78a9fed25a66983f810d9cb118ad798913baf3d34879926": "Angela Rayner has hit out at claims that she viewed 'sexist slurs' made against her as a joke, amid a row between the Commons Speaker and the Mail on Sunday, whose editor rebuffed an invitation to discuss an article about the deputy Labour leader. David Dillon was asked to meet the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, after anger about comments made by Conservative MPs in a story about Rayner, in which they accused her of crossing and uncrossing her legs like the character played by Sharon Stone in the film Basic Instinct to distract Boris Johnson at prime minister's questions. On Wednesday, the Mail ran a response from Dillon saying he would not attend the meeting, as well as a story suggesting Rayner had joked about the comparison on previous occasions with Tory MPs as well as on a podcast. On comedian Matt Forde's The Political Party, Rayner said she was 'mortified' by an internet meme comparing her actions to the scene in Basic Instinct where Stone's character crosses and uncrosses her legs in front of detectives while not wearing underwear. She said: 'There is a tint of misogyny in it ... Every time I do a PMQs somebody has an opinion on what I wear. Did you see the meme on Sharon Stone like I was doing it at the last PMQs? I was mortified.' Forde asked her if the suggestion was that she was 'doing that to distract Boris', to which she replied: 'It doesn't take much, does it? I don't need to do that.' Rayner tweeted in response on Wednesday: 'I said to [Forde] in January that the sexist film parody about me was misogynistic and it still is now. As women we sometimes try to brush aside the sexism we face, but that doesn't make it OK. 'The Mail implies today that I somehow enjoy being subjected to sexist slurs. I don't. They are mortifying and deeply hurtful. 'She loves it really' is a typical excuse so many women are familiar with. But it can't be women's responsibility to call it out every time. I don't need anyone to explain sexism to me - I experience it every day. 'Boris Johnson gave assurances he would unleash 'the terrors of the earth' on the Tory MPs spreading this vile sexism. I hope to hear what he'll be doing about it today.' Hoyle told MPs on Monday he had arranged a meeting with Dillon after an outcry over the claims in the article. Dillon said he and his political editor, Glen Owen, would not be attending as journalists should 'not take instruction from officials of the House of Commons, however august they may be'. The Conservative MP Caroline Nokes, the chair of the women and equalities committee, wrote to Hoyle asking him to consider revoking the Commons pass of the article's author. However, Hoyle, who met Rayner on Monday, suggested it would not be right to remove his pass. Speaking before the meeting was rejected, he said: 'I am a staunch believer and protector of press freedom, which is why when an MP asked me to remove the pass of a sketch writer last week for something he had written, I said no. 'I firmly believe in the duty of reporters to cover parliament, but I would also make a plea - nothing more - for the feelings of all MPs and their families to be considered, and the impact on their safety, when articles are written. I would just ask that we are all a little kinder.' Downing Street has indicated Johnson disapproval of the Speaker summoning senior Mail editorial figures. The prime minister's spokesperson said Johnson was 'uncomfortable at the idea of our free press being summoned by politicians'. They added there should not be any kind of perception that politicians were seeking to control the media, and that it was right for newspapers and journalists to 'have editorial independence'. The spokesperson for Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, said it was a 'matter for the Speaker'. Rayner told ITV's Lorraine on Tuesday that she had told the Mail on Sunday: 'This is disgusting. It's completely untrue. Please don't run a story like that.' Conservative whips have claimed they will try to find out which Tory MP made the comments about Labour's deputy leader.", "de3adf9ff521844a368ee32c6911676c9fa0df3efd7db155d47a48a2": "Barely a day after it opened, Barcelona's smallest lending library has been forced to close after it was attacked by vandals. Barcelona's last surviving classic glass box telephone booth, which has been converted into a miniature book exchange, information centre and mobile charging point, opened on Saturday, when Catalans celebrate their patron Saint Jordi (Saint George) by exchanging gifts of books and roses. Two days later the damage was being repaired after vandals painted the booth with graffiti and stole the small screen displaying information about local events. 'We expect those responsible to pay for these intolerable and unjustifiable acts,' Jaume Collboni, the deputy mayor said. 'There is no place for vandalism in Barcelona.' The classic glass box booth, the last of its kind in the city, was remodelled and installed outside the civic centre in Sant Genis dels Agudells on the north-west edge of the city. Using a code available on request from the civic centre, citizens gain access via a keypad to the booth's 200 books while at the same time charging their mobiles. The booth is ventilated and at its inauguration was said to be both vandal- and graffiti-proof. It was moved from its original location nearby to the Placa Meguido, close to the Casa Groga civic centre that manages it. The miniature library is expected to reopen soon. Spain's first public telephone was installed in the Retiro park in Madrid over 100 years ago but this year Telefonica, the company responsible, plans to remove the 14,824 wall-mounted phones that remain in the country, 500 of them in Barcelona. Mobile phones have made them redundant and Telefonica estimates that it costs EUR4.5m (PS3.8m) a year to maintain the network, despite a study by the Spanish stock exchange commission published last year that found that only 1% of Spaniards had used a public telephone in the previous year and on average only one call a week is made from public phone boxes.", "87b3f9e091dde249ef3f9319523102bb871c5fc559efd5f2d6e71f55": "", "6323f1554e5982500bdf5a8051056d5316236517b3e0ea762667bb48": "Europe appears to be on the brink of an energy crisis that could further drive up household bills after Russia halted gas supplies to two EU countries and threatened others, in a move condemned by European leaders as blackmail. The immediate consequence of Gazprom's decision to stop supply to Poland and Bulgaria while warning other nations opposed to Russia's war in Ukraine that they could soon be hit was a 20% rise in the wholesale gas price. The move, described by Poland's prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, as a 'direct attack' on his country, was justified by the Kremlin as a response to a failure of the two countries to comply with demands for payments to be made in roubles. It has led, however, to a dangerous standoff as Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said any EU country giving in to Russia by paying for gas in roubles would be in breach of the bloc's sanctions regime, with which the UK and others have acted in lockstep. 'Gazprom's announcement that it is unilaterally stopping gas delivery to certain EU member states is another provocation from the Kremlin,' Von der Leyen said. 'But it comes as no surprise that the Kremlin uses fossil fuels to try to blackmail us.' While the initial rise on the wholesale market pared down to 8% later on Wednesday, the price of gas remains nearly seven times higher than a year ago, and experts warned of potential further pain for consumers should the supply crisis escalate. Britain has reduced the supply of gas from Russian gas fields to below 5%, but the privatisation of UK supplies in the North Sea ties consumers to international energy markets, leaving the UK exposed to rising prices. Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst for the UK and Europe at the foreign exchange company OANDA, said: 'This may be a warning sign to others in the hope that they don't follow suit, but if they do, the standoff could play havoc with energy prices. With the Kremlin putting itself in a position where it must apply the same punishment to all if they don't comply, Europe may find itself without Russian gas or looking weak.' In other developments: Despite the risk to Russia's own economy from the standoff over energy, Putin's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Wednesday that other countries could also lose supply if they followed Poland and Bulgaria in refusing to pay in Russia's currency. The EU imports about 40% of its gas from Russia, with Germany the biggest recipient. Putin is seeking payments in roubles in order to bolster the value of the currency, which has slumped to record lows since the imposition of sanctions. In Berlin, officials conceded that the development was a cause of worry. A spokesperson for the German economic ministry said: 'We are seeing with concern that there has been a stop of deliveries to European partner countries. We are coordinating closely within the European Union to consolidate the situation.' Opposition MPs in Germany called on the government to enact an embargo of Russian gas now in anticipation of further stops. 'Russia needs to know: when they hit one of us, we all respond,' tweeted Norbert Rottgen, of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). 'Therefore an oil and gas embargo is now also a question of European solidarity.' Von der Leyen sought to calm concerns, saying the EU had reached a deal with Joe Biden's White House for an increased supply of liquefied natural gas from the US this year and in the coming years. In response to claims from Gazprom on Wednesday that 10 unnamed European companies had already agreed to pay in roubles, Von der Leyen said this would be a breach of the bloc's sanctions regime. Hungary's foreign minister, Peter Szijjarto, said his government had struck a deal to pay into a euro-denominated account with Gazprombank, which in turn would deposit the amount in roubles to Gazprom Export. He claimed that Slovakia had reached the same agreement. Von der Leyen said she was coordinating with European capitals to maintain a unified position. 'This latest aggressive move by Russia is another reminder that we need to work with reliable partners and build our energy independence,' she said. 'Today the Kremlin failed once again in this attempt to sow division between Europeans. The era of Russian fossil fuels in Europe will come to an end. Europe is moving forward on energy issues.' Bulgaria's energy minister, Alexander Nikolov, said Russia was weaponising its dominant position in gas and oil supply. He said: 'It is clear that at the moment the natural gas is being used more as a political and economic weapon in the current war.' Putin said in March that countries that were 'unfriendly' over the war in Ukraine would have to change their method of payment for gas supplies. By refusing to switch to roubles, European governments were opting to 'punish Russia at any cost to the detriment of their own consumers, taxpayers and producers', a spokesperson for Putin said on Wednesday. The European Commission has said companies should continue to pay Gazprom in the currency agreed in their contracts, about 97% of which are in euros or dollars. Russia supplies about 55% of Poland's annual demand of about 21bn cubic metres of gas, but Poland is far more reliant on coal to heat homes and fuel industry, with gas accounting for only 9% of its overall energy mix. The Polish gas company PGNiG confirmed that supply had stopped but a spokesperson said its clients were still getting the fuel in line with their needs. The company said: 'Cutting gas supplies is a breach of contract and PGNiG reserves the right to seek compensation and will use all available contractual and legal means to do so.' In Bulgaria, Russian imports account for more than 90% of the country's gas needs but the government insisted on Wednesday that no restrictions would be imposed on domestic gas consumption for the moment. Nikolov said: 'As long as I am a minister and responsible for this, Bulgaria will not negotiate under pressure and with its head bowed. Bulgaria does not give in and is not sold at any price.' Gazprom said it would also stop moving gas through Poland and Bulgaria to others such as Germany if it discovered any withdrawal of volumes from pipelines. 'Bulgaria and Poland are transit states,' Gazprom said. 'In the event of unauthorised withdrawal of Russian gas from transit volumes to third countries, supplies for transit will be reduced by this volume.'", "170365813af16a9112175c50126c5c8918ee1713d3b4ddd5e1166ca0": "Italian children should be given the surnames of both parents, the constitutional court has ruled, overturning the tradition by which all newborns are automatically named after their fathers. The practice was 'discriminatory and harmful to the identity' of the child, the court said in a statement, adding that both parents should be able to choose the surname. Children should be given both parents' surnames in the order they decide, unless they agree their children should take just one of them, the court added in a statement. New legislation, to be approved by parliament, is required to implement the decision. The family minister, Elena Bonetti, said in a post on Facebook that the government would fully support parliament in this process. 'We need to give substance [to the decision] ... and it is a high priority and urgent task of politics to do so,' she wrote, adding that parents should take equal responsibility for the upbringing of a child. Pope Francis and Italy's political leaders have expressed concerns about the impact of a declining birth rate on the country, with the cost of raising children seen as one of the factors.

She certainly brings name recognition to the contest - but another contender may have her beat in that department. His name is Santa Claus. He lives, of course, in North Pole - a town of about 2,000 in Alaska. He has a big white beard and a kindly manner, and Santa Claus is indeed his legal name, though, as a Bernie Sanders supporter, he does not exploit elf labor. He won a city council seat in 2015, to the delight of observers around the world. Now he's ready to take his political career to the next stage. He's running to complete the term of the long-serving Republican congressman Don Young, who died last month at age 88. A special primary will be held on 11 June. As for Claus's politics: he's been called 'a bastion of blue on a city council as red as Rudolph's nose'. He says voters who look at Sanders' policy platform can get a pretty good idea of his own, including support for Medicare for All, racial justice, corporate accountability, and free and fair elections. That includes ranked-choice voting, which will feature in the second round of the coming election. 'That's what's given me the opportunity here,' he said. Ranked-choice voting 'gives people with name recognition such as yours truly, and even Sarah, for that matter, a slight advantage'. But Claus hasn't always had that name. 'Seventy-four years ago, I didn't pop out with a beard,' he says. In fact, Claus changed his name from Tom O'Connor in 2005. He was living in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, at the time, and pondering what he should do with his life, as Julia O'Malley wrote in a 2015 Guardian profile. He had previously worked in law enforcement, where he'd witnessed kids falling 'through the cracks' of the foster care system, and he wanted to do what he could to help them, he told the Anchorage Daily News in 2020. He'd already grown the beard, and as he prayed for guidance, someone in a car nearby shouted, 'Santa, I love you!' 'That's about as fast an answer to your prayer as I'd probably ever get,' Claus tells the Guardian. 'So next day, I called up the county clerk to change my name legally.' It caused a few headaches, including some brief suspicion at airport security, where he got 'the once-over'. 'Somebody about a month later sent out an email, I guess, letting people know, yeah, there's this guy Santa who's gonna be flying around. Not necessarily in my sleigh, but using regular transportation.' Despite his name, greeting children at Christmastime isn't his thing. 'I'm not really interested in that,' he says. 'There are plenty of my beloved helpers throughout the world who sort of stand in for me with their in-person visits.' Instead, he says, 'I tend to interact more with adults with respect to legislation.' To that end, shortly after changing his name, he embarked on a tour of every state, meeting with governors, their staffers and legislators to advocate for child welfare, as he told the Daily News. It was on this tour that he met his future rival for the congressional seat - and despite the political gulf between them, she made a good impression. 'Sarah Palin was one of the governors I visited,' he says. 'We met very briefly, but she had set up a meeting with six of her different department heads, which was quite unusual for a governor to do. So I was appreciative,' he says, saying Palin was 'very nice, very helpful to me'. As for their disagreements, Claus, who has not declared a party affiliation, is diplomatic. 'Now that she's been endorsed by Trump,' he says, chuckling, 'let me put it this way: being a Bernie supporter, we have disparate views on a variety of subjects.' He continues: 'I don't plan to get pushed around by her or by Trump. So it may have some interesting moments during the race,' for which he says he is not soliciting or accepting donations. 'As a candidate, as a legislator, I tend to look for common ground. There are people I disagree with and people who disagree with me. But there's always common ground and one's willing to make the effort to find it and then legislate for greater good.' The congressional election will determine who completes Don Young's term, ending in January. If Santa Claus wins, he doesn't plan to run for re-election. 'I think there should be people a decade two or three younger than I am stepping up and doing their best to help their communities and their states. For some positive change, I'd like to do my little part. 'Plus I think it'd be kind of fun. Alaska is known for kind of having characters up here. I would certainly be well within that tradition.'", "df68b23040dd437e01f0c437f08b61af42c16a62ea1587c684aa0cba": "For Alan de Leon, natural disasters are a way of life. Growing up in Houston, de Leon knew that late summer meant hurricane season, a time when his family took special care to save money and stock up on extra food. In recent years, those storms have gotten worse because of the climate crisis. When Hurricane Harvey hit in August 2017, flood waters swallowed de Leon's father's house up to its roof. In February 2021, when Winter Storm Uri knocked out power across the state, de Leon's family huddled in the dark, with candles as their only source of light and warmth; it was so cold de Leon found it unbearable simply to move. In more ways than one, Texas is ground zero for the climate emergency. The state is home to many of the biggest names in fossil fuels, corporations that have helped power the nation and world for decades - but have also knowingly lied about the dangers of burning those fossil fuels. Now, along with supercharged hurricanes, the climate crisis threatens Texans with extreme heat, drought, wildfires and sea-level rise on the Gulf coast. The non-profit Trust for America's Health rates Texas among the states that are simultaneously most vulnerable to climate effects and the least prepared. In 2021 polling by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, 65% of Texans said they are worried about global warming - on par with the nationwide average - and clear majorities said they want politicians to do more about it. But Texas is also the site of broadscale voter suppression efforts, which contribute to leaders being unresponsive to voters' concerns, experts and advocates say. 'If the attitudes of our communities were proportionally represented, I think we would see more climate action,' said de Leon, who serves as policy and advocacy manager for MOVE Texas, a nonpartisan grassroots group that specializes in voter mobilization. 'We're not seeing that, though, and the reason, in part, is we have this democracy problem.' Harvey was responsible for 103 deaths in Texas, and Uri killed 246, according to official figures, though for Uri the actual toll was probably higher. Today, de Leon said, the psychological impact of those storms is unmistakable. When it rains, many in his community are afraid to go outside. This past winter, a forecasted cold front prompted anxiety and panic buying in stores. The weather passed without incident, but to de Leon it was a grim sign of the times. 'If there's a natural disaster now, the mindset is you're on your own,' he said. 'Help isn't going to come. That's how little faith we have that our public officials will keep us safe.' An anti-climate tack might not surprise in a state where Republicans boast the governorship, both US senate seats, and significant majorities in the state house and senate - not to mention the fossil fuel ties that permeate the halls of power in Austin. 'There are politicians in Texas who would consider climate action an explicit threat to the industry they're in government to promote,' said Adrian Shelley, who directs the Texas office of Public Citizen, a non-profit consumer advocacy group. But party control and fossil fuels' influence alone don't explain the Lone Star state's slow roll on climate. Due to partisan gerrymandering, political representation at both the state and federal level is skewed away from Democrats, who more often favor climate action. In the 2020 general election, Republican congressional candidates received 53% of the popular vote - yet they were awarded 64% of seats, accounting for 23 of Texas's 36-member congressional delegation in Washington. That said, many Republican voters in Texas also favor climate action. In detailed polling by Climate Nexus, 71% of Texans this February said a complete transition to clean, renewable energy should be a 'top' or 'important' priority for the state. Lawmakers, meanwhile, routinely pass measures to stymie efforts by cities and other municipalities wanting to make their own climate progress; one 2021 law effectively banned local governments from favoring clean energy use to lower emissions. Gerrymandering 'reduces competition in elections and basically removes incentives for legislators to be responsive to the public', said Samuel Wang, who directs the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, a nonpartisan research group. The project's 'Redistricting Report Cards' give Texas's congressional and state senate maps 'F' grades, indicating the maps are among the least fair nationwide. Gerrymandering also means the 'decisive election,' Wang said, is often not the general election but the party primary. Although many Republican voters might favor climate action, it's typically not their top voting issue. Amid America's polarized political landscape, voters tend to back their preferred party, regardless of the candidate, so even primary winners hostile to climate action can count on voters who would otherwise favor it. 'Non-competitive primaries have a strong tendency to remove climate from the conversation,' Wang said. Due to population growth, Texas enters the 2022 election cycle with two new congressional seats (making for a total of 38). People of color, especially Latinos, accounted for 95% of growth - yet the new congressional map includes fewer districts where non-white voters 'can realistically sway election outcomes', according to The Texas Tribune. Republican lawmakers who drew the state's maps insist race wasn't a factor. But Miguel Rivera, voting rights coordinator at the Texas Civil Rights Project, says the maps' lines tell a different story. He says they elaborately contort to 'crack' up or 'pack' in communities of color. 'The Texas lawmakers who voted in favor of [these maps] are giving Texans a very clear message that they're willing to put their own agendas ahead of the will of the people,' Rivera said. An iron-clad rule of the climate crisis is that it weighs disproportionately on communities of color, who in the US are more likely to reside in disaster-prone areas and often, because the same communities are disproportionately poor, last in line for help when disaster does strike. De Leon, the MOVE Texas activist, lives in Texas's 29th congressional district, whose lines cut a jagged, reverse-C around Houston's east side - and, in doing so, pack in much of the area's Latino population. Five years on, Hurricane Harvey damage remains plain to see in parts of the district, de Leon said, with some families and businesses still awaiting promised aid that was never delivered. The district is also home to a legion of petrochemical facilities and the Port of Houston, where fossil fuels are exported from Texas. This means area residents must also contend with the public health consequences of fossil fuels: cancer, respiratory illness, cardiovascular disease, and more. Texas has also pushed through other voting policies that critics say are clearly intended to limit the franchise for minority voters. Last year, citing widely debunked claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election, Texas Republicans passed an expansive elections bill that bans drive-thru voting, curtails early voting in diverse communities (while expanding it in smaller, Republican-leaning areas), empowers partisan 'poll watchers', and criminalizes various forms of voter assistance that can be critical in helping some voters to the polls, among other measures. Many of the law's provisions roll back policies meant to make voting safe and accessible amid the coronavirus pandemic, which were implemented in 2020 with particular effectiveness in Houston's diverse Harris county. Partisan attacks on voting and other democratic norms stand in the way of needed climate action all over the country, not just in Texas. 'We often differentiate our ideas about democracy and climate, but they're not separate issues,' said Diana Faraj, voting rights program manager at the League for Conservation Voters. 'The overwhelming majority of Americans want free and fair elections that represent their interests. They also want [a safe climate]. So, the suppression of votes both undercuts their power and perpetuates environmental harm.' In the absence of federal legislation to take on gerrymandering and other voter suppression tactics, some states have instituted independent redistricting commissions to help quell overly partisan election outcomes. In Texas, though, electoral maps remain firmly in the grip of the legislature. Numerous groups, including the Texas Civil Rights Project and the US Department of Justice, have filed legal challenges to allegedly discriminatory aspects of the state's voting laws. Another spate of lawsuits, including from Public Citizen, target the state's climate and energy policies. Whether these suits will be successful, and how quickly, is unclear. In the meantime, groups are mobilizing to educate and organize around these issues. De Leon's MOVE Texas is among them. On a given day, MOVE Texas activists are registering voters across the state and engaging with local leaders to build out climate plans, despite difficulties imposed from Austin. But de Leon worries: 'It gets to the point where you can't fully out-organize this,' he said. 'We can keep coming up with new ways to fight this battle, but the challenge is getting steeper and steeper every time.'", "9f83f568ce82659250de43b31a5310829452eca66896e7c684299441": "'Children pick up whether someone cares about them even if they don't speak the language,' says Kulvarn Atwal, a headteacher in east London. Atwal, who has plenty of experience of welcoming children who are refugees from conflict, is preparing for the arrival of new pupils from Ukraine. Children connect with each other much faster than adults do, he says. 'Sometimes we look at children through the eyes of adults, but they don't see what adults see. They haven't developed discriminatory biases so they just dive straight in.' As the summer term begins, many schools are preparing to welcome children who have fled Ukraine after the Russian invasion. For some schools, particularly in rural areas, it could be their first experience of teaching refugees. Atwal has told his local council he will take 'as many Ukrainian children as possible', to Uphall primary, his school in Ilford, where 60 languages are spoken, to make use of the school's experience. He says he also wanted 'to send an important message to our children that we are doing something'. For children who arrive speaking no English, often after traumatic experiences, starting a new school in a new country is daunting. But they typically go on to thrive. The education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, himself arrived aged nine from Iraq speaking no English. How do teachers manage to help such children to adapt and make progress? 'As soon as they get here, we give them a buddy, another student, who supports them all day long,' says Atwal. 'Everyone wants to volunteer. If they walk into a classroom and children are fighting to look after them; they love that.' Uphall employs an emotional literacy adviser, who helps children who may have suffered trauma. If a child does not speak much English the adviser will use picture cards showing an angry face and ask: 'Do you ever feel like this?' Atwal emphasises that each child needs to be treated as an individual. Some will be very quiet at first, taking it all in, 'but that doesn't mean they don't feel safe'. 'Many children who have fled a country come from very educated backgrounds,' he says. 'We see groups of refugees in the press, but every child has their own story.' In January, a month before the invasion of Ukraine, Atwal heard about a large number of refugee children housed in a bed and breakfast nearby. He offered them places and invited the families in to meet him. They did not speak English and were 'clearly traumatised' by what they had experienced. Some of the parents were disabled as a result of war. With no access to public funds, none could afford bus fares to school. For most of these uprooted families Atwal says the practical challenges of getting their children to school each day were too much. But a handful of children joined, and he says they have settled in happily. Teachers preparing to welcome new Ukrainian children are sharing advice on social media, and requests for help from small charities, like the Schools of Sanctuary network, are mushrooming. Oliver Wilson, head of Woodhouse primary school, part of the University of Wolverhampton multi-academy trust, says: 'The biggest thing is the warm welcome.' Wilson's school has enrolled children who have fled Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran and the Congo. Before the children start, he invites the family to come into school to meet him and his team. An interpreter will be there to help, often a member of a family already at the school. Wilson is always mindful the new family may have had 'a horrific journey' and 'witnessed terrible things'. A small thing like making sure to smile can help, he says.  Before a new refugee joined recently, a child from the same country knocked on his door and asked if she could show her around. 'Her whole family offered support, giving a great welcome, because they knew what it felt like to be new,' Wilson says. The school has an expert English as an additional language [EAL] teacher, something many schools now lack because of funding cuts in the past 10 years. One thing that works well is using the doll's house: a chance to learn practical everyday words by pointing at objects and playing. Wilson says: 'You can't just put them in a class in a totally new system and language and expect them to flourish. We give them time, adult conversation and the opportunity to develop confidence.' Wilson says once the children have been given time to settle, start to learn the language and begin to overcome challenges such as bereavement or PTSD, they 'can really fly academically'. But he says what matters most is that they find school a safe and welcoming place. In March, a video of an entire Italian school clapping as their two new Ukrainian classmates arrived went viral on social media, with many people saying it moved them to tears. But Megan Greenwood, coordinator for the Schools of Sanctuary programme, urges caution. 'A big fanfare welcome is not necessarily going to be helpful for someone who is very new to the country and feeling unsettled.' Her advice: 'Don't bring a newly arrived child on to stage in assembly.' She suggests smaller, 'less conspicuous' gestures, such as putting up signs written by classmates in Ukrainian. The Schools of Sanctuary scheme has recognised 341 nurseries, schools and sixth forms in the UK for supporting children who have had to flee and educating others about their situation. Greenwood describes one student arriving at a sixth form college recently during a day of solidarity for Ukraine. 'They didn't announce that he had come from there, but he was really touched when he turned up and there were yellow and blue flags everywhere.' Helen Giblett, head of Archbishop Benson primary school in Truro, says her pupils have each planted a sunflower, Ukraine's national flower, to show the Ukrainian children joining the school that they are 'ready to welcome and support them'. The school took in Syrian refugees a few years ago and Giblett says some of those children are now raising issues to do with their experience because the war in Ukraine has brought them to the fore. 'We focus on listening,' she says. 'Often children won't even realise they are receiving special support, which might be through drawing or talking.' Greenwood says these children need a 'safe person' on the staff who they can always turn to, as well as a safe space in which to decompress. Some schools have a teacher who leads on refugee support. 'If a child puts up their hand in class and says they want to see this teacher, all members of staff understand what that means,' Greenwood says. Lack of English is one of the most obvious obstacles. The Bell Foundation, a language education charity, runs webinars on welcoming refugees and is offering training and free resources to schools taking Ukrainians. Silvana Richardson, the charity's strategic education adviser, says children need English language support for six years. 'It should be in the classroom as much as possible, so children socialise with their peers.' She advises schools to teach children some basic emotional language early on, 'so that they can tell someone when they are tired, sad or need some time out'. Jasmine Kay, a year 6 teacher at Wood Ley primary school, Stowmarket, which has just applied to become the first sanctuary school in Suffolk, says that being immersed in a new language can be exhausting. 'Allowing brain breaks and additional time to play and relax can be essential.' Kay's pupils recently made cards for local refugee families. She points out that welcoming new children offers a chance for schools to talk about migration and why diversity is a strength, as well as making pupils consider how they would feel if they had been the ones forced to flee. 'We should show solidarity to our fellow human beings and treat them as we would like to be treated if the roles were reversed,' she says.", "461f7a2c1735584ae29ad876dd840b559b382d6a1011e6bce524a158": "", "0e1b383bc62a1307833bee7a2a88301461f718688b82bfecab70f0bc": "A Russian minister refused to rule out Moldova's breakaway region Transnistria being drawn into the Ukraine war, in a potential escalation of the conflict to another European country. The deputy foreign minister, Andrey Rudenko, said on Tuesday said Moscow 'was concerned' over the string of recent explosions in Transnistria, saying Russia 'would like to avoid a scenario' in which Transnistria would be dragged into the war. Speaking to journalists in Moscow, Rudenko said the 'situation with the explosions' in the region indicated that 'certain forces' behind the attacks were interested in creating 'another hotbed of tension in Europe' - a reference to two episodes of violence reported in the enclave in as many days. 'An investigation will be carried out accordingly, and we hope that the reasons will be established and those responsible will be punished,' RIA Novosti cited Rudenko as saying. Transnistria, which is controlled by pro-Russian separatists and permanently hosts 1,500 Russian troops as well as a large arms depot, borders western Ukraine. Rudenko's statements came after Moldova's president, Maia Sandu, convened a meeting of her security council on Tuesday following the two incidents. On Tuesday morning, local authorities said two antennas that carried Russian radio broadcasts were blown up, while on Monday unknown attackers shelled the region's state security ministry in Tiraspol with a grenade launcher. After the security council meeting, Sandu said certain unnamed 'forces inside Transnistria' were in 'favour of war' and were interested in destabilising the situation in the region. Russian president Vladimir Putin's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, earlier on Tuesday told journalists that he was 'concerned' about the news that came out of Transnistria, while the leader of the self-proclaimed republic in Donetsk, Denis Pushilin, told the RIA Novosti that Moscow should 'take into account what is happening in Transnistria' when planning the next stage of its military campaign. Last week, a senior Russian commander said the goal of Russia's new offensive was to seize control of southern Ukraine and to gain access to Transnistria, first creating worries that the small east European country could become a new flashpoint in rising tensions between Moscow and the west. Commenting on the explosion at the security ministry, the Moldovan government said the blast had been aimed at 'creating pretexts for straining the security situation' in the breakaway region. Officials in Transnistria on Tuesday announced a number of new security measures, further raising concerns about a possible escalation in the breakaway state. Measures included the instalment of military checkpoints at the entrances to the cities of the region and the cancellation of the annual 9 May victory day parade. Bob Deen, an expert on Moldova and a senior research fellow at the Clingendael Institute thinktank, said it was difficult to know whether the recent incidents were a false-flag operation by Russia or genuine acts of sabotage by anti-Russian groups. But he said recent Russian rhetoric pointed to some of the long-term goals Russia had in mind for Transnistria. 'We have seen that the topic of Transnistria is becoming discussed more openly in the Russian public domain. Russian recent statements could be an indication of the ambitions Moscow has there.' According to Deen, it was unlikely that Russian forces would be able to stage an offensive toward the border with Moldova, given that Moscow was engaged in heavy fighting in the eastern Donbas region. To get to Transnistria, Moscow would need to stage an offensive toward Odesa, which has been hindered by the recent sinking of the Moskva cruiser, which forced Russian warships to move further away from Ukraine's coast. Deen was also sceptical that Transnistria's own forces, which number about 7,500 troops, would be used in an attack on Ukraine from its western border. 'There is little appetite to fight in Ukraine among the Transnistrian troops as well as the general population in the region, many of whom are leaving towards Moldova to escape any potential violence.' 'Similarly to Belarus, the region does not want to be fully dragged into this war,' he said, adding that the recent rhetoric by Moscow may be a ploy to get Ukraine to pull troops away from the Donbas towards its western border. With Russian backing, Transnistria fought a war against Moldova in the early 1990s that left the territory with de facto independence and a permanent Russian garrison. Russian state media - widely available in Transnistria - have played a significant role in cementing pro-Russian attitudes in the enclave as Moldova has shifted towards the west under the leadership of its liberal president. Last week, Sandu signed into law a bill banning the orange and black striped ribbons of Saint George, which enjoy wide popularity in Russia as a way to show public support for the government and the military, a move that angered Russian officials. In the same bill, Sandu banned the prowar signs 'Z' and 'V', first used by the Russian armed forces.", "13edadbb77618b141ef2d07882c3385ec755be5ef76f79a2a526d31c": "", "72ecff407f1ffd2c63e209af26d59652e03a75485f064f13ef332363": "The first body arrived in late February, a few days after the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. The next day, two more. By the beginning of March, the morgue, on the outskirts of Kyiv, had no more space for the dead who, every day, arrived by the dozen from the cities of Bucha and Borodyanka - at the time occupied by the Russian forces. When Moscow's withdrawal from the areas north of the capital early in April unveiled the brutality of mass graves, with hundreds of civilian corpses buried in residential districts, every morgue in the Kyiv region was already at breaking point. Today, more than two months after the war began, bodies are being piled in refrigerated trucks in front of the morgues, as authorities struggle to handle the number of dead. 'We weren't prepared for this,' said a coroner from a village a few kilometres from the capital. 'No one would ever have imagined that it would come to this.' Survivors of Bucha, Borodyanka, Irpin and Hostomel, where Russians are accused of war crimes against civilians, did not stop to celebrate their liberation, starting immediately instead to count and identify their dead. Each day, dozens of people now approach the refrigerated trucks to put the names of their loved ones to the bodies closed in black bags and piled one on top of the other. 'Up to Sunday, 1,123 bodies were recovered in the Kyiv region alone, with 35 children among them,' said Oleh Tkalenko, a senior prosecutor for the Kyiv region. 'These are the bodies that we have dug out from mass graves or that we have found on the streets. We have found brutalised people. All 1,123 cases are being documented and examined by detectives. And, every day, we continue to uncover more bodies. I can't give any more precise information because there are thousands of reports being written.' Vladyslav Perovskyi, a Ukrainian forensic doctor who, with a team of coroners, has carried out dozens of autopsies on people from Bucha, Irpin and Borodyanka who died during Russia's month-long occupation of the area, explains that the process of identifying corpses is complex, given the state of decomposition of the bodies found in the mass graves and the high level of brutalisation perpetrated on the victims, even after they were killed. He tells of people killed and then crushed by tanks. 'There are many burnt and disfigured bodies that are just impossible to identify,' he said. 'The face could be smashed into pieces. You can't put it back together. Sometimes, there's no head at all.' His team, which operates in a morgue that cannot be identified for security reasons, has been examining about 15 bodies a day, many of them mutilated. An elderly couple approaches the rear doors of the vehicle. Through tears, they communicate the identity of the victim to the men standing inside the trailer, in the midst of no less than 30 bodies. He was their son, who was serving in the civil resistance. The couple say he was allegedly betrayed by a woman when Russian soldiers occupied their town on the outskirts of the capital and were hunting down Ukrainian fighters and former soldiers who had taken part in the war in Donbas. Their son was one of them. The Russians captured him, tortured him, broke his arms and legs and put a plastic bag over his head. Then they shot him dead in the head and threw his body on the side of the road. His corpse remained there, for days, until it was found by volunteers. When the men inside the vehicle show her the body of her son, the woman bursts into inconsolable cries and screams, as she curses the Russian soldiers, wishing them the same fate. A tattoo on his shoulder is the only identifying sign on an almost completely unrecognisable body, marked by decomposition and brutalisation. When the woman sees it, she nods and is accompanied to the car, in tears. Before his body can be buried, however, it will first have to be examined by Perovskyi's team, who, alongside 18 experts from the forensic department of France's national gendarmerie, have started documenting the terror inflicted on civilians during the month-long occupation. 'We are seeing a lot of mutilated bodies,' said Perovskyi. 'A lot of them had their hands tied behind their backs and shots in the back of their heads. There were also cases with automatic gunfire, like six to eight holes on the back of victims. And we have several cases of cluster bombs' elements embedded in the bodies of the victims.' Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians and has said Ukrainian and western allegations of war crimes are concocted. Evidence of death and destruction in the areas occupied by Moscow's troops seems to suggest otherwise.", "12be4d53ae48705afa45e4173b073e4c5edcafe952ac0ec9ffd4aea1": "For Dr Dmytro*, who has worked as a cardiologist in Lviv for 13 years, few crosses are harder to bear than the death of a child - the loss of a patient whose life still lay before them - even when he knows there is nothing more he could have done. But while all children's deaths weigh heavily on his mind, the avoidable loss of Andriy, a one-week-old baby who died because of a shortage of X-ray machines, is one Dmytro still struggles to reconcile. Andriy was born in Lviv in March with congenital heart disease, and urgently needed an angiogram, a specialist X-ray that allows a doctor to see a patient's blood vessels. But with only one angiography machine shared between several hospitals in Lviv, and as the western Ukrainian city copes with an influx of people fleeing Russian attacks in the east and around Kyiv, waiting times for specialist medical equipment have risen. In Andriy's case, the delay was fatal. 'It destroyed me as a doctor,' Dmytro says. 'He should have lived; it wasn't the condition that killed him. This is a kid who should go to school, make friends, play football. And it destroys you, especially when you understand what could have solved this problem - and that's another angiography machine.' According to UN agency the International Organization for Migration, more than 7.1 million people have been internally displaced in Ukraine since Russia invaded six weeks ago, and hundreds of thousands have fled to the relative safety of western Ukraine, which has so far been spared the brunt of the violence. The result is that hospitals in Lviv - the largest city in the region and its unofficial capital - are under increasing strain as they become medical hubs for the entire country. As well as serving the everyday needs of its growing population and those wounded in fighting elsewhere, Lviv's hospitals have also absorbed patients with chronic and complex conditions who have been transferred from hospitals in frontline cities such as Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol. Hospitals in those cities have also been directly targeted. For this reason hospitals in this article cannot be named ; doctors are also referred to by their first names only for security. And as Russia marked the start of its renewed eastern offensive with missile strikes that also targeted infrastructure in western Ukraine, there are fears the region could soon be further overwhelmed with its own casualties of war. As medical departments shut down in the east, many doctors also moved west, bolstering the workforce in Lviv. But equipment was left behind or destroyed, and while Lviv's hospitals have enough doctors to treat the new patients, in some cases they are finding themselves without the means to do so. Dr Zoryana, who works at a children's hospital in Lviv, says: 'Patients with chronic conditions, congenital malformations, cardiac surgery patients, neurosurgery patients, injuries from war - all severe pathologies are now coming here, because we are now one of the only centres that can manage such patients.  'We lack particular supplies and equipment, because we are not used to having so many severe patients. And that's a real problem at the moment.' In Zoryana's hospital, for example, there is only one monitor to measure the vital signs of patients in intensive-care units (ICU). 'We have the doctors to do three major operations a day, but we cannot do that because we only have one monitor. So we are only doing one a day and then waiting until the child is quite stable to give that monitor to the next,' she says. As she talks outside the hospital, ambulances with Polish and British number plates arrive, full of privately donated medical supplies: bandages, morphine, saline kits, feeding tubes. Yet the more acute challenge is acquiring specialist equipment such as the angiography machine, which cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, that could have saved Andriy's life. 'Before the war, we performed around 30 angiography procedures each month, but in the past month, we had 66 patients,' says Dmytro. 'If the [operating] table is busy, heart attack or stroke patients have a much higher chance of dying or having neurological deficits ... An extra hour can increase the mortality risk by 20%.' Dr Denis, who fled his home in Dnipro and is now medical director of anaesthetics and intensive care at the children's hospital, a workplace that also doubles as his new home, says they need 'specialist equipment: ventilator units, ICU beds, syringe pumps, high-level monitoring systems, ECMO [life-support] machines.' But he adds that it is not just quantity, but quality, that can make the difference between life and death. Using old Soviet-era devices that were in storage can lead to missed diagnoses, riskier procedures and longer operating times. Ukraine's defence minister recently called on 'partnering states' to upgrade the country's Soviet-era weapons with modern ones used by Nato, in order to survive the new onslaughtin the east. 'If they will open the humanitarian corridors, we can't even imagine how many casualties we will take just from one city,' says Denis. 'What we ask from Nato is not soldiers - close the sky [to Russian warplanes] and give us modern ammunition, machinery and equipment. We have enough people ready to be deployed. And we have a lot of weapons, but from the Soviet Union. 'It's the same situation in hospitals. Give us modern equipment, and modern medical supplies. Our doctors are well trained, they can do a lot of high-level operations.' But for some doctors, the biggest challenge is wounds that Nato-provided equipment cannot heal. 'Every doctor must be a psychologist now,' says Dr Ivan, a fresh-faced graduate whose first day of work in the children's hospital was the day before war broke out. 'People are emotionally closed, like a shell,' he says. 'Maybe the worst thing is to see in people's eyes, children's eyes - nothing.' * Only first names have been used to protect the doctors' identities.

Officials removed Hirohito from the video after pressure from the Japanese government, which has imposed sanctions on Russia, provided $300m (PS235m) in loans for Ukraine and accepted hundreds of refugees. Japan's deputy chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihiko Isozaki, said Tokyo would continue to support Ukraine but Hirohito's inclusion in the video had been 'completely inappropriate'. The video, posted by the Ukrainian government on Twitter on 1 April, described Russia's invasion as 'contemporary ruscism' and included the three second world war figures above the message: 'Fascism and Nazism were defeated in 1945.' The decision to remove Hirohito's photo and apologise is seen as an attempt by Ukraine's government not to alienate Japan, an ally in its war against Russia. While Japan's wartime government was led by the then prime minister, Hideki Tojo, the conflict was fought in the name of Hirohito, who was revered as a living god until Japan's defeat in August 1945. His reign began in 1926 during Japan's colonial rule over the Korean peninsula and included all of the Pacific war's key developments, from the attack on Pearl Harbor to Japan's surrender after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Fearing political instability and the influence of communism, the postwar US occupation forces allowed Hirohito to remain on the chrysanthemum throne but stripped him of his divine status, making him a symbol of the unity of the Japanese people instead. His son, Akihito, who ascended the throne after his father's death in 1989, spent much of his reign attempting to repair relations with Japan's former victims. Historians remain divided over how big a role Hirohito played in decision-making during the war. Japanese conservatives are sensitive to any association made between Hirohito - who is posthumously known as the Emperor Showa - and wartime atrocities committed by imperial Japan, a member of the Axis powers coalition along with Nazi Germany and fascist Italy. 'Portraying Hitler, Mussolini and Emperor Showa in the same context is completely inappropriate,' Isozaki told reporters. 'It was extremely regrettable.' The Ukrainian government removed Hirohito's image from the video and tweeted its 'sincere apologies for making this mistake', adding that it had 'no intention to offend the friendly people of Japan'. The Ukrainian ambassador to Japan, Sergiy Korsunsky, also apologised in a tweet, saying the creator of the video 'lacked an understanding of history'. Some Japanese Twitter users continued to criticise the original video and called on their government to withdraw its support for Ukraine. Others said it would have been more appropriate to have used a photo of Tojo, who was hanged as a war criminal in 1948. He is honoured, along with other Japanese war dead, at Yasukuni shrine, where pilgrimages by conservative Japanese politicians have drawn criticism from China and South Korea. Japan's former prime minister Shinzo Abe visited Yasukuni last week to mark the shrine's spring festival. The current prime minister, Fumio Kishida, sent a ritual offering but did not attend in person.", "3050cdc1bd59395b003f5ab44570f31f3a8a1e6b69b593f5c49c3552": "A man with learning difficulties has been executed in Singapore for attempting to smuggle a small amount of heroin, despite repeated pleas for his life to be spared, in a case campaigners have described as a 'tragic miscarriage of justice'. Nagaenthran K Dharmalingam, a Malaysian national, was arrested in 2009, aged 21, for attempting to carry 43g of heroin - about three tablespoons - into Singapore. He was sentenced to death the following year, and then spent more than a decade on death row. His sentence horrified international rights groups, and prompted an outcry around the world, from EU representatives and UN experts, to the billionaire Richard Branson and actor and broadcaster Stephen Fry. Within Singapore, where support for the death penalty is high, the handling of his case has also prompted some to question the city state's approach to drugs-related crimes. Nagaenthran had said he was coerced into carrying the package and did not know what was inside. His supporters say Nagaenthran had an IQ of 69, a level recognised as indicating a learning disability, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but that neither the investigation nor trial made any specific disability-related accommodations. Singapore's chief justice, Sundaresh Menon, has previously stated that Nagaenthran had been 'afforded due process'. Singapore's government claims its severe drugs laws, including the death penalty, are the most effective deterrent against crime. In 2009, Nagaenthran was working as a welder in Johor Bahru in Malaysia, and desperately trying to find extra money to support his father, who was due to have a heart operation. Nagaenthran approached a man to ask for a loan of roughly PS100, campaigners say, and was subsequently coerced into smuggling the package. His family have described him as sweet and caring but easily led and vulnerable. On Monday, hundreds of people in Singapore held a candlelight vigil at a park to protest against the planned execution. Nagaenthran's mother, Panchalai Supermaniam, filed a last-ditch legal challenge on Tuesday, seeking to halt the execution, but it was refused. Her motion argued that Nagaenthran may not have received a fair trial because the chief justice, who presided over his previous failed appeals, was attorney general at the time he was convicted in 2010, creating a potential conflict of interest. The court ruled on Tuesday that the motion was 'devoid of merit'. Afterwards, Nagaenthran asked the court for permission to hold his family's hands as a 'final wish'. He was allowed to spend two hours with relatives in the supreme court building. His mother had warned previously that his mental state had deteriorated during his time on death row, where he was kept in solitary confinement, and that he was at times incoherent. He did not seem to understand that he would be hanged, she said in a letter to Singapore's president, Halimah Yacob, in December. Instead, he would talk about going home and eating his mother's cooking. Maya Foa, the director of Reprieve, which campaigns against the death penalty, said Nagaenthran Dharmalingam's name would go down in history as 'the victim of a tragic miscarriage of justice'. 'From rushed hearings to intimidation of Nagen's lawyers, this case has laid bare Singaporean authorities' hollow claims about affording due process. But this is a watershed moment. With Nagen's plight igniting unprecedented protests in the country calling for abolition of the death penalty, it's clear the tide is turning in Singapore. 'Capital punishment in Singapore disproportionately targets drug mules rather than the drug lords that traffic or manipulate them. Most of its victims are, like Nagen, poor, vulnerable and from marginalised communities. This is a broken system,' said Foa. On Wednesday morning, Nagaenthran's brother Navin Kumar, 22, told Reuters by telephone the execution had been carried out. The funeral would be held in the town of Ipoh in Malaysia, he said. In a statement prior to Nagaenthran's execution, UN human rights spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani expressed deep concern at the 'rapid rise' in the number of execution notices issued this year in Singapore, mainly for drug-related offences. Last month, after a pause of more than two years in carrying out executions, Singapore executed Abdul Kahar bin Othman, who was convicted of drug-related offences.

A senior Iranian government source said the money was blocked in Oman and the problem was not with the UK government. One report said only PS1m had been transferred to Tehran. The UK made it a condition that the money would be used only for humanitarian purposes, but this condition was not repeated in a statement at the time by the Iranian government. Oman acted as a mediator in the talks that led to the transfer of the longstanding debt at the time of the release of the two UK detainees on 17 March. Both sides maintained that the payment of the 40-year-old debt and the release were not linked, but many said this was a diplomatic fiction. The UK refused to comment directly on Iranian media reports but pointed to previous UK and Iranian government statements that the debt had been paid with accrued interest. Questioned by the Iranian newspaper Entekhab, Mahmoud Abbaszadeh Meshkini, the spokesperson for the Iranian parliament's national security and foreign policy commission, said the money was blocked. 'We are working with the countries of the region in some way, and some neighbouring countries are consulting and mediating in receiving our demands,' he said. He said it was important that the blocked money was released. The extent of the hold-up is not clear and it is unknown whether it is due to a banking problem in Oman or another issue, such as the limits set on the use of the money by the British. The Foreign Office has stressed that the payment 'was made in full compliance with UK and international sanctions and all legal obligations'. The Iranian government also said at the time that it 'had full authority and freedom on how to spend its financial resources'. There had been speculation that the UK may be withholding full release of the funds because it believes Iran has not kept its side of the negotiated bargain that should have allowed a third British-Iranian, Morad Tahbaz, indefinite leave to be on furlough at his family home in Tehran, rather than requiring him to stay in prison. But the UK has always said there is no link between the debt and the release of the detainees, so it would be difficult for London to explicitly make such a link now. Tabhaz went on a nine-day hunger strike after his return to jail, but his future seems tied up with stalled wider talks about the revival of the Iran nuclear deal in Vienna. Tabhaz also has US citizenship and the Iranians appeared unwilling to release him as part of the deal that led to the release of Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Ashoori. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, thought that as a compromise she had reached an understanding that Tabhaz, an environmentalist arrested in January 2018 and jailed for 10 years, would be allowed out of jail on furlough. However, he was returned to jail after only two days on release. The Iranians said there may have been a misunderstanding within his family. The UK foreign affairs select committee is due to hold an inquiry into how the UK handled the detainees' case, but it is not yet clear how much it will examine the issue of state hostage-taking in general or the specific handling of past consular cases by ministers and officials. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was detained in Iran for six years. Ashoori was held in Evin prison for nearly five years. Both had been found guilty of spying by the Iranian revolutionary courts, charges they denied.", "1d48ed3b3d0e80f236ca7a2de9d1d463d0005ead54091b5f2d2c5b07": "A mysterious liver disease that has infected children in a dozen countries around the world has reached Asia, with a case reported in Japan. The case in Japan of acute hepatitis - or inflammation of the liver - of unknown origin was flagged by local authorities on 21 April in a child who had tested negative for adenovirus - a possible cause being investigated worldwide - and Covid-19. The patient had not had a liver transplant, the health ministry said on Monday, without giving further details. Canada's Public Health Agency said on Tuesday it was investigating reports of severe acute hepatitis of unknown origin in young children. It did not reveal the number of cases or their location. So far across the world, 190 mystery cases of acute hepatitis in children have been reported, with 140 of them in Europe, mostly in the UK (110 cases). Further cases have been found in Israel and in the United States. Seventeen children became so sick they needed liver transplants. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a nationwide health alert last week that the first US cases were identified in October in Alabama. The first UK cases were recorded in January. On Saturday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said at least one death had been reported in connection the outbreak. The UN health agency said the cases were reported in children aged between one month and 16 years. The WHO did not say in which country the death occurred. Hepatitis is usually caused by one of several contagious hepatitis viruses, but these have not been found in the affected children. Jaundice, diarrhoea and abdominal pain are among reported symptoms. One theory being investigated by the UK Health Security Agency is that a lack of exposure to the common adenovirus - which usually causes stomach upsets and colds - during the coronavirus pandemic has led to more severe illness among children. Of 53 cases tested in the UK, 40 (75%) showed signs of adenovirus infection. Public Health Scotland's director, Jim McMenamin, told Reuters that work was under way to understand if an adenovirus has mutated to cause more severe disease, or if it could be causing the problems 'in tandem' with another virus, including possibly Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. UK officials said there was 'no link' between the cases and the Covid-19 vaccine, because none of the children affected by hepatitis had received a jab. Andrea Ammon, director at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in Stockholm, said: 'So far there is no connection between the cases and no association to travel.' The disease appeared in previously healthy children, Ammon said.", "4532f084703bc9abf5fdc6883552c8172c58e2c9692e8f68b536f024": "Aung San Suu Kyi has been sentenced to five years in prison after she was found guilty of corruption by a court in military-controlled Myanmar, the latest in a series of legal cases condemned as an attempt to remove her as a political threat. Myanmar's former leader, 76, has been detained since a military coup in February last year plunged the country into a political crisis and escalating conflict. Since then, she has been charged with at least 18 offences, ranging from election fraud to violating the Official Secrets Act. The various charges carry maximum sentences that could lead to Aung San Suu Kyi spending the rest of her life in detention. In the latest case, she was accused of accepting 11.4kg (402 oz) of gold bars and cash payments totalling US$600,000 from the former Yangon chief minister Phyo Min Thein. Her legal team have rejected the charges as absurd, while rights groups have described them as a clear attempt to remove Aung San Suu Kyi from politics. Phil Robertson, Deputy Asia Director, Human Rights Watch, called the corruption allegations as 'bogus'. 'The days of Aung San Suu Kyi as a free woman are effectively over. Myanmar's junta and the country's kangaroo courts are walking in lockstep to put Aung San Suu Kyi away for what could ultimately be the equivalent of a life sentence, given her advanced age,' Robertson said. 'Destroying popular democracy in Myanmar also means getting rid of Aung San Suu Kyi, and the junta is leaving nothing to chance,' he added. The military has faced strong opposition to its rule, including both peaceful pro-democracy protest movements, and an armed resistance, with civilians taking up arms in response to military attacks. The junta has used relentless violence to assert its control, prompting the UN to warn such abuses may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, citing the bombardment of populated areas with airstrikes, as well as reports of mass killings of civilians, and torture. It is not known where Aung San Suu Kyi is being held. She has not been seen in public since the coup, and trials have taken place in a closed court, with her legal representatives banned from talking to the media. Last month, the independent media outlet Myanmar Now reported a rare message from the ousted leader, relayed through an anonymous source, in which she urged the public to stay united. The source told the outlet: 'She said today that everyone needs to stay united and hold discussions on different views. If they still aren't able to open dialogues now, she said to wait patiently until it is possible to do so.' Aung San Suu Kyi is one of more than 10,300 people are currently in detention, according to estimates by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, an advocacy group that tracks arrests and killings. Among those arrested are members of Aung San Suu Kyi's party, National League for Democracy, as well as anyone suspected of opposing the military - from writers and intellectuals, to public sector workers who refuse to work in junta-controlled departments. According to AAPP, 100 people have been sentenced to death, including 57 adults and two children who are currently in prison. Others have been sentenced in absentia.", "f867cf0a60527b53992ecb33f6dd168675cce6834e46b2cc12582f2e": "Investors have wiped $126bn (PS100bn) off Tesla's value amid concern that Elon Musk may have to sell shares in the electric carmaker to fund his personal contribution to his $44bn acquisition of Twitter. Tesla stock has been targeted despite the company not being involved in the bid but Musk, its chief executive and largest shareholder, is part-funding the Twitter deal with $21bn of his own equity and a further $12.5bn loan secured against his Tesla stake. The 12.2% drop in Tesla's shares on Tuesday equated to a $21bn drop in the value of his Tesla stake, equal to the cash stake he committed to the Twitter deal. Dan Ives, an analyst at the financial firm Wedbush Securities, said worries about upcoming stock sales by Musk and the possibility he is becoming distracted by the Twitter venture are weighing on the electric carmaker's shares. 'This [is] causing a bear festival on the name,' he said. Ed Moya, an analyst at the online trading platform Oanda, said: 'If Tesla's share price continues to remain in freefall that will jeopardise his financing.' The share fall also took place against a backdrop of difficult trading for tech stocks. The Nasdaq closed at its lowest level since December 2020 on Tuesday, as investors worried about slowing global growth and more aggressive rate increases from the US Federal Reserve. Twitter's shares also slid on Tuesday, falling 3.9% to close at $49.68, even though Musk agreed to buy it on Monday for $54.20 a share in cash. The widening spread reflects investor concern that the precipitous decline in Tesla's shares, from which Musk derives the majority of his $239bn fortune, could lead the world's richest person to have second thoughts about the Twitter deal. As part of the Tesla deal, Musk also took out a $12.5bn margin loan tied to his Tesla stock. He had already borrowed against about half of his Tesla shares. The University of Maryland professor David Kirsch, whose research focuses on innovation and entrepreneurship, said investors started to worry about a 'cascade of margin calls' on Musk's loans.

But for many of the US's largest companies and their shareholders it has been a very different story. One widely accepted narrative holds that companies and consumers are sharing in inflationary pain, but a Guardian analysis of top corporations' financials and earnings calls reveals most are enjoying profit increases even as they pass on costs to customers, many of whom are struggling to afford gas, food, clothing, housing and other basics. The analysis of Securities and Exchange Commission filings for 100 US corporations found net profits up by a median of 49%, and in one case by as much as 111,000%. Those increases came as companies saddled customers with higher prices and all but ten executed massive stock buyback programs or bumped dividends to enrich investors. In earnings calls, executives detailed how even as demand and profits rose post-vaccine, they passed on most or all inflationary costs to customers via price increases, and some took the opportunity to add more on top. Margins - the share of sales converted into profits - also improved for the majority of the companies analyzed by the Guardian. Economists who reviewed the data say it's more evidence of a clear reality: Consumers are taking a financial hit as companies and shareholders profit or are largely shielded. 'It's obvious that corporations are trying to pass on any form of short-term pain they might be feeling ... and that's serving the top, wealthiest class instead of those in need of fair wages or products that are affordable,' said Krista Brown, a policy analyst with the American Economic Liberties Project. Media framing likely influences public perception. News reports of Hershey's multiple price hikes over the last year read like so many dire reports on inflation's pervasive toll. The company, which owns popular brands like Reese's, KitKat and Skinny Pop, has been cast as the 'latest victim of ever-increasing inflation'. But a closer look at the company's financials suggests a vastly different reality. Hershey's net profits spiked 62% between the fourth quarters in 2019 and 2021, its operating margin widened, and it recently rewarded shareholders with $200m in stock buybacks. Still, customers will pay even more for candy bars in 2022 as Hershey aims for even higher profits: 'Pricing will be an important lever for us this year and is expected to drive most of our growth,' CEO Michele Buck told investors. Similarly, a Kroger executive told investors in June, 'a little bit of inflation is always good for our business', while Hostess's CEO in March said rising prices across the economy 'helps' it profit. The pandemic, war, supply chain bottlenecks and pricing decisions made in corporate suites have created a 'smokescreen', said Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, which tracks companies' profits. That obscures questionable price increases, she added, and allows businesses to be portrayed as 'victims'. 'That gray, nebulous area is fertile ground for companies right now, and you hear about it in their earnings calls,' Owens said. 'Inflation itself is the opportunity.' The Guardian's findings are in line with recent US commerce department data that shows corporate profits rose 35% during the last year and are at their highest level since 1950. Inflation, meanwhile, rose to 8.5% year over year in March. The Guardian's analysis is the first to take a granular look at a cross-section of companies across a range of industries. It compared the most recent quarter's profits to the same quarter two years prior, pre-pandemic. Price increases were obtained by checking earnings reports, though those often lacked specifics. The data is not intended to be definitive, but does show how a wide sample of companies have raised prices even as profits jumped. In earnings call after earnings call, executives made no secret of their strategies. The analysis found commodity companies trading in oil, timber, rubber, meat, wheat, steel and mining recorded the highest profit increases, while restaurants and retailers saw comparatively lower improvements, or losses. Commodity price spikes reverberate down the supply chain, eventually hitting consumers, noted Martin Schmalz, an Oxford University economist. The Guardian's data, he added, objectively shows a massive 'transfer of wealth' from consumers, who pay higher prices, to shareholders and investment firms that reap the benefits. The potential consequences are enormous and global. Inflation may already have sealed Democrats' midterm fate, and in France, Marie Le Pen, a far-right candidate from a Holocaust-denying party, gained on her liberal opponent as she positioned herself as the 'pricing power' candidate taking on the 'oligarchy' and 'elitism'. But even as profits skyrocket, many have dismissed the idea they play a meaningful role in inflation, including Larry Summers, a former Obama adviser with clout in the Biden White House. He previously called profiteering claims 'business bashing' that are 'terrible economics'. A Hershey spokesperson stressed that its growth was driven in part by volume, and it would be re-investing much of its profits to meet growing demand: 'These investments are where we are making the biggest use of cash,' he said. Financial observers have varying takes on whether companies are 'profiteering' or 'price gouging', or simply profiting. George Pearkes, an analyst at Bespoke Investment, pointed to Caterpillar, which recorded a 958% profit increase driven by volume growth and price realization between 2019 and 2021's fourth quarters. Eliminating price increases may have dropped the company's 2021 quarter four operating profits slightly below the $1.3bn it made in 2020. 'This isn't price gouging ... and it shows pretty concretely that there's a lot of nuance here,' Pearkes said, adding profiteering is 'not the primary driver of inflation, nor the primary driver of corporate profits'. However, he added that it's reasonable to question whether Caterpillar should have passed on its cost increases. The company also spent $5bn on buybacks last year, and $1.3bn for a quarter of profits is still high, Brown noted, especially in the context of inflation eating into workers' wage gains. 'Companies have access to massive capital,' she said. 'They could have one or two years that are more painful - not even more painful, just less profitable for their investors, and they're choosing not to.' One industry that neatly illustrates how corporations have used the current imbalance of supply and demand to increase their profits is housing. In recent months, the white-hot market for newly built houses shut out many Americans as average sale prices shot above $500,000. The popular explanation: inflation, supply chain squeezes and building material costs. But another less publicized factor contributed. Two of the nation's largest builders, PulteGroup and Lennar, intentionally kept home starts low and took other steps seemingly designed to maintain high prices by restricting supply. '  We could sell another 1,000 homes in the quarter if we wanted to without too much effort. It just doesn't make sense to do that,' Lennar co-CEO Jon Jaffe told investors in an earnings call. Lennar's profits are up 78%, while PulteGroup's jumped 97%. Lennar didn't respond to a request for comment. A step up the supply chain, wood producer Boise Cascade saw profits spike more than 1,100%, which it largely attributed to 'unprecedented' pricing in 2021. Executives boasted that improved margins were only 'offset partially' by inflationary and supply chain costs. And at Home Depot and Lowe's, where profits are up 38% and by about $2bn, respectively, volume and pricing drove sales as customers paid four times more for lumber. Observers note a common thread along the supply chain: consolidation. By some estimates, Home Depot and Lowe's control about one-third of the home improvement market, and hold even more of consumer lumber. Lennar and PulteGroup control about 11% of the home building market, though that figure is probably much higher in many metro regions, and Boise Cascade controls about one-third of the plywood market, according to a Forest Economic Advisors analysis. 'Those who have market power can raise prices above what's considered fair market value,' Brown said. 'We're at a point in our market concentrations that we haven't seen ever before.' The influence of consolidation is pervasive. A Procter & Gamble executive noted to investors it and Kimberly Clark benefit from controlling 70% of the diaper market. It's what Owens called a 'concentration of necessities'. Reports say customers have 'shrugged off' diaper cost increases, but antitrust advocates note very limited alternatives exist for many consumers. After multiple price increases, Procter & Gamble's profits are up and Kimberly Clark's are down, though the latter expects to 'cover the majority of inflation with pricing' in 2022. Similarly, Hershey's 30 companies control at least 46% of the candy market. Prices on some of its products are probably up by double digits while the CPI index shows candy is up 7.6%. Concentration is particularly pronounced among commodity companies, a problem highlighted in the grain market. CPI data shows bread and cereal prices increased by 30% and 7% between 2019 and 2021's fourth quarters, while wheat skyrocketed to an all-time high in March as war largely eliminated Ukrainian and Russian crops. Meanwhile, four large grain producers control about 90% of the market. Among them are Archer Daniels Midland, whose profits jumped 55%, and Bunge, whose profits swung by about $280m. Three companies control 73% of the cereal market. That level of concentration breeds higher prices, said Alex Turnbull, a commodities analyst. 'When you go from 15 to 10 companies, not much changes,' he said. 'When you go from 10 to six, a lot changes. But when you go from six to four - it's a fix.' Depending on the material or good, some commodity prices are set by exchanges, which Pearkes noted largely eliminates some companies' pricing power. But commodity consolidation can open the door to another form of pricing power: boosting prices by keeping supply low. 'Price is set by supply and demand at some metals exchange, but what is the supply? That is what the companies determine, no?' Schmalz asked. Just as PulteGroup kept housing starts down, oil companies have kept production low while gas topped $7 a gallon in some regions. In earnings calls across the industry, oil executives like Diamondback Energy CEO Travis Stice have promised to keep production flat in the years ahead, 'putting returns and, therefore, shareholders first'. 'No one wants to see that shareholder return program put at risk with volume growth,' Stice said. Some companies are enacting price increases in a less direct manner: by eliminating lower-cost products. The CEO of Kohl's said in a previous interview the store was shifting its merchandise toward higher-end brands like PVH-owned Tommy Hilfiger, where profits are up 183%, because they're more profitable for Kohl's. Similarly, General Motors profits jumped 49% between the full years in 2019 and 2021 despite selling about a million fewer vehicles. The company said it focused on moving more expensive trucks and SUVs than in previous years, but it also raised prices - a Silverado can now cost over $5,000 more than it did in 2019. That includes two rounds of March price increases just weeks after GM announced record profits and margins. Such strategies further squeeze lower income consumers, said University of Massachusetts Amherst economist Isabella Weber. 'That's a general trend that can enhance price increases quite dramatically, especially with cars and groceries,' she said. Not everyone is raising prices. Arizona Iced Tea owner Don Vultaggio became a populist hero in April when he declared he'd rather take a hit than push prices above 99 cents: 'I don't want to do what the bread guys and the gas guys and everybody else is doing,' Vultaggio told the Los Angeles Times. But Arizona is a privately owned company that doesn't face shareholders' wrath. When Target and Walmart declined to pass all inflationary costs on to customers ahead of the holiday season, an investor revolt ensued, and their shares temporarily plummeted. 'Shareholders are not interested in seeing anyone be cautious with price increases, and in some cases they're saying 'let's throttle supply, let's see how far we can take this',' Owens said. The surge in pandemic profits has not gone unnoticed. A spate of Senate and House bills aim to rein in excessive profits, while Biden proposals and executive actions target stock buybacks and consolidation. Meanwhile, many consumer advocates and economists argue that enforcing antitrust laws already on the book, or strengthening them, could help reduce companies' pricing power. Others have argued for the implementation of very targeted price controls on essential items, like bread. In March, Senator Bernie Sanders began a push to bring back a windfall profit tax last used after the second world war, while Senator Elizabeth Warren introduced similar legislation that focused on oil companies' profits. 'The American people are sick and tired of the unprecedented corporate greed that exists all over this country. They are sick and tired of being ripped off by corporations making record-breaking profits while working families are forced to pay outrageously high prices for gas, rent, food, and prescription drugs,' said Sanders. Sanders may well be right, but if 'sick and tired' Americans vote against the Biden administration in November, his chances of pushing for change will fall.", "264114775f4e46b90a96bc1027199e1c479edd69473382cf85e14fc1": "Brexit has pushed up the price of food imported from the EU, compounding Britain's unfolding cost of living crisis, according to a report. The thinktank UK in a Changing Europe (UKICE) said trade barriers introduced after leaving the EU had led to a 6% increase in UK food prices between December 2019 and September 2021, adding to the rising financial pressure for households. The report found products with a higher EU import share, such as fresh pork, tomatoes and jams, were worse-affected than items where UK imports were more commonly sourced from the rest of the world, such as tuna and exotic fruits like pineapple. Households across the UK are on track to suffer the worst living standards squeeze since the 1950s amid soaring inflation driven by the rising price of energy, food and fuel. Annual inflation reached 7% in March, the highest rate since 1992. Economists have warned that inflation, which acts as a gauge for the rising cost of living, could hit 10% this year amid rising prices for gas and electricity triggered by the war in Ukraine. The report, produced by researchers from the London School of Economics' Centre for Economic Performance with funding from UKICE, found that a 'clear and robust impact of Brexit-induced trade frictions' had led to the increase in prices. It said Covid-19 could be ruled out as an influencing factor because there was a correlation between price increases and the share of EU imports for a particular product. Analysing trade figures compiled by the UN and price data from the Office for National Statistics, it found the two most notable increases coincided with Boris Johnson's 2019 election victory, when a 'hard Brexit' became more likely, and the implementation of the post-Brexit trade deal in January 2021. Figures from the ONS show that consumer food prices fell over the period analysed by the academics. Prices have risen sharply in recent months as the cost of living spirals upwards. The analysts said this suggested that in absence of Brexit food prices could have further fallen. The UK has repeatedly delayed import checks on goods arriving from the EU as ministers sought to minimise disruption. The prime minister hinted last week that physical Brexit border checks on food imports from the EU due to be introduced in July would be delayed for the fourth time amid fears that supplies could be affected. Other economists say it is difficult to disentangle the effects of Brexit from other factors such as the Covid-19 pandemic, Russia's war in Ukraine, movements in financial markets, global trade bottlenecks and shortages of workers and supplies across advanced economies. Official forecasts suggest fuel and utility bills will account for nearly half of this year's rise in inflation. Although the government has emphasised this point, pro-Brexit ministers had previously said that leaving the EU would bring down food costs by opening up the British market to exporters from around the world. Government sources said that agricultural commodity prices were linked to global gas costs. 'To blame Brexit is simply wrong,' they added. Figures from the accountancy firm UHY Hacker Young show that UK businesses and consumers paid PS4.8bn in customs duties on imported goods last year, a new record, and up from PS2.9bn a year earlier. Sean Glancy, a partner at the accountancy firm, said that some of the rise will have been due to a post-pandemic recovery in trade but that most of it was probably due to leaving the EU. 'Brexit related customs duty increases could not come at a worse time for British businesses and consumers. Inflationary pressures caused by Covid and the war in Ukraine are being exacerbated by those extra import duties,' he said. Jonathan Portes, a senior research fellow at UKICE, said: 'While Brexit is not the main driver of rising inflation or the cost of living crisis, this report provides clear evidence that it has led to a substantial increase in food prices, which will hit the poorest families hardest.' A government spokesperson said: 'Food prices fluctuate in any given year and depend on a range of factors including exchange rates and commodity prices. The sustained increase in global gas prices has led to increased input costs for the dairy and egg industries, including feed and fuel costs.'", "0bccc5b91bdccbc00f5bd1c1627bd3d46624b1d54bb162bfc9c252b2": "Women with asthma are twice as likely to die from an asthma attack compared with men in the UK, new figures show as health experts called for urgent research into the condition's sex-related differences. They are more likely to have the condition, more likely to need hospital treatment for it and more likely to die from an attack, Asthma + Lung UK said. Over the past five years women have accounted for more than two-thirds of asthma deaths in the UK. The charity said the current 'one size fits all' approach to asthma treatment is 'not working' because it does not take into account the impact that female sex hormones during puberty, periods, pregnancy and menopause can have on asthma symptoms and attacks. More must be done to tackle the 'stark health inequality', it added. In childhood, asthma is more prevalent and severe in boys. However, after puberty the situation completely reverses, Asthma + Lung UK said. Between 2014-15 and 2019-20 more than 5,100 women in the UK died from an asthma attack compared with fewer than 2,300 men. Meanwhile, emergency hospital admissions in England show that, among those aged 20 to 49, women were 2.5 times more likely to be admitted to hospital for asthma treatment compared with men. Asthma + Lung UK said many people were unaware that fluctuations in female sex hormones can cause asthma symptoms to flare up or even trigger life-threatening attacks. It is calling for more research to examine the sex-related differences in asthma. Poppy Hadkinson, 30, a TV presenter from Stratford-upon-Avon, said her asthma worsened when she went through puberty. 'I was diagnosed with asthma aged 11, which looking back on it was when I was right in the middle of going through puberty,' she said. 'Over the next decade, I had regular asthma attacks and would end up in hospital up to six times a year. 'There seemed to be a pattern to my symptoms, linked to my menstrual cycle. Nearly every month in the run up to my period, I'd be really ill with my asthma. My symptoms would leave me struggling to breathe, which was terrifying, and I'd often end up in hospital. 'The asthma attacks I suffered were so severe that I'd been ventilated four times by the time I was 22 and was questioning whether I'd make it to my next birthday.' She later began using a biologic drug, omalizumab, which has been a 'life-changer'.  'We need to better understand how asthma affects women so we can find treatments that will give women like me their lives back,' she said. Asthma + Lung UK is encouraging GPs to explore potential triggers with their patients and create tailored adjustments to a patient's medication regimen. Women are also being encouraged to take their preventer medication as prescribed, ensure they attend their annual asthma review, and to keep a symptom diary that could help identify triggers. The Asthma + Lung UK chief executive, Sarah Woolnough, said: 'When it comes to research funding, women with asthma have drawn the short straw. Gaps in our knowledge are failing women, leaving them struggling with debilitating asthma symptoms, stuck in a cycle of being in and out of hospital and, in some cases, losing their lives. 'By understanding the role of sex hormones in asthma, we could transform the lives of the 3 million women with the condition in the UK and the many millions of women with asthma across the world. We urgently need to see more investment in research in this area so we can find new treatments and better use existing treatments to help millions of women and save lives.'", "b48b3e7237074d46c8a5753c0f982f5761a13d5eda8ffed6c1a86b91": "", "95749c51af073ff3bdd6a6f762a64c472e41d8494333c92cc5fe1c8a": "", "896edf4f748ef5d6c7757cbe4fd9a44133629e40fc6c4ba9dbb47d02": "", "ae7731a52fbfcddbcc4dc11954825f3a4819e07e13e98299a5e8a16b": "'Don't take risks - stay with us,' says one of the slogans at the Nueva Castilla motel, a $37.85 (PS30) per night roadside inn in the Mexican city of Monterrey. But the horrifying discovery of a dead teenager in the lodge's water tank has sparked a nationwide outcry and protests in a country facing a spiraling femicide crisis that saw 1,000 women murdered last year because of their gender. Demonstrators gathered outside the motel on Monday night for the latest in a series of rallies demanding justice for Debanhi Susana Escobar Bazaldua, whose disappearance and apparent murder have rekindled devastating memories of a wave of killings in the border city of Ciudad Juarez two decades ago. 'Femicide nation,' read one of dozens of handmade placards left outside at a shrine remembering the 18-year-old law student. 'We are destroyed inside,' the victim's father, Mario Escobar, told journalists on Saturday as his daughter was laid to rest at a hilltop cemetery in northern Mexico. Mystery still surrounds what happened to Escobar, a budding lawyer who vanished after leaving a party in the early hours of Saturday 9 April and whose corpse was only found last Thursday, 13 days later. But her case - the latest in a string of gender-related killings and disappearances of young women this year - has scandalized Mexico. At least 52 women have been reported missing in Nuevo Leon this year, the majority in or around the capital, Monterrey. After Escobar argued with friends, a taxi was reportedly called to take her back to her home in the industrial suburbs of Monterrey. Instead, for reasons unknown, the teenager was left on an empty motorway a few hundred metres from the motel. The driver, who has been accused of making unwanted advances on his passenger, took a haunting final photograph of the student standing alone on the roadside in a long brown skirt and high-top trainers. Video evidence reportedly shows that soon after being dropped off, at about 4.30am, Escobar entered the Nueva Castilla motel. 'Debhani went into the building and they are trying to understand what happened ... and why she ended up inside this cistern,' her father told reporters on Monday. Investigators, who say Escobar died from blunt force trauma to the head, initially suggested the victim might have accidentally fallen to her death - a version her father has emphatically rejected, claiming she was beaten and strangled. 'This was murder. They killed her ... and I will not stop until this is cleared up,' Mario Escobar, who commissioned a second independent autopsy and vowed to seek a third if necessary, told reporters. Public anger has been compounded by the fact that it took nearly a fortnight for Escobar's body to be found, despite police searching the motel on at least four occasions in an operation that included sniffer dogs and drones. Escobar's death has exposed what activists call Mexico's worsening gender violence crisis and the botched and apathetic response from authorities. Last year Mexico recorded 1,015 cases of femicide - when a woman is murdered specifically because of her gender - compared with 977 in 2020. Overall, about 3,500 women were killed. 'What happened to Debhani happens in thousands of other cases across the country on a daily basis,' said Edith Olivares Ferreto, the executive director of Amnesty International in Mexico. 'Eleven women are killed in this country every day. We have at least 20,000 women who are missing in Mexico. And the state's failures in searching for these women and investigating what has happened to them have remained unchanged for almost 30 years now,' she added. Activist Frida Guerrera, who tries to track down the perpetrators of such crimes, denounced what she described as a never-ending nightmare: 'It is every single day.' Guerrera blamed rampant impunity for the emergency in a country where more than 90% of all crimes go unsolved. 'When a woman is killed and nothing happens, it kills her whole family, her whole society. Police will find the body sometimes, and then the investigation just stops, so the predators are never brought to justice, and by the next day, they've taken another girl. People don't understand until it's their own daughter,' she said, urging Mexicans to take the crisis more seriously. 'Society will forget again like it has forgotten before. But society should in reality be very worried.' Many women's rights advocates hoped for progress after the supposedly progressive Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador was elected president in 2018. Yet Lopez Obrador, a 68-year-old nationalist known as Amlo, has repeatedly clashed with the feminist movement, at times suggesting such campaigners were the tools of his conservative political rivals. In early 2020, after a series of murders provoked demonstrations that some called Mexico's feminist spring, masked protesters surrounded the presidential palace in Mexico City and daubed its walls with the words: 'Amlo is killing us'. Last week, after Escobar's body was found, Amlo drew further criticism for claiming citizens had no reason to worry. 'This happens everywhere,' he said. Olivares Ferreto voiced frustration at what she called Amlo's repeated attempts to downplay the scale of the violence and government hostility towards 'the legitimate struggle of Mexican women' to be safe. 'This is one of the governments that has been most vocal about attacking the feminist movement in recent decades,' she said. 'All we want is for the state to do its job. We are not talking about reinventing the wheel.' Olivares Ferreto remembered how nearly two decades ago her human rights group had released a report called Intolerable Killings about an internationally notorious wave of femicides in Ciudad Juarez - and the bungled official response. 'Tragically, what was happening in Ciudad Juarez in the 1990s, is now happening across the entire country,' she said. 'This country has become one big Ciudad Juarez.'", "4aa6ee676cca55017083b1b930393b9b95cf564887ba60294082028c": "", "497f69d8f693bb6076c9be0138c6bc0d6d12cea5e1ae0013a63b11f8": "", "b249c909a6b51cf1c1cf898479fab781c8f1b55cb9be29d1e382dfba": "", "93ab985798724ba2af9072ea9c9fa29265458a7e2e389452ad27bfaa": "", "45bd3c5a58b5621ad4fa41c483fba36a4bc02c56b9e90fc0e93970be": "", "faaedcc5c46d4db7122960c627739289248efbbcc48d8bbee4118cd4": "", "9caeef37fc0bf40e7a03c576952e52a7bbd8d3123ac06d6b0f598581": "", "a9c3b3fc916a4719a162a78520f3bceda01c27d3cc3c39b2daa443c0": "", "1183da2289980348ca2706f213026e3305145ef49b66a60e75349ac0": "", "820cd0a033280ccab6ae796a1fe97eae63bb4d9eed5b07ca8c360da9": "", "e5be4c7afbdc9ee4995d2c1ebd487a18faf13f610038b21c6f40c601": "", "74bbf6f64540dfa6ff95ea6438f1efa1532e2bb08354ba2791b7ac95": "Survivors of South Africa's devastating floods have described 'sheet upon sheet of relentless rain' that washed away entire houses, bridges and roads, killing about 450 people and making thousands homeless. The storm, which delivered close to an entire year's usual rainfall in 48 hours, took meteorologists by surprise and has been blamed by experts on climate change. The new disaster comes after three tropical cyclones and two tropical storms hit south-east Africa in just six weeks in the first months of this year. The full extent of the devastation caused by the floods in South Africa this month is yet to become clear, with many victims still missing and authorities still learning of new damage around the eastern coastal city of Durban. Many tens of thousands of people remain without water, and there are rising concerns about an outbreak of infectious disease. Uzair Ismail, 35, said he had been forced to flee his home in central Durban with his wife and eight-year-old when water and mud flooded in through doors, windows and plumbing in the middle of the night when the storm struck almost two weeks ago. 'We were lucky to get out alive ... Slowly, slowly we had built ourselves up to a livable home with a few possessions and we had left everything. But others lost much more. We are safe at least,' Ismail told the Guardian. Some families were almost entirely wiped out in the disaster, losing eight or 10 members. The South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, described a 'catastrophe of enormous proportions' and attributed the disaster to the climate emergency. 'It is telling us that climate change is serious, it is here,' Ramaphosa said as he visited the flooded metropolitan area of eThekwini, which includes Durban, shortly after the floods. 'We no longer can postpone what we need to do, and the measures we need to take to deal with climate change.' Others have echoed Ramaphosa's warning. 'This is just the beginning of a series of extreme weather events that are linked to climate change ... Africa pollutes least and suffers most from climate change,' said Ibrahima Cheikh Diong, the director general of African Risk Capacity, an agency set up by the African Union to help governments better plan for disasters and mitigate their impact. Poor people living in makeshift settlements built on unstable, steep-sided gorges around Durban were worst affected by the floods. Most have inadequate or no drainage systems and homes are sometimes flimsy shacks that offer little protection against the elements. Fernaaz Hussain, a 35-year-old coordinator for aid agency Islamic Relief, who lives in Durban, said she had first thought the rain was just part of the city's tropical weather, but became worried when it did not stop. 'It was just relentless. There was just sheet after sheet and you couldn't see anything beyond. It just did not stop. It just got worse and worse. I have never seen anything like it in my life. The rain was so heavy and the wind so strong we feared the windows [would] break,' Hussain said. She described shipping containers floating down motorways and an oil tanker washed up on Durban's famous beach. 'You can't do anything to help yourself. You feel just totally powerless. And tomorrow it could happen again and there's nothing we could do,' she said. Experts say the impact of the climate crisis is increasingly obvious across Africa, with tens of millions suffering from drought in the Sahel and parts of east Africa, while the continent's southeastern coast is hit by intense storms. The World Weather Attribution (WWA) network of scientists, which has pioneered ways to understand the causes of extreme weather events, said climate change had made the heavy rains along Africa's south eastern coastline both heavier and more likely. 'Again we are seeing how the people with the least responsibility for climate change are bearing the brunt of the impacts,' said WWA co-founder Friederike Otto, of the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London. After Tropical Storm Ana smashed into the region in January, Tropical Cyclone Batsirai hit Madagascar in early February, followed in quick succession by Tropical Storm Dumako and Tropical Cyclones Emnati and Gombe. WWA scientists used weather observations and computer simulations to compare rainfall patterns under today's climate to that of the pre-industrial area, before global heating. They focused on two of the wettest periods - during Storm Ana in Malawi and Mozambique and during Cyclone Batsirai in Madagascar. 'In both cases, the results show that rainfall associated with the storms was made more intense by climate change and that episodes of extreme rainfall such as these have become more frequent,' WWA said in a report of their findings. Their conclusions matched broader climate research showing that global heating can increase the frequency and intensity of rainfall, though determining exactly how much climate change influences the extreme events is made difficult by a shortage of high quality historical rainfall records for the region. The South African Weather Service said that although it was impossible to attribute an individual event to the climate crisis, 'globally, all forms of severe and extreme weather ... are becoming more frequent and more extreme than in the recent past (as a direct result of global warming and associated climate change). In other words, heavy rain events such as the current incident can ... be expected to recur in the future and with increasing frequency.' Many countries in Africa are poorly prepared for such disasters. Though the most industrialised country on the continent, South Africa has struggled to deliver timely and efficient help to flood victims. One reason for the shortage of water among those displaced by the floods in and around Durban there is that around half of the local government's fleet of 100 water tankers were found to be inoperable when officials ordered their deployment last week. Thousands of troops have now been deployed to assist the aid operation. Analysts say extreme weather events can contribute to political instability across the continent. In South Africa, repeated failure to offer timely and effective relief to victims has exacerbated a general lack of faith in the African National Congress, in power since 1994. 'It's just been normal people helping each other. I've had more support from strangers. I won't even ask the government. The funds always go missing and never reach the right people,' said Ismail. Police have been forced to use teargas to disperse protesters angry at a lack of assistance from authorities. 'It is only because ANC officials regularly fail to care in desperate moments such as these that so many people are convinced that the party is hopelessly corrupt and that even the flood relief funds will be stolen,' wrote commentator Stephen Grootes in an editorial on the Daily Maverick news website. Sean Christie of Medecins Sans Frontieres said the NGO was working with local health authorities to supply nurses and counsellors to flood victims. 'On psychosocial mental health, we have seen lots and lots of need,' he told the Guardian.", "0ad2a3ad57e138535b16d4eaebdf9433a9049098a860c4b9e4d1f84d": "Leading former diplomats including seven ex-UK foreign and defence ministers have warned the Iran nuclear talks are heading to 'corrosive stalemate devolving into a cycle of increased nuclear tension' and urged Tehran and Washington to show more flexibility. Year-long talks in Vienna on reviving the deal and for the US, which was pulled out of the agreement by Donald Trump, to lift sanctions on Iran have in effect ground to a halt in a dispute over whether the west will lift the foreign terrorist organisation designation, and sanctions, against the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). The former diplomats said in an open letter that a final draft text of a renewed agreement was ready to be signed and warned that 'for US and European leaders to let slip the opportunity to defuse a nuclear crisis in the Middle East would be a grave mistake'. Washington says the sanctions on the IRGC do not relate to the nuclear deal, but to its long-term terrorist behaviour in the region, including in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. The signatories to the open letter, coordinated the European Leadership Network, include former senior diplomats in 14 countries including the former foreign secretary Jack Straw, former defence secretaries Lord King and Des Browne, as well as the former Conservative Middle East minister Alistair Burt. They say the legacy of Trump's strategic error in leaving the agreement 'can today be measured in the tons of enriched uranium Iran has since accumulated, including uranium enriched to near-weapons grade; in the thousands of advanced centrifuges it is spinning; and, in the rapidly dwindling timeframe for Iran to reach a breakout capability'. The US left the nuclear deal in 2018. Joe Biden on his election as president said he wanted to rejoin so long as Iran came back into compliance with the agreement on nuclear non-proliferation. One proposal that Israel fears the US administration will adopt is to retain sanctions on the elite foreign arm of the IRGC, the al-Quds force, but lift the designation on the IRGC domestically. The letter's authors acknowledge the politics of the foreign terrorist organisation designation are difficult but insist 'there are ways to provide the counter-terrorism benefits of the current designation while still accommodating Iran's specific request, and consider it imperative that these be fully explored'. 'For its part, Iran should not expect a nuclear deal to address broader areas of disagreement between Tehran and Washington. Both sides must approach this final phase of negotiation with an understanding that the strategic implications of failure would be grave and profound.'", "ad11628e68284d056a9a3a45f08b4fbb6b30091679f1338237d34cb6": "Workers upgrading water supplies in southern Spain have come across an 'unprecedented' and well-preserved necropolis of subterranean limestone vaults where the Phoenicians who lived on the Iberian peninsula 2,500 years ago laid their dead. Archaeologists exploring the site - which was discovered amid the Roman ruins in the town of Osuna, 55 miles (90km) east of Seville - say the Phoenician-Carthaginian cemetery dates back to the fourth or fifth century BC and is highly unusual as such sites are normally found in coastal areas rather than so far inland. Although the local ruins of the Roman city of Urso are well known, the discovery of the Phoenician necropolis has stunned archaeologists and locals. The only similar finds have been made around the coast of Cadiz, which was founded by the Phoenicians in 1100BC and which is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Europe. Preliminary surveys have so far turned up eight burial vaults as well as staircases and areas that are thought to have served as atriums. The culture and historical heritage department of the Andalucian regional government, which is overseeing the excavations, said its archaeologists had discovered 'a series of remains of unquestionable historical value' that were 'unprecedented in inland Andalucia'. The lead archaeologist, Mario Delgado, described the discovery as very significant and very unexpected. 'To find a necropolis from the Phoenician and Carthaginian era with these characteristics - with eight well tombs, atriums and staircase access - you'd have to look to Sardinia or even Carthage itself,' he said. 'We thought we might find remains from the imperial Roman age, which would be more in keeping with the surroundings, so we were surprised when we found these structures carved from the rock - hypogea [subterranean vaults] - perfectly preserved beneath the Roman levels.' Rosario Andujar, the mayor of Osuna, said the find had already prompted a re-examination of the area's history. 'We all know that excavations in certain parts of our town are pretty likely to turn up remains that have varying degrees of historical value, but we've never gone this deep before,' said Andujar, who visited the site on Monday. The new evidence of a Phoenician-Carthaginian presence in the area, added Andujar, 'doesn't change history - but it does change what we'd known until now about the history of Osuna, and it could be a turning point'. The mayor said that while more research needed to be done, the luxurious nature of the necropolis suggested it had been built for those at 'the highest level' of the social hierarchy. 'The operation isn't over yet and there's still more to be discovered,' she said. 'But the team has already come up with reliable information that attests to the historical importance of all this. Both the graves themselves and the ritual spaces that are being examined suggest that this wasn't any old burial site.' Osuna, which has a population of nearly 18,000, found a worldwide audience eight years ago when parts of the fifth season of Game of Thrones were filmed in the town.", "afc6ae2ce05c4e7486df058518820fb0ba2510351ccf54e3dda0dcac": "The renowned DJ Tim Westwood has been accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women who claim he misused his position in the music industry to take advantage of them. Three women have accused the DJ of opportunistic and predatory sexual behaviour, while four others allege they were groped by him at events. The women, who were in their late teens or early 20s when they say the incidents happened, described their experiences to the Guardian and BBC News as part of a joint investigation into the former BBC Radio 1 DJ. The earliest alleged incident took place in 1992; the most recent in 2017. One of the women said: 'Someone taking advantage of my naivety and lack of confidence isn't something that I should have to carry with shame.' Westwood has strenuously denied all the allegations. A spokesperson said they were completely false and denied in their entirety. In response to the allegations on Tuesday the BBC said it was 'shocked'. A spokesperson said: 'The BBC is against all forms of inappropriate behaviour and we are shocked to hear of these allegations. The BBC has strict codes of conduct for all those engaged by the BBC, including on-air presenters.' The women, who are all black, decided to tell their stories in the aftermath of anonymous allegations of inappropriate behaviour about Westwood circulating on social media in June 2020. In a statement at the time, Westwood denied any wrongdoing, saying the allegations online were fabricated, false and without foundation. The Guardian and BBC, which has released a documentary on BBC Three about the story, have since spoken to seven women who make a range of separate allegations about the DJ's conduct. Some of the women say they felt unable to talk about their experiences before. They feared their accounts would not be taken seriously because they were so young at the time the alleged incidents happened - and that racial discrimination would also lead people to minimise, dismiss or ignore their claims. Three of the women have accused Westwood of opportunistic and predatory sexual behaviour when they agreed to meet him, thinking they would be discussing the music industry or their own work. They were 17, 19 and 20 at the time of the alleged incidents. A further four women claim the DJ groped them while they were having a picture taken with him after one of his nightclub performances. The Guardian and BBC know the identities of all the women, who are not known to each other and have never spoken. None of the women had reported their interactions to the police; all have asked to remain anonymous. Now 64, Westwood has been one of the best-known names in hip-hop and rap in the UK for the past 40 years. He became the genre's unmistakable voice when he started hosting BBC Radio 1's first Rap Show in 1994, credited with giving fresh talent an unparalleled platform while enticing the biggest rappers in the world - from Public Enemy to Jay-Z - onto his show. Westwood has always courted a degree of controversy, often playing to a bad-boy image with on-mic banter that can be provocative and sexually explicit. In 1999, he was injured in a drive-by shooting, with one bullet going through the seat of the car he was in and another through his arm. He became a key figure in black music in the UK and was named best DJ at the Mobo (Music of Black Origin) awards multiple times. After 20 years, the self-styled Big Dawg, left Radio 1, as part of a shake-up of its Saturday night schedule, and now hosts a show on Capital Xtra as well as regular club nights. A source at the BBC said the allegations were 'appalling and disturbing' and said the corporation was not 'sitting on' any information that would aid an investigation into the former Radio 1 DJ. Lawyers acting for Westwood said he was a well-respected and highly successful DJ. They said he strenuously denied in their entirety the serious allegations being made against him. 'Any suggestion that he acts, or has acted, in the way described would be false and seriously defamatory.' They said he wanted to make clear that he did not behave in the manner described. The Guardian has approached Global, the parent company of Capital Xtra, where Westwood is currently employed, for comment. Isabel* was 19 when she says she was the victim of Westwood's alleged predatory behaviour in 2010. He was 53 at the time. The university graduate described wanting to pursue a career in music - she grew up in the Midlands, singing gospel and writing her own songs. When she discovered Westwood was DJing at a nightclub in her home town in 2010, she says she hoped to get her music into his hands. 'At that moment, he was the main gatekeeper for access to what I needed to do,' she says. She described to the Guardian and BBC putting together a demo CD, with her contact details inside, and says she went to the nightclub, supported by her best friend and stepmother. Isabel says they managed to give the CD to the DJ, who, to her excitement, called her the next day and suggested meeting in London. 'We were thinking that this is a really good lead at this point,' she says. 'He wants to act on this quickly.' She says a few days later she took the train to London for an afternoon meeting and met Westwood at Oxford Circus, where he picked her up in his car. Isabel says her 'complete assumption' was that they were going somewhere to talk about her music. 'The phone call was the only interaction we'd had before that,' she says. 'There was nothing flirtatious or romantic about the nature of the conversation.' But she says that when the journey lasted longer than she expected and her surroundings became unfamiliar, she started to become anxious. 'We got in the car. He made the most minimal amount of small talk. I could tell that he wasn't particularly interested in the music thing,' she says. Isabel says she was looking away from him but then turned to find Westwood had undone his trousers and was exposing himself. 'I didn't actually see him undo his trousers. What alerted me to the fact that he was exposing himself was the fact that he actually tapped me to turn around to look. I've looked and I've seen and I'm like, 'Oh, no, oh no, like, oh my God',' she says. Isabel says she felt scared but unable to get herself out of the situation. She says they arrived at a flat, which she believes was his, where he offered her a drink - which she refused. It was in this flat, which Isabel says was strewn with records, that she claims she was the victim of a second episode of opportunistic and predatory sexual behaviour. She claims that when Westwood came back from getting himself a drink in another room, he was naked. 'That's when I noticed that he's got a condom and he's removed it [from the packet] and started putting it on,' she says, adding that she recognised the condom from a campaign Westwood had done with the brand Durex - which he promoted at events. 'I remember the packet because they had this slogan on it. They had his face on the other side,' she says. 'I remember him throwing it down. I remember the fact that it was yellow. Like, I remember that very vividly because I remember that was kind of when my brain also started to shut down.' She says Westwood initiated sex, and although she did not vocalise her misgivings, she was 'frozen'. 'I didn't have any sort of guard up for that situation,' she says. 'It's all very reactive ... because it's just happening. And the shock factor of it is so overwhelming that it kind of disorientates the rest of the way you think. It's like you're stunned.' Isabel says Westwood then left the room. When he returned she had her bag on her lap to indicate she wanted to leave, and he took her to a train station. She says that as he dropped her off he tried to give her one of his mix CDs but she refused. Isabel says she felt 'stupid' on the train journey home. 'I just remember feeling so deflated. So sad. Feeling really ashamed of myself and bad.' She says she remembers getting a text message from her friend who had been waiting to hear how the meeting had gone. 'I didn't say what happened but I sent a text to let her know like we didn't listen, it didn't happen. We didn't listen to my music ... it's not gone down like that.' Isabel's stepmother told the BBC and Guardian the whole family had been excited about Isabel meeting the DJ, hoping for a breakthrough in her career. But she knew instinctively that something 'was wrong' when her stepdaughter would not talk about the meeting. But she says after she heard Isabel's story, she felt guilty for not chaperoning her - and says she cried when Isabel disclosed that her silence was partly due to fears that her family would be disappointed in her. Like others the Guardian and BBC spoke to, Isabel says she became aware in 2020 of allegations being made by women on social media alleging misconduct by Westwood. Isabel says she is telling her story now because she felt what had happened to her was an abuse of the DJ's position. 'It is a privilege to be able to do what you love as a job and it's a privilege to be given a platform to do it on,' she says. 'So it's a massive violation when you abuse that.' Westwood has strenuously denied acting in the manner described by Isabel. Pamela's* story shares similarities with Isabel's. Now in her 40s, Pamela was 20 when she says she first met the DJ through friends. It was 2000 and she was active in the youth rap scene, working with aspiring young musicians. The DJ - then in his 40s - wanted to connect with a younger audience and asked her to do work experience with him, she says. She says he reassured her mother on the phone, and Pamela travelled to London to meet him for work experience. But when Westwood picked her up from King's Cross train station in a large American-style car he soon began touching her leg and face while he was driving, she alleges. She says while she was batting his hand away he was not concentrating on the road and was driving erratically. A police officer on a motorbike pulled up alongside the car and knocked on the passenger window. Pamela says she sat in silence as Westwood apologised and was told to keep his eyes on the road. Pamela says she had expected to stay on her own in a hotel, although this had not been discussed, and instead she says he drove her to what she understood to be his flat. 'If you're going to do an internship somewhere, you're not expecting for that person to take you to their house. That's unprofessional,' she says. After some hours, the DJ sat next to her and tried to kiss her neck and remove items of her clothing, she says, adding that she moved away, trying to replace them. 'I didn't give him any kind of come-on. There was no flirtation,' she says. She says when Westwood initiated sex, she remembers thinking she could not get out of the situation. 'I'm in London alone with this man. Now if I try to get out of this, who's to say how he's going to react. So I just submit to it.' She says she has not spoken about the encounter in its entirety, until now. 'People like me don't ever get believed when we speak about stuff like this, so we don't,' she says, adding that she found the encounter 'traumatic'. 'It was disgusting and I felt like shit afterwards, really disgusting,' she says. She says the work experience he offered never happened, and she went home as soon as she could. Pamela later spoke to a friend who works in the music industry and they encouraged her to talk about her experience in this investigation. Tamara* says she first met Westwood when she was a 17-year-old member of a British R&B group and he was in his mid-30s and the 'No 1 hip-hop DJ at the time'. She says when he asked if she wanted to 'hang out', she thought it was to talk about her career. 'He could make or break your career,' she says. 'If you wanted to get any kind of exposure, you would try to get your demo to him and pray that he would play it. He had absolute power. 'Within the recording industry and the black community, despite him being a white man, he had absolute power.' But Tamara says that once they were in a flat she believes was his, without saying anything he pulled down her trousers and underwear. She claims he then began performing oral sex on her. 'There was no talking. There was no kind of communication about that. It was just before I knew it, that's what was happening,' she says. Tamara says she was taken aback and at first tried to push his head and shoulders away. 'And then I realised that, you know what? I'm in a position where it's already gone too far,' she says. 'I'm already far from home. I wouldn't even know how to leave this particular place. I wouldn't know how to get home from here ... Then he finishes and it's as if that hadn't happened.' The woman says they then had casual sex two or three times over a period of three years. Looking back at those encounters, Tamara says she was so young she lacked 'the strength and courage' to say: ''No ... I don't feel right about this', because I didn't feel right about it.' Now with a daughter in her 20s, Tamara says she has decided to share her experience for the first time after her daughter showed her the online allegations about Westwood that surfaced in 2020, adding that she was concerned his ongoing regular club nights meant he was often in contact with young women. In 2021, Tamara watched the BBC documentary Music's Dirty Secrets and contacted the producers asking them to investigate the DJ. The Guardian and BBC also spoke to four other women who claim they were groped by Westwood when they posed for a picture with him, after he had performed DJ sets. The Guardian and BBC have seen the Snapchat footage and the images the women say were taken during the encounters. The earliest dates to 2000, when Farah* was 19 and working with a promotional street team during Bristol carnival. Afterwards she says she met Westwood, then in his mid-40s, at an afterparty and recalls him asking about her work. She says when the event had finished, the street team gathered to take a photograph with the DJ, but as it was being taken he put his hand inside her T-shirt and grabbed her breast. 'Just the thought of somebody doing that - I felt cold. And I felt dirty. I felt humiliated, embarrassed. That I'd done something wrong,' she says. Two women allege they were groped in 2009, when the DJ was in his early 50s. In the summer, Claire*, then 20, went to a nightclub in Ayia Napa - the DJ had been playing and she says she queued to take a photograph with him after his set. But as her friend was taking the picture, she claims Westwood said 'lemme grab some ass' and put his hand down the back of her denim shorts. 'As I was shocked, I froze and felt very intimidated,' she says. 'He then started asking if I was interested in going back to where he was staying to 'chill', as I was stood, still mentally trying to process what just happened.' She says she turned down the offer. Later in the year, before Christmas, Loretta* says she also posed for a photograph with the DJ after he had performed at a nightclub in Essex. The then 19-year-old says she felt the DJ's hand go down her back and grab her bottom, before resting on her neck. 'In that moment, I was kind of frozen and I didn't really know how to react,' she says. 'I mean, I know how I would react now as a grown woman, but as a teenager, I really didn't.' Nyla* says she met Westwood nine years later, in 2017, when she was 22 and he was 59 and DJing at a New Year's Day event in London. She says he got his security to ask her on stage, and when she did he used the microphone to declare her 'the pengest girl in the rave'. At the end of the night she says her friend wanted a video of the DJ. While the pair posed, Nyla says Westwood moved his hand down her back and up the back of her skirt. 'I couldn't really do anything to stop it or prevent it. So it felt like that had been taken out of my hands,' she says. Nyla says Westwood called her the next day on Snapchat - she thinks after getting her number from a guest list - 'asking if I want to hang out and stuff' and telling her she did not have to come alone and could bring friends. She says before long she ended the conversation and blocked his number. 'Sometimes I just feel like his persona or his kind of stage character, people take that really lightly and see it as something that's sort of satirical when actually it's not really funny,' she says. 'I didn't have a chance to voice my own opinion in that moment. I didn't really feel like a human. I just felt objectified.' *Names have been changed. alexandra.topping@theguardian.com", "f273f7b7bccd03b67f28c567fdc760455715ef5cc2772f6b9ddcca2d": "Natural gas prices continue to climb on wholesale markets, as Russia made good on its longstanding threat to cut gas supplies to countries that don't pay in roubles - starting with Poland and Bulgaria. Poland and Bulgaria say this amounts to breach of contract, as the contracts stipulate payments in euros. The British wholesale gas contract for immediate delivery has climbed nearly 14% to 146.50 pence per therm.

The CBI's headline retail sales balance plunged to -35 in April from 9 in March. The balance deducts the number of retailers saying sales increased from those reporting a fall. CBI economist Martin Sartorius said: Natural gas prices have risen on the news. The British wholesale gas contract for next winter has climbed 15.7% to 260.51 pence per therm. The equivalent Dutch benchmark has risen 8.3% to EUR104 per megawatt hour. The Polish state-owned oil and gas company PGNiG confirmed its supplies from Gazprom have been cut, but said it was still supplying its own clients. Both countries are hugely reliant on Russian gas, as supplies from Gazprom cover half of Poland's consumption and 90% of Bulgaria's. Bulgaria is in talks aimed at importing liquefied natural gas through Turkey and Greece. Germany, the biggest taker of Russian energy, said this week it hopes to stop importing Russian oil within days. But weaning itself off Russian gas is a different matter. The Russian energy firm Gazprom said it has halted gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria after both countries refused to pay in roubles, rather than euros, as the row between Moscow and the west over Russia's invasion of Ukraine escalated. Poland has confirmed that supplies have been cut, while Bulgaria said it would find out soon. Both accused Gazprom of breaching longstanding supply contracts.

The findings from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) come after researchers examined blood samples from more than 200,000 Americans and looked for virus-fighting antibodies made from infections, not vaccines. They found that signs of past infection rose dramatically between December and February, when the more contagious Omicron variant surged through the US. For Americans of all ages, about 34% had signs of prior infection in December. Just two months later, 58% did. 'I did expect it to increase. I did not expect it to increase quite this much,' said Dr Kristie Clarke, co-leader of a CDC team that tracks the extent of coronavirus infections. In the CDC report, the most striking increase was in children. The percentage of those 17 and under with antibodies rose from about 45% in December to about 75% in February. The older people were, the less likely they had evidence of past infections. That may be because older adults have higher vaccination rates and they may be more likely to take other Covid-19 precautions, such as wearing masks and avoiding crowds, Clarke said. Reported cases had a huge surge in December and January, then fell almost as dramatically as they had risen. But daily case counts have been trending up again in recent weeks. The case numbers are believed to be an undercount, but officials do think recent increases reflect a true rise in infections. Many Covid-19 infections are mild enough that patients do not seek care or confirmatory lab tests. CDC officials say they plan to release a study soon that estimates that in recent months there were three infections for every reported case. Another recent trend: US health officials say they have seen two weeks of increases in Covid-19 hospitalizations, though the numbers remain relatively low. Hospital admissions number about 1,600 per day, a 9% increase in the prior week, the CDC reported. Available evidence nevertheless offers reason to be hopeful about how the pandemic is going, officials suggested. 'We are not anticipating more severe disease from some of these subvariants, but we are actively studying them,' said Dr Rochelle Walensky, CDC director, on Tuesday. The study looked for any detectable level of antibodies; it did not distinguish how many people had antibody levels that might be protective. Scientists are still trying to understand what role these kinds of antibodies play in protection from future virus exposures. Officials continue to urge Americans to get vaccines and boosters, which offer additional protection against Covid-19 for all, including those who were previously infected.

Metropolitan water district of southern California's resolution will limit outdoor watering to just one day per week for district residents supplied by a stressed system of canals, pipelines, reservoirs and hydroelectric power plants called the State Water Project, which supplies water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta to 27 million Californians and 750,000 acres of farmland. The restrictions, which take effect in June, will severely limit how much water people can use to water their lawns or wash cars. 'Due to the depth and duration of the current drought, Metropolitan cannot meet normal demands in the SWP dependent area with existing resources,' officials said in a document outlining the action, which targets 'non-essential uses' that tax the declining water supply. Metropolitan, a water wholesaler, left many of the enforcement details up to member agencies, which act on more of a local level. Cities and water suppliers can opt out of the one-day rule, but must find appropriate solutions to curb water consumption and meet monthly reduced goals. If not, they could face steep fines from the water district. The move follows a reduction in deliveries from the State Water Project, as California braces for its third devastatingly dry year. With conditions only expected to worsen in the coming hot, dry, summer months, the state is expecting the water supply to be strained further. Following the driest start of the year on record for precipitation, state officials announced last month that they were cutting allocations from 15% to 5%. Meanwhile, the state's snowpack - now at just 35% of normal for this time of year - is quickly disappearing. More than 95% of the state is experiencing severe drought according to the US drought monitor.  Warming temperatures have exacerbated the conditions, spurring drying and 'shifting the historical relationships between temperature, precipitation, and runoff', officials said. 'We are seeing conditions unlike anything we have seen before,' Adel Hagekhalil, the district's general manager, told the Los Angeles Times. 'We need serious demand reductions.' For the first time ever, the water district also asked for more water from the state, relying on a 'never-before-invoked-provision' that provides for more than the 5% delivery if needed to supply essential health and human safety needs. The water district also requested additional volumes to prevent or suppress wildfires, and said it will work with member agencies and fire authorities on those deliveries as needed. But first, restrictions must be in place. The amount of water also must be returned to the system within five years, 'thus creating a water supply debt that effectively trims future [allocations] and slows any storage recovery once the drought eases', officials said. The water district included some exceptions to their limits on outdoor watering, including what's needed to ensure trees and other perennials don't perish before the restrictions are rescinded. Drip irrigation and other high-efficiency systems are also allowed as long as they don't exceed what would be allotted during a one-day watering from a more wasteful source. These restrictions may increase if the supply wanes further. 'Because of uncertainty in the drought's persistence and the speed and scale of demand response', officials said, authorizations are in place to prohibit 'all non-essential outdoor irrigation as early as September 1'. The emergency water conservation program will also extend through June of next year unless conditions change enough for the board of directors to lift them.", "c733c18d130cc0f3f22e3c5ca245ee722be94e537eb7497d090f8c6f": "", "e630319faceeace9102de1aaacd5035bbbd36e8902bb592e0cb22e29": "A 72-year-old Italian woman has embarked on an epic journey between Venice and Beijing by foot, following the path of the legendary merchant Marco Polo along the ancient Silk Road trade route. Vienna Cammarota left Venice, birthplace of Polo, on Tuesday, and will cover about 13,670 miles (22,000km) as she walks through 15 countries, with the aim of arriving in Beijing in December 2025. Cammarota has been an avid walker for more than 30 years and previously ventured across Tibet, Palestine, Israel, Patagonia and Madagascar on foot. Her most recent adventure took her on a journey through medieval towns in the southern Italian regions of Campania, Calabria and Basilicata. Speaking before setting off, Cammarota said she was ready for her latest challenge, during which she will experience vastly contrasting terrain and climate on the route across countries in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. However, she is also a little nervous. 'It's always the same feeling at the beginning of a trip,' she said. Aside from her backpack, Cammarota is equipped with a GoPro camera to record footage of her travels and a phone that includes an app through which her doctor can check on her health remotely. 'There will be really challenging moments, such as facing the cold in Mongolia, but I'm ready,' she said. Cammarota will cross into Slovenia from northern Italy, before heading to Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Turkey, Georgia, Iran, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and, finally, China. By the time she reaches Beijing she will be 75. She hopes to be hosted by people she meets along the way. 'Not because I'm trying to save money, but because I want to have direct contact and be able to tell the story of the countries through the people hosting me,' she said, adding that her family may join her if she stays in a place for longer than a day or two. Cammarota, who is an ambassador of Archeoclub Italia, an association for the preservation of cultural heritage, has been inspired to explore by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the German author who published diaries of his travels in Italy between 1786 and 1788 in his book, Italian Journey, and of course, by Marco Polo. Polo set off from Venice in 1271 at the age of 17 and spent more than two decades travelling through Asia on a route that later became known as the Silk Road. Probably the most famous European to travel the route, he wrote a book about his adventures that went on to become one of the world's first bestsellers. 'After Von Goethe, I became fascinated by Marco Polo,' said Cammarota. 'I love history, culture and archaeology, and I walk in order to see and recount, but above all to listen.' Cammarota will be travelling with Italian and Ukrainian flags, describing the trip as 'a walk for peace' as she endeavours to 'unite populations'. 'In all likelihood, the journey will cover a distance of about 22,000km, but I don't exclude deviations to take into account the changes that may have occurred along the Silk Road.'", "46c28e8f3be6f8f5e93f8833665d068f7bc0ae15d698c45ac81d4617": "Yuga Labs, the multibillion-dollar collective behind the infamous Bored Ape Yacht Club non-fungible tokens, has been targeted by another hacking attack, leading to the theft of millions of dollars worth of the simian NFTs. BAYC's series of algorithmically generated cartoon ape profile pictures is one of the best-known collections of NFTs - a digital asset or artwork whose ownership is stored on a blockchain, a decentralised ledger of transactions like those used by cryptocurrencies. The attacker seized control of the BAYC Instagram account and sent a phishing post that many followers were fooled into clicking on, connecting their crypto wallets to the hacker's 'smart contract' - a mechanism for implementing a crypto transaction. That enabled the attacker to steal the assets held in the wallets, seizing control of four Bored Apes, as well as a host of other NFTs with an estimated total value of $3m. 'Instagram attacks are nothing new but often take an element of social engineering,' said Jake Moore, global cybersecurity adviser at the security firm ESET. 'Unfortunately, however, this takeover has had a huge consequence and resulted in a mass robbery of digital assets. Similar to when physical art is stolen, there will be questions over how they would now be able to sell on these assets, but the problems in NFTs still prevail and users must remain extremely cautious of this still very new technology.' As one of the most prominent NFT collections, with celebrity owners including Eminem, Gwyneth Paltrow and Madonna, BAYC holders are often targeted for attacks, with greater or lesser technical significance. In early April, for instance, one pseudonymous owner, 's27', lost a $500,000 ape collection after being tricked into swapping it for, effectively, counterfeits: the scammer created new NFTs that were visually identical to BAYC pictures except they had a green tick over them - mimicking the 'verified' icon of the platform used for the trade. In December, another Ape holder, the New York art dealer Todd Kramer, disclosed his own $2.2m loss with the tweet, 'I been hacked. All my apes gone. This just sold please help me.' Kramer, who had fallen prey to a similar phishing scam, managed to recover a portion of his stolen Apes with the help of the NFT trading platform OpenSea - but not before the phrase 'all my apes gone' was widely mocked online among those who doubt the substance of the NFT fad. The BAYC creators said in a statement: 'Yuga Labs and Instagram are currently investigating how the hacker was able to gain access to the account. Two-factor authentication was enabled and the security practices surrounding the IG account were tight.' Hacking and theft are rife in the crypto sector. Transactions are irreversible once made, and it can take a high degree of skill to read the contents of a smart contract and determine whether it is malicious or valid before giving it access to an account. Last week, a 'stablecoin' project called Beanstalk lost $180m to a 'governance' attack, where the attacker used an instant loan to buy control of the project, transfer its reserves to their account, and then repay the loan in just 13 seconds. And earlier this month, a North Korean hacking outfit named Lazarus stole more than half a billion dollars-worth of crypto tokens from the video game Axie Infinity. Despite the hack being recorded on the blockchain, which keeps all transactions public, the state-sponsored hackers appear to have successfully laundered nearly $100m of the stolen funds already, largely by using a decentralised money-laundering service called Tornado Cash.", "5752b44feb78e3674fdcfdd3e52aa49cbadf05c18abea506e802f4aa": "Photographs found on a phone showing the torture of a woman believed to be a Moroccan-Dutch drug smuggler nicknamed the Godmother of the Coke have been added to the prosecution's evidence against a suspected drug kingpin in his trial in Amsterdam for multiple murders. Three disturbing images of a woman who bears a close resemblance to Naima Jillal, who disappeared in 2019, were reportedly found on a BlackBerry when Ridouan Taghi was arrested three years ago in Dubai. According to Het Parool, a Dutch newspaper, the pictures have recently been added to the evidence against Taghi in the so-called Marengo case, in which he and 16 others are accused of organising six murders between 2015 and 2017. Speaking to Het Parool, Taghi's lawyer, Inez Weski, said the prosecution had no basis on which to link the phone or the gruesome images to Taghi, a Moroccan-Dutch national who was the Netherlands' most wanted man before his arrest. She said: 'It cannot be stated that this phone can be linked to my client. So that link and origin are not fixed. It has been reported in the media before that such photos were going around. Moreover, all this has nothing to do with the alleged facts. It is very remarkable that this has been brought out in this way.' The long-running Marengo trial, the name of which was picked randomly by a computer, has revealed the extraordinary scale and severity of the violence around the narcotics gangs operating in the Netherlands. It has also been marked by the murder of figures linked to the prosecution's chief witness, a former gang member turned informant, called Nabil B. The witness's brother was murdered in 2018, and a separate trial of three men suspected of shooting dead his former lawyer Derk Wiersum began last year. Nabil B's sometime spokesperson, the journalist Peter R de Vries, was killed on the streets of Amsterdam in 2021. When Taghi was arrested in 2019 in Dubai, he was reportedly described by the city's police chief as 'one of the world's most dangerous and wanted men'. Jillal, who was 54 when she disappeared, was known as the Godmother of the Coke or Tante Jillal (Aunt Jillal) in the criminal underworld. She was last seen getting into a car near her home on Gustav Mahlerlaan in Amsterdam at about 9.30pm on Sunday 20 October 2019 but her family said she had not been seen or heard of since.", "367a56530c3c8928a9e2dd590a5056336a12921df6bff1265a9af3cb": "", "068dd7f21064bc9722ef0593a4424231e14b2779744618d6a8821226": "", "3cc61d71e78cc54918be433eb9129341c2bfea1595d3e87092005dbc": "", "dafd1d33b64642cfa490e2cf678d92cef9e3402cf471b142f2f57e1a": "", "cb45b128739b98cf37c8b2cbc9795ef1fd9adb0c0feacbd08538eda5": "", "b7c5c97b1de5b9072566bd3846da77ba7c486d063f35ac08157ede2e": "", "b05509d827583c7dce2cbc5c2d6056fa206fda8f489acccc92c56e5a": "", "83d613decb8795075ed49b60f9cee68c73ff721135b1e30c2f822a4f": "", "aa2cd77c760266bc8810485ec977cb7b19abf2b9ac82394bbb7038e0": "", "c78fcc48a7ff7f1685e15da0b9a1468b010dc5c60861f00a7968a69f": "Elon Musk's $44bn takeover of Twitter and his promises to revamp the social media platform have reignited debate about whether it's time to leave the website permanently. But is that too hasty? How do you leave? And where would you go? It seems every few months there's a wave of people announcing they are quitting Twitter. Some do it permanently, while others make the big announcement only to return weeks or months later. The latest push has come in response to Musk's purchase of the platform, with some concerned it will allow misinformation, disinformation, abuse and hate speech to flourish on the website more than it already does. Musk has suggested he is a 'free speech absolutist'. There has been speculation over who and what will be allowed back on Twitter, including whether former US president Donald Trump will return to the platform, although he has already hosed down that talk. Australian lobby group Digital Rights Watch has expressed concern that while Musk claims the takeover is about free speech, it's actually about power. 'While free speech is important, you have to account for asymmetries of power and other barriers that stop people from speaking freely,' chair Lizzie O'Shea said. 'Musk's style of free speech absolutism will tilt the scales in favour of the rich and powerful who can silence or bully critics. What Musk really seems to want is freedom from accountability. 'Musk's proposed approach to content moderation will likely make Twitter a less safe place for many people to speak freely while allowing powerful disinformation and propaganda campaigns to spread unchecked.' Electronic Frontiers Foundation said any move away from allowing anonymous accounts on the platform would have the effect of reducing free speech. 'Pseudonymity and anonymity are essential to protecting users who may have opinions, identities, or interests that do not align with those in power,' EFF said.  'Political dissidents may be in grave danger if those in power are able to discover their true identities.' Twitter is currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Aside from Musk, who had a stake of just under 10% before this deal, the major shareholders were largely investment firms. The Twitter board includes the current chief executive, Parag Agrawal, the former CEO and co-founder Jack Dorsey, and Salesforce's co-CEO Bret Taylor as chair. It is a dramatic response when so much is unknown about what Musk intends to do with the service. If you've stuck with what many people call 'the hell site' for this long, it's questionable whether Musk taking it over will be some sort of final straw.  Apart from some general tweets around defeating spam bots, having human authentication, an edit button, open-source algorithms and what he says will be free speech, we don't know yet what Musk plans to do with Twitter. If you're set on leaving Twitter, you can first deactivate your account for 30 days before it is permanently deleted. The easiest way to do that is through the 'Settings and privacy' tab in the menu of the Twitter app. Go to 'Your account' and then 'Deactivate your account'. If you go via the Twitter website, you follow the same prompts from the 'More' tab. If you don't log back into your account within 30 days, your account is permanently deleted, and people can register an account with your username from that time. The Guardian asked Twitter what data was retained once a user permanently deletes their account. A spokesperson pointed to the company's privacy page, which details what data is kept on active users, but does not outline what is retained once an account is deleted. If you want to keep a record of your tweets and other activity on Twitter, you can download your archive from Twitter before you deactivate your account. It really comes down to why you used Twitter in the first place. If it is just for breaking news, then you might want to sign up to push alerts from media companies or through the various news apps on your phone. There's always Reddit, where you can find subreddits devoted to topics and communities you're interested in. An open source version of Twitter, called Mastodon, is often touted as an alternative, but it is much more fragmented, with people signing up for specific topics or communities.  The main problem Twitter replicas have had is reaching the scale of Twitter - more than 200 million users - so it's hard to say whether anyone leaving will find something that is the ideal replacement. It's partially why Musk might have been motivated to buy Twitter rather than starting his own social media site, like others, including Trump, have attempted.", "1093612cbc20a0f579006cfaf8b381210667e4a19d4639cf0aeaa241": "A bare few miles inside Australian waters, the dark nearly absolute, a small fishing vessel sat low in the ocean, waiting to be boarded by the Australian navy. Maikel Husa, a slightly built boy of just 15, was among those watching as the patrol boat approached. Husa had been deceived. He left his village on Sulawesi for Java on the promise of paid work transporting goods. The captain instead took on 58 asylum seekers, destined for Australia. When they were intercepted north of Ashmore Reef, in the dying hours of New Year's Eve 2009, one of first things the Australians asked him was his age. Husa, afraid and far from home, told them he was a child. 'I said I was born in 1994,' he recalls. He would soon tell immigration officials and federal police the same thing. Husa told the Australians he just wanted to go home. That's exactly where he should have been sent, according to federal police policy on juvenile people smugglers. Instead, he would spend years behind bars in maximum security prisons in Australia, held as an adult aged 19. Husa is one of dozens of children, some as young as 13 when they were detained, who were wrongly prosecuted as adult people smugglers using deeply flawed evidence to show how old they were. The boys were jailed in Western Australia's adult correctional system before being released years later and quietly sent back to Indonesia. On Tuesday, Husa and five others won a remarkable victory. Despite the passage of more than a decade since their conviction, they argued successfully for the WA court of appeal to hear their cases and quash their convictions, overcoming a refusal by the former attorney general Christian Porter to refer them for a fresh appeal. 'I can say there were systemic failures at every step for these children,' their lawyer, Mark Barrow, of Ken Cush & Associates, says. 'In the end, the six acquittals stand as truth of the injustices.' The court found a 'substantial miscarriage of justice had occurred' and found that, without the X-ray evidence, all six boys would 'not have been charged as an adult'. The court said commonwealth prosecutors now acknowledged their earlier reliance on the wrist X-ray technique 'gives rise to a serious doubt about the integrity' of the convictions and left 'no reliable evidence' to sentence the boys as adults. 'The Crown has conceded that a miscarriage of justice was occasioned by each of the convictions; the judgments of conviction should be set aside; and judgments of acquittal should be entered,' the court said. The case has done much more than simply clear the boys' names. It has exposed hundreds of pages of internal records, which for the first time reveal the full story of Australia's shocking conduct, including the extent to which police knew there were questions about the accuracy of the evidence they were using to prosecute the children as adults. The documents tell the story of six children lured from isolated fishing villages with vague promises of work on boats, only to become collateral damage in a government's desperate attempt to appear tough on borders. Interview transcripts and affidavits show the boys told anyone who would listen - navy, immigration, police - that they were under 18. But in nearly all the cases the Australian Federal Police instead relied on reports from a doctor who said he could help determine a person's age using X-rays of their wrists. Seven years later, his evidence in a similar prosecution would be criticised by appeal judges as 'unsatisfactory and unreliable' and as having 'no acceptable basis in fact'. The Guardian can now reveal that both police and senior government figures were told before the six boys were convicted that there were serious questions about the technique's accuracy. Internal police notes show an investigating officer working on some of the cases had been involved in a remarkably similar prosecution eight years earlier, during which doubts were raised about the accuracy of using wrist X-ray evidence. The courts in that case heard that using the technique to determine age was 'not an exact science' and open to error, and that the key reference tool on which it depended should be used with 'judicious scepticism'. These doubts did not stop police relying on wrist X-rays when they arrested the six boys in 2009. Instead, internal records show, police altered the dates of birth the boys gave them - adjusting the year, but keeping the month and day - to make their ages fit the X-ray evidence and to prosecute them as adults. The new dates, described by the boys' lawyers in court as 'fictitious', were used on sworn legal documents. The prosecutions continued even after the immigration department warned the then Labor government about the reliability of the X-ray technique, pointing out the UK considered it 'an inexact science' with a 'margin of error [that] can sometimes be as much as five years either side'. That warning was given before five of the six children were convicted as adults in the WA district court. In two cases, those of Hamzah Gogo, 15, and Muhammad Maleng, 13, the warning came just a month before they were sentenced to five years in adult prisons. The government did nothing to intervene. Now, senior legal figures are calling for an independent inquiry into the actions of police. The retired New South Wales supreme court judge Anthony Whealy says the AFP's decision to rely on the wrist X-ray evidence, despite questions about its reliability, was 'deeply concerning'. 'Incarceration of juveniles in adult prisons is a matter of the gravest concern, both domestically and internationally.' At 13, Rudi Usman was the youngest of the six. Usman left school after his fourth year and had spent much of his young life working on fishing boats in Oebobo, a village of about 1,000 people on the outskirts of Kupang, on the western part of Timor. Before his voyage to Australia, he earned the equivalent of about $13 a month, almost all of which went to his parents. In December 2009 he was asked to help crew a boat carrying timber. He would be paid 2m rupiah - about $250 - an amount that would transform his family's circumstances. It was only once he was on board that he discovered the boat was carrying passengers - 53 Afghans, mainly Hazaras - bound for Australia. Twenty-two miles north of Ashmore Reef, Usman's boat was intercepted by an Australian customs vessel. Taken to Christmas Island, he told police he was born on 12 February 1996, making him 13. But the date of birth he gave to police was altered. The new date - 12 February 1991 - appeared on sworn legal documents. That made him 18, aligning with the findings of the wrist X-ray, and allowing him to be prosecuted as an adult. Usman was sentenced to serve five years in an adult prison, the mandatory minimum introduced by the Howard government. Maikel Husa's date of birth was similarly altered. He told the Australian authorities he was born on 1 January 1994, but police changed it to 1 January 1990. 'This is not true,' he says. 'I didn't tell anyone in Australia that was my date of birth.' Husa, like all but one of the boys, pleaded guilty, and his lawyers did not contest the evidence about his age. Only one of the six Indonesians, Muhammed Maleng, gave authorities any reason to believe he was an adult, initially telling police he was 13, before saying he was much older because he 'thought it would help me if I was much older. I made up my age.' Husa was sent to maximum security prisons, where he spent more than two years among some of WA's most dangerous criminals. The adult inmates of Perth's Hakea jail had a nickname for him - 'the boy'. 'I asked why and they said because I looked so young. Vandi was broke when a vague offer to work on a boat landed in his lap in 2009. Born on the island of Binongko, the 17-year-old farm worker and fisher had never travelled out of sight of his birthplace. He would soon find himself detained on an Australian navy vessel off Browse Island, north-west of the Kimberley coast. 'I was asked how old I was,' he says. 'I said I was 17 years old and born in the year 1992.' He told immigration officials and police the same. Three days later, police charged him as an adult. The prosecution notice and indictment, both sworn documents, listed his date of birth as 17 March 1990, giving him an age of 19, which fitted with the X-ray evidence of the Perth-based radiologist Dr Vincent Low. Low's report, seen by the Guardian, told police that 'complete fusion has occurred at all examined growth plates. This indicates skeletal maturity and therefore a skeletal age of 19 years or greater.' Police and prosecutors should have had reason to question the evidence. Other experts they had used had expressed concerns about the limits of using wrist X-rays to determine age, including Dr Sven Thonnell, whom commonwealth prosecutors had used repeatedly. 'It really doesn't help at all in determining the chronological age or the skeletal age,' Thonnell said in giving evidence in a 2002 case. Immigration officials had also sounded the alarm internally about the use of such X-rays. In June 2010, eight months before Vandi went to trial, the immigration department provided a briefing to senior government ministers. It warned that wrist X-rays could have an error range of at least two years either way. Interpreting wrist X-rays, the department warned, was highly subjective. Different experts could interpret the same image differently. The department also pointed the ministers to the UK's official guidelines on the practice. They were unequivocal. 'The issue of whether chronological age can be determined from the estimate of bone age has been discussed at great length in the literature,' the guidelines said. 'The answer is that it cannot.' The briefing was provided well after Low's reports to police. But it prompted no intervention from the government in Vandi's case, nor in any of the others. In 2002, seven years before the arrest of Vandi and the other five boys, a remarkably similar case came before the courts. Federal police were attempting to convince the WA children's court to let them prosecute an Indonesian boy, who insisted he was 15, as an adult people smuggler. The boy had repeatedly told authorities he was not an adult. But, just as they would in 2010, police relied on a wrist X-ray, interpreted by Low, who concluded the boy was likely to be over 18. Low's technique involved inspecting an X-ray of an accused's wrist and comparing it against a reference tool for skeletal maturity, known as the Greulich and Pyle Atlas. The reference tool was built largely from the bones of healthy, middle-class Americans. He relied on the tool to say that, on average, skeletal maturity occurs at 19 years old. During the 2002 proceedings, Low himself conceded it was 'not an exact science' and there was a 'possibility of error' in conducting X-ray comparisons. The court heard that the authors of the GP Atlas had warned it should be used with 'judicious scepticism'. The authors said the tool was meant to be used only to estimate a person's skeletal maturity, rather than their actual age, and said there was a tendency to attribute it a greater precision than they had ever intended. While the court accepted the doctor's evidence, it found, given the potential uncertainty and the defendant's insistence he was a child, that the boy was probably under 18. The AFP brought its own appeal to the WA supreme court, saying the judge had not given enough weight to Low's evidence, but the appeal was dismissed. The supreme court judge said Low's evidence must be read subject to 'the cautions and warnings to which I have referred contained in the Atlas on which the evidence was based and must be read subject also to the qualification which Dr Low gave about his own evidence'. Yet, seven years later, the AFP again relied on the wrist X-rays to charge Vandi and the other five boys as adults. AFP case notes, seen by the Guardian, show one member of the investigative team for some of the cases in 2010 was closely involved in the 2002 case that raised serious questions about the accuracy of the practice Vandi's age was raised at his trial, but the court ultimately deemed him an adult. It would take more than two years for the then federal attorney general, Nicola Roxon, to release on licence 15 children who had been convicted, due to concerns about their age. Cases were dropped against a further 48 children who had been charged and remanded in adult jails, where they had spent on average 199 days. One, Ali Jasmin, had his conviction overturned in 2017. Jasmin's case led the way for the current group of six. It also prompted a landmark class action against the Australian government by 122 people who said they were detained or prosecuted as adults for suspected people smuggling. In overturning Jasmin's conviction, the WA court of appeal was scathing of Low's evidence. 'Low's opinion that, at the time of the alleged offence, there was a 24% chance that the appellant was aged 18 years or younger may have been plausible at the trial, by virtue of its precision and the confidence with which it was expressed,' the judges ruled. 'But in truth it had no acceptable basis in fact or by reference to generally accepted scientific methodology. Dr Low's opinion was unsatisfactory and unreliable.' In 2012 the Australian Human Rights Commission released a scathing report, An Age of Uncertainty, which found the method was 'inherently flawed', because, among other things, there was no constant relationship between age and skeletal maturity, and the technique took no account of differences between Indonesian populations and those used as the basis for the GP Atlas. Other experts told the AHRC more than half of all men achieved skeletal maturity before the age of 18. Low did not respond to a request for comment. But in a submission to the AHRC inquiry that led to the report, he defended his methods, saying they were based on an exhaustive dataset and a widely used method to analyse a person's skeletal maturity. Low said other studies showed there was no difference in skeletal development based on ethnicity and people from backgrounds with poorer nutrition were likely to develop more slowly, meaning the technique would tend to identify them as younger, rather than older. He said his opinions left open the possibility that subjects were under the age of 18. 'My opinion and testimony introduces a realistic appraisal of the possibility of the subject being less than 18 years of age due to the normal variation in human physiology,' he said. The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists, of which Low is a fellow, wrote to the government in 2011, well after his evidence in these cases, urging it to abandon the use of wrist X-rays for age determination. 'We advise you that these methods are unreliable and untrustworthy when used as criminal evidence in a court of law,' the college said. The practice is now completely discredited and no longer used. Two memories burn brightly in Colin Singer's mind when he recalls 27 April 2010. Singer, an independent prison visitor in Perth, had arrived at Hakea prison, ready to help anyone who might need him. Waiting for him were the prison's superintendent, deputy superintendent and chaplain. 'Excuse me, sir, I think we have a problem,' they told him. Singer was taken to the prison's medical director. The doctor was distressed. He handed Singer a piece of paper, with a series of names highlighted. 'He had this piece of paper in front of him, and it had the names of all the prisoners they were doing the medicals on,' Singer says. 'He had highlighted them and then he had just written across this thing, 'THEY'RE KIDS'.' Some of the children, the doctor said, were prepubescent. Singer can still recall seeing Ali Jasmin for the first time. 'I remember going and there's this tiny kid, just holding on to this fence. I remember going up to him and saying, 'Hey mas, are you Ali Jasmin?' 'He just burst into tears.' At first, Singer thought the mistake would quickly be corrected. He raised it the same day with the office of the inspector of custodial services and the Indonesian consulate. 'I was an idiot. I thought this is so bad, come tomorrow morning, everything's going to be fixed. Ten years later, we're still fighting the same thing.' Singer tried to protect the children. He watched their cases through the courts, advocated for their release, publicly and privately, and began flying to Albany, where some of the children were transferred, at his own expense. 'The key thing is, from day one, everyone knew they were kids,' he says. In An Age of Uncertainty, the AHRC said the Australian government's treatment of children caught up in smuggling operations was 'disturbing' and that 'Australian authorities apparently gave little weight to the rights of this cohort of young Indonesians'. 'Each of the Australian Federal Police, the Office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney-General's Department engaged in acts and practices that led to contraventions of fundamental rights ... such as the right to a fair trial.' The commission said agencies laboured under heavy workloads, with difficult investigations and limited resources, leading to poor practices. 'Others, however, seem best explained by insufficient resilience in the face of political and public pressure to 'take people smuggling seriously'; a pressure which seems to have contributed to a high level of scepticism about statements made by young crew on the boats carrying asylum seekers to Australia that they were under the age of 18 years.' One Indonesian national, whose case was abandoned because the commonwealth could not establish he was over 18, was incarcerated for more than two years - of which more than 21 months was spent in an adult jail - before he was released without any conviction and allowed to return home. Maikel Husa has been home nearly a decade now. He is married and his daughter will turn two next month. He has rebuilt his life and, like others, says he does not like to think about his time in Australia. 'When I got home, I worked as a fisherman on a small boat. I still do this. I didn't like what happened to me in Australia.'", "c5f3d5fcf42c61b0cfcc69de134867c17af0f086076676a86c1520a8": "", "56130b50c705a442354c95d72b7c51785f5d4463963357468be9bceb": "Thousands of Hongkongers escaping from China's increasingly authoritarian grip on the city have settled in Britain over the past year in search of a new life. This fresh start comes via the British national (overseas) visa scheme. More than 88,000 Hongkongers applied for the BNO visa, launched last January, in its first eight months, according to Home Office figures. It allows them to live, study and work in Britain for five years. Once that time is up, BNO holders can apply to stay permanently. The government is expecting about 300,000 people to use this new route to citizenship in the next five years. Middle-class families and young professionals are fuelling this new wave of immigration. The crackdown on the 2019 pro-democracy protests, along with the introduction of a national security law in 2020, which allows authorities to curtail civil liberties and stamp out political dissent, was a step too far for many. Of those who have left, the majority are not planning on returning. They realise the Hong Kong they once knew and loved has gone. Here, five Hongkongers with BNO visas talk about their lives in Britain and why they decided to leave their home country.   The year before we left was really upsetting. You would watch the news and see police beating up young people. I was afraid for my 10-year-old daughter. I used to be a teacher in an international school. But I wanted to make a fresh start here, so I decided to become a care worker. I love meeting and working with different people. It's much cheaper in England compared with Hong Kong. Property prices are three or four times lower in parts of Berkshire. But being here has nothing to do with money. You can't buy freedom, you can't buy democracy. I can't buy back the Hong Kong I used to have. My husband and I used to go to the protests with our daughter. I wanted the government to know that we were not happy about the extradition bill and how they were treating people. In the beginning, I thought if more people protested peacefully, the government would stop imposing a law we didn't want, but it just became more violent. I remember the day we went to Causeway Bay [a major retail district]. We started to chant slogans and sing songs. Suddenly, I could hear shooting and people started running in different directions. They were screaming and trying to find a place to hide. It was horrible. My daughter said: 'We didn't do anything wrong.' At that moment, I realised we had to leave Hong Kong. I was really sad to say goodbye to my parents, my brother and my in-laws. They think if they keep silent, if they don't criticise the government, they will be fine. I'm very happy here. But that doesn't mean other people are OK. I know some BNO holders don't like it because it's too cold, because they don't speak English, because it's not easy to find a job, or they can't find the same job that they had in Hong Kong. But it was the right decision for us to come. Here, you're not forced to love Britain or the Conservative party. Mainland China will say that you have to love the Chinese Communist party. Even though I live in England now, I'm still worried that I might get into trouble back home if I reveal my name and my face. Some of my Hong Kong friends keep asking me: 'Have you experienced any discrimination, or do you feel like a second-class citizen?' But it's very multicultural here. People are friendly and respectful. I'm optimistic about the future. I hope I can stay here permanently. Before I came here last August with my wife, I watched some YouTube videos to find out which area we could live in. We joined a Facebook group for Hongkongers when we arrived, and we've made some friends through that. Every time I go out where I live in a suburban part of London, I see lots of Hongkongers on the street. I think they may be BNO holders. When I went to the hospital to register our Covid vaccination records, they said they had about 20 to 30 Hongkongers coming every day. Hong Kong is no longer like Hong Kong. If you say something the government doesn't like, you'll get in trouble. Every day you see people getting arrested. I've had some friends who were arrested for being at the protests. They weren't violent, they didn't destroy anything, but they were arrested because they were there. Before 2019, I wasn't the kind of person who cared that much about politics. But one day, I saw some people protesting and I thought: 'Why should it only be young people doing it?' These issues affect everyone. That's why I decided to join the protests. I wanted to be on the street, so we could tell the government what we thought. But nothing changed. My wife and I decided to leave because we want to have children. The education system in Hong Kong is brainwashing kids. A few months ago, a primary school played a video about the Nanjing massacre [by Japanese forces in 1937]. That's crazy. Children were crying. The BNO scheme gives people a chance to start a new life. If the government didn't offer it, most of us wouldn't have anywhere to go. Emigrating is expensive; not everyone is able to do it. Compared with emigrating to other countries, the costs are reasonable. We paid about PS3,000 each. I've heard a lot of stories about how difficult it is for BNO holders to find work. But I was able to find a job as a sales analyst, similar to the one I had in Hong Kong, so it turned out better than I expected. I still check the news to see what's happening in Hong Kong, but it's not easy to access information any more. Most of the newspapers that you could trust to tell the truth are closed and the publications that have survived won't speak out. It's sad. You can't shut something down just because it has a different point of view. At least with the BNO scheme, people around the world know what happened to us back in Hong Kong. I came to England last July. For the past month, I've been working as a regional coordinator for Hongkongers in Britain. I've been organising some seminars for BNO visa holders to try to find out how we can help them integrate into UK life. I used to be an activist. I was arrested during the protests and sent to court. Luckily, I was found not guilty. A Chinese Communist party-supporting newspaper in Hong Kong wrote an article about me, and I was worried I might be arrested again. Most of my activist friends are in jail now. If I wasn't at risk, I would stay in Hong Kong. The government said the national security law only affects some people. But that's not true. It's like a knife on your neck, and you don't know what you might say or do to make it cut you. Everybody is frightened. I still haven't settled down here because I haven't found a place to live long-term yet. I've travelled around from Rotherham to Sheffield to Warrington to Manchester to Bristol, and I've come back to Sheffield. Many people who have the visa are finding it difficult to rent because they don't have a job. My friend and I have been putting on community events in Sheffield for Hongkongers. I've met some people here who understand what happened in Hong Kong, and they have welcomed us. In a few years, I'll reach retirement age. I think England is a good place for people to have a quiet life.  I'm safe now. I don't have to worry that one day I might be arrested. But I'm still thinking about the young people who don't have the right to apply for a visa [the scheme is only open to people over 18 who have BNO status. They can bring over their dependents, but their children can't apply independently. There are now plans to change this]. Young people need it more than older people. I would like to go back to Hong Kong. But if the political environment doesn't change, I can't. I miss my family and my friends. But Hong Kong is very different now to how it was before. I used to hold an event every year to celebrate Hong Kong culture. Last year, some people came who I suspected were connected with China, and took a lot of photos of the visitors. I was concerned about whether it was still safe to organise cultural festivals. I'm also writing a book about the history of Hong Kong. If I want to write without worrying about the authorities, I have to move to a free country. I left last April. I used to work as a research assistant. It's hard to find a job doing what I did back in Hong Kong. But if you just want some money, it's easy to get a job as a waiter or in sales. The British army is now accepting BNO visa holders, so some friends of mine have applied to join. I found work for a few months in research, now I'm writing part-time about Hong Kong and colonial studies. For the first two months here, I was living in a hostel. I started to look for a spare room, which was hard because, at that time, I didn't have a job and landlords need you to have a job so they know you can pay the rent. Luckily, I met someone who was aware of the situation in Hong Kong and told me I could rent a room in his house. I miss the landscape in Hong Kong and living by the sea. But in Britain, you can dress however you like, you can have your own identity, you're free to express what you think. Back in Hong Kong, you're always afraid people will criticise or judge you. Here, people are more tolerant. One time, on the tube, I saw an old gentleman dressed like Elton John. It wasn't Friday night, it was in the morning. People were smiling. If you dressed like that in Hong Kong on the MTR [Mass Transit Railway], people would think you're very weird and just stare at you. I'm here for five years, so there's time to explore my new life and not feel rushed. Also, we have been holding the British passport since we were born, so it's like we are overseas citizens who are moving back, even though it's a country many of us have never visited. We would like to buy a house but it has been difficult to get a mortgage. Banks have turned us down because we have been living here for less than a year. When we came over, last March, a British friend helped us to find a house to rent, which could have been tricky with two large dogs and three children. I'm a housewife. My husband was working as a PR consultant in Hong Kong and found a job here as a project manager for an NGO. His work is quite political, so we needed to leave. We also decided that it's not a good place to raise children any more. Because of the national security law, we have to censor what we say. We have some friends in jail because they're journalists. It's horrible. When freedom of press no longer exists, the truth cannot be revealed. I want my kids to be raised in a place where truth is important. It's sad because Hong Kong is very beautiful. Everything collapsed in a very short period of time. I hope that, one day, it can go back to how it used to be and we can return to the old Hong Kong values, where democracy and freedom were important. Now, we need to educate our kids so that when they grow up, they have the choice to either go back to Hong Kong or stay in the UK. I still have family there, and I want to be able to visit them in the future, so I'd rather not have my name published. I'm worried about my safety. Hong Kong is quite strange to me now and Britain is more familiar. I grew up when Hong Kong was still a British colony, so that makes it easy for me to adapt to the British way of life. I like how green England is. My youngest son loves playing football. He used to play rugby in Hong Kong. Also, here, even though people might not agree with you, they will still be respectful. But it's been hard getting used to the weather. It's quite wet most of the time and I need sunshine! I'm planning on opening a cafe in the future. I want to introduce people to Hong Kong cuisine. Hopefully, it can become a place where Hongkongers can gather and make friends with local people. All names have been changed.", "5c1d418abc6785affb38a4b6a9ba71c95759436e7b3f62f97c1485e5": "", "e6a0f145ad1ab65f8417fbb67088cc7a5835b8e4388175a8c2faa9b5": "More than 5 million people have fled Ukraine and millions more have been internally displaced since the start of the Russian invasion. But volunteers have also been coordinating daily rescue missions to save thousands of the country's non-human population too - pets, farm animals and zoo animals. Organisations such as the Polish Centaurus Foundation, the Ukrainian Equestrian Federation, or the Lviv animal shelter are trying to save animals from the war on a daily basis. They have a large and valuable army of volunteers, as well as funding through online crowdfunding and private donations. It is impossible to determine how many animals have been moved or made it out of the country since the start of the war. What is certain is that there are numerous daily departures to EU countries in public transport, vans, trucks, and private cars. I joined a convoy run by Polish Centaurus Foundation of seven vehicles, made up of people of four different nationalities. It was delivering food and veterinary surgical supplies in Kyiv. The mission was the extraction of the surviving dogs from a shelter in Borodianka, a town north-east of Kyiv that came under severe bombardment. Another animal organisation that works tirelessly in the rescue, care and extraction of animals is UAnimals, a Ukrainian organisation that since the beginning of the war has coordinated volunteers. One volunteer, Nataliya Popova, after seeing how animals from zoos and reserves were abandoned to starve or were euthanised, turned her equine centre on the outskirts of Kyiv into a wildlife refuge. More than 100 animals from there have been evacuated to zoos and reserves in Romania or Poland since the beginning of the war. Among them were seven bears, four tigers and three lions from the bombed Ecopark in Kharkiv. Numerous other animals have been found wandering around the various villages recaptured from invading forces; some were starving, eating anything they could find, others were wounded or frightened and confused by the sounds of the explosions. Many were hiding in their homes, where there was no one left. To the west, the city of Lviv has become a centre of animal rescue and evacuation operations, mainly due to the fact it is the closest city to the border with Poland. Located far from the frontline, Lviv has become a safe place for people displaced by the conflict. And so too for animals, such as the bears from the White Rock sanctuary in Kyiv, where there was a reserve for them, many taken from circuses, which have now been transferred to a shelter near Lviv. Or the dogs, cats and wild animals that stop for a few days at the animal shelter in Lviv, where they are cared for by volunteers who look after them, feed them, walk them and give them affection, while in their offices the necessary bureaucratic steps are taken for their transfer out the country.", "0020cdfae4d977541bca40b518ddfc6a5cd1d2e36f9d195c50f97503": "", "b47bc220f978640788143824ae8d391448233dd4d1e33dee3a775503": "A series of blasts have reportedly been heard in the Russian city of Belgorod near the Ukrainian border while an ammunition depot was also reported to be on fire, local officials said according to a Reuters report.  Regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said an ammunition depot in the province caught fire in the early hours of Wednesday, the news agency said. Gladkov said no civilians had been hurt by the fire which broke out at a facility near Staraya Nelidovka village.  The Belgorod province borders Ukraine's Luhansk, Sumy and Kharkiv regions, all of which have seen heavy fighting since Russia invaded Ukraine two months ago. Thank you for following our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This blog has now closed. You can find our latest coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war in our new live blog in the link below.  Ukraine retains control over the majority of its airspace as Russian air activity focuses primarily on southern and eastern Ukraine, the UK's ministry of defence has said. In its latest intelligence report, the ministry said: Russian gas supplies have resumed to Poland, according to operator data. Gas supplies under the Yamal contract to Poland edged up after dropping to zero earlier, data from the European Union network of gas transmission operators seen by Reuters showed on Wednesday. Physical gas flows via the Yamal-Europe pipeline from Belarus to Poland were at 3,449,688 kWh/hour at 6:22am CET (4:22am GMT). The US defence chief has urged Ukraine's allies to 'move at the speed of war' to get more weapons to Kyiv, as reported by Associated Press.  The call comes after Russian forces rained fire on eastern and southern Ukraine, and fears that the conflict could cross the country's borders.  For the second day, explosions rocked the separatist region of Trans-Dniester in neighbouring Moldova. A Russian missile also hit a strategic bridge linking Ukraine's Odesa port region to neighbouring Nato member Romania, according to Ukrainian authorities.  US defence secretary Lloyd Austin convened a meeting Tuesday of officials from about 40 countries at the US air base at Ramstein, Germany, and said more help is on the way. He said he wanted officials to leave the meeting 'with a common and transparent understanding of Ukraine's near-term security requirements because we're going to keep moving heaven and earth so that we can meet them.' Austin added: 'Certainly we don't want to see any spillover' of the conflict.  Ukrainian refugees face the ever-present threat of sexual violence as they seek to flee their homeland.  This report from Agence France-Presse sheds some light on the pervasive threat of sexual violence.  The United Nations estimates more than five million people have fled Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion on 24 February. Around 90% are women and children, with the authorities in Kyiv not allowing men aged 18 to 60 to leave the country. As the conflict and displacement expands, Colleen Roberts of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Moldova, responds to the most pressing questions about the sexual violence risks facing Ukrainian refugees. A refugee camp setup up for people arriving from Ukraine to Moldova at the Palanca border crossing is seen in the image below.  For the second day in a row, explosions rocked the separatist region of Trans-Dniester in Moldova, knocking out two powerful radio antennas close to the Ukrainian border and further heightening fears of a broader conflict erupting across Europe.  We have a little more detail surrounding reports of a fire at an ammunition depot in the Russian city of Belgorod early this morning.  Regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said he woke 'to a loud sound like an explosion' at about 3:35am in an update posted to Telegram. 'So far, not a single duty service of the city and the region has found the cause of this sound,' he added. The explosions were said to have come from near the village of Staraya Nelidovka which lies about 40km outside the Ukrainian border. 'According to preliminary information, an ammunition depot is on fire. There is no destruction of residential buildings, houses. There were no casualties among the civilian population,' Gladkov said.  Drone giant DJI Technology Co said it will temporarily suspend business in Russia and Ukraine to ensure its products are not used in combat, making it the first major Chinese firm to halt sales to Russia since Moscow invaded Ukraine in February. 'DJI is internally reassessing compliance requirements in various jurisdictions,' the privately held company said in a statement late on Tuesday, as reported by Reuters. 'Pending the current review, DJI will temporarily suspend all business activities in Russia and Ukraine.' On Wednesday a DJI spokesperson told Reuters that the suspension of business in Russia and Ukraine was 'not to make a statement about any country, but to make a statement about our principles'. Ukrainian officials and citizens have accused DJI, the world's largest maker of consumer and industrial drones, of leaking data on the Ukrainian military to Russia. Last month DJI dismissed those accusations as 'utterly false'. A German retailer had cited such information as a reason for taking DJI products off shelves. A series of blasts have reportedly been heard in the Russian city of Belgorod near the Ukrainian border while an ammunition depot was also reported to be on fire, local officials said according to a Reuters report.  Regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said an ammunition depot in the province caught fire in the early hours of Wednesday, the news agency said. Gladkov said no civilians had been hurt by the fire which broke out at a facility near Staraya Nelidovka village.  The Belgorod province borders Ukraine's Luhansk, Sumy and Kharkiv regions, all of which have seen heavy fighting since Russia invaded Ukraine two months ago. Earlier on Tuesday, United Nations secretary general Antonio Guterres failed to reach a conclusion that would aid the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine after speaking across a long white table to Russian president Vladimir Putin in Moscow. Putin described the situation in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol as 'tragic', but said the Russian military was no longer active in the city. Putin's comments come after accusations by Ukraine that Russia has been shelling a humanitarian corridor out of the besieged port city. Watch the video of the conversation between the pair below. ", "221c53af560e44d4acf9faf892778084ba0ff5243280f9e8f594f363": "Russia's foreign minister has accused Nato of fighting a proxy war by supplying military aid to Ukraine, as defence ministers gathered in Germany for US-hosted talks on supporting Ukraine through what one US general called a 'very critical' few weeks. Sergei Lavrov told Russian state media: 'Nato, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.' He also warned that the risks of nuclear conflict were now 'considerable' - a claim Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said showed Moscow had lost its 'last hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraine'. When asked about the importance of avoiding a third world war, Lavrov said: 'I would not want to elevate those risks artificially. Many would like that. The danger is serious, real. And we must not underestimate it.' Western officials have become concerned by the increasing emphasis Moscow puts on its nuclear arsenal as its conventional forces have faltered in Ukraine, hampered by fierce resistance and its own logistical and technological problems. The US talks, hosted in Germany by US defence secretary Lloyd Austin, are expected to see more than 40 countries and the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, gather at Ramstein airbase south-west of Frankfurt. General Mark Milley, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, said a key goal of the talks was to coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that included heavy weaponry, such as howitzers, as well armed drones and ammunition. 'The next several weeks will be very, very critical,' Milley said. 'They need continued support in order to be successful on the battlefield. And that's really the purpose of this conference.' Austin, speaking after his trip to Ukraine, said: 'They [Ukraine] can win if they have the right equipment, the right support.' US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, assess that Russia will now rely heavily on artillery strikes, trying to pound Ukrainian positions as Moscow moves in ground forces from multiple directions to try to envelop and wipe out a significant chunk of Ukraine's military. But the US also estimates many Russian units are depleted, with some operating with personnel losses as high as 30% - a level considered by the US military to be too high to keep fighting, officials say. Britain's defence secretary, Ben Wallace, told parliament on Monday about 15,000 Russian troops had been killed since the start of the invasion on 24 February; 2,000 Russian armoured vehicles had been destroyed or captured, including 530 tanks; and more than 60 Russian helicopters and fighter jets had been lost. Ukraine's foreign minister on Monday urged the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, to press Russia for an evacuation of the besieged port of Mariupol, and criticised the decision by Guterres to visit Moscow first on Tuesday, before travelling to Kyiv. 'Many other foreign officials were trapped visiting Moscow and played around just to show the supremacy of Russian diplomacy and how great they are and how they dictate the world how to behave,' Kuleba said. Guterres 'should focus primarily on one issue: evacuation of Mariupol', Kuleba said, referring to the southern port city where an estimated 100,000 people are trapped while Ukrainian fighters holed up in a steelworks resist Russian forces. 'This is really something that the UN is capable to do. And if he [Guterres] demonstrates political will, character and integrity, I hope that will allow us to make one step forward.' In other developments:", "4ae3df95c25977a32e5e3d6b54ecc1126b32b0272925be4c563793d8": "The German government has announced that it is to send a fleet of around 50 anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine, as it attempts to offset criticism that it has been too slow to provide military equipment to the war-torn country. Christine Lambrecht, the defence minister, pledged about the Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft guns, in a speech to the representatives of 40 countries at high-level defence talks hosted by the US air force at its Europe headquarters in Ramstein, south-west Germany. In her speech, which was leaked to German media and reported widely on Tuesday morning, Lambrecht also announced a range of other measures, including participation in training Ukrainian soldiers in the use of the armoured Howitzer 2000, a long-range weapon, which the Netherlands has said it will deliver to Ukraine. In what is being referred to in German media as an 'about-turn', Germany is seeking to defend itself from harsh criticism from the US and Europe, especially from Ukraine's government, that it has been far too hesitant to deliver heavy weapons, based, Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said, on its fears of widening the conflict. On Friday, Scholz said he was wary of sparking world war three, and of provoking Russia into using nuclear weapons if Germany made the wrong choices. On Tuesday, the leader of the opposition conservative alliance, Friedrich Merz, accused Scholz of being 'irresponsible', arguing that not delivering the weapons would render Germany's deterrence policies null and void, particularly in the Baltic region. In an interview at the weekend, Merz said: 'Criticism abroad is growing and Germany is increasingly isolated'. In February, Scholz announced a EUR100bn (PS84bn) package of measures to boost the German military in what he referred to as a Zeitenwende or new era in German foreign policy. However, a growing number of critics have accused him of failing to deliver on his promise and have argued that only when Germany plays a more active role in arming Ukraine will it be taken seriously and not viewed as being too timid towards Russia. Other aspects of Germany's involvement in the conflict, such as the fact it has so far officially received just under 400,000 Ukrainian refugees over the past two months, according to German police, have not been widely acknowledged. The unofficial figure is thought to be considerably higher as the newcomers are not obliged to register immediately. At the meeting, Lloyd Austin, the US defence secretary, is expected to be joined by almost all his counterparts in the EU and the UK, as well as the Ukrainian defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, and the head of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg. Beforehand, the US government made plain its expectation that European countries would provide more weaponry. Washington has already pledged $3.2bn-worth of equipment. The delivery of the Gepard systems has been under discussion for weeks in Germany. The Munich-based armoured vehicle manufacturer Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) announced its readiness weeks ago to revamp the Gepards. They were previously in the possession of the German army for whom KMW designed them in the 1970s. They would, after a short period for overhaul, be ready to be delivered to Ukraine. The systems had been destined for Brazil and Qatar, where they were to be used as part of security measures for the Summer Olympics and the Football World Cup respectively, according to the magazine Spiegel. The government decision appears to have also been an attempt to pre-empt a motion expected to be put to the parliament this week, backed by the conservative opposition, together with the Greens and the pro-business FDP both of whom are in a three-way coalition with Scholz's Social Democrats, (SPD), which would call on the government to finally deliver heavy weaponry, including both combat and armoured personnel carriers, as well as artillery, directly to Ukraine. On Friday, responding to criticism, he had been too hesitant and vague in his decision-making over Ukraine, including over plans to switch from supplies of Russian gas, Scholz said in an interview. He added he was not driven by fear, but by 'political responsibility', arguing he was 'doing everything in order to avoid an escalation which could lead to a third world war'. The SPD's federal chairwoman, Saskia Esken, had said on Monday there were no plans for Germany to deliver heavy weaponry to Ukraine, but that the government wanted to participate in a so-called Ringtausch, or multilateral exchange, instead. The three coalition partners have requested a parliamentary motion which would give the green light to Germany to provide heavy weapons via an exchange between countries, primarily involving eastern European states. The Gepards can be deployed on ground and air targets, including aeroplanes, helicopters, rockets and drones from a distance of 3.7 miles (6km). Meanwhile other manufacturers in the armaments industry have already applied for export permits for a variety of German-made heavy weapons systems in anticipation of an increase in the German government's willingness to act which has been influenced by a nation's deep angst over its murderous Nazi past. Rheinmetall, a Dusseldorf-based arms manufacturer, has applied to the German security council, under the chairmanship of Scholz, for the permission to export 100 decommissioned Marder Panzer, an infantry fighting vehicle which has been central to the mechanised infantry of the German army over the past five decades. These are expected to be renovated over the coming months, with the first ready for dispatch within the next two months. Training of soldiers to operate the armoured vehicles is also expected to take several weeks.", "1030f8dc6204e63d819c55ad3b8fbef6808226cca9bea88b39cd4e67": "The UK backs Ukrainian troops carrying out strikes in Russian territory, the armed forces minister has said, calling it 'not necessarily a problem' if Ukraine uses weapons donated by Britain. James Heappey said the UK believed it was 'completely legitimate' for Ukraine to identify targets in Russia in order to disrupt attacks on Ukraine. Responding to the comments, Moscow warned Britain that if it continued to help Ukraine to strike targets in Russia then there would be an immediate 'proportional response'. Heappey told Times Radio: 'Ukraine was a sovereign country that was living peacefully within its owner borders and then another country decided to violate those borders and bring 130,000 troops across into their country. 'That started a war between Ukraine and Russia, and in war Ukraine needs to strike into its opponent's depth to attack its logistics lines, its fuel supplies, its ammunition depots, and that's part of it.' He added that it was 'completely legitimate for Ukraine to be targeting in Russia's depth in order to disrupt the logistics that if they weren't disrupted would directly contribute to death and carnage on Ukrainian soil'. He said it was 'not necessarily a problem' if British-donated weapons were used to hit sites on Russian soil after accepting that weapons allies were supplying to Ukraine had the range to be used over borders. 'There are lots of countries around the world that operate kit that they have imported from other countries. When those bits of kit are used we tend not to blame [the country] that manufactured it, you blame the country that fired it.' Heappey said there was 'every chance' the Ukrainians would be able to repel the Russian forces, a more optimistic tone than struck by Boris Johnson in India last week. The prime minister said that a war of attrition in Ukraine meant Russia could grind out an eventual victory and 'the sad thing is that that is a realistic possibility'. Heappey said that in the east of the country the conflict would be between two forces that were 'much more evenly balanced, where the Ukrainians have the advantage of defensive positions that have been dug in and prepared over the last eight years and that's going to make it an extraordinarily difficult nut for the Russians to crack'. 'And with all the support that the Ukrainians are getting from around the world, there's every chance the Ukrainians can see them off,' he told Sky. Speaking earlier on the BBC, Heappey said the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was determined to claim some kind of victory before the 9 May victory parade, a time pressure he said would force errors by the Russians. He said commanders would know it was 'militarily unsound' to attempt to keep to a set date. 'It is absolute folly to launch an offensive before you've massed all of your combat power and that they're giving away whatever advantage they may have won and there's been incredibly bad weather in the Donbas over the last week or two, which means the ground is not conducive right now to the manoeuvre of heavy army,' Heappey said. 'Putin's political pressure and the hubris that he's shown, his desire to stand there on the steps of the Kremlin on 9 May and be a hero, means that thousands of Russian lives are going to be lost and the Russians are going to hand over the numerical advantage that they should have.'", "7b34dea46a95daaf61ef8ea521f075b78cc79c094b24486001cc7ea6": "Forensic doctors carrying out postmortem examinations on bodies in mass graves north of Kyiv say they have found evidence some women were raped before being killed by Russian forces. 'We already have a few cases which suggest that these women had been raped before being shot to death,' said Vladyslav Perovskyi, a Ukrainian forensic doctor who with a team of coroners has carried out dozens of autopsies on residents from Bucha, Irpin and Borodianka who died during Russia's month-long occupation of the area. 'We can't give more details as my colleagues are still collecting the data and we still have hundreds of bodies to examine,' he said. Perovskyi's team has been examining about 15 bodies a day, many of them mutilated. 'There are many burnt bodies, and heavily disfigured bodies that are just impossible to identify,' he said. 'The face could be smashed into pieces, you can't put it back together, sometimes there's no head at all.' He said the bodies of some women they had examined showed signs that the victims had been killed by automatic gunfire, with upwards of six bullet holes in their backs.  Oleh Tkalenko, a senior prosecutor for the Kyiv region, said details of alleged rapes had been forwarded to his office, which is investigating circumstances such as locations and the ages of victims. 'Rape cases are a very delicate and sensitive matter,' Tkalenko said. 'Forensic doctors have a specific task of checking the genitalia of female victims and looking for signs of rape.' A foreign coroner working north of Kyiv who asked to remain anonymous said some bodies 'are in such bad shape that it is not easy to find signs of rapes and sexual abuses. But we are collecting evidence in a few cases of women we believe had been raped before being murdered.' Following the withdrawal of Russian troops from towns and suburbs around the capital, dozens of women have told police, the media and human rights organisations about atrocities they say they suffered suffered at the hands of Russian soldiers. Investigators have heard testimony of gang-rapes, assaults taking place at gunpoint and rapes committed in front of children. Ukraine's human rights commissioner, Lyudmila Denisova, has officially documented the cases of 25 women who were kept in a basement and systematically raped in Bucha, a town north of Kyiv now synonymous with Russian war crimes. Authorities have warned those cases could be the tip of the iceberg and accused Russian troops of using rape as an instrument of war. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in a statement last week that hundreds of women had been raped by Russian soldiers. Ukrainian authorities have declined to give exact figures or details about where the rapes occurred or the ages of the victims. Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilians during the war even as evidence to the contrary has mounted. Tkalenko said women were reluctant to file police reports about acts of sexual violence because they believed the perpetrators would not be caught. Instead, they were contacting psychologists and doctors for help. 'Psychologists work with the rape victims and then with detectives,' Tkalenko said. 'Women are very reserved, and the information on rape cases is more closed.' Much of the evidence collected by Ukrainian prosecutors will soon be forwarded to the international criminal court (ICC), which has launched an investigation into possible war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine. One volunteer who travelled into liberated areas north of Kyiv on 1 April to help evacuate residents said they encountered three naked women who emerged from houses and basements. One had been badly beaten and was taken away by ambulance, they said. The volunteer said they also witnessed about 10 other women giving statements to police about being raped. 'What usually happens is that rape victims initially want to tell their story, but then they go away and it isn't until months later that they come back to talk,' the person said. Tkalenko says that when prosecutors hear about rape cases they approach victims individually and try to see if they will file a statement. 'People are ashamed to talk about rape,' he said.", "10e6bc3a3855fb9f091d55e72a2a8d665d1d1dada3e1993a8e8a085b": "The co-leader of Germany's Social Democratic party (SPD) has urged the former chancellor Gerhard Schroder to hand in his party membership after he made clear in an interview that he had no intention to resign from his seats on the boards of Russian energy companies over the war in Ukraine. Schroder, who was Germany's head of government from 1998 to 2005, presides over the board of the Russian oil company Rosneft and is chairman of the shareholder committee of pipeline company Nord Stream. Stepping down from these posts 'would have been necessary to rescue his reputation as a former and formerly successful chancellor', Saskia Esken told the German public broadcaster Deutschlandradio on Monday morning. 'Sadly he hasn't followed that advice.' In the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine at the end of February, the SPD leadership had sent Schroder a letter asking him to relinquish his roles at the Russian state-owned companies, which has reportedly gone unanswered. Asked whether the ex-chancellor should hand in his membership of the centre-left party of the German leader, Olaf Scholz, Esken said: 'That he should.' In an interview with the New York Times published over the weekend, the 78-year-old statesman-turned-lobbyist sounded stubbornly unrepentant over the links between German industry and Russian energy providers, which was broadly continued by his successor, Angela Merkel, but has limited the ability of Europe's largest economy to meet Putin's military aggression with economic sanctions. 'I don't do mea culpa,' Schroder told the US broadsheet from his office in Hanover, in north-western Germany. 'It's not my thing.' The Social Democrat suggested he would resign from his board seats only if Russia chose to turn off gas deliveries to Germany, something he claimed 'won't happen'. While describing the war in Ukraine as 'a mistake', Schroder appeared to defend his close friendship with Russia's president, Vladimir Putin. 'The image that people have of Putin is only half the truth,' he said. 'Gerhard Schroder has acted for several years as a businessman and we should stop perceiving him as an elder statesman, an ex-chancellor,' said Esken, a leftwinger who has risen to co-leader of the SPD from fringes of the party largely unconnected to Schroder's old network. 'He earns his money through work for Russian state companies and his defence of Vladimir Putin against the allegation of war crimes is downright absurd.' The SPD's traditional belief in a Wandel durch Handel (change through trade) policy of rapprochement towards Russia has come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks, even after Scholz heralded an 'epochal turn' in Germany's postwar approach to military spending. Some members of the Green party and the liberal Free Democratic party (FDP) that make up Scholz's coalition government have openly accused the leader of stalling on heavy weapons deliveries to Ukraine in order to appease his party's old guard. The three parties are under pressure to smooth over their differences at a coalition committee meeting on Tuesday, especially as the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is threatening to submit a motion on weapons exports that could expose further cracks in their power-sharing alliance.", "397fdb721e14431818ce65f4b20245ef54201a4c6f49ec41d957a479": "Time to wrap up - here's a round-up of our coverage of the Twitter takeover: Goodnight. GW This is (quite predictably) excellent: Twitter shares have ended the day down 3.9% at $49.68 each, as the gap to Elon Musk's agreed takeover offer widened. Tesla kept sliding, and has closed 12% lower at $876, amid concerns that Musk might need to sell billions of dollars' worth of shares in the carmaker to fund the deal. Ouch. The Nasdaq Composite has closed at its lowest level since December 2020, in its worst session since September 2020. The tech-focused Nasdaq shed almost 4%, as fears over rising interest rates and slowing global growth hit Wall Street. It's lost more than 20% so far this year, as inflationary worries hit growth stocks. The broader S&P 500 also had a rough day, sinking by 2.8%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 large stocks shed 809 points, or over 2.3%. As well as the tech sector, there were losses among companies reliant on discretionary consumer spending, communications firms, financial stocks and industrial companies. Journalist Jon Ronson, who has spent many years investigating and reporting on conspiracy thories, fears 'free speech absolutism' will lead to a flood of misinformation on Twitter: The libertarian counterargument, I think, is that false claims would be called out and exposed. But experience suggests that untrue or misleading content is propagated and reinforced within groups. Algorithms then feed people more of this content (as that's what they're interested in), ultimately giving it credibility and leading people to share it (etc etc). It's been a rather gloomy day in the tech space, with the Nasdaq Composite now sliding by 3.5% in late trading.... .. while bitcoin has dropped around 5% to around $38,000. Investors are piling into the US dollar, on fears that Covid-19 lockdowns in China will slow the global economy, and in anticipation of aggressive interest rate hikes by America's Federal Reserve. This has sent the pound sprawling to its weakest level since summer 2020, down 1.2% at below $1.26 tonight. US Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer says he hopes Twitter doesn't become an even 'darker' place under Elon Musk's control. Asked about Musk's purchase of the social media company, Schumer gave a sobering verdict on the platform, telling reporters: Since the start of 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic has shown the importance of reliable, trustworthy information online, and the risks created by false claims. And one World Health Organization official has today warned of the dangers of health and vaccine misinformation on social media, Bloomberg reports: Ryan added that in the pandemic, good information is life-saving while 'bad information sends you to some very bad places'. More here. A report from the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) last year showed that Facebook, Google and Twitter had all failed to satisfactorily enforce policies against vaccine misinformation. Just 12 people were responsible for a majority of Covid-19 anti-vaccine misinformation and conspiracy theories, CCDH found. Elon Musk has just tweeted, accusing critics of the deal of an 'extreme antibody reaction'. But as we've been covering through the day, groups such as Amnesty are very concerned that Twitter could tolerate violent and abusive speech against users, if Musk pushed through changes to moderation rules. Rating agency Moody's have put Twitter's credit rating on review for a possible downgrade. Moody's is concerned that Elon Musk's $44bn leveraged buyout would materially weaken Twitter's 'credit metrics', due to the $12.5bn of extra debt which will be added to its balance sheet. Twitter is currently rated as Ba2 by Moody's, the second-highest junk (or non-investment grade) rating. The review will focus on the new capital structure and its impact on credit metrics and cash flow. It will also consider Musk's strategic changes to the social media platform, and whether it will have financial flexibility to grow. Moody's says: Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter is at best a distraction for Tesla (-11%), and at worst a real business risk, our financial editor Nils Pratley writes: Here's the full piece: Tesla's shares are now down 11%, as some traders ponder whether Musk might have to sell some of his stake to fund the Twitter deal (see earlier post). That knocks around $100bn (or two Twitters!) off Tesla's market capitalisation. There's also the possibility that Musk could be distracted from his duties at the electric car company once he has Twitter to deal with. Plus, $12.5bn of the $44bn takeover deal is in loans secured against his Tesla stock. Twitter's shares remain lower today, now down 3% at around $50. Scott Kessler, global lead analyst for TMT sector companies at research firm Third Bridge, suspects there could be job losses at Twitter after the deal. Elon Musk's push for 'free speech' could mean less content moderation, Kessler points out, although that could also scare off advertisers. Also, Musk may need to use Twitter's cash flow to service the debt he's using to partly fund the deal. Kessler explains: Shares in Tesla have tumbled over 9% today as investors fret about the impact of the Twitter deal on the electric car maker. Elon Musk's financing package includes a $12.5bn loan secured against his Tesla stake. It also includes $21bn of cash, which has raised the possibility Musk might need to sell some Tesla shares to raise equity if he doesn't line up other investors.

Ambassador Daniel Kritenbrink, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, was part of a high-level US delegation to the Pacific country last week. He said the US team, which also included the National Security Council coordinator for Indo-Pacific affairs, Kurt Campbell, had a 90-minute 'constructive and candid' meeting with prime minister Manasseh Sogavare in which the US team detailed concerns about its recently signed security deal with China. 'We wanted to outline for our friends in the Solomons, what our concerns are,' said Kritenbrink. 'Prime minister Sogavare indicated that in the Solomon Islands' view, the agreement they've concluded has solely domestic implications. But we've made clear that there are potential regional security implications of the agreement not just for ourselves, but for allies and partners across the region.' On Tuesday, Kritenbrink reiterated the US's willingness to act in the region if a military base were established by China. 'Of course, we have respect for the Solomon Islands sovereignty, but we also wanted to let them know that if steps were taken to establish a de facto permanent military presence, power projection capabilities, or a military installation, then we would have significant concerns, and we would very naturally respond to those concerns,' he said. When asked what that response could involve, he said: 'Look, I'm not going to speculate and I'm not in a position to talk about what the United States may or may not do in such a situation.' Pressed on whether he would rule out the prospect of the US taking military action against Solomon Islands were a naval base to be established, and, if not, whether he was comfortable with Australian prime minister Scott Morrison's talk of the base being a 'red line' for Australia, he said: 'I don't have a lot to add beyond what I've already stated.' In a statement last week, the Biden administration said the US would 'respond accordingly' if China was allowed to establish a long-term presence on the islands, while noting assurances from Sogavare that he had no intention of allowing a military base. The rhetoric escalated in the wake of the statement, with the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, saying Australia had 'the same red line' as the US when it came to China's involvement in Solomon Islands, and defence minister Peter Dutton using his Anzac Day address on Monday to declare: 'Australia should prepare for war', claiming that China was 'on a very deliberate course at the moment'. Kritenbrink also noted China's military ambitions, saying: 'I think it's important in this context, to keep in mind that we do know that the PRC [People's Republic of China] is seeking to establish a more robust overseas logistics and basic infrastructure that would allow the PLA [People's Liberation Army] to project and sustain military power at greater distances. So we wanted to have that candid conversation with our friends in the Solomons. We outlined our concerns ... and we've indicated that we'll continue to monitor the situation closely and continue to engage with them going forward.' The text of the security deal which was signed by China and Solomon Islands is secret, though Solomon Islands MPs have called for the prime minister to release it publicly. 'I think it's clear that only a handful of people in a very small circle have seen this agreement. And the prime minister himself has been quoted publicly as saying he would only share the details with China's permission, which I think is a source of concern as well,' said Kritenbrink. However, a draft of the deal was leaked on social media last month and contained provisions permitting China to 'make ship visits to, carry out logistical replenishment in, and have stopover and transition in Solomon Islands'. Kritenbrink said that 'the United States of America is not in the business of asking countries to choose between the United States and China or anyone else'. But that it is interested in promoting 'a proactive vision for again the shared interests and principles that we believe are vital to all of our friends across the region'.", "49864e6129723dc0f48b926242d61df02529c76227c81cc115336692": "The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has vowed to move faster in bolstering his nuclear forces and threatened to use them if provoked in a speech during a military parade that featured powerful weapons systems that could be used to target the country's rivals. His remarks suggest he will continue provocative weapons tests in a pressure campaign to wrest concessions from the US and its allies. The parade on Monday night was to mark the 90th anniversary of North Korea's army - the backbone of the Kim family's authoritarian rule - and was held as the country's economy is battered by pandemic-related difficulties, punishing US-led sanctions and its own mismanagement. State media photos showed Kim, dressed in a white military ceremonial coat, smiling and waving from a balcony along with his wife, Ri Sol-ju, and other top deputies. '[We] will continue to take measures for further developing the nuclear forces of our state at the fastest possible speed,' Kim told his troops and the crowd gathered for the parade at a Pyongyang plaza, according to the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). He repeated an earlier message that North Korea could pre-emptively use its nuclear weapons when threatened by attacks and called for his nuclear forces to be fully prepared to go 'in motion at any time'. 'The fundamental mission of our nuclear forces is to deter a war, but our nukes can never be confined to the single mission of war deterrent even at a time when a situation we are not desirous of at all is created on this land,' Kim said. 'If any forces try to violate the fundamental interests of our state, our nuclear forces will have to decisively accomplish its unexpected second mission', which would leave any invading force 'perished', he said. The parade featured thousands of goose-stepping troops shouting 'hurrah!' and some of North Korea's most powerful missiles. Some intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) could put the US homeland well within range, and a variety of shorter-range solid-fuel missiles pose a growing threat to South Korea and Japan. One of the weapons showcased at the brightly illuminated Kim Il-sung Square, named after Kim's late grandfather and state founder, was North Korea's biggest and newest ICBM, the Hwasong-17. North Korea claimed to have test-fired that missile successfully last month, but South Korea concluded the launch was of the smaller Hwasong-15 and that a launch of the Hwasong-17 had failed. Whichever weapon it was, the launch on 24 March was its first full-range ICBM flight test in more than four years and the missile flew longer and higher than any other missile North Korea has launched. KCNA said spectators at the parade raised loud cheers when they saw the Hwasong-17, which it said showed 'the absolute power of Juche [self-reliance], Korea and the strategic position of our republic to the world'. North Korea often commemorates key state anniversaries by mobilising huge crowds to boost internal unity. Tuesday's KCNA dispatch praised Kim for accomplishing 'the historic great cause of completing the nuclear forces by making a long journey of patriotic devotion with a death-defying will' to make his people free of war. Kim has been reviving nuclear brinkmanship aimed at forcing the US to accept North Korea as a nuclear power and to remove crippling economic sanctions, exploiting a favourable environment to push forward its weapons programme as the UN security council remains divided over Russia's war in Ukraine. Nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang have been stalled since 2019 because of disagreements over the potential easing of US-led sanctions in exchange for North Korean disarmament steps. Kim has stuck to his goals of simultaneously developing nuclear weapons and the country's dismal economy in the face of international pressure and has shown no willingness to fully surrender a nuclear arsenal he sees as his biggest guarantee of survival. North Korea has conducted 13 rounds of weapons tests this year. There are also signs North Korea is rebuilding tunnels at a nuclear testing ground that was last active in 2017, possibly in preparation for exploding a nuclear device. In 2017, North Korea claimed to have acquired an ability to launch nuclear strikes on the US mainland after a torrid run of nuclear and missile tests. North Korea had halted such high-profile tests before it entered the now-dormant diplomacy with the US. Kim's aggressive military push could be motivated by domestic politics since he does not otherwise have significant accomplishments to show to his people as he marks a decade in power. He failed to win badly needed sanctions relief from his diplomacy with then-President Donald Trump, and the Covid-19 pandemic unleashed further shocks to the country's broken economy, forcing him to acknowledge last year that North Korea was facing its 'worst-ever situation'.", "6ab77e10598b41578327c982d1c398705b60839385a02b827850e060": "", "0dcc8a0b2df4e604feb7e7f955b486738a732c1a70a8d55674f78296": "Angela Rayner has revealed she begged the Mail on Sunday not to run a story claiming a Conservative MP compared her to the character in Basic Instinct, saying the 'classist' comments in the piece were disparaging about working-class people. Labour's deputy leader said she had been horrified at the story, which she had had to explain to her teenage sons. Recalling when the MoS first told her it was running the story, she said she told them: 'This is disgusting. It's completely untrue. Please don't run a story like that ... I was with my teenage sons ... trying to prepare my children for seeing things online. They don't want to see their mum portrayed that way and I felt really down about that.' Speaking on ITV's Lorraine, she said she had decided to wear a trouser suit for the interview in order not to be accused of anything further. She added: 'I want to be defiant because I don't think that women should be told how to dress but I didn't want to distract from the fact that actually it's not about my legs,' she said. Rayner said she was horrified that the story might reflect the public's view of her at the dispatch box, where she has stood in for the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, at prime minister's questions in the Commons against Boris Johnson. 'I just thought, is that what people expect and think about what I do? All I worry about when I'm at the dispatch box is doing a good job and being able to do justice to my constituents and the work that I'm doing. So I was just really crestfallen.' She said she had been heartened by the response from the public and all political parties. Johnson tweeted a condemnation of the piece, which quoted an MP saying Rayner could not compete with Johnson's Oxford Union debating skills. 'I felt really fearful of the story coming out thinking, that's what people think of me,' she said. 'Actually, the overwhelming response has been that it's been terrible that they even printed something like that.' The Commons speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who met Rayner on Monday, has called the Mail on Sunday editor, David Dillon, to a meeting. The Conservative MP Caroline Nokes, the chair of the women and equalities committee, has written to Hoyle asking him to consider revoking the Commons pass of the piece's author, Glen Owen. Ahead of his meeting with the Mail on Sunday, Hoyle suggested it would not be right to remove the pass of the journalist who wrote the article about Rayner. 'I am a staunch believer and protector of press freedom,' he said. 'But I would also make a plea - nothing more - for the feelings of all MPs and their families to be considered, and the impact on their safety, when articles are written. I would just ask that we are all a little kinder.' Conservative whips have claimed they will try to get to the bottom of which Tory MP made the comments about Rayner. But Mark Spencer, the leader of the House of Commons, said on Tuesday that the anonymous Tory MP who spoke to the Mail On Sunday acted in an 'inappropriate' way, but he did not think they broke any rule in the house. He told the Commons committee on standards that he believed those speaking to the newspaper breached lots of the principles of public life, including leadership and integrity. But asked what specific rule they had broken, he said: 'I don't suppose they've broken any rule in the house or committed a crime that could be charged in general society. You know, I think they just acted frankly in an inappropriate way. And that should be roundly condemned.' Rayner said the piece, which mentioned her teenage pregnancy and time as a care worker, was 'steeped in classism' that often put women off achieving more in their careers. 'They talk about my background because I had a child when I was young as if to say I'm promiscuous, that was the insinuation. It was quite offensive for people of my background,' she said. She said she wanted other women from the same kinds of background to feel empowered about achieving more. 'I don't want them thinking they're not worthwhile because they speak with an accent or they've had children when they were young, or they might be single parents now ... [mean] they should be ashamed of who they are,' she said. 'They should be confident of who they are, and they should be proud of their background and be able to speak about it. I'll never stop speaking about mine because I'm proud of where I've come from. 'A lot of women say to me when they see me: 'Angie, you've inspired me, because I can see myself in you, you speak the way I speak.' They see me and they see themselves and that's the biggest compliment that someone can ever pay me.'", "19f7be77b57339d709d61581d91c8e598dc3a85a1fc4f90dddbc9a4e": "", "835c96ca42d2a7bc85c1140471d4528910a17ac258adc0ace950761c": "Humans extract 50bn tonnes of sand and gravel every year, according to UN research, enough to build a wall 27 metres high by 27 metres wide around the planet. Sand is the most-exploited resource after water. But unlike water, it is not recognised as a key strategic resource by governments and industry, something, the UN says, that must change and fast. The UN report makes the case for greater monitoring of extraction and supply chains, measures to compensate for the associated loss of animal and plant species as well as the uneven social and economic impacts of sand mining. Given the extent and growing awareness of human reliance on sand for economic development in industries, ranging from construction to IT manufacturing and a number of other booming sectors, the researchers said a fundamental shift in the understanding and valuation of sand was urgently needed.'If our entire development depends on sand, it should be recognised as a strategic material,' said Pascal Peduzzi, director of the Global Resource Information Database  of the UN Environment Programme and lead author of the report. Sand extraction takes a number of different forms, from the dredging of lakes and rivers to various kinds of land mining and the crushing of rock, and is carried out by both large firms and individuals with rudimentary tools. The current rate of activity far outstrips that at which naturally occurring sand reserves can be replenished.An international standard on extraction is needed, the report said, if the material is to be regulated effectively and governed equitably. Among its recommendations are the establishment of legal frameworks for mineral ownership of aggregates.'The aim is to shift the focus on to sand as a commodity and a material that should be treated in the same light as other mineral commodities - be that mineral deposits, water, oil or gas,' said Dr Chris Hackney, a researcher at Newcastle University and another of the report's authors. 'These are all regulated from the local to national levels, operating within standardised international frameworks. That's completely lacking at the moment for sand and aggregates.'A lack of governance has up to now created an informational black hole around the procurement and use of sand. The Global Aggregates Information Network estimated aggregates production rose 4.9% in the last year from 42.2bn tonnes in 2020 to 44.3bn tonnes in 2021. But the UN report noted: 'Globally, the sand supply base is not known and only aggregate production estimates are available.'Meanwhile, sand extraction continues to drive biodiversity loss, exacerbates flood risk in removing natural barriers to storm surge such as dunes, affects the livelihoods of fishing communities and even fuels conflict. Its end uses are also some of the biggest industrial contributors to the climate crisis, with recent estimates suggesting the concrete sector, if it were measured as a country, would have the third-highest carbon emissions in the world.Emerging research suggests more than 1,000 threatened 'red list' species of animals and plants are affected by sand and gravel extraction - with that figure thought to extend to 24,000 species overall.Yet the lack of formal recognition means sand 'falls between the cracks' of policy and legislative frameworks in many countries, with its impacts hard to grasp for the consumer and previously little onus on or imperative for governing bodies to act, said Kiran Pereira, a researcher and author of Sand Stories: Surprising truths about the global sand crisis and the quest for sustainable solutions.'Personally, I think it is difficult to understand the scale of extraction in general,' said Pereira, who also contributed to the UN report. 'However, this resource is not consumed evenly,' she added, citing the report's recommendations for reuse of existing construction products, alongside incorporation of alternative construction materials and practices in developed countries.The appetite for sand is expected to grow considerably over coming years, with the global population predicted to reach nearly 10 billion before 2050, by which time it is thought about 70% of people in the world will live in urban areas.A standards vacuum also has implications for the human cost of sand mining in parts of the world where governance and oversight is weak and the material is in high demand. More than 400 people in India - including government officials - are thought to have died in violence and accidents related to sand mining since 2020. In Vietnam's Mekong delta, which is normally subject to regulation, illegal sand extraction has reportedly increased during the pandemic, with the resources of authorities stretched and their priorities elsewhere.  The demand for aggregates is again soaring, as governments around the world pursue Covid recovery strategies anchored in construction-led growth.  Hackney said standardisation would assist efforts to establish the extent of sand extraction that was made up by illegal and non-legal practices, which have up to now been complicated by a number of factors - , and act as a deterrent.'Having those standards across the board, the frameworks and the resources for agencies at various levels to enforce them would certainly go some way to achieving this,' he said. 'This needs to come in tandem with improved monitoring of supply chains and scrutiny of links between governments, industries and other interests involved. But, together with that, the kind of top-down regulation we recommend could make quite a break in those chains.'The whole package of these principles would make this activity less appealing and worthwhile for actors participating in it currently.'", "d88741726e4126e03f3bf0b8da13bb131da4ccbb497a55092e79eee7": "Three endangered Sumatran tigers have been found dead after being caught in traps on Indonesia's Sumatra island. One female tiger was found dead, her head almost severed and a snare still stuck in her leg, near a palm oil plantation in Indonesia's East Aceh district on Sunday. Five hundred metres away, the bodies of a male and female tiger were also found, both with leg injuries, according to local police chief Hendra Sukmana. An autopsy is under way to determine the causes of the deaths, said Agus Arianto, who heads the conservation agency in Aceh, adding that several traps similar to ones used to capture wild boar on farms were found in the area around the dead tigers. The species was classified as critically endangered in 2008 by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, when its population was estimated at fewer than 680. Now, it is the most critically endangered tiger species in the world, with its numbers dwindling below 400. Authorities have called the recent deaths a setback to the species. 'We strongly condemned this incident,' Arianto said in a statement. Indonesian authorities have also urged plantation companies and the public to stop setting snares in forest areas, home to wild animals such as tigers, rhinos, elephants and orangutans - many of which are rare. Poaching for profit, and a jungle habitat shrinking at the hands of oil palm plantations and illegal logging, is putting Sumatran tigers among other species under increasing risk. A female tiger was found dead in a snare trap in October last year, in the Bengkalis district's Bukit Batu wildlife reserve. Just two months earlier, two cubs and an adult tiger were found dead in a forested region for tiger conservation in Aceh and North Sumatra provinces, known as the Leuser Ecosystem Area. Four men were also arrested last June for allegedly catching a tiger in a snare trap and selling its remains. Sumatran tigers are not the only species to have been killed by traps. A baby elephant died after losing half her trunk to a trap set by poachers in November last year.  Intentionally killing protected animals is illegal and offenders can face up to five years in prison and a fine of 100m rupiah (almost $7,000) under Indonesia's Conservation of Natural Resources and Ecosystems law.", "176ca3f61530f5fe727dcf9b373976af2e4319ff75ce8dbbd0edb3d2": "The US Federal Aviation Administration has revoked a YouTuber's pilot license after it concluded that he intentionally crashed his plane for the sake of gaining online views. On 24 November 2021, Trevor Jacob was flying over California's Los Padres national forest in his small single-engine plane when his propeller stopped working. 'I'm over the mountains and I ... have an engine out,' Jacob said into his camera while sitting in the cockpit. He then proceeded to jump out of the plane, filming himself using a selfie stick before landing with his parachute into an open field. Jacob filmed the whole incident and uploaded it to YouTube in a video titled I Crashed My Plane. Since being posted online in December, the video has racked up 2.2m views. In the video, the empty plane is shown speeding towards the mountains before crashing into the wilderness. On 11 April the Federal Aviation Administration concluded its investigation into the incident and determined that Jacob had crashed his 1940 Taylorcraft BL-65 as a stunt, saying, 'On November 24, 2021, you demonstrated a lack of care, judgment, and responsibility by choosing to jump out of an aircraft solely so you could record the footage of the crash.' The FAA justified its conclusion by pointing out the fact that Jacob had attached multiple cameras to the outside of his plane, including a camera pointed in the direction of the propeller 'in order to record video footage of the outside and inside of the plane during the flight.' Other pieces of evidence the FAA cited included the sport parachute backpack container that Jacob put on before the flight, his opening the left side pilot door before claiming that the engine had failed, his failure to contact air traffic control on the emergency frequency before jumping out the plane and his lack of attempts to restart the engine by increasing airflow over the propeller. The FAA also said that Jacob did not make any attempts to search for safe areas to land, even though 'there were multiple within gliding range' in which he could have made a safe landing, and that he jumped out of the plane while holding a camera attached to a selfie stick and continued to record the plane during his descent. Additionally, the agency found that Jacob had recovered then disposed of the plane wreckage, as well as recovered the cameras that he had attached to the plane before the flight. As a result of its findings, the FAA has revoked Jacob's pilot license and informed him in a six-page letter that if 'you fail to surrender your certificates immediately, you will be subject to further legal enforcement action, including a civil penalty of up to $1,644.00, for each day you fail to surrender it'. In response to the letter, Jacob posted a video on YouTube on Saturday, saying, 'I didn't think that just posting a video of an adventure gone south would ruffle so many feathers.' 'The aviation community has been pretty tough on me, so I'm thinking about quitting altogether and giving up, just because I'm hated,' he added, while filming himself on his way to the post office to mail his pilot's license. According to the letter, Jacob is not allowed to reapply for his pilot license for a year.", "6cd572d453748116b6d311db1d5d210ec3a9529c4d9be9ce3415a6f9": "", "b7f7fd06faaf8abd04fe4c6f97964ca840e0174f204f350da92cb00d": "", "465e2c4c80d019d911e7fd95aadd580cef36d5d05726603964f9bc19": "Back in the 1970s, when Moshe Ben Avraham was growing up in Port Harcourt, in southern Nigeria, the town was small and fringed by bush villages, and there were no Jews in sight. Ben Avraham wasn't yet Jewish himself; he wasn't even 'Ben Avraham', for that matter. His Anglican parents gave him the name Moses Walison - still his official name - and they raised him as a churchgoing boy. In this, they were no different from millions of others in their part of the country. One of the first demographic details anyone learns about Nigeria is that while people living up north are predominantly Muslim, those down south are just as overwhelmingly Christian. The minibuses sputtering up and down these southern highways bear slogans like 'Jesus is Needful' on their back windows. On billboards, preachers hype their ministries; a prayer meeting is never just a prayer meeting - it is a 'global mega powerquake' or a 'harvest of miracles'. Islam and Christianity have been in Nigeria for centuries, but Judaism has none of that conspicuous history or heritage. In his childhood, Ben Avraham knew nothing about Judaism, and he'd only encountered Israel as a biblical name: 'Israel, Abraham, all those things,' he recalled. Then, in 1986, his father died, and a few years later, in the midst of a growing disaffection with his church, Ben Avraham fell ill: a cut on his tongue that set off a severe infection. At the time, he came across a Christian ministry called the White Garment Sabbath, and after one of its white-robed, barefooted priests healed him, he joined the group. In Nigeria, the White Garment Sabbath calls itself a church, and its prayer halls host icons of Christ on the cross. 'But they told me that Saturday is the day of worship, the shabbat - not Sunday,' Ben Avraham said. It was the first time he'd heard this, but when they offered him proof - careful readings of Genesis and Exodus - he wondered what else he'd been doing wrong. 'On my own,' he said, 'I started to go deeper.' A decade later, Ben Avraham took a further step, becoming a Messianic Jew - a member of a movement that spun out of Jews for Jesus in the US half a century ago, which considers itself to be a Jewish sect that nonetheless exalts Jesus as the messiah. To Ben Avraham, being a Messianic Jew didn't feel very different from being a White Garment Sabbatarian. Both groups convened on Saturdays, prayed barefoot to God as well as Jesus, and slaughtered rams for Passover in accordance with old Jewish scripture. Ben Avraham opened his own hall of worship and called it Ark of Yahweh. By this time, as the century turned, Port Harcourt was heaving with industry, on its way to becoming the biggest oil-refining city in Nigeria. It had offshore rigs, chemical skies and scores of visitors from other countries. In 2001, a Jewish-American executive with Shell, passing through Port Harcourt, saw Ben Avraham's Ark of Yahweh and dropped in. 'He told me that it should be called Ark of Hashem, because Jews don't use Yahweh to call out the name of God,' Ben Avraham said. They kept in touch. 'He was the one who told me so much about Judaism, sent me books and introduced me to rabbis in the Holy Land.' So when, in 2003, Ben Avraham spotted a small posse of Port Harcourt men in distinctively Jewish attire walking into a building on a Saturday, and when he followed them in to talk to them, and when their leader told him that the building was a synagogue and that they'd decided to worship only God the creator rather than the Holy Trinity, he was already well primed. 'That was when I became fully Jewish.' Ben Avraham was an early member of one of the youngest, most surprising Jewish communities in the world. Previously, Nigeria hadn't appeared even on the periphery of any map of the Jewish realm. There is no old text laying down a Jewish lineage for Nigerians, the way the Kebra Nagast, the 14th-century epic, purported to do for the kings of Ethiopia. No Sephardic Jews migrated here from Spain and Portugal, as they did to territories in northern Africa in the 15th century. No Jewish communities arrived as part of the colonial project and stayed after its end, as they did in South Africa. Beginning in the 1990s, though, a number of people in southern and eastern Nigeria have become practising Jews, importing wholesale the rites of this unfamiliar faith and its foreign tongue. Seemingly, this turn has been spontaneous - which is to say, there have been no local rabbis at hand to pilot these Jews through their incipient religion, and there has certainly been no formal guidance from Israel, which refuses to recognise this as a Jewish population. No reliable census of Nigerian Jews exists. The Jewish Fellowship Initiative, an umbrella body in Nigeria, maintains a list of about 80 synagogues, but their memberships are varying and fluid. Edith Bruder, a French ethnologist who studies Judaism in Africa, reckons there might be as many as 30,000 Nigerian Jews. Howard Gorin, a retired American rabbi who has toured the country's synagogues three times - and is so beloved that he's often described as Nigeria's de facto chief rabbi - thinks there are no more than 3,000, although he hasn't visited the country since 2008. Even that lower estimate, though, would outstrip the other major group in sub-Saharan Africa to adopt Judaism over the last century: the Abayudaya of eastern Uganda. Last August, in the Nigerian capital of Abuja, a panel of rabbis from the US and Uganda officially converted 96 people to Judaism - the first such ceremony in Nigeria. Ben Avraham wasn't among the 96, but he is ready to convert. When God gave Moses the law, he said, and when Moses passed the law to the children of Israel, 'the children of Israel said: 'We will do, and we will follow.' If conversion is the only way for us to be recognised as Jews, we will do. No problem! It's very simple!' Earlier this year, I travelled through Nigeria to dig into the extraordinary mystery of how Judaism popped up in Nigeria - a trip that began in the humid chaos of Lagos, near the south-western border, proceeded eastwards along the oil-rich coast to Port Harcourt and then up through the towns of Aba and Owerri, and finished in spare, rockbound Abuja, dead centre of the country. In all these places, there were synagogues - small ones, of course, but sometimes three or more to a city, with congregations ranging from the scrawny single digits to the impressive few dozen. Much of this is Igbo land, populated by members of Nigeria's third-biggest ethnic group. Nine out of every 10 Nigerian Jews are Igbo, and when asked about this near-total overlap, they invariably offer the same explanation. In their tradition, the Igbo descend from Gad, one of the sons of the biblical patriarch Jacob, and a leader of one of the 10 lost tribes of Israel. As evidence, they point to Igbo customs that echo those in the Torah: the circumcision of a male infant eight days after birth, for instance, or the rules specifying when a menstruating woman should be considered 'pure' or 'impure'. One man I met in Abuja had compiled a list of hundreds of Igbo words that sound similar to their Hebrew synonyms. Another played me a video of a traditional Igbo dance in which a man wore a blue-and-white checked wrap - the same colours as the Jewish prayer shawl. Ben Avraham, whose thatch of beard resembles black steel wool, and who teases his sideburns into ringlets that reach below his jaw, is Igbo, too, and when he grew dissatisfied with the church, he began to believe that Judaism could knit tidily, coherently into his Igbo identity. There was still the small matter of knowing how to be Jewish, though, and in this, his timing was ideal. Through the 1990s and 00s, the world shrank so much and so fast that, with the help of remote advice and the internet, Igbo Jews were able to teach themselves their chosen faith. As Ben Avraham was learning - studying Jewish websites, sending emails to rabbis overseas, befriending Jewish visitors to Port Harcourt and pumping them for information - he kept feeling more and more at home. Becoming Jewish, he said, is for the Igbo 'not a discovery. It's a return.' The day I reached Port Harcourt was particularly sunless, its skies dulled not just by exhaust smoke but also by the Harmattan, the winter wind that picks up sand from the Sahara and whips it across west Africa. When Ben Avraham picked me up to take me to his synagogue, his Toyota was coated in sand, as if the original Moses had driven it through the Sinai. From the passenger seat, I spotted an edition of The Zohar, the mystic text of Kabbalistic Judaism, stashed next to the air freshener. A hardback, Ascending Jacob's Ladder, nestled by the gearstick. An American rabbi preached on the stereo. To the dashboard, Ben Avraham had affixed a Nigerian flag, but also two Israeli flags, which twitched in the weak air conditioning. About 15 years ago, Ben Avraham bought some land on the periphery of Port Harcourt, for 300,000 naira - about PS1,400 at the time - and built the Aaron Hakodesh Synagogue. 'I was the only man here. There was no one else in the area at the time,' he said, which seemed impossible to believe, given the torrents of traffic and the ranks of mechanics' shops on the main road nearby. The synagogue's buildings looked rough and unfinished, and shin-high hillocks of construction material sat around the compound, but the hall of worship, with its lofted ceiling, powder-blue arches and tiled walls, was airy and complete. The Sefer Torah - the sacred text of the first five books of the Hebrew bible, in the form of a scroll - lay behind a floral curtain. Up a flight of stairs, a compact library held shelves of religious titles such as The New Mahzor and High Holiday Prayer Book - many of them in Hebrew, which Ben Avraham can read only with difficulty. On one window was a sticker depicting a menorah, a Star of David, and, just in case things weren't already clear, a declarative line of text: 'I AM A JEW.' Ben Avraham's religious journey is a common one for Jews in Nigeria; the White Garment Sabbath and Messianic Judaism are regular way stations for those who eventually join synagogues. Sometimes, I heard this transition framed as a gradual disenchantment with Christianity's contradictions - as a search for theological consistency. If Jesus was human, how could he return from the tomb? Why do Christians worship idols, despite God forbidding this custom? How could the death of one man 2,000 years ago relieve people of their sins today? More often, Igbo Jews spoke so angrily of Christianity as a European imposition - as an alien creed that wiped out their traditions - that their rejection of Christianity really resembled a rejection of colonialism. (It wouldn't be the only time this has happened. Semei Kakungulu, who set himself up as the first of the Abayudaya Jews in Uganda a century ago, quit the church after the British took over his lands.) The Igbo once venerated a supreme deity named Chukwu - an impersonal force that created the universe, rather than an Old Testament God with a personality and a temper. But other aspects of Igbo religion were diffuse and diverse, often conducted orally, varying from region to region, and embedded in cultural practice. Any Igbo looking now to a pre-colonial past to retrieve an older faith in all its lived fullness will find little to guide them. Ben Avraham told me that he'd 'never seen any full teachings of the local story' - nothing that documented in detail how his forefathers prayed or worshipped. 'I only know what my father told me,' he said. In that void of historical knowledge, Judaism exerted a strong allure - not just because it wasn't Christianity, or because its rituals mirrored Igbo ones, but because of the common Igbo lore about their Israelite beginnings. Paradoxical as it may sound, for some, becoming Jewish was a way to define and hold on to Igbo identity. The notion of hailing from one of the 10 lost tribes of Israel offers the romance and the confidence of a link to antiquity. In its reluctance to collect converts, Judaism is also the sort of religion that, as the scholar and minister Robert L Montgomery once wrote, helps 'threatened or unstable societies to assert their distinctive identities'. Small communities in Japan, Kashmir and Afghanistan have embraced theories that they descend from lost Jews; so have people among the Maori and Native Americans. Some groups have even been rabbinically validated as Jews on the basis of their ancestry, and have been admitted into Israel: Ethiopian Jews, or Beta Israel, for instance, or the Bnei Menashe of eastern India and Myanmar. But in the Igbo's declared kinship with Judaism, there is also an assertion of what it means to be Igbo - a group distinct from other local ethnicities. After Nigeria won its freedom in 1960, the Igbo suffered pointed discrimination: pogroms, a weakening of political power, an erosion of their control over oil deposits in their territory. From 1967 to 1970, Igbo secessionists fought - and lost - a war to slice an independent Biafran republic out of the south-east, and in the government's wartime blockade of these regions, 2 million people, possibly more, died from starvation. Today, the dream of Biafra is being nurtured by Nnamdi Kanu, a British-Nigerian activist who wears his Jewish faith publicly. The government's antagonism towards Kanu's movement has made it a fraught business to be Jewish in Nigeria. Several people told me that they were unsettled by growing antisemitism in the country. Most Igbo Jews, as a result, find themselves in a strange bind - believing that their faith and ethnicity have been ordained into a perfect fit, but also wanting to disentangle their faith from their ethnicity's knotty political implications. From Port Harcourt, we drove north-east, deeper into Igbo country, to meet Eben Cohen, one of Nigeria's first fluent Hebrew speakers. Cohen is a pocket-sized man with a towering reputation, and I'd heard about him several times already - mostly from cantors who'd studied Hebrew under him. (Howard Gorin, who otherwise purses his lips when asked about the grasp of the language among most Igbo Jews, describes Cohen's Hebrew as 'pretty darn good'.) Three hours north of Port Harcourt, under a flyover in the town of Aba, Cohen hopped into our car and drove with us through the Igbo heartland for the next couple of days. A twinkly 58-year-old, he is forever attired in a natty waistcoat and flat cap. He spends his days travelling from one synagogue to the next, staying weeks or months at a time to conduct Hebrew classes before moving on. 'Like a better kind of wandering Jew,' he said with a laugh. Cohen grew up in a village named Ezza, in south-eastern Nigeria, but in the late 80s he moved a few states west, to the town of Warri in the delta of the Niger river. Here, while working in a shop selling Nigerian handicrafts, he befriended an Israeli family that dropped by. Struck by his name, they gave him a chart of Hebrew letters, and Cohen - who, like so many others, had marinated in the conviction that the Igbo are Israelites - grew fascinated. 'It looked like shorthand, but it wasn't,' he recalled. 'I decided to learn it. I like challenges.' Through his friends, Cohen fell into correspondence with a Jerusalem institute that sent out books and pamphlets to anyone keen on learning Hebrew. It was hard going at first, but he kept stumbling upon little similarities with Igbo - the 'tz' sound, for instance - that delighted him, and in four years, he said, he was reading fluently. In his book Jews of Nigeria, William Miles, a political scientist at Boston's Northeastern University, calls the community the world's first 'internet Jews'. But even before the internet, others of Cohen's vintage had relied on chance connections, maintained by post, to induct themselves into Hebrew and Judaism. In Lagos, I met a man who - having learned of the Jewish diaspora through an article about Henry Kissinger in Time magazine - wrote to the Central Synagogue in New York, asking for religious guidance. They couldn't do much at a distance, someone wrote back, but they put him on their mailing list, sending him journals and his first Jewish book: a Hebrew-English chumash, a Torah in book form. In Abuja, a man named Sharon told me how, in the early 90s, one Rabbi Jonathan Magonet, at London's Leo Baeck College, had sent his father audio cassettes to help his Hebrew pronunciation. Sharon recalled this so clearly that he reeled off the college's address, a full quarter-century after he last saw it: 'Manor House, 80 East End Road, London.' (Magonet, now retired, doesn't remember Sharon or his father in particular. 'Questions from Africa were very unusual, so it would have seemed important to be helpful but without anticipating much in the way of long-term results or consequences.') Only late in the 90s did questing Jews turn to the internet - to websites like Chabad.com and JewFAQ.org, emails with rabbis abroad, and then videos. Ben Avraham blew through his savings at cyber-cafes, printing out prayers transliterated from Hebrew to English or expositions on the Torah. The cantor at Ben Avraham's synagogue discovered that he'd been pronouncing 'tsohorayim' - a regular Hebrew word, meaning 'noon' - incorrectly only after he watched an American speaking Hebrew on YouTube. The early years were thick with imperfections. No text, however detailed, could spell out every possible instruction, so people made mistakes. A friend of Cohen's dutifully listened, every Saturday, to a BBC broadcast of lectures by Jonathan Sacks, the English rabbi, before realising that Orthodox Judaism forbids switching the radio on during the shabbat. When Gorin first travelled to Nigeria, in 2004, he noticed that one synagogue leader kept doves under the eaves of the building. 'I asked why he did that, and he told me: 'Because it says, in Leviticus, to sacrifice two doves when a woman gives birth,'' Gorin recalled. 'I had to tell him that Jews stopped doing animal sacrifices about two millennia ago.' There were never enough texts or materials to go around. Siddurs - prayer books - had to be photocopied section by section and handed out. Rough approximations of prayer shawls had to be woven. If there was any imported kosher wine in the shops at all, it cost $50 a bottle. In an Abuja synagogue, Miles noticed a menorah made out of Coke bottles welded into a metal frame. The festivals posed special challenges. Through the eight days of his first Passover, in 2004, Ben Avraham served rice and beans, because he didn't know what kind of meals Passover called for. (The facts may have perplexed him further: William Miles told me that rice and beans are permitted as Passover dishes in the Sephardic tradition but banned in the Ashkenazi tradition.) During Rosh Hashanah, when the shofar - the ram's horn - had to be blown to inaugurate the new year, no one knew what sound to produce. A single, long blast? Several short ones? (Later, an audio tape arrived from overseas to solve that dilemma.) When Yom Kippur, the day of atonement, came around, and when Ben Avraham still owned no siddur, they read from the Book of Lamentations instead, because it felt appropriately bleak. On Hanukah, they lacked a dreidel, the four-sided spinning top that is part of a game played during the festival. 'Instead,' Ben Avraham said, 'we used the lid from a pen.' Some of these niggles vanished with time. Rabbis from abroad, like Gorin, offered corrective advice and materiel; twice, Gorin raised funds to fill and send a 40-foot shipping container of books, computers, shawls and other donations for synagogues across Nigeria. Kosher wine got cheaper and more plentiful. Ben Avraham found a man who imported matzo flatbread from Israel. Synagogues bought books online. Other issues persist. Many synagogues don't have their own Sefer Torah. And southern Nigeria isn't an easy place to find a kosher butcher, so many Igbo Jews have given up meat altogether. 'There's not much advice out there on how to prepare a shabbat table, or how to organise a kosher kitchen,' said Yehuditz Derekyahu, a woman who attends the Har Shalom Knesset in the town of Aba. 'And even to go out and buy fish - you go to the shop, and it's run by a goyim, and you see an idol of Jesus on the wall. What do you do? You have to buy it anyway.' She shrugged, but then braced her shoulders, as if these inconveniences were the high but bearable price of re-entry into the religion of her ancestors. In Basel, one night in 2005, Daniel Lis was at an R&B club, where he met a young Igbo man named Levi. Lis, a graduate student at the time, is a Swiss-Israeli Jew, and he remarked, above the music, that Levi's name sounded distinctly Jewish. But the Igbo are Jews, Levi told Lis, who is now a social anthropologist at the Bern University of Applied Sciences. Lis was engrossed. The conversation prompted a line of inquiry for his thesis, sending him to Nigeria and to archives in Israel to understand the origins of the Igbo belief in their Jewish roots. Like so much else about Nigeria, he thinks, this conviction was first fleshed out by - and perhaps born out of - the violence and dislocation of encounters with the west. Even origin stories have origin stories. As recently as the 18th century, Lis found, the people speaking Igbo were scattered across a vast swathe of land, united only by their language and a basic set of beliefs. 'If you'd asked someone if they were Igbo, they wouldn't have understood the question,' Lis said. 'Igbo' wasn't a pronounced marker of identity yet. A clearer sense of Igbohood arose in the late 1700s and 1800s - first in the diaspora that was brought into brutal existence by the slave trade, and then in Nigeria's cities, where people sought work after the British subjugated the country through the latter half of the 19th century. The memoirs, letters and colonial texts from this period that Lis consulted were the earliest documents to draw like-for-like comparisons between the Igbo and Jews. Sometimes, the authors were Igbo themselves, Lis said. 'As they started to write about Igbo identity, they compared their customs to what they read in the Bible about Israelites and thought that some core elements of Jewish culture were similar.' Among the first such narratives was the 1789 memoir of Olaudah Equiano, a freed Igbo slave living in London. Describing 'the strong analogy which ... appears to prevail in the manners and customs of my countrymen and those of the Jews,' Equiano wrote: 'We had our circumcision ... we had also our sacrifices and burnt offerings, our washings and purifications, on the same occasions as they had.' Doubtless, he concluded, 'one people had sprung from the other'. Christian colonists and missionaries nurtured the comparison as well, as they did in other parts of Africa. Emphasising the few loose affinities between local conventions and Jewish ones was a fine way to draft people into the broad Judeo-Christian tradition, en route to the church. But it also gave free rein to the wildly racist theories of Europeans in Africa. Often, colonisers conferred Jewish lineages upon those they deemed racially superior to other Africans. Writing in 1902 about the Fula people scattered across west and central Africa, a British journalist marvelled at 'the straight-nosed, straight-haired, relatively thin-lipped, wiry, copper- or bronze-complexioned Fulani male, with his well-developed cranium, and refined extremities; and the Fulani woman, with her clear skin, her rounded breasts.' Surely the Fula were Jewish, he deduced. Such musty myths of racial differences weren't easy to dispel, and the belief lingers, among some Igbo, that they are fairer-skinned, cleverer and more industrious than the Yoruba, Hausa and other Nigerian groups - and that they would be far more successful if it weren't for their compatriots. By 1960, when Nigeria became independent, the Igbo novelist Chinua Achebe wrote, 'the Igbos ... led the nation in virtually every sector - politics, education, commerce, and the arts,' fostering resentment and 'a lust for revenge' in the rest of the population. When these frictions ignited into civil war, the Biafran struggle seemed to echo the Zionist cause. On the radio, the movement's leaders likened their troubles to the persecution of Jews during the Inquisition. Julius Nyerere, the Tanzanian president at the time, likened the secessionist campaign to 'the Jews seeking a homeland following the Holocaust in Nazi Germany and elsewhere in Europe'. An Observer correspondent, reporting from Nigeria in October 1968, wrote that the Igbo refugees streaming into Biafra from elsewhere in the country reminded him of 'the in-gathering of the exiles into Israel after the end of the second world war'. For its part, Israel sold arms to both sides, but it also offered humanitarian aid to Biafra. One Igbo Jewish man I met in Lagos recalled how, when he was a seven-year-old boy during the war, a bomb fell near his family's bunker. 'The fumes affected my breathing, so my dad took me to the Biafran military hospital,' he said. 'And the doctor assigned to take care of me was an Israeli army medic. It was the first time I'd heard of Israel.' Well after the war's end, the Biafran wish to be an analogue of Zionism - a mission to reclaim a historic homeland - has persisted, and even grown more explicit. A short-lived separatist faction, formed in 2010, was named the Biafra Zionist Movement. Nnamdi Kanu, who leads a group called Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), has often flown the Israeli flag over his compound in Nigeria, and he appears in public with a Jewish prayer shawl draped around his shoulders. In a TV interview in 2018, Kanu urged Israel to 'come and defend Judaism all over the world'. To this, however, Israel has offered no response at all. The question of whether Kanu and other Igbo do, in fact, count as Jews is a prickly one. The Igbo may be entirely correct in believing that they are descendants of some ancient Israelites who drifted down to Nigeria as if blown there by the Harmattan. These peregrinations happened more often than we suppose in the ancient world. But in Judaism, proof of genealogy matters. One perfunctory 2017 exercise, testing the DNA of just 124 men for 'Jewish roots', found none. Even if the sample had been larger, it could, at best, have revealed genetic markers that these men shared with some Jewish populations - a statistical correlation, not clinching evidence that their forebears were practising Jews. Most Nigerian Jews assign themselves to the Orthodox branch of Judaism, believing that the Torah's laws should be interpreted to the letter; in their synagogues, women do not read from the Torah, and they sit separately from men. But Israel, which officially follows Orthodox Judaism, has rejected the Igbo's assertion of Jewishness, and with it, their right of return - the right of Jews everywhere to settle in Israel and become full Israeli citizens. Even an official conversion makes no difference. The 96 Igbo men and women who converted last summer were ushered, by the presiding rabbis, into the Conservative branch of Judaism - which is, confusingly, more liberal than the Orthodox. But while Conservative American Jews enjoy Israel's right of return, the newly converted Nigerian Jews do not. 'According to law, you have to be converted in a place where there's a recognised Jewish community,' Gorin told me. 'But how can you have that kind of community unless there are some conversions? It's a catch-22.' In a way, though, Gorin said, the official status of these Igbo Jews and the biological truth of their Israelite ancestry are both beside the point. When the synagogues are full of people observing the rigours of the shabbat, it matters less if the impulse that brought them there - the Igbo-Hebrew linguistic concordances, or the faith in a Jewish lineage - sounds tenuous. And for all the modern aspects to this tale - the Biafran war in the 20th century, the internet in the 21st - the story of Judaism in Nigeria calls to mind one of the ways in which religions have always spread. A religion may arrive suddenly in a conqueror's baggage, packed next to a sword or musket. But it may also arrive in trickles, as Buddhism did in east Asia, finding political traction and small harmonies with local beliefs and expanding into a syncretic marriage with these faiths. Judaism's strict laws and tight-knit societies have historically allowed for no such accommodative diffusion, but that may shift in the era of the internet. 'For all kinds of reasons, the doors to Judaism have been closed to outsiders,' said Bonita Sussman, the vice-president of Kulanu, a New York-based non-profit that works to bring isolated Jewish communities into the larger fold. 'Now things should change.' An open-door Judaism would also be a more syncretic one - a Judaism with local flavours, of the sort that has developed in Nigeria. On the way to Port Harcourt, I'd spent a few days in the south-eastern state of Akwa Ibom, which lies by the sea just where the Gulf of Guinea indents the west African coast. One Saturday, I went to the Beth Ha'arachman Haknesset, a synagogue set amid patches of yam and plantain crops. The synagogue had raw-cement walls and a corrugated metal roof, but for the kiddush, the mid-morning sanctification of the holiday, we sat in plastic chairs under a blue-and-white tarp held up by a lattice of wooden staves. Any guest from an American or British synagogue could have followed the progress of events easily. They'd have recognised the sweet Mogen David wine (an American kosher brand, after all) and the challah bread (even if they might have found it a little mealy). The attire of the cantors, the kippahs secure on their heads and the four stringy tassels of their undershirts hanging below their waists: familiar. The prayers: familiar, even if the cantor recited many more than is routine for a kiddush. The melodies of the prayers: mostly unfamiliar, because the chief cantor made them up himself, even if he sometimes called into service older tunes. (The prayer Adonai Tzevaot was sung to Jingle Bells.) The junior cantors' infectious beatboxing in accompaniment, and the congregation's women dancing by their chairs: absolutely unfamiliar. The evening prayer service was hushed and solemn, but then the men and women moved back outside for more drumming, dancing and Hebrew prayers sung in hollered chorus. Sometimes they go till midnight, one cantor told me. The next morning, I returned to meet some of the women in the congregation. I'd been wondering if the adoption of Orthodox Judaism had, as a side-effect, fixed women in conservative roles they might otherwise have escaped. 'There are so many rules that bind us, as Jewish women,' Aduja Batisrael, a woman with bronze tints in her hair, admitted: rules about how to dress, or what religious duties they can and cannot pursue. You have to become comfortable with these strictures, she said - and she had. The real problem, her friend Rebekah Baruk said, lies in the barbed reception that their Judaism gets among the Christians they've left behind. Some families spurn their newly Jewish relatives. 'They get scared or confused,' Batisrael said. 'Many people haven't even heard of Jews before, and if they have, they say that we killed Jesus.' Baruk, who runs a clothing store in the town of Uyo, has had customers come in and hector her for quitting the church. These aren't everyday occurrences, she said, but they're frequent enough to persuade her that her new religion sits at an uncomfortable angle within the geometry of Nigerian society. The drive from Port Harcourt to Owerri - once-defiant capital of stillborn Biafra - took most of a day. The next morning, over breakfast, Eben Cohen told me of the time he'd been arrested for conducting a Hebrew class. In January 2018, he'd been explaining vowel sounds to a couple of dozen people in a synagogue in Aba, he said, when a number of heavily armed policemen entered. They demanded to know what Cohen was teaching and had then showed their displeasure with his answer. 'I told them that I'm free to teach any language I want in Nigeria,' Cohen said. 'Still, they took me away, with the chalk dust still on my fingers and the textbook still in my hand.' After eight days in prison, he paid 150,000 naira (PS275) to be released on bail. In the past five years, as Kanu has tied his Biafran ideals to his Jewish faith, the government's jitteriness over Judaism has grown. In June 2021, Kanu was arrested in Kenya and extradited to Nigeria, to be charged with terrorism and secessionism. (His trial is now under way.) The following month, three Israeli film-makers visited Nigeria to shoot a documentary about Igbo Jews, taking with them a gift of a Sefer Torah for a synagogue. Kanu's supporters plastered the trip all over social media, interpreting it as official Israeli encouragement of Biafra, and as a vindication of Kanu's prophecy that Biafra draws closer with every Sefer Torah that arrives in Igbo territory. Nigeria arrested the film-makers, holding them in prison for nearly three weeks before deporting them. After breakfast, we visited an Owerri synagogue called Association of Jewish Faiths. The synagogue's leader is a man named Efrayim Uba, but everyone calls him Hagadol - 'The Great' in Hebrew. Hagadol, in his 80s, has such a stentorian voice that even the most quotidian statement - 'Association of Jewish Faiths, incorporated March 1999!' - sounds like the proclamation of an Old Testament patriarch. To complete the impression, other synagogue members sat around his desk, Amen-ing his declarations. He wore a black robe embroidered with golden lions, poured me whiskey and offered me a nibble of kola nut - an Igbo ceremony. These niceties concluded, Hagadol told me about his 'year of terror'. Last March, after a series of attacks on policemen in south-eastern Nigeria, security forces arrested 16 Igbo suspects - among them, Hagadol's son Micah. He hasn't been seen since, Hagadol said, insisting that his son wasn't involved in any of the attacks. After that, the synagogue started locking its compound gate out of fear. Then, on a shabbat last October, the police arrived. 'More than 200 of them,' Hagadol claimed, 'in four armoured cars. They put ladders outside our walls and climbed in ... They were here for two or three hours,' Hagadol said. 'They made the men march around in a single file.' Were they searching for something? I asked. 'Do you think they'd tell us?' he retorted. One officer demanded the footage from the compound's CCTV cameras, but they'd all been switched off for the shabbat. For the same reason, no one in the synagogue had a phone either. But someone showed me clips shot by neighbours in an adjacent apartment. They were shaky and narrow, but they seemed to bear out Hagadol's story: the armoured cars, the single-file parade, the tense air of a ruptured afternoon. In his aura of power and the spry way he dodged crucial questions, Hagadol struck me as a consummate politician. This didn't disqualify the truth of these episodes or the Igbo Jews' worry that their religious energy is being misinterpreted as a purely political endeavour. 'Biafra is not the same thing as Judaism,' Ben Avraham said. Barely three decades into their new ways of worship, Nigeria's Jews already find themselves beset by political anxieties - which only convinces them even more strongly of their Jewishness, and of their intense connection with other Jews out there in the world. The oldest synagogue in Nigeria, the Gihon Hebrews Synagogue, perches on the flank of a steep hill in Abuja. It was founded, nominally, in 1990 - even if it started in that year as three Messianic Jewish families gathering in a friend's flat, before the members found mainstream Judaism in 1997 and built the synagogue's two brick buildings in 2005. Towards the end of my journey, I attended shabbat here. After the morning service, most of my Saturday was spent with the 30-strong congregation in a square hall with blue and white chairs and hand-lettered charts of the Hebrew alphabet on the walls. Through the door, we could see the small, dusty roofs of houses in the valley below; behind us, the rock face reached up to the highway above. A long-faced cantor delivered a sharp, short kiddush: just the one song, its refrain sung back to him by the assembly in practised unison. When I mentioned to the man on my right that I'd seen a kiddush in Akwa Ibom that ran nearly two hours, with plenty of singing and dancing, he snuffled in disapproval: 'That's how they are in Akwa Ibom. They bring music into everything.' (Gihon was strict with its rules when it came to me, too. No photos or voice recordings on my phone, I'd been told, and no taking notes - in fact, no formal interviews of any kind. Any shred of work would violate the shabbat.) After the wine had been blessed and drunk, one of the men, wearing a black hat and coat in the Abuja heat, rose to deal with synagogue business. The festival of Purim was coming up, and Passover after that, he said, urging members to donate generously. 'Covid is not over. Please continue to wear your masks. Be responsible, be the Jews that you're meant to be.' The air was still, the light bright. In one corner, a woman cooed to a baby wearing a kippah. Later in the afternoon, there were discussions on the Torah and other canonical texts: questions and spirited answers about the ideal synagogue, or about the precise years of the creation and the birth of Jesus (or 'J5', as they cryptically called him). But before that, over the shabbat meal of fish stew and rice, I talked to the man sitting next to me. Ariel, who works as an estate agent in Abuja, said that he'd once been an 'Igbo traditionalist', following a medley of old social customs without really knowing them as part of a grander Igbo faith. A religion demands a community, and Ariel felt the Igbo lacked that. 'There was no place for us to meet, for example - no temple, nothing like that,' he said. Then, 18 years ago, he decided to be Jewish. 'I found people to be with.' Ariel wasn't quite sure that he and his fellow Jews had as yet grasped the full expanse of their faith's history and practice, and certainly the lack of encouragement from Israel rankled. But on both counts, he was prepared to take the long view. 'When Moses led the Jews out of Egypt, they had no synagogues,' he said. 'It was only afterwards that they built synagogues. We're like that, too. We are in transition. We're becoming Jewish. We're getting there.'

He recently returned to the country, after serving as high commissioner to Ghana, and was disheartened by what he found. Andrews believes the state of the country's natural wildlife and biodiversity is the 'worst it's ever been' and calls the ongoing destruction of forests and other habitat 'crazy'. After a political term marked by consecutive summer disasters and multiple official reports highlighting government failure, he sees it as a major issue. But, as far as the first two weeks of the election campaign are concerned, the environment may as well not exist. 'Biodiversity and nature have been completely absent from this campaign so far,' he says. 'That makes me really sad because Australians define ourselves through our wildlife. We've got them on our money, our sports teams, our coat of arms, the tail of Qantas. We can't keep defining ourselves by our wildlife when we're losing it to extinction.' Given so much of Australia's landscape had already been cleared, he believes the time has come for a conversation about sharing what remains with the country's unique, and increasingly struggling, wildlife. 'If we're serious about what it means to be Australian ... we are a rich enough country with enough habitat and enough cleared area to dedicate the remaining land to protection,' he says. 'The trouble is the Greens are the only party that says that, and it is seen as a fringe or extremist position.' Andrews spent three years as threatened species commissioner. He says while he was proud of some of the things that were achieved under Hunt, he felt restricted due to climate denialism within the Coalition and the refusal to deal with habitat degradation. He is not alone in raising concerns about the environment missing from the campaign. Others are also trying to raise its profile. A new report from a coalition of conservation groups says if Australia was serious about nature protection, it would increase its spending ten-fold. It highlights 100 animals and plants - including the orange-bellied parrot and the grassland earless dragon - that are at imminent risk of extinction. The South Australian independent senator Rex Patrick this week called for a change in the way the environment is treated in the next parliament, including requiring the prime minister to make an annual extinction statement, listing the species newly declared as either extinct or critically endangered. The question is: is anyone listening? That Australia is not doing enough to protect its environment is well known. In the past term alone, three official reports, two from the Australian National Audit Office plus the independent review of Australia's environmental laws by the former competition watchdog head Graeme Samuel, highlighted a litany of environmental failures. A fourth, the five-yearly State of the Environment report, is also expected to highlight the ongoing decline. That report could have been tabled by the Morrison government before the campaign began but has been withheld. The rate of land-clearing in states such as Queensland and New South Wales has been increasing and the addition of new species to Australia's national list of threatened wildlife was accelerated by the country's worst bushfire disaster. The Australian Capital Territory's faunal emblem, the gang-gang cockatoo, entered the list as endangered, with the expert scientific committee highlighting the climate crisis as the major driver of reductions to populations of the bird. And a week before the election was called, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change again sounded the alarm that the world was rapidly running out of time to limit warming to 1.5C. That the climate and nature crises are intertwined is acknowledged globally. But the conversation about either of these issues in the campaign so far has been characterised by commentary on power bills, based on unsourced modelling, and a $220m pledge by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, for native forestry in Tasmania. Before the election was called, the Morrison government also promised $50m for a single species, the koala, which had its conservation status upgraded in February from vulnerable to endangered. Carol Booth, the principal policy analyst at the Invasive Species Council, says the silence from the major parties on what the next government will do to change the trajectory reveals a lot. 'They're obviously making a judgment that it's not going to turn the election for them,' she says. 'They pay attention to individual crises, like the fires. But because it's a long term, insidious problem and there are so many threats coalescing and interacting ... it's hard to get your head around. 'You're not going to see results in one term of government.' The council - backed by BirdLife Australia, Bush Heritage, the Humane Society International and the Australian Land Conservation Alliance - has released a new report that notes extinctions are expected to dramatically escalate in Australia over the next two decades due to Australia's failure to deal with the major threats of invasive species, habitat destruction and climate change. It identifies 100 species that have a high risk of extinction in that time, including 20 freshwater fish, nine birds, eight frogs, six reptiles, one mammal and one butterfly with a greater than 50% risk of extinction within 20 years, and 55 plants at high risk of extinction within 10. It argues an overhaul of Australia's threat abatement system is necessary after years of neglect, evidenced by overdue and outdated species recovery plans and the near decade-long failure by the Coalition to formally list major threats. That streak was finally broken this week after fire regimes that cause wildlife decline was officially listed as a key threat to Australia's environment, 14 years after it was first proposed. The environment minister, Sussan Ley, signed off on the decision shortly before the election was called. The Invasive Species Council's report puts forward solutions, including that governments simply apply the laws and protections they have neglected for so long. That is, systematically listing major threats and developing and implementing plans to tackle them as well as recover species. And it reiterates earlier work by a group of scientists led by the conservation ecologist Brendan Wintle that found Australia needed a ten-fold increase in nature spending to recover endangered wildlife. Booth says this would require expenditure of about $1.5bn to $2bn annually. 'That's not much in terms of the whole budget but it's a lot more than they've committed to date,' she says. Samantha Vine, the head of conservation and science at BirdLife Australia, says most voters care about nature, but that passion is not always visible to politicians. She says when governments do make the effort to tackle threats, the trajectory of species facing extinction can be turned around. On Macquarie Island, for example, breeding populations of grey-headed albatross are recovering after governments prioritised the eradication of rodents and rabbits on the island. 'It shows what can happen if you just invest in the work that needs to be done,' she says. Guardian Australia asked the Coalition, Labor and the Greens about their priorities for nature. Much of the Morrison government's term has focused on its environmental deregulation agenda and a bid to transfer environmental approval powers to the states and territories. But Ley says it has also 'delivered more than $6bn in environmental spending since 2019' and points to budget announcements of $1bn for the Great Barrier Reef and $100m for the Environment Restoration Fund. As minister, she established a new 10-year threatened species strategy and delivered a long-awaited recovery plan for the koala. 'The Morrison government is committed to practical action and to working with communities, land managers, traditional owners and scientists to protect the environment, from our heritage places to the health of our oceans and native species,' she says. Labor's environment spokesperson, Terri Butler, says the party will have more to say about the environment closer to the election, but has already committed to increased funding for Indigenous rangers and Indigenous Protected Areas as well as $200m for urban rivers and catchments. She says the Australia State of the Environment Report, which Ley was sitting on, should be made public. 'Protecting and restoring the environment has never been more important after bushfires and floods,' Butler says. 'The environment cannot afford to have the Morrison-Joyce government mismanage [it] for another term.' The Greens environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, says the party has been 'fighting against the Liberal-Nationals attacks on our environment since they came to power'. 'Our environment is in crisis and the Greens are crucial to protecting it in the parliament,' she says. She says the Greens have the most comprehensive policy of the parties for protecting the environment, which includes a zero extinction target and a commitment to end habitat destruction. This week Rex Patrick, who is fighting to keep his seat, said if reelected he would move for the prime minister to be 'personally accountable for Australia's irrevocable environmental failures'. Patrick wants to create a requirement in Australia's environmental laws stating the prime minister must table an annual extinction and endangered species statement to parliament listing the species newly declared as either extinct or critically endangered. 'No prime minister is going to be very keen to stand up in the parliament and sound the death knell for unique Australian species,' he said. 'But that is what's likely to be required to focus the minds of governments to take action before the irrevocable point of extinction is reached.'", "e714bdeb2e5983a92a6527ae1e2de91248828d2a2ae2a427fe7005ba": "The nature guides are waiting outside a Taiwanese fried sausage shop on the outskirts of Taipei, easily identified by their quick-dry clothing, microphones, and laminated sheets of QR codes. They are also carrying several enlarged photos of insects. A  group of about 50 excited people soon gathers, ready to start trudging up a nearby mountain in the dark. It is a ritual repeated across Taiwan at this time of year, as hundreds of thousands of people flock to more than 30 sites like this one, in Xindian. They gather in the hope of witnessing the twinkling lights of fireflies, a natural phenomenon that is beautiful, captivating, and under threat. The guides say they cannot guarantee the group will see any, but people are hopeful. The conditions are ideal: a last burst of winter gave up overnight and it's clearand muggy. 'If we see the fireflies, we're lucky. If we don't, we're hiking,' says the guide. The lights the group is looking for are a firefly courtship routine lasting just two to four weeks, as males show off to potential mates by making their abdomens glow green or a warm red. As dusk settles the first of dozens of groups with dozens of people - from toddlers in prams to elderly couples - begin the 90-minute hike along the Hemeishan trail through an abandoned amusement park and into the jungle. On the walk up, observers rush to a ditch to marvel at the first sighting: just two or three fireflies hovering around the undergrowth. But by the time night has fallen and the walkers have stumbled their way to trail peak's plateau, they are surrounded by blinking lights dancing over marshy ponds in the darkness. Taiwan is home to about 65 of the world's estimated 2,200 species of firefly. In terms of density, it ranks behind only Jamaica and Costa Rica, with two species for every 1,000 square kilometre. But global populations are under threat from habitat destruction and pesticides, as well as water, air and light pollution. 'The fundamental problem is visibility,' wrote Tufts University firefly experts, Avalon CS Owens and Sara Lewis, in the Conversation last year. 'Fireflies use their bioluminescence to flirt in the dark. It doesn't work so well with the lights on.' Climate change is also a concern, says Dr Wu Chia-Hsiung, an expert on fireflies from the National Taiwan University. '[Fireflies] like to hatch in a wet and humid area, so if climate change makes a place too dry [they won't hatch].' He notes the Taiwan drought of 2020-21, its worst in 50 years. But conservationists and volunteers are fighting to save them. In the centre of the Taipei, conservationists with the Friends of Daan Forest Park Foundation have successfully reintroduced fireflies after almost a century.  In 2014, the group formed under Wu's training to restore natural habitats, replace bright streetlights with firefly-friendly globes, and lead tour groups. Their success has led to delegations from Hong Kong, Singapore and Bangkok visiting to learn from them. They run the nightly tours during the season, with as many as 500 people on weekdays, and 1,000 at weekends. 'It's a childhood memory for those over 50, and before 2014 many of them thought it would be impossible to see them again,' says Wu. 'We brought them back. It's an ecological miracle.' There is massive community interest. A review of pre-pandemic firefly tourism estimated at least one million people travelled annually to sites across 12 countries to see the fireflies each year, including hundreds of thousands in Taiwan. Conservation groups and guides have worked to minimise the impact, limiting numbers and staggering start times for groups, and encourage people to stick to paths and not use torches, flash photography or wear insect spray. Dozens of people on Hemei mountain are here for the tricky but rewarding photo opportunities. Betty, a retired woman from Taipei, has spent the evening sitting in a small camping chair next to a flat patch of long grass and ferns. Her iPhone stands on a short tripod, its screen displaying a frankly stunning photo taken using a slow shutter app.  'It's just like when people see shooting stars, you're super-excited. This is only once a year and the time is very short.' In Daan Park, crowds gather in the twilight by the ecological ponds, drawn in by the foundation's own firefly song - a tune in multiple languages written by winners of a competition with $600,000 in prize money. It plays on a loop. Energy and hopes are high: it's another warm night and despite a growing Covid outbreak, the usually cautious people of Taipei have turned out in droves. Lou-ann Fu Yen-fen, a retired banker who has volunteered with the foundation for six years, says it's been an honour to show people the fireflies in the city centre. 'I believe in live and learn. For my generation, if we lived in the suburbs we saw the fireflies so naturally. We took it for granted. Young people live in the city and have never seen it before. If they learn to live in harmony with the environment they will treasure it.'", "4e08af27acc93bf265e651bfbed104bbd1716f8134243a6584825871": "A New York judge has held Donald Trump in contempt and fined him $10,000 a day, following the former president's failure to hand over documents to prosecutors investigating his business practices. Letitia James, the New York state attorney general, had asked for the contempt finding this month stating that Trump had not complied with a subpoena requiring him to produce documents and information. James'   civil investigation has focused on whether the Trump Organization misstated the values of its real estate properties to obtain favorable loans and tax deductions. Earlier in April James said investigators had found 'significant evidence' of wrongdoing. In a court filing then, the New York attorney general said Trump failed to abide by his earlier agreement to comply 'in full' with her subpoena for documents and information by 31 March. On Monday, Judge Arthur Engoron, a New York state supreme court judge, agreed with James that Trump was in contempt of court. 'Mr Trump, I know you take your business seriously, and I take mine seriously. I hereby hold you in civil contempt and fine you $10,000 a day,' Engoron said in a hearing. James previously said her investigation had found evidence suggesting that for more than a decade the company's financial statements 'relied on misleading asset valuations and other misrepresentations to secure economic benefits'. In mid-April, an attorney for Trump said his team had tried to comply with the subpoena, but despite 'a diligent search', the legal team had found Trump 'is not in possession of any of the requested documents'. CBS News reported that Alina Habba, Trump's attorney, said Trump's company might have the requested documents, which include tax audit materials, instead. Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing. He has called the investigation a 'witch-hunt'. In a court filing then, James said Trump had failed to abide by his earlier agreement to comply 'in full' with her subpoena for documents and information by 31 March. James asked that Trump be fined $10,000 a day until he complied. 'The judge's order was crystal clear: Donald J Trump must comply with our subpoena and turn over relevant documents to my office,' James said in a statement. James's three-year investigation and a parallel criminal inquiry led by the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, have focused on whether the Trump Organization misstated the values of its real estate properties to obtain favorable loans and tax deductions. Bragg has been dogged, however, by resignations by senior prosecutors involved in the case, while insisting his investigation was continuing. Trump's legal woes are rapidly engulfing him. Earlier, James said her investigation had found 'significant evidence' suggesting that for more than a decade the company's financial statements 'relied on misleading asset valuations and other misrepresentations to secure economic benefits'. On Monday, James said in a statement after Engoron's ruling: 'Today, justice prevailed. For years, Donald Trump has tried to evade the law and stop our lawful investigation into him and his company's financial dealings. Today's ruling makes clear: no one is above the law.' The contempt finding by the judge came despite a spirited argument by Habba, who insisted repeatedly that she went to great lengths to comply with the subpoena, even traveling to Florida to ask Trump specifically whether he had in his possession any documents that would be responsive to the demand. 'The contempt motion is inappropriate and misleading,' she said. 'He complied ... There are no more documents left to produce by President Trump.' She also derided the James investigation as 'political' and 'truly a fishing expedition,' saying Trump and his companies had turned over more than six million documents and paperwork related to 103 Trump entities over an eight-year period. Trump spokespeople did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the James case or his other legal challenges.", "20eb68197cedec24be2b30698e680f333ca2169d502e68bb5cc21559": "Days before Joe Biden's presidential inauguration, Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene appeared in a text to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to press for Donald Trump to overturn his 2020 election defeat by invoking martial law, new messages show. The message - one of more than 2,000 texts turned over by Meadows to the House select committee investigating January 6 and first reported by CNN - shows that some of Trump's most ardent allies on Capitol Hill were pressing for Trump to return himself to office even after the Capitol attack. 'In our private chat with only Members several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call Marshall [sic] law,' Greene texted on 17 January. 'I just wanted you to tell him. They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next.' The message about Trump potentially invoking martial law, earlier reported by CNN on Monday and confirmed by the Guardian, came a month after the idea had been raised in a heated Oval Office meeting a month before, where Trump considered ways to overturn the 2020 election. Meadows did not appear to respond to Greene's text. But the messages Trump's top White House aide was receiving shows the extraordinary ideas swirling around Trump after he and his operatives were unable to stop the certification of Biden's election win on January 6. Greene - one of Trump's fiercest far-right defenders on Capitol Hill - also texted Meadows days before the Capitol attack asking about how to prepare for objections to Biden's win at the joint session of Congress, the text messages show. 'Good morning Mark, I'm here in DC. We have to get organized for the 6th,' Greene wrote on 31 December. 'I would like to meet with Rudy Giuliani again. We didn't get to speak with him long. Also anyone who can help. We are getting a lot of members on board.' That text message from Greene, who had not yet been sworn in as a member of Congress, a week before the Capitol attack also underscores her close relationship with the Trump White House and an extraordinary level of coordination to obstruct Biden being certified as president. But the text messages that Meadows did not turn over to the select committee - as opposed to the communications he agreed to produce for the investigation - were perhaps more notable as the panel investigates connections between the White House and the Capitol attack. The panel is aware, for instance, that Meadows had contacts through December 2020 and January 2021 with organizers of the Save America rally at the Ellipse that descended into the Capitol attack as well as with Trump campaign officials, say sources close to the inquiry. Yet none of the text messages Meadows produced to the select committee through a cooperation deal agreed last year and in response to a subpoena show any such contacts, raising the specter that he might have deliberately withheld some communications. The former White House chief of staff appears to have ultimately turned over no text messages between 9 December and 21 December, a critical time period in the lead-up to the Capitol attack during which a number of key moments took place. Meadows appeared to be aware of efforts by the White House and others, for instance, to send fake Trump slates of electors to Congress. The idea was to have 'dueling' slates of electors force then-vice president Mike Pence to discount those votes and return Trump to office. That scheme - which the select committee believes was coordinated in part by the Trump White House, the sources said - appeared to occur on 14 December, the deadline under the Electoral Count Act for states to send electoral college votes to Congress. Meadows also was in close contact with Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani and others after the contentious Oval Office meeting with Trump on 18 December, as he sought to bar onetime Trump campaign lawyer and conspiracy theorist Sidney Powell from the White House. But Meadows appears to have turned over no text messages from that crucial period, as allies of the former president started to set their sights on January 6, including the Stop the Steal movement that started to plan a protest at the Capitol around that time. The seeming omission may be explained in part by the fact that Meadows was communicating about those plans on his personal cell phone - against which the select committee issued a subpoena contested by Meadows in federal court as 'overly broad'. The absence of messages between 9 December and 21 December may also be explained more straightforwardly by the fact that Meadows did not receive any messages during that period. Meadows' lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment. House investigators are not convinced they have been given all the text messages relevant to their subpoena, according to one source with knowledge of the matter, and expect to continue pursuing Meadows' documents and personal communications in court. In a motion for summary judgment with respect to Meadows' records, the select committee said in a 248-page court filing late on Friday that it believed Meadows' claims for withholding material from the investigation on grounds of executive privilege were baseless.", "f277d771e889d028ff943b32483c703d2d08d024ee317a0858a5eefe": "", "7b70e97ecfdb17655fbe0d5a46338b49ee945dc4a8510a9c9e87519c": "A United Nations team is in China ahead of a visit to Xinjiang, in preparation for the human rights commissioner's long sought inspection expected next month. The delegation was quarantining in Guangzhou, the South China Morning Post reported, before heading to Xinjiang. The five-member team was there 'at the invitation of the [Chinese] government' said Liz Throssell, UN human rights spokesperson, the Post reported. The UN office of the human rights commissioner (OHRC) has been negotiating with the Chinese government since 2018 seeking to visit Xinjiang with 'unfettered, meaningful access' and the freedom to interview civil society groups without supervision. In March, UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said the OHRC had 'reached an agreement' with the Chinese government to visit in May. No human rights commissioner has visited China since 2005. At the time Throssell said both the advance team and Bachelet 'will go or are due to go to Xinjiang, and obviously visit Beijing and other locations'. She said negotiations had produced 'an agreement on the parameters that respect our methodology', including 'unfettered access to a broad range of actors, including civil society'. A spokesperson for China's ministry of foreign affairs, Wang Wenbin, confirmed the UN team arrived on Monday. 'What I want to tell you is that the purpose of the visit of the high commissioner for human rights is to promote exchanges and cooperation between the two sides,' he said. 'We have always opposed the use of this matter for political manipulation.' OHRC has been criticised for not yet releasing a long-delayed report on the rights situation in Xinjiang, amid reports earlier this year that Beijing had insisted it not be published before the Winter Olympic Games in February. Under the rule of President Xi Jinping, Chinese authorities in the far western region have since 2017 run a campaign of mass detention, re-education, and religious and cultural oppression of Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims. They have also been accused of conducting forced labour programmes and forced sterilisation of women. Rights groups and foreign governments have labelled the policies as crimes against humanity or genocide. China's Communist party government rejects all accusations of mistreatment and wrongdoing, and says the policies are part of anti-terror and anti-poverty campaigns. It initially denied the existence of the detention centres, where at least one million people have been detained. Later it claimed they were vocational training centres. Authorities strictly control the region, including attempting to block media access and refusing requests for international bodies like the UN to visit. Beijing has stepped up its crackdown on civil society since Xi took power in 2012, tightening restrictions on freedom of speech and detaining hundreds of activists and lawyers. On Tuesday, the UN working group on arbitrary detention ruled China was 'arbitrarily detaining' the anti-corruption activist Zhang Baocheng. Zhang was accused of 'promoting terrorism' but the working group said it had seen no information that would reasonably implicate Zhang in specific violent or criminal acts. It said the prosecution's main evidence against him during the trial had been his tweets criticising the camps in Xinjiang. The working group - made up of five independent experts who do not speak on behalf of the UN and whose opinions are not binding - called on China to 'release Mr Zhang immediately'. It demanded that Beijing provide him compensation and ensure a 'full and independent investigation of the circumstances surrounding the arbitrary deprivation of liberty'. The working group pointed out that in its 30-year-history, it had found China to be in violation of its international rights obligations in more than 1,000 cases, voicing concern that this 'indicates a systemic problem with arbitrary detention' in the country.", "0b38e34bc2ef2ba89a8767c3fb61f2eaa8a099837487f293e3d181a4": "Beijing has swiftly expanded its Covid-19 mass testing from one district this week to most of the city of nearly 22 million, adding to expectations of an imminent lockdown similar to Shanghai's. The Chinese capital began testing the residents of its most populous district, Chaoyang, on Monday. By the end of the day, even though only a fraction of the results had come out, the city decided to conduct tests on 10 other districts and one economic development zone by Saturday. The Chinese capital reported 33 new locally transmitted cases for 25 April, the city's health authority said on Tuesday, of which 32 were symptomatic and one was asymptomatic. That was slightly higher than 19 community infections reported a day earlier. Beijing's decision to test roughly 20 million people came a few days after tens of infections were found. In contrast, Shanghai waited for about a month and more than 1,000 cases before launching a city-wide mass testing drive in early April. 'To resolutely curb the risk of the spread of the epidemic and effectively maintain the health of the citizens, it was decided to further expand the scope of regional screening on the basis of the tests done in Chaoyang district,' a spokesman of Beijing's municipal government said on Monday night. Three rounds of PCR tests will be conducted from Tuesday to Saturday in the districts Dongcheng, Xicheng, Haidian, Fengtai, Shijingshan, Fangshan, Tongzhou, Shunyi, Changping, Daxing, as well as the Beijing Economic-Technological Development Area. Beijing's latest Covid outbreak, while modest by global standards, is expected to deepen fears of a Shanghai-style lockdown of the Chinese capital, further clouding the country's economic outlook as endless mass testing, a rigorous quarantine regime and tight social distancing rules take their toll. Asian markets suffered their worst day in over a month on Monday on fears that Beijing was about to enter such a lockdown.

The rules have been called 'discriminatory' and 'ableist' by advocates calling for reform. Arianna Alfonzo, 12, has had to remain in the Philippines for the past six years while her father, Allan, works in Christchurch where he has a carpet-laying business. Both he and Arianna's mother, Gail Alfonzo, have residency status in New Zealand. But Arianna's applications to come to New Zealand have been denied. The case, first reported by the New Zealand Herald, is one of hundreds rejected under New Zealand's rules, which set a $41,000 limit over five years on an immigrant's cost to the health system. The criteria exclude people with a number of 'high-cost' conditions including physical disability, intellectual disability, autistic spectrum disorders, brain injury, multiple sclerosis and cancers. Arianna's mother, Gail Alfonzo, said the family had spent thousands on specialists and lawyers to try to prove their family unit would not be a burden on New Zealand. She wrote in a public plea for support that her husband 'is a hardworking person and trustworthy, he is a good citizen and abides by New Zealand law. We are in our early 40s and we are very sure both of us will contribute [to] the growth and economy of New Zealand.' 'Like any other child, Arianna deserves to live with dignity and be treated fairly,' she said. 'Arianna deserves to have a complete and happy family.' The New Zealand Green party MP Ricardo Menendez March, who has advocated for the Alfonzo family, called the system 'a deeply dehumanising process which strips them of their human rights and makes them plead in the media and to MPs to simply be seen as the whole human beings that we all are'. March said he was aware of about 400 residency visas that had been declined on the basis of people not meeting the health conditions. 'In my view, New Zealand is far behind some comparable jurisdictions,' he said. March said he had written to the associate immigration minister Phil Twyford asking him to reassess the Alfonzo case. That request was denied. A spokesperson for Twyford's office said he was not able to comment on individual cases. The Alfonzo family is not the first high-profile case of prospective immigrants being rejected for their disability. Juliana Carvalho was initially rejected on similar grounds - she has lupus and is paraplegic. Carvalho spent seven years challenging the decision, and said it took an enormous toll. 'Honestly the emotional toll was worse than becoming paraplegic, in terms of mental health and suffering ... This whole messaging that all you are [is] a burden, that you add no value - it has a huge impact on someone's life,' she said. After beginning her time in New Zealand under a student visa, it took six years before Carvahlo was approved for residency. 'I am a very resourceful person with amazing friends, family, I have the support, and for me it was almost unbearable,' Carvalho said. 'Now imagine for a child with a disability, who is building their identity - what is the impact of this messaging for children? And what is the impact of this messaging for all the other children with disabilities in this country?' In 2021, Carvalho presented a 35,000-person petition to have the rules changed. This March, however, the government said it would not review the current criteria. 'The current settings are not specifically discriminatory against disabled people, but instead focus on assessing the public health impact an individual will have,' said a government statement. 'The government values the contribution that disabled people bring to society and is always willing to take steps towards making New Zealand a non-disabling society. However, as this goal pertains to the current Acceptable Standard of Health (ASH) immigration settings, the government considers these settings appropriate.'", "156645ebf5f319504891331d4995000a6e207928d89130499b10922b": "Free media in Hong Kong has been almost completely dismantled by the government crackdown, clearing the market for an expanded pro-Beijing and state-owned media sector, a new report has said. The report, by UK-based advocacy group Hong Kong Watch, came shortly after Hong Kong's Foreign Correspondent's Club announced it was suspending its Human Rights Press Awards because it did not want to unintentionally violate the city's wide-ranging national security law imposed in 2020 by Beijing. The working environment for local and foreign journalists in Hong Kong has become increasingly difficult, the report said, detailing the widespread use of 'lawfare' against journalists - including with the national security law - acts of intimidation and police violence, mass sackings, and government intervention or censorship of outlets. It noted the redefinition by police of who constituted a journalist, the pending introduction of a fake news law, and the criminalising of traditional research methods. Since the 2019 pro-democracy protests, a crackdown has seen the closure of Apple Daily, Stand News and others. Sources and citizens now fear retribution or legal consequences for speaking to journalists. A government intervention into RTHK has stripped the public broadcaster of its former editorial independence, and a chilling effect has spread across remaining media, with some engaging in alarming self-censorship. In one example, Chris Wong - a former news presenter with the TVB broadcaster - described to Hong Kong Watch his attempts to report on the November 2019 attack on pro-democracy councillor Andrew Chiu, whose ear was bitten off. The attack was evidenced by clear photographs and video, the report noted. 'The script that the editor provided said that Mr Chiu's ear fell off naturally, somehow,' Wong said. 'Nobody did anything, it was not a bite, and the ear just fell to the floor. The editors did not want to cover violence by pro-Beijing 'blue' supporters.' Wong also said they were ordered to call protesters 'black shirts' and to not cover their press conferences, while running those by the police in full. 'Unfortunately, TVB damaged the reputation of its journalists, and because of TVB's reputation, all former employees are living and working under a lot of public criticism.' The report also detailed multiple acts of police violence against journalists during the protests, including some which appeared targeted. 'We were sitting on the ground, and we had taken off our gear, our masks and helmets and other protective gear,' a South China Morning Post photojournalist said of covering one protest. 'The police came and sprayed teargas directly at us. The hatred that the police showed against the media was shocking.' The silencing and intimidation of Hong Kong's media scene had been helped by pro-Beijing outlets which now benefited from the reduced industry, the report suggested. 'In the absence of pro-democracy media, it is worth pausing here to consider the implications of the erosion of press freedom and how it creates further space for the pro-Beijing media,' the report said, accusing the outlets of 'providing propaganda for the Chinese Communist party regime and the Hong Kong government, and threatening their critics, both in print and through various forms of harassment.' 'I think we have seen an emboldening of them,' said Hong Kong Watch director, Benedict Rogers, noting recent moves by Ta Kung Pao to devote entire pages to attacking the church, church-run schools, Hong Kong Cardinal Joseph Zen, and Hong Kong Watch. 'That struck me as a kind of escalation and emboldening. They've always from time to time gone after people like me and people in Hong Kong but I've never seen full page spreads.' The report also noted the claims of former Stand News editor and chair of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, Ronson Chan, that he was tailed by a Ta Kung Pao reporter before the paper published a front page story accusing him of visiting a sex worker. In March 2020 Ta Kung Pao published a list of artists and arts organisations it said were linked to anti-government activists, including the artist Kacey Wong who later fled to Taiwan. The report also accused the papers of publishing 'propaganda' including descriptions of the 2021 vote for the legislative council, as 'the most successful since handover' despite a historically low voter turnout of about 30%. The general public for now can still get news from remaining free media and international outlets, Rogers said, 'but in terms of Chinese language local media they really have a much much narrower choice and the danger then is they're getting info filtered through the lens of Beijing's propaganda.' In the report Hong Kong Watch called for international governments to offer pathways and assistance to fleeing Hong Kong journalists who want to emigrate, and to continue Cantonese language media from overseas. It also called for governments to use Magnitsky-style sanctions and other forms of pressure to encourage the Hong Kong government to restore media freedoms. 'The international community must not allow those responsible for these violations to get away with impunity and without consequence,' it said.", "0b52232592b1fb554e6fcbd215a05d740054ab1ac03e186f9b58e7ca": "Six Indonesian children wrongly jailed in Australia as adult people smugglers have cleared their names in a case exposing a grave and 'substantial miscarriage of justice'. The six Indonesians, aged between 13 and 17 at the time of their arrest, were intercepted on fishing boats in Australian waters in 2009, during the highly charged political climate around border protection. The children had been lured on to the boats from their impoverished villages with vague offers of highly paid work, often unaware of their destination or that they were to transport asylum seekers. Internal records seen by the Guardian show the children repeatedly told immigration officials and police they were children, which ordinarily would have meant they were sent home under Australian Federal Police policy. Instead, police relied on the use of X-rays to interpret the maturity of their wrists, comparing them to a reference tool built using the bones of healthy, middle-class Americans. The X-rays were used to conclude that the boys were likely to be adults, and police charged them as such. All but one of the boys pleaded guilty. That technique has since been completely discredited. On Tuesday, the WA court of appeal overturned the convictions of Rudi Usman, Hamzah Gogo, Muhammad Maleng, Maikel Husa, Usman Ari and Vandi, who were represented by Ken Cush & Associates. The court found 'a substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred'. The court found that, without the wrist X-ray evidence, all six boys would 'not have been charged as an adult' and the WA district court would have had no jurisdiction to deal with their cases. 'The cogency of the remaining available evidence, as to the date of birth of each appellant, cannot support a finding that, at the material time, any of the appellants was of or over the age of 18 years,' it found. The court said commonwealth prosecutors had now conceded their earlier reliance on the wrist X-ray evidence 'gives rise to a serious doubt about the integrity of each plea of guilty and about the integrity of each decision not to put in issue the appellant's age'. 'The Crown has conceded that a miscarriage of justice was occasioned by each of the convictions; the judgments of conviction should be set aside; and judgments of acquittal should be entered,' the court said. 'The Crown accepts that there was no reliable evidence when each appellant was convicted and sentenced that he was of or over the age of 18 years.' Documents attached to the boys' case reveal both police and senior government figures knew before the boys were jailed that there were doubts about its accuracy. Documents seen by the Guardian show an investigating officer in some of the cases had been involved in a remarkably similar prosecution eight years earlier, during which the court heard that using wrist X-ray evidence to determine age was open to error and 'not an exact science', and that the key reference tool on which it depended should be used with 'judicious scepticism'. Despite those concerns, police altered the dates of birth provided to them by the six children - changing the year of birth, but keeping the month and date - to turn them into adults and make their ages fit the X-ray reports. The new dates, which the boys' lawyers told the court were 'fictitious', were used in prosecution notices, indictments and other sworn legal documents to prosecute the children as adults. An internal immigration department briefing from June 2010 shows the government was directly warned about the reliability of the technique. That briefing occurred well before five of the six children were convicted and sentenced, but after the X-ray reports were produced. The briefing warned the government that wrist X-rays were prone to error and pointed to UK guidelines warning against using them to determine age, which said: 'The issue of whether chronological age can be determined from the estimate of bone age has been discussed at great length in the literature. The answer is that it cannot.' After about three years and multiple complaints about the detention of children in adult jails, they were released on licence and sent home. Many were not told they were being released due to doubts about the evidence. They remained convicted people smugglers who were still technically serving their sentence. In 2012, the Australian Human Rights Commission investigated the detention of children on people-smuggling charges and delivered a scathing report, titled An Age of Uncertainty, which said Australia's treatment of such children was 'disturbing' and that 'Australian authorities apparently gave little weight to the rights of this cohort of young Indonesians'. The then human rights commissioner Catherine Branson told the Guardian she thought at the time the government agencies responsible for investigating and prosecuting smuggling felt they were under political pressure. 'I concluded that these agencies wanted to be seen to be bringing prosecutions and securing significant penalties,'' she said. 'They wanted to be seen to be taking people-smuggling seriously. 'They wanted to find some way to determine age; there was a high level of anxiety to find a biological marker that could tell you precisely how old a person was, but, in the end, their reliance on the wrist X-rays proved to be ill-founded.' At the time, Branson, now chancellor of the University of Adelaide, considered it likely that many of the young people crewing people-smuggling boats were 'in a sense, victims themselves'. 'They were mainly from remote Indonesian islands, from impoverished backgrounds,' she said. 'If someone approached these young people, offering what was to them an enormous amount of money, and all they have to do is come sailing for a few days, of course they would accept. 'Many of them appeared to have had no idea what they were part of; they were already out at sea when they learned that passengers were on board, they couldn't get back, there was then nothing they could do. The ringleaders in all of this were, by the time the vessels reached Australian waters, far away. 'It seemed pretty clear to me many of these young people were victims too.' Andreas Schloenhardt, a professor of criminal law at the University of Queensland, has written extensively on the criminalisation of people smuggling by Australia and the mandatory minimum penalties that severely limited sentencing discretion. He argues that they forced judges to impose harsh sentences they considered to be disproportionate to the culpability of offenders, a fact acknowledged by some judges themselves. The prosecution of alleged people smugglers was influenced by a 'great deal of misleading political and media rhetoric ... myths and stereotypes about people smuggling and people smugglers', he wrote in the Sydney Law Review in 2016. Schloenhardt told the Guardian a confluence of pressures was brought to bear on different government agencies as the number of boats grew: from seven arrivals in 2008 to 300 by 2013. The AFP had been given laws that made 'facilitating the entry of five or more people' into Australia 'a very simple, easy-to-prove offence' to be laid against captains and crew of asylum boats. The commonwealth director of public prosecutions was 'completely overwhelmed by the caseload' generated by the growing number of boats. 'But the most significant flaw is in the design of this legislation,'' Schloenhardt said. 'Australian law has been consistently criticised because it does not reflect international law. To this day, our thresholds for prosecution are much lower, and we capture people that under international law do not commit any offence. 'This is a political decision, of course. The people who wrote these laws in the 1990s, who rewrote them in 2010, they knew what they were doing.' Schloenhardt said mandatory minimum sentences were introduced for people-smuggling offences despite widespread criticism. Tony Kevin, a former Australian ambassador who has spent decades researching the issue of asylum seeker boats, said Australian policies had made asylum voyages more dangerous. 'Australian policy, by criminalising the Indonesian ferrymen and the sailors who worked for them, has had all sorts of perversely negative consequences. Those policies encouraged people smugglers to seek out old, dilapidated boats of little value - because they knew the boats would be burned - and that made voyages more lethal.' Kevin said severe penalties for adults, but not for children, meant there was an incentive to recruit minors to be crew. 'These poor young boys - they didn't know what was happening, they didn't carry documents - and great mistakes were made I'm sure, which left them rotting in Australian prisons. 'But these children were expendable to the nasty people organising these trips, whom we rarely, if ever, saw before Australian courts.' The AFP said in a statement that it no longer used wrist X-rays for age determination. It said it could not comment on matters before the courts.", "ea19138365659e869597117fe90e9a3680f14b33db1539f3892abd6b": "The price of edible oils such as soyoil, sunflower oil and rapeseed oil is expected to rise after Indonesia announced a surprise export palm oil ban, experts have warned. Major edible oils are already in short supply due to adverse weather and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The move by Indonesia to pause exports will place extra strain on cost-sensitive consumers in Asia and Africa hit by higher fuel and food prices. 'Indonesia's decision affects not only palm oil availability, but vegetable oils worldwide,' James Fry, chairman of commodities consultancy LMC International, told Reuters. Palm oil - used in everything from cakes and frying fats to cosmetics and cleaning products - accounts for nearly 60% of global vegetable oil shipments, and top producer Indonesia accounts for around a third of all vegetable oil exports. It announced the export ban on 22 April, until further notice, in a move to tackle rising domestic prices. 'This is happening when the export tonnages of all other major oils are under pressure: soya bean oil due to droughts in South America; rapeseed oil due to disastrous canola crops in Canada; and sunflower oil because of Russia's war on Ukraine,' Fry said. Rasheed JanMohd, chairman of Pakistan Edible Oil Refiners Association (PEORA) said: 'Nobody can compensate for the loss of Indonesian palm oil. Every country is going to suffer.' Vegetable oil prices have already risen more than 50% in the past six months as factors from labour shortages in Malaysia to droughts in Argentina and Canada - the biggest exporters of soyoil and canola oil respectively - curtailed supplies. Buyers were hoping a bumper sunflower crop from top exporter Ukraine would ease the tightness, but supplies from Kyiv have stopped as a result of Russia's invasion. This had prompted importers to bank on palm oil being able to plug the supply gap until Indonesia's shock ban delivered a 'double whammy' to buyers, said Atul Chaturvedi, president of trade body the Solvent Extractors Association of India (SEA). Importers such as India, Bangladesh and Pakistan will try to increase palm oil purchases from Malaysia, but the world's second-biggest palm oil producer cannot fill the gap created by Indonesia, Chaturvedi said. Malaysia accounts for 31% of global palm oil supply, second after Indonesia's 56%. Indonesia typically supplies nearly half of India's total palm oil imports, while Pakistan and Bangladesh import nearly 80% of their palm oil from Indonesia. In February, prices of vegetable oils jumped to a record high as sunflower oil supplies were disrupted from the Black Sea region. A state-backed Malaysian palm oil group said countries should pause or slow use of edible oil as biofuel to ensure adequate supply for use in food, warning of a supply crisis following Indonesia's ban on palm oil exports. Palm oil is also used as biodiesel feedstock. Indonesia and Malaysia make it mandatory for biodiesel to be mixed with a certain amount of palm oil - 30% and 20% respectively - and just last month said they remain committed to those mandates, despite higher palm prices.

The people's convoy, inspired by Canadian truckers who shut down roads to protest vaccine mandates, arrived in the Bay Area last week after weeks of demonstrations in Washington DC. On Friday, about 20 drivers filled the road near the home of Buffy Wicks, a Democratic assemblymember, honking, and using bullhorns to demand she leave her home. The group was reportedly protesting legislation Wicks wrote that would end coroner investigations of stillbirths, the San Francisco Chronicle reported, and require state businesses to mandate Covid vaccines for their employees. The convoy, however, drew fierce opposition from neighbors, who told the drivers to leave the residential street, SF Gate reported. Wicks called law enforcement for protection, and the trucks dispersed when police responded to the scene. When the convoy got stuck in traffic outside an Oakland Safeway, however, a group of residents began throwing eggs at the stalled vehicles, shouting 'get the fuck out of here', according to video of the incident. Passersby partook as well, grabbing eggs and tossing them at trucks scrawled with phrases such as 'Let's go Brandon', a coded term among Trump supporters to insult Joe Biden, as they drove by. Many of those throwing eggs at the group were kids who cheered each other on and then fled after running out of eggs. Some jumped out of their vehicles and engaged in heated confrontations with those throwing eggs. 'We're fighting for your freedoms too,' a protester yelled at the kids, the SF Gate reported. The group fled back to their base in Sacramento, complaining about their icy reception and dirty vehicles. 'Bullhorns and loud trucks lend no legitimacy to baseless conspiracy theories from out of state protesters,' Erin Ivie, a spokesperson for Wicks' office, told the Mercury News.

It is considerable larger than the rest of Amazon's Echo Show devices, which were recently given a motorised screen and small desk-ready displays. The Echo Show 15 - which costs PS239.99 ($249.99/A$399) - dwarfs them, with its huge 15.6in screen looking more like a picture frame than a piece of technology. That illusion is furthered by its wall-mountable form - it is designed to be hung in a central place like the digital equivalent of the pinboards common to kitchens of homes of the 1980s, and can be mounted in landscape or portrait orientation. It can be bought with a stand for PS30 more if you would rather not screw 2.2kg of technology into your wall. The 1080p touchscreen is bright and crisp when viewed at arm's reach. Its two 1.6in speakers are loud and clear for Alexa's voice or watching video but only average for music lacking in bass, sounding closer to the budget Echo Dot than the beefier Echo Show 10. It has buttons on the top for volume, muting the microphones and camera, plus a physical privacy shutter for the camera. For the most part it works just like Amazon's other Alexa smart displays. It answers questions, sets timers, controls smart home devices and shows feeds from Ring doorbells or other compatible cameras. It can also display your photos from Amazon Photos or Facebook, either alongside other content or on their own like a huge digital photo frame, which looks great. Unlike its siblings, the Show 15 can display more than one thing at once, supporting multiple widgets on its home screen alongside the usual time, information and photo display. Widgets can include a yellow sticky note for leaving messages, shared to-do lists, calendars, the weather, Amazon Music controls, recipe ideas and smart home controls. The concept is great but the widgets are a little sluggish in use and lack variety in their size, shape and placement. There needs to be more of them, and I'd like a larger smart home control widget and to be able to put the largest calendar widget at the bottom of the screen, not in the middle. It is a good start but they have some way to go to be a killer feature. Video feeds from security cameras can stream in a floating picture-in-picture window so that you can see who is at the door while doing something else, such as following a recipe, which is handy. The big screen lends itself to being a kitchen TV but only Amazon Prime Video and Netflix have native apps that you can access via voice, such as asking for the latest Bond movie. For everything else you have to use the built-in Silk browser to view them like you would on a laptop. It is a clunky affair but YouTube, BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub and All4 work well enough with voice control of play and pause once you have the right video loaded. Some, such as BT Sport, don't respond to voice controls, while Disney+ will not work in the browser at all. You can play music from Amazon Music, Apple Music, Deezer or Spotify as well as BBC Sounds and various other radio stations through TuneIn. The Show 15 can also be used as a Bluetooth speaker from your phone or tablet or connected to a third-party speaker. The 5-megapixel camera can recognise the face of the person standing in front of it using Amazon's new 'Visual ID', which then shows personalised content such as a specific calendar, music account and so on without you having to directly interact with the display or Alexa. It works well, greeting you with the name and a little picture of the person it has recognised, so you can see whose account the information is coming from. The camera can be used for video calls to other Echo Show devices, contacts with the Alexa app or through Skype. It works well enough but can be a bit sluggish to start a call and you can't currently use Zoom or any other service in the UK yet. You can use it like a security camera, too, viewing its live feed through the Alexa app on your phone. The Echo Show 15 is generally repairable and will receive security updates for at least four years after the device is discontinued. It contains 99% recycled aluminium plus at least 35% recycled plastic. Amazon has also pledged to offset the electricity used by Echo devices with renewable energy. The company offers trade-in and recycling schemes. The Amazon Echo Show 15 costs PS239.99 ($249.99/A$399) or PS269.98 ($279.98/A$448.95) with a stand. The stand can be bought separately for PS29.99. For comparison, the Echo Show 5 costs PS44.99, the Echo Show 8 costs PS119.99 and Echo Show 10 costs PS239.99, while Google's Nest Hub Max costs PS219 and the Nest Hub costs PS89.99. The Echo Show 15 is a good smart display with a lot of potential to be a really great one. There is nothing else quite like it on the market, with that big 15.6in screen, picture-frame surround and wall-mounting or stand options. But Amazon has yet to really take advantage of its size, with only a few limited widget and multitasking options. It feels as if it could do so much more as the central digital hub of a home. Alexa responds quickly and does everything it can on Amazon's smaller displays. The face recognition works well as a way of showing you personalised content without having to directly interact with it. If you want a really big Alexa smart display for the kitchen, the Echo Show 15 is it, priced the same as Amazon's smaller 10in motorised version. But it isn't quite the revolution it promises just yet.", "b352bd83b8448ec80027b72448e6e90a8d1af31633b6b9c652f36d26": "", "5498ea0d530b89434854974d6b3eb9a4fccd309dd5aadf1f28536eeb": "", "17e815aa14fb852e11f33a76884dcf051df0e03904dcc4d5f844cfd5": "", "527db8d04a0fd0ecdcd80bff29a9f0681f745b1be160227af1a4717a": "For a visitor to this rural part of eastern Nebraska, the crisp air, blue skies and stretch of seemingly endless farm fields appear as unspoiled landscape. But for the people who live here, there is no denying this is an environmental disaster that researchers fear may affect generations to come. It has been just over a year since state regulators stepped in to close down the AltEn LLC ethanol plant on the outskirts of Mead, Nebraska, a small village of about 500 people near Omaha. The plant was found to be the source of huge quantities of toxic, pesticide-laced waste, which was stored in lagoons and piled into hills of a putrid lime-green mash. That waste then was accidentally spilled and intentionally spread throughout the area, including on to farm fields and into waterways that provide drinking water for people and wildlife several miles downstream. A monumental cleanup is under way that could cost perhaps $100m or more, according to Bill Thorson, the village board chairman. 'The stench would be so bad your eyes would burn here in town,' Thorson said in a recent interview. 'Let's get this cleaned up.' Signs of the impact on this community are everywhere. A farmhouse has been abandoned by its owners after their young children experienced health problems; a pond once filled with fish and frogs is now empty of all life; university researchers are collecting blood and urine from residents to analyze them for contaminants. A family miles away from the plant said they now only drink water from plastic bottles because tests show chemical contamination of their drinking well. 'We want it back to what it was,' resident Stan Keiser told the Guardian. 'That shouldn't be too much to ask.' Crews of environmental engineers are filtering millions of gallons of water through newly constructed treatment units and adopting techniques seen at some US Superfund sites to contain and control the waste. The measures include the use of a helicopter to drop a temporary, protective shell-like coating of cement, fiber and clay over 16 acres of waste piles. Questions about how best to move forward have divided this community of about 500 people. Some are calling for the federal Environmental Protection Agency to declare a Superfund site in Mead, while others say such a move would only add to costs and bureaucracy and depress property values. State regulators plan to hold a public hearing in the Mead high school gymnasium on 27 April as part of an effort to listen to concerns. Regulators are also providing 'information and updates' to the community on a designated webpage on the cleanup. The regulators say they are inspecting the site three times a week to try to prevent further escape of toxins. Researchers, however, say it is not clear if or how all the damage can be erased, and the situation underscores how difficult - perhaps impossible - it is to truly escape contamination from pesticides and other chemicals that are becoming pervasive in our environment, and answer questions about the health impacts. 'We are using and releasing more chemicals into the environment than ever before, and know very little about long-term effects from exposure,' said Daniel Snow, an environmental chemist and director of the water sciences laboratory at the University of Nebraska. The trouble at AltEn traces back to a strategy that defied normal industry practices. AltEn advised large seed companies that they could rid themselves of unwanted stocks of corn seed and other types of seeds coated with highly concentrated amounts of fungicides and insecticides by 'recycling' them for use in AltEn's production of biofuel. These treated seeds are widely used by farmers to try to protect crops from insects and disease but are seen by environmental advocates as detrimental and unnecessary. The seed coatings on the products disposed of at AltEn contained concentrated amounts of several pesticides that are known as neonicotinoids, or 'neonics', which can have neurotoxic effects on people and animals. Neonicotinoids are used across on an estimated 150m acres of US farmland, and scientific research has shown they are contributing to a decline in important pollinators such as honeybees. While some countries have banned certain neonics, the US government has proposed allowing extended use. So while the strategy gave AltEn supplies for its ethanol, it also left the plant with toxic wastewater and more than 80,000 tons of a pesticide-laden solid byproduct or 'wet cake', mounded in piles around the plant property. State officials recorded the neonic pesticides in AltEn waste at levels many times higher than what is considered safe. For the neonic known as clothianidin the regulatory benchmark is 11 parts per billion, but AltEn waste contained clothianidin at 427,000 parts per billion, for instance, according to state records. Regulatory documents show that plant operators spread some of the waste materials on area farm fields and more flowed off the AltEn property through a series of events that included heavy rains and a ruptured pipe. Regulators finally closed down the plant in early 2021. AltEn's former operators, who are also now being sued by the Nebraska attorney general for multiple alleged environmental violations, could not be reached for comment. Lawyers for AltEn also did not respond to a request for comment. Six of the world's largest seed companies have filed lawsuits against AltEn, alleging plant operators violated contracts and failed to dispose of the chemically treated seeds safely. The companies, which include the Monsanto owner Bayer AG and Chinese-owned Syngenta, are paying for and organizing the cleanup effort through a coalition they call the AltEn Facility Response Group (AFRG). In its lawsuit against AltEn, Syngenta alleges that plant operators left the property with 'significant environmental risks' that included 'thousands of tons of untreated wet cake on the property in improperly managed and inadequately secured piles' and 'lagoons overfilled with wastewater and in risk of failing'. Along with covering the toxin-filled wet cake with the temporary shell, contractors hired by AFRG have constructed a new lined pond system on the AltEn site, treated 14m gallons of wastewater, and have started disposing of the treated water by applying it to area fields, among other measures. They are not yet sure how to dispose of the wet cake, but are analyzing options, according to Don Gunster, a project coordinator with NewFields environmental consulting firm, which is working for the AFRG alongside other engineering and scientific firms specializing in environmental cleanups. 'Our efforts are starting to make an important difference at the site,' Gunster said. A top priority is 'ensuring the safety of the surrounding community and environment while addressing the site conditions caused by AltEn', he said. Ray and Emily Loftus abandoned their dream home, only half a mile away from AltEn, after their youngest child started having respiratory problems and they determined the old farmhouse with the big yard was too close to the plant to be safe for their family of four. The property now sits vacant, a child's ball still resting in the grass near a swing set moved now only by the breeze. A few miles downstream from AltEn, Stan Keiser and his wife drink only bottled water after AltEn contaminants were found in their well, and they are both saddened and infuriated by the flow of toxic wastewater that they say has wiped all signs of life from the four-acre farm pond. Testing of the pond water, sediment and private well all showed evidence of pesticide contamination. Their daughter Amy Whitehead can't forget the sight of the dead beavers and a small dead fox she found near the water after a burst pipe at AltEn sent foul-smelling foamy wastewater flowing on to the Keiser property. The fish died long before that, just about a year after AltEn started using the pesticide-coated seeds. The farm has been in her family since 1911, and she hopes her children can one day live and play on the land without risk. But she worries that may not be possible any time soon. 'I worry about the water,' Whitehead said. 'It's not clean. It just seems dead.' Keiser used to enjoy fishing with his wife and running grandkids around the pond in a paddleboat, but now the couple has dismantled the dock and they keep their distance from the water. In a letter sent to state regulators in February, the Keisers said concerns over the condition of their drinking water persist. They want routine testing of their well water, and a filtration system put in place for their home and livestock water needs. They also want their pond water removed and treated, the sediment removed, and a new liner installed. 'We just want to make these people accountable,' Stan Keiser said of AltEn. 'They knew what they were doing.' Even as the experts race to detoxify the AltEn wastewater storage lagoons, researchers say contaminated water has already moved far from Mead, potentially even into the aquifer that supplies water for cities and towns throughout the region. More could be leaching into the environment under the unlined piles of wet cake, they fear. Airborne transmission is also a possible culprit as some of the waste was incinerated by AltEn operators before the shutdown. Researchers from the University of Nebraska Medical School are launching a study to try to assess if there are any long-term health impacts from the contamination. They will soon start collecting blood and urine from people in the area looking for pesticide contamination, and they have set up an online human health survey to gather more information. Researchers with the University of Nebraska and Creighton University are also testing animals and taking samples of water, soil and air. To truly understand the impacts on human and environmental health will take several years and up to $8m, they say. 'We think that some of the human health consequences of this are not going to show up in a few days, they are going to show up maybe in a few years,' said Eleanor Rogan, interim chair of the department of health promotion, College of Public Health at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Rogan and other researchers said they had run into multiple roadblocks, including opposition from the agricultural industry and many state lawmakers. The research, which underscores the hazards that come with the chemically treated seeds, is being deemed as 'anti-business', according to University of Nebraska research scientist Judy Wu-Smart. The legislature rejected a $10m funding proposal for the university research into AltEn impacts, approving instead $1m. If other funds are not found, the work will have to be curtailed, according to Rogan. Carol Blood, a Democrat in the Nebraska legislature, is one lawmaker who supports the research and wants an investigation into the regulatory handling of AltEn. Blood is now running for governor, promising to put an end to 'secrecy' surrounding AltEn issues. 'We want to make sure it doesn't happen again,' said Blood. 'We don't know if someone in grade school now may not be able to have children when they grow up because of this. People may get cancer, people may get sick. We don't want people to think that Mead is a bad place to live and raise a family. But it's about having clean air to breathe and clean water to drink.'", "624698df24f5ecba6e734bead0178e4ef65bd9ad7343e8f514d693c5": "Mornings are the worst time for Fayness Alpha. Her children wail from hunger most often when they wake up, she says. Alpha was 15 when she first arrived at Dzaleka - a refugee camp in Dowa, 40km from Malawi's capital Lilongwe - having been forced from her home in the Democratic Republic of the Congo by bandit attacks. A decade later, she is married with three children. But, like thousands of others, she is unable to find work in the camp or to leave, rendering her dependent on rations provided by the UN's World Food Programme (WFP). But the WFP - underfunded and facing pressure from other emergencies - 're-evaluated' the needs of the camp's inhabitants. Alpha was among hundreds who found themselves removed from the list for receiving monthly food supplies. Many say this has left them destitute. 'My husband and I are jobless and depend on rations to survive. Ever since we were taken off the list, life has been very hard and we're just surviving on the grace of God,' says Alpha. 'Life is complicated now, and as you can see my children are crying because of hunger. We're living a difficult and painful life.' She has appealed to WFP staff to reconsider her situation. The UN conducted a household 'vulnerability profiling exercise' of 10,846 refugee and asylum-seeker households in Dzaleka in 2020. Ranking households by income and need, it determined that 678 had found alternative livelihoods, making them food secure. But many of those who found themselves removed say they are baffled as to why. Dzaleka was established 25 years ago in response to an increase in the number of people fleeing genocide and wars in Burundi, Rwanda and DRC. With an initial capacity for 10,000 people, the camp now houses about 50,000. Malawi is again seeing new arrivals of people pushed by conflicts, civil unrest and political and economic instability across the region. About 600 people came after being displaced by Mozambique's floods in February. Paul Turnbull, WFP director for Malawi, says the growing number of people in the camp is stretching resources. 'In the current economic context, especially with the conflict in Ukraine, funding is very difficult. 'WFP appreciates the support it gets from its funding partners to provide food assistance to refugees in Malawi and elsewhere. The number of refugees in Dzaleka camp has more than doubled since 2013. With limited access to business opportunities, WFP assistance is the primary source of food for most people. Alternative sources of livelihoods in the camp have also been affected by the pandemic,' he says. More than half of those removed from the list have appealed to the WFP, including Elie Zagabe, 37, who escaped from war in DRC 16 years ago. He enrolled for community learning and eventually found a job helping out in a primary school. But he earns a minimum amount and believes his family's food rations have been taken away because of a mistake. 'I lost my position [on the list] because the two children are seriously sick. Last two weeks, the second-born was very sick and admitted at Dowa clinic with pneumonia. I think this is because of the cold here at the camp. I was with the child at the hospital while my wife was taking care of the other child at home. 'The people who were doing the survey didn't approach me. I found them at my neighbour's place and I told them to reach my home but they said since they had seen me we could interact right there.' He says others he knows on the same salary have stayed on the list, and his attempt to appeal against the decision has been in vain. 'I'm living in a desperate situation. We sometimes spend the night without food. My children cry of hunger and I have nowhere to turn to. We might die of hunger,' he says. Of the 325 households who appealed, WFP says 103 are eligible to be 'reprofiled' using the same vulnerability questionnaire used in 2020, although this does not guarantee being reinstated on the list.

It had about 2,000 shops and stalls, selling fresh fruit and meat alongside tailors' and tech support stores. When fire raged through the city of Hargeisa earlier this month, at least 28 people were injured and hundreds of businesses were destroyed. It was 'a massive calamity' for the city's economic centre, says Hargeisa's mayor, Abdikarim Ahmed Mooge. With much of Waheen in ruins, many of those who worked there have been left devastated. Most are women. Amina Ali, a meat seller at Waheen, says that although the flames have gone out, the damage continues: 'Today, our situation is at its worst. Waheen is at the heart of everything in Hargeisa and now it's all gone to waste. Nobody is coming to help us. We don't have anyone, we only have God.' Ali says the fire has affected her whole community - family and neighbours - and the scale of damage is difficult to measure. Ayaan Salaad Mohamed, who had a beauty services business, says smaller businesses like hers are not a priority. The federal government promised money but despite asking for assistance, Mohamed says not much is being done. 'Nobody knows how this has impacted us. We weren't rich people, but we would make enough money to get through our daily affairs. Our life has taken a drastic turn, but we will work with whatever God provides,' she says. Mohamed has seven people financially dependent on her, including her widowed mother, and says she is now trying to sell fruit to make ends meet. People haven't been able to return to the market to search for any goods that survived the flames. 'The night before the fire, we left with our baskets filled to the top. Today, we are standing around aimlessly,' says Khadra Mohamed Dahir. 'People are only thinking about those who had big businesses that burned down, but what about those of us who ran smaller businesses?' Shukri Abdi sold meat in the market. All her books of receipts and customer orders were burned, making it difficult to find her regular customers and to call in money she is owed. Like others, Abdi has moved to sell under a bridge in Hargeisa.'Before, we sat comfortably selling our goods and now we are outside in the sun, with no shade. We are sitting in between the rubbish and our feet are swollen from standing up all day.' Yurub Omar has also moved under the bridge. She used to sell bananas and now sells salt and ground coffee. Nimco Husein Abdi owned a business and sold bedding, clothes and more. Her customers paid in instalments. 'All my things are gone. I still haven't paid my rent but if me and my children are alive, we have to thank God. I'm just sat at home most of the time because there is nothing for me to sell. But today, I came out to see if I could find some food for my children from my friends.' Halima Abdirahman Nur considers herself one of the lucky ones. 'My mother and I owned a small store and we've been working since 1991,' she says. 'We started as roadside sellers before there was an official market.' She lost everything in the fire but says her business had already enabled her to buy a house and land. 'We have lost a lot but our efforts from the last 30 years will help us survive this moment. We aren't completely empty-handed.' At an event organised to raise support for the women affected by the fire, organisers asked people to put politics aside and focus on how to help rebuild lives. 'We need to help the girls and mothers of Somaliland, especially focusing on those who are small business owners. There are people who will not even be able to afford to eat after this,' Khadra Aadan, one of those affected by the fire, says.'It's not enough for us to just feel sympathy for these women, we need to act quickly now.'

In it, he said that deliveries of western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the Nato alliance is 'in essence engaged in war with Russia' and Moscow views these weapons as legitimate targets, according to Reuters. 'These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russia's military acting within the context of the special operation,' Lavrov said. 'Storage facilities in western Ukraine have been targeted more than once (by Russian forces). How can it be otherwise?' Lavrov said. 'Nato, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war.' I'm Helen Livingstone, taking over the Guardian's live coverage of the war in Ukraine from my colleague Dani Anguiano. Thank you for following today's coverage of the war in Ukraine. We will be closing this liveblog but you can catch all the latest developments on our new blog launched below. Russia is strengthening its border security and checkpoints in the Bryansk, Kursk and Belgorod regions that border Ukraine, Ukraine's general staff has said in its morning update. On Monday large fires broke out at two oil depots in the city of Bryansk, less than 100 miles from the border with Ukraine, in what was thought to be a potential act of sabotage by Kyiv. Russia was still blockading Ukrainian forces in the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, the general staff said, and was also carrying out aerial surveillance in the region of Odesa, an important port on the Black Sea coast and the main base for Ukraine's navy. It said six enemy attacks had been repelled in the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, in eastern Ukraine, and that four tanks and five artillery systems were destroyed among other equipment. Ukraine's postal service says it plans to issue a new stamp to honour the Antonov-225 Mriya (Mriya means 'dream' in Ukrainian), which was the world's largest cargo plane before it was destroyed in an attack on Hostomel airport near Kyiv just after Russia launched its invasion. The stamp was designed by 11-year-old Sofia Kravchuk, who took part in a competition before the war in which children were asked 'What is Ukraine for me?', Ukrposhta said in a post on its Telegram channel. Two weeks ago Ukrainians began queuing up to buy the postal service's latest stamp, showing a Ukrainian soldier giving the finger to the Russian Black Sea cruiser the Moskva. The stamp was inspired by Roman Hrybov, who infamously told the flagship 'Russian warship, go fuck yourself!' when its crew asked him and his fellow border guards on Snake Island, south of the port of Odesa, to surrender in the early hours of the Russian innvasion. The phrase has since gone global. The US has launched a new web portal which will allow a US-based sponsor to apply for Ukrainian refugees and their immediate family members to stay in the US for up to two years. The programme, called Uniting for Ukraine, was announced by president Joe Biden last week and foresees the arrival of up to 100,000 Ukrainians. Would-be sponsors have to fill out a form and will then be vetted by US authorities to 'protect against exploitation and abuse, and ensure that they are able to financially support the individual(s) whom they agree to support,' according to the web portal. It also warns that Ukrainians arriving in the country without a valid visa or pre-authorisation may be denied entry and told to apply through the programme. The 193 members of the UN General Assembly are to vote Tuesday on a resolution that would require the five permanent members of the Security Council to justify their use of the veto in future, AFP reports. The news agency writes:  The head of Ukraine's state rail company says that one railway worker was killed and four injured by Russian missile strikes on five Ukrainian railway stations on Monday, Reuters reports. Ukrainian forces had meanwhile repelled five Russian attacks and killed just over 200 Russian servicemen, according to the Ukrainian military command in the southern and eastern sectors. Five tanks were also destroyed, along with eight armoured vehicles, it said in a statement.  Russia has accused Kyiv of preventing civilians trapped with Ukrainian soldiers in Mariupol's Azovstal steelworks from leaving the besieged industrial centre despite a ceasefire announcement, AFP reports. The news agency writes: Ukraine's deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, had earlier said the UN should be the 'initiator and guarantor' of any agreement with Russia on evacuating civilians from the steel plant. Vereshchuk wrote on Telegram: A humanitarian corridor must be opened 'by the agreement of both sides', Vereshchuk said. She said Ukraine had 'appealed' for the UN secretary general, Antonoi Guterres, to be 'the initiator and guarantor of the humanitarian corridor from Azovstal for civilians'. Representatives of the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross should be present when any humanitarian corridor was established, she said. Officials from more than 40 countries are set to gather at Germany's Ramstein airbase on Tuesday, for US-hosted talks expected to focus on how to arm Kyiv against a Russian onslaught in eastern Ukraine. The gathering will be led by US defense secretary Lloyd Austin following his meeting with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday. US army general Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters traveling with him that a key goal of the talks was to synchronize and coordinate mounting security assistance to Kyiv that includes heavy weaponry, like howitzer artillery, as well armed drones and ammunition, according to Reuters. Driven back by Ukrainian forces from a failed assault on Kyiv in the north, Moscow has redeployed its troops into the east for a ground offensive in two provinces known as the Donbas. US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, assess that Russia will rely heavily on artillery strikes, trying to pound Ukrainian positions as Moscow moves in ground forces from multiple directions to try to envelop and wipe out a significant chunk of Ukraine's military. But the United States also estimates many Russian units are depleted, with some operating with personnel losses as high as 30% - a level considered by the US military to be too high to keep fighting, officials say. US officials cite anecdotes like Russian tanks with sole drivers and no crew and substandard equipment that is either prone to breakdowns or out of date. British assessments showed that around 15,000 Russian personnel had been killed in the conflict while 2,000 armoured vehicles including some 530 tanks had been destroyed, along with 60 helicopters and fighter jets, defence secretary Ben Wallace said on Monday. Russia has so far acknowledged only 1,351 troops killed and 3,825 wounded. A suggestion by Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov that the world is at risk of descending into a third world war only means that Moscow 'senses defeat in Ukraine,' his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba has said in a tweet. Kharkiv, in north-eastern Ukraine, is the country's second city and was among the first targets of Russian forces when they launched their invasion two months ago - it has been under constant attack since then.  On Monday four people died and nine were wounded as a result of shelling in the Kharkiv region, Oleh Synegubov, the region's governor told Ukraine's public broadcaster, according to Reuters. Here are a selection of recent images from the city: The fate of Europe and of global security is being decided in Ukraine, president Volodymyr Zelesnkiy has said in his latest nightly address, which on Monday marked the beginning of the third month of the war. Even as the war was ongoing he said, 'we are demonstrating that we will give free Ukraine more opportunities for development than Russia can give not only to the occupied part of our territory, but also to its own territory, its own state.' He added: He also said that 931 settlements had been de-occupied since the invasion.  ", "cc03309fbf500e439719efb979f7154f988be2e51b5639262c73ba47": "Russia should be 'weakened to the point where it can't do things like invade Ukraine', the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said after he and the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, visited Kyiv and pledged a further $713m to help Ukraine in its war effort. The direct comment came a few hours after the two senior US figures met Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy - and was followed by Russia making an official diplomatic complaint about American arms supplies. In a press briefing on the Polish-Ukrainian border, following a visit that had until then been conducted under a media blackout for security reasons, Austin was asked what the US would see as a successful outcome to the two-month-long war. 'We want to see Ukraine remain a sovereign country, a democratic country able to protect its sovereign territory. We want to see Russia weakened to the point where it can't do things like invade Ukraine,' the defence chief said. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, the US has supplied more than $3.7bn-worth of arms to Kyiv, from Javelin anti-tank missiles and Switchblade combat drones to 90 howitzers to help combat Russia's artillery. The western military alliance Nato has said repeatedly it does not intend to fight directly in the conflict, but Austin's comments also make clear that the US has become increasingly drawn into a proxy war - in which it has become the leading supplier of military aid. Tony Blinken, the secretary of state, added that the US had put in place a strategy of 'massive support for Ukraine, massive pressure against Russia' across Nato members. It was 'having real results' he said, adding: 'And we're seeing that when it comes to Russia's war aims, Russia is failing, Ukraine is succeeding.' Russia said on Monday morning it had sent an official diplomatic note to Washington, warning it against sending more arms to Ukraine, according to the country's ambassador to the US. 'We stressed the unacceptability of this situation when the United States of America pours weapons into Ukraine, and we demanded an end to this practice,' Anatoly Antonov said in an interview with the Rossiya 24 TV channel. Of the latest package, $322m consists of direct funding to Ukraine for its war effort, while the balance is for other Nato members to reinforce them after having supplied their own arms to Kyiv during the first phase of fighting. The US will also sell Kyiv $165m of non-American ammunition compatible with the Soviet or Russian-made equipment used predominately by Ukraine's armed forces - at a point Moscow is trying to concentrate its forces in the Donbas. The assistance is also intended to help Ukraine's armed forces transition to more advanced weapons and air defence systems, essentially Nato-capable systems,' the official said. Unlike previous assistance, it is not a donation of US military stockpiles, but rather cash that countries can use to purchase what that they might need. Blinken also said US diplomats returning to Ukraine were likely to restaff the consulate in Lviv in western Ukraine before returning to Kyiv, the capital. They previously said the diplomats would start returning this week. The US embassy in Kyiv will remain closed for the moment. A US official said Joe Biden would on Monday formally nominate Bridget Brink as US ambassador to Ukraine, a post that had remained vacant for more than two years. Brink, a career foreign service officer, has been US ambassador to Slovakia since 2019. . In other developments: Russian forces have regrouped to try to capture more territory in the south-eastern Donbas region, letting foreign leaders visit the capital and some western nations resume their diplomatic presence in the west of the country in recent weeks, but Washington has been cautious about a return amid sporadic Russian missile attacks in Lviv and the capital. Austin will next travel to Germany, where he will host counterparts from more than 20 nations and the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, at the US airbase at Ramstein to discuss Ukraine's defence needs, a Pentagon official said. Topics for discussion will include battlefield updates, additional security assistance for Ukraine and longer-term defence needs in Europe, including how to step up military production to fill gaps caused by the war in Ukraine, officials added.", "67edf770f695d095b8e46a34955769edcf4771708602a43a08202cb3": "Five railway stations in central and western Ukraine were hit by Russian airstrikes in the space of an hour on Monday, as the war ground on relentlessly in the south and east of the country. Oleksander Kamyshin, the head of Ukrainian Railways, said five train stations came under fire, causing an unspecified number of casualties, as most of Ukraine was placed under an unusually long air raid warning for two hours on Monday morning. Kamyshin said one of the attacks took place at about 8.30am in Krasne, near Lviv in western Ukraine, at what the governor of the region described as a 'traction substation' that handled power supply to other lines. He said emergency workers were at the scene. Maksym Kozytskyi, the head of the regional government in Lviv, said that during the attack Ukrainian anti-aircraft systems destroyed another missile fired at the region. Ukraine's military command said Russia was trying to bomb rail infrastructure to disrupt arms supplies from foreign countries. 'They are trying to destroy the supply routes of military-technical assistance from partner states. To do this, they focus strikes on railway junctions,' it wrote in a Facebook post. Russia's defence ministry said it had destroyed six railway facilities used to supply Ukrainian forces with foreign weapons. Meanwhile, a government building in Moldova's breakaway region of Transnistria was shelled from a hand grenade launcher on Monday, the press service of the Russian-backed unrecognised state said on its Telegram channel. According to Transnistrian officials, a building belonging to the ministry of state security was hit in the region's capital, Tiraspol, on Monday evening. There were no immediate reports of injuries. A number of images circulating on social media appeared to show smoke coming out of broken windows of the government building. It was not immediately clear who was behind the apparent attack. Last week a senior Russian commander said the goal of Russia's new offensive was to seize control of southern Ukraine and to gain access to Transnistria, which lies on the southern Ukrainian border. While military experts have said it was unlikely that Russian forces would be able to stage an offensive towards the border with Moldova at this moment, the statements nevertheless raised fears in Moldova over Russia's intentions. With Moscow's support, Transnistria fought a war against Moldova in the 1990s that left the territory with de facto independence and a garrison of about 1,500 Russian troops. If confirmed to be linked to the war, it would be the first spillover of the conflict into another European country.  The train station attacks in Ukraine were not the first of the war. On 8 April in Kramatorsk, in eastern Ukraine, two ballistic missiles exploded over the railway station building, dropping deadly cluster munitions that killed 59 people and injured hundreds more. On Sunday Russian missile strikes on an oil refinery and power plant in Kremenchuk killed one person and wounded seven, according to officials. Moscow said it had destroyed oil production facilities there. Serhiy Borzov, the governor of the Vinnytsia region in central Ukraine, said Moscow fired rockets at two towns, causing an unspecified number of deaths and injuries. Russian shelling and assaults continued on Monday along most of the front in the east, including missile and bomb attacks on a huge steelworks in Mariupol where 1,000 civilians are holed up along with about 2,000 Ukrainian fighters. Serhiy Volyna, the commander of Ukraine's 36th marine brigade forces in Mariupol, said in an interview with an opposition lawmaker posted on YouTube on Sunday that Russia was targeting the complex with air and artillery bombardments. 'We are taking casualties, the situation is critical ... we have very many wounded men, [some] are dying, it's a difficult [situation] with guns, ammunition, food, medicines ... the situation is rapidly worsening,' Volyna said, speaking from the plant. The Russian defence ministry said it was opening a humanitarian corridor at 2pm (11am GMT) on Monday for all civilians to leave the besieged plant. 'The armed forces of the Russian Federation and the formations of the Donetsk people's republic from 2pm Moscow time on 25 April 2022 unilaterally cease any hostilities, units are withdrawn to a safe distance and ensure the withdrawal of the specified category of citizens in any directions they choose,' the defence ministry said in a statement posted on its Facebook page. Ukrainian officials have accused Russia of not holding fire during previous attempts to establish humanitarian routes out of the city. The Russian defence ministry on Monday repeated its claims that 'nationalists' were holding civilians hostages as 'human shields' at the Azovstal plant. It said: 'If civilians are still at the metallurgical plant, then we demand that the Kyiv authorities immediately give the appropriate order to the commanders of nationalist formations for their release.' The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, have returned to Poland after a visit to Kyiv, the highest-level US visit to the capital since Russia invaded in February. During talks, Blinken and Austin told Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that the US would provide more than $300m (PS235m) in military financing and had approved a $165m sale of ammunition, bringing total US security assistance since the invasion to about $3.7bn. More than $400m will also be split among 15 other nations in central and eastern Europe and the Balkans. Russia told the US to stop sending arms to Ukraine, with Moscow's ambassador to Washington warning that large western deliveries of weapons were inflaming the conflict and would lead to more losses. Anatoly Antonov, Russia's ambassador to the US, said such arms deliveries were aimed at weakening Russia but that they were escalating the conflict in Ukraine while undermining efforts to reach some sort of peace agreement. 'What the Americans are doing is pouring oil on the flames,' Antonov told the Rossiya 24 TV channel. 'I see only an attempt to raise the stakes, to aggravate the situation, to see more losses.' Antonov, who has served as ambassador to Washington since 2017, said an official diplomatic note had been sent to Washington expressing Russia's concerns. No reply had been given, he said. 'We stressed the unacceptability of this situation when the United States of America pours weapons into Ukraine, and we demanded an end to this practice,' Antonov said. The interview was replayed on Russian state television throughout Monday.

But life in the city is surprisingly normal - even busy - for wartime Ukraine. As the only large city in south-east Ukraine under Ukrainian control, Zaporizhzhia has become a destination for the hundreds of thousands of people who fled Russian occupation. With 70% of the wider Zaporizhzhia region under Russian military control, there are fears, however, that Moscow's forces will attempt to take it. Ukrainian reinforcements are moving towards the city and active fighting has begun in earnest. Ukrainian soldiers told the Guardian they had recently retreated from one town in the Zaporizhzhia region. Villages and towns about an hour's drive from the city that were visited by journalists three weeks ago are no longer safe, according to the regional military administration. 'You can see for yourself people are out, going to work - the city is prepared but it won't come to that,' said Ivan Ariefiev, the press secretary of the Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, at one of a series of war-related training courses being offered to the city's teachers and journalists. Attenders, who are then expected to train the wider community, were taught how to load a gun, administer first aid and do a basic medical evaluation. Despite the proximity of Russian troops, Ariefiev said, the regional military command was confident it could keep Russian forces at bay. 'No one is being evacuated from the city itself,' said Ariefiev. 'It's only the evacuees from the south who are leaving for other places.' In the newly dug maze of trenches outside Zaporizhzhia, the Guardian heard frequent incoming shells that soldiers said were landing 3km to 5km away. The group of soldiers who dug the trenches said they hoped these lines of defence would never be used and that Ukrainian soldiers farther south would withstand the attacks. The soldiers who were not on the frontlines said they had a fraction of the medical and protective equipment they needed. For the whole platoon, they had just six tourniquets - a first aid essential that prevents blood loss. When asked if they thought the Russians would advance soon, they would only say they expected to fight. 'We just need arms from our western comrades and we'll do it. The [Russians] have too much old Soviet equipment,' the platoon commander said. 'In case you hadn't noticed, they reached Kharkiv, Kyiv, encircled Sumy and Chernihiv - four huge regions - and we kicked them out. They were considered a powerful army, but we pissed on them.' The previous day there had been a double rocket strike by Russian forces. The city has been hit infrequently compared with other eastern Ukrainian cities such as Kharkiv or towns in the Donbas. Some of the eight people wounded by the rocket attack were rushed to Zaporizhzhia military hospital, which occasionally takes civilians as well as soldiers. According to the military press secretary for the hospital, Nikita, a former IT manager who joined up days after the invasion, none of the rocket strikes hit their targets, instead been caught by anti-aircraft systems, lessening the impact. 'If they had hit as intended, we would have seen many, many more wounded,' Nikita said. The head surgeon at the hospital said they were coping with the wounded but were working 24/7. He said he had been home only twice since the war started, and had been called back in almost immediately. Despite the relative safety the city's defences offer, some of those who have arrived from Russian-occupied areas want to return home. The Guardian met one woman among a crowd of people in a car park on the outskirts of the city normally used to receive convoys from Russian-occupied territory. Iryna was part of a group of about 400 people who wanted to return to Berdyansk, a city in southern Zaporizhzhia takenby Russian forces at the beginning of March. 'We're Ukrainians, we want to be part of Ukraine, but you have to understand my mother is bedridden and almost out of insulin,' Iryna said. 'I came here last week to buy Pampers and medicine [for her] because in Berdyansk there's nothing.' But the Ukrainian authorities said they could not let the group leave Zaporizhzhia because of heavy fighting on the roads. Iryna rang her husband, Vitaly, who had stayed in Berdyansk. He said over the phone that Iryna's mother had a matter of days left to live. For six days in a row the Berdyansk residents - who have clubbed together in the hope that it will make their passage safer - have come to the car park from the temporary accommodation offered to evacuees and waited for permission to leave. The drivers of the coaches and minibuses are themselves from Berdyansk, and have helped to evacuate people from there and from neighbouring cities including Mariupol. They too are eager to leave as they plan to pick more up evacuees at the other end. 'I don't care if it's dangerous, just let us go,' Iryna said to a representative of the Ukrainian military, who was surrounded by other women, a few of whom also said they were going back to look after bedridden relatives. The military representative told the women that she could not risk letting them travel because of shelling on the roads. A family with small children from near Volnovakha, a city in the Donetsk region also under Russian occupation, said they were hitching a lift with the Berdyansk convoy and planned to find other transport from there to take them home, another 150km away. 'We've run out of money. Of course we don't want to live under occupation, but we can't sleep in a shelter any more,' said Vlad, holding his three-year-old son in his arms. He said they had been in Zaporizhzhia for a week. 'It would cost us 300 hryvnia (PS8) a night to rent a flat. That's not realistic.' He added: 'The volunteers have been just super but there's no work here. At least there we have a small allotment and we'll be with our parents.' *Some names have been changed to protect people who may travel into areas Russian occupied areas of Ukraine.", "4a63b76577581516a66483180134767f07806cf72e9be83ded24f12d": "In the long, narrow basement underneath Litsey 20, a school in Ivano-Frankivsk, western Ukraine, Serhiy Korneliyevych Hamchuk stands before a row of women and lays a Kalashnikov assault rifle down on the desk in front of him. The 10 women, aged between 18 and 51, watch attentively as Hamchuk demonstrates how to load ammunition into the gun's magazine, sliding the bullets into place one after another with his thumb. 'Dobre,' he says. 'Good. Who wants to try?' The concrete walls of Litsey 20, one of the largest schools in Ivano-Frankivsk, are normally filled with the chatter of more than 1,200 students aged between six and 18. But with in-person teaching banned across Ukraine because of the war, the school is providing a different sort of education. At the end of March, the mayor of Ivano-Frankivsk, one of the largest cities in western Ukraine, announced that shooting ranges at five schools in the city - normally used by pupils in the Ukrainian equivalent of the Combined Cadet Force - would be reopened in order to teach civilians how to use firearms. Although open to all, the courses are primarily aimed at women. 'There are other institutions where men can train, but these are special courses organised for women,' Ruslan Martsinkiv, the city's mayor, says. 'Women have to be ready to protect themselves and their families.' The first lesson was held on 31 March, the day Ukrainian forces liberated Bucha, a suburb north-west of the capital, Kyiv. In the days that followed, as reports of war crimes committed by Russian soldiers circulated in the media and on Telegram channels - of the killing of civilians with their hands tied behind their backs, of rape, torture and looting - thousands of women rushed to sign up. Over the first weekend, more than 3,700 women enrolled, with 800 men also registering their interest. In the weeks since, thousands more have signed up, and there is now a waitlist of more than 6,300 women who want to learn how to shoot. For 51-year-old Natalia Anoshina, the idea that she might want to know how to handle a rifle was one she had never considered. But after hearing about the atrocities in Bucha, when her 18-year-old daughter suggested they sign up, she agreed. 'It's a nightmare, it's just horrific. My mind can't process this information, this dread,' she says of the events outside Kyiv. Dressed in a grey hoodie, jeans and purple Crocs, Natalia watches while her daughter, Anya, lies propped up on her elbows on the shooting range, and cocks the air rifle tucked into her shoulder to load it with a pellet. 'It makes you look at things with a different perspective,' she says. 'These are the things that lead you to some unexpected decisions. Now, anything could help you, like this shooting course.' Hamchuk, a former colonel in the Ukrainian army, is more forthright. 'Taking into consideration what is happening around Kyiv, I think everyone should hold a gun and defend our country,' he says, disassembling the Kalashnikov with a clatter. The shooting lessons, available every weekday in Litsey 20 and the four other schools in the city, are split into two parts: the basics of handling a Kalashnikov, and target practice on the shooting range with an air rifle. Those attending are not issued with guns afterwards, but, Martsinkiv says, 'the main point is to learn how to use it, so they are ready to use it', if and when the time comes. 'There is no fighting in Ivano-Frankivsk at the moment, but if war comes here it will be a different situation - we've seen what happened in Bucha and Irpin,' Martsinkiv adds. 'Women need to be ready, it's the task of the present day, the task of war.' As they take it in turns to shoot a cup off a chair, the women chat and laugh. But they become sombre when they discuss what motivated them to attend. Galina, a plumbing saleswoman from Ivano-Frankivsk, signed up for the sessions as soon as they were announced because she thinks that knowing how to handle a weapon is a useful skill in wartime. The events in Bucha, she says, were a painful confirmation that she had made the right decision. 'You need to know these skills and have the possibility to defend yourself in the future. I have a son and a husband who are in the army. But I need it for myself, in case of an emergency,' she says. 'It would be better if I don't ever need to, but at least I will know how to use it. What else can we do? It's just the state of life now.'

Olga Kolisnyk applied five weeks ago to take her two children - Illia, 11, and baby, Maria - to the UK from their home in war-torn Kharkiv but the process has been tied up in red tape. Kolisnyk, a university professor, was initially told by UK officials that her infant daughter would be allowed to travel as she had been added to her mother's Ukrainian passport. But two days later she was informed by visa officials in Sheffield that this would no longer be acceptable - and that Maria would have to undergo biometric scans 800 miles away in Warsaw before they would be able to fly to Britain. The demand was criticised as 'a scandal' on Sunday as the Guardian revealed further examples of UK bureaucracy preventing Ukrainians from fleeing to safety. They include: Only 6,600 Ukrainians have arrived in Britain in the five weeks since the Homes for Ukraine scheme launched, about 10% of the number of applicants. The government says it has stepped up the processing of visas in recent days and claims that some applicants are choosing to stay in neighbouring countries so they can return to Ukraine quicker. But leading charities, including the Refugee Council and British Red Cross, have said the bureaucracy involved was 'causing great distress to already traumatised Ukrainians'. Kate Larmer, who co-founded a group that has matched dozens of Ukrainians with families in Surrey, said the UK was failing those in desperate need: 'It's a scandal. We have families who could've moved to safety a long time ago.' Speaking from a village outside Kharkiv, the subject of heavy Russian bombing again last weekend, Kolisnyk said she was in fear for their lives. She said: 'While I'm still in Ukraine I will not feel safe. I hear somewhere not far from us the noise of bombing and I'm worrying about my family and especially my children. My only wish is to get visas for me and my son and for Maria - that's my only wish.' Kolisnyk, 38, who taught economics at Kharkiv's national university of radio electronics before the war, said she was terrified to make the day-long journey to Warsaw without any assurance that the visas would be approved and face having to make an 800-mile return journey into Ukraine. She said: 'I worried that I'm going to Poland to Vac [Visa Application Centre] and that at the end they will just refuse and then what will I do? It's my biggest fear. 'It's very, very stressful because of this uncertainty. I don't know how long we will wait. I would like to say that I want the UK to make this process more easy, especially if people want to travel with small children like my daughter.' Kolisnyk and her children are living with relatives in a small house outside Kharkiv, which borders the region where Vladimir Putin's forces launched a new offensive last week. Her sponsors are Andy Le Roux, a church pastor, and his wife, Kate Le Roux, in Odiham, Hampshire. 'It's just heartless and so inhumane,' said Kate Le Roux, a biomedical scientist. Le Roux, 45, said she had been reduced to tears after 'rude' government officials refused to clarify the matter and even suggested the family should seek refuge in a country with better weather than Britain. A government spokesperson said: 'Thanks to the generosity of the public who have offered their homes to Ukrainians fleeing the war and through the Ukraine family scheme, more than 71,800 visas have been granted with 21,600 Ukrainians arriving safely in the UK. 'The Home Office are now processing thousands of visas a day - this shows the changes made to streamline the service are working and we'll continue to build on this success so we can speed up the process even further.'", "a57549973f26f24760688af6c306794e62fa2882b12a50fecbdf46d8": "Emmanuel Macron is expected to announce a new prime minister in the coming days as he turns his focus to legislative elections in June after his defeat of Marine Le Pen in the presidential runoff on Sunday. The prime minister, Jean Castex, has said he will resign along with the government, allowing Macron to choose a fresh face and team for his second five-year term in office. Analysts suggest Macron may name Elisabeth Borne, the minister for work, as prime minister, only the second woman in France to hold the post. Others being touted for the Hotel de Matignon - Paris's equivalent of No 10 - include the finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, the interior minister Gerald Darmanin, or the agriculture minister, Julien Denormandie. Even before it was announced that Macron had been re-elected president on Sunday, attention had turned to the next electoral cycle. He will need his party, La Republique en Marche!, and its allies to achieve a majority to avoid the formation of a hostile government that could paralyse his programme. The task of appointing a new prime minister and cabinet is made particularly tricky as Macron will be looking to appeal to radical-left voters who backed Jean-Luc Melenchon in the first round of the presidential election while avoiding alienating supporters of Le Pen. Macron is facing demands to show he is president of 'all the French' after winning 58.54% - compared with Le Pen's 41.46% - of the vote in Sunday's second-round vote. His victory will be officially confirmed by the country's Constitutional Council on Wednesday. Castex could have been asked to stay on as prime minister, but told French radio earlier this month that France would be looking for a 'new driving force' if Macron won. Melenchon, who narrowly missed beating Le Pen in the first round of the presidential election, has called for voters to make him prime minister via the legislative elections on 12 and 19 June. While the prime minister is appointed by the president, who can in principle pick whoever they want, parliament has the power to force the resignation of the government so the choice of prime minister has to by political necessity reflect the will of the majority in parliament. Members of Melenchon's party, La France Insoumise (LFI), have been holding 'negotiations' with their counterparts at the Ecology-Green and the Communist parties with a view to joining forces in constituencies where a leftwing alliance could win enough seats to give them control of Assemblee Nationale, the lower house. A poll from Harris Interactive on Monday forecast Macron's party winning 326 to 366 seats, an outright majority in the 577 seat National Assembly, with 117 to 147 seats for the far-right and left-leaning parties reaching between 73 and 93 seats. Three political forces have emerged in France after the decline of the traditional centre-right Les Republicains and the centre-left Socialist Party: a pro-European centre represented by Macron's LREM flanked by a radical left represented by Melenchon and Le Pen's far right. Voters who reject Macron, but find the extremes hard to stomach - including the Greens - will have to choose a camp. Manon Aubry, a LFI MEP, said: 'We will create a union around a programme and a project. There are now three blocs in the country, the extreme right, the liberal right and our bloc. 'We have united lots of people behind us in this election and we can do more to give those who feel orphaned a place in our family. That's what the negotiations are about.' Macron has promised to find a response to the anger of those who supported the far right or abstained in the second round. 'I know a lot of my compatriots voted for me because they supported my ideas but also to block the far right's path to power. I want to thank them and tell them I'm aware of the responsibility their vote puts on me in the years to come,' he said. 'I'm no longer a candidate from one camp but the president of all. An answer must be found to the anger and disagreements that led many of our compatriots to vote for the far right. It will be my responsibility and that of those around me,' he added. Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder of the National Front, said his daughter had done 'everything she could'. 'It's now half a century that our ideas have progressed,' he told French journalists. 'There's time to organise the next victory.' Marine Le Pen has said the Rassemblement National is getting organised for the next 'great battle' in the legislatives. On Sunday night, Macron's representatives and members of his cabinet all faced the same question: who will be prime minister? All gave the same answer: It's for the president to decide. Elisabeth Borne, 61The employment minister, who was previously at the ecology and transport ministries, is a technocrat and former head of the Paris region's public transport system (RATP). She has served under the Socialist prime minister Lionel Jospin, and has been credited with a firm grasp on most subjects. Borne would be the second female French PM after Edith Cresson, who served for less than a year in office under President Francois Mitterrand between May 1991 and April 1992. Bruno Le Maire, 53The finance minister and former European affairs minister has the advantage of being on the right of centre and a traditionalist. He has been praised for his economic handling of Macron's 'whatever it costs' approach to the Covid crisis. Considered a loyal convert to Macronism despite having served in Nicolas Sarkozy's government. Richard Ferrand, 59A former member of the Socialist party and a former journalist, he was general secretary of Macron's new party and was named minister of territorial cohesion after Macron became president in 2017, but resigned after a month to become head of the LREM group in the Assemblee Nationale and then president of the lower house, a post he has held since. Julien Denormandie, 41The agriculture minister is often said to be a slightly younger Macron, albeit only by three years. Denormandie served as deputy chief of staff to Macron at the finance ministry when Socialist Francois Hollande was president. He helped set up La Republique en Marche! in 2016. Gerald Darmanin, 39The interior ministry is considered right wing and is often wrongly accused of calling Le Pen 'soft' on immigration, which was a sarcastic comment made during a debate. A divisive figure for the left and even among his colleagues, but ambitious.  Edouard Philippe, 51The mayor of Le Havre served as Macron's first prime minister between 2017 and 2020. A former Socialist then member of the centre-right UMP, Philippe had to handle the gilets jaunes movement, strikes and protests over Macron's controversial pension changes and the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. He resigned after the 2020 municipal elections and began his own political movement, Horizons, that many believe will be his springboard to a centre-right presidential bid in 2027. Christine Lagarde, 66The head of the European Central Bank and former director general of the International Monetary Fund, she was Sarkozy's economy minister. Lagarde has the experience and the competence but would be rejected as too economically liberal and globalist by the left, so would be an extremely divisive choice. Jean-Luc Melenchon, 70The LFI leader has demanded French voters make him PM in the forthcoming legislative elections after he narrowly missed out on the second-round presidential runoff by 420,000 votes. Detests Macron and would do all to stymie his programme. Not happening now and will only happen if he forces Macron's hand by winning a parliamentary majority in June.", "95bfcae3aa824f92584331ee70c4eedda01e90b00d684bf240ecf039": "Conservative whips have said they are trying to find out the identity of the Tory MP responsible for misogynistic attacks on Angela Rayner, with a view to taking disciplinary action after Boris Johnson threatened to unleash 'the terrors of the earth' against the culprit. The prime minister hit out at the 'sexist, misogynistic tripe' in the Mail on Sunday, which ran allegations from an anonymous MP that Rayner, Labour's deputy leader, deliberately tried to distract Johnson by crossing and uncrossing her legs in the House of Commons. Following outrage across Westminster, the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, told MPs on Monday that he had asked for a meeting with the Mail on Sunday editor, David Dillon, as well as the chair of the press gallery in the Commons. It comes after Caroline Nokes, the Conservative chair of the women and equalities committee, wrote to Hoyle asking him to look into revoking the parliamentary pass of the article's author, Glen Owen. Amid pressure to unmask the MP behind the claims, a source close to the whips said: 'Questions are being asked around the palace and if the anonymous source is identified, action will be taken.' However, their action appears to stop short of a formal investigation. The Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso) received more than 5,000 complaints about the story, which Rayner described as 'gutter journalism' while accusing the sources of 'spreading desperate, perverted smears in their doomed attempts to save [the prime minister's] skin'. The newspaper had reported that a Tory MP claimed Rayner was adopting a 'Basic Instinct' style ploy towards Johnson, in a reference to the Sharon Stone 1992 film in which she flashes a policeman during an interview. Following the outcry, a number of female MPs spoke of their own experiences of sexism in Westminster. Nokes told the Guardian's First Edition newsletter that she had once been the subject of an article along with former Tory MP Claire Perry 'that actually compared our boobs'. Labour MP Kim Leadbeater recounted how she had been in a meeting with a male MP who 'definitely spoke more comfortably ... to my male staff member than he did to me'. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, told BBC Radio 4 that a Tory MP had questioned how, with a newborn baby, she would have been able to be a cabinet minister if Labour had won the election. She said the slur against Rayner was 'the sort of thing that happens day in, day out in parliament'. The incident 'shines a spotlight' on other female MPs' experiences of sexism and misogyny, she said. 'I am sick and tired of the way that female MPs and women are treated in parliament, and if this story, this outrageous slur on Angela, gets change, that would be a good thing,' she said. Johnson suggested his party would investigate to find out who was responsible for the claims. Asked whether there was a cultural problem in parliament, Johnson said: 'It's hard to say on the basis of that particular story. But I have to say I thought it was the most appalling load of sexist, misogynist tripe. I immediately got in touch with Angela and we had a very friendly exchange.' In a reference to King Lear, he threatened to unleash 'the terrors of the earth' on the source behind the comments if they were identified. 'If we ever find who is responsible for it, I don't know what we will do, but they will be the terrors of the earth,' he said. 'It's totally intolerable, that kind of thing.'  The Speaker has not commented on the calls for Owen to lose his Commons pass but is expected to give Dillon a dressing down when he meets the newspaper's editor. There is also a precedent for a non-MP being hauled before the House of Commons itself to apologise for an article - in 1957. On that occasion, the editor of the Sunday Express, John Junor, was brought by the serjeant at arms to the bar and admonished by the Speaker for publishing an article that cast doubt on the integrity of MPs over their constituency petrol allowances. In the Commons on Monday, Hoyle said: 'I share the views expressed by a wide range of members ... that yesterday's article was reporting unsubstantial claims [that were] misogynistic and offensive. Those are what we believe. In being demeaning, offensive to women in parliament, it can only deter women who might considering standing for election, to the detriment of us all.' Earlier on Monday, Chris Philp, a junior minister, said he expected government whips would investigate and that if the source's identity emerged then he would 'imagine they would be subject to discipline'.Asked why Johnson and the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, had posted identical tweets denouncing the claims, Philp said this was 'nothing surprising' because they had 'reached the same view and they have used the same words'.", "8924fbc68548b495ee66c3e79fe41fafaa583be6d5c9257dcd28b077": "Priti Patel's refugee pushback policy has been officially withdrawn by the government days before a judicial review of the tactic was due to be heard in the high court. The government's legal department acknowledged in a letter on Sunday that the plan to try to force people in dinghies back to France has been abandoned after Boris Johnson's announcement that the Royal Navy would take over operations in the Channel. Patel's officials last week received notification that the Ministry of Defence, which is now in charge of picking up refugees in the Channel, did not have permission to use the tactic, the letter said. The policy, which was finalised in the autumn by the Home Office, authorised and encouraged Border Force officials to stop migrant vessels in UK waters and forcibly redirect them to return to France. In January, Patel said pushing back boats was 'absolutely still policy' when she gave evidence to the House of Lords justice and home affairs committee. In its letter, the legal department said the policy and procedures had been withdrawn and that the MoD joint commander had not had permission to authorise the use of turnaround tactics. The letter, which was signed on behalf of the solicitor general, said a 'significant development' had meant the case would no longer proceed. 'That development flowed from the prime minister's announcement on Thursday 14 April 2022 that the Ministry of Defence was taking over primacy in respect of Channel operations with regard to small boat crossings. As a result of a military order notified to the secretary of state for the home department's officials earlier on 20 April 2022, the Ministry of Defence joint commander has not had permission to authorise the use of turnaround tactics,' the letter said. It said that if a decision were taken to use turnaround tactics in the future, it would only be after a full consideration of all relevant matters. 'The secretary of state for the home department [Patel] has determined that: the policy and procedures, which are the subject of the ongoing litigation, are withdrawn; if a decision were taken to use turnaround tactics in the future, it would only be after a full consideration of all relevant matters, including the evolving nature of the small boats threat, migrant behaviour and organised criminal activity; and new policies, guidance and operational procedures would need to be formulated at that point.' Four organisations - the PCS union, Care4Calais, Channel Rescue and Freedom from Torture - had challenged the Home Office policy, with the applications set down for a three-day hearing on 3 May. The climbdown comes as the nationality and borders bill reaches its final stages in parliament. The Lords has twice rejected parts of the bill that would severely penalise refugees arriving in the UK without visas, in line with their rights under the refugee convention. Patel had repeatedly said there was a legal basis for the pushback policy despite introducing express powers to turn back boats in the nationality and borders bill on the basis that there was no such current legal power. The PCS general secretary, Mark Serwotka, said: 'This humiliating climbdown by the government is a stunning victory for Home Office workers and for refugees. There is little doubt that lives have been saved. 'The pushbacks manoeuvre is extremely dangerous and represents a clear risk to life and limb. We were simply not prepared to allow our members to be placed in this horrendous position.' Clare Moseley, the founder of Care4Calais, said: 'I find it hard to believe that anyone within government thought that performing pushbacks in the Channel was a viable policy.' Sonya Sceats, the chief executive of Freedom from Torture, said: 'This momentous climbdown by the government shows that change is possible when we come together. 'But we should never have had to take this government to court in order to defend the sanctity of life - it is scandalous that it reached this point.' Steven Martin of Channel Rescue said: 'Pushbacks are a reckless endangerment to life and we have always maintained and reminded the government that they are unlawful. The violent forcing back of people seeking protection is abhorrent and deprives them of their right to asylum.' The Guardian disclosed on Friday that unpublished parts of the proposed pushback policy said the tactic would not be used against asylum seekers. A government spokesperson said similar tactics might be deployed in the future, however these would only be used after full consideration of all relevant factors.'It is right that we consider all safe and legal options to stop these unnecessary journeys, including turning boats around.'As we have set out previously, this tactic fully complies with both domestic and international law, however, there are extremely limited circumstances when you can safely turn boats back in the Channel.'", "be30cc8b6e98fb3b99ba89e09723356d939d66cd80c4686ec1eccaea": "Thousands of potentially harmful chemicals could soon be prohibited in Europe under new restrictions, which campaigners have hailed as the strongest yet. Earlier this year, scientists said chemical pollution had crossed a 'planetary boundary' beyond which lies the breakdown of global ecosystems. The synthetic blight is thought to be pushing whale species to the brink of extinction and has been blamed for declining human fertility rates, and 2 million deaths a year. The EU's 'restrictions roadmap' published on Monday was conceived as a first step to transforming this picture by using existing laws to outlaw toxic substances linked to cancers, hormonal disruption, reprotoxic disorders, obesity, diabetes and other illnesses. Industry groups say that up to 12,000 substances could ultimately fall within the scope of the new proposal, which would constitute the world's 'largest ever ban of toxic chemicals', according to the European Environmental Bureau (EEB). Tatiana Santos, the bureau's chemicals policy manager, said: 'EU chemical controls are usually achingly slow but the EU is planning the boldest detox we have ever seen. Petrochemical industry lobbyists are shocked at what is now on the table. It promises to improve the safety of almost all manufactured products and rapidly lower the chemical intensity of our schools, homes and workplaces.' The plan focuses on entire classes of chemical substances for the first time as a rule, including all flame retardants, bisphenols, PVC plastics, toxic chemicals in single-use nappies and PFAS, which are also known as 'forever chemicals' because of the time they take to naturally degrade. All of these will be put on a 'rolling list' of substances to be considered for restriction by the European Chemicals Agency. The list will be regularly reviewed and updated, before a significant revision to the EU's cornerstone Reach regulation for chemicals slated for 2027. Chemicals identified in the new paper include substances in food contact materials, single-use nappies and PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) in granules for children playgrounds. But industry groups argue that the scheme's focus on groups of chemicals could affect high street products such as sun creams and perfumes, which may use a host of synthetic substances. 'A lot of different ingredients fall under the skin sensitiser group so a wide range of cosmetic products would potentially be affected,' said John Chave, the director general of Cosmetics Europe, a trade body. 'The effect on consumers would be that there would potentially be less variety, less choice and less functional effectiveness for cosmetic products with no gains for safety whatsoever because the ingredients were safe in the first place.' Beyond cosmetics, affected products could include paints, cleaning products, adhesives, lubricants and pesticides. Europe's Reach system is already the world's most extensive chemical register, and new bans could hit more than a quarter of the industry's annual turnover of around EUR500bn (PS420bn) per year, according to a study by the trade group Cefic. 'Some of the restrictions may have a significant impact on the industry and value chains,' said Heather Kiggins, a Cefic spokeswoman. The industry argues for a more narrowly targeted approach to restrictions, and for incentives and import controls to help develop safer alternative products. Nevertheless, the European Chemicals Agency favours dealing with chemicals in groups because chemical firms have previously avoided bans on individual chemicals by tweaking their chemical composition to create sister substances that may also be dangerous, but which then require lengthy legislative battles to regulate. The industry tactic, known as 'regrettable substitution', has been criticised by environmental groups for allowing the replacement of substances such as the endocrine-disrupting bisphenol A with other bisphenols. Santos described it as 'a cynical and irresponsible tactic by the chemical industry to replace the most harmful banned chemicals with similarly harmful ones not yet on the regulatory radar. We've witnessed a decades-long pattern of regrettable substitution to avoid regulation.' More than 190m synthetic chemicals are registered globally and a new industrial chemical is created every 1.4 seconds on average. The UN says that it expects the industry's global value of more than $5tn (PS3.9tn) to double by 2030 and to quadruple by 2060. The EU's environment commissioner, Virginijus Sinkevicius, said the new restrictions 'aim to reduce exposure of people and the environment to some of the most harmful chemicals, addressing a wide range of their uses - industrial, professional, and in consumer products'. The EU's internal markets commissioner, Thierry Breton, said achieving a toxic-free environment would demand transparency and visibility from the commission. 'The restrictions roadmap provides such visibility, and allows companies and other stakeholders to be better prepared for potential upcoming restrictions,' he said. Millions of tonnes of chemical substances were used by industrial giants such as BASF, Bayer, Dow Chemicals and ExxonMobil without completing safety checks between 2014 and 2019, according to research by German environmentalists.", "55bea273269334645784157f689a9bb632ff2323fc1db6ea3c6ede6b": "Left and liberal pro-EU politicians have welcomed the defeat of Slovenia's rightwing populist prime minister, Janez Jansa, to a political insurgent who has pledged to restore 'normality' to the central European nation. With nearly all ballots counted, political newcomer Robert Golob gained nearly 35% of the vote for his Freedom Movement launched in January. He is expected to form a government with the support of smaller leftwing groups, ending the hard-right government led by Jansa, who styled himself on Hungary's autocratic leader, Viktor Orban, and took nearly 24% of the vote. Pro-EU politicians reacted with delight to Golob's victory, which emerged as Emmanuel Macron beat his far-right rival, Marine Le Pen to take a second term as French president. 'These results are a bloody nose for illiberals and a chance to make Europe stronger,' said Stephane Sejourne, a Macron ally, who leads centrist MEPs in the European parliament. 'The EU [and] Slovenia is better off without the rightwing populist Janez Jansa, who attacked the free press [and] democratic institutions in Slovenia,' Sejourne said. The leader of the Socialist group in the European parliament, Iratxe Garcia Perez, said Slovenians had 'chosen change' and no longer wanted the 'populist and authoritarian' Jansa leadership. 'The Freedom Movement now has the opportunity to usher in a new era with a centre-left government that fully supports EU values,' she wrote. During Jansa's two-year government, Slovenia has experienced the sharpest democratic decline in eastern Europe and Central Asia, according to Freedom House. While the NGO noted that political rights and freedoms were 'generally respected' it said Jansa's government had made 'continued attempts to undermine the rule of law and democratic institutions, including the media and judiciary'. Florian Bieber at the University of Graz said it was a positive result for the EU. 'Janez Jansa has been a very disruptive figure, not just in Slovenia' he said. 'He encouraged the idea that he could export [Orban's] model of government to other countries and that has certainly been defeated in Slovenia and that is encouraging, so it suggests the limits of Orban's appeal.' Nika Kovac, director of the 8 March Institute, an NGO that ran a voter mobilisation drive, said that on Monday 'we woke up in a radically different Slovenia. It was a decision about which country we want to live in. I think people were voting not just for the party, but for the direction we need to go.' Turnout reached 70% of the 1.7 million electorate, much higher than the 52% of the previous election in 2018. Kovac said she had faced online abuse, including death threats and attacks on her appearance, from Jansa supporters. The 8 March Institute that she leads is calling on the new government to pass an 'omnibus law' that would repeal 11 decisions taken by the National Assembly during Jansa's term, including measures to safeguard the autonomy of police and bolster the rights of environmental campaigners in court proceedings. Jansa, leader of the Slovenian Democratic party, returned to power in March 2020, after two previous stints in office. He regained power when the previous centre-left prime minister resigned, saying he did not have enough votes to pass important legislation. The rightwing populist, who used Twitter to launch ad-hominem attacks on journalists, soon ran into conflict with the EU. For much of 2021 his government withheld funds from the Slovenian Press Agency, resulting in the organisation losing 10% of its journalists. He criticised the judiciary and claimed without evidence that the constitutional court was responsible for coronavirus deaths, after judges ruled that his government's Covid-19 legislation was incompatible with the constitution. 'He was pretending he was Orban who has an outright majority, which he [Jansa] never had, so in a certain way he was overplaying his hand,' said Bieber. The political scientist added that Jansa remained within the margin of his previous electoral score, so 'it's not that he lost a lot'. Jansa was one of the first EU leaders to visit Kyiv after the outbreak of war, but this failed to help him at the polls, said Bieber. 'There is a limit for populist nationalist conservative politics in Slovenia. That you can't really win elections with that alone.' During the campaign Golob promised to restore 'normality' and billed the elections as a 'referendum on democracy'. The former energy executive, who ran a company promoting solar power, is also calling for a green energy transition. Analysts say it remains to be seen whether Golob can overcome the difficulties that have beset previous political startups on the centre-left, which have fizzled out amid infighting and organisational problems.  'The problem with these kind of parties is that they don't have apparatus, they don't have experience, they don't have knowledge how to run governmental policies and this after a year or two could create a lot of tensions,' said political analyst Miha Kovac, who is the father of Nika Kovac. 'There is a serious danger that Slovenia will become politically unstable in a year or two,' he said. Meanwhile Jansa, one of Slovenia's longest-serving politicians, is expected to continue to lead his party. 'He is irremovable, he is there for eternity,' said Miha Kovac. 'He is the most experienced person in the Slovenian parliament. He will take a holiday now, I assume, and then he will wait for his chance to jump in when he sees the first sign of governmental coalition falling apart.'", "3fdd2695d996c2553e8662699c3d23af90e29852699af7d56c89fb03": "A US climate activist has died after he set himself on fire outside the US supreme court building in Washington. Wynn Bruce, from Boulder, Colorado, died on Saturday from his injuries, Washington's Metropolitan Police Department said. Police said Bruce had set himself on fire at about 6.30pm on Friday, and was airlifted to hospital. A spokeswoman for the Metropolitan police told the Denver Post that investigators had not found a manifesto or note explaining Bruce's motive. Friday was Earth Day, an annual global event to demonstrate support for environmental protection, and the supreme court has environmental cases on its docket. Bruce, 50, had recently edited a comment on his Facebook page, adding the date 22 April and a fire emoji. The comment was in response to a post about the global impact of climate change. Bruce had posted several times over the past year about the environment. On Sunday, Kritee Kanko, a Boulder-based climate scientist and Zen Buddhist priest, said Bruce was a friend and member of her Buddhist community, who had been planning the self-immolation for 'at least one year'. 'This act is not suicide. This is a deeply fearless act of compassion to bring attention to climate crisis,' Kanko said in a tweet. In a subsequent interview with the New York Times, Kanko said she could not be certain about Bruce's intentions. She told the newspaper that 'people are being driven to extreme amounts of climate grief and despair' and that 'what I do not want to happen is that young people start thinking about self-immolation'. In April 2018 David Buckel, a prominent gay rights lawyer and environmental advocate, burned himself to death in New York. In a note, Buckel said: 'Most humans on the planet now breathe air made unhealthy by fossil fuels, and many die early deaths as a result - my early death by fossil fuel reflects what we are doing to ourselves.'", "2f252c177454318623e532dd06b4ea663910689ca52bcdd7fc0ac958": "A jihadist group in Mali claims to have captured a fighter from the Kremlin-linked Wagner mercenary group reportedly fighting Islamist militants in the west African country. 'In the first week of April, [we] captured a soldier of the Russian Wagner forces in the Segou region in central Mali,' the GSIM (the Group to Support Islam and Muslims) said in a statement sent to AFP overnight. It is the first time the GSIM, an al-Qaida-linked alliance and the biggest jihadist network in the Sahel, has announced the capture of a fighter with the Wagner group. The US, France and others say Russian paramilitaries in Mali are operatives from the private security firm Wagner, which has also been accused of abuses in the Central African Republic. Mali's military-dominated government has denied the accusations and said the Russians in the country were military instructors. The GSIM statement said 'these murderous forces participated with the Malian army in an airdrop operation on a market in the village of Moura, where they confronted several mujahideen before encircling this locality for five days and killing hundreds of innocent civilians'. The Russian mercenaries also carried out two parachute operations in central Mali, claimed the jihadist group, which said its fighters had confiscated weapons 'from the mercenaries who fled'. Vast swathes of Mali lie beyond government control due to the brutal conflict, which began in 2012 before spreading to neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger. France, which intervened in Mali in 2013, decided in February to withdraw its forces from the country after a decade-long fight against jihadists. The Sahel country is led by a military junta that seized power in a coup in 2020. The junta initially promised to restore civilian rule, but it failed to meet an earlier commitment to west African bloc Ecowas to stage elections in February this year, prompting regional sanctions. Last month, the military-dominated government in Bamako said it 'neutralised' 203 jihadists in the central village of Moura, but witnesses interviewed by media and Human Rights Watch say scores of civilians were killed. The UN's Minusma force has been asking the Malian authorities in vain to allow it to visit Moura to investigate the events.", "3071eaf45b99b862c3fc0b8ad7701331b298b26d8572ae5c175795bf": "British universities are facing a brain drain as the row over Brexit in Northern Ireland threatens PS250m in research funding from the EU, it has emerged. The European Research Council (ERC) has written to 98 scientists and academics who were recently approved for EUR172m (PS145m) in grants telling them that if the UK's associate membership of the EUR80bn Horizon Europe programme is not ratified they will not be eligible to draw down the money. Scientists have said they are now scrambling to find alternative EU institutions to host the funding, with some already turning down the ERC money and hoping the UK government's promise of replacement cash will be delivered. But they say in either case it is 'devastating' as the ERC is considered one of the most prestigious programmes in the world. Getting an ERC grant is 'a badge of honour for any researcher and a signal of world-class leading research' that is a big draw for talent from the US and elsewhere, said Ethan Ilzetzki, an associate professor in economics at the London School of Economics. 'Higher education institutions on the continent are salivating at the prospect of poaching this talent ... higher education will be hurt for years to come if this isn't resolved,' he said. The then Brexit secretary David Frost fought hard to get associate membership of Horizon Europe as part of the trade deal negotiations in 2020 but ratification has been delayed while the UK fails to implement the Northern Ireland protocol. UK scientists say they are being punished. Payam Gammage, a scientist at the Beatson Institute at Glasgow University, said: 'It is a strange choice for the EU. The UK isn't going to notice it immediately. It will take a long time to have any impact. All that happens is a bunch of scientists have a lot of opportunities taken away, or their lives just made a lot more difficult. We're the only victims.'  Gammage was awarded EUR2m to expand research on mitochondrial genetics and mutations in tumours, but has decided to turn down the ERC grant and apply for replacement funding from the UK Research and Innovation fund. He said this was not the same as there was no detail about the terms and conditions of funding. 'The idea that the UK could replicate the system and apparatus of something like the ERC in the near to medium term is, at best, unrealistic,' Gammage said. Thiemo Fetzer, a professor of economics at Warwick University who was approved for EUR1.5m of funding, said: 'We all had reason to believe that the UK association was just a matter of the UK implementing the free trade agreement. Now we are waking up to the reality. It is very devastating.' A molecular biologist who was awarded EUR2m for a five-year research programme said she would now be looking to commute to Ireland or Belgium. 'My main priority is getting the funding because an award at this level of funding happens once in a lifetime,' she said. Starter grants are worth EUR1.5m each and consolidator grants are worth up to EUR2m each, with a further round of advanced grants due to be awarded next month worth up to EUR2.5m each, which could take the overall UK funding to about EUR300m. The science minister, George Freeman, has pledged to extend the guaranteed replacement funding until December 2022. The ERC president, Prof Maria Leptin, said she was 'fervently hoping' that the UK-EU negotiations would be finalised and 'result in association' with Horizon Europe. 'Our letters to grantees had to point out the option for portability of the grant outside the UK, but nobody here has any wish at all to entice anyone to leave the UK,' she said. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the delay in ratification was causing 'uncertainty for researchers, businesses and innovators based in the UK, and [has] been detrimentally affecting important collaborations between the UK and European partners.'", "5f6cd42d089512e491d78c2598bb461d147ec9ed39edc0750440d29b": "Hong Kong's Foreign Correspondents' Club has scrapped its annual human rights press awards just days before it was due to announce winners, out of fear it would violate the city's wide-ranging national security law. The decision sparked a number of resignations from the club's press freedom committee, and public criticism from journalists and former award winners, who described the move as sad, and evidence that it could no longer serve in its mission to defend the press. The FCC's president, Keith Richburg, told its members in an email on Monday that the club was 'suspending' the award pending further review. 'Over the last two years, journalists in Hong Kong have been operating under new 'red lines' on what is and is not permissible, but there remain significant areas of uncertainty and we do not wish unintentionally to violate the law,' it said. 'This was a very tough decision to reach. We explored a variety of other options, but could not find a feasible way forward.' The FCC board held a meeting on Saturday, where the question of suspension was put forward, the Guardian understands, and some members shared legal advice they had obtained which said the club and individuals related to it would be at risk of being investigated by national security police if the awards went ahead. A majority of board members voted in favour of a suspension. The national security law was imposed by Beijing in June 2020 following pro-democracy protests and criminalises what it terms acts of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces. Hong Kong authorities have launched a comprehensive crackdown on the city's once-free media in the two years since. Several major titles have been shuttered, journalists arrested, correspondents denied visas, and public broadcasters muzzled. A widely documented chilling effect has left the remaining media in fear of persecution and sources too afraid to speak on the record. The Guardian also understands there was extensive discussion at the FCC board's Saturday meeting of the club's dual roles to support foreign correspondents in Hong Kong and as a business that operates a social venue in the city with more than 100 employees and a large number of non-journalist associate members. Following a meeting of the club's press freedom committee the next day, several members announced their resignation from the committee over the decision. The Washington Post's bureau chief, Shibani Mahtani, a member of press freedom committee for three years and also a board member, urged club members and others who benefited from it to 'take a long hard look at the club they pay to belong to'. 'As a former winner and judge of the HRPA, I feel nothing but the deepest regret and do not stand by this decision,' she said, adding that the award was meaningful not just to Hong Kong journalists but those covering stories across the region, including in Afghanistan. '[The suspension] is emblematic too of the self-censorship many institutions feel forced to subject themselves to in today's Hong Kong, whether with or without their merits, and entirely indicative of how the national security law has changed the landscape for all,' she said. 'I have strongly recommended to the FCC president and its current board that we should seriously rethink the role of the press freedom committee, and the club as a whole. I believe it is no longer able to serve its core mission: to defend and promote the press.' Some Hong Kong journalists lamented the decision as sad but unsurprising. Timothy McLaughlin, a contributing writer to the Atlantic and former HRPA winner, said he was sad and angered to see the award cancelled. McLaughlin also noted it appeared the FCC had recently removed a statement of its 'core mission' from the front page of its website. Sum Lok-kei, an independent Hong Kong journalist who has reported for the Guardian, described the decision as self censorship and 'an insult to the outlets [and] journalists that still work in HK, especially outlets which officials have named [or] sent letters to before'. In its statement, the FCC said the decision 'in no way reflects the FCC board's view of the content of any of the entries or the work of the independent judges'. 'The FCC intends to continue promoting press freedom in Hong Kong, while recognising that recent developments might also require changes to our approach.' The awards were due to be announced on world press freedom day, on 3 May.", "63e0a681f53227234748dd3374dafc4724d73b79ee9a7ce4e576ace6": "Snowy northern winters tend to see a drop in asylum seekers crossing from the United States into Canada at Roxham Road in Quebec. Not this past winter. In December, the number of asylum seekers entering Canada outside formal land border crossings reached its highest point since August 2017, government statistics show. The growing caseload is lengthening wait times for eligibility hearings, leaving claimants waiting months on social assistance before getting work permits, one attorney said. The increase follows the lifting of a pandemic-era order in December. Since March 2020, border police had refused entry to all asylum seekers in order to curb the spread of Covid. 'It seems to me the ministry has been caught off guard,' said Montreal lawyer Pierre-Luc Bouchard, who has 70 refugee cases after two years with almost zero new clients. 'They are completely confused.' A spokesperson for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada said that the increase was expected and said the agency is working to speed up applications and shorten eligibility hearing wait times. In December, Royal Canadian Mounted Police intercepted 2,811 asylum seekers crossing the border outside formal land ports of entry, the vast majority crossing into Quebec. In January and February they intercepted 2,382 and 2,164, respectively - compared with 888 and 808 in January and February of 2019. These asylum seekers can enter Canada because they do not enter at formal border crossings. Under the Safe Third Country Agreement - which is set to be contested at Canada's supreme court - Canada and the United States can turn back asylum seekers in either direction at formal land border crossings. Volunteers who come to the border bearing water bottles or mittens and who try to ensure border-crossers' rights are respected have resumed their weekly trips to Roxham Road after suspending them during the pandemic, said Frances Ravensbergen, a coordinator for migrant advocacy group Bridges Not Borders. Some asylum seekers 'have kind of waited for the borders to reopen', Bouchard said. Roxham Road, north of Plattsburgh, New York, is not a formal border crossing, although so many asylum seekers use it that police officers are often stationed there to intercept migrants. Some would-be refugees were waiting in the United States, others in Latin America or in Kenya until they felt they could make the trip to Canada via the United States, Bouchard said. Canadian refugee claimants come from a range of countries, including Mexico, Colombia, India and Iran. Many keep abreast of Canada's shifting regulations, 'sometimes with some confusion', Bouchard said. But Bouchard thinks there is more than just Canada's lifted border closure at play. 'People are desperate,' he said. He said the increase was also an indication that 'under Joe Biden the (US) immigration policies have not really, really changed,' especially regarding gender-based refugee claims, which are seen as less likely to succeed in the United States. US apprehensions of migrants crossing from Mexico reached a 20-year high last year, and the Biden administration has been reluctant to roll back all the measures imposed by Donald Trump. The US government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Nicaraguan asylum seeker described how he flew into the southern United States, where he was reunited with his wife and children, who had traveled separately. They flew to New York, where they boarded a bus to Plattsburgh in upstate New York and then took a taxi to the Canadian border. Canadian police were friendly, he said. Now he and his family are living in a Montreal apartment. His kids are in school and he hopes to find work soon. 'It was a hard trip ... everything is in Nicaragua,' he said. 'But my mind is positive and I expect that we are going to do well here.'", "ddd7a67a079abc99e7ab8c39e944172085b411757370f305443f0b47": "", "00a698b642950727f9112db2534c2f61a3d4b9f72fabeae31ba95e10": "", "aa0ac50f44edc4238d365af9add115fce2180585310616e49cc4ae9d": "", "ad2156b9f7981e5eb8929f83c7d31a99f9d1f427293f0861fca76599": "", "52e412e39851e13ce006304f2d2435509667a6e2deae9cac7c99816d": "", "33dfb3037632cf963bb886f92a553aa319b05527e3cc93849271cadd": "He came on horseback and  wore a scowl as he spoke, telling thousands of yellow-clad believers they faced a momentous battle of good versus evil. 'Good has always triumphed - and this time it will be no different. Good will prevail!' the outsider bellowed as his followers encircled the stage that had been erected to welcome him to this sweltering satellite town in north-east Brazil. The speech-maker was Jair Bolsonaro, the Bible-quoting, far-right populist championed in almost celestial terms by his supporters. 'I love him. He's my warrior,' said Diego Rodrigues da Silva, 27, an evangelical Christian who had ridden to the event on a bicycle painted with the word 'Jesus'. 'Wherever he goes, I go too,' said Rosaria Valente, 65, from the Amazon city of Belem. She called Bolsonaro 'the only real president I've ever seen'. Minutes later, the throng erupted in euphoric cheers as their trailblazer arrived on a white horse with his country's yellow and green flag draped over its neck. 'Brazil above everything,' Bolsonaro shouted. 'God above all,' they screamed back - the slogan of Bolsonaro's illiberal administration since his shock 2018 election win. That administration will seek to extend its stay in power in October when 150 million Brazilians choose the next leader of Latin America's biggest democracy. With the struggle for power intensifying, Bolsonaro has been touring the country in an effort to project strength and popularity and win back millions of voters who abandoned him as a result of his bungled response to Covid and the consequent economic and social pain. 'All of us have a mission here on Earth and my mission was one of the thorniest a head of state could face,' Bolsonaro told the Parnamirim rally, defending his handling of a disease which has killed more than 660,000 Brazilians and against which he claims not to have been vaccinated. At the start of this year some Bolsonaro opponents hoped his chances of a second term had evaporated, with polls showing a yawning gap between the former army captain and his leftist rival, the ex-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Bolsonaro remains the underdog, abhorred by millions of citizens and shunned by much of the international community for his assault on Brazil's environment and democracy. More than half of Brazilians say they would never vote for him. But in recent weeks Bolsonaro's polling has improved, dashing progressive predictions that he was out for the count. 'I don't think the election is won - far from it,' said Jairo Nicolau, the author of a book exploring Bolsonaro's astonishingly resilient support base. Nicolau still considered Lula the clear favourite thanks to his popularity among female voters, north-easterners and the poor. But the election is still six months away and the spell Bolsonaro has cast over many conservatives - a 'cultural phenomenon' Nicolau likens to Trumpism - meant he was no ordinary foe. Barring economic meltdown, millions of Bolsonaro voters would stand by their man. 'It's truly remarkable. He has established a rapport with part of Brazil that's really rare for a politician. It's almost as if he's a footballing idol ... They see Bolsonaro as a hero,' Nicolau said. Such veneration is obvious in Parnamirim, a conservative city that grew around an airbase built to support allied efforts in the second world war and is home to many military officials. 'He's a visionary,' said Marcelo Chianca, 73, who cruised to the airport to greet Bolsonaro on his three-wheeled motorcycle. White, well educated and well-off, Chianca, a wine-loving retired economist, is a typical representative of Bolsonaro's base. But he also enjoys support on Parnamirim's dilapidated outskirts, partly thanks to billions of pounds in welfare payments being dished out ahead of the vote. 'He has a real connection to the poor,' said Ana Paula da Silva, an evangelical 29-year-old who is pregnant with her fourth child and survives on an PS80 monthly government allowance called Auxilio Brasil. Logic suggested her husband would support Lula. Ronaldo Cavalcante was born into rural poverty in the same town, Garanhuns, as Brazil's first working-class president. He once worked for one of Lula's cousins. But Cavalcante, a 38-year-old gardener, was also a Bolsonaro fan and said he would consider giving their unborn child the president's second name, Messias. 'It's a beautiful name, isn't it?' he said. 'To tell you the truth, of all the politicians we've had, the one I've most admired is him.' The potentially tight nature of what looks set to be a two-horse race between Bolsonaro and Lula has left many bracing for a fraught and possibly violent period. Adding to those fears are the tens of thousands of firearms that have gone into circulation under a pro-gun president who has dramatically loosened gun laws. Critics accuse Bolsonaro of inviting disorder with his confrontational language. 'An armed population will never be enslaved,' he told supporters in Parnamirim, several of whom wore T-shirts stamped with images of revolvers or assault rifles. Elisangela Silva da Costa Palombo, a leftwing activist and teacher who lives nearby, voiced outrage at the divisive 'good and evil' rhetoric being used by Bolsonaro. 'No matter how many times he says he represents good, he's actually evil disguised as good - and people are waking up to this,' she said. Lindomar Alves de Sousa, a softly spoken evangelist who was part of Bolsonaro's reception committee, recognised the president's 'brutish style' but said it was necessary as he was striving to save Brazil from what he called communist totalitarianism. 'He's not a polished guy - but he's doing what we want done,' the 58-year-old preacher said after evening worship in his church, Heal Our Land. The next morning Sousa joined Bolsonaro on stage in Parnamirim wearing a yellow jersey symbolising his loyalty. 'God lifted up this man and no one touches those lifted up by God - no one!' the evangelist proclaimed, urging supporters to raise their arms in prayer. 'Our dear father, we thank you for the life of our president. It was for this moment in history that you raised him up - and you, Lord, will sustain him.' As Bolsonaristas streamed out of the event they passed the right-wing activist Walter Sabino, who was hawking copies of a self-published book denouncing a supposed leftwing media conspiracy against the president. 'Why did I write this?' Sabino asks in the introduction to 'Bolsonaro v The Press: Distortions, Lies and Fake News'. 'Simple: because I believe in my country and I do not want it to be seized by the left again ... I believe I'm one of millions of cogs God is using to rescue this nation.' Sabino, 39, claimed Bolsonaro was being unfairly demonised by leftist infiltrators in the media: 'They paint him as a monster ... but increasingly people realise he's nothing of the sort: that he's a simple, common, good person.' Suddenly, Bolsonaro devotees spotted their captain departing via light railway and Sabino's voice was overwhelmed by their exhilarated chants. 'Do you really think a person like this will come second?' the author wondered as his compatriots howled in delight. 'No way! It's a lie!'", "b8c41b084c6456c3adffb39b7bc1b3af516d070af22c4d4fe93e67ad": "", "2aa562364ed9abe644e721666da59d2f22231e1c21b7ec1ef38dcdc3": "The faces of two clearly exhausted adults appear on a screen at the front of the room. They wish to be identified only as parents from Texas. 'I don't know what I look like on your end,' the mother says, 'but I know I look like death on my end, so it can't be good on the Zoom screen.' Her description of her appearance matches the mood in the room at the Human Rights Campaign headquarters in Washington DC where about two dozen parents of trans kids sit in a large semicircle. They're here for an annual weekend of meetings oganized by HRC Parents for Trans Equality Council (PTEC), a group organized to give a voice to parents of trans kids in advocating to the media and elected representatives. Tonight's meeting couldn't have been better timed. I was there on 11 March to listen in on a roundtable. This was right as the Florida legislature was passing the 'don't say gay' bill and the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, was moving to classify gender-affirming care for trans minors as child abuse. Across the country, more than 300 anti-LGBTQ+ bills have been filed this legislative year, according to HRC. Most of them target transgender children, a demographic not even old enough to vote against the politicians setting policy. A few weeks after the PTEC gathering, Alabama passed a series of bills that essentially make it illegal to be a trans minor in the state. I doubt it will be the last state to do so since this has become the de facto big issue for the US conservative movement - and Democrats seem reluctant to fight back too forcefully. The woman on the screen goes on to explain her attorney advised her not to publicly advocate for herself or her trans child, and that her family took down all outward displays of support for LGBTQ+ people, like the Pride flag outside their home. 'It feels really bad to hear from people across the country that we just need to leave Texas because our experience here is not what we experience in the legislature,' she says. 'We have an affirming community, [and] we don't experience discrimination in a way that so many people do in other states and in other areas of Texas.' Balancing raising their families while also advocating on behalf of their children's lives is weighing heavily on all these parents. Jose Trujillo, father of a trans boy in Arizona, speaks about how he sacrificed to become a naturalized citizen so that his kids could have freedoms that he didn't have before becoming a citizen. But now, he lives in a state that introduced more anti-trans bills than any other in the country. 'I felt what it feels like to not be sort of an outcast,' he tells the roundtable. 'I'm thinking when I have my children and they're born in this soil, they're gonna have a completely different experience. And then I see this happening and it just makes me angry.' Over the phone days later Jose's wife, Lizette, told me their 14-year-old son had what she called a 'typical' transgender childhood. Early on, she gendered her kid a lot, pushing pink and princesses, but her child instantly rejected it. She remembers a friend of her kid, then age eight, running up and asking: 'Hey can he and I go play in the soccer field?' 'The friend's mom corrected her son. And the friend looked at us and said, 'No, he's a he, can we go play?'' Lizette recalled. That interaction prompted her to broach the topic with her child, who told her that in his heart he is a boy. 'From that moment on, we supported him,' she said. Initially they were met with resistance from some family and friends. A close friend of hers warned against telling anyone about her son's gender identity, for fear that someone might call Child Protective Services. It took eight months for Lizette to find a support group to help start working through it all. Thankfully, her son's school was supportive and had experience with other trans children, wiping a big worry out of Lizette's mind. She cut some family members out of their lives to protect her son, though many have eventually come around. 'It was really painful to have your child, this person that you would give your life for, to have them rejected by people who are supposed to love them,' she said. 'I took that very hard, very personally. Why wouldn't you love him?' Another parent, Stephen Chukumba, from New Jersey, is one of the most vocal of the group. 'I have a trans son and I'm really upset that in 2022, three months in, six transgender people have already been killed, and states are actively moving to further marginalize transgender people as if we are some huge threat,' he said, his voice ringing with emotion. 'It doesn't seem that enough people are taking what's happening to us seriously, and it bothers me, it angers me, it upsets me and it frightens me.' A week later, over Zoom, Chukumba, a widower and single father, told me gender wasn't a big deal in his household. All four of his kids - boys ages 20, 18, 15 and 12 - have long dreadlocks and have always dressed in fairly gender non-descript ways. His 15-year-old, who Chukumba didn't want to name for privacy reasons, came out as trans five years ago. Chukumba said that it was often easier to take the kids to Osh Kosh B'Gosh and buy them all T-shirts and slacks, including his trans son before he transitioned. As a result Chukumba would find himself correcting strangers who often perceived all of his kids were boys. His trans son later told him that he didn't mind being called one of the boys. 'Thinking back to it, he never, ever corrected people,' Chukumba said. 'He would just go along with it.' He recalled a moment from about a year ago when his son's identity finally clicked for him. His son knocked on Chukumba's bedroom door and asked to come in. 'I'm like, 'What do you want?'' he recalled. 'He just kept staring at me and a little smile crept across his face and literally in that moment was the first time I saw my son. Like I saw just the dude. I didn't see the assignment at birth.' It was a critical moment for Chukumba. He realized then that he needed to start preparing the teenager for life as a Black man. He said he'd always told his cisgender sons to do push-ups around the house, so he he started to include his trans son. He also realized he had never taught the trans teen to dap up - greeting one another with a fist bump. 'No child of mine is not going to know how to dap up another brother,' he said. 'I had been derelict in my responsibility in raising a Black male child not showing him how to be appropriate in situations with other Black men.' At the PTEC meeting , Chukumba provides the emotional backbone of the evening's discussion. 'It's quickly becoming apparent that there is no safe space for us, and how is that tenable?' he asks late in the discussion, his voice crackling as he begins to cry. 'I'm already dealing with intersectionality with a Black trans child and now I have to think about what states can you live in. I will have to accept that somebody could decide that you represent something that they hate and that's it.' As I'm packing up my things after the roundtable ends, a group of parents asks me to join them for dinner. We laugh and talk over Italian food in downtown DC, which feels like a respite from the hostile world outside. Shortly after the appetizers, one of the parents stands up, phone in hand. 'The judge enjoined the Texas action!' he yells, referring to a decision by a local judge in Texas to put Abbott's child abuse order on hold. Cheers go up in our section, and tears are shed. After an evening of long, hard, emotional testimony by a group of loving parents who feel beaten but not defeated, it was a much needed victory. Chukumba had perhaps best articulated earlier in the evening the fight that lies ahead for both trans people and the parents who love us. 'With the last sinew in our body, with the last breath, we will fight to make sure our children have a place in the society where they can stand with their heads held high, not afraid, knowing they're entitled to the same rights and liberties that everybody else has in this world,' he said. 'I just refuse to allow this shit to go down without a fight.'", "872a2eae1563a96dc923777698d824ef2510e18f9f65491f918c950a": "", "4e5874f8bec324dbbfa2513ba977d675ba6ca50afc5611b333839a85": "", "9f41a814c0f1affce7ae9048d08b68cafd208467167253a8d003a09c": "", "b1227115a951e8f046d61dc1a50f84eecedf547855a7759c97001b06": "", "6ed1aa34873847ecc6a3c2d53ab79eb6d216d2ce07b4478e0771dd9e": "", "8e93c3c0bd8f6839bb0ac1ce0f81a62fca3b5d38c31e1ff2386be028": "", "6d4d411035b6b8a3e2a272dcdcf15a4348c5e82156a9aac8235ec0db": "", "f970b11695bd41227167624a8708ccd4326d3dd774bb9d6bac53b116": "", "641f046f120ef772cb3e865b02fb09cbe73de072770f5d65bf23b33c": "", "8cbf379b9c0ffc870d0998a8e698256b0b2909ee415a0036e856ba1a": "", "8392364f9cf82e377fa1c7ec30a138702a058808d611839531981049": "", "6ba399e5c814b95d91222a1f11984c3252404f79998d1ae6a8798316": "", "7bbd43fc3c831ffe9e122c81dd6f895c535cf8241875d7f21e4a1bd1": "", "cd245fb19621ff3f23515cd76a45f1a81bef7696c4590180842c36f4": "", "18701fe140536f25676f1eb554216ae23bca3b53f47549cd01882de0": "", "c0a5680057c4124a89280d7cbe1e676b16f907ca25926e8849701893": "The buskers are out, hotels are full, archaeological sites are heaving, shopkeepers are smiling, and good luck if you want a table in a decent restaurant. It might be April but Athens is alive to the sound of tourists. In all his years keeping watch over 1st-century BC ruins, Stelios Ballas, who is in his 50s, can barely recall so many visitors picking their way through the scattered antiquities of the Roman agora. 'These past few weeks have been something else,' he says from his guard's cabin nestled under a plane tree. 'I talk to some of them and they seem to be from everywhere. The thing is, do they have money and are they willing to spend it?' Around the corner on Adrianou Street, the Greek capital's oldest commercial thoroughfare, restaurateurs are not asking that question - for now. Not since 2019, when Greece attracted a record 33 million holidaymakers, has business been as good. 'If it goes on like this we'll be talking about a brilliant year,' smiles Vassilis Stathokostopoulos, who runs the recently upgraded all-day bistro Ydria. 'Perhaps it's our new chef but people are not only coming, it's clear that after everything we've all been through, they want to have a good time. And for that they're willing to dig deep into their pockets.' In a country so dependent on tourism - the sector accounts for 25% of Greece's economic output and one in four jobs - the rebound has surprised even those who are in the business of being optimistic. Athens has seen more upheaval in recent years than other EU metropolises, hit first by a near decade-long financial crisis that made its streets synonymous with protests and riots before the coronavirus struck. The pandemic-induced hiatus resulted in tourist revenues dropping from EUR18.2bn in 2019 to EUR4bn in 2020 when, in a record slump, the nation logged only 7 million arrivals. Although earnings from the industry exceeded EUR10bn, better than expected, last year when Greece opened its borders in May, they were still well short of pre-pandemic takings. But this year, despite the unexpected spectre of war returning to Europe in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, industry figures are confident that recovery has finally come. For the first time since 2019 cruise ships are pulling into Greek ports - testimony, say industry officials, to the desire of travellers to put the pandemic behind them. Pre-paid flight bookings are also on the rise. 'All omens look positive,' says Andreas Andreadis, a former tourism boss and chief executive of the phenomenally successful Sani/Ikos group of luxury resorts. 'For a few weeks after the start of the war in Ukraine demand dropped but since the end of March it has picked up and is now excellent.' Holidaymakers, he says, are still less inclined given the spread of Covid to travel long-haul, preferring destinations in Europe. 'And the truth is there are not so many options with quality destinations,' he says. In an unprecedented step aimed at capitalising on the hunger of people to travel, the tourist season kicked off earlier in Greece this year. Last week, officials announced that pandemic restrictions, including the requirement of presenting an EU digital Covid certificate to enter the Mediterranean nation, would be lifted from 1 May and reviewed in September. What was seen as Athens' relatively successful handling of the pandemic last year has also helped revive the sector, despite public health authorities registering a sharp rise in Covid deaths since because of lower vaccination rates. 'The season has begun earlier than ever before,' says Vasilis Kikilias, the Greek tourism minister, noting that the first direct flight from the US, a key market for the economy, flew in on 7 March. 'It's a vote of confidence in our country.' The decision to open earlier appears to have paid off: bookings soared over Easter. As Greeks also prepare to mark the holiday - returning en masse to their ancestral villages for the first time since the outbreak of the pandemic to celebrate the most important religious event in the Orthodox calendar - authorities say they show no sign of tapering off. Airlines, says Kikilias, are not only competing over slots to Greece this summer, but 765 cruise ships are lined up to anchor in ports around the country, with popular island destinations such as Mykonos, Kos and Corfu already drawing crowds. 'It's a fact borne out by every study that people don't just want to travel, they need to travel,' says Eugenios Vasilikos, the vice-president of the Panhellenic Federation of Hoteliers. 'All the signs point to this being a very good year.' By 2023, the capital will have acquired an additional 5,000 hotel rooms compared with 2019 when a city once bypassed for the islands managed to attract 5 million visitors. The investment frenzy, evident in a construction boom now changing the face of downtown Athens, is also indicative of the hopes entrepreneurs have placed in the revival of Greece's heavy industry. But Vasilikos, at the hoteliers' federation, concedes there is little room for complacency. The glimpse of a carefree world that has revisited Athens as tourists amble through its sites and streets is also fraught with the dangers inherent in a cost of living crisis and spiralling inflation rates being felt globally. Unions representing Greeks who earn some of the lowest wages in the European Union have taken to the streets. 'A few weeks ago I might not have been so optimistic,' he says of reservations in the capital. 'All the data points to last-minute bookings in our hotels which while costs are rising also have some of the lowest price rates in Europe. People aren't sure of anything any more. They wait until the last minute, and, in the last minute, anything can change.'", "7833c9444074efd55065652fe73600928ac58a77ef7d06021b50d345": "Before Russia's tanks, daubed with their infamous Z, rolled into Ukraine, Oleg Ustenko's advice to president Volodymyr Zelenskiy had focused on pension reform, privatisation and coaxing economic migrants to return. Nearly 60 days later, the pair are instead striving to hold together an economy that, even if Vladimir Putin's brutal bombardment were to end tomorrow, would be left in tatters. 'Everything that seemed incredible in the first week has got worse,' Ustenko told the Observer by telephone from battle-scarred Kyiv, where he learned his trade as an economist. 'Can you imagine the feeling of an economist after hearing that assets destroyed in the first week of the war were worth $100bn, half of our annual GDP?' The most terrible price paid by Ukrainians is, of course, the daily loss of life. But Ustenko, who was educated at Harvard and Kyiv's National Economic University, has to wrestle with the economic impact, which he estimates at $1tn so far. With half of the nation's businesses either shuttered or operating only partially, the economy is set to have shrunk by a quarter by next month. All state expenditure has been frozen, barring defence, social support and emergency funds to provide food, water and shelter for displaced people. The budget deficit has ballooned from an expected $7bn for the year to the same amount every month. Yet Ustenko believes in the power of economics to tackle the human cost of Russia's invasion - the death, destruction and atrocities emerging in Bucha and elsewhere. Key to this is convincing the west - and Europe in particular - to forsake Russian oil and gas and ramp up punitive sanctions on the Kremlin. The other mammoth task is to start planning for the reconstruction effort that will follow a Ukrainian victory, of which he is certain. Ustenko is scathing about Europe's response to Kyiv's challenge on oil and gas. By his estimate, Moscow banks about $1.4bn a day from oil and gas sales, with most of it coming from Europe. 'Imagine how many missiles and bombs you can buy for that kind of money,' he says. 'Some people in Europe still have extremely narrow thinking. They believe they can help us, that they're our great friends and indeed they are. But they do not understand that by supplying this money to Putin, they are funding his military machine. If Russians are committing war crimes, even genocide, whoever is supplying Russia with this bloody money is guilty of the same war crime.' Much of his frustration is directed at Germany, Europe's largest economy and among the most dependent on Russian oil and, in particular, gas. Foreign minister Annalena Baerbock promised last week that Berlin would end imports of Russian oil by the end of the year, phasing gas out later. Ustenko calls this schedule 'unacceptable'. But if, rather than Zelenskiy, he were advising German chancellor Olaf Scholz, would he really advocate cutting off the country's major source of domestic heating? He insists he would, adding that Scholz's predecessor, Angela Merkel, 'did everything possible to give this weapon to Putin'. 'He has weaponised his energy resources. Now it's time to show you're completely different. I wouldn't want my country to be facing national shame because we're not doing the right thing. Germany can survive without Russian oil.' An immediate oil embargo would, he says, mean short-term fuel price inflation, followed by a market correction as supplies from other nations kicked in. For gas, he admits the transition would be harder. In the meantime, he adds, payments to Russian gas suppliers should be held in escrow, to be unlocked when the war is over. This would choke off the Kremlin's revenue stream and provide a financial incentive to end the aggression. It troubles him that Europe's calculations are based on money and the prospect of thermostats turned down a few notches. 'Our guys are hiding underground in temperatures of 3C and you're talking about a few degrees colder in your house. In Ukraine we're talking about human life. You're setting human life against the temperature in your home, or the money.' He also has harsh words for those in the London business community who grease the wheels of international money flows for the Kremlin and the oligarchs who help prop up Putin. While grateful for Britain's military assistance, he thinks the government should, for instance, ban British insurers from covering Russian oil and gas consignments. 'Tankers lifting Russian oil have insurance from London. How many Ukrainians must be killed before that stops?' He invites London lawyers and bankers serving Kremlin-allied masters to imagine Russian soldiers coming to their houses and visiting atrocities on their families. 'Are you going to accept that? If yes, then do nothing for us. If you think it's immoral, act immediately.' He offers a similarly caustic assessment of the global commodities houses that continue to barter boatloads of Russian oil and gas. He has written to them all, begging them to stop. They, and the insurers, will face legal action in the future, he says. 'They know we're watching them and collecting this information. These companies should be judged. Maybe in a year, maybe in 10 years, but we are going to find these people.' Right now, Zelenskiy's adviser wants tougher economic sanctions. They could include shutting Russia out of all international payments, not just Swift, and measures to stop European boats collecting oil and gas from Russian ports to bring back home or transport to India or China. As well as helping Ukraine, such steps would be in European powers' own interests, he says. It would cut the costs of coping with floods of refugees and help them avoid becoming Putin's next target. 'You can't stop a monster. As soon as they're done with us they're coming to you. You have to be prepared.' While much of Ustenko's time is spent nursing the remnants of Ukraine's devastated economy, he says Zelenskiy asked him early on in the war to start planning ahead. The future is much in his thoughts: as well as an economist he is a family man, who used to enjoy walking in the woods around Kyiv and knows he will not do so for many years, because they are so heavily mined. 'The task the president has given us is to find all possible ways to rebuild the economy,' he says. 'We are going to win and we have to rebuild our country. We are talking about a huge amount of money.' Ukraine's defence and eventual reconstruction should, he says, be paid for with frozen Russian central bank funds and assets seized from sanctioned oligarchs. 'I'm talking about football clubs, I'm talking about nice apartments, houses and I'm talking about other properties in the UK. We have to implement big work in trying to identify more assets of Russian nomenklatura [a Soviet-era term for those elevated to positions of power]. MI6 is one of the best services in the world. Your financial service is one of the best in the world. They can do this.' Armed with funds, Ustenko would forge a new economic path for Ukraine, one that can lead only westwards. 'We're not going to trade with Russia probably for decades, so the only corridor for us now is Europe.' He is talking about logistical routes but also political ones - including European Union membership, via an expedited process. 'For us, the prospect of being an EU member is a huge motivation. It's like an extra star that appears in the dark sky. Under these circumstances everyone will win: Ukraine, Europe and our people.'", "4dde0b43f5fe0fe1ec0295a91538ee67d5cd2f178a77bd1268deb308": "In his late 70s, Albert Costa spent 10 days in a coma after a massive heart attack. When he woke up, one thing was clear: he would sell his life's collection of books. There was a catch, however. Costa's bookshop would not sell its products at their market value, but at a price he personally felt they were truly worth. Now 83, Costa trained first as an engineer and then as an anthropologist. He spent much of his life travelling around Africa and the Pacific acquiring artefacts for museums. He also became a compulsive book collector. What he did not want was for them to end up in a flea market where 'no one knows the value of what is in them and they sell them all for one euro'. The solution was to open Espiritus del Agua (water spirits) in Gracia, Barcelona, and stock it with his private collection of works on anthropology, art, philosophy and travel, as well as fiction. The tiny shop, crammed from floor to ceiling with books, takes its name from an exhibition about Inuit art that Costa helped organise in 2000 for Fundacio La Caixa, the cultural organisation linked to one of Spain's largest banks. 'I sell books but it's a business that barely pays the overheads,' he says. 'I enjoy it because it's a new career. But rather than sell them all to a library, I like people to come and look and then we can come to an agreement.' At one point a customer enters the shop and browses for about 10 minutes, then leaves. 'Has she gone?' asks Costa, who is profoundly deaf. 'Oh well, she's looked at the books. Books are for looking at too.' Pricing, he says, is a delicate issue. 'Lots of people have this idea that secondhand books have no value but I believe a secondhand book should be only a little cheaper than a new one and sometimes much more expensive. I try to arrive at a price somewhere in the middle. 'If people protest, I say, when you buy a secondhand car, you don't know if it's been well looked after and maintained. But you can see with a book that it's all there, the author's thoughts, the company that printed it.' He holds up a book. 'This is a masterpiece of anthropology; the author dedicated his life to this work, but this book was on sale for EUR9 (PS7.55). I'd ask EUR15 or EUR20. If people don't want to pay that, it's all the same to me. Unless it's a student and I know they're going to read it, then they can have it at any price.' Costa's collection - and there are plenty more books at home, he says - represents a lifetime of travel and curiosity and must be hard to part with. 'I know I can't leave my son with 10,000 books in the house,' he says. 'Of course, it hurts to sell them, but it's a painful obligation.'", "e1f8e34325df89e373066dc14b01950491d6998bfd906a80a934995e": "Kate and Gerry McCann are likely to take limited solace from Portuguese authorities designating a convicted German sex offender a formal suspect in the disappearance of their daughter, more than 14 years after police pointed a finger of suspicion at them. In their case, it took 11 months for the Portuguese police to lift their categorisation of the couple as arguidos - translated from Portuguese as 'named suspects' or 'formal suspects'. The initial police investigation in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann in May 2007 from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz was also shelved at that point. But by then, investigators had already made a string of potentially crucial, basic errors that included not only falsely suspecting the McCanns but also failing to seal off the scene at the family's Praia da Luz holiday apartment. Almost a decade and a half later, and following multiple suspects and desperate public appeals, it was a police search of an allotment in the German city of Hanover in the summer of 2020 that gave something of a different sense that there had finally been a breakthrough in the trans-national investigation. The excavation had come to an end by July of that year, but a name had already emerged in form of a convicted sex offender, Christian Bruckner, who had occupied the ground in the months following Madeline's disappearance. Now, the formal identification by Portuguese authorities of Bruckner as an arguido heightens levels of expectations again, even if an abundance of false leads over the years still gives cause for caution. The original Portuguese police investigation had also resulted in an Anglo-Portuguese man, Robert Murat, being taken for questioning and also being made an arguido. .  Murat was formally cleared of suspicion in 2008 and won more than PS500,000 in libel damages over defamatory articles connecting him with the child's disappearance. It would be January 2009 before the McCanns returned to Portugal, launching a fresh public appeal for information. One suspect emerged in the shape of a dying convicted paedophile, Raymond Hewlett, who said he was in the Algarve around the time of the child's disappearance but insisted he had an alibi. Another was an unnamed woman who private detectives hired by the McCanns said they wanted to speak to and who had reportedly been seen in Barcelona days after the girl's disappearance. In March 2010, a released file from the Portuguese police on potential sightings was described as 'gold dust' by a spokesperson for the family. But it, too, would lead to nothing before efforts were stepped up again the following year when the then prime minister, David Cameron, asked Scotland Yard to help the Portuguese authorities with their investigation. The Metropolitan police's involvement, known as Operation Grange, has continued to this day. It brought with it new 'persons of interest' and the identification of new cases where a lone intruder had broken into holiday apartments. Until the shift in focus to Germany in the summer of 2020, what appeared to be the most significant development was the search by British and Portuguese police of a patch of scrubland outside Praia da Luz in June 2014. It ultimately yielded nothing. The 10th anniversary of Madeleine's disappearance came and went in 2017, and four official suspects investigated by Scotland Yard were ruled out of the investigation - though a senior police chief said they were pursuing a 'significant line of inquiry'. On 4 June, against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic, the public identification of a German man serving time in prison as a new prime suspect came out of the blue. He was said to have been in the vicinity of the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz on the evening of 3 May 2007, and had a telephone conversation that ended just over an hour before the child went missing from the holiday apartment where she had been sleeping alone with her younger twin siblings as her parents dined at a nearby restaurant. Bruckner's name soon emerged. And while the development brought hope that the case of the child's disappearance may one day be solved, the German state prosecutor's office has said it has 'concrete evidence' that Madeleine is dead. Amid the latest developments, prosecutors in the Portuguese city of Faro did not publicly name the man but said in a statement he was identified as a suspect by German authorities at their request. A lawyer for Bruckner - who lived in the Algarve between 1995 and 2007 and burgled hotels and holiday flats, according to court documents seen by Reuters in 2020 - has said that his client has not been charged over the case. However, the potential timing is not lost on those familiar with the case given Portugal's 15-year statute of limitations for crimes with a maximum prison sentence of 10 years or more. Jim Gamble, the former head of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre who worked on the investigation into the child's disappearance, told BBC Breakfast on Friday morning: 'Well, this breakthrough could mean everything or it could mean nothing. 'My own gut feeling on it - from the moment the Germans began to release information two years ago - was that this was the best fit. You have proximity, you have opportunity, and you have a profile with regards to an offender that absolutely fits in a way that no others have. 'This is all positive. And from my own position, and I wouldn't be surprised if charges did follow.'", "f85d78d8dc89231f478549bda4c660b8c8e286222728935577c27156": "Twitter is poised to agree a sale to Elon Musk after he put together a $46.5bn (PS36.4bn) funding package to acquire the social media platform, according to reports. The company is close to agreeing to Musk's offer price of $54.20 a share, multiple reports said on Monday, and an announcement could be imminent on a deal valuing the business at $43bn.  The Twitter board had initially signalled its opposition to Musk by adopting a poison pill defence against any unwanted takeover approach. But it appears to have changed its mind after the world's richest man filed details of funding for his bid on Thursday, which was reportedly followed by meetings between the Tesla chief executive and Twitter shareholders. Musk, a prolific and often controversial user of Twitter, could not resist tweeting about the platform on Monday afternoon when he wrote: 'I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means.' Shares in Twitter were up 5.6% at $51.68 in early afternoon trading in New York. Musk flagged a potential hostile bid last week when he confirmed he was considering a tender offer for the shares in Twitter that he does not own, which would mean going around the company's board or, in investment jargon, going 'hostile'. A hostile bid remains an option for Musk if official talks fail, although any tender offer would face a significant obstacle in the poison pill defence, which is designed to dilute the shareholding of anyone who buys more than 15% of Twitter without the board's blessing. The company's decision to engage with Musk, taken earlier on Sunday, did not necessarily mean it would accept his $54.20 a share bid, sources close to the process told Reuters. It signified, however, that Twitter was exploring whether a sale to Musk was possible on attractive terms. Reuters added that Twitter also had concerns about deploying a poison pill stance if big shareholders back the bid. Musk owns 9.2% of Twitter, and Vanguard, a US asset management firm, is the largest shareholder with more than 10%. Competition experts have said that US antitrust law is unlikely to represent a problem for Musk, who is also chief executive of the rocket company SpaceX and owns the tunnelling firm the Boring Company but whose business interests do not compete with Twitter in any markets. Nonetheless, Reuters reported that Twitter wants to know more about any active investigations by regulators into Musk, including by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, that might pose a risk to the deal. Musk has more than 83 million followers and a penchant for shoot-from-the-hip tweeting, including a flurry of posts since his 9.2% shareholding first emerged this month that suggested changes to the platform. Some of the posts have been deleted but they included raising the possibility of an edit button for tweets - which Twitter confirmed it was considering - and removing adverts from the platform's premium service, Blue (which is available in the US and Australia but not the UK). However, Musk's main ambition for Twitter under his ownership appears to be shaping the company to his vision as a self-confessed 'free speech absolutist'. Musk said in a letter to the board this month that Twitter is 'the platform for free speech around the world' but cannot achieve this 'societal imperative' in its current form and 'needs to be transformed as a private company'. Representatives for Twitter and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.", "025dfdb120146d36b9d7f7e74f86213beebc8265c33504d635efca70": "Reuters has provided more detail on the decision by a New York judge to hold Donald Trump in contempt, ordering the former president to be fined $10,000 per day until he complies. Trump lost a bid to quash a subpoena from state attorney general Letitia James, then failed to produce all the documents by a court-ordered 3 March deadline, later extended to 31 March at his lawyers' request, the agency says. Justice Arthur Engoron ruled that a contempt finding was appropriate because of what the judge called 'repeated failures' to hand over materials and that it was not clear Trump had conducted a complete search for responsive documents. Although Trump was not in court, Judge Engoron addressed him directly:  James is investigating whether the Trump Organization, the former president's New York City-based family company, misstated the values of its real estate properties to obtain favorable loans and tax deductions. James has said her probe had found 'significant evidence' suggesting that for more than a decade the company's financial statements 'relied on misleading asset valuations and other misrepresentations to secure economic benefits.' The attorney general has questioned how the Trump Organization valued the Trump brand, as well as properties including golf clubs in New York and Scotland and Trump's own penthouse apartment in Midtown Manhattan's Trump Tower.  Read more: That's all for the US politics blog for today, a Monday almost entirely dominated by news about Donald Trump's legal troubles and developments in the inquiry into the 6 January insurrection that the former president incited.  Trump is facing a fine of $10,000 a day after a New York judge held him in contempt for failing to release documents to state attorney general Letitia James, who is probing his business dealings. And CNN revealed thousands of texts sent to and by Trump's former chief of staff Mark Meadows at and around the time of the Capitol riot. Developments in the Ukraine conflict are recorded in our 24-hour live blog here. And please join us again tomorrow, when the House of Representatives returns from its Easter break. Here's where else our day went: Jen Psaki was also questioned about today's meeting between Joe Biden and members of the Democratic Congressional Hispanic Caucus, who are concerned about the expected surge of migrants at the southern US border next month when the Trump-era Title 42 policy ends. Psaki noted the policy, which blocked refugees during the Covid-19 pandemic, was ending on health grounds, although Republican lawmakers visiting the border today are painting the predicted surge as an immigration failure by Biden. Psaki said the issue was a reminder that there was a need for comprehensive immigration reform: The homeland security Alejandro Mayorkas faces a series of congressional hearings later this week that will include discussions of Title 42, and which will undoubtedly feature some feisty questioning from Republicans.  Read more: The White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked about the breaking news of Elon Musk's reported Twitter deal early in her afternoon briefing, specifically the administration's thoughts about Donald Trump's possible return to the platform: Billionaire Elon Musk has reached an agreement to acquire Twitter for approximately $44 billion, the company said. The outspoken Tesla chief executive, the world's richest person, has said Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company in order to build trust with users and do better at serving what he calls the 'societal imperative' of free speech, the Associated Press reported. Twitter said it will become a privately held company after the sale is closed.Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal said in a tweet: Who wouldn't want Valerie Biden Owens in their corner? The first sister of the United States gives no inch in defending her big brother. Asked about Joe Biden's notorious gaffes, for example, she simply rejects the premise. 'He doesn't have gaffes,' she insists. 'He speaks the truth. Like, hello, surprise, I just said what was true!' At the end of a carefully crafted speech last month in Warsaw, Poland, the president ad libbed that Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, 'cannot remain in power'. To the world's media it was a howler implying regime change that upended weeks of diplomacy and sent aides scrambling. To Biden Owens, however, it was truth-telling after meeting refugee mothers and children. 'This is a man, you see what you get,' she says, with recognisable flintiness. 'His wife died. Two of his children died, one by a long death and one by a sudden death. And one almost from addiction. He was speaking from his heart. What kind of man [Putin] does this? That's the real Joe Biden. That was not a gaffe.' Biden Owens, 76, is talking about her newly published memoir. Growing Up Biden is a lucid account of a middle-class childhood remarkable only for its ordinariness, becoming the first woman in US history to run a presidential campaign, and helping 'Joey' emerge from personal and political disasters to reach his own mountaintop. It is also a moving portrait of sibling love. Joe is the oldest of four Biden children. Valerie was born three years later, followed by Jimmy and Frank. 'At an age when a lot of other older brothers pretended they didn't even know their sister, Joey took me everywhere with him,' she writes. 'When his friends would ask, 'Why did you bring a girl?' he answered, 'She's not a girl. She's my sister. If you want me around, she's going to be around, too.'' Read more: Following the New York judge's decision to hold Donald Trump in contempt in the attorney general's civil investigation, AG Letitia James said: 'Today, justice prevailed. For years, Donald Trump has tried to evade the law and stop our lawful investigation into him and his company's financial dealings. Today's ruling makes clear: No one is above the law.' James had asked for the contempt finding this month stating that Trump had not complied with a subpoena requiring him to produce documents and information. James' civil investigation has focused on whether the Trump Organization misstated the values of its real estate properties to obtain favorable loans and tax deductions. Earlier in April James said investigators had found 'significant evidence' of wrongdoing. In a court filing then, the New York attorney general said Trump failed to abide by his earlier agreement to comply 'in full' with her subpoena for documents and information by 31 March. On Monday, Judge Arthur Engoron, a New York state supreme court judge, agreed with James that Trump was in contempt of court. The contempt finding by the judge came despite a spirited argument by Alina Habba, Trump's attorney, who insisted repeatedly that she went to great lengths to comply with the subpoena, even traveling to Florida to ask Trump specifically whether he had in his possession any documents that would be responsive to the demand. 'The contempt motion is inappropriate and misleading,' she said. 'He complied ... There are no more documents left to produce by President Trump.' She also derided the James investigation as 'political' and 'truly a fishing expedition,' saying Trump and his companies had turned over more than six million documents and paperwork related to 103 Trump entities over an eight-year period. The Texas court of criminal appeals has issued a stay of execution for Melissa Lucio, the Mexican-American woman who was set to be judicially killed within 48 hours, ordering a lower court to consider new evidence of her innocence in the death of her two-year-old daughter Mariah. The court issued its order on Monday as the final clock was ticking on Lucio's transfer to the death chamber. She would have been the first Hispanic woman executed by Texas. As Wednesday's scheduled execution date grew closer, calls for a stay to give time for new scientific evidence of her innocence to be reviewed grew to fever pitch. The intensity of the outcry against her pending death rivaled that of the case of Troy Davis, the African American man executed by Georgia in 2011 despite serious doubts around his guilt. New evidence presented by Lucio's legal team in a 266-page petition suggested that the murder of her toddler daughter had never even happened. Medical and eye-witness evidence pointed towards Mariah having died after accidentally falling down a steep flight of stairs at Lucio's rental home. In a statement, Lucio thanked the court of criminal appeals for giving her the chance 'to live and prove my innocence. Mariah is in my heart today and always.' Sandra Babcock, one of Lucio's legal team and a professor at Cornell law school, said that the court's decision paved the way for a new trial which would allow a jury to hear evidence that was not presented at her original trial in 2008. Five of the 12 jury members from that trial have said that had they known what is now known about the case they would have decided differently. Babcock said: 'Melissa's life matters.As a survivor of childhood sexual abuse and intimate partner violence, and now locked away for these past 15 years, Melissa's voice and experiences have never been valued. The Court's decision signals its willingness to finally hear Melissa's side of the story.' Vanessa Potkin of the Innocence Project, who also represents Lucio, said: 'Medical evidence shows that Mariah's death was consistent with an accident. But for the State's use of false testimony, no juror would have voted to convict Melissa of capital murder because no murder occurred.' Jeff Leach, the Republican lawmaker who led the push for a delay of execution in the Texas House, greeted the news of the stay with delight, saying it would secure 'justice for Melissa and for Mariah and the entire Lucio family'. Earlier, Leach told the Guardian in an interview that the failings of the prosecution in Lucio's case had shaken his belief in the death penalty. He said her treatment had 'given me great pause and made me reconsider my stance on whether this is the way we want to do things in the state of Texas'. While we await Donald Trump's almost inevitable statement of fury over a New York judge's decision to hold him in contempt, and fine him $10,000 a day for failing to hand over financial documents to the state's attorney general, it's worth revisiting the extent of legal jeopardy the former president is in. A Guardian tally back in February found 19 separate legal actions against Trump at federal, state and local levels, ranging from his actions seeking to overturn the 2020 election he lost, to sexual misconduct and financial impropriety. Half allege improper conduct during his single-term presidency. As recently as last week he was ordered to pay his former aide Omarosa Manigault Newman more than $1.3m in legal fees, closing a case over her alleged violation of a non-disclosure agreement. My colleague Ed Pilkington examined Trump's legal woes in an article in February.

'I tested negative yesterday morning before testing positive today. I have mild symptoms and will be following public health guidelines,' O'Rourke said in a tweet that indicated he became infected on the campaign trail. O'Rourke, who narrowly failed to unseat Ted Cruz in their 2018 US Senate race, trails Abbott by a significant margin ahead of November's election, according to RealClearPolitics. A district court judge in Kansas has struck down a Republican-drawn congressional map that would likely make it harder for the only Democrat in the state's delegation to win reelection this year, according to the Associated Press. It was the first time a court has declared that the Kansas constitution prohibits political gerrymandering. The state is expected to appeal to the Kansas Supreme Court. Wyandotte county district judge Bill Klepper was scathing of Republicans' attempts to manipulate district boundaries to their advantage: The map sought to move some voters from the Democratic stronghold of Kansas City into a Republican-dominated district, thus weakening support for Democratic Representative Sharice Davids in her own district.  Critics argued that the map also diluted the political power of Black and Hispanic voters in the Kansas City area by splitting them up. The state rejected all of those allegations, but Klepper agreed and ordered lawmakers to draw up a new one. The Kansas case will be watched closely in Florida, where Republican governor Ron DeSantis last week signed a 'racist' congressional redistricting map that strips representation from Black voters. Numerous voters' rights groups immediately filed a lawsuit. Here's another dose of Monday opinion poll news, this time from Harvard Kennedy school's institute of politics, which finds young voters are losing confidence in the US political system. 'While 18 to 29-year-olds are on track to match 2018's record-breaking youth turnout in a midterm election this November and prefer Democratic control 55%-34%, there was a sharp increase in youth believing that 'political involvement rarely has tangible results' (36%), their vote 'doesn't make a difference' (42%), and agreement that 'politics today are no longer able to meet the challenges our country is facing' (56%)', the study found. And Joe Biden's job approval has dropped to 41% among young Americans, down five points from a similar poll in the fall of last year. According to Mark Gearan, director of the Harvard Kennedy school's institute of politics: Read the poll here. A fringe party in Canada says notorious right-wing American strategist Roger Stone, known for his political 'dirty tricks', will join its campaign ahead of an upcoming provincial election.  On Monday, the Ontario Party announced Stone, 69, would join as a 'senior strategic advisor' ahead of the province's expected June election.  The statement called Stone, who has worked on multiple US presidential campaigns, including Donald Trump's in 2016, a 'seasoned veteran of hard-nosed politics'. The release said Stone had been 'inspired' by the Canadian trucker protests, which paralyzed the nation's capital for nearly a month before it was broken up by police. Formed in 2018 and with little electoral success to date, the Ontario Party has been sharply critical of the province's public health measures during the coronavirus pandemic.  The party's leader, Derek Sloan, was expelled from the Conservative party in 2021 after he received a campaign donation from a white supremacist. Then-leader Erin O'Toole cited Sloan's pattern of 'destructive behaviour' and 'disrespect towards the Conservative team' as justification for removing him from the party.  In a tweet, the Ontario Party leader warned incumbent premier Doug Ford to 'watch out big guy'. It is unclear how much of a role the controversial American strategist will play in the province's election, as Ford looks to renew his legislative majority. In 2019, Stone was sentenced to 40 months in prison after attempting to sabotage a congressional investigation into former president Trump. He was subsequently pardoned by Trump.  Reuters has provided more detail on the decision by a New York judge to hold Donald Trump in contempt, ordering the former president to be fined $10,000 per day until he complies. Trump lost a bid to quash a subpoena from state attorney general Letitia James, then failed to produce all the documents by a court-ordered 3 March deadline, later extended to 31 March at his lawyers' request, the agency says.

Health officials have announced that a baby boy in North Waziristan, bordering Afghanistan, is paralysed after contracting polio. Dr Shahzad Baig, a coordinator with the Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme, confirmed the 'deeply saddening' case. 'This is the most critical time for the programme. The detection of this latest case of wild poliovirus is not unexpected,' Baig said. 'The Pakistan programme anticipated this risk and put in place contingency plans to enable a rapid response. It continues to intensify its efforts to eradicate all remaining residual transmission of any strain of poliovirus.' Pakistan's new prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, said he will hold an emergency meeting of the national polio taskforce. The case has created fear of a new outbreak in vulnerable areas around the Afghan border where vaccination campaigns are treated with suspicion and refusal is common. According to the World Health Organization, Pakistan is among one of only two countries, along with Afghanistan, still to eradicate the crippling polio virus, which has disabled and killed millions. Baig said: 'It is important to emphasise that the number of polio cases has been significantly reduced this year due to the unwavering commitment of health workers, support of communities, and various stakeholders. The programme continues to take pride in these efforts.'  The last case of paralysis as a result of polio in Pakistan was reported in January 2021. Afghanistan, in 2021, reported four polio cases, but low detection numbers mask a larger presence of the virus. Polio workers and their guards are frequently targeted in Pakistan, where Islamist militants and hardline clerics encourage beliefs that government vaccination is a cover to sterilise children and allow infiltration by western spies. Zainab Wazir, from North Waziristan, told the Guardian why she refused the vaccine for her two children: 'The US are using the so-called polio vaccination cover for their own interests, and objectives like espionage and injecting infertility into our children, which is our future and they are destroying them. 'Tribal people are forced to take these vaccinations from their own government's hands. It is made up of alcohol and pig fat to humiliate the Muslim population.' Militant groups in Pakistan have killed more than 100 healthcare workers and security staff since 2012. In northwest Pakistan in April 2019, more than 25,000 children were taken to hospital after the spread of unfounded rumours that a polio vaccine was causing sickness. Baig said: 'The programme has worked closely with the community to address vaccine refusals and hesitancy across Pakistan, particularly in the tribal areas. Community engagement practices have started with female religious support persons, who are offering awareness-raising sessions to women in the area. This is, so far, [is] running very successfully. 'In addition, the provision of health camps is making major ground in addressing vaccine refusal. This has decreased significantly over the last 18 months, and it is important to note that the current case is not a refusal.'

The CSI 300 index has closed down 4.94% today, its biggest one-day drop since February 2020, as Beijing's largest district begins mass-testing and Shanghai's lockdown enters its fourth week. The CSI 300, which tracks the top 300 companies traded in Shanghai and Shenzhen, tumbled by 198 points to close at 3,815 points, its lowest since May 2020. Traders are anticipating export disruption, and a hit to growth, as China tries to stamp out Covid-19 cases, as Jeffrey Halley of trading firm OANDA explains: A late PS: Wall Street has shrugged off its earlier losses, to close in the green. Despite concerns over China's lockdowns, the Dow Jones industrial average ended the day 0.7% higher at 34,049 points, up 238 points in the session, with technology and consumer firms among the gainers. Johnson & Johnson (+2.5%), Microsoft (+2.4%) and American Express (+2%) led the gainers, while communications group Verizon (-3.1%) and oil major Chevron (-2.1%) lagged. Tech stocks benefited from a drop in bond yields today, as investors anticipated a slower-than-hoped recovery. Twitter jumped around 5.6% after agreeing to Elon Musk's takeover offer. As CNBC points out, US stocks have already been on a poor run: Twitter has agreed to sell itself to Elon Musk, the world's richest man, in a $44bn (PS35bn) deal.  The deal puts the Tesla chief executive in charge of a company with 217 million users and an influential role in shaping the political and media agenda on both sides of the Atlantic. Twitter's initial reluctance to accept a transaction appeared to fade after Musk confirmed a funding package for the deal and shareholders warmed to it. Musk has signalled that Twitter will be overhauled under his leadership, including changes in content moderation, having described himself as a 'free speech absolutist'. The deal comes after a dramatic few weeks of speculation about Twitter's future, triggered by Musk's emergence as the platform's largest single shareholder on 4 April. He then declared a $43bn takeover bid on 14 April, which prompted Twitter's board to signal its displeasure at his overtures by adopting a so-called poison pill defence 24 hours later. However, the apparent opposition of Twitter's board faded after Musk drew up a $46.5bn funding package for the bid, including $21bn of his own money. According to reports, both shareholders and the Twitter board began to take the offer seriously once finance had been put in place. The deal is not expected to face serious scrutiny from US competition authorities because Musk's major business interests - an electric car company, the SpaceX rocket business and tunnelling firm the Boring Company - do not compete with Twitter. However, the deal is likely to draw comment from politicians and campaigning bodies given Twitter's influence as an information source and Musk's stance on free speech. Here's our news story on today's market jitters: Here's a round-up of today's main stories: That's probably all for today... Goodnight. GW Stock markets across Europe have closed with losses across the board. Fears that China's Covid-19 outbreaks will hit global growth sent the UK's FTSE 100 index down by 1.9% by the close of trading. The blue-chip index ended 141 points lower at 7,380, its lowest close in over five weeks and its biggest drop since early March.  Mining stocks led the fallers, after the tumble in commodity prices today, with Anglo American (-6.8%) followed by BP (-6.1%) and Glencore (-5.6%). The pan-European Stoxx 600 index lost 1.8%, hitting a one-month low. France's CAC 40 dropped by 2% as anxiety over the risk of lockdowns in China outweighed relief that Emmanuel Macron had won a second term as France's president. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, sums up the day: Economic slowdown fears have pulled Brent crude oil prices back below the $100 mark, for ther first time in a fortnight. Brent is now down over 6% today at $99.64 per barrel, on jitters that further China lockdowns would mean lower demand for energy. Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, says China is heading for the worst oil demand shock since early 2020. A senior European Central Bank policymaker has called for co-ordinated global action to regulate crypto-assets and protect consumers from danger. Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, compared crypto to the gold rush, where 'greed and lawlessness' saw 'the few exploited the dream of the many'. Panetta told an audience at Columbia University that crypto-assets are bringing about instability and insecurity - the exact opposite of what had been promised in the landmark 2008 white paper on bitcoin. In a no-holds-barred speech, Panetta says: Panetta also compared the crypto market to a Ponzi scheme, explaining: Here's the full speech: The U.S. economy expanded in March, but growth softened compared with the previous month, data shows. The Chicago Fed National Activity Index, which tracks economic activity and inflationary pressuures, decreased to 0.44 in March from a revised 0.54 in February. That suggests the US kept growing last month, but at a slower rate. Back in the UK's cost of living crisis, more than one in seven private tenants are paying over the odds to secure a rental property. Research shows that 15% of tenants paid more than the advertised rent to secure their property, due to desperation to get a roof over their heads or because of a shortage of options on the market. Wall Street has joined today's selloff, as investors fret about the prospect of more lockdowns in China and aggressive US interest rate hikes. The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by 270 points, or 0.8%, to 33,540 points, its lowest in over a month. That follows its worst session since early in the pandemic on Friday, when the Dow lost 981 points. Oil company Chevron (-2.6%) is the top faller on the Dow, with aerospace manufacturer Boeing (-2%) and construction equipment maker Caterpiller (-1.75%) also among the fallers.  The tech-focused Nasdaq has extended its recent selloff too, down another 0.9%, while the broad S&P 500 index is down 1%. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst with City Index and FOREX.com, says Covid worries are roiling financial markets.  Precious metals prices are sliding, hit by worries over China's economic outlook as Covid-19 infections spread. Palladium has taken the biggest knock. The metal, used in catalytic converters, is down 10%. Platinum, silver and gold have all lost over 2%. Optimism among UK manufacturers has fallen at its sharpest pace since the first coronavirus pandemic lockdown two years ago as firms struggle to cope with the fastest increase in their costs since 1975, according to the latest industry health check. With the war in Ukraine giving a fresh upward twist to the pressures on companies, the April industrial trends survey from the employers' organisation the CBI found firms cutting back on investment and planning to pass on higher costs to consumers. Manufacturing output and order books continued to grow despite the worsening inflationary backdrop but at a slower pace than in recent months, the CBI said. The survey showed the balance of firms whose costs increased - the number reporting a rise minus the number reporting a drop - stood at 87 percentage points in April. That was only slightly below the record of +88 points in July 1975, when UK inflation was running at more than 20%. Dearer raw materials and energy resulted in the fastest average price increases (+60 points) since 1979, with a further acceleration in price growth expected in the next three months. The CBI said the downward trend in optimism among manufacturers had continued. A year ago, when the UK was emerging from the early 2021 lockdown, firms upbeat about the outlook outweighed those gloomy by a balance of +38 percentage points. By October that had dropped to +2 points as supply chain shortages pushed up prices. The figure now stands at -34 points. More here: Almost 90% of British households reported an increase in their cost of living last month as they were hit by escalating fuel, food and borrowing costs, my colleague Phillip Inman reports. Heaping further pressure on Rishi Sunak to increase his support for those on low and middle incomes, the Office for National Statistics said a quarter of all those in its survey were struggling to pay their bills and 17% had turned to loans or borrowing on credit cards to make ends meet. Debt charities and anti-poverty campaigners said the figures, which cover the last two weeks of March, were a shocking reminder that this year households face the biggest cut in their living standards since the 1950s. Here's the full story on this morning's ONS report: Shares in Twitter have jumped in pre-market trading, on reports that the social media group is in the final stretch of negotiations about a sale to Elon Musk. Here's Reuters' latest: Twitter shares are up over 5% at $51.58 in pre-market trading, up from $48.93 on Friday night, approaching Musk's proposal. Global markets are continuing to show heavy losses today, as rising Covid-19 cases in China fuel worries about economic growth. In London, the FTSE 100 index is down 160 points, or 2%, at 7368 points, a five-week low, after China's stock market saw its biggest one-day drop in over two years. Anxiety about the economic consequences of China's Covid-19 outbreaks are driving the selloff, with mining group Anglo American now down 7.3% and Glencore off 6.5%.  BP are down 4.5%, with crude oil prices still down around 4% on forecasts that China's energy demand will be hit by lockdowns. Other internationally-focused firms are also among the major fallers in London, reflecting concerns over the global economy as the US Federal Reserve looks likely to hike US interest rates sharply this year. Fashion group Burberry has lost 4.5% and equipment rental group Ashtead is down almost 5%. Raffi Boyadjian, lead investment analyst at XM, says: Confidence among UK manufacturers has fallen at the fastest rate since the first Covid-19 lockdowns, as the Ukraine war and rising inflation bites. Business sentiment and export optimism both fell in April, at the sharpest rates since April 2020, as economic uncertainty and commodity prices both jumped. The balance between UK factories who were more upbeat about their business situation, rather than pessimistic, slumped to -34% in April from -9% in January, according to the CBI's first quarterly Industrial Trends Survey since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. That's the biggest drop in confidence since April 2020, in the first wave of the pandemic. Investment intentions for the year ahead were much weaker across the board in April compared to three months ago, suggesting that firms are cutting back. Companies also reported that growth in output and new orders slowed over the last quarter, with new orders expected to keep falling in the next quarter -- a sign that the economy is slowing. Cost pressures remained intense, with average costs growing at the fastest rate since July 1975 . Firms also hiked domestic prices at the fastest pace since October 1979, which will feed through to consumers as higher prices in the shops. The cost of raw materials was the most important factor behind expectations for cost growth in the next three months (80% of respondents said this was extremely important), followed by energy costs (59%), transport costs (41%) and labour costs (38%).

The Argentinian man, 39, had been flying his drone in Piazza Venezia when he lost control of the device and sent it crashing into the roof of Palazzo Venezia, a 15th-century building from where the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini delivered some of his most famous speeches. The drone was recovered by the building's security staff before being seized by police, who reported the tourist for failing to comply with a no-fly drone zone over the city, according to reports in the Italian media. People who want to film or take shots of the Italian capital from above with a drone must get permission and be registered with Enac, the national body for civil aviation. Piloting a drone in central Rome and the Vatican is completely out-of-bounds because of all the precious monuments. However, tourists appear to be oblivious to the rules. Last week, two Mexican tourists crashed their drone into the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The brother and sister faced police action for breaking no-fly rules around the Tuscan city's famous landmark. In 2020, a 40-year-old tourist from Poland crashed his drone inside the Colosseum despite having been warned that piloting the device inside the ancient amphitheatre was banned. In July last year, a 61-year-old man was charged with an 'attack against transport security' after flying his drone above Rome at an altitude of 2,000 metres. The man, who was a member of a Facebook page for drone fanatics, was reported after his device was seen by a professional pilot. Fortunately there have been no reports of damage to monuments due to the impact of crashing drones. Penalties imposed have not been reported either, but fines for violating drone rules range from EUR516 to EUR64,000. Italy celebrates Liberation Day on Monday, marking the 77th year since the country's liberation from German occupation and fascist rule. Mussolini made some of his most famous speeches from the balcony of Palazzo Venezia, including declaring war against Britain and France on 10 June 1940. The building now houses a museum.", "3f17d45354909e2eb84dc3b9d7428214d975a718d083a39a7d931541": "Amazon workers in New York will go to the polls again as labor activists push to unionize a second facility in the US following their surprise recent victory over the tech giant. About 1,500 eligible workers at an LDJ5 Amazon sorting center in Staten Island, New York, begin voting in a union election on Monday, in a process that will continue through 29 April. Ballot-counting starts on 2 May. Amazon has aggressively opposed unionization among its workforce, which totals about 1.1 million people in the US alone. The fight comes as workers at other major corporations including Starbucks are fighting to unionize. Amazon has spent millions hiring union avoidance consultants. Amazon Labor Union (ALU) organizers have alleged harassment and intimidation from management. The company is vigorously contesting its first loss and has accused ALU of using 'objectionable, coercive, and misleading behavior', to convince workers to support them. Among other objections, Amazon claims the vote should be overturned because ALU 'intentionally created hostile confrontations' and offered marijuana to workers in an 'impermissible grant of support' for workers' votes, according to filings obtained by the New York Times. The sorting center is right across the street from the JFK8 warehouse where workers won a historic first union election at Amazon in the US on 1 April. It is the second union election petition filed by the ALU, an independent group of current and former Amazon workers with no affiliation with established labor unions and led by the former Amazon worker Chris Smalls. Since the union's election win at JFK8, ALU has received inquiries from workers at dozens of Amazon facilities around the US and internationally about forming unions at their respective facilities and received over $300,000 in donations to the union's GoFundMe page. Ahead of the election, ALU hosted a rally featuring speeches from Senator Bernie Sanders and union leaders, including the AFA-CWA international president, Sara Nelson, and Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union.  ALU organizers who work at LDJ5 have said they experienced similar anti-union efforts by Amazon, and have filed multiple unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board. 'This employer has been engaging in sustained unlawful union busting. Amazon has violated the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) by forcing employees to attend captive audience meetings, disciplining organizers for protected union activities, and prohibiting the union from displaying its banner in the break rooms,' said Seth Goldstein, a pro bono attorney representing the ALU. The union has joined with the American Federation of Teachers and New York State United Teachers in filing a complaint with the New York state attorney general, Letitia James, alleging that Amazon's anti-union efforts are in violation of the provisions of the New York state Excelsior Jobs Program, and pushing for Amazon to pay back $400m in tax breaks they received through the program.", "a305bb954ec1b7ce8c62588f65e1cb8e260ccfd4ed73147bfff7eaf0": "Beijingers were flooding supermarkets to stock up on food on Monday, hoping to avoid Shanghai-style shortages in the case of a city-wide lockdown as the capital records a growing number of Covid infections. Authorities in Beijing have ordered 3.5 million residents and workers in the biggest district of Chaoyang to report for three coronavirus tests this week, after the area recorded 26 of Beijing's 47 symptomatic cases since Friday. On Monday, China reported 3,266 symptomatic cases and 20,454 asymptomatic cases. The majority were in Shanghai, where 19,455 were reported. Beijing reported 19 cases on Monday, including 14 symptomatic. 'The current outbreak in Beijing is spreading stealthily from sources that remained unknown yet and is developing rapidly,' a municipality official said on Sunday. More than a dozen residential buildings were put under lockdown in Chaoyang, an affluent downtown area home to embassies and international businesses. 'Chaoyang district is now the topmost focus for pandemic prevention,' said the city's Communist party head, Cai Qi, according to the New York Times. 'Important pandemic measures cannot be left waiting till the next day ... All at-risk sites and individuals involved in these cases must be checked that day.' In Beijing the streets were quieter than usual, and restaurants less busy. During the Monday lunch hour hundreds queued at testing sites across Chaoyang, but wait times were usually less than an hour. Chinese health authorities are hoping to avoid a repeat of events in Shanghai, which resisted going into lockdown, before imposing partial city closures and then eventually a total lockdown. Now in its fourth week, Shanghai's lockdown has resulted in major food shortages and delivery delays, in large part due to road closures and too few delivery drivers, leading to freight bottlenecks and widespread community discontent. In Beijing residents flocked to supermarkets to stock up on food. Many of the capital's fitness studios and gyms cancelled classes or closed. The city also imposed tight entry controls, with travellers required to have a negative Covid test from within 48 hours. Supermarket chains including Carrefour and Wumart said they had more than doubled inventories and extended opening hours on Sunday, while Meituan's grocery-focused e-commerce platform increased inventory and the number of staffers for sorting and delivery, according to the state-backed Beijing Daily. On Weibo one person said their father had gone to a Chaoyang supermarket in the morning, and crowds of people waited with trollies for trucks to unload. 'There have been so many epidemics in Beijing, and I have never seen such a situation. It [seems] that the failure of Shanghai's early epidemic prevention and supply has been a big blow to the confidence of the people.' On Twitter, Chinese state media worker Liu Xin said she was stocking up 'for the first time in two years' after the detection of some cases in her district. 'Beijing's turn. But we are ready,' she wrote alongside photos of empty supermarket shelves and fridges. 'Let the tough times come.' Photos and videos across social media showed empty shelves at some stores, as shoppers appeared to ignore assurances that Beijing would not suffer the same fate as Shanghai. The Global Times, the state-backed English-language tabloid, quoted Beijing officials saying the city had sufficient daily supplies and was trading as normal. It said the mass testing across Chaoyang would determine if further measures were needed, including lockdowns. The numbers recorded in Beijing are low by global standards, but China remains committed to a zero-Covid policy. The policy responses of lockdowns, mass testing and quarantine have been successful in containing outbreaks in the past, but are being challenged by the highly virulent Omicron strain. Authorities now emphasise achieving zero-Covid 'in a social setting', meaning no cases are found outside of the quarantine system. After apparent changes in the way they attribute deaths, authorities in Shanghai have begun reporting fatalities from the outbreak, including 51 on Sunday. However the true number of people who have died after getting Covid-19 is believed to be much higher, with widespread reports of uncounted fatalities in hospitals and nursing homes.", "a546902fdfeb216351151c2a66dfc3bdfdc5e5bad1e94f24cd9ea631": "A grandmother was among four people stabbed to death in a house in south London, a family member has said, after a man was arrested on suspicion of their murder. The Metropolitan police are investigating the deaths after police were called to a residential address on Delaford Road in Bermondsey at about 1.40am on Monday after reports of a disturbance. After forcing entry, they found four people inside - three women and a man - with stab injuries. A man aged in his late 20s, who was known to them, has been arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody. Venecia Reid, the niece of one of the women, told the Evening Standard that grandmother Dolet Hill, a former employee at Guy's and St Thomas' hospitals, was among the victims. Speaking of her aunt, Reid said: 'She was very loving, very kind, very generous. She worked very hard in this country to support her two girls and her two grandkids. She does not deserve this.' It has been reported that one of the victims was Hill's partner. Speaking to reporters, local police commander Colin Wingrove confirmed that the four deceased individuals were three women, thought to be in their mid-60s, 40s and 30s, and one man in his mid-60s. The arrested suspect is a man in his late 20s, he said. 'At this early stage, officers are not looking for any other person.' The four people were attended to by emergency services but all died from their wounds at the scene. Officers are contacting next of kin and postmortem examinations will be arranged shortly. It is thought all five people were known to each other. However, Wingrove was unable to say whether they were family members. He appealed to anyone with information on the 'deeply shocking incident' to contact the police, and added that support would be available for the local community. Pictures from the scene showed that part of the road was closed off with metal hoarding and a number of forensic tents had been put up. The arrested man was taken to a south London police station where he remains in custody while detectives investigate. Anne Birkett, 60, who lives near the property where the victims were found, said she was woken up by police sirens and a circling helicopter just before 2am. Birkett said: 'It's devastating - you hear all of this but you never assume it's going to be right on your own doorstep. I'm a foster carer and I've got children in my care, and now I've got to protect them now because of what's happened.' A resident of the adjacent road, Bramcote Grove, who did not want to be named, said: 'When I saw four ambulances - not one, not two, but four - I knew it was serious.' Neighbours who spoke to the Guardian shared their shock and said they believed it was an isolated incident. One resident of Bramcote Grove, Danny Smith, 39, said he heard screaming on and off for five minutes at about 1am. He has lived in the area for 20 years and is an acquaintance of the household in which the stabbings took place. He said he believed four people were living in the house, whom he described as 'such a nice family'. Smith said that although he had heard occasional police raids, he had never heard of an incident on this scale in the area. 'It's the worst thing that's ever happened here. It's not the nicest neighbourhood, but everybody knows each other,' he said. He added that he saw armed police officers arrive in the early hours of the morning. Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said the screams on Monday morning sounded like 'someone getting battered'. He added: 'It's a very barbaric act, it's tragic what happened there.' The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said: 'I am heartbroken that three women and a man were killed last night in a devastating incident at an address in Southwark. My thoughts are with the family and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this awful crime. I am in contact with the leadership of the Metropolitan police. 'An investigation is under way and one man has been arrested. I urge anyone who has information that could be relevant to contact the police immediately.' A spokesperson for London ambulance service said: 'We were called at 2.07am today to reports of an incident on Delaford Road, Bermondsey. 'We sent three ambulance crews, two fast response units, two incident response officers, two advanced paramedics and a team leader to the scene. Our team worked closely with colleagues from other emergency services. Sadly, despite the best efforts of our medics, four patients died at the scene.'

A report by the centre-right thinktank Onward, which counts the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, among its supporters, has found there is strong support for tackling the climate crisis among Tory voters despite attempts by some on the right of the party to campaign against the measures. A small group of about 20 Conservatives last year formed the Net Zero Scrutiny Group (NZSG), which has been campaigning against measures to tackle the climate emergency and trying to link net zero plans to the cost of living crisis. The group is linked to the Global Warming Policy Foundation thinktank, which has denied there is a climate crisis. Steve Baker, a leading member of the NZSG, recently shared a report denying the crisis. These efforts do not seem to have worked, as there is support among Conservative voters for the net zero target, according to a poll by Public First for Onward. It conducted two nationally representative polls on 15-23 February and 6-7 April, of 4,021 and 2,008 people respectively. It found nearly half (46%) of voters said they would be less likely to vote for a party that pledged to get rid of the net zero target. Only 15% said it would make them more likely to vote for such a party. Ditching net zero is unlikely to win back those 2019 Conservatives who say they no longer support the party; among this group, 51% say they would not vote for a party that got rid of the net zero target, while only 18% said they would vote for such a party. The report warns against complacency, pointing out: 'There is a noisy campaign on the right of British politics, including from Nigel Farage, for greater accountability over net zero policies.' It says there are concerns from the Treasury over the costs of net zero and that voters remember diesel cars and combi boilers they were told to buy by previous governments ended up being costly. While those campaigning against net zero measures claim they are speaking on behalf of the poorest in our society, saying they will be forced to be 'poorer, colder and eat insects' under climate action plans, there is strong support for climate measures among working-class voters. The report found working-class Tories were more supportive of investing in renewable energy and more optimistic about new jobs in manufacturing than affluent Tories.  The authors said: 'Any assumption that the Conservatives' working-class voters are particularly sceptical about the benefits of net zero would be completely unfounded, according to our data.' The Conservative MP Alexander Stafford, the vice-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on the environment, told the Guardian: 'Action on net zero is electorally popular - thats why all major parties included it in their 2019 manifestos. Recent events such as the cost of living crisis and Putin's invasion of Ukraine demonstrate that the need to push harder on net zero has never been greater. Any party who was to be seen as scaling back environmental ambition would not be thanked by voters. The Conservative party should continue to build on the work they have done to bring the country closer to net zero.'", "96e397f52ff98438d31ef4fe2b974f7c2301d94f9da7ecd3056d645a": "Clashes between rival groups in Sudan's Darfur killed at least 168 people on Sunday, an aid group has said, in the latest bout of deadly violence to hit the restive region. Darfur, which was ravaged by civil war that erupted in 2003, has seen a spike in deadly conflict since October last year triggered by disputes mainly over land, livestock and access to water and grazing. The latest fighting began on Friday in the Krink region of West Darfur, said Adam Regal, spokesman for the General Coordination for Refugees and Displaced in Darfur, an independent aid group. 'At least 168 people were killed on Sunday and 98 wounded,' said Regal, voicing fears that the death toll could rise. The violence broke out when armed tribesmen attacked villages of the non-Arab Massalit minority in retaliation for the killing of two tribesmen, the aid group said. At least eight people were killed on Friday, it added. On Sunday, a tribal leader from the Massalit minority described seeing multiple bodies in villages of the Krink region, which lies 80km (50 miles) from West Darfur's provincial capital, Geneina. Medics from the Central Committee of Sudan Doctors warned of 'catastrophic' health conditions in West Darfur, saying that several hospitals were attacked in the violence. The International Committee of the Red Cross called on authorities to ensure the safe arrival of the wounded to hospitals. The United Nations special representative, Volker Perthes, condemned the killings and called for an investigation. Images posted online on Sunday showed burning houses sending plumes of thick black smoke to the sky, while others showed round patches of scorched earth where huts had stood before they were set alight. Agence France-Presse could not independently verify the authenticity of the images. On Sunday, the aid group accused the Arab Janjaweed militiamen of orchestrating the latest attacks. The mainly Arab militia gained notoriety in the early 2000s for its role in the repression of an ethnic minority rebellion in Darfur. Many of its members have since been integrated into the feared paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, commanded by General Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, the de facto deputy leader of Sudan, according to rights groups. Regal said the militiamen had in recent weeks 'committed killings, burning, lootings, and torture without mercy'. The conflict that erupted in 2003 pitted ethnic minority rebels who complained of discrimination against the Arab-dominated government of then-president Omar al-Bashir. Bashir's government responded by unleashing the Janjaweed, mainly recruited from Arab pastoralist tribes, who were blamed for atrocities including murder, rape, looting and burning villages. The fighting killed 300,000 people and displaced 2.5 million, according to UN figures. The main conflict has subsided across much of Darfur but the region remains awash with weapons and deadly clashes often erupt mainly over access to pasture or water. Bashir was ousted in April 2019 following months-long mass protests against his rule. He remains wanted by the international criminal court over his role in the Darfur conflict. In recent months, scores of people have been killed and hundreds of houses torched in several bouts of violence in Darfur, according to the UN and medics. The latest violence has reflected a broader security breakdown in Darfur following last year's military coup led by army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, that derailed a transition to full civilian rule following Bashir's ouster.", "bd52c2f36e7b6b3fd1460327f025db880f9661b91804923dbfad9a2a": "", "929a52046dfbbfaaab897258b98e4035dc68c7d54c5de35a2e70cee5": "", "7957aa486e7f0a2afa9c41aeffb83ceb1f45d25ca007ed0a1ebe1330": "", "fa14f6b24a533f5f69946f41e15597ec7b00cc41891bba0a6065c283": "", "b869cc8dbfc7c734ddc001c71fdc549d8d3015a5b61beb9371068977": "", "7c67529258dc2c090dd8ac6615959cd432f7af7a50991a5be52cf8ae": "", "43f80b3e546e204d15971416cbfc81f6119e790e073f0252c5a84f20": "", "6ebe011a255be0ea15d71d1e2869557d80447974161d3b2c7549ef74": "Known as 'the tuber man of Kerala', Shaji NM has travelled throughout India over the past two decades, sometimes inspecting bushes in tribal villages, at other times studying the ground of forests closer to home among the green hills of Wayanad in Kerala. His one purpose, and what earned him his title, is to collect rare indigenous varieties of tuber crops. 'People call me crazy, but it's for the love of tubers that I do what I do,' says Shaji. 'I have developed an emotional relationship with the tuber. When we did not have anything to eat, we had tubers.' Shaji's 8,000 sq metre (2 acre) farm boasts a wide array of tubers, some on the verge of extinction and some that produce record-sized fruits. Better-known varieties such as yams, sweet potato, cassava, taro and Chinese potato also thrive there. Like many Keralites, Shaji's personal favourite is the dioscorea - he grows about 60 varieties on his farm - and he particularly loves white yams. At times, word of mouth helps him locate rare tubers, with Facebook and WhatsApp groups also updating him on potential discoveries. When he finds a new variety, he says: 'I consult the elders and farmers of the various tribal villages, and we try to name the tuber something closest to the tribal name.' As well as earning him his nickname, Shaji's work in conserving and popularising the tuber has been recognised with a number of awards at state and national level, including an India biodiversity award for the conservation of domesticated species in 2021. His love of tubers, which are used extensively in Indian cooking, began at a young age. While he was growing up, food was often scarce. 'Staples like wheat or rice were hard to get,' says Shaji. 'And the only thing that provided us with a constant supply of food was tubers, because they are locally available and grow easily.' When Shaji's grandparents moved from the low-lying area of Ernakulam in Kerala to the highlands of Wayanad in 1952, feasting on traditionally grown tubers was a way of life which Shaji continued. Shaji thinks tubers are not only essential as a food but also for their medicinal properties. 'We used to eat food as our medicine - now we eat medicine as our food,' he says. 'It must be the tubers that have kept my grandparents healthy even now at the age of 110.' Today, Shaji's prized collection consists of more than 200 varieties of wild and indigenous tuber crops. The day we spoke, he had just finished giving a tour of his farm to 50 students from Bengaluru. To him, knowledge should be easily accessible. 'I grow these crops on my land and then give the seeds to farmers and to anyone who wants them. In return, I encourage them to multiply the crops and to include them in their diet,' says Shaji, who calls himself a 'cultivator' rather than a farmer. But conserving some of the rarer tubers is not so easy as the climate heats up. Kerala is losing biodiversity as incessant and unseasonal rains wash away fertile fields. When, in 2018, Kerala received one of the heaviest recorded rainfalls in its history, Shaji's farm was under water for 15 days. 'The scientists told me that everything would be rotten, and I believed them. I thought it's OK to lose everything and start from the beginning as I did once,' he says. But to his - and the village's - surprise, 'everything started to sprout back after a month or so,' says Shaji. 'I have never used any chemical on my soil, ever. Maybe it's because my soil is so good that nature does not devastate my farm.' Researchers noted in a paper in 2018 that tuber crops 'are resilient to climate change due to their capacity to surge over the adverse conditions by becoming dormant and resuming tuber growth during favourable conditions, thereby bringing down the chances of crop failures'. This ability to tolerate changing climate conditions, say the researchers, makes the tuber 'very important for the food security and income of people in this region as well as in many parts of the country'. For Shaji though, farming is much more than just providing food. 'Agriculture should start first in our hearts and not in the earth,' he says.

Students hardly register the lustrous dust - laced with lead, chromium and other contaminants - that settles into the blacktop as they rush out the front gates. For generations of Jordan students, the mounds of scrap metal behind campus are a familiar sight. The high school opened in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Watts in 1923, while the plant, owned by S&W Atlas Iron & Metal Co has been there since 1949. 'Nobody really complained about it, because I guess we just kind of had to get used to it,' said Diana Salvador, who graduated from Jordan high in 2019. But she's horrified when she thinks back. 'We would sit outside, eating lunch while they were throwing scrap pieces around. And we were breathing that air - inhaling lead.' It's only in recent years that local authorities started to grow concerned - linking toxic contamination on school grounds to the piles of metal detritus next door. Lab testing in 2020 commissioned by the school district and state authorities found dangerous levels of lead - a neurotoxin - and other heavy metals in the school's softball field and inside classrooms. Test results reviewed by the Guardian revealed concentrations several times higher than what the US government considers safe for children. Now, two lawsuits could push Atlas out, and allow Jordan high students to breathe a bit easier. In 2020, the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) sued Atlas in federal court. Although the recycler denies responsibility for contamination on campus, blaming other possible sources, LAUSD contends that Atlas, and its barrage of metal projectiles and toxic emissions, is an imminent threat to the school. And last year, the city of Los Angeles filed suit against the recycler as well, alleging that Atlas is in violation of health and safety codes.  But in an industrial community where children have become inured to a daily deluge of pollution, residents are dubious that anything will change soon. Watts - a predominantly Black and Latino neighborhood in south LA - is built atop land steeped in industrial contamination and bordered by two congested freeways. Recycling plants, lumber yards, auto shops, fabricators and warehouses adjoin playgrounds and churches. Just east of Jordan high, the Alameda corridor, a 20-mile (32 km) freight expressway, vibrates with a noxious stream of rail and truck traffic flowing between the two busiest ports in the country. Here, the average life expectancy is 12 years shorter than it is in wealthier parts of Los Angeles - in part due to the pollution. According to California's office of environmental health hazard assessment, the area where Jordan high is located suffers environmental burdens - from dust, diesel fumes, toxic waste and water contamination - in the 99th percentile compared with the rest of the state. 'It is kind of evil to continue to add pollution to neighborhoods that are already struggling so much,' said Heaven Watson, a junior at Jordan. 'But it's like, what can you do? This is a low-income neighborhood.' Among her group of friends, she said, 'two out of three of us have somebody in our family with some type of condition due to pollution'. Fatima Iqbal-Zubair, a former teacher at Jordan high who is now running for state assembly on an environmental justice platform, said it crushed her to see how accustomed her students were to the signs plastered at school, and around the neighborhood, warning them to beware of contamination. 'I would literally tell them, 'No, this is not normal',' she said. 'This is not a normal way to live.' Across the country, low-income children of color are most likely to be exposed to harmful air pollution at school. Local leaders said that the Atlas facility is part of this legacy of environmental racism. In a community that is already contending with so many hazards, the Atlas recycling plant 'is like a big slap in the face', said Tea Vickers, an organizer with the Better Watts Initiative, a local environmental group. The facility is a half-block compound, heaped with piles of crushed up car parts, steel tubing and metallic detritus. The materials are dismantled to salvage copper, steel, aluminum and other metals that can be refined and reused in manufacturing. The business markets its service as a way for individuals and industries to reduce their carbon footprints, keep reusable metal out of landfills and preserve natural resources. Sourcing aluminum or copper from scratch results in far more carbon emissions than using recycled metals, but the recycling process can be messy and ultimately toxic. Teachers, students and school administrators said the facility's operations can be distracting - and dangerous. Watson said the noise from Atlas has, at times, drowned out her physics lectures. Salvador, who lives in the housing projects right next to Jordan high and Atlas, said that when she first moved to the area, she'd wake up to the noise each morning, panicking that there had been an earthquake. On occasion, the shards of scrap metal have zoomed on to the blacktop where students play pickup basketball, and where the high school's military training program runs afterschool drills. At the boundary between the school and Atlas metals, in the softball field, Watson said she has spotted nails and small pieces of broken glass. The school's field was renovated in 2020 but until this month, games were being held at opponents' schools, where the players could bat and field without having to brace for errant metal shards. A fence affixed with warning signs, cutting through the third baseline, recently came down after school officials cleaned the area and worked with Atlas to reduce the risk of projectiles. As an extra shield against projectiles, Atlas had erected a stack of shipping containers behind the wall that separates it from the school. But the school district countered that the improvised barrier made students less safe. 'What if they had toppled over?' said Carlos Torres, director of LAUSD's office of environmental health & safety. The most alarming problem remains lead-laced dust that drifts across campus, according to students, administrators and community members. Unsuspecting students might breathe in trace amounts as they shuffle through the school day, or drag some home on the frayed edges of their Y2K revival jeans. Teachers and school staff have described the dust as a 'purple shimmer' in court documents, and the school district alleges that it emanates from the heaps of shredded metals at Atlas. Lab testing has confirmed that the dust is as insidious as it appears. Testing commissioned by LAUSD, and reviewed by the Guardian, revealed lead concentrations up to 790 micrograms per square foot in dust samples taken from classroom floors - more than 75 times higher than what the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines as a hazardous threshold. The state's department of toxic substances control (DTSC) also found elevated lead and heavy metal concentrations in outdoor areas around the school. Soil and dirt samples collected from the softball field and near the batting cages contained lead concentrations of 400 parts per million (ppm) or higher, which the EPA considers a hazard. In dirt samples taken from Atlas' facility, DTSC found lead concentrations of up to 10,000 parts per million (ppm).  Lead-based paint - which the US banned for consumer use in 1978 - is a common source of contamination on older school campuses across the country. But at Jordan high, lead and other heavy metals including cadmium were discovered inside classrooms constructed in 2013 and in fields that had already been cleaned and renovated - leading the school district to link the contamination to Atlas' operations. Lead is especially toxic to children because it can affect the development of their brain and nervous system. Studies have found it can lead to cognitive and behavioral problems, hinder children's attention span and their ability to do well in school. Even small amounts of lead in a child's bloodstream can cause damage, said Martha Dina Arguello, the executive director of Physicians for Social Responsibility-LA. 'And it causes permanent damage, damage that children will carry throughout their entire lives.' Emissions from metal recycling plants can also add to particulate pollution from vehicle emissions and exacerbate respiratory conditions including asthma. Mary Ann Cortez, who lives a few blocks from the Atlas facility, said the dust that penetrates her carpets and clouds her windows terrifies her. Cortez's eldest daughter, who recently graduated from Jordan, has asthma, and her middle daughter is beginning to develop respiratory problems as well. 'We're in a community where it feels like you're incarcerated, where you have to live with all your doors closed and windows pulled because of the pollution,' she said. Atlas Metals has been involved in some form of litigation with the school district and the city for five years now, but it has been in conflict with the school for much longer. In 2002, a Navy shell that Atlas was dismantling exploded, launching a chunk of metal on to Jordan's campus. In the subsequent years, DTSC and the EPA ordered Atlas to clean up 1,400 cubic yards of soil and debris along its border with Jordan high, after the waste piles were found to contain hazardous levels of lead, zinc, chromium, arsenic and other contaminants. After decades of complaints, 'just the fact that we're having to have a conversation about air quality and soil samples and the noise in our classrooms is really disheartening', said Lucia Cerda, Jordan high school's principal. 'We shouldn't have to do so much advocacy just to make sure our students are safe.' Between 2017 and 2020, the school has spent more than $2.4m to test, treat and monitor contamination on campus. Portions of the campus have been cleaned and treated two or three times, said LAUSD's Torres. 'And they're continually getting recontaminated - it just really crushes me.' The two lawsuits are seeking damages from the recycler for violations of health and safety codes. Ultimately, said Torres, the school could come to a deal with Atlas, and help the recycler move to another location - away from the school. Atlas has argued the district's claim that the recycling facility is the source of contamination 'is factually groundless'. Matthew Weisenberg, who owns Atlas, noted that no sampling can directly link the dust at Jordan high with Atlas. In an industrial community such as Watts, there are several possible sources of particulate pollution and heavy metal contamination, he said. 'To blame Atlas for all the school's contamination problems ignores the current and past realities of this neighborhood,' Weisenberg said in a statement to the Guardian. The school has countered that even if laboratories cannot confirm the provenance of toxic dust, tests conducted by the DTSC have found elevated levels of the same heavy metal contaminants at both the Atlas facility and the school, with no known sources other than the metal recycler. And even if Atlas isn't the sole source of contamination in Watts, it's clear that the facility is a part of the problem, said Timothy Watkins, president of the Watts Labor Community Action Committee. It's a 'blight,' he said - a glaring, ugly reminder of the neighborhood's toxic legacy. 'We just shouldn't have a metal salvage operation next to a school. And we wouldn't have in Beverly Hills or Bel-Air,' he added. Atlas 'should get the hell out of Watts'. Relocating the plant will not be straightforward. Part of the problem is that few areas exist in California that are near enough to major transport corridors, but far enough from communities.  Moreover, many local residents are defensive of Atlas as a longtime family business, and one that has provided employment or income to many in the area. The company's owners prop up local causes, donate to local sports teams and sponsor community events. It's not uncommon to find people running errands in Atlas-branded T-shirts. Jacquelyn Badejo, director of the Watts Clean Air and Energy Committee, a local advocacy group, points out that Atlas, and the Weisenberg family, have been a part of Watts for decades. She sees the push to remove Atlas against a backdrop of change and redevelopment in Watts, which she and other long-time residents worry could displace Black and brown families. In recent years, a $1bn revitalization project has brought in new, sand-hued apartments and a 115,000 square-foot shopping center across from the high school - with plans to build more new housing underway. Badejo and others wonder if the city and school district are cleaning up the neighborhood under the auspices of environmental justice, while seeking to attract more private developers and wealthier, whiter residents. 'It's really just a part of gentrification,' she said. Watson, the Jordan high junior, said she vacillates between thinking of the mounds of scraps piled higher than the school's fence as an eyesore - and contending with what it means for her health. Fumes from the facility sometimes seep into the classrooms, and students jokingly call it the scent of 'sewer rat'. Watson said she usually avoids dwelling on what exactly she's breathing in, but more and more, her anger is creeping in. 'It's not an anger that's mad, but an anger that makes me want to do something,' she said. 'Something has to change.'", "87aded5db536df742452dbcc0f082659baefc740c53713c16a1187ee": "", "c93a568fed540af1f83847e0a68628d96feb73b78bddd74a21931921": ""}
