{"682444a59f6f77052273973f6764d118a778016289d47a32635c2657": "Neighbours boss Jason Herbison has shot down rumoured spoilers around Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan's return to the soap for its final ever episode later this summer.  The pair are reprising their roles as Charlene and Scott Robinson after 34 years as the Australian soap comes to an end in August, having filmed a scene for the episode in recent weeks.  Pop culture newsletter PopBitch previously claimed to have seen a leaked script from the finale, revealing the last scene would see Charlene and Scott pulling up onto Ramsay Street, before uttering the last line of the show: 'We're home.' However, Jason has insisted this is not the case, telling The Herald Sun: 'What I've read is not what happens which is great. It hasn't come out yet.' He continued: 'Seeing Kylie back as Charlene was quite a moment. Very special and I think for them too it was a real full circle for them.' While Jason would not reveal any further details, he described their homecoming as 'wonderful' and 'emotional'. Kylie recently revealed that reprising the role of Charlene stirred up lots of emotions.  'For so long I was like 'well maybe, hmm, I don't know if that makes any sense,'' Kylie said in an interview with Australian show Today. 'But I'm still in touch with Jason [Donovan] and Guy [Pearce] and Jason said 'this could be a nice opportunity to buckle the buckle' as an ex-boyfriend of mine used to say, or to circle the circle and say thank you.' She continued: 'It was lovely and emotional. Driving into Ramsay Street was quite something. 'Firstly where has all that time gone? Secondly everything looks exactly the same. Thirdly, Scott, Charlene, Jayne, Harold, it all just came flooding back. 'There was a lot of talking about memories and going back in time.' Neighbours boss Jason Herbison previously said Kylie and Jason 'needed very little persuading at all' to reprise their soap roles for the final episode.  'They both appreciate the show and the special role that it has played in their careers,' he told Inside Soap. 'It's a lovely show of respect to Neighbours, and I was thrilled when they said yes. It didn't feel right to end the show without them.' Neighbours will air its final episode in both the UK and Australia on 1 August, with a host of other characters from across its 37 years also returning for its send off. They include actors Ian Smith (Harold Bishop), Peter O'Brien (Shane Ramsay), Mark Little (Joe Mangel), Daniel MacPherson (Joel Samuels) and Natalie Bassingthwaighte (Izzy Hoyland). Earlier this year, it was revealed the future of the show was in jeopardy after UK broadcaster Channel 5 announced it would stop airing Neighbours from this summer. After the search for a new UK broadcast partner proved unsuccessful, it was confirmed the show would come to an end altogether, with bosses promising to 'end the show on an incredible high'.", "2f7821ff25845e5cd7c615618b5d2a3d38663ccabcc272081507b1cf": "We all know the basic wedding etiquette rules. Don't wear white unless specifically asked to. Don't choose someone else's special day as the moment to propose to your partner. Don't ignore your table assignment. But there are some less obvious ways guests might be rude at a wedding and not realise it. We asked a few etiquette experts to share some of the most common faux pas they've observed.  Read on for 12 rude behaviours to avoid at a wedding - along with expert advice for getting things right in the etiquette department.  Monopolising the couple's time The newly married couple obviously wants to spend time with their wedding guests, but if they were to properly catch up with every single person, there would be no time for dining, dancing, cutting the cake or anything else. Guests should be mindful of this. 'The bride and groom are going to make their way around the reception floor and while you want to wish them congratulations, you don't want to monopolise their time,' says Diane Gottsman, an etiquette expert, author of Modern Etiquette for a Better Life and founder of The Protocol School of Texas. 'A few minutes is all that is necessary. This is not the time to get into a lengthy conversation.' Take a moment to wish the happy couple all the best on their big day and then let them carry on with the festivities.  Making a spectacle 'One would hope it would go without saying, but the attention should be on the couple,' says Jodi R.R. Smith, president of Mannersmith Etiquette Consulting. 'Guests should refrain from screaming, fighting, being overly intoxicated, or sharing private information about the couple during this happy occasion.' It's great to get in the celebratory spirit at a wedding, but take care that you don't cross the line into making a spectacle.  'There's sometimes that guest who tries to upstage the couple by showing off on the dance floor, so then everyone remembers the person who stole the spotlight from the bride and groom,' says Jacqueline Whitmore, an etiquette expert and founder of The Protocol School of Palm Beach. 'Don't be that person.' Taking flowers It's not uncommon for wedding guests to go home with a beautiful flower arrangement from the reception or ceremony. But make sure you only do this with express permission from the newlyweds, wedding coordinator or other trustworthy source.  'Don't take the flowers unless they're offered,' Whitmore says. 'Maybe the couple wants to donate the flowers to charity, or maybe they want to take them home.' Requesting songs Again, unless you're encouraged to do this, don't go up to the band or DJ and request a song. And if they say no, don't get pushy.  'The couple is likely to have a playlist or pre-selected songs,' says etiquette expert Juliet Mitchell, also known as Ms. J. 'In this case, the DJ might tell the person the song list has been pre-set. End of story.' Oversharing 'Along the line of 'making a spectacle,' there are a surprising number of wedding guests (school friends or vengeful relatives) who choose wedding celebrations to divulge past missteps, true parentage, or embarrassing romantic histories of the wedding couple,' Smith says. 'This is not the time or place. If it is not already public knowledge, keep your juicy gossip tidbits to yourself.' Whether you're giving a speech or regaling the people at your table with stories about the couple, be mindful of the content you choose to include.  Failing to RSVP 'If someone is kind enough to invite you to their wedding, do take the time to respond,' Smith says. 'Adding to their to-do list and forcing the hosts to chase you down is rather rude.' Similarly, make sure you only RSVP for the people invited, ie, don't write in a guest's name if you didn't get a plus-one. Don't show up at the wedding with extra people either.  'Some people bring extra guests, in addition to their plus-one,' Mitchell says. 'But where are you going to put these other guests? It's irritating.' Taking photos during the ceremony Our phones can take great photos these days, but remember the couple has most likely hired a professional photographer to document this occasion.  'When an announcement is made not to take photos of the ceremony and people do it anyway, that is very rude,' Mitchell says. Even if there's no announcement or request in the program, it's best to put your phone away during the ceremony. Or if you simply must take a photo, try to be quick and subtle about it. Don't lean into the aisle and block the photographer's or videographer's perfect shot with your phone.  And whatever you do, make sure your phone won't go off during the ceremony. 'You don't want your text notification or phone ringer interrupting the couple's vows or other poignant moment in the service,' says Anne Chertoff of Beaumont Etiquette.  Telling the couple what's wrong Like all events, weddings have hiccups. When you notice something is amiss, however, don't march up to the newlyweds to point it out.  'Instead of adding stress to the couple, or their parents, on the big day, notify a member of their wedding planning team or catering staff if there's an issue that needs to be addressed,' Chertoff says. Drinking too much Just because there's an open bar doesn't mean you need to take full advantage and order endless drinks. 'Refrain from drinking excessively,' Mitchell advises.  Whitmore similarly cautioned against getting too inebriated, which can often lead to making a spectacle or staying at the venue later than you should.  'You're supposed to be a gracious guest, be there in support of the couple and have a good time without going too far,' she says.  Skipping or arriving late to the ceremony Resist the urge to skip the ceremony, even if you expect it might be long or boring.  'Being a witness of the wedding vows is the important part,' she says. 'To just show up for the party is in poor taste.' Furthermore, be sure to show up to the venue on time. You don't want to be awkwardly walking in with the bridal party procession.  'Even if it means mulling in the parking lot or sitting bored in the pews, guests should make it their mission to arrive at the venue well in advance of the wedding couple,' Smith says.  Of course, unexpected delays happen, so in these unavoidable instances, just make a subtle entrance.  'If you are running late, try to enter the ceremony as quietly as possible and sit in the back as not to interrupt the service,' Chertoff says.  Taking a to-go plate Even if you see leftovers, Mitchell advises against asking the catering staff for a to-go plate. As with flowers, you don't want to take anything unless you get the go-ahead from the couple or other people with authority at the event.  'I have noticed of late that the bride and groom may have 'to-go' containers fixed and prepared to take so as not to waste food,' Mitchell says. 'But don't ask for a to-go plate, regardless of how casual the wedding is.' Not showing up 'Saying that you will attend and then skipping out is even worse than not RSVP-ing,' Smith says. 'The hosts have planned for you to be there, included you in the seating charts and catering counts. Your absence creates holes in the affair.' If you have a last-minute emergency and can't attend, try your best to tell someone who will be at the event so that they can inform the coordinators.  'Instead of calling the newlyweds-to-be, reach out to one of their parents to let them know and send your best wishes as well,' Chertoff recommends.

The former couple welcomed son Bear in 2017 before splitting the following year after more than two years together.  Liam was asked about becoming a father for the first time during an interview on Logan Paul's podcast Impaulsive. 'To be honest with you, it ruined a relationship at that point - but for all the right reasons,' he said of having Bear.  'I was so excited for him to be born that I was actually worried if I wouldn't love him enough.' Liam also opened up about Bear's traumatic birth, saying: '[Cheryl] haemorrhaged quite badly giving birth so she was asleep for the first day. It was me and a baby in the room and I had to take care of it.' He went on to call Cheryl the 'best mum in the world', adding: 'I couldn't ask for someone better. He is all she cares about and I couldn't ask for more.' Liam and Cheryl have both regularly spoken of how they have remained on great terms following the end of their relationship.  She told The Sun in 2019: 'I'm actually really happy that we can be the way we are. We love and care about each other a lot and we share a child. It's really important that we're able to have a very healthy good relationship.' She added: 'We're going to be in each other's lives forever so we've got to figure it out and be grown-up about it.'

So goes the Chloe x Halle song, Do It. And those lyrics signify just how normalised wig-wearing is for Black women. Growing up it was normal to see your mum, aunts and even grandmas wearing one. But the state of wigs have evolved a lot since they started wearing them.  I was 17 when I first ventured into the world of wigs and these were the days of closures. A closure is your bog-standard wig that usually features clips or an elastic band to ensure it stays in place all day. In fact, they're perfect for everyday use, because they're so easy to put on and take off. Now we also have the frontal wig, which has really taken off in the past couple of years. When Chloe and Halle sing, 'Make sure you can't see no lace', they are referring to the lace on a frontal wig. A frontal differs from a closure wig as it's typically glued down to your hairline so it looks more like your own hair. As Martha O explains on the Natural Girl Wigs blog: 'One way to identify frontals is that they are used to recreate the hairline from ear to ear, while closures are used to recreate the natural parting of the hairline.' Frontal wigs have grown in popularity, especially online. But head to TikTok and you'll see more and more Black women who are tiring of their wigs, too. This sentiment isn't part of the natural hair movement per se - many Black women still enjoy wearing fake hair - but we want to explore different options. Options such as tape-ins, pony-tails and natural hair extensions. The kind of options that have been available to white women for much longer.  This is something that Tendai Moyo and Ugo Agbai, co-founders of Ruka Hair, have also observed. Ruka is a Black-owned hair business that aims to provide Black women with hair extensions in different textures and formats. As well as selling online, it now has a physical shop in Westfield Stratford City and also works with a network of 'co-creators' (in its lingo) who test out products. 'What we've noticed is Black women having less attachment to a particular style. We've seen more people experimenting with their own hair in various formats like ponytails and clip-ins,' Moyo tells HuffPost UK. She continues: 'One of the things a co-creator said in our community interview last year is that, historically, white women can go to a salon and say, 'I want longer hair that looks exactly like mine.' But, historically speaking, Black women haven't been able to do that.' That more Black women are downing their wigs is due to two Cs, she says: compromise (or not wanting to) and choice (the availability of alternatives). 'Three years ago, white women were using things like micro-links. This option wasn't a thought for Black women then, because it didn't exist in our texture.' Agbai also sees the trend for wig-wearing waning. 'I think with wigs, especially with frontals, it was something that you only saw in the theatre, or only saw celebrity stylists doing. Then it became extremely accessible and prominent. Now I feel like people are experimenting with other styles,' she tells me. Wider choice is certainly a factor, but let's not understate that the maintenance of frontals can be tedious. Wearing a frontal regularly requires a lot of time and effort. You have to glue the wig (which can take ages), then straighten it, apply a lace tint to make the wig look natural. Sure, you get used to it, but it's not fun.  As the Ruka website highlights, Black women spend six times as much as their white counterparts on haircare products and service. But this could be beginning to change. 'I've seen Black women accept the fact that their hair doesn't have to take a ridiculously long time,' Moyo says. 'Especially since frontals are usually done by professionals, if you do it by yourself you're not always doing it correctly, which causes more damage and time needed. I've seen more Black women finding styles that are less time consuming.' Agbai agrees and suggests that it's liberating many of us from some long-held habits, in some cases inherited. 'All of the language we've been socialised to use around our hair has influenced this,' she says. 'We think our hair should take a long time, that it can laborious to do our hair. I'm excited to see that shift and see Black women really look for quicker solutions.' The phrase 'where's the lace?' is used all too often in reference to frontal wigs. There's an obsession with making frontals look exactly like the hair on your head when a lot of the time, they just don't. This pressure for wig perfection has made some Black women consider other options. This is the case for Akua Ntiamoah, 26, a civil servant from Essex, who says she didn't enjoy wearing wigs as her hair never looked like what she saw online. 'I felt like i was forcing it. Maybe it's because I saw girls on Instagram wearing them, but when I put a frontal on myself I didn't look like those other girls,' she says. 'Black girls always say, 'the lace is invisible', but I can see it in real life.' She stopped wearings wigs two years ago. 'I was tired of my wigs not looking natural, so I cut my hair. I wore wigs from time to time, but I still didn't look right so now I just wear my hair out in a pony.' She says she also enjoys braids. Moyo and Agbai have received positive feedback about Roka's ponytails that putting them on doesn't require much work for the wearer. As they tell me: 'We'd get women saying: 'We don't have to put much gel in our, we can just attach the ponytail and go.' That is the best thing!' While wigs are often seen as a great protective style, wearing them too often can also damage your hair. For Joy Olugboyega, 25, a photographer and director from London, wearing wigs ruined her hairline - so she doesn't. 'I stopped wearing wigs in 2019. Haven't worn a wig since,' she says. 'My relationship with wigs was pretty much on and off. I hated what it was doing to my hairline but at the same time appreciated the convenience.' And now she's made the break, Olugboyega is reclaiming more than her hair. 'I realised I looked way better with my natural hair and Afrocentric hairstyles like fulani braids, faux locs, feed-ins. Not only do I look better, but I feel better too, like a queen,' she says. 'I just feel more like I'm more myself when it comes to how I present. It's the truest representation of me and where I come from.", "ebb63ef54f4f5842215732a03f019820ef877f43835166d233ea1f91": "Kim Kardashian will apparently do whatever it takes to look younger. 'I'll try anything,' the beauty and reality TV mogul told The New York Times in a recent interview about her new skin care line.  'If you told me that I literally had to eat poop every single day and I would look younger, I might. I just might.' The new line, SKKN by Kim, is a nine-product skin routine mirroring her own elaborate regimen: cleanser, toner, exfoliator, hyaluronic acid serum, vitamin C serum, face cream, eye cream, oil drops and night oil. The brand launches next month and joins her existing makeup and shapewear lines, KKW Beauty and Skims. The nine items come to an eye-popping total of $630, which Kim told the Times was necessary in order to include the ingredients she wanted. She said she uses the products on her neck and decolletage all the way 'down to my nipples.' The Times clarified that, as yet, 'excrement is not one of the ingredients in Ms. Kardashian's new skin care line'.", "0b18aa2a8c60596be624f67c4286330ea255ac92caff5d0dba225e11": " You're reading First Thing, the HuffPost UK series helping to make your mornings happier and healthier.  Getting enough sleep is critical for physical and emotional well-being, but so many people fall short. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that a whopping one in three Americans don't get enough sleep on a regular basis. (For reference: adults should be aiming for at least seven hours.) Of course, many factors go into a person's ability to get sufficient rest, from work and family schedules to sleep hygiene.  With that in mind, here are five common mistakes a lot of people make in the morning that affect their ability to fall asleep - and stay asleep - later on: 1. You're drinking too much caffeine Obvious? Sure. But drinking too much caffeine in the morning can throw your entire sleep routine off track.  In general, most healthy adults can safely have up to 400mg of caffeine a day. That's the equivalent of roughly four cups of brewed coffee or two energy drinks, if that's your thing. Remember, though: caffeine levels in energy drinks can vary widely, and there are serious concerns about their potential impact on the body. The effects from caffeine generally kick in within 15 minutes and peak about an hour later. 'Six hours after caffeine is consumed, half of it is still in your body,' according to the Cleveland Clinic. 'It can take up to 10 hours to completely clear caffeine from your bloodstream.' That means you can absolutely have a few cups of coffee in the morning and still be feeling them by dinnertime. Also, keep in mind that some people are particularly sensitive to caffeine. So try cutting back for a bit to see how that affects your ability to get sufficient ZZZs.  2. You're waking up at totally different times every day Sleeping in when you can is glorious, yes. But it can also take a toll on your broader sleep patterns. Many sleep experts suggest that people set a standard wake time and stick with it to the best of their ability, even on the weekends.  Why? If you sleep for a few extra hours on a Sunday, for example, you might not be tired again until much later than usual - which means your bedtime is thrown off and you're likely to be pretty darn tired when you wake up early for work on Monday. An irregular sleep schedule can also increase your risk of what experts call 'social jet lag' - basically, the discrepancy between your body's natural sleep schedule (i.e., circadian rhythm) and your social schedule, which throws off the midpoint of your sleep and has been linked to health issues such as increased inflammation and higher risk of depression. On the other hand, there can be benefits to catching up on sleep during the weekends, especially if you have a big sleep debt. To the extent it's possible, however, try not to make it a regular thing. 3. You're not exposing yourself to natural light Sleep is governed by our circadian rhythms (which also influence everything from hormone regulation to body temperature). And the sun's cycle has a huge impact on those rhythms day to day. Your body's circadian clock is most sensitive to light starting about two hours before your usual bedtime and lasting throughout the night up until about one hour before your usual wake time, per the CDC. 'Exposure to light during these times will affect when your body naturally gets sleepy and is ready to fall asleep,' the CDC says. What all of this means is that exposing yourself to plenty of bright light in the morning can help shift your bedtime earlier; by the evening, you're more likely to be sleepy and primed for rest.  4. You're not making a to-do list Creating a to-do list is one of the most powerful things you can do to stay on track throughout the day. It can also be an effective way to combat anxiety that often creeps up at bedtime and makes it hard to fall asleep. Not all to-do lists are created equal, though. First and foremost, it's a good idea to write it down. 'When you try to manage your to-do list in your head, you're likely to forget items,' HuffPost senior reporter Kelsey Borresen previously wrote. 'Jotting it down on paper (or digitally in your Notes or other mobile app, if you prefer) gives you something concrete to refer to when your brain feels like mush.' Also, make sure it's realistic. Try to focus on three to five things you can actually accomplish, experts say. It's a plan, not a wish list.  5. You're glued to your phone Checking your phone immediately after waking means you're letting someone else dictate what's on your mind first thing. And that can set the tone for the rest of the day - right up until your bedtime. 'If we wake up and we check our phone and there's an email from our boss that says, 'we need to talk,' or there's an email from a client who's like, 'Hey, can I call you later?' we can go straight from our slumber into panic mode, where your heart is racing,' Susie Moore, a life coach and author of 'Let It Be Easy: Simple Ways To Stop Stressing And Start Living,' previously told HuffPost.  At that point, it can be a lot more difficult to return to a calm 'intentional' state, Moore said, which can have ripple effects. So do yourself a favor and set the tone for the day by using an alarm clock rather than relying on your phone to wake you up. And try your best to make sure the time when you wake up and before you go to bed is phone-free.

Sandberg broke the news shortly before the close of trading on Wednesday, after which shares in the company that made her a billionaire fell sharply. In a lengthy Facebook post, Sandberg reflected in broad strokes on her 14 years at the company and how much it, and the world at large, have changed. 'The debate around social media has changed beyond recognition since those early days,' she wrote. 'To say it hasn't always been easy is an understatement.' Sandberg said she plans to leave the company this fall and will remain on the company's board of directors, but didn't describe her post-Meta plans in great detail.  In a separate post, CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged Sandberg's move as 'the end of an era' while thanking her for essentially building Facebook's business operations from scratch.  The move signals a massive internal power shift at Meta. As Zuckerberg's top lieutenant dating back to 2008, Sandberg oversaw a significant portion of the company's sprawling - and scandal-prone - daily operations. That includes when Cambridge Analytica, which had ties to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, improperly obtained and used the personal information of as many as 87 million users. And the time Facebook hired Definers Public Affairs, a Republican opposition research firm, to smear billionaire philanthropist and frequent Facebook critic George Soros. And the time Sandberg denied the violent Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol could have been 'largely organized' on Facebook -- only to have leaked internal documents completely undercut that narrative.  Sandberg's departure coincides with Meta seeking to reposition itself as a pioneer of what Zuckerberg describes as the 'metaverse,' a nascent and somewhat ill-defined virtual reality push. (Critics argue that the rebrand has more to do with rehabbing the company's well-earned and terrible public image.)  To that end, the new name will become official on June 9, when its stock ticker is scheduled to switch over from 'FB' to 'META.'", "6dcd5c433f594b168b3f660161e6d331ca2f998085d5eb5e1ca9a6af": "Damian Lewis has said that he and his late wife Helen McCrory are both 'thrilled' after he was made a CBE.  The actor, who is best known for his roles in the likes of Band Of Brothers, Homeland and Wolf Hall, has been honoured in the Queen's Birthday Honours List for his services to drama and charity. His wife Helen, who starred in Peaky Blinders and the Harry Potter films, died in April 2021 aged 52 following a battle with cancer. During the coronavirus lockdowns, Damian and Helen supported Feed NHS, a fundraiser to give food from high street restaurants to NHS staff and by April 2020 they had raised around PS1 million for the charity. Speaking of his honour, Damian told the PA news agency: 'What a great honour to be awarded the CBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours List for services to drama and for the charity work that I have carried out over the years and during the pandemic with my late wife, Helen McCrory. 'Thank you very much. She and I are both thrilled.' Damian was one of many famous faces honoured in the list.

Priti Patel, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nadine Dorries have all staged public interventions to gather support behind the prime minister. Other allies have accused the MPs trying to topple Johnson of being 'self-indulgent, narcissistic and contemptuous'. It comes after more than 40 Tory MPs publicly questioned Johnson's position and dozens admitted submitting letters of no confidence. Westminster insiders predict the prime minister could face a vote on his leadership as early as next week. Cabinet ministers on the offensive include the home secretary who told Tory plotters to 'forget it'. Patel told the Daily Mail: 'Writing letters is a sideshow, quite frankly, rather than focusing on the real challenges that we have to find solutions to.' Meanwhile, Brexit opportunities minister Rees-Mogg claimed the PM was an 'enormous electoral asset' and added: 'The idea that a change of leader would help the Conservatives is for the birds. It would be the most divisive thing that the party could do. 'It's an exceptionally silly thing to want to try and open the door to Sir Keir Starmer assuming he manages to survive.' Johnson loyalist and culture secretary Nadine Dorries told the BBC there was a campaign behind the scenes to remove the PM for 'individual reasons to do with personal ambition'. An anonymous ally in The Times went one step further, saying: 'Would it not be the most self-indulgent, narcissistic and contemptuous thing to decide that now is the time for another three months of Conservative navel-gazing?' Meanwhile, Johnson has reportedly delayed plans for a summer cabinet reshuffle as he battles the backbench revolt, according to The Telegraph.  The PM was expected to shake-up his top team after the May local elections but the plans are on ice in a bid to keep ministers onside.  To mount a leadership challenge, 54 Tories have to submit a letter to Sir Graham Brady who leads the 1922 committee of backbench Conservative MPs. Only Brady knows how many have submitted letters and he keeps it a secret until the threshold is reached. Yesterday, Tory elections guru Lord Hayward predicted Johnson will face a vote of confidence in his leadership. He said the prime minister was 'in trouble' as an increasing number of Tory MPs submit letters of no confidence. 'The number is definitely rising. When it will cross the line is good speculation. I think it will,' he told Sky News.  He said a vote of confidence, even if you win, is not a guarantee that you will continue as the party leader because losing support is an 'attritional process'. Hayward added: 'It's worth remembering Theresa May won a vote of confidence, in theory that gave her another year, but she was out of office within seven months.' May's former chief of staff Gavin Barwell warned there was 'zero evidence' Johnson can regain the public's trust even if he were to win in a vote of confidence among Tory MPs. Lord Barwell, who was in No.10 when May faced her challenges to leadership, said if Johnson were to 'narrowly win' it would be the 'worst outcome for the Conservative Party'. Barwell tweeted: 'His supporters argue that given time he can regain his standing, but there is zero evidence of this so far. He has done well on Ukraine, but it has made no difference to the numbers saying he should go.'", "91a55e97a5893e552dc7f13be00bb8c9d316b4f0a65153f18baf0f3b": "Boris Johnson is in trouble.

Dominic Cummings thinks she would be 'even worse' than Johnson, but given the PM's former top adviser is not exactly the most popular man among many Tory MPs, that criticism might help rather than hurt her. Truss is something of a survivor, having served in the cabinet since 2014, under David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson. She has been environment secretary, justice secretary, chief secretary to the Treasury, trade secretary and now foreign secretary. Her period at the Ministry of Justice was not seen to be a huge success. But she bounced back and now could be knocking on the door of No.10. The 46-year-old campaigned for Remain, but after Leave won the referendum she changed her mind and became an enthusiastic supporter of Brexit, a policy area she is now in charge of. Her jet-setting Instagrammable period as international trade secretary also helped win her fans among the Brexiteer party membership - which will ultimately decide who takes over from Johnson. She is currently fourth in ConservativeHome's cabinet rankings, voted on by Tory members. One of Johnson's main arguments why it would not 'responsible' to kick him out of Downing Street is the ongoing war in Ukraine. But as foreign secretary, Truss has struck a hawkish position when it comes to Russia, and would be able to argue she has experience on the world stage as well as being up to date on the details of the war. On domestic issues, Truss has cultivated a reputation as a free-marketeer defender of the gig economy, arguing the young people embrace rather than reject the changing nature of work. 'This generation are #Uber-riding #Airbnb-ing #Deliveroo-eating #freedomfighters,' she tweeted in 2018.  The Conservative Party under Johnson has pivoted towards culture war in an attempt to create dividing lines with Labour. Truss, who is also equalities minister, has attacked the 'woke bandwagon'. In 2020 she delivered a speech on education in which she said her teachers at school had focused too much on racism and sexism and not enough 'making sure everyone could read and write'. Rishi Sunak The chancellor formally known as 'dishy Rishi' for a long time had been seen as the most likely to succeed Johnson. Having handed out billions during the pandemic alongside slick personal PR, the 42-year-old's ascent seemed almost unstoppable.  But the cost of living crisis as well as revelations about his personal finances have damaged his brand. He now sits fourth from bottom in the ConHome ranking. Like Johnson, Sunak has been fined by police for breaking Covid rules as he was present at the birthday gathering for the PM in the Cabinet Room. News of the fine came amid a torrid time for the chancellor, who had also been under intense pressure over revelations his wife held non-dom tax status and that he held a US green card while serving in No.11. His spring statement mini-Budget in March also triggered a huge backlash, with critics warning it did not to do enough to help people struggling with the cost of living. Sunak moved to address those criticisms in May, with a PS21bn package of measures designed to help people pay for energy bills. While this pleased some in his party, it angered those who are instinctively against higher taxes and more borrowing. Sunak has portrayed himself as a fan of low taxes, a necessary position for any aspiring Tory leader. However he could find it hard to square that circle with Tory MPs and members, given the current overall tax burden is the highest since the late 1940s. The MP for Richmond has also made a few coded criticisms of Johnson, including telling a press conference he 'wouldn't have' attempted to blame Keir Starmer for the failure to prosecute Jimmy Savile, as the PM had. Sunak remains a strong contender. Despite holding the second most important office of state, Sunak remains a relatively fresh face. There is a reason Labour has expended so much energy on attacking him. Ben Wallace The defence secretary is seen to have had a good war. The former soldier is also by far the most popular cabinet minister among the party grassroots. Which counts a lot. In February he told The Sun he was 'not really attracted to anything else' other than his job at the MoD. But that was a while ago. Wallace is seen as being at the forefront of moves to challenge Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Like Truss, he would easily be able to counter any argument he is not ready to take over in No.10 in the middle the war. And unlike Sunak, he is not personally tainted by partygate. The 52-year-old has also long been publicly loyal to Johnson. Quite fiercely. And has survived reshuffle rumours. When Michael Gove dramatically turned on Johnson in the 2016 Tory leadership race, Wallace said Gove would become 'Theon Greyjoy' from Game of Thrones 'by the time I am finished with him'. Greyjoy had his penis cut off. However, while Wallace will likely be seen as a safe pair of hands on foreign affairs, he has not had as much opportunity to set out a domestic agenda as Truss and Sunak. Jeremy Hunt The former cabinet minister stood for the leadership in 2019. He was comfortably beaten by Johnson. Now chairman of the Commons health committee, Hunt has made no secret of his intention to stand in any leadership election. 'I don't rule it out,' he told the New Statesman last week, which in Westminster terms is essentially a declaration that you are running. It is not the first interview he has given in which he has not ruled it out. Following the turmoil of Johnson's time in office, Hunt's main pitch to MPs and the party membership is likely to be based on simply being less chaotic. An adult. A leading face of the Cameron government, Hunt was health secretary for six years. He is likely to make much of that experience post-Covid, especially given the NHS is a reliable general election battleground. Hunt has also recently written a book in which he details his belief the health service is a 'rogue system' that needs reform, a position likely to go down well with Tory MPs. Under Theresa May, Hunt served as foreign secretary. This period will, like Truss, allow him to counter the argument he is not equipped to take over as prime minister in the middle of a European war.  As culture secretary in the early 2010s at the time of Leveson inquiry, Hunt denied 'hiding behind a tree' to avoid reporters. Nadhim Zahawi The Conservatives did very well at the May 2021 local elections, thanks in part to the so-called Covid vaccine bounce. Zahawi, now education secretary, was vaccines minister at the time. If he runs, expect a lot to be made of the broadly successful rollout. Zahawi is the second most popular cabinet minister on the ConHome rating. Born in Iraq, he moved to the UK with his family aged nine in 1976. He went on to co-found polling giant YouGov before becoming an MP in 2010. He is seen as a competent media performer and has very much not ruled himself out of a tilt at the top job. 'I think every member of parliament must feel that they can at some stage put themselves forward to lead their party, their country -- it's a privilege,' he said on Tuesday this week. Penny Mordaunt The trade minister is a good bet as a compromise candidate. A strident Brexiteer with socially liberal views - she spoke at a pro-Leave LGBT event during the referendum - who could also get One Nation Tory MPs onside.  Mordaunt was defence secretary under Theresa May, but was sacked from the cabinet when Johnson took over. She had backed Jeremy Hunt in the 2019 leadership race, despite having been seen as a likely candidate herself. Earlier this week The Daily Telegraph's Chris Hope asked ConHome: 'Why isn't Penny Mordaunt on this list?' when reading the site's cabinet rankings. he obvious answer is, because she is not in the cabinet. But the question illustrates how seriously her chances are taken by many in Westminster.  The 49-year-old's time at the MoD, like Wallace and Truss, would allow her to argue she has the experience to be PM while Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues. And in her current role she has recently loudly promoted her work in the United States trying to forge post-Brexit trade links.  In an interview with City AM on Tuesday, Mordaunt said voters wanted 'professionalism and competence' from government. Partygate, she has said, was 'shameful'. Sajid Javid The health secretary has long been touted as a future PM. Back in 2014, David Cameron said that 'one day I want to hear that title prime minister, followed by a British-Asian name', before telling Javid: 'Just not immediately, if that's OK by you.' Javid ran for leader in 2019. In 2016 he ran on a joint ticket with Stephen Crabb, on the basis he would become chancellor. Javid did eventually become chancellor under Johnson but quit in February 2020 amid a power struggle with Dominic Cummings. Before returning to government in June 2021 following the resignation of Matt Hancock, Javid spent his time on the backbenches burnishing his credentials as a free-marketeer. 'We must resist the call to abandon our free-enterprise, free-trade economic model,' he said in April 2020. 'Combined with low taxes and sensible regulation.' That economic message is one that would play well with many Tory MPs and members. As health secretary, Javid also positioned himself as rhetorically less in favour of Covid rules than his predecessor. Again, this will have gone down well with many on the government benches who were itching for rules to be lifted as soon as possible. Tom Tugendhat The chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee, who is no fan of Johnson, has essentially already declared he will run for the leadership, having said it would be a 'huge privilege'. A former Army officer, the MP for Tonbridge and Malling has long been a thorn in Johnson's side, having said the cost of living crisis means the country needed 'seriousness' at the top of government. Tugendhat was also sharply critical of how the government managed the UK's withdrawal from Afghanistan, branding it 'shameful'. While experienced in foreign affairs matters, his views on domestic policy are less well known. Having not served in government he could argue he is not contaminated by partygate or other failings. However it would also be quite a jump to go straight from the backbenches into No.10. One thing to remember about Conservative Party leadership elections is the initial frontrunner does not always win. ", "c5443be268819d2247ee099fe97a03f83e808f220dad072aea99aca6": "To say the past couple of years have been busy for Ryan O'Connell. Last year saw the second season of his sitcom Special - the sitcom he co-created and starred in - debuting on Netflix to huge acclaim, after which it was revealed he'd joined the cast of the much-awaited Queer As Folk remake. On top of that, he's also about to release his first novel, Just By Looking At Him, which he's already working to have adapted for the big screen. It's been an exciting time for Ryan, he tells HuffPost UK, but not one he's in a particular rush to repeat. 'I can't have a couple of years like that ever again,' he admits. 'I was working so much that I truly felt like I was hanging on by a thread. 'I'm really glad that [projects I've worked on] are coming out, but a lot of this stuff that we're talking about now was born from the pandemic, and trying to stave off existential dread and channel that into work. And now I'm kind of like... oh, I want to have fun. See my friends, and live laugh love.' And while Ryan has enjoyed being 'a lady of leisure', he's already looking to the future, and says directing is the next challenge he hopes to pursue. 'I'd never really taken that time for myself where I really, truly did nothing. But being a lady of leisure only works if you know that it's finite,' he says. 'It was really fun, but because I'm a Virgo, I was then like, 'OK, back to work'. It was also nice to do that knowing I was about to go into the press cycle for the novel and Queer As Folk.' To launch our new Pride interview series, we spoke to Ryan about the queer TV that made him feel seen when he was growing up, befriending his ultimate queer icon and being the 'Kris Jenner of Gen Z'... Who was the first queer person you can remember looking up to? There was a show on The WB called Popular, it was actually Ryan Murphy's first show. And Mary Cherry and Nicole Julian, while not gay men, essentially were gay men. They were these really bitchy high schoolers that were, like, hellbent on destruction and being Machiavellian, and they were the most glamorous, insane characters I'd ever seen on TV. I was maybe 12 years old when the show came out, and I had no idea about what a 'queer sensibility' was until I saw that show. and it was like, 'oh, I'm laughing because I'm gay'. And then it was like, 'oh, I'm gay'. And then of course, Will & Grace. Karen Walker and Jack McFarland were my first real peeks into queerness, like a little lifeline. So, Mary Cherry, Nicole Julian, Karen Walker and Jack McFarland. Notice that there's only one actual gay man on that list. What was the first LGBTQ+ TV show or film that you remember resonating with you? I was eight years when My So-Called Life came out - I should not have been watching it, but my family was obsessed, so we'd watch it every week. And in that show, there was a character called Ricky, who was queer. It wasn't even really discussed that much, which I think was kind of transgressive in its own way. There wasn't, like, a 'very special gay episode', he just was gay. And I remember being eight years old and feeling like, 'hmmm I really seem to connect with this character for reasons that I'm not quite sure about and also scared of and also intrigued, dot dot dot'. So definitely My So-Called Life, Popular and, of course, Will & Grace. What's a song you associate with your own coming out? I came out when I was 17 on the last day of my junior year in high school. And I did it because I had a crush on this boy, and I knew that in order to date him I would have to come out of the clos' and live my truth. And that summer was this magical coming-of-age, queer Criterion collection vibe. There was this movie I was watching at the time called Cherish, this small indie film that nobody had seen - and no one has still seen it - and the theme song of that movie was Cherish by The Association. Remember that song? It's like an old-school 1960s kind of haunted song. And that was me and my boyfriend's song. Or at least it was in my head. What was the most recent LGBTQ+ show or film that made an impact on you? I watched Stranger By The Lake in quarantine, and I loved it. It's this horny French queer thriller. There are cumshots, there are uncut dicks, it's sort of spooky spaghetti, I love it. And of course I love The Other Two. Iconic. But I don't watch a lot of scripted shows, to be honest. Because I work on scripted, sometimes it feels like I'm doing my homework, so basically I only watch Below Deck. Who is your ultimate queer icon? That's a really, really good question. I'm just going to go with the first person that comes to mind, and that's the director Gregg Araki, who did films like The Doom Generation, Nowhere, Mysterious Skin and The Living End.  I feel corny saying that, because I've actually become friends with Gregg - not to bra-aag. But whenever I'm with him, I'm always like, 'you have no idea how obsessed I am with you'. Basically, in the early 90s, he created this new wave of queer cinema, that was so amazing, and he always included a lot of Shoegaze which is my favourite genre of music. And then next to Gregg, I would say Parker Posey. When I was growing up, Party Girl, Clockwatchers, House Of Yes, all those indie films were so major to me. Those are two icons to me. She's amazing, she's so specific and so herself. One scripted thing I am watching right now is The Staircase which ordinarily I would not do because it's like, 'honey we've already seen the documentary, must we revisit again?'. But honey, if Parker is there, I have to RSVP. Who is a queer person in the public eye right now that makes you excited about the future? I am biased, but Fin Argus. They're in Queer As Folk, they play a character called Mingus. They're 23 years old, and when I first met them I was like, 'OK, they're 23, I'm 35, we probably won't have anything in common, they're only a child'. But we actually got extremely close and I think they're so brilliant. They also do music and their music is incredible. I'm obsessed Gen Z. I'll go on the record as saying I feel like a spiritual grandfather to Gen Z, I'm a big fan. I am very the Kris Jenner of Gen Z, that's a moniker that I will take proudly. What's your message for the next generation of LGBTQ+ people? We live in a really mind-fuck-y time, in the sense that the world as we know it is becoming more and more progressive, but because of that, there is a fight to retain the old thought. And that fight is actually winning. So it's this really very weird, emotional, whiplash-y time where the minority is coming into power, but their views don't reflect the culture that we live in today. That's a very hard place to be in, and it's a confusing place to be in. But my one piece of advice is to know the culture is going with you, rather than against you. And what you're seeing is, there's a lot of fear and people wanting to maintain the status quo. But that's going to change with or without them. You can't change the fact the culture is becoming more progressive. So, even though it's a very scary time for a lot of minorities, more people are with them rather than against them. The reality is that if it wasn't real, if the change wasn't happening, if the world wasn't becoming more progressive, there wouldn't be these death rattles of the old guard. These last power grabs. So it makes sense, even though it's terrible. Ryan O'Connell's new book Just By Looking At Him is out on Tuesday 7 June.", "64da94719a22cfa54cc5976bb6914c56a43aba3c40ec56a931bd545e": "Warm weather and booze often go hand-in-hand. Instead of hibernating inside alone on your couch or meeting friends in cozy cafes, summer brings invites to backyard cookouts, hanging out by the pool or meeting up in the park - and alcohol is a guest who usually shows up. These days, there are a lot of well-crafted, delicious nonalcoholic drinks to sip instead, but if you do want to enjoy some alcoholic beverages, there are some key ways that day drinking affects the body that you should be aware of.  Day drinking can affect you differently than drinking at night Family doctor Dr. Sandra Luyindula says that regardless of what time someone drinks alcohol, they are consuming something that's a sedative.  'Many people think that having alcohol before bed will help them sleep, but it actually does the opposite, disrupting sleep,' she says, adding that people are more likely to wake up throughout the night if they drink alcohol before bed.  So does that mean you can knock a few back during the day and avoid sleep-disrupting effects in the evening? It depends on how much you drink.  'The longer the time period between drinking alcohol and bedtime, the less it can negatively affect sleep, since the body has had time to process and eliminate the alcohol,' says Dr. Anna Balabanova Shannahan,  assistant professor of family medicine at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine. 'But if large quantities are imbibed during the day and it is still in your system, it can still disrupt nighttime sleep.'  Shannahan added that since alcohol can make you feel sleepy, it could cause you to want to take a nap, which could then affect how well you sleep that night. OK, so alcohol can still disrupt your sleep no matter what time you're drinking. But here's one way drinking during the day works in your favour, versus at night: 'When people drink during the day, it's usually with food. Food slows down the absorption of alcohol and the effects of alcohol are decreased,' says Dr. Alicia Shelly, an internal medicine doctor.  That said, Shelly also said that alcohol can negatively impact digestion. 'Alcohol in general can increase the speed of digestion and put the individual at risk for diarrhea,' she says. Shannahan reiterated this, specifying that drinking alcohol at any time can impact the gut. 'Alcohol can irritate the digestive system no matter the time of day, even potentially leading to stomach inflammation over time, which can affect how your body processes nutrients,' she says. Besides the gut, Luyindula said day drinking can impact your mood, too. Since alcohol is a depressant, things can go downhill later in the day.  'No matter the time of day one drinks alcohol, it ultimately has a depressant effect, depleting 'happiness hormones' like dopamine and serotonin,' Shannahan says. That means you may feel euphoric day drinking with your friends, but later, once you're home alone and that buzz is wearing off, you could feel down in the dumps. Drinking during the day can also put you at risk for dehydration. 'We know that alcohol has a dehydrating effect on the body and during the day this dehydration can be amplified by being in the sun, which can be dangerous,' Shelly says. You're more likely to drink sugary drinks in the daytime The type of alcoholic drink you're likely to drink during the daytime will affect you differently, too - think about how much sugar is in your brunch mimosa.  'If you're drinking something sugary, like a margarita or daiquiri, the sugar slows down the absorption of alcohol in the bloodstream, so a lot of people end up drinking more to feel the effects of the alcohol,' Luyindula explains. 'Also, not tasting the alcohol as much [in a sugary drink] can make people drink more.' This means someone may drink more than they usually would and at a quicker pace.  While consuming alcohol in excess is never good for health, Shannahan says that regularly consuming sugary alcoholic drinks can be especially detrimental.  'Added sugars in general can lead to health problems including diabetes, heart disease, inflammation and more, so it's best to limit high-sugar beverages,' she says. She added that any alcohol can lead to dangerous drops in blood sugar, especially for those with diabetes, as the body becomes focused on metabolising the alcohol instead of maintaining healthy blood sugar levels.  'It's also important to be aware, particularly for those with blood sugar issues, that symptoms of low blood sugar can mimic symptoms of being drunk,' Shannahan says. No, you're not naturally more alert (or less drunk) just because it's daytime No matter what you're drinking and what time it is, alcohol impacts cognition. That means you absolutely shouldn't drive home after drinking alcohol, no matter what time it is. 'Alcohol slows brain activity down, so if you have a couple drinks at lunch, you can only imagine how your work productivity and quality will be in the afternoon,' Luyindula says. In other words, if you're going to day drink, don't plan on doing any work later.  In general, Luyindula said it's important to be aware of how much you're drinking, no matter what time it is. 'As of 2019, there are 14.5 million adults in the U.S. with alcohol use disorder. That's a lot,' she says.  'Consuming three drinks or more a day for women and four drinks or more a day for men is considered binge drinking,' she continues. If this is something you're doing regularly, she urges you to talk to your primary care doctor about it. 'We won't judge you and will get you the help you need. Otherwise, your drinking habit will eventually affect your family, work, health and finances.'  With that in mind and now knowing exactly how day drinking affects the body, if you are going to day drink this summer, now you know a bit more what to expect, as far as your body is concerned.

The Queen is photographed in her Windsor Castle home, sitting on a cushioned window seat, with the historic residence's famous Round Tower visible in the distance. With her hands resting on her lap and her hair curled in its familiar style, the Queen is dressed in a dusky dove blue Angela Kelly coat made of wool Charmelaine. The shiny pearl and diamante scalloped beading, embroidered around the collar and cascading down front trim, is perhaps seemingly a nod to her historic Platinum anniversary. The Queen is the first British monarch to celebrate 70 years on the throne, and the commemorations get under way in full on Thursday with the traditional Trooping the Colour parade and balcony appearance. The image was taken by photographer Ranald Mackechnie in the Victoria Vestibule in the Queen's private apartments at Windsor. Mackechnie took two previous portraits of the Queen alongside the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge and Prince George to mark her 90th birthday in 2016. He said of being commissioned to take the official Jubilee portrait: 'It is an honour to be asked and a privilege to undertake.' Also visible in the background is the statue of King Charles II which stands in the Quadrangle of the Castle. The seated Queen has been facing mobility problems for a number of months and has confessed to not being able to move in the past. Royals fans gathered in central London will be hoping to see the Queen on the balcony after the Trooping parade, as well as at the service of thanksgiving in St Paul's Cathedral on Friday and possibly again on the balcony after the carnival Pageant finale on Sunday. As well as wearing her trademark pearls, the Queen also has on her wedding and diamond engagement ring, as she usually does, and her gold watch.

The jury awarded Depp $10 million in compensatory damages and $5 million in punitive damages. Moments later, the panel delivered a mixed verdict in Heard's countersuit, awarding her $2 million in compensatory damages. Depp was not present, having flown to London for a surprise performance over the weekend, but Heard could be seen in the courtroom while the verdict was being read, looking down at the table in front of her.   'The disappointment I feel today is beyond words,' Heard said in a statement. 'I'm heartbroken that the mountain of evidence still was not enough to stand up to the disproportionate power, influence, and sway of my ex-husband.'   She called the verdict a 'setback' for women, 'to a time when a woman who spoke up and spoke out could be publicly shamed and humiliated.'   'It sets back the idea that violence against women is to be taken seriously,' she said.  Heard has publicly alleged since 2016 that Depp physically abused her during the course of their relationship, which began on the set of the 2011 film The Rum Diary and culminated in a brief marriage. Depp says he was the one who was abused, and that Heard's accusation caused him to lose out on lucrative film roles. 'Six years later, the jury gave me my life back,' Depp said in a statement posted to Instagram following the verdict. 'I am truly humbled.' Jurors sat through six weeks of arguments and testimony preparing them to answer a number of complicated questions about the case, including whether the claims were made with 'actual malice', a high legal standard. Although the jurors' identities are under seal, CourtTV -- which provided live video of the proceedings -- reported from inside the courtroom that the panel was made up of five men and two women, apparently ranging in age from their 20s to one man who could be older than 60. A British court faced with similar questions about abuse in the relationship handed down a verdict in favour of Heard in late 2020, ruling that a UK tabloid headline calling Depp a 'wife beater' was not defamatory owing to the strength and volume of Heard's evidence that she was abused. The claim was 'substantially true', Judge Andrew Nicol said in his ruling. The Washington Post editorial published in 2018 lay at the centre of the US case, filed in Fairfax, Virginia, state court. With help from attorneys at the American Civil Liberties Union, Heard wrote the article describing herself as a domestic violence survivor -- although not explicitly, and without mentioning Depp by name. Heard is called a 'public figure representing domestic abuse' in the piece. The civil trial, held in Virginia because The Washington Post is printed there, kicked off in mid-April and featured lengthy testimony from both actors. A procession of experts -- including dueling psychiatric professionals who attempted to diagnose Heard and Depp -- along with family members, former friends, employees, law enforcement officers and top figures in the entertainment industry rounded out the witness list. A ferocious pro-Depp fandom ensured that social media mentions of the trial skewed heavily in favour of the Pirates of the Caribbean star. Anyone who bucked the trend risked verbal attacks and online harassment. Outside the courtroom each day, a crowd of Depp's supporters -- largely women -- held handmade signs and cheered as his black SUV turned toward the courthouse entrance and blared reggae music when the actor emerged. Eventually the firehose of online vitriol directed at Heard sparked concern from groups that advocate for domestic violence survivors, which said the spectacle could discourage victims from coming forward. Depp's team went to great lengths to paint Heard as an attention-seeker who completely fabricated her story. One of his attorneys, Camille Vasquez, who emerged as a breakout star in the Depp fandom, repeatedly told the court that Heard was a 'liar' who wanted the world to 'believe her lies'. Much of the testimony shared at trial concerned opposing perspectives on a series of violent incidents that allegedly took place during the relationship, such as the private plane ride where Depp allegedly slapped and kicked Heard to the floor while in a blackout state after accusing her of having an affair with actor James Franco. Text messages displayed in court indicated that Depp had been taking drugs and alcohol at the time. Later, Depp's assistant told Heard by text that the actor had to be informed as to what happened on the plane and cried upon hearing it, pledging to correct his behaviour. Depp wished to see Heard in person, according to the assistant's texts, but she was determined to book her own flight away from him.  Other records shown in court repeatedly supported Heard's version of events. IO Tillett Wright, a former mutual friend of the couple who in 2016 penned an essay for Refinery29 to explain why he called the police during a fight of theirs -- 'because she never would' -- said in testimony played in court that he had seen physical evidence Depp was abusive. Several former friends who were deposed similarly described Depp as a person who could be volatile. Perhaps the most disturbing episode took place in March 2015 at an Australian mansion Depp had rented while filming the fifth Pirates installment. The couple had been married on Depp's private island just one month before. Heard testified that, over three days, Depp consumed an unknown quantity of drugs and alcohol and began to rage at her, shoving her up against a wall, tearing her nightgown and, at one point, sexually assaulting her with a liquor bottle. She said she fled to her room and, when she emerged hours later, found the house in a state of complete disarray. 'I was scared,' she testified. 'I had just married him.' Photographs of the house displayed in court show cryptic messages scrawled in what Heard said was blood from one of Depp's fingers, which had been partially severed. The jury heard two explanations for the injury: Depp said his fingertip was sliced off when Heard threw a glass bottle at him, and Heard said she believed it happened as Depp was wrecking a landline telephone. Walls, mirrors and at least one lampshade were subject to the graffiti, which was also done in what appeared to be paint.  The incident prompted Disney to pause production of the Pirates movie while Depp was flown back to Los Angeles for emergency surgery -- an expensive move for the studio. Tracey Jacobs, an agent who represented Depp for 30 years, testified that the actor became increasingly problematic on set in the last years of their working relationship, showing up hours late without knowing all of his lines. She had to fly to Australia twice to deal with him while making the fifth Pirates, she said. The actor has been open in the past about his drug and alcohol struggles. In his testimony, he described how his life radically changed with the global success of the Pirates franchise, making it hard to go out in public with his kids, and that he tended to lean on substances to cope with difficult emotions. Yet he refused to describe it as a problem. 'I am not some maniac who needs to be high or loaded all the time,' he told the court. Not only had Depp never hit Heard, he testified, he had never hit any woman in his life. A traumatic childhood with an abusive mother had supposedly steered him away from physical violence. According to Depp, it was Heard who 'bullied' him and subjected him to 'demeaning name-calling'. One of the trial's most-referenced audio clips featured Heard admitting to striking her former husband, telling him, 'Babe, you're not 'punched'. I was hitting you.' Heard testified that she had been pushing back on Depp's alleged tendency to use exaggerated language for dramatic effect. Depp said that he simply walked away from their arguments. But his ex-wife described a cycle wherein Depp would become agitated and disappear -- allegedly on a bender -- until he showed up again, more sober and determined not to act badly. Text messages and emails read in court revealed ample references to Depp's 'monster', a term for the side of him that allegedly came out when he was drunk, high or both. He repeatedly apologised in the messages. Heard told jurors at several points in her testimony that she stayed with Depp because he could be very charming when he was sober, and she believed he could change. Researchers have found that one common pattern in abusive relationships is a partner's alternation between violence, apologies and pleasant behavior. Still, Depp's attorneys accused Heard of shameless fakery in what amounted to a yearslong plot to ruin Depp's reputation for her financial gain, suggesting that Heard could have digitally manipulated photographs in which bruises appear on her face. Instead of standing up as a domestic violence victim, Heard had spun 'elaborate, exaggerated, fantastical accounts of abuse' and given the 'performance of her life' in court, Vasquez said. An attorney for Heard, Benjamin Rottenborn, used his closing statements to paint Depp's arguments as eminently harmful: 'victim blaming at its most disgusting.' 'If you didn't take pictures, it didn't happen. If you did take pictures, they're fake,' Rottenborn said of Depp's approach. 'They are trying to trick you,' he told the court, 'to believe that Amber has to be perfect to win.'", "30394c59411ddb8a980e150e9ac144a740991fcc690eba3a02fc7687": "", "f369672f9908840f0509ccad3065b3ce24a7fb862a5aa40ce8a7be5a": "Drip drip ... Boris Johnson is facing the looming prospect of a leadership challenge in the wake of Sue Gray's damning report on lockdown rule-breaking parties in Downing Street. As each day brings another Conservative expressing disquiet at the PM's leadership, there is a growing belief in Westminster that it is only a matter of when - not if - the 54 letters needed from Tory MPs to trigger a confidence vote are reached.  Not all the no-confidence letters submitted to Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 committee, are made public. And some MPs who have have been critical of Johnson may not have gone as far as to put in a letter. In any case, here's the up-to-date list of the discontents: 18 who have sent letters and some of a total of 71 who could reportedly be 'potential letter writers'. MPs to put letters in Peter Aldous 'After a great deal of soul-searching, I have reached the conclusion that the prime minister should resign.' Aaron Bell 'Does the prime minister think I'm a fool?' Andrew Bridgen  'There is obviously and rightly still a lot of anger about the culture in No 10 during the lockdown period.' Steve Brine 'I have said throughout this sorry saga I cannot and will not defend the indefensible. Rule makers cannot be law-breakers.' Elliot Colburn 'I am especially appalled at the revelations of the poor treatment of security and cleaning staff at No.10, so my letter remains submitted.'  Tobias Ellwood  'I don't think the prime minister realises how worried colleagues are in every corner of the party.' Roger Gale 'It sounds to me, I am afraid, very much as though politically the prime minister is a dead man walking.' Nick Gibb 'To restore trust, we need to change the prime minister.' Mark Harper  'I am very sorry to have to say this, but I no longer think he is worthy of the great office he holds.'  Stephen Hammond 'I have been critical of the prime minister's behaviour and the culture that existed in Number 10. All I can do as a backbencher is speak out and submit a letter.' Alicia Kearns 'It is wrong that families were banned from saying goodbye to their dying loved ones, whilst the Prime Minister was complicit in the holding of many goodbye parties for his staff, which we now know displayed a complete disregard for restrictions and were complete with vomiting, fighting and bullying.' Anthony Mangnall  'I can no longer support the PM. His actions and mistruths are overshadowing the extraordinary work of so many excellent ministers and colleagues.' Anne Marie Morris 'The fact that there may have been social events held in No.10 in breach of the rules that they themselves imposed is frankly insulting to those who did what they were told.' Bob Neill 'Trust is the most important commodity in politics, but these events have undermined trust in not just the office of the prime minister, but in the political process itself.' Caroline Nokes 'He looks like a liability and I think he either goes now, or he goes in three years' time at a general election.'  Gary Streeter 'I cannot reconcile the pain and sacrifice of the vast majority of the British public during lockdown with the attitude and activities of those working in Downing Street.' John Stevenson 'The continuing criticism, revelations and questions are debilitating for the government at a time when there are so many other important and critical issues to be addressed.' Will Wragg 'A series of unforced errors are deeply damaging to the perception of the party. The prime minister's position is untenable.' Critical Tory MPs The number of letters to have arrived in Brady's postbag is likely to be much higher - with MPs who have been damning of the prime minister, going as far as to say he should resign, still keeping their cards close to their chest.  Steve Baker 'If the prime minister occupied any other office of senior responsibility...he would be long gone.' David Davis  'In the name of God, go.' Iain Duncan Smith 'This is unforgivable...the culture has become lazy and slack about what happens after hours, what happens in offices.' Andrea Leadsom  'There have been unacceptable failings of leadership that cannot be tolerated and are the responsibility of the prime minister.' Tim Loughton 'Boris Johnson's position is now untenable...his resignation is the only way to bring this whole unfortunate episode to an end.'  Huw Merriman 'We all know that if the prime minister doesn't ship up, then they have to shape out.' Andrew Mitchell 'I have to tell him he no longer enjoys my support.' Julian Sturdy 'While I thought it important to wait for the conclusion of the Metropolitan Police investigation and the publication of the Sue Gray report, I am now unable to give the prime minister the benefit of the doubt and feel it is now in the public interest for him to resign.' Robert Syms 'I am considering whether or not I ought to put in a letter. I've had emails from what I would call Christian, decent, honest, honourable types of Tory voters, who say they feel embarrassed about voting Conservative with Boris Johnson.' Tom Tugendhat 'We need this to change. Now.' Craig Whittaker 'I don't believe for one minute that Boris Johnson has taken responsibility for his actions, an apology doesn't constitute taking responsibility and that's why I've asked him to resign.' Jeremy Wright 'If leadership is in part about setting the right tone for the organisation you lead, the tone represented by the routine disregard for the spirit, and often the letter, of the Covid rules which Sue Gray describes betrayed at best a casual and at worst a contemptuous attitude to the sacrifices made and distress felt by the many who observed rigorously both spirit and letter of those rules.'", "d226db3c03da32f333a2636185ec7ebb7124ac1ad4efb0c031442b94": "Jada Pinkett Smith has said she hopes her husband Will can 'reconcile' with Chris Rock following their altercation at this year's Oscars. Back in March, Chris was a guest presenter during the Oscars ceremony, during which the comic made a joke about Jada's shaved head. Following the comment, Will came on stage and slapped the comic, urging him to keep 'my wife's name out of your fucking mouth'. The clip quickly became talked about all over the globe, with the Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air star resigning from the Film Academy shortly afterwards, and Oscars organisers banning Will from the event for the next 10 years. In the latest episode of her web series Red Table Talk, Jada dedicated the conversation to alopecia, the hair loss condition she has previously spoken about being affected by. 'This is a really important Red Table Talk on alopecia,' she began. 'Considering what I've been through with my own health and what happened at the Oscars, thousands have reached out to me with their stories. 'I'm using this moment to give our alopecia family an opportunity to talk about what it's like to have this condition and to inform people about what alopecia actually is.' Jada added: 'Now, about Oscar night. My deepest hope is that these two intelligent, capable men have an opportunity to heal, talk this out and reconcile. The state of the world today, we need them both. And we all actually need one another more than ever. 'Until then, Will and I are continuing to do what we have done for the last 28 years, and that's keep figuring out this thing called life together. Thank you for listening.' Will, who was awarded Best Actor for his role in King Richard just minutes after the slap incident, later apologised for his actions. In a statement announcing his resignation from the Oscars Academy, he said: 'My actions at the 94th Academy Awards presentation were shocking, painful, and inexcusable. 'The list of those I have hurt is long and includes Chris, his family, many of my dear friends and loved ones, all those in attendance, and global audiences at home. I betrayed the trust of the Academy. 'I deprived other nominees and winners of their opportunity to celebrate and be celebrated for their extraordinary work. I am heartbroken. 'I want to put the focus back on those who deserve attention for their achievements and allow the Academy to get back to the incredible work it does to support creativity and artistry in film. 'So, I am resigning from membership in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and will accept any further consequences the Board deems appropriate.'", "6bd8f414dcfbf974587896484aa5ae211b84cc51e8db23fe92c7e614": "'Tis the season for sangria! This wine-based punch, which has been written about since 200 BC is beloved and for good reason. It's fresh, fruity and incredibly versatile -- the perfect pitcher drink for picnics and parties.  The Romans may have been the first to write about sangria, but it began to grow in popularity thanks to Spanish and Hispanic Amercianrestaurants that served it in the 1940s. It made an appearance at the 1964 World's Fair and has come in and out of style since. Lucky for us, sangria is back and better than ever.  We're diving into the punch bowl with mixologists and drinks professionals from around the world to learn all about how to craft the perfect sangria. The anatomy of Sangria The notion that sangria is just wine and fruit is false. It's a mix of wine, spirits, sweetener, juice and fruit, and mixologists love it because it allows for limitless creativity.  Wine All sangria starts with a bottle of wine. Experts agree the wine should be fruit-forward, acidic (makes your mouth water) and if it's red, low in tannins. They also agree on something else: Stop using bad wine! Evie Negri-Albert, better known as @drinksbyevie, gets it. 'It's a common misconception that you can [take] subpar wine, turn it into sangria and it'll magically become better. It doesn't work like that,' Negri-Albert said. She has tips for picking a wine. 'Start with a quality wine that you know and love -- this doesn't equal expensive! There are so many wonderful wines in the $15-$30 (PS12-PS24) range that I love to use to set your sangria up for success,' she advised. Red: Garnacha (what Grenache is called in Spain) is a favourite for red sangria. Stephen 'Pip' Roffi, the mixologist at Village Garage Distillery in Bennington, Vermont, has developed a red sangria recipe that approaches the wine deliberately. 'I usually use a Grenache or a Malbec,' Roffi said. For Malbec, he's specific. 'Definitely a Malbec from Argentina or Chile.' Down the street, at a nanobrewery called Harvest Brewing, Sean Dunleavy makes his famous sangria with a Pinot Noir/Cabernet Blend. The low-tannin, high-acid Pinot Noir balances the bold cabernet.  Dunleavy sticks with his lauded red sangria but has thoughts on using sparkling wine. 'I think I would do it with Prosecco. Something really bubbly ... I think that would be fun.' Sparkling: If you do want to use a sparkling wine, it's easy to find wines that fit the sangria formula, since most are tannin-free and high acid.  Rose: And then, of course, you can always use rose for a pink sangria. Reach for a bottle that meets Negri-Albert's price point but tastes far more expensive. White: White wine is the perfect base, with no tannins and refreshing acidity. At Bennington, Vermont's The 421 Craft Bar & Kitchen, mixologists Desiree Hazen and Samantha Joy use Sauvignon Blanc. They create new sangrias seasonally and are considering Gruner Vltliner, a crisp, Austrian white wine known for its distinctive pear flavours. Spirits Booze provides structure while balancing sweetness in sangria. It also makes sangria last longer so you don't have to finish the pitcher. Traditional sangria uses brandy (a neutral grape spirit), but these days, mixologists are grabbing all sorts of high-alcohol ingredients.  At The 421 Craft Bar & Kitchen, Hazen and Joy use Tito's Vodka in their current sangria offering. 'It's clean and smooth and doesn't make it too boozy.' The Village Garage uses 5-year aged Vermont whiskey with locally sourced, smoked maple syrup. And down in Rockwall, Texas, at Onassis Greek Taphouse + Kitchen, they're taking white sangria in a new direction by using Stray Dog Gin. Sangria is best when it's complex, so don't be afraid to play with bitters, liqueurs or infused vodka to raise the complexity. Juice Orange juice is the most popular fruit juice found in red sangria, but the creative mixologists at The 421 Craft Bar & Kitchen have changed this up completely. Instead of juice, Hazen and Joy use tea. 'We blend Sauvignon Blanc, Tito's, peach tea, green tea, Metcalfe's Peach Liqueur, honey, fresh mint and fresh lemons and serve it over ice garnished with lemon and orange slices,' Hazen said. Sweetener You could make simple syrup (by boiling equal parts water and sugar), but the options go far beyond this bar staple. Molasses, maple syrup and honey add depth of flavour to sangria. Another option is to make fruit syrups by heating and stirring two parts fruit juice and one part sugar until dissolved. If you want a sangria without fruit and seeds floating in it, this is the way to go.  The formula Some restaurateurs, like Mark Soletina, managing partner at Chicago's Ba-Ba-Reeba, like to keep it simple. 'Wine plus brandy plus orange liqueur plus fruit; those are the basics of all of our sangrias,' Soletina said. 'We try to keep it classic while also playing with seasonal fruit flavours. The classic red sangria is still our favourite, but the fresh fruit of the season is always the most popular with our guests!' Soletina said. If you want to develop your own sangria, here's the basic recipe to start with.   Fruit: 1-2 cups   Wine: 1 bottle   Bitters/liqueurs: 1/4-1/2 cup   Spirits: 1/4-1/2 cup   Juice: 1/4-1/2 cup   Sweetener: 1/8-1/4 cup   Go forth and slay Experts are excited about sangria and now that you're armed with a base recipe and great advice, you should be, too. Just start with that recipe and then mix and match flavours until you get it down. You'd be amazed what you come up with. Sangria is delightful, even if you don't include alcohol. If you want a booze-free Sangria, check out TOST or Nozeco as a base.  Here's a final tip - you can extend sangria season into winter. 'During colder months, I love to use more citrus fruits, and fresh herbs like tarragon with a crisp white wine,' Negri-Albert said. That can be the base for your next pitcher drink - get to it!", "0968ed107860a8629458edbb18b15d88dc7d5633178e25430d11fd16": "", "485b4ad5e5337b473bf28b80a4600115be0f52e675e446dd4e9042f4": "Nadine Dorries has said there is a 'coordinated campaign' to remove Boris Johnson as prime minister. Johnson is facing a vote of no confidence in his leadership, as a steady stream of Tory MPs demand he resign in the wake of the Sue Gray report into partygate. The calls have come from across different wings of the Conservative Party, but Dorries said rebel MPs were not acting on their own. 'There is obviously, I think probably led by one or two individuals, a campaign behind the scenes to try attempt to remove the prime minister for individual reasons to do with personal ambition and other reasons,' the culture secretary said on Wednesday. But asked by to BBC Radio 4 who the ringleader were, the close ally of Johnson said: 'I have no idea.' She added: 'There is obviously a coordinated campaign.' Dorries addeed: 'I think what we are talking about is becoming very much a Westminster-centric, Westminster bubble issue and what I detect out in the country is that people are wanting to move on.' Johnson could be forced from office as soon as next week, if 54 MPs submit letters of no confidence and over half of them vote to remove him as leader. Earlier, the PM rejected the suggestion he should quit. 'Why am I still here? I am still here because we've got huge pressures economically we've got to get on,' he told Mumsnet. 'I just cannot see how it would be responsible right now, given everything that is going on, simply to abandon the project on which I embarked.' Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tories, is the only person who knows the number of letters that have been sent in.

In an interview with Mumsnet on Wednesday, the prime minister said he would not 'abandon' his job. It come as Tory MPs inch closer to forcing a no confidence vote in his leadership. Johnson could be forced from office as soon as next week, if 54 MPs submit letters of no confidence and over half of them vote to remove him as leader. The interview, which took place in Downing Street, began with Johnson being asked: 'Why we should you believe anything you say when it has been proven you are a habitual liar?' Defending his actions during lockdown breaking gatherings in No.10, Johnson said: 'We had to keep morale high. 'Everybody was working blindingly hard. They were all under the rules meant to be here. They had the exemption for work purposes. 'What I thought I was doing was simply doing what is right for a leader in any circumstances and that's to thank people for their service. If you don't do that people feel under-appreciated.' Johnson had been asked why it was ok for him to attend a leaving drinks for departing communications director Lee Cain, while the public were banned from going to funerals.

But a baby has to eat when a baby has to eat, whether that's in a store, at a restaurant or on a plane. Mums who feed in public sometimes find themselves on the receiving end of dirty looks, eye rolls or rude comments from strangers. For plus-size moms, breastfeeding in public can be even more daunting, as they risk being shamed not only for feeding their babies out in the open, but also for existing in a fat body. In an essay for Romper, journalist Marie Southard Ospina wrote about a time when a man called her 'fucking disgusting' - among other cruel things - for breastfeeding her eight-month-old daughter on a train.  'Although I have no experience breastfeeding in public as a thin woman, this exchange reified my fear that breastfeeding in public when you're fat is even more negatively received than doing so when your body is culturally deemed 'acceptable,'' she wrote. Of course, there are mums of all different sizes who are able to breastfeed in public without incident - which may have to do, in part, with attitudes toward breastfeeding where they live. But sometimes just the fear of having a confrontation like Ospina's is enough to keep nursing women at home or, when they do go out, feeding their babies in public restrooms, the car or hidden beneath breastfeeding covers. What plus-size mums deal with when they breastfeed in public For plus-size mums with larger breasts, just getting the baby into a comfortable and effective feeding position on the go can be cumbersome - especially if they usually need to use props like nursing pillows or are trying to do it without showing a lot of skin. 'Sometimes I see my smaller-boobed friends and wish I could leisurely lift my shirt and attach my baby so smoothly and gracefully. But I can't,' Kenda H., a mother of four, tells HuffPost. 'As a plus-size nurser, if I lift my shirt, this belly of mine hangs out. That's cause for anxiety for me. And as a big-boobed nurser, I've got to fully expose dang near my full breast in order to latch. Nipple and all. There's just no graceful way to do it, and the nervousness makes it worse.' Suz Gillies-Smith is a body acceptance advocate and mother of two who runs the @plussizebreastfeeding Instagram account. She said she's received her fair share of judgmental glares when nursing out and about.  'As a fat person, I'm used to being looked at or judged while in public, and I think this made me more resilient to judgments about breastfeeding,' Gillies-Smith tells HuffPost. 'I received many dirty looks with my first baby and if I've learned anything about parenting, it's that no matter what you choose to do, someone is always going to have an opinion.' She eventually figured out how to breastfeed while wearing her baby in a ring sling carrier, which allowed her to more easily and discreetly feed on the go.  'This provides some additional privacy,' Gillies-Smith says. 'It also helps with the physical aspect of having to hold baby in place. With larger breasts that point downward, just holding baby to my chest isn't effective.' Sharing photos and stories about her breastfeeding journey on social media has also made Gillies-Smith a target of harassment online.  'I frequently get nasty comments and people DMing me telling me I'm disgusting,' she says. 'All these nasty experiences tell me is that I need to keep doing what I'm doing because the general public still doesn't respect the needs of both the breastfeeding infant and the breastfeeder.'  Writer Katie Cloyd, a mother of three, says she was initially 'very uncomfortable' breastfeeding in public with her first child. But that discomfort dissipated over time.  'I wasn't comfortable in my own body, and the idea of showing any of it to the world was terrifying,' she tells HuffPost. 'I got more comfortable with my second, and by my third, I didn't even own a nursing cover. We wrapped up our nursing journey a few months ago, but before that, I breastfed my baby in any public place without one bit of fear or hesitation. 'Boobies are for babies,' and when mine needed to eat, I was not going to deny her, regardless of how society feels about my body.' How to support breastfeeding mums of all sizes As curve model and new mum Hunter McGrady told Yahoo Life last year, 'We rarely ever see plus-size women represented in any regular [everyday] life, let alone breastfeeding, pregnancy, none of it.' For that reason, just seeing mums with different body types nursing out in the world - and in media - can be powerful. Case in point: the period underwear brand Thinx recently featured a plus-size mum nursing her baby girl in one of its Facebook advertisements. The effusive comments on the post show how rare - and meaningful - this kind of representation is.  'This representation matters SO MUCH,' one woman wrote. 'We always see thin mothers nursing in the cradle hold. Seeing a curvy, woman of colour, nursing in the way that works for her body and her child. I am forever here for it!' 'Why am I crying? I am currently sitting here feeding my 2-month-old and have NEVER seen a woman in an ad that embodies me so much,' said another.  Charli Michele, the model featured in the ad, tells HuffPost she has received a lot of love for the campaign - especially from other plus-sized mums who said they appreciated seeing a more realistic postpartum body.  'They also loved the representation of me being a brown mama breastfeeding,' Michele tells HuffPost. 'There is a lack of media coverage of brown breastfeeding mums - especially plus-size - so I was happy that I was able to represent this category!'  She says she often feeds her daughter in public, but there's been a few occasions in which a stranger has asked her to cover up. 'I responded back and asked them to put a napkin over their mouth every time they took a bite and see how they feel. They didn't say much after that,' Michele says. Another way to show your support for breastfeeding mums? Gillies-Smith suggests that when you see someone breastfeeding in public, consider taking a second to tell them they're doing a good job.  'Nursing in public can be difficult for many reasons,' she says. 'Judgment from others shouldn't be a reason it's challenging.'  Both Gillies-Smith and Cloyd also mentioned the importance of advocating to make public places more nursing-friendly by providing comfortable chairs and lactation rooms.  'Most public spaces are not set up to accommodate breastfeeding, plus-size or not,' Gillies-Smith says.  Kenda offered some words of encouragement for plus-size mums apprehensive about nursing in public: Tune out the noise around you so you can just be present with your baby.  'Let go of the fear of what others think and just feed that baby!' she says. 'It may not be as seamless [for you] as some other mamas... but it's such a beautiful time. And just because we don't look like a model doesn't mean we don't deserve the right and joy of being out, enjoying life without feeling like our baby will get hungry and someone will see [our bodies].'", "08cb23c7e5cd2eeebcc553acf6a6e9897cac9dc74096a43e4f00370c": "Nadine Dorries has been a devout ally of Boris Johnson ever since she was appointed to cabinet - and this week is no different. The culture secretary confidently claimed a successful vote of no confidence in the prime minister's leadership was 'never going to happen', even as uneasiness in the Tory leader grows among the backbenchers. She told Sky News on Tuesday evening that Johnson can continue to command the public's trust, despite the ongoing turmoil within Tory ranks. It came No.10's ethics chief, Lord Geidt, questioned if the prime minister had broken the ministerial code himself as he received a fixed penalty notice for attending a lockdown party. Dorries explained: ''There has been an investigation via the Met Police, the prime minister has been to the House of Commons, he has apologised, humbly apologised, he has accepted the lessons that need to be learnt from the Sue Gray report, he has implemented most of the recommendations - and he has not misled the House of Commons. 'So yes, absolutely, the prime minister can survive.' Addressing the Tory MPs who have publicly criticised Johnson, she said: 'Look, 180 MPs are what would be needed to secure a vote of no confidence in the prime minister. That is never going to happen.' To successfully oust a prime minister, at least 15% of the sitting MPs in the leading party have to submit a letter of no confidence. In the case of the current sitting government, 54 letters from Tory MPs would have to be submitted to backbench chief, Sir Graham Brady. If that threshold is met, every MP in the Conservative Party would hold a vote of no confidence in Johnson. More than 50% of them would need to agree that the prime minister to go for the no confidence motion to go ahead. However, Dorries dismissed the senior Tories, such as former leadership candidate Andrea Leadsom and former Conservative leader William Hague who have voiced their frustration about the prime minister. She said their complaints were 'disappointing' but added Johnson still has 'the confidence of the country'. Dorries continued: 'I think there's a concerted effort to attempt to remove the prime minister for a number of reasons, but I do think it's disappointing. I think people should get behind the prime minister! 'People don't vote for divided parties.' She then said No.10 has been 'getting the big issues right' including the vaccine programme and Brexit, so people need to 'help him continue to deliver'.", "efc3d327407d63fca3b76ea9ab228b164048ec828d647dee87346dc9": "You can catch Covid multiple times - but according to a helpful graph shared on Instagram, reinfection usually only occurs after a certain number of months. Author Emily Oster, economics professor from Brown University, posted this useful graphic on her Instagram account, suggesting most people have 0% chance of reinfection the first three months after infection. Explaining her post in her Parent Data newsletter, Oster wrote: 'Reinfection is hard to measure reliably. It is getting harder because testing is getting less common and PCR testing even less so. Even if people rapid test at home, this may not get into an official system.' Not many people had access to tests during the first wave of Covid either, meaning many infections might have occurred without being registered. So, is it impossible to be reinfected in the first three months? Oster referenced the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) surveillance system for her graph, and concluded that for three months after infection, there was almost zero chance of catching the virus again. However, other experts suggested in January that the risk of reinfection might be considerably higher during those first three months for certain individuals, depending on which variant they were hit with and how long it has been since their vaccination. When the Omicron variant really began to take hold earlier in 2022, there were reports of people being reinfected just weeks later. What happens after those three months? After that, the ONS data found there was a 'slightly less than 1% on average chance of reinfection each month'. Over the course of six months, this translates to approximately 5% risk of reinfection. But, ONS has found this is higher among the unvaccinated and those with an asymptomatic first infection.  Similarly, Aubree Gordon, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan, told The Atlantic that she estimated each person would catch Covid again around every three years. She said: 'Barring some intervention that really changes the landscape, we will all get SARS-CoV-2 multiple times in our life.' This is roughly in line with how often people become reinfected with flu viruses and the seasonal colds which make a reappearance every winter. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) found between the start of the pandemic and April 1, 2021, there were 890,575 possible reinfections in England, of which more than 10,000 were potential third rounds. 'With the combination of being two years into the pandemic, a few rounds of antibody waning, two major wave of immune evasion by Delta and then Omicron, there's fairly rampant reinfection,' immunology professor from Imperial College London, Danny Altman, told the Guardian. How severe might each reinfection be? The severity of each subsequent reinfection has not followed a clear pattern so far, even as immunity grows due to the vaccine programme and natural transmission. Gordon did tell The Atlantic that in her own studies, second infections and post-vaccination infections appeared 'significantly less severe', and third or fourth infections could be barely noticeable. The viral load in reinfections also appeared to be lower than in primary infections, according to data from Paul Hunter, Professor in Medicine at the University of East Anglia. Again, the variant involved and a person's vaccination status needs to be taken into account. For instance, according to Imperial College London scientists, Omicron had a much higher risk of reinfection compared to Delta, but triggered less severe symptoms.", "f533e21ac7c34f3862faa533fcf64cb54e2f8f9853d0ddc5135b2f72": "Liam Payne has opened up about previous tensions with his former One Direction bandmates, claiming one member once threw him against a wall.  The singer recently appeared on Logan Paul's podcast Impaulsive, where he admitted he didn't always get on with the other members of the group when they were still active.  Asked who in the band was 'rowdy', Liam said: 'Louis [Tomlinson] was wild. He wanted to be wild. He's got this spirit.' Stating that Louis was his 'best mate now', he recalled: 'In the band we hated each other. Like, to come to blows hate each other, it was close.' Asked if any of the band had actually 'come to blows', Liam later said: 'I think it's well known in the band that I don't like taking shit. I made it very obvious, I'm not going to tell you how.  'There was one moment where there was an argument backstage and one member in particular threw me up a wall. So I said to him, 'If you don't remove those hands there's a high likelihood you'll never use them again'.' Liam said the unnamed member soon took his hands off him.  Later in the podcast, Liam discussed former member Zayn Malik, who left the band in 2014 prior to their hiatus the following year.  'There's many reasons why I dislike Zayn and there's many reasons why I'll always, always be on his side,' Liam said.  'You can always look at the man for where he is and say 'Whatever, that guy's a dick,' but at the end of the day once you understand what he's been through to get to that point and also if he even wanted to be there. I'm so misunderstood by myself more than anyone... I can't sit here and dick on him... I can't commend some of the things he's done, I can't be on his side for that.

Gemma is the daughter of British football legend Michael Owen, and will be one of 11 Islanders heading into the new villa when Love Island returns to our screens next week. Speaking to The Mirror ahead of her entrance, the 19-year-old admitted her dad wasn't exactly 'buzzing' about her appearance on the dating show. However, she insisted: 'He is very supportive in whatever I decide to do so he didn't have a massive tantrum or anything like that. He was pretty chilled. 'He said, 'You know how to behave. You just go and do it'. My mum's bit of advice was, 'Gem, remember to keep it classy'.' Gemma also said her parents 'trust me not to do anything to embarrass them', stating she probably wouldn't have sex in the villa for that reason. Asked whether she'd be revealing her dad's identity to her fellow Islanders, the dressage rider said: 'I don't think I'm going to go in there and be like oh my dad was a footballer because I'm not really that type of person. 'I think if they ask me what your parents do, then I'm not going to keep it a secret. I'd be honest and say, but it's definitely not something I'm going to go in there and go bragging it about.

Smug with inoculation, people couldn't help but show off the fact they'd been vaxxed and boosted. However, that trend has long declined - most of us have been double jabbed by now.  But many haven't received a subsequent booster. And new research shows a couple of jabs is better than just the original two.  You might be thinking 'well, duh', but many people stop at two, thinking they're totally protected.  But according to the largest study of its kind, conducted by The Chinese University of Hong Kong and published in the BMJ, three jabs provide the best protection against infection. So if that's got you convinced, you can book a booster appointment via the NHS website or you can check to see where a local walk-in site near you is.  Remember, this is a third booster, and not the spring jab which is being offered to people aged 75 years and over, those in care homes and those aged 12 years and over with a weakened immune system are being offered the spring booster. They are being offered another jab as Covid is more serious for older people and those with compromised immune systems.  The research used data of more than 100 million people around the world, taken using WHO databases, confirmed that the number of doses is key for immunity as opposed to just getting two of the same type (i.e Pfizer).  So, having two initial doses of AstraZeneca and then a Pfizer booster is still better than just having the initial two.  Researchers found that three doses of any mRNA vaccine appeared to be 96% effective in fighting non-severe Covid infections and 95% effective in reducing people needing hospital admissions.  The results were encouraging, especially for over 65s as it showed that a combination of any vaccine proved to provide the highest immunity.  The same was found for people with who were immunocompromised in the study - a third mRNA booster dose, of any type, provided the best protection.  However, no conclusion could be drawn on a booster combination on the effect of deaths resulting from Covid 19.  'An mRNA booster is recommended to supplement any primary vaccine course,' the researchers concluded. 'A homologous regimen (receiving three doses of the same vaccine) and heterologous (receiving a third dose that differs from those given as two primary doses)work comparably well in preventing Covid-19 infections, even against different variants.'  So if you haven't got your booster yet, you definitely should. You can even revive the trend of uploading a 'just boosted' post.", "fdd83dfbed56af64fd6fada236cb0745a3cb2dc4f591bf1d1d106a05": "Researchers have made a startling discovery beneath the waters off Western Australia. A meadow of sea grass stretching more than 110 miles long was actually a single plant that had spent the past 4,500 years cloning itself to carpet an area three times larger than Manhattan. The findings, published Wednesday in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, make the colony of Posidonia australis, or ribbon weed, the largest known plant on Earth, scientists said. Elizabeth Sinclair, a senior research fellow at the University of Western Australia and a lead author of the study, said her team has been testing seagrass meadows around Australia for genetic diversity for years to see how they respond to climate change. When her team visited an area known as Shark Bay, a relatively pristine landscape untouched by development, they went beneath the waves to collect samples of seagrass to see what types of plants were growing across the ocean floor.  The answer was one. 'It's quite bizarre when you think about it, there's this plant in one end of the bay and then you move 100 kilometres down to the other end and it's the same plant,' Sinclair said.  Her team hypothesised that thousands of years ago, a single seagrass seedling landed in the bay. It was particularly suited to survive in different oceanic environments due to its unusual genome. Most comparable plant offspring contain 50% of each parent's genes. But Posidonia australis has 100% from each parent, making it a polyploid, meaning it has double the usual number of chromosomes. 'Polyploid plants often reside in places with extreme environmental conditions, are often sterile, but can continue to grow if left undisturbed, and this giant seagrass has done just that,' Sinclair said in a statement. 'Even without successful flowering and seed production, it appears to be really resilient, experiencing a wide range of temperatures and salinities plus extreme high light conditions, which together would typically be highly stressful for most plants.' The ribbon weed has slowly grown through a series of runners -- like a normal turf lawn -- to stretch nearly 80 square miles. The researchers estimate its age at about 4,500 years, based on the species' size and growth rate. Like other delicate oceanic structures, namely corals, seagrass meadows are susceptible to climate change. A severe heat wave in 2010 and 2011 sparked widespread damage to the Shark Bay meadows, killing about a third of the seagrasses. Underwater meadows are also home to many different species and serve a key role in an area's biodiversity.  'You lose a plant that creates this whole environment and you lose all the biodiversity that goes with it,' Sinclair said, adding that the 2010-2011 event had calamitous effects. 'The turtles were going hungry, the dolphins weren't getting enough fish, the whole network is connected.' Although the ribbon weed has already begun to recover and spread since that event, Sinclair cautioned that climate change still poses a threat to region. She also noted that it was 'scary' how researchers had only just discovered the remarkable colony hiding beneath the waves, noting climate change could rip such species away before humans had a chance to discover them. 'It's scary because we might lose it before we find out about it,' Sinclair said. 'It might be gone before we even know.'", "955cdf3348a081d3e0b7bf98a3531b729f2c616ad660479aafcc824d": "After Obi-Wan Kenobi actor Moses Ingram revealed on social media the onslaught of racist harassment she's received since the Disney+ series premiered last week, the Star Wars franchise stepped up Monday to show support for Ingram.  Moses plays Reva Sevander, also known as the Third Sister, who is hunting Obi-Wan Kenobi for Darth Vader in the new series.  The Emmy-nominated actor shared on her Instagram the hateful messages fired at her from fans of the series, including atrocious messages using the N-word and claims that she's part of the show only as a 'diversity hire.' 'There's nothing anybody can do about this. There's nothing anybody can do to stop this hate,' Ingram said in a video posted to her Instagram story. 'I question my purposes in even being here in front of you saying that this is happening. I don't really know.' She spoke on the pain of being targeted by racist harassment and thanked supporters who have stuck by her: 'The thing that bothers me is this feeling inside of myself, that no one has told me, but this feeling that I have to shut up and take it, that I have to grin and bear it. And I'm not built like that. So, I wanted to come on and say thank you to the people who show up for me in the comments and the places that I'm not going to put myself. And to the rest of y'all, y'all weird.' The official social media accounts for Star Wars issued a statement late on Monday backing Moses against the abominable online attacks. 'We are proud to welcome Moses Ingram to the Star Wars family and excited for Reva's story to unfold. If anyone intends to make her feel in any way unwelcome, we have only one thing to say: we resist,' the statement said.  'There are more than 20 million sentient species in the Star Wars galaxy, don't choose to be a racist,' the message concluded. Other actors of colour in the franchise, including Kelly Marie Train and John Boyega, also experienced toxic and racist backlash from fans when they joined the cast.  Before Obi-Wan aired on Disney+, the Baltimore actor told The Independent that executives on the show cautioned her that racist 'Star Wars' trolls could be on the horizon.  'It was something that Lucasfilm actually got in front of and said, 'This is a thing that, unfortunately, likely will happen. But we are here to help you; you can let us know when it happens,'' Moses said at the time.  She added: ''Obi-Wan' is going to bring the most diversity I think we've ever seen in the galaxy before. To me, it's long overdue. If you've got talking droids and aliens but no people of color, it doesn't make any sense. It's 2022, you know. So we're just at the beginning of that change. But I think to start that change is better than never having started it.' Star Trek: Strange New Worlds actor Anson Mount also headed to social media on Tuesday to share his support for Ingram.  'This is Moses Ingram. She is a singular talent and a recent addition to the @starwars universe. She has also been targeted by racists pretending to be fans because her mere existence threatens a skewed, dystopian fantasy that selectively omits the likes of @therealbillydee and others. We, the Trek Family, have her back,' he wrote.

Polling expert Lord Hayward said the prime minister was 'in trouble' as an increasing number of Tory MPs submit letters of no confidence. Hayward said he knew of at least one Tory MP who had put a letter in and not admitted it publicly. He also said he thinks the number of letters will cross the threshold of 54 to trigger a vote of no confidence.   His comments are significant given his record of successfully predicting political change. The peer stunned the political establishment two weeks before the EU referendum in 2016 when he correctly declared the polls were wrong and that Britain would vote to leave. Hayward told Sky News: 'There are some, I know of one at least, who has put in a letter but has not said so publicly.  'It's a reasonable extrapolation that there are markedly more MPs who have put in letters than have actually said that they will do or said that they have done. 'So the number is definitely rising. When it will cross the line is good speculation. I think it will.  'If I was a plotter, I'd probably want it to go on for a while because it allows the conversations to take place longer, the by-elections on June 23, in Wakefield, in Tiverton and Honiton, will be key.  'If I was a Boris fan, I'd probably want it as quickly as possible to get it out of the way because 54 is relatively easy. 180 which is the number on a vote of confidence is a different matter.'   To mount a leadership challenge, 54 have to submit a letter to Sir Graham Brady who leads the 1922 committee of backbench Conservative MPs. Only Brady knows how many have submitted letters and he keeps it a secret until the threshold is reached.  Analysis by Sky News shows 41 MPs have publicly questioned Johnson's position, while 28 have confirmed they have sent in letters. Hayward said it was striking that a lot of the MPs who have admitted submitting letters recently had experienced local elections in their constituencies, adding: 'They have spent more time asking people for support on behalf of their councillors, their candidates, than other people. 'In the local elections, the Tories did reasonably in being a party of government against the Labour Party in the Midlands of the North. 'But they did far worse than expected in parts of London and in the southeast in the middle class, the what's described as the gravel drive, Waitrose shopping areas. 'And that has clearly unsettled MPs who had, with their associations, to go out and campaign and what we're seeing now is that feeding off the losses of May 5.' Asked if Johnson would lose a confidence vote, Hayward replied: 'That is very difficult to say. I think if it were held today, no he wouldn't.  'But there are these series of hurdles - we've got Lord Geidt's comments yesterday, which have come completely out of the blue nobody was expecting this to have happened and therefore the reset is not proving to be the calming experience that most people at No.10 and within the organisation behind Boris would actually have wanted it to.  'So there is the prospect, but it's worth remembering Theresa May won a vote of confidence, in theory that gave her another year, but she was out of office within seven months.' He said a vote of confidence, even if you win, is not a guarantee that you will continue as the party leader because losing support is an 'attritional process'. In order to oust him, 180 MPs would have to vote against Johnson in the confidence vote. If it gets to that stage, the odds are in the PM's favour with around 140 MPs on the 'payroll' alone including ministers and aides.

The presenter had attempted to ask the MP who he thought could succeed Sir Keir Starmer as Labour leader should he be issued with a fine over 'beergate' and step down.  Murray first responded by saying: 'Well, I think it's quite clear what Boris Johnson wants to do because the only defence he has left...' Richard interrupted, annoyed that Murray appeared to be dodging the question.  'Look, it's an incredibly uncomplicated question,' he said. 'If you don't want to answer it, that's fine!  'Just say 'don't ask me that question, Richard, I'm not going to answer it.' But the viewers at home can hear me ask a question and they can hear you give an answer to a question I haven't asked.' He then asked 'politely': 'If Sir Keir does step down, and it's a possibility, it's not in the realms of utter fantasy, if he does step down because of a fine, who do you think might take over? 'If you don't want to answer it, say you don't answer it, but don't give me an answer for a question I haven't asked. It's just rude.' Murray responded: 'Well, I think it's also rude to interrupt when I'm trying to answer the question because...' 'No, excuse me,' Richard interjected. 'I'm interrupting you sir because you're not answering the question and I will interrupt anyone of any party who doesn't answer the question because that's my job. 'The question is, and it's really simple and polite, who do you think might be the runners and riders to take over from Sir Keir Starmer. If you don't want to answer the question, tell me and we'll move on.' Murray then said: 'It's something we're not considering at the moment for the simple reason that we think the accusations that have been put to Keir Starmer in terms of beergate are false and he was abiding by the rules.' Police are currently investigating whether the party leader and his deputy Angela Rayner broke the law by eating curry in an MP's office with staff after a day of campaigning for the local elections in April 2021.

Stewart's upcoming film Crimes Of The Future, directed by David Cronenberg, follows a performance artist who undergoes surgery in front of an audience as part of his schtick. In the horror-meets-sci-fi picture, the Spencer star plays an investigative surgeon named Timlin who becomes transfixed with the artist's body in a dystopian world.  Much like many of Cronenberg's previous work such as The Fly and Shivers, his latest project contains graphic scenes that some critics just couldn't handle watching, including a controversial scene of a child autopsy.  Despite receiving backlash,   Kristen told Insider that she doesn't mind the walkouts or the questionable nature of the film.  She shared that she wasn't repulsed by the hair-raising contents of the movie and praised Cronenberg's body-horror films that can often make for 'difficult' viewing.  'Everyone loves to talk about how his movies are difficult to watch and it's fun to talk about people walking out of Cannes screenings,' the actor said.  Kristen opened up about why she resonates with the Canadian director's films.  'Every single gaping, weird bruise in his movies, it makes my mouth open. You wanna lean in toward it,' she said. 'And it never repulses me ever. The way I feel, it is through really visceral desire and that's the only reason we're alive. We're pleasure sacks.' The Twilight actor also pointed out that walkouts usually happen every year at Cannes. Regardless of the critics who couldn't stomach the visuals, the Cannes film still received a seven-minute standing ovation, according to CinemaBlend.

The deputy prime minister said he 'doubts' that even 40 no confidence letters have been submitted by his colleagues.  To mount a leadership challenge, 54 have to submit a letter to Sir Graham Brady who leads the 1922 committee of backbench Conservative MPs. Analysis by Sky News shows 41 MPs have publicly questioned Johnson's position, while 28 have confirmed they have sent in letters. When presenter Kay Burley asked if he expected a vote of confidence in the prime minister as early as next week, Raab replied: 'No. I just don't see...look allow me to just give you my view, I think the Westminster bubble and village whips this stuff up. 'I'm not saying it's not serious and significant but we dealt with all of those issues, the prime minister's dealt with all those issues. 'It does feel like a lot of commentary building up this issue when actually when I talk to MPs...they want to see us driving forward that agenda. 'To be honest with you, votes of no confidence, leadership contests, all of that, is yet more Westminster talking to itself not talking to the public, not talking to our constituents.'   When it was put to him at least 40 MPs wanted a leadership challenge, he replied: 'I don't know what the numbers are, I don't think anyone does. I doubt it's that high in terms of letters, but the truth is, I don't know. 'But the reality is there's over 350 Conservative MPs and I think that the overwhelming swathe of the party recognise what I'm saying, which is our constituents, the public, wants to get on with the job.' Westminster observers think it is increasingly likely that the threshold will be breached and a no confidence vote triggered. In 2018, when 48 letters were needed to trigger a vote over Theresa May's leadership, only 27 had gone public when the vote was called.

If it gets to that stage, the odds are in the PM's favour with around 140 MPs on the 'payroll' alone including ministers and aides.

Your favourite Instagram influencer can post about self-care all day, showing glamorous pictures of bubble baths and retreats. Leaders across the country can offer lip service on the need to address mental health. A company can send an email to its employees honouring Mental Health Awareness Month.  But true mental health changes look much different from that. An estimated 1 in 4 American adults lives with a mental health condition (and the number is similar in the UK, according to the Mind charity). The Covid-19 crisis has likely added to this figure, leading to what mental health experts colloquially call a second pandemic. Burnout, issues with alcohol, depression, anxiety, grief and more have touched millions of people over the past two years.  Children's mental health concerns have also been spiking, exacerbating an already bleak situation. This prompted the American Academy of Pediatrics and other medical groups to declare a national emergency in youth mental health. Top mental health experts know ways to address it. But making it happen - in a sea of dissenting political opinions, lack of funding, health care employee shortages and other obstacles - is much harder. Here are just a few of the actual changes mental health professionals say we need from inside ourselves, in our homes and across the country right now. Coping strategies from a younger age When did you first learn to deep-breathe your way through a stressful situation? Potentially not early enough, according to Reena B. Patel, a licensed educational psychologist, board-certified behaviour analyst and author of Winnie & Her Worries. Patel is teaching children as young as three how to compartmentalise problems and reduce anxiety through her own programmes - and she said many more educational systems like this need to exist. 'We need to be addressing ways to cope with everyday stressors at a young age. I get them as teenagers and it is so difficult because they have established poor coping mechanisms,' she says. 'Those teenagers become adults and then we've got this huge problem.' She wants parents to stop trying to 'save the day' for their toddlers, instead of helping them handle situations on their own with parental guidance. Another important change includes parents evaluating how they handle stress themselves, as kids are watching and learning from them. Social-emotional learning The current school structure doesn't align with how we live now, according to Bethany Cook, a licensed clinical psychologist in Chicago. Cook explains that the system was established for a agricultural not industrial society, and certainly not a wide mix of neurodivergent individuals, including those with mental health conditions such as ADHD. Implementing social-emotional learning - or SEL - for all schools, which would address kids' social, emotional, behavioural and mental health needs, would allow young people to better thrive in a learning environment.  According to Cook, SEL would include increased access to and education on mental health resources and strategies, from coping mechanisms like deep breathing to increased school staff training to handle social and emotional concerns. Currently, about three in four US schools teach SEL nationwide, according to an Education Week survey. Paid mental wellbeing days and better work flexibility Patel said both students and adults need mental health days that aren't tied to sick days in any way as well. '[Companies should] really separate that in HR policies, and almost praise individuals and reinforce them for taking time to reset,' she says, emphasising that employees shouldn't have to mask it under the pretence of illness or another excuse. 'It's not a day you're taking because you have a cold or a personal day because you are feeling extra tired. It's a day that you actually need to help individuals,' she explains, noting that it would also be ideal to provide resources or advice that may help a person's mental well-being. Other mental health based recommendations include moving to a four-day workweek, which Cook says is essential, along with job flexibility: 'Let people work when they want to work.' A media makeover Patel is encouraged to see celebrities, such as Selena Gomez and Ashley Judd, talking about mental health struggles publicly. She hopes other representations - like realistic commercials that depict what it's actually like to live with a mental health condition - will become more common, too.  People should see themselves in all types of media, Patel says, noting that some mental health commercials, for example, should have a picture of a mum running around with her kids rather than staring sadly out a window. Unrealistic beauty standards also come into play here. Cook adds that additional media-related issues revolve around unrealistic images: 'Can we just stop airbrushing models? They're not going to stop, I get it, but all of that impacts mental health.' Consumers can support companies that have pledged to stop airbrushing models and can also evaluate their own social media feeds to promote increased exposure to real bodies.  Following influencers who look like you can help rewire your brain to see your body for what it is - normal - and decrease the pressure to conform to something unhealthy.  Maternity leave and better childcare options The pandemic has revealed the plight of the lose-lose situation that parents, especially mothers, face on a daily basis. Part of the solution to relieving parents' mental health struggles, Cook says, is a minimum of one year of maternity leave (in the US, there is no mandate to offer paid leave) along with increased childcare options. She proposes placing them in or close to businesses where parents work. 'Parents need the bond and it's important for children to feel connected. And when the day care is close to where an individual works, they can on a break go and say hi, have access to their child, [check on] a runny nose... have lunch together,' she says. This would eliminate the issue of parents being 'forced to go back to work before they're ready' or thrusting a child into a day care environment too early. Additional day care reform ideas have included placing them in senior citizen centres for the emotional benefits to both the youngest and oldest Americans and federally funded health care to relieve financial burdens. Tackling systemic inequalities in housing, health care, food access and more Though people with mental health challenges might work hard to prevent and improve their conditions to the best of their abilities, systemic inequalities can make that difficult and even impossible.  Decreased access to housing, healthcare, food and more, greatly inhibits people's ability to address or improve their mental health. This certainly includes access to treatment, like therapy. Cook says there's a need for government-funded mental health facilities run by universities and research centres. Providing an accessible and reputable source for help can assist people in getting the care they really need.  Platitudes about taking care of yourself and prioritising your mind only go so far. We need real change - and access - to make a shift in people's mental health right now.", "f1c261b8b115708ca51ba411ed0646917b7997cd2c45f530f5d5164d": "  We hope you love the products we recommend!

Not only are case rates still high, we're seeing mental health implications. Therapists are just starting to unpack the last two years with their clients. Experts are working harder than ever trying to accommodate patients with spiking mental health concerns as a result of the ripple effects of Covid-19. In addition to grief, depression, anxiety and more, here are some of the themes they're commonly seeing in their sessions: Relationship struggles If you and your significant other have spent every day working, living and quarantining together for the better part of two years, you might have seen issues come to light that weren't there pre-pandemic. Josh Jonas, a psychotherapist in New York City at The Village Institute, says this is a common concern among people now. 'Relationships are very much suffering now that we've kind of gotten into this new normal of being around each other all the time... working from home. So now we get to the real difficult parts of relationships,' he explains. A regular theme he's seeing is some partners needing freedom and others not understanding why they're not feeling connected. The split of household labour, differing risk tolerances and other issues have also come up. Contradicting data shows that researchers aren't sure yet if the pandemic is causing divorce rates to soar or fall, but it's a trend we will know more about with time. Parents worried about their kids feeling off or behind The education gap for children in and out of classrooms, navigating virtual learning, and being left without their usual educational supports is apparent in therapy.  'With the kids, some of the biggest things we're seeing is general increased anxiety, depression, a lot of worry about school, and a lot of kids really got off track during COvid and do not feel like they've been able to recover,' says Dr Lateefah Watford, an Atlanta-based child psychiatrist through Kaiser Permanente. This is a particular challenge for students and their families who have always been 'high achievers,' who haven't really struggled academically before, she added. And it's not just academics - students who have missed major social milestones are grieving those losses, and feeling like the transition 'back to normal' is abrupt. Lara Goodrich, a psychologist in Madison, Connecticut, says that teenagers especially missed major milestones in high school or secondary school, then were thrust into the university scene unprepared.  'Pretty much all of them have reflected on what it was like to have this loss of their later years of high school... many of them feel like they're behind in their emotional and social maturity as college students,' she says. Perpetual uncertainty People often reminisce or talk about that fateful day in March 2020 when everything shut down. The shift out of normal life o without notice and indefinitely - is still being discussed in therapists' offices.  Goodrich said that unmasking is causing a similar feeling, triggering people who were very comfortable masking to again sense that anything can change in an instant. 'It was like a sudden shift where it felt like things change on a dime,' she says. 'And then they found themselves needing to make some really tough decisions about how they operated in the world [after mask mandates lifted].'  This sense of uncertainty causes people to make decisions out of fear, a trend she is seeing. 'I try to help somebody separate their thoughts and emotions apart from things that are being driven by fear - [those] aren't decisions that necessarily hold water long-term for us, as they tend to be reactive or impulsive,' she said, adding that while pandemic-based fears are valid, people are struggling to shift to other decision-making processes now. Anxiety around money, career shifts and burnout The last two years have led to a career reckoning. For 9.5 million people, regaining jobs lost during the early pandemic months wasn't immediate, nor was it easy. Others grappled with burnout. Many struggled to make ends meet.  One group who experienced much of this is healthcare workers. Watford says many of her healthcare clients are starting to cut their hours where possible due to sheer exhaustion. Watford adds that there can also be feelings that come up returning to an office that is far from 'business as usual.' The risk of Covid when returning to work and interacting with others can be a source of anxiety. For those who never left in-person work, these fears have been prevalent for quite some time and will continue to be. Finally, Watford notes that governmental support during the pandemic was, for some, 'better than what they would get breaking their back at jobs that pay minimum wage.' When that disappeared, it caused many people to have to balance their family's basic health and food security needs with the 'reality of working 80-90 hours per week.' This continues to be a source of stress and there's a real need for reform. 'We have to recognise that I think there are jobs, but I don't know that the jobs are the same anymore,' Watford explains.

'Even if you don't think you exactly fit into the box of depression, don't keep suffering,' Goodrich said.

Lord Geidt, the independent adviser on the ministerial code, said a 'legitimate question' had arisen as to whether the fixed penalty notice issued by the Metropolitan Police might have constituted a breach of the 'overarching duty within the ministerial code of complying with the law'. Here's the row explained: What is the ministerial code? The code is the rules and principles which lay out the standards of conduct expected from every government minister. There are different codes for the government in Westminster, and in each of the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. All four of them set out the 'overarching duty' of ministers to follow the law and the ethical standards called the Seven Principles of Public Life - these include openness, integrity, honesty and accountability. Why is Johnson in trouble? The prime minister was issued with a fixed penalty notice over a birthday party thrown in his honour in the Cabinet Room in June 2020 at a time when indoor socialising was banned. The Met's Operation Hillman inquiry into events in No 10 and Whitehall has now concluded, with the PM receiving no further fines. Last week, Sue Gray's partygate report painted a debauched picture of booze-fuelled lockdown partying into the early hours, cleaners having to scrub red wine off the walls, a fight between staff, and a karaoke machine at the ready. But the PM has refused to step down since its publication, despite pressure from his own MPs. Johnson said he takes 'full responsibility for everything that took place on my watch', but that he had no idea some gatherings went on until the early hours and that he was 'surprised and disappointed' by some of the revelations.  But he's not out the woods. The Commons privileges committee's investigation into whether the prime minister misled parliament looms. On multiple occasions, in parliament, Johnson denied knowledge of any rule breaking in No.10.   The ministerial code states that 'ministers who knowingly mislead parliament will be expected to offer their resignation'. The key word there is 'knowingly' - Johnson's defence has been that he did not think anything he did broke the laws that he had imposed on the country.  What happened last week? Johnson was, two days after the Gray report, accused of watering down the code after the government said it was being updated. The update makes clear that ministers will not necessarily have to resign for more minor violations. Instead the prime minister will have the option of imposing a lesser sanction such as 'some form of public apology, remedial action or removal of ministerial salary for a period'. Johnson has also rewritten the foreword to the code. He removed any wording related to honesty, integrity, transparency and accountability. Crucially, he also blocked his independent ethics chief - Lord Geidt as it currently stands - from gaining the power to launch their own investigations. Chris Bryant, the Labour MP who chairs the privileges committee, said: 'If you break the rules just rewrite the rule book is the motto of this despicable government.' What's Lord Geidt said? On Tuesday, Lord Geidt said there is a 'legitimate question' about whether Johnson broke the ethics rules when he was fined by the police. In his preface to his latest annual report, he said he had repeatedly told the prime minister to 'take responsibility for his own conduct' by publicly explaining why he thought incurring a fixed penalty notice would not be in breach of the code of conduct for ministers. 'That advice has not been heeded,' Lord Geidt added. Lord Geidt warned it may be 'especially difficult to inspire that trust' in the rules for ministers 'if any prime minister, whose code it is, declines to refer to it'. The key section of his comments state:  'In the case of the fixed penalty notice recently issued to and paid by the prime minister, a legitimate question has arisen as to whether those facts alone might have constituted a breach of the overarching duty within the ministerial code of complying with the law.   'It may be that the prime minister considers that no such breach of his ministerial code has occurred.   'In that case, I believe a prime minister should respond accordingly, setting out his case in public. This matters to the integrity of the independent adviser who, otherwise, might until recently have had to seek a prime minister's consent to make inquiries into a prime minister's conduct.'  In one section of the report, written in classic civil servants' language, Lord Geidt essays what he calls the code becoming 'a place of ridicule' - where the independent advisor can't criticise a prime minister unless the prime minister criticises themselves first. Lord Geidt also suggests he might quit if not permitted to launch his own probes. He writes: 'I have attempted to avoid the independent adviser offering advice to a prime minister about a prime minister's obligations under his own ministerial code. 'If a prime minister's judgment is that there is nothing to investigate or no case to answer, he would be bound to reject any such advice, thus forcing the resignation of the independent adviser. 'Such a circular process could only risk placing the ministerial code in a place of ridicule.' How did Johnson respond?  Johnson said in a letter to Lord Geidt that the fine 'did not breach' the ministerial code as there was 'no intent to break the law'. He said his reasoning for this view included that there have been 'past precedents of ministers who have unwittingly breached regulations where there was no intent to break the law'. The prime minister said he had complied with the code's requirements by correcting statements to parliament denying that there had been parties at his residence. He said they had been delivered 'in good faith' but turned out to be untrue. Johnson said that Lord Geidt had not directly raised with him the need for a statement on his compliance with the code and blamed a 'failure of communications' between their two offices.

The Labour leader has pledged to resign if issued a fixed penalty notice over the so-called beergate row. Police are investigating whether the party leader and his deputy broke the law by eating curry in an MP's office with staff after a day of campaigning for the local elections in April 2021. Starmer has said the accusation made against him was entirely different from the 'industrial rule breaking' taking place in Downing Street. Boris Johnson has been issued one fine for breaking his own Covid rules, and has rebuffed demands that he step down as prime minister despite pressure following the publication of the Sue Gray report last week.   A Labour Party spokesperson said: 'Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner have received questionnaires from Durham Constabulary.' At the time of the Durham gathering, non-essential retail and outdoor venues including pub gardens were open, but social distancing rules - which included a ban on indoor mixing between households - remained in place. But Labour has argued that food was consumed between work events, meaning it was within the rules. Earlier this month, Durham Constabulary announced they had reversed an earlier decision that no offence had been committed, after receiving 'significant new information'. Labour sources are confident they can prove the Durham event was work-related and that those present were taking a break to eat while working late on preparations for the Hartlepool by-election.", "e08fac2ece0accf0ca89e1e0c473296ba83b355e3b04908f605f4a76": "The Archbishop of Canterbury has suggested Prince Andrew is 'seeking to make amends' after settling his sex abuse case as the head of the Church of England urged the nation to be more 'open and forgiving'. Archbishop Justin Welby said the Queen was 'fully entitled' to have been accompanied by Andrew at Prince Philip's memorial service in March, despite public criticism. A month earlier, the prince reached an out-of-court settlement regarding a sexual assault lawsuit filed against him by accuser Virginia Giuffre. Financial terms were not disclosed but it has been widely reported to be a multi-million dollar settlement. Giuffre accused the Duke of York of sexually assaulting and abusing her when she was a minor in the early 2000s. In an interview with ITV News presenter Tom Bradby, he was asked if this weeked's Jubilee celebrations offer an opportunity to forgive the Duke of York. He said: 'There's a difference between consequences and forgiveness. 'I think for all of us, one of the ways that we celebrate when we come together is in learning to be a more open and forgiving society. 'Now with Prince Andrew, I think we all have to step back a bit. He's seeking to make amends and I think that's a very good thing. 'But you can't tell people how they're to respond about this. And the issues of the past in the area of abuse are so intensely personal and private for so many people. 'It's not surprising there's very deep feelings, indeed.' Amid the fall-out from the civil sex case, the Queen stripped the Duke of York of his honorary military roles and he gave up his 'HRH' style. It represented Andrew's complete removal from official royal life, and an attempt to distance the monarchy from the Duke, who was once second in line to the throne as the spare to the heir, in the year of the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. But Andrew's withdrawal from the public eye came to an end when he unexpectedly attended the Duke of Edinburgh's memorial service in March, with his mother on his arm. It is expected that Andrew will join the Queen at her Service of Thanksgiving on Friday - but he is not expected to appear on the Buckingham Palace balcony following the Trooping the Colour on Thursday.", "5cd0a90891b93b0dfba1f0a922f6187f33bd7e6a4129ea2b4480455f": "", "cc6d941cbd6dc66cfcd6e770a8ce068d5b82470ace527902343a95de": "Tom Cruise didn't feel the need for speed when director Joseph Kosinski pitched him Top Gun: Maverick -- and it took a desperate 30-minute meeting to convince him otherwise, the director said. Kosinski told Polygon in an interview that he and producer Jerry Bruckheimer flew to Paris to convince Tom to dust off the franchise while he was shooting a Mission: Impossible movie. 'We got about a half-hour of his time between setups. And I basically had 30 minutes to pitch this film, which I didn't realise when we were flying over. But when I got there, I found that Tom really didn't want to make another Top Gun.' So Kosinski pitched under extreme pressure, emphasising the character-driven aspect of the movie that 'leveraged the emotion' of the original. He emphasised the heavy responsibility Tom's character Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell felt for the lives of other pilots under his tutelage. 'It's one of those moments as a director, you have one on every film, where you're on the spot to make a case for why this movie should be made. I had 30 minutes to do it,' Kosinski recalled. 'And at the end of the pitch, he picked up the phone, he called the head of Paramount Pictures and said, 'We're making another Top Gun.' It's pretty impressive to see the power of a real movie star in that moment.' It appears to be a good decision.

The bank holiday also comes at a particularly difficult time for many households, with the current cost of living crisis squeezing everyone's budgets. So, here's a breakdown of all the costs and along with an estimate of just how much money it will bring in.  How much are we spending? Money from the taxpayer Chancellor Rishi Sunak has funnelled PS28 million of taxpayers' money into the celebrations, according to the March 2021 budget. The government has promised a 'once-in-a-generation show' mixing 'the best of British ceremonial splendour and pageantry with cutting-edge artistic and technological displays' to honour the occasion. This includes the Queen's birthday parade (Trooping The Colour), the PS15 million Platinum Jubilee Pageant and the BBC's Platinum Party at the Palace. This money has also been split among several different projects, including the PS3 million fund to support village hall improvement projects for over 100 different venues. The government is pumping PS12 million into new books for primary school children called 'Queen Elizabeth: A Platinum Jubilee Celebration' too, although it's not clear if this part of the PS28 million announced by Sunak or an additional fund. While this may seem like a large amount, for comparison, Sunak recently announced a much heftier PS22 billion towards helping with the astronomical energy bills - on top of the previous PS15 billion fund. Input from charities On a more local level, charities have stepped up to contribute to the special occasion so that communities can mark the Jubilee. Here's a breakdown of the main foundations taking part, according to the government's official Jubilee page.   National Lottery Community Fund's platinum jubilee fund is offering grants of up to PS50,000 to 70 community projects   There are PS10,000 grants being offered in the National Lottery Awards for All programme for all 2022 events   Arts Council Englands is offering grants up to PS10,000   The Arts Council has announced PS175,000 towards libraries, to help them celebrate   UK National Archive is offering PS30,000 to help the archive sector honour the Queen   National Lottery Heritage PS7 million fund to help natural green spaces flourish   What about the subsequent economic boost? One of the most well-known arguments for keeping the Royal Family is how much money they bring in - and with a celebration of this magnitude, it's expected to be profitable. According to VisitEngland, the Jubilee weekend may bring in up to PS1.2 billion to the economy which would significantly counteract the amount spent on it. Consumers are expected to spend PS408 million over the four-day weekend, with PS281.5 million alone going on souvenirs, memorabilia and gifts, the Centre for Retail Research claimed. VisitEngland also claimed 5.3 million people plan to take an overnight break during the bank holiday weekend, offering a boost to hotels and B&Bs through domestic tourism. More than 12 million people also plan to take part in the celebrations - this includes eating out, street parties and watching events on outdoor screens, while licensing hours will be relaxed and extended until 1am, which will boost sales. However, estimates can also be offset by the weather, consumer confidence, business confidence, domestic and international tourism, as the government pointed out in its own assessment. According to VisitEngland's domestic trip tracker, 30% of UK adults are also waiting to see if they will be able to afford celebrating. So, what is the net outcome? These optimistic predictions would suggest that the profits will far outweigh the amount spent. However, the department for digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS)'s impact assessment for the extended weekend suggested otherwise. It notes that the 2002 Golden Jubilee saw GDP as a whole drop by 2.2% month-on-month, and the 2012 Diamond Jubilee saw a 1.5% drop in monthly GDP. Prior to the pandemic, these were the two largest monthly decreases since 1997. This comes down to the extended four-day bank holiday, which reduces output temporarily and sees the majority of businesses close for the celebration. And that's not all. In its summary, the DCMS claimed: 'A best estimate for the final monetised impact is -PS2.39 billion net present value for a Platinum Jubilee bank holiday in 2022. 'While the upper bound net present value is estimated to be -PS2.21 billion, the lower bound net present value is estimated to be -PS2.57 billion.' The impact assessment was published in April 2021, before the cost of living crisis really started to bite in April this year. Such financial difficulties where millions of UK adults have admitted to skipping a meal at least once a day may reduce the amount consumers are willing to spend over the bank holiday. In an optimistic twist, the DMCS did predict there would be a 'bounce-back' effect in the next quarter after the celebratory weekend, 'as has been observed in previous Jubilee years'. The report then emphasised: 'It is therefore important to consider the impact of the bank holiday on output over both Q2 and Q3 for 2022 rather than the impacts on monthly GDP.'", "6004dd9d38403710c9aee2d96d86eba203e59575f89c2cc340704199": "", "14a9ba454a2195cc23fa21eb4fb93723e066fca8f01c1279a03601fa": "Vladimir Putin's blockade of Black Sea ports will push millions across the world into starvation, a Ukrainian MP warned today.  Kira Rudik, leader of the opposition liberal Golos party, said countries reliant on Ukraine's cereals face famine unless Russia's blockade is lifted. Kyiv has accused Russia of blockading agricultural exports from Ukraine, known as the 'breadbasket of Europe'. Nearly all of the country's grain exports are sat in storage - threatening the lives of millions of people and contributing to a global food crisis. Rudik also warned Brits that their cost of living crisis was 'directly related' to the war in Ukraine, in an exclusive interview with HuffPost UK. 'As of today, the world has 10 weeks of grain supplies,' she said. 'So it puts a hard deadline on what needs to happen on unblocking the ports.' Asked what will happen if the food cannot get out soon, she replied: 'Famine. Famine in some of the African countries. Russia took a lot of our grain and they will try to sell it and probably will be successful in that. 'But it will not cover it. Before the war Ukraine was in the top three world producers of wheat, grains, sunflower oil. The first question people are ask me when I'm here in the UK, is where is the sunflower oil?  'I can tell you where sunflower oil is, it's in Ukraine, blocked. So are tomatoes and corn.  'The upcoming issue that we're facing is that right now 85 per cent of the plants have been sown.  'So in Autumn we will have another harvest but we don't have fuel to actually collect it. And we will not have fuel to move it anywhere.' Asked if she believed Putin was willing to let people starve, she replied: 'Is there any sense that he'll be supporting otherwise? 'It's a part of his strategy, it's part of his propaganda when he's saying that Ukraine wants to starve the world. He's saying 'it's not on us'.' Her stark warning echoes that of the UK's Ministry of Defence which said Russia was prepared to leverage global food security for its own political aim. 'Russia has demonstrated is it prepared to leverage global food security for its own political aim and then present itself as the reasonable actor and blame the west for any failure,' they said. Meanwhile, David Beasley, head of the World Food Programme, warned the UN that failure to open ports in Odesa would be a 'declaration of war on global food security'. 'This is not just about Ukraine, this is about the poorest of the poor around the world who are on the brink of starvation as we speak,' he added.  Rudik said she believed Putin will continue his mission to recreate a 'Greater Russia' and described his strategy as a 'salami technique' slicing away at Ukraine. She said it was on the west to stop him, adding: 'He's playing a game of chess and the western world is playing second hand right now.  'Putin is leading the strategy and making the world respond. There isn't an active idea from anybody who calls themselves a leader.' The MP said the UK's cost of living crisis was 'directly related' to what was happening in Ukraine and called on Brits to put pressure on the government. 'I want you to remember that right now, all the struggles and hurdles economically are all related and the result of the war in Ukraine,' she said. 'So every time you don't see the sunflower oil in your store, it is because our ports are blocked. Every time that you see your energy bill going up, it is the result of the war in Ukraine and Putin. 'In Autumn, which I believe will be harder and worse if the cost of living goes up, it's also the result of war in Ukraine. 'At some point everybody will start asking this question of how do we get to the end? And I can tell you that there is no way of getting to the end other than winning this war for Ukraine. 'We intend to fight to the end. We are not giving up our soil, but the whole world will suffer and it's actually on the world how long that suffering will last.' Rudik also anticipates that Putin will use energy 'as a weapon' and added: 'We're getting closer and closer to the heating season in Europe and if we think that Putin is a nasty bastard right now, guess what will happen when it's cold outside and it's an illusion hoping that he will become more negotiable.' On the second day of the war in Ukraine, Rudik was pictured holding a Kalashnikov rifle, saying she was prepared to use it to defend Kyiv. 'Our women will protect our soil the same way as our men,' she wrote. Asked about the impact the war was having on her personally, she described a recent visit to Poland when she went jogging. 'There was an ambulance passing by with a siren on and I realised that I'm laying on the ground with my hands covering my head.  'I didn't even realise. I came up to my senses when I was already there [on the ground].' Asked if she thought it was PTSD, Rudik replied: 'Yeh, I will be fine. I'm a grown-up woman, I am firm, I'm a strong woman, I'm a politician, I have seen stuff.  'So it's somewhere deep inside made this trauma that we'll have to fix.  'Probably realising it and understanding it is the first step but, can you imagine, the whole population has been traumatised to the point they know not to trust that their home can be permanent. 'We have so many traumatised children I cannot begin to tell you, starting from the physical impact to the psychological one.' Rudik said she plays a game of 'turtle' with her children when they hear air raid sirens they get on the floor, cover their ears and pretend to be a turtle. Another game they play is making butterfly shapes on their windows with tape - which prevents the glass shattering everywhere during a bomb blast.  The party leader is in the UK for a few days where she is meeting MPs in London and Scotland. Her main objective is to call for the powerful M270 rocket system, a strategy to unblock the ports and visas for Ukrainian refugees.  She also said she was worried the world was losing interest in Ukraine, adding: 'Psychologically people tend to grow numb to other people suffering.  'You get used to bombarding, to air raid sirens, the same way you get used to people being killed every single day and this is terrible. 'This is something that we should be psychologically aware of. This should not continue happening.' Asked what her message was to ordinary Brits, she replied: 'Thank you. This has been such an amazing time - when people we don't know and have never met - have opened their homes for us. I'm so grateful for that.'", "fcc106ccdb3db876643b719ed3272ec7ea04a0add0d997f5c52d7762": "  We hope you love the products we recommend! All of them were independently selected by our editors.

The 62-year-old Oscar-winning actor is facing four charges of sexual assault against three men, as well as causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) previously said. In cases such as this, the person concerned can choose to return to face charges, but, if this does not happen, prosecutors could seek to start extradition proceedings.   In a statement released to Good Morning America on Tuesday, Spacey is quoted as saying: 'I very much appreciate the Crown Prosecution Service's statement in which they carefully reminded the media and the public that I am entitled to a fair trial, and innocent until proven otherwise. 'While I am disappointed with their decision to move forward, I will voluntarily appear in the UK as soon as can be arranged and defend myself against these charges, which I am confident will prove my innocence.' The alleged incidents took place in London between March 2005 and August 2008, and in Gloucestershire in April 2013. The CPS authorised the charges following a review of the evidence gathered by the Metropolitan Police in their previous investigation into the actor.   Rosemary Ainslie, head of the CPS Special Crime Division, said: 'The CPS has authorised criminal charges against Kevin Spacey, 62, for four counts of sexual assault against three men. 'He has also been charged with causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent.

It takes 54 Tory MPs to formally submit a letter for a no confidence vote in Johnson to be triggered. In a letter on Tuesday, reported by The Mirror, Leadsom said she wanted to be 'clear' about her views but stopped short of calling for Johnson to resign or offering him continued support. 'I believe in the importance of high standards of integrity, and that Members of Parliament must strive to be good role models, very specifically because we are the lawmakers and therefore in a trusted position of power and authority,' she said. 'I am determined to be clear about my views as a matter of personal integrity -- the conclusion I have drawn from the Sue Gray report is that there have been unacceptable failings of leadership that cannot be tolerated and are the responsibility of the prime minister. 'Each of my Conservative MP colleagues and I must now decide individually on what is the right course of action that will restore confidence in our government.' Leadsom has served in a number of senior government roles including business secretary and Commons leader. She ran against Johnson in both the 2016 and 2019 Conservative leadership elections.  Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tories, is the only person who knows the number of letters that have been sent in. It is widely expected in Westminster that Brady would wait until parliament returns from the current recess next Monday, after the Queen's Jubilee celebrations, before revealing whether the threshold had been met.", "cdf2cedba42497313ca383e412974386f13592bd8735a3c458ff353c": "The 'fuse is getting closer to the dynamite', William Hague warned on Tuesday. The explosion the former Tory leader is expecting, is a no confidence vote in Boris Johnson's leadership. It could come as soon as next week. How is a no confidence vote triggered? To mount a leadership challenge, 15% of Conservative MPs have to submit a letter. Based on the current size of the party in the Commons, this means 54 Tory MPs have to get out their pens. At the time of publication, an analysis by Sky News showed 40 MPs had publicly questioned Johnson's position, with 27 having confirmed they have sent in letters. The number of letters could be higher than the number known in public, as there is no obligation for MPs to reveal if and when they have handed one in. The letters are secretly sent to Sir Graham Brady. The veteran Tory MP leads the body of all backbench Conservative MPs known as the 1922 committee. Only Brady knows how many letters he has received. In 2018, when MPs mobilised to oust Theresa May, Brady said he did not even tell his wife how many he had locked in his safe. If and when 54 letters are delivered, a no confidence vote in Johnson would be held. Depending what time the threshold is reached, this could even happen on the same day. All 360 Tory MPs would vote in a secret ballot, if more than 50% vote against Johnson he would be removed as leader. But if the rebels fail to reach that threshold Johnson would get to keep his job. It is entirely plausible that the 54 number has already been reached. But it is widely expected in Westminster that Brady would wait until parliament returns from recess on Monday, after the Queen's jubilee, to make any announcement. What happens if he survives the vote? If Johnson wins the no confidence vote, party rules mean another could not be held for another year. This happened in December 2018 when Tory MPs botched an attempt to get rid of May. She ultimately managed to cling on to the leadership until June 2019. Johnson's authority would be hugely damaged even if he did win. But it would inoculate him against another formal challenge immediately after the two by-elections on June 23, which the Conservatives could very well lose. What happens if he loses the vote? If Johnson loses the no confidence vote then a leadership contest is triggered. He is not allowed to stand for re-election as leader but would likely stay in post until his successor is chosen. How does the leadership election work Conservative Party leadership elections have two parts. The first stage sees Tory MPs vote in a series of rounds, whittling the list of candidates down to a final two. In the 2019 leadership race this took roughly two weeks. The second stage sees the final two candidates go to a vote of Tory members. In 2019, when Johnson took on Jeremy Hunt, this took around a month. Leadership candidates are already seen to be on manoeuvres in Westminster in the expectation of a contest.  If Tory MPs do successfully move against Johnson soon, it would mean a new prime minister would be in place well in time for the party's annual conference in October. The new leader would have until January 2025 before they had to call a general election.", "be1fb767698c9dd8a6b5689ad7c1ecfa264ab840bde82b54bfb6687d": "Petrol prices in the UK have just risen once again adding to the already tense cost of living crisis. The cost of filling up your vehicle has shot up since the EU confirmed its latest set of sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. The UK may no longer be in the bloc but this has a knock-on effect for our petrol pumps. Here's everything you need to know. Petrol prices are on the rise Fuel prices have been rising steadily over recent weeks, as the supply cannot keep up with the demand. To fill a 55-litre family vehicle with unleaded petrol now costs PS95.16, the vehicle insurance company RAC has claimed, meaning it currently costs 173.02p per litre. And these numbers are unlikely to drop any time soon. The RAC predicted that the current global oil price of $122 (PS96.89) means the average price of an unleaded litre might rise to 185p. The average price of diesel is also expected to rise to 190p per litre. Why is this happening? The recent rise is down to the EU's decision to impose its sixth set of sanctions against Russia on Monday. President of the European Council Charles Michel tweeted that this new agreement for the 27 EU nations 'immediately covers more than 2/3 of oil imports from Russia, cutting a huge source of financing for its war machine' and reducing the funds the Kremlin has for its attack on Ukraine. Officials believe this will cut off 70% of the Russian oil immediately by halting tankers, and that more than 90% of Russian oil sales will eventually cease as a result of this policy. The plan currently does not include oil transfers by pipelines, but European diplomats say this could also stop soon. Oil (and gas exports) pump serious money into Russia's economy, so this new decision is a big deal for Moscow. But it's also significant for the bloc - more than a quarter of the EU's imported oil came from Russia last year. Between the start of the war in February and the beginning of April, Europe actually increased the amount of fuel it bought from Russia. It comes after increasing pressure from Ukraine for the west to up its sanctions against Russia and cut off oil and gas supplies. How the EU's oil supplies impacts the UK The UK has already promised to phase out imports of Russian oil by the end of the year, even though it accounts for only 8% of UK demands in total. However, this move from EU still affects Britain's supplies. The UK gets the rest of its oil supplies from the North Sea and Norway, along with some exports from the US, Canada, the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium and Saudi Arabia. But, with limited access to the third largest oil producer in the world, Russia, other countries are tightening their grip around their own supplies - meaning the UK has access to less oil overall. As the RAC's fuel spokesperson Simon Williams pointed out to Sky News, the EU's decision therefore has a knock-on effect for the UK's cost of living crisis. He said: 'The EU's decision to ban the majority of Russian oil imports will cause the barrel price to go higher still, spelling yet more misery for fuel prices in the UK. 'The wholesale price of petrol has already been increasing due to the increased summer driving demand which means we are likely to see average forecourt prices for petrol climb to 180p a litre in a matter of days.' The cost of living crisis has already pushed inflation in the UK to its highest level in 40 years, at 9%, with prices only expected to continue rising in the coming weeks.", "c77423bb33178a8bf401c82a2028f5e9c450df98232dfe79cbea329e": "So you're trying to travel right now. If you've been on social media and seen the news then you'll know that it's in chaos right now.  Long queues, flight delays and luggage problems have been plaguing the UK's airports lately as half term and Platinum Jubilee bank holidays have increased the number of people hoping to head abroad. There's also ongoing passport delays that are leaving plans in disarray.  So here's what to know about travel right now, including how to get flight compensation if you've been delayed or your flight has been cancelled. What's happening at airports? Tui has just announced that it will cancel six flights a day until the end of June, due to ongoing staff shortages at Manchester Airport.  EasyJet cancelled 240 flights over the weekend and with further cancellations expected, you can imagine the chaos that it's causing. Those travelling from Gatwick to Belfast were told at 4am on Tuesday morning their trip wouldn't be leaving. The 5am flight from Bristol to Amsterdam was axed at 2am. British Airways has also cancelled some flights.  What's behind delays and cancellations? During school and public holiday periods, the number of flights taken do surge, but with Covid restrictions lifted at many destinations, and people's fervour for travel, the demand has been too high for post-lockdown systems to cope. Airlines don't have enough staff and have struggled to recruit more. In some cases, such as a recent TUI flight from Manchester to Heraklion, there haven't been enough staff to load baggage. Despite the flight being close to take off, bags hadn't been loaded quickly enough. One flight attendant even decided to disembark to help load suitcases. Demand is also fuelled by people using coupons and credit saved up from previously cancelled trips. Additionally, this is the first half term holiday since the lifting of all restrictions in England and Wales.  What's going on with passports? There's an ongoing passport crisis, caused by a huge demand in applications for renewal, after five million people delayed getting theirs during the pandemic.  Now, since Covid restrictions have lifted, millions are rushing to get their documents renewed, but facing lengthy waiting times to get them back.   Where it would previously take three weeks for a new passport to arrive, the wait time has increased to 10 weeks. However, not everyone is receiving theirs within this timeframe - with some report waiting months for theirs to arrive. Post-Brexit travel rules that say Brits need to have at least three months remaining before their passport expires also complicate the process.  So if you're planning to go away in the next few months make sure your passport is up to date - in rare cases, applications can be expedited.  How to claim money if your flight is delayed According to Citizen's Advice, if your flight is delayed for long enough, your airline has to give you:   food and drink   access to phone calls and emails   accommodation if you're delayed overnight - and journeys between the airport and the hotel   But there are restrictions on how long a delay has to be for you to be able to claim compensation. This depends on the distance of the flight and the countries it's flying between. You can check the flight distance of your jouney on the WebFlyer website. You will receive more compensation if your flight is delayed between three to five hours or more.  As Citizen's Advice explains, you can claim up to PS520 in compensation if the delay is the airline's fault, depending on the distance and destination of your flight, and how late it arrived. It might have been your airline's fault if there was a technical problem, or they overbooked. You're unlikely to get compensation if the delay was because of something outside the airline's control, like bad weather or a security risk. If your flight is cancelled you should get a full refund and a replacement flight to get you to your destination. Speak to airport staff about your options.  Make sure you also take out travel insurance with a built in Covid policy in case you do catch it while you are away on your trip. What's the latest on Covid testing for travel? While the UK has lifted travel restrictions, other countries have their own Covid-19 rules. Before you travel you should check the 'entry requirements' section of foreign travel advice for all countries you will visit or travel through.  Don't forget some countries, such as Italy, only accept certains mask on airlines and public transport, for instance N95s.", "85421d0c2d15e2047c0107ac04d760a0b92324355dea5c3586fa4fcc": "Bradley Cooper is looking decidedly unlike Bradley Cooper in his latest film role.  The Hollywood actor is unrecognisable in character for Netflix feature Maestro. Bradley was seen sporting grey hair and appearing to wear prosthetics as conductor and composer Leonard Bernstein.  The A Star Is Born actor is playing the lead role in the new biopic about the musician behind works such as West Side Story. The film tells the complex love story between Bernstein and Felicia Cohn Montealegre.  Throughout their romance, which spanned more than 30 years, they had two engagements, a 25-year marriage and three children, as Bernstein tried to come to terms with his sexuality. Maestro also stars Carey Mulligan as Bernstein's wife Felicia.  Bradley has also written the screenplay, and is serving as a producer and director on the film. He made his directorial debut on A Star is Born, which he also starred in opposite Lady Gaga, with the film going on to receive eight Oscar nominations, six Grammy nominations and five Golden Globes nominations.

Self-care! Treat yo' self! Down time! Digital detox! Yoga retreat! Therapy! These buzzwords have become part and parcel of the everyday vernacular. With more focus than ever on personal wellbeing, it's easy to get sucked into the individualistic approach to holistic health.  But what's often missed in these conversations is the material conditions of each individual - how can people on low pay, from marginalised backgrounds, perhaps with precarious citizenship, enjoy these same luxuries? The activities that are touted as propelling people out of burn out, mental lows, and the drudgery of every day life, are inaccessible to large swathes of people - particularly women and people of colour. Without money, these things are seldom possible. With so much wealth inequality, the pay gap then becomes a problem of wellness.  The pandemic revealed in the most immutable way how poverty affects health outcomes - the first to succumb to coronavirus were mostly racialised people living in disadvantaged areas - but poor people were susceptible to ill health long before.  Consider how those living in areas of high pollution have worse asthma attacks - a young Black girl with asthma even became the first to have pollution listed as a cause of death.  Children's lungs in the most polluted parts of Tower Hamlets, one of the poorest London boroughs, were found to be 10% smaller than expected for their age. And as a double blow, rich people are more likely to drive through and cause pollution in the areas most occupied by poorer groups.  These people can't simply move out and into areas of better air quality. These individuals - while on some of the lowest wages in the country - can't mitigate the circumstances they find themselves in.  So when reports of the pay gap widening between bosses and workers come through (with CEOs and executives pocketing PS2.69m, 86 times more than the average worker), it's difficult not to be infuriated. When you consider the squeeze of the cost of living crisis, it's especially difficult to not be aggravated by these obscene numbers.  For Remi*, 31, who works in admin at a largely successful company, the discrepancy between what she earns and her colleagues feels particularly egregious. She can't relate to their lifestyles. 'I'm a Black woman and I definitely do not earn as much as some of my colleagues,' she tells HuffPost UK. 'I work just as hard and the only difference is that I'm a different gender and race. 'To hear others speak about getting a house or holidays when I'm trying to save as much as possible is very disheartening. I will have to work twice as hard, which is already difficult during this pandemic and mental health being so low.' These disadvantages are causing a mental health crises in those who aren't white or male.  Which is why Mendu, a social enterprise aiming to change mental healthcare and include womxn of colour, was launched.  Creators Regina Zheng and Calah Singleton realised that women of colour like them were being left out of the wellness industry, so they launched Mendu.  'We know that the gender wage gap, coupled with intersecting racial bias in the workplace, means that many womxn of colour are underpaid, and these losses accumulate and grow over time,' Zheng tells HuffPost UK. 'As a result, WoC are less able to accumulate savings, withstand economic downturns, and achieve economic stability.' All this means that women of colour are one of the most at-risk groups when it comes to poor mental health. 'With increasing cost of living, this puts WoC's mental health at risk, after a pandemic that relied on them as essential workers in both the UK and US. For us at Mendu, it's meant that finances has been a topic that is frequently brought up by the audience,' Zheng says.  So, how can people navigate these challenges? After all, they can't will themselves into being healthier individuals.  Zheng says the onus is on powerful systems to dismantle these inequalities, and we need to amp up the pressure on them. 'Going forward, we need governments and companies to find solutions to the gender wage gap and racial bias in the workplace, otherwise, coupled with the cost of living crisis, we worry that there will be a mental health crisis among the population that was an important pillar in keeping the economy moving forward during the pandemic.' So lobby your bosses, set up unions, pressure higher-ups to publish pay figures and push for salary transparency. It's not just your pay packet, but your wellbeing that's currently taking the hit.   Life-Work Balance questions the status quo of work culture, its mental and physical impacts, and radically reimagines how we can change it to work for us.

Here's what the experts think. Why do cases seem to have fallen so much? Reported infections on May 12 were at 7,611 across the UK - the last time we experienced such low rates was on June 8, 2021. Two major infection waves have driven the high numbers we've seen over the past six months, both caused by strains of the Omicron variant. These infections helped increase widespread immunity (working alongside vaccines) which means people are less likely to catch Covid again in the near future.  There's also the reduced amount of testing to consider. Now that people have to pay for Covid tests, fewer infections are being confirmed and logged. Professor of Medicine at the University of East Anglia, Paul Hunter, told the Guardian that now fewer than one in 10 Covid tests are being picked up and reported to the government's Covid dashboard. For comparison, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has reported that 1 in 60 people in England now have Covid, compared to 1 in 55 in Wales, 1 in 80 in Northern Ireland and 1 in 40 in Scotland. So how might Covid cases change over the bank holiday? Usually, the warmer months mean people spend less time inside, in confined spaces where airborne viruses can thrive. This means Covid rates drop. But with a four-day weekend ahead, plenty of parties and an increase in socialising planned, experts have warned that we should expect cases to increase in the coming weeks. Professor Denis Kinane of Cignpost Diagnostics told HuffPost UK that this, alongside waning levels of immunity, could spell a surge in cases. He added: 'We should also expect to see a rise in re-infections and first-time infections. 'What's more, the ending of free tests means people are far less likely to be diagnosed, so they could mix with others while unknowingly carrying the virus.' Similarly, Professor Tim Spector, from King's College London and co-founder of the Zoe Covid app, told the i newspaper: 'We're hearing anecdotes from medical conferences where doctors are meeting up and 10% of them are coming down with Covid when they get home. 'All these big meetings of people, if it's more than just a few minutes, are causing an increase in infections, so I think we will see a spike after this. 'I don't think cases will go up as high as we saw in January, I think it will be a mini blip. But this thing is going to stay in this high endemic state for a while.' This means there could be between 24,000 and 60,000 extra symptomatic Covid cases each day. However, protection against severe illness drops off at a much slower rate than against infection, so this should not trigger high rates of hospitalisations and deaths. What about the new Omicron strains? Kinane predicted that the Omicron subvariants - also known as BA.4 and BA.5 - will probably become the dominant strains in the UK after all the celebratory mixing in the next few days, ousting the current BA.2. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) recently dubbed BA.4 and BA.5 'variants of concern', as they have a growth advantage over their predecessor. He explained: 'Although the overall proportion of these two new forms is currently low, the high transmissibility reported in South Africa indicates that these strains could become dominant in the UK in the coming weeks.' There's also a subvariant called BA.2.12.1 which spreads faster and is currently the dominant strain in the US. However, the immunologist was hopeful that this would not translate into more severe infections even though they are considered to be more infectious. 'So far, there has been no indication that BA.4, BA.5 or BA.2.12.1 are associated with new symptoms or more severe disease,' Kinane explained. The concern with these subvariants, is more about their reach - any increased transmission without a drop in severity, will still have a significant impact. Professor Balloux from UCL also told the i that 'based on current trends, BA.2 may lose its dominance sometimes in early June', meaning the other more transmissible Omicron strains take the lead. Kinane urged people to continue looking out for the typical Omicron symptoms - fever, cough, loss of smell, fatigue and malaise - when trying to detect if they had fallen ill with these new strains. 'This is to be expected, given that the majority of mutations are similar to those found in other Omicron subvariants.' He added: 'Symptoms will however continue to be closely monitored by the WHO and health bodies in countries where these subvariants are being picked up.' How long might this spike last for? Scientists believe this post-Jubilee spike will last only a week or two, but with new variants circulating, levels of infection are unlikely to drop quickly as they normally do during the warmer months when people spend less time indoors. Spector told the i: 'After a number of weeks with cases steadily falling, we are now seeing a real slow down and we predict cases will stall around 100,000 new cases a day for a while... Covid is not going to disappear this summer. 'Hospitalisations and deaths are still right down. It's definitely not killing people off but it's hitting the workforce and leading to some getting long Covid.' Prof Hunter also told The Guardian that we should not expect Covid to ever disappear completely.  'It won't continue falling for ever. Covid is undoubtedly becoming endemic. We are not going to get down to very low numbers again in our lifetimes.' How to protect yourself against Covid during the Jubilee celebrations With large gatherings much more likely, try to test yourself where you can if you are experiencing any Covid symptoms. If the results are positive you should think about isolating to avoid passing the virus on. Immunocompromised people should aim to wear a face mask if attending any large events or travelling on public transport - and others may wish to do the same to protect them.", "54a40a6898bb10fb8f51177a9fbb68fc4532b802e414be03111bbd3e": "They say marriage is hard work. 'They' being every other relative wishing to bestow you with wisdom the moment you get engaged.  The phrase is so regularly repeated that it's sometimes used to bat away more complex friction in a relationship. Arguing with your partner? That's the hard work calling. Intimacy issues? Infidelity? Financial stress? Don't say we didn't warn you...  But a couple of months back, when writer Danielle Weisberg tweeted a jokey take on the oft-repeated idiom, it sparked a debate on whether marriage should feel like hard work, or if this is just something we've been taught to accept. One reply from a woman in Arkansas even went viral in its own right. 'My marriage has never been hard work,' she said. 'My wife literally lowers my blood pressure by walking into the room. (Confirmed and observed by a nurse at the hospital).' So, why do so many cling to this phrase? Should marriage really be hard work? Or does the saying just make us feel better? And if marriage is so easy for some, should everyone else...give up?  Julia Goodall, a psychotherapist and host of the Grounded Families podcast, says therapists sometimes use the phrase 'marriage is hard work' in couples counselling, because they tend to echo the language used by their clients. This is a tactic designed to 'meet people where they are'. However, she works with couples to establish what they mean by 'marriage is hard work'. There can be a difference between marriage feeling like 'work' and 'working on a marriage'.  'I think that idea that marriage is hard is the same if you say gardening is hard,' Goodall tells HuffPost UK. 'It's not hard. It's just that you have to show up every day in tiny ways and keep an eye on it. So it's hard work in terms of the constant commitment of it, but it's not difficult.'  The question of whether marriage should feel like hard work doesn't have a straight yes or no answer, she adds. 'When something like that tweet happens... I looked through some of the responses and it's quite sad, because it polarises people. So either people are like 'marriage is so easy, it's the best thing ever,' or 'marriage is so hard'. And then both parties feel alone. 'The way that we polarise stuff - which is a normal human thing - it doesn't really help conversation. It just says 'I'm in this camp, you're in that camp'. And actually, the conversation that's useful to have, I think, is around 'why does marriage feel hard?' 'Why do we feel on our own a lot of the time?' 'Why do we feel that things are often not how we expected?'' Goodall believes in 2022, we're still sold a 'Disney idea' of what marriage looks like, so it's no wonder it doesn't always live up to everyone's expectations. When people say marriage is hard, what they're often attempting to convey is that they're 'in distress' or 'in chronic disconnection' with their partner. But to prevent marriage feeling like overwhelming 'hard work', you do need to 'work at it' in small ways - again coming back to that gardening metaphor.  'There's a piece around making yourself visible in tiny daily steps,' she explains. 'So saying: 'This is what I need', or 'this is what I feel like', or 'I'm really struggling with all of the things I have to get done in a day. Is there any thing that you can help me with?'' This communication reset should also go the other way. 'Ask: 'How was your day?' 'how are you feeling about this?', 'I feel like this, does that sort of match with you?'' says Goodall. 'It's these tiny little touch points.'  Of course, there are times when marriage does become hard work, to the point where these 'little touch points' can't remedy it. If there's violence, for example, Goodall says that's a red flag that a relationship is toxic and worth leaving. Also, if you're having the same arguments over and over again, or there's been a significant betrayal (such as infidelity), you may need outside help from a therapist to see if it's possible to get you back on the same page. And sometimes, parting ways is the bravest decision - not a failure.  But for the most part, Goodall believes the question 'should marriage be hard work' comes down to people's perceptions about what marriage should entail.  'The people who are in really happy marriages often have very realistic ideas of what marriage looks like,' she says. 'And so sometimes it's just about perception.' Next time you're about to tell a newly engaged couple about the hard work ahead of them, pause to remember this classic When Harry Met Sally scene, which proves that while marriage may require some work, dating isn't exactly a walk in the park, either.  And if you're in a rut of feeling like your own marriage is hard work, pause to question why. As Goodall points out, accepting that marriage isn't perfect can actually be quite liberating.  'We will never fit together like a puzzle piece, there will always be some little kind of jagged edges,' she says. 'There'll be stuff that we're bad at and the other person is not good at. 'And still we choose to love each other. I feel like that feels more meaningful.'

So when England and Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford recently revealed that he and his long-term girlfriend Lucia Loi are now engaged to be married, it was hard not to feel cheered by the announcement. Rashford and Loi, both 24, met at secondary school in Manchester and, bar a brief split in 2021, have been dating ever since. The proposal looked lavish, judging by the footballer's latest Instagram post - but the love seems real. In fact, as Rashford captioned a sweet Instagram slideshow of the pair only a few months ago, the couple have been together 'through thick and thin'. Life - and relationships - aren't always easy. But some pairings do last the course. HuffPost UK has spoken to other long-term couples who met when they were young to hear their love stories, from those in their 20s to those in their 60s. We hear how they got together, when they knew they were in it for the long-haul, and what makes their relationship continue to work. Oh, and we made sure to ask if they had any advice for the rest of us, too. Lauren and Peter: 'We always knew we needed each other' Lauren and Peter Gallagher, both 24, live in Bournemouth with their springer spaniel Maisie.  Lauren: Peter and I were in the same primary school from when we were five, but weren't in any classes together so never really spoke. However, I did have a massive crush on him. We reconnected properly when we were in Year 10 of different secondary schools, and it was like we'd been best friends for years. I developed the hair loss condition alopecia when I was eight. Peter always made me feel comfortable about it and asked very sensible questions. I knew what we had was a forever thing when he asked to see me without my wig on for the first time, about a month into dating, and he cried while saying: 'You're so beautiful.' He recently told me this was when he knew I was the one, too. We were 19 and had been dating for four years when he proposed to me, and we got married aged 20. A lot of people warned us that getting married so young would not end well, however, we always knew we needed each other. When people find out we are childhood sweethearts, we usually get the 'awww that's so beautiful', 'when exactly did you meet?', 'is it weird or nice growing up together?' The answer to that last question is that it's incredible. I feel so privileged to have loved him and been part of his life for so long. And I'm thankful, too, especially because it's meant we have been there to support one another through the personal difficulties we've faced over the years. Obviously there are times where we argue, but coming back to each other, apologising and talking through situations calmly is the best way.  Any advice for others? 'It's true what they say: 'never go to sleep on an argument'. Additionally, hug each other. At random times. Sometimes, especially at the end of a long day, a nice long hug is exactly what we both need and science backs up that it's good for you, too.'  Mandira and Samin: 'We're still best friends'  Mandira and Samin Sarkar, both business owners in their 50s, live in Surrey. Mandira: 'I met my husband in our ancient creaky lift jn Calcutta. My family had moved into our lovely apartment from the tea estates. Samin lived in the other apartment on the same floor, separated by a long corridor. The lift journey took 45 seconds from the ninth to the ground floor and I remember sizing him up. I was 12, Samin was 18 and we became friends. He says he knew it was serious when I was about 16, but didn't want to say anything as he felt I was still too young and needed to go through university and make up my own mind. By the time I was 19, I knew it was serious, too - and we were married when I was 21. We've since moved countries and continents to the UK and are privileged to call two countries home. We live in Surrey where both of us run our own (very different ) businesses. Mine is artisan Indian food while Samin does technology consulting. Our 20-year-old daughter is at university studying law. When I tell friends our lift story and that we are still happily married after 30 years - it was our anniversary this year - they usually find it very uplifting. Our daughter and her friends, typical to their generation, find it 'weird'. I love him to bits although I could murder him some days. I'm impulsive and hot headed but an eternal optimist - he's calm and assumes the worst all the time. However at the end of the day, we are still each other's best friends and able to laugh together and that keeps us going .  Any advice for others? 'The fact that both Samin and I are very different but allow each other the space to be and respect each other's difference makes it work for us. We say that he is the brakes and I am the accelerator in our relationship.'  Andy and Louise: 'There was no aha moment' Louise, 38, who runs a marketing communications agency and husband Andy, 38, a contracts manager, live in Ewell with their three children. Louise: Andy and I were in the same year in primary school and his mum even child-minded us for a while. In the photo below, Andy is in the top row far right, and I'm in the middle row, fifth from left. We weren't particularly close and went to separate secondary schools, but started working in the same local pub, in the kitchen, when we were 15. We became really good friends and got together as a couple when we were 17. After we survived the uni years with me living away in Liverpool and Andy staying at home, we bought our first home together as we turned 22. I don't ever remember having a conversation about it, or there being an 'aha' moment. It's as if we always knew we would be together - so our hopes, dreams and plans were always 'our' hopes, dreams and plans. When I say that we've been together longer than not, we get a resounding 'wow'. People can't imagine how we've made it work, but I don't think we've 'made' anything happen. We've been lucky enough to live and grow together, which is really special because I know it doesn't happen often.  Any advice for others? 'Keep talking. Even when it feels hard and you're frustrated as hell. Making the effort to talk through it means you care to make it right. And... couple time. So much of us is now shared with children, family and work, it's important to have time when we can be fully present.'  Eliot and Helen: 'We are very different' Helen, 58, a medical secretary, and Eliot, 60, a consultant, live in St Albans. Helen: We met at a local youth group disco - I was 15 and it was three weeks before Eliot's 17th birthday. We split up when I was 18 and he was 20 (this was the second year of uni when he met somebody else), but got back together about six months later when I came back from Ibiza and was all tanned. I think he asked me out once and I said no, and then I said yes a couple of weeks later. At the time, my mum told him he mustn't muck me around if we got back together, so I guess we knew it was forever when we did. We just celebrated our 35th anniversary and two lovely children - tragically, our youngest died four years ago and that has made us even stronger as a couple. People can't believe it when they hear we have been together for so long and make jokes about how you get a shorter sentence for murder! I don't really know what makes it work for us. We are very different. Maybe that is the answer.  Any advice for others? 'There must always be give and take, compromise and togetherness, but you have to retain your individuality and independence.'  Louise and Elliott: 'We split everything 50/50' Louise Ali, 39, head of campaigns for an SEO agency, and husband Elliot, 37, a new business development manager, live in Haslemere with their two children. Louise: I saw Elliot on the very first day of Freshers Week - I was chatting with a girl (we are best friends to this day... I like to keep people). I said: 'See that guy in the yellow T-shirt, he is such a hottie!' For the next three months, he was 'yellow T-shirt boy', because I was too nervous to talk to him. Eventually I plucked up the courage, timing my cigarettes at the same time as his. We realised we had loads in common and, along with a couple of other friends, became an inseparable group. After a few months of friendship, we hooked up one night, but both decided we were at uni and didn't want to tie ourselves down, so became friends with benefits (which actually worked out pretty well). When we graduated in 2006, we both assumed that was that but six months later he called me up and asked to go on a date, and the rest is history. We moved in pretty quickly and travelled loads. In 2016, he proposed to me in Paris in front of the Eiffel Tower - just after a bird had pooped on my head. We now have two kids and are absolutely a team. We split everything 50/50 - we alternate cooking every night, who puts the kids to bed, who gets up with them, who goes to the shops, who pays for dinner... everything. That way there's no resentment and everyone's pulling their weight. We also laugh, a lot. The minute I saw him that first day I knew that he was going to be a massive part of my life. Something in my soul just told me that he was for me and we were destined to be together. I thank my lucky stars I found him before dating apps became a thing - I don't know how I would be able to navigate all that. I think people today miss out on the opportunity to just meet a random and get chatting - a friend of mine the other day said they get weirded out if a guy starts chatting to them in a bar, which seems so bizarre and closed off to me.  Any advice for others? 'Communication is key. We don't fight. We might get moody with each other but we always come back when we've cooled down and discuss the issue. We also know each others flaws and don't expect the other to change - although I'm glad he's got better at cleaning up after himself and he's probably glad I've got a bit better at cooking.'  more text", "efd46733acc71813d9828677f607cb9fec38e70a50275e65388adbc8": "The Baggs family have announced they have quit Gogglebox.

There are also a number of new features, including a new wardrobe in the dressing rooms, which is filled with 'pre-loved' outfits as part of the show's new deal with eBay. Producers are ditching their usual fast-fashion tie-ins in favour of a partnership with the second-hand online retailer, with the Islanders sporting recycled items throughout their search for romance. Bosses have also revealed how viewers will be able to buy some of the villa's fixtures and fittings this year.  The show has partnered with Screen With Envy to offer fans the ability to buy a range of interior and garden products showcased on the show.  Love Island called the previous villa in Sant Llorenc des Cardassar in Mallorca home since its third series in 2017.   The first two seasons were hosted at a villa in Santanyi on the Spanish island, while the first (and, so far, only) winter series in 2020 was hosted in Cape Town, South Africa.

The prime minister is under mounting pressure from his own MPs to resign, following the Sue Gray report into partygate. It takes 54 Tory MPs to formally submit a letter for a no confidence vote in Johnson to be triggered. On Tuesday, former cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom signalled her unhappiness with the PM, accusing him of 'unacceptable failings' of leadership. Speaking to Times Radio, former Tory leader and cabinet minister Lord Hague said: 'I said this was a slow fuse. Well such a letter from I guess a senior figure, Andrea Leadsom is the fuse. The fuse is getting closer to the dynamite here and it's speeding up. 'So I think that's just another indication the Conservative Party is moving faster towards a vote of confidence or no confidence. 'So a leadership ballot, which I said earlier could come next week, or at the end of June, a few more letters like that, and it will come next week.'  Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tories, is the only person who knows the number of letters that have been sent in.  It is widely expected in Westminster that Brady would wait until parliament returns from the current recess next Monday, after the Queen's Jubilee celebrations, before revealing whether the threshold had been met.

Depending on your gender, the optimal timing could be different. For women, the best time for exercise may be evenings whereas for men it is mornings, according to a new US study. Previous research into this area of fitness research has predominantly focused on men. But the new study shows that women burn more fat during morning exercise whereas their counterparts do the same in the evenings. The factors that differentiate the sexes are likely to be hormonal differences. biological clocks and sleep-wake cycles, the authors said. The study from Skidmore College, New York State looked at 56 people (30 men and 26 women, all healthy between 25-55) over the course of 12 weeks. They were monitored during fitness programmes which included sprinting, stretching, resistance and endurance training.  One group worked out for an hour, before 8:30 while the other between 6pm and 8pm. Both ate a specially designed meal plan. Researchers looked at everyone's blood pressure and body fat during the 12 weeks, also taking into consider their strength, flexibility, and aerobic power.  The good news is that all who took part in the study saw better overall health, regardless of when they exercised. So whether you're a morning person or an evening person, keeping moving is the way. 'The best time for exercise is the best time you can do it and fit it into your schedule,' said Dr Paul Arcerio, the study's lead author and professor of health and human physiological sciences at Skidmore College. The differences may result from women being more likely to store abdominal fat than men, which coupled with the body's internal rhythm. Researchers want to study the two more to find what exactly causes the optimal times to vary.  But there's a bit more to it, said the authors, who stressed the ideal times can also vary for men and women, depending on the kind of training they do. Based on the study's results, if women want to reduce their blood pressure and lose fat around the middle of their body, they should stick to mornings. But if they are trying to do strength training, particularly targeting their upper body, as well as improving mood and food intake, evening exercise may be best. In comparison, men were found to be less sensitive to timing and were able to improve fitness regardless of timing. But, Dr Arcerio added: 'Evening exercise was found to be ideal for men interested in improving heart and metabolic health, as well as emotional wellbeing.'

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) issued this new advice after 71 new cases of the virus were confirmed in England on Monday. This brings the total to 179 reported cases since May 7, most of which are in England. Four have been in Scotland, two in Northern Ireland and one in Wales. The monkeypox outbreak has taken the public by surprise over the last month because the virus is usually confined to Central and West Africa, but health experts have been clear that this will not develop into a new pandemic. Here's how the authorities believe we can prevent transmission. Is this virus sexually transmitted? No - the virus mainly spreads through any close physical contact but can also live on bedsheets or towels. It also does not spread that easily and there is currently no available evidence that the virus spreads through sexual fluids. So, why is this the new advice? As sex encompasses close physical contact avoiding sex would reduce the risk of passing the virus on, according to the health experts. Anyone who suspects they have the virus should try to cover lesions with clothes, wear a face mask and avoid public transport where possible while they are still potentially infectious. People only stop being infectious once their lesions have healed and their scabs have dried up - usually in one to two weeks - and so should avoid contact with others until this point. But, according to the new guidance, people should still use condoms for at least eight weeks after the infection. The general public have also been advised to keep an eye out for any new rashes or lesions on their bodies. How do you know if you have monkeypox? These are the symptoms:    Fever   Headache   Muscle aches   Backache   Swollen lymph nodes   Chills   Exhaustion   Weakness   Rash   The rash can start on the face before moving to the body. It gradually transforms, and can form sores comparable to chickenpox or syphilis before scabbing. The scab falls off but can leave a scar.  The incubation period (the time before symptoms appear) is usually from six to 13 days but can range from five to 21 days.  Why have gay or bisexual men been particularly warned? The UKHSA report that the majority of cases so far have been among men who have sex with men. However, it's important to note that this is likely due to where the virus allegedly first started to spread - at two European raves - and not because this group are at higher risk of catching it. Anyone is at risk of catching the virus regardless of sexual orientation. What is the risk to the general population? The World Health Organisation's leading monkeypox expert, Dr Rosamund Lewis, said she did not anticipate another pandemic. But, she added: 'We are concerned that individuals may acquire this infection through high-risk exposure if they don't have the information they need to protect themselves.' The UKHSA also said the risk 'remains low', but urges anyone with unusual rashes or lesions to contact NHS 111 or their local sexual health service. Healthcare workers who are pregnant and people with severely weakened immune systems should not care for suspects or confirmed monkeypox cases. Those working with confirmed cases need to wear personal protective equipment, including respirators, aprons, eye protection and gloves.  Those at the highest risk have also been asked to isolate for up to 21 days. Health protection teams are tracing the contacts of positive cases and UK health officials have purchased 20,000 doses of a smallpox vaccine called Imvanex. This vaccine is said to be relatively effective at reducing severe infection and the rate of transmission - it will be offered to those close contacts of the people who are diagnosed with the virus.

The Hollywood star has recalled a time he sat next to the royal - and got to find out first hand what her drink of choice is. The Forrest Gump actor revealed he attended a very plush dinner with Her Majesty and then President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama, during an interview on Monday's The One Show. Tom was referring to a state banquet the Queen hosted at Buckingham Palace in May 2011 to honour the Obamas during their visit to the UK.  'I sat right next to the Queen of England at a dinner with the Obamas,' Tom said during his appearance on the BBC show. 'The chit-chat with the Queen is something you have to get ready for. I knew I was going to be sitting next to her so I wanted to be able to talk about things that were important but not presumptuous. We spoke about how often she gets time off, et cetera.' He then revealed: 'Out of nowhere, I noticed this gloved hand place a tumbler of clear liquid between me and Her Royal Majesty.  'But it wasn't in a water glass, so I dared to ask the Queen, 'what is Her Majesty's cocktail of choice?' and she said 'ooh martini'.' Alas, Tom didn't reveal if HRH prefers it shaken or stirred. Earlier this month, Tom's film character Forrest Gump was in the news after someone lightheartedly suggested they had spotted him in the background of a photo of the Queen. Valentine Low, the royal correspondent for The Times of London, tweeted a picture he took of the British monarch's surprise visit to Paddington Station to officially open the new Elizabeth tube line, named in her honour. There, behind the queen in the background, is a man who at first glance could pass for Gump in scenes from the hit 1994 film in which he finds himself witness to historical events.

Carshalton and Wallington MP Elliot Colburn, who was only elected in 2019, also called today for Johnson to step down and said he had sent in a letter. In a letter to constituents seen by the Daily Telegraph, Nickie Aiken, the MP for Cities of London and Westminster, said Johnson should submit himself to a confidence vote to end 'speculation' over his leadership.  Dan Poulter, the MP for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich, said Johnson's claim that no rules had been broken 'lack credibility'. According to Sky News he said 'to mislead parliament cannot be tolerated' and 'a minister who knowingly misleads parliament should resign'. Andrew Bridgen, the MP for North West Leicestershire, who had previously submitted a letter but withdrew it when the war in Ukraine began, has resubmitted it, according to The Guardian.

This age group, born around the time of the Queen's coronation (making them the platinum jubilee generation) happen to have enjoyed many financial benefits throughout their lives which mean they're better off. Why is this age group wealthier? The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) released new data on Monday explaining: 'This generation benefited from the strong growth in earnings in the 1980s and 1990s in particular, and from the increasing generosity of the state pension in more recent years.' This group also has an average household income of PS26,400 per year now they are not working. This is higher than the population as a whole and even higher than the incomes they received during most of their working lives. IFS explained that, even when this group were around 25 years old, their average incomes were PS12.500 (in modern currency) - while the rest of the UK had PS10,700. Again, during the Golden Jubilee in 2005, they had average incomes of PS26,800 - PS5,700 higher than the UK average at the time.  This group were also able to benefit from the country's property price boom with 85% of them being homeowners and 14% still owning a second home today. Back in 1952, the average property price was the equivalent of PS40,000 in today's money. Now, it has shot up to PS260,000. IFS director Paul Johnson described it as 'extraordinary and unprecedented' data and said: 'I still struggle to get my head round these statistics.' But, that's not the whole picture Despite these findings, UK pensioners have been among the hardest hit by the rising cost of living. In April, the state pension rose by 3.1%. Age UK conducted a survey in January noting that 54% of responding pensioners said the increase in prices means they will have to heat their homes less. Just under a quarter said they will have to choose between heating their homes and the food they buy if their bills went up, while 43% overall said they would have to either cut back, go into debt or just not pay their bill. IFS also noted that before the pandemic, around 18% of the same generation were in relative income poverty. But, for comparison back in the Silver Jubilee year (1977) those over state pension age were more than twice as likely to be poor as those under state pension age, suggesting once again life improved for the Platinum Jubilee generation. What about the government's new cash boost? Last week, chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a heft PS15 billion package to help with skyrocketing energy bills. This was broken down into a PS400 universal payment for all UK households, one-off payments to means-testing benefit recipients worth PS650, and PS150 extra for disabled people. There was also an extra PS300 for pensioner households. Resolution Foundation's chief economist, Mike Brewer, said: 'The biggest winners from yesterday's package are wealthy pensioners, who may not need extra support but still stand to gain PS850, while large families on low incomes may feel rough justice as their higher energy usage isn't reflected in flat-rate lump-sum payments.'", "f7d793d2526a018d04feaea6104a246f53c6ff05557b17bdd2ea6cd9": "A former Conservative attorney general has called for Boris Johnson to resign as prime minister.

The ministry of defence revealed in its daily update on Twitter that Russian forces are likely to be suffering 'devastating losses', especially among mid and junior ranking officers. This comes after Ukraine claimed it had taken out approximately 12 Russian generals in the first three months of the war. The MoD explained: 'Brigade and battalion commanders likely deploy forwards into harm's way because they are held to an uncompromising level of responsibility for their units' performance. 'Similarly, junior officers have had to lead the lowest level tactical actions, as the army lacks the cadre of highly trained and empowered non-commissioned officers (NCOs) who fulfil that role in Western forces.' The west believes that Russia has hidden the true extent of its losses from its public to avoid losing support and even listing its dead as missing. The US's Pentagon estimates Russian president Vladimir Putin's army may have lost up to 25% of its combat power, with Nato estimating it may have lost up to 15,000 troops. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy guessed the real number was much higher, at 23,000 on May 10. As of May 30, Ukraine's Armed Forces estimated that Russia has now lost a total of 30,350 troops. If these estimates are correct, Russia is missing a large portion of its forces meaning it has having to rely on less experienced figures to lead the attack. The MoD tweeted: 'The loss of a large proportion of the younger generation of professional officers will likely exacerbate its ongoing problems in modernising its approach to command and control. 'More immediately, battalion tactical groups (BTGs) which are being reconstituted in Ukraine from survivors of multiple units are likely to be less effective due to a lack of junior leaders.' Putin also dropped the upper age limit on Saturday for troops trying to enlist for the war effort, meaning over-40s can now serve. The UK officials also suggested this lack of leadership was leading to disturbances within the Russian ranks. The MoD tweeted: 'With multiple credible reports of localised mutinies amongst Russia's forces in Ukraine, a lack of experienced and credible platoon and company commanders is likely to result to a further decrease in morale and continued poor discipline.' Away from the Russian system of command, things also aren't going very well. The Ukrainian city of Kherson, where Russia was using as a staging ground for operations, has just become the new focal point for the war after the Ukraine forces launched a surprise counteroffensive.

The 29-year-old presenter said there was 'hostility straightaway' from French police after he arrived at the Stade de France in Paris on Saturday. Speaking on his Capital Breakfast show on Monday, Roman urged authorities to investigate discrimination 'against Liverpool fans'.   He said police funnelled the thousands of Liverpool fans through a narrow alleyway, which was under a metre wide and had a concrete wall on either side, causing one of his friends to have a panic attack. And he accused officers of laughing at fans before tear gassing them. He said: 'No one is kicking off and then all of a sudden, tear gas starts getting thrown at us. All of a sudden, the pepper spray starts coming out from the top, right around the gates, and all those types of things. 'And people are panicking. There were boys there. Young kids were in there. People (were) trying to hold up their kids.' Roman said he saw one fan, who was with his visually impaired father, being pushed by police. He said 'nothing was happening' to provoke officers' response, adding: 'It was the worst experience I've ever had in a football ground.' Roman said he saw upstanding behaviour from fans all weekend, with Liverpool supporters 'respectful of the owners' at every bar he went into ahead of the match, which saw Spanish giants Real Madrid win 1-0.   He added: 'They weren't spilling out on to the street. It was great. Honestly, they were sticking to their areas. There was no trouble. I didn't see one fight or anything that people associate with 'football hooliganism' and things like that. There was nothing. (Everyone was) really, really polite.' The star said he has been 'really annoyed' at tweets suggesting Liverpool fans were to blame. He added: 'I'm not a Liverpool fan but I'll tell you right now, they did absolutely nothing wrong. 'And it was just so, so horrendous. It was discriminatory against Liverpool fans. 'And the reason I say that they should investigate it is because when we got in there, all the Real Madrid fans were in there and the Liverpool fans were not in there at all. It was crazy. It was absolutely crazy. 'And then they have the cheek of it to say, 'Oh, the game's kicked off (late) because of the late arrival of fans'. It wasn't! They wouldn't let you in! It was really, really scary.' France's sports minister Amelie Oudea-Castera blamed fans with fake tickets for causing the chaos. British MPs have called for an investigation amid condemnation of the way the Premier League club's supporters were treated, with Ian Byrne, Labour MP for Liverpool West Derby, who attended the match, saying he has not witnessed such scenes since the 1989 Hillsborough disaster. He has written to Foreign Secretary Liz Truss with a list of seven demands, including a formal probe and apologies, aimed at UEFA and the French authorities.", "18a3b00586d4040918a4eb506ef8ffd3fdd345617d7fa32a16dd52fa": "The UK is not expected to suffer severe power cuts this winter despite reports that the war in Ukraine could lead to further gas shortages across Europe. Ministers have reportedly been warned that up to six million households could face blackouts this winter if Russia decides to cut off more supplies to the EU, thereby increasing global demand. According to the Times, government modelling of a 'reasonable' worst-case scenario predicts major gas shortages in winter if Russia hardens its stance against Europe.  Asked about the reports, the prime minister's official spokesman sought to quell suggestions that millions could be left without power, saying that this was neither what the government nor the National Grid was predicting. However, he did acknowledge that the government had a plan for 'all scenarios'. He told reporters: 'I think you would expect government to look at a range of scenarios to ensure plans are robust, no matter how unlikely they are to pass. Neither the government or National Grid expect power cuts this winter.  'You will know that we are in a fortunate position, we are not dependent on Russian energy imports and have one of the most reliable and diverse energy systems.' Asked about energy rationing, he added: 'We don't expect energy rationing this winter. 'Again, we are in a different position to other countries in that we are not as dependent on Russian energy as some. You will know that we have access to our own North Sea gas reserves, and imports from other reliable partners. 'But again, I think you would expect us to plan for all scenarios.' If the reasonable worst-case scenario comes to pass, it could mean that six million households are forced to ration their energy at peak times in the morning and evening, in curbs that could last for more than a month. Although the UK only receives about 3% of its gas directly from Russia, it is reliant on partners such as Norway, which supply about a third of UK's gas. According to the Times, the worst-case scenario could see Norwegian imports of gas halve as EU demand for it increases. It also envisages Britain receiving no imports of gas from interconnectors in Netherlands and Belgium as both face their own supply crisis. The situation has prompted business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng to ask Britain's coal-fired power stations in Drax, Ratcliffe and West Burton to delay their planned closures.   They were due to close in September under plans to phase them out entirely by 2024 to reduce emissions.

By collecting online grocery prices from seven major supermarket websites and assessing the costs for the 30 items, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has revealed how our grocery bills have changed compared to last year. Just how have prices changed since April 2021? It turns out pasta has increased by 50% in price, while the cost of potatoes has dropped by 14% since April 2021. In terms of the largest price rises in cash terms, beef mince now costs the most as it has risen by 32p to PS2.34 for 500g. Chicken breast has increased by 28p to PS3.50 for 600g, while pasta has increased by 17p and vegetable oil by 14p. However, that's not the case across the board. Potatoes fell by 12p meaning it now costs 75p for a 2.5kg, while cheese dropped by 7p to 88p for 255g, and pizza decreased by 4p to an average of 95p for 300g. These products are the anomalies though - most lowest-cost grocery items have increased at a similar rate to the official measure of inflation for food and drink, by climbing by 6%. Here's a breakdown of the price changes as analysed by the ONS: Shrinkflation ONS noted this had occurred throughout their investigation - it's when pack sizes reduce but the product still costs the same. The organisation is not the first to find this either. The Financial Times noted back in March that Doritos bags allegedly had five fewer chips, while Cottonelle toilet rolls lost 28 sheets while still charging consumers the same amount.  How have prices changed since March? Even in the past four weeks of the ONS survey, it found that the lowest prices increased by 0.9%. Over the past month alone, the items with the largest increase in the lowest price were breakfast cereal, which increased by 6%, mixed vegetables and vegetable oil (5% increase). This is down to the increasing pressures from the Ukraine war (as its exported crops are not able to leave the country) along with the global cost of living crisis. Is everything getting more expensive at the same time? Prices have been fluctuating at different rates to each other. ONS explained the exact timing of these price increases varied according to each product, with pasta surging between November and December while baked beans climbed in price between October and November. Sugar-free or low-salt items of the lowest-cost items often cost the same as the standard version. This interactive graph breaks down how some household items have changed in price over the last year. So, what does this mean? As anti-poverty campaigner Jack Monroe pointed out on Twitter the new data suggests 'the hikes in the value brands and basics have been much higher than average inflation stats' show. The Institute for Financial Studies revealed last week that while most of the UK is dealing with a 9% increase in prices, British households with the lowest income are struggling with 10.9% inflation instead. Monroe also pointed to their own research from January. They monitored the way prices in basic groceries had fluctuated recently and went viral for analysing how those everyday basics compared to the change in prices for more luxury items. Monroe tweeted that this latest study was conducted following their campaign earlier this year. They added: 'As I have said for 10 years now, and as many others have pointed out before + alongside me, it's FAR more expensive to be poor. And now the literal experts in data gathering and statistics are helpfully, methodically, forensically backing that up. This feels like huge progress.'", "ee2aa7c9a3337f55508b620e1bca0c961a0b65d3088c6fd7db0c702a": "No.10 has not denied a party took place in Boris Johnson's flat on the evening of his 56th birthday during lockdown. According to The Sunday Times, Carrie Johnson, the prime minister's wife, organised a gathering with 'several friends' in their Downing Street home on 19 June 2020. At the time indoor mixing between households was forbidden by Covid laws. Johnson was issued a fine by the Metropolitan Police for attending a surprise birthday bash in the Cabinet Room during the day. But the potential second gathering was not included in Sue Gray's partygate report published last week. The Sunday Times said an aide possesses messages sent by Carrie Johnson at around 6.15pm appearing to notify her husband that she was in the flat 'with an unspecified number of male friends'. The messages are said to have been sent after she was told the prime minister was coming up to the residence. Asked about the event on Monday, the prime minister's spokesperson did not deny it took place. Angela Rayner, Labour's deputy leader, has said the prime minister must 'come clean' about his 'involvement in this apparently rule-breaking gathering'. The Cabinet Office said it seriously disputed the account of events as detailed in the press.", "526a454f9ca43cad10bb49c6bea2bf767699e9391ce24d7e247059db": "Fresh partygate allegations surrounding Boris Johnson's wife are threatening to derail his premiership just as he desperately tries to get back on track. Leaked text messages suggest there was a second gathering in the prime minister's Downing Street flat during lockdown held by his wife on his birthday. Carrie Johnson is accused of holding the event on June 19, 2020, which was not mentioned in the Sue Gray Partygate report - sparking accusations of a cover-up. Carrie's spokesperson insists that Gray had been made aware of the texts, but the Labour Party is calling for an investigation. Here HuffPost UK takes you through the new allegations and what might happen next. What Allegedly Happened? The claims centre on the prime minister's birthday, on June 19, 2020, in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic when indoor mixing was banned.  Earlier that day Boris Johnson attended his own surprise birthday bash in the cabinet room, complete with sandwiches, cake and booze.  Attendees including Carrie, chancellor Rishi Sunak and the PM were all handed PS50 fixed-penalty notices for the breach. Details of the PM's 56th birthday bash were also described in the report by senior civil servant Sue Gray. However, allegations have since emerged that the festivities did not end there. According to The Sunday Times, there is possible evidence of a second gathering taking place a few hours later involving Carrie in the Downing Street flat and 'several friends'. The event was not investigated by Gray, the newspaper said, despite her team being informed of it in January. The paper claims an aide has messages sent by Carrie at around 6.15pm appearing to notify her husband, after his aide informed her the PM was coming up to the residence, that she was in the No.11 flat 'with an unspecified number of male friends'. The Telegraph claims the event was attended by at least two male friends, both of them special advisers. The paper claims that her text message read: 'Great. I am already here with the gays,' - an affectionate reference to her gay male friends. However, Carrie had no formal position in government so it is uncertain what the work purpose could be. The anonymous aide has reportedly since written to cabinet secretary Simon Case to inform him of the alleged gathering. Why Didn't Sue Gray Investigate?  The existence of the texts was made known to the Gray inquiry in January, according to reports. The aide declined to forward the messages on, but said they were prepared to go to the Cabinet Office and show them to inquiry officials in person.  The aide also said they agreed to supply them to the Met Police, which was conducting an investigation. However, the Cabinet Office has seriously disputed this version of events and sources suggested the individual did not offer to bring the messages in. Instead, their email exchange was forwarded to the police once the Operation Hillman inquiry started. A Cabinet Office source told The Telegraph: 'The individual did not offer to bring the messages into the Cabinet Office, so there was no chance for the investigation team to read them.' The aide later came back to Gray's team but the Cabinet Office said the probe had concluded by the time she approached them a second time. What Does Carrie Johnson Say? A spokesman for Carrie said Gray was aware of the exchanges as part of her exhaustive inquiry into alleged breaches. 'Staff were given ample opportunity to present evidence including these messages and all relevant information was passed to the Metropolitan Police for investigation,' they added. 'The lunchtime gathering in the cabinet room on June 19, 2020, was subsequently found to be in breach and a fixed penalty notice was issued to Mrs Johnson among others, for which she apologised unreservedly and promptly paid the fine.' What Is Labour Saying? Labour is demanding that the prime minister account for his 'whereabouts' on his 56th birthday amid claims he might have attended a second 'potentially illegal' gathering that day. Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, has written to Case calling on him to release correspondence that relates to an alleged evening meet-up. She told the head of the civil service: 'It is crucial that you now advise the prime minister to come clean about his involvement in this apparently rule-breaking gathering. 'Given the public interest at stake, I request that you make public his correspondence pertaining to this event and his whereabouts on the date of Friday June 19 2020 and publish the relevant messages you have received, as well as handing them over to the Privileges Committee to consider as part of their investigation.' Rayner also asked whether Johnson had 'notified' Scotland Yard 'of his presence' at a gathering on the evening in question. She told Case that Downing Street had previously been asked about the evening birthday claims and had branded them 'totally untrue'. The senior opposition figure questioned who authorised that response and whether it would be 'retracted on the basis that it was itself either misleading or false'. Labour's Lisa Nandy also criticised the drinking culture in No.10 following the revelations.  What Will Happen Next? The Commons privileges committee, investigating the PM for misleading the House of Commons, may decide to investigate. It might mean Carrie could be summoned to give evidence to MPs over this new gathering. The committee may also decide to look into a so-called 'Abba party' on November 13, 2020, when officials claimed to hear songs blaring out from the PM's flat the evening aides Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain quit. Labour MP Chris Bryant, who is standing aside as chair of the committee, told Sky News: 'I'm sure the committee will want to follow the evidence wherever it may lead.'  According to the BBC's Chris Mason the committee will be able to demand documents and witnesses as part of their work that could take until October.    What Is The Government Saying? Technology minister Chris Philp has said it is not 'immediately obvious' that there should be an investigation into an alleged second event hosted by Carrie. Asked on Sky News if the alleged gatherings should be investigated, he replied: 'I think we have had an unbelievably comprehensive set of investigations going on now for a period of nearly six months. 'We have had obviously the Sue Gray investigation published last week. And she interviewed, goodness knows, dozens or possibly even hundreds of people in the course of her investigation, looked at emails, messages, and everything else. 'And we have had the Metropolitan Police investigation, which again, has gone over and gone on over a number of months. 'And they conducted that with full police powers. 'So, having had two separate investigations, including by the police over many months, it is not immediately obvious to me that we need any more investigations when this has probably been the most... rightly been, the most thoroughly investigated set of incidents in recent times.'

And details of the contestants are dropping in. But one Islander has already got everyone's attention - Natasha Ghouri, the villa's first ever deaf contestant. Series 8 will see Ghouri head to the Majorcan villa in a bid to find love and, in her words, 'someone to go on holidays with'. The 23-year-old dancer from Thirsk, Yorskhire, said in her Love Island bio: 'My dating life has been a shambles. This is an opportunity for me to find 'the one' and have a great summer at the same time. I'm definitely ready for a relationship.' Ghouri also said she is 'very open' about wearing a cochlear implant, a surgically implanted neuroprosthesis that is designed to give someone with moderate to profound hearing loss extra sound perception. She recently shared an image to her Instagram account, showing her wearing the implant during a dance performance. She also said her friends and family would call her 'inspirational' for her approach to her own deafness. 'I'm very loyal to my friends and family, I'll always have their backs. They would definitely say I'm a nap queen - I love napping! I think they'd also say I'm inspirational because of my hearing and my cochlear implant. I inspire quite a lot of people because I'm really open about it,' she wrote in her Love Island bio. Social media users have already been celebrating Ghouri and the deaf representation she will bring to the show.    Award-winning deaf and disabled journalist Liam O'Dell led the cheerleading, tweeting: 'Huge congratulations to Natasha for being the show's first deaf contestant! Another win for #DeafRepresentation.' And he wasn't the only one.   Others used the announcement as an opportunity to call for better access and subtitling for the show. Recent deaf representation on TV has gone down well, with calls for more of it.  In 2021, Strictly Come Dancing champion Rose Ayling-Ellis was hailed as 'a shining example to deaf and hearing people alike' by charities, while her win was celebrated as 'a victory for the deaf community'.   The EastEnders star, who is deaf, used an interpreter during the series and her Bafta-winning Couple's Choice dance, which she repeated during the final, later calling for BSL to become a legally recognised language. With Ghouri now set to enter the Love Island villa, deaf charities are applauding the casting. Annie Harris, Advocacy Officer at the national deaf charity RNID, tells HuffPost UK: 'Our charity and supporters are really pleased that another major TV show is featuring a deaf contestant. 'Representation matters and, as Rose proved on Strictly, this can make a massive difference to the public's understanding. And let's hope the new season of Love Island is always shown with subtitles so that people who are deaf or have hearing loss get to enjoy the show like everyone else.'

'I thought he was in court but turns out he's in Sheffield with Jeff Beck.' Depp's surprise visit to the UK comes amid his multimillion-dollar defamation lawsuit with his ex-wife Amber Heard.

That has to change.' The article does not mention her ex by name, yet his lawyers say it falsely implies he physically and sexually abused the Aquaman actress while they were together. On Friday both sides gave their closing statements, urging jurors to consider other victims of domestic abuse. The jury is now deliberating the outcome for the case which began on 11 April and involved six weeks of evidence.   Depp is claiming $50million (PS39.5 million) in damages in the lawsuit and says that the allegations caused him to lose several high-profile film roles, including parts in the Fantastic Beasts and Pirates Of The Caribbean franchises.

But it happens in the UK, too. Anti-abortion activists have protested outside healthcare facilities in the UK, with placards displaying graphic images, likening abortions to murder, and questioning the moral character of women seeking treatment. Now, medical leaders in the UK are calling on the expansion of buffer zones - a perimeter around an abortion facility intended to limit how close anti-abortion demonstrators can approach. The Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH) which represents 14,000 UK doctors, is calling for a network of legally-protected spaces that will protect people accessing reproductive healthcare to be implemented across the country.  This comes after the British Pregnancy Advisory Service revealed that 50 new clinics have been targeted by protesters in England and Wales since 2018. Dr Edward Morris, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, told the BBC: 'Abortion care is an essential sexual and reproductive health service and buffer zones must be introduced to ensure that the privacy and rights of those who access these services are respected. 'The harassment and ongoing intimidation of women and staff outside of abortion clinics is unacceptable and would not be tolerated for any other healthcare service.' Global abortion rights have been firmly in the spotlight again this month after leaked documents suggested the US Supreme Court plans to remove the national law protecting the right to have an abortion in America. The landmark ruling, known as the Roe vs Wade case, was first established in 1973 and legalised abortion for the whole country.  Although abortion is legal across the UK, under a law passed in 1861 any woman who ends a pregnancy without legal authorisation from two doctors can still face up to life imprisonment - which is why campaigners continue to call for abortion to be decriminalised.   And although abortion was legalised in Northern Ireland in October 2019, access to appointments remains limited.  Parts of the UK have already experienced a rise in anti-abortion activists outside clinics in recent years, which some claim have been directly 'recruited' by American religious groups.   In response, the first abortion buffer zone was successfully set up in Ealing, London, in 2018, but since then any other protected spaces have failed to materialise.  Now the government is facing fresh calls to introduce the measure more widely in England and Wales.  Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's First Minister has already said she is looking to see how Holyrood can legislate on this issue. She is set to chair an emergency summit on buffer zones in June.   FSRH president Dr Asha Kasliwal said harassment and intimidation outside these facilities caused great distress to both patients and staff.    'The only way to ensure patients are able to access healthcare free of harassment and intimidation is the legal implementation of buffer zones,' she said. However, anti-abortion campaigners are claiming these buffer zones impinge on their right to protest and would 'criminalise their prayers'.    While the controversial Public Order Bill would curb protesting powers, the government is considering an amendment to the bill to protect areas outside clinics. A debate on this topic by a cross-party group of MPs is tabled for June.

It comes after 19 children and two adults were killed after a teenage gunman opened fire at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas.

The Queen is set to become the first UK monarch to celebrate 70 years on the throne on Thursday, June 2, and the country is ramping up in preparation for the big event. However, choosing to cover Stonehenge - one of the UK's most famous landmarks - in projected images of the Queen from different decades in her life has been seen as a step too far for some. The Salisbury monument first became an important structure around 5,000 years ago, but the exact reasons behind its assembly are a mystery. The stones themselves align towards the sunrise for the summer solstice (making it appear a supernatural place) although it is widely believed to have been a burial ground initially. Nowadays, the monument is very well protected and members of the general public are not allowed to touch the rocks so that the site does not become damaged - making the decision to project images of the Queen onto the stones even more peculiar. The site has become associated with folklore over the centuries due to its puzzling origins, a detail which did not escape Twitter users when they commented on the new decorations covering the world heritage site.

Chris Philp said they were taking precautions amid reports that millions may face blackouts this winter because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Ministers have reportedly been warned of potential power cuts to as many as six million households this winter and the government is drawing up plans for rationed electricity if supply issues deteriorate. Government modelling of a 'reasonable' worst-case scenario predicts major gas shortages in winter if Russia cuts off more supplies to the EU, The Times reported. The paper reports that limits could be imposed on industrial use of gas, including on gas-fired power stations, causing electricity shortages. As a result, six million homes could see their electricity rationed, primarily during morning and evening peaks, in curbs that may last more than a month. Worse modelling is reported for a scenario in which Russia cuts off all supplies to the EU. Technology minister Philp told Times Radio: 'I think what the business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng did last week was take some sensible precautionary measures to guard against a potential worst case scenario, he asked the three remaining coal fired power station operators to just keep their power stations available beyond the point of which they were due to be switched off. 'And I think he's considering whether Hinkley B, the large nuclear power station might continue beyond its planned end of life as well. 'That's a sensible precautionary measure, given that gas supply coming out of Russia, and Ukraine is for obvious reasons, so heavily disrupted and we do, of course, use quite a lot of gas to generate electricity. 'Only a very small proportion of that, of course, comes from Russia, a lot of ours comes from Norway and in the form of liquefied natural gas. 'But of course, disruption to the global gas market will have a knock-on effect that may affect the gas that we consume domestically in the United Kingdom. 'So I think these are just sensible precautionary measures, just to guard against a potential worst case scenario.' A spokesperson for the Department of Business said the UK had 'no issues' with either gas or electricity supply and they were 'fully prepared' for any scenario even those that are 'extreme and very unlikely to pass'. 'Thanks to a massive PS90 billion investment in renewable energy in the last decade, we have one of the most reliable and diverse energy systems in the world,' the spokesperson added, 'and unlike Europe, we are not dependent on Russian energy imports.' Threats to the security of supply have prompted Kwarteng to ask Britain's coal-fired power stations to delay their planned closures. The request for power stations in Drax, Ratcliffe and West Burton to stay open was made following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. They were due to close in September under plans to phase them out entirely by 2024 to reduce emissions.", "fc5d7f0411d1255f79d2e44e548cc7baca952cd3c9e167ecc4cfad6e": "Lisa Nandy criticised the drinking culture in No.10 again on Monday as new partygate claims emerged over the weekend. The Sunday Times has reported that the prime minister's wife, Carrie Johnson, may now have had two supposed parties in Downing Street but neither of the alleged gatherings are going to be investigated by Sue Gray. As Labour's shadow levelling up secretary, Nandy told Sky News: 'What this shows to me is not that there's been another party or that there should be another investigation. ''Much more that there is clearly a culture which the prime minister has presided over, where people made the rules, they broke the rules, they lied about it and they laughed about it. And they're still trying to get away with it. 'For a lot of families in this country that is incredibly offensive for the whole country, that's a very serious thing.' Her strong remarks came after digital minister Chris Philp told Sky's Kay Burley that he did not see any reason for there to be further investigations into partygate. 'I think we've had an unbelievably comprehensive set of investigations, now going on for a period of nearly six months,' Philp said, later adding: 'It's not immediately obvious to me that this has - rightly - been the most thoroughly investigated set of incidents in recent times.' In response, Nandy claimed: 'It's difficult for him to argue that and probably privately he would accept that, when the revelations keep coming on about more.' Taking aim at Johnson again, the shadow cabinet minister added: 'In the end if you can't trust the prime minister to make sure the rules he made were followed, what can you trust him to do?' These latest partygate have come after the Met Police's probe concluded and the Sue Gray report was published last week. However, there is still an investigation by MPs ahead, to see if Johnson knowingly misled the Commons when he - repeatedly - said no rules had been broken in Downing Street. If Johnson were found to have done so, it would be a breach of the ministerial code. Last week, No.10 announced it was changing the wording of the ministerial code, removing early references to honesty and making it so minor breaches did not mean people had to resign. Such a move prompted outrage from the general public. Labour have since called for there to be an impartial approach to the ministerial code, so those in power 'can't bend the rules to suit them'.", "81ad966d1d54ccb8119c35aa8cccfa6abc06b1023e152a2ccf83f082": "The Ukrainian winners of this year's Eurovision Song Contest have sold their trophy to raise money to buy drones for their country's military. Kalush Orchestra auctioned off the crystal microphone trophy they were presented with after winning this year's competition for $900,000 (PS712,000). The band raised a further $370,000 (PS293,000) by raffling off the pink bucket hat frontman Oleh Psiuk wore during the performance. Sunday's auction was hosted by Ukrainian TV presenter Serhiy Prytula and the money is going to his charitable fund, which raises funds for the Ukrainian army in their battle against invading Russian forces. The presenter announced that the money raised from the sale of the trophy would be used to purchase three Ukrainian-made PD-2 drones. Drones are used heavily by Ukrainian and Russian forces, both as weapons and reconnaissance aircraft. The auction coincided with the band's appearance at a charity concert at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate. Speaking at the gig, band member Oleh Psiuk appealed for people not to get used to the war, which has left at least 4,031 civilians dead and 4,735 injured, according to the UN, along with an unknown number of military personnel. It has also forced more than 14 million people to flee their homes since Russia invaded on 24 February, with towns and cities reduced to rubble. 'I think it should be on the front pages always, until peace comes,' said Psiuk. Kalush Orchestra, who were fighting as part of the Ukrainian resistance only weeks before Eurovision, received support from across Europe for their performance. They beat Britain's Sam Ryder into second place, with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky going on to claim the country would host the contest in Mariupol next year.", "bc2429fd1930e56e93b14880b96231435841ce68ba5a8ed02432dcd8": "If you saw Nadine Dorries' 'rap' on TikTok last week and thought we'd reached peak cringe, we're afraid to say that Andrew Neil has gone one better/worse (delete as applicable). The culture secretary raised eyebrows when she shared a clip of herself rapping about the Online Safety Bill, spitting bars like: 'If companies fail to comply with the law, and fail to protect the users that they're responsible for, the regulator Ofcom will have the power to fine, so platforms must keep people safe online.' During Sunday night's instalment of The Andrew Neil Show, the host played a clip of Dorries' rap, before launching into a verse of his own. Bopping from side to side, the 73-year-old was heard rapping:  I'm here to present The Andrew Neil Show I'm on the mic, so get with the flow. Top politicians here on C4, it's just half an hour but they all want more I ask all the questions like I just don't care So come on Boris, get in the chair!   And then, of course, he dropped the mic. The clip then made its way online, with Twitter users not quite able to comprehend what they were watching: Even Dorries herself ended up poking fun at the clip, commenting: 'Nicki Minaj won't be losing any sleep tonight.' The Andrew Neil Show debuted on Channel 4 earlier this month, less than a year after the launch of GB News, which Neil was previously the chairman of. Two weeks after the ill-fated broadcaster began in June 2021, Neil announced he was taking an extended break from his nightly topical show, only to wind up never returning. He has since spoken out several times about behind-the-scenes difficulties at GB News, which was also blighted by on-air technical issues and pranks from viewers within its first few weeks of broadcasting.", "5f3d7b558837af356259c341ec08f375794c38bb18ee089cfaa3ca83": "Digital minister Chris Philp was quick to show his support for the Liverpool fans who clashed with the French police during the controversial Champions League final in Paris. Ahead of the match between Real Madrid and Liverpool on Saturday, the French police fired tear gas and pepper spray at some UK fans while they were waiting to get into the stadium. Paris police report that they made 105 arrests at the game in a bid to control the crowd. However, Philp told Sky News on Monday: 'I was horrified to see those pictures of fans, including some children, disabled fans, being pepper-sprayed by police. 'From the pictures I saw, there was no obvious justification for that kind of behaviour.' Over the weekend, the culture secretary Nadine Dorries described it as 'deeply concerning'. She added: 'I urge UEFA to launch a formal investigation into what went wrong and why.' Philp made it clear he sided with Dorries, telling Sky's Kay Burley: 'Nadine, I think, is quite right to call for UEFA to investigate what happened here, because we don't want to see UEFA fans, least of all children and disabled fans, being pepper-sprayed by police.' European football's governing body UEFA has said it planned to 'review these matters urgently'. The French sports ministry has also called for a meeting with UEFA, the French Football Association, police and stadium officials today. It comes after the French interior minister Gerald Darmanin's tweet to blame British fans for the chaos. He tweeted on Saturday: 'Thousands of British 'supporters' without tickers or with counterfeit tickets, forced entry and sometimes assaulted the stewards. 'Thank you to the very many police forces mobilised this evening in this difficult context.' Philp completely dismissed this angle on Monday, claiming the pictures he saw 'did not depict Liverpool fans doing anything of the sort'. The kick-off for the highly-anticipated match was delayed by 36 minutes, as UEFA initially blamed the 'late arrival' of fans. The governing body later changed their explanation to 'security reasons'. Still, UEFA claimed the entry into the stadium at the Liverpool end was 'blocked by thousands of fans who had purchased fake tickets which did not work', although British supporters have repeatedly denied this. Fans have told the BBC they were afraid and felt unsafe ahead of the match. Others left early, keen to make it home after the conflict. Merseyside Police had officers in the French capital who attended the match and reported 'the vast majority of fans behaved in an exemplary manner, arriving at turnstiles early and queueing as directed'. Labour MP Ian Byrne has also written to foreign secretary Liz Truss, and called for an apology from UEFA and the French police for the treatment of the Liverpool fans. Liverpool lost to Real Madrid by 1-0.", "55812cfc5cb5f525b8596651f4782be846b2b741bfbb7370ccad2684": "Euphoria star Dominic Fike is being slammed after making controversial comments about Aquaman actor Amber Heard.  Fike was performing at a concert at Northwestern University last week when he shocked fans by randomly pausing the show to express his thoughts on Heard. In a video that's gone viral, the actor can be seen and heard saying, 'Yo, so I'm just gonna come straight out and say it. I'ma come out and say it. I'ma be real with y'all. I think Amber Heard is hot, dude.' During his brief rant, the crowd at the show in Evanston, Illinois, appeared to be confused, but Fike didn't ease up.  The actor went on to confess he had envisioned the Aquaman star abusing him.  'I know it's not a popular opinion and it's not the focus at the moment, dude, but I've been having these visions of her just beating me up. I think it's hot,' he continued.  Fike never clarified why he voiced his thoughts on Heard seemingly totally out of the blue, but fans quickly shut him down with a crescendo of boos.  The star's comments come amid public scrutiny toward Heard over a defamation lawsuit with her ex-husband Johnny Depp that kicked off last month.  Depp filed the lawsuit in March 2019 after she wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post, in which she alleged that she was a victim of domestic abuse while married to Depp. Depp is currently battling Heard in the $50 million case.  Fike, who appeared unperturbed by the crowd's negative reaction, continued the concert.  Fans quickly took to Twitter to bash Fike for appearing to condone domestic violence.", "add9ec272c49ed73d81c0361d4d002a3c928e68ea25f465b066971b8": " We hope you love the products we recommend!

The latest school shooting took the lives of 21 people, including 19 children at an Uvalde, Texas, elementary school that was just days away from breaking for summer vacation.  The students who survived had their childhoods stolen that day, too. The lives of those children, who were already as familiar with active shooter drills as they were with math homework, were irrevocably changed.  They're also now part of another sobering, distinctly American stat. Since Columbine in 1999, more than 311,000 students have experienced some form of gun violence at school. In the wake of the Uvalde shooting, HuffPost spoke to 11 survivors of such school shootings - students and a few teaching staff, too - about how the news of yet another campus shooting has affected them, and how the shootings at their schools affect them to this day. Here's what they had to say. Jaimee Roeschke || Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, California, on November 14, 2019  Jaimee Roeschke, now a senior in high school, was 15 when a 16-year-old classmate at Saugus High School shot five schoolmates, killing two and wounding three, before killing himself. 'I was in a classroom nearby with my sister. When we were finally escorted out, we could see the quad where it happened. I saw what I thought was blood as well as yellow tape. Later on the news, I saw them giving chest compressions to one of the victims. I knew one of the victims who was killed, Gracie Muehlberger. The other victim who was killed is Dominic Blackwell. Gracie and I weren't close but when we did talk, she was such a sweetheart, just a genuine ray of sunshine. Although I didn't know Dominic, I heard that he was a fun-loving goofball and amazing friend.  'Experiencing gun violence has greatly removed the sense of normalcy from my life. I cannot go out to breakfast with my parents without hypervigilance setting in. My heart races, I hyperventilate, I get chest pains, cry and constantly replay triggering memories in my head. I cannot walk to class without being completely overwhelmed by the anxiety the rush of a crowd brings. Hearing people scream or run in the halls makes my blood run cold. I have PTSD, trouble sleeping. It's incredibly isolating and it's taken a huge toll on my mental health. Every time I hear about a new school shooting, I feel as though I'm grieving for those victims and that school but also my own trauma and school. Every time it happens, I relive my own trauma and feel more and more horrified by this country and its lack of humanity. Every time it happens I get more and more scared to set foot outside or pursue an education.' -- Jaimee Roeschke Julie Schardt || Cleveland Elementary School shooting in Stockton, California, on January 17, 1989 Julie Schardt was a second grade teacher at Cleveland Elementary School in 1989, when five kids, age 6 to 9, were shot and killed. More than 30 others were wounded by the gunman, who shot them with a semi-automatic rifle. Today, the retired school teacher is a founding member of Cleveland School Remembers, an advocacy group which pushes for stricter gun laws across the country. 'Even though our incident was over 33 years ago, when something like this happens, the images from that day always revisit me. As a teacher, my job was first to make sure my students were safe. The shooting on that day changed the trajectory of our experience at school. Nobody would ever have imagined the horror that invaded our peace. Five of our children were murdered that day, and more than 30 others were wounded. My student, Oeun Lim, a delightful book-loving, imaginative eight-year-old, was killed that day. Two more of my students were wounded by bullets and shrapnel, and all of them were seared by what they witnessed. 'Uvalde took me back to our cafeteria, where parents came to pick up their children. They didn't know if they'd be able to hug their children and take them home or have to face the worst day of their lives. It sickens and chills me to think about it. And I think about Uvalde's teachers. They might be survivors, but their hearts and souls will be tattooed by the pain of that day. 'It will be a long while before the families feel safe anywhere. Fireworks on the Fourth of July will be unbearable, their explosive cracks bringing back the sound of AR bullets leaving a gun and shattering little bodies. 'I remain hopeful through all this that at some point we will 'do something,' but it has to be soon and it will take everyone who cares about children, about the common good, about the possibility of a better day to make it happen.' -- Julie Schardt Crystal Woodman Miller || Columbine High School in Columbine, Colorado, on April 20, 1999 Crystal Woodman Miller was a 16-year-old junior at Columbine High School when two classmates killed 12 students and one teacher, also wounding around 23 others, before killing themselves. Today, Woodman Miller, 39, is a speaker and author of Marked for Life: Choosing Hope and Discovering Purpose After Earth-Shattering Tragedy. 'I was in the library, where much of the violence took place. For 7.5 minutes, as I took cover under a table, I listened to the killers gun down friends and classmates, and waited to die. I was wrapped up in my friend's arms and chest who told me that he'd take a bullet for me, so I didn't see much, only heard what they were saying. They laughed and joked as they gunned down their victims, making fun of them and mocking them for the colour of their skin, if they were overweight or wore glasses. They targeted those who believed in God and told us all we were going to die. Later I learned that I knew five of the victims, including my coach for softball and basketball, Dave Sanders. 'I didn't feel safe for a long time anywhere. I was sceptical of everyone I saw, thinking they wanted to kill me. I had endless nightmares, where I would not only relieve my experience at Columbine, but dream up new tragedies that I was trying to escape. I was a walking, talking paradox: I wanted to be around people, but also wanted to be alone. I wanted to see what they were saying on the news, but was also repulsed by watching the news. I needed noise and wanted it quiet. I wanted a manual to walk through suffering, but also didn't want anyone telling me what to do or how to feel or heal. I wanted to cry, but I was tired of crying. I wanted to smile and laugh again, but I felt guilty to do so. I was thankful I lived, but also wished I had died because the pain was overwhelming and the grief was suffocating. It was nearly impossible to find footing in those days. It's normal: That's grief and trauma. 'Being a survivor of a mass shooting means dealing with its effects for the rest of your life. It will forever be a part of your story - but the degree to which it will affect you depends on choice and some intentionality. Because we are unable to change what has happened to us, we must instead choose our response and it takes intentionality. Setting goals, working with others like a trauma-trained therapist to put one foot in front of the other toward healing. It's easy and natural to want to give up, hide, self-medicate, choose anger, hatred, bitterness and even un-forgiveness. It is easy and natural to stop trusting people and push them away, and isolate yourself. It's incredibly easy to give into despair, and hopelessness. Believe me, I get it. But when we choose daily, that our story doesn't end at tragedy, but can be a new point of beginning, we have the perspective we need to live again, and even thrive.' -- Crystal Woodman Miller Gabrielle Ben-Zaken || Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on February 14, 2018 Gabrielle Ben-Zaken, now 19, was 15 when a classmate opened fire on students and staff at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killing 17 people and injuring 17 others. 'At 15 years old, I had to say goodbye to my two friends, Alyssa Alhadeff and Martin Duque, as well as my geography teacher, Scott Beigel. I also had to say goodbye to everything I perceived as normalcy. 'At first, I was incapable of being in public, especially in large crowds. I spent years of my life fearful of leaving my house. Going to school became an everyday struggle. There was never a day at school where I felt safe, I was constantly on edge. My eyes would always scan a classroom searching for the safest hiding spot in the scenario a shooting would happen again. Every time I hear about another mass shooting, these thoughts tend to come back. 'I definitely still have my days where I'm reminded by everything. Overall, though, I believe I am almost there with closure. Within the past year, I have seen life from a new perspective. I am finally capable of enjoying experiences that life has to offer. I was so sick of living my life in fear, constantly waking up discouraged and feeling like I was living for nothing. I'm capable of being in public spaces, whether it's everyday activities such as grocery shopping or going to concerts like I once did. It's crazy to think that I was incapable of dining in at a restaurant a few years ago given that I now work as a hostess in one. Acknowledging my progress encourages me everyday. I never want anyone to feel as if their trauma will forever define them.' - Gabrielle Ben-Zaken Alexandra Rozenblat || Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on February 14, 2018 Alexandra Rozenblat, now 19, was 15 and in 10th grade when the Parkland shooting occurred. 'I remember being 10 years old when Sandy Hook happened and being terrified then to go to school. I wouldn't go to the bathrooms or walk the halls alone in fears of what would happen. When it did happen for me, I was in 10th grade. The shooter was roaming the halls while I was hiding in my classroom. I heard what felt like endless rounds of gunshots going off and screams and cries for help. I had a few classmates lose their lives and others get injured. 'Now, my sense of security and safety is completely gone. Every time I walk into a room I look for the nearest exit or for a good hiding spot. I analyse every person that walks into a room, specifically if they're carrying a large bag. I am a big concertgoer and it took me a while to feel comfortable at my safe place after the shooting. But on the other hand, I take every opportunity I can to travel or do something I love. I am aware of how short and precious life is and I don't want to waste a single second of it.  'I think it is hard to get closure especially with something like this that was so tragic and so easily preventable. I will get closure once I know that it is safe to go into a classroom, or a grocery store, or place of worship. We shouldn't have to live like this. ' -- Alexandra Rozenblat William 'Tipper' Thomas || Randallstown High School in Baltimore, Maryland, on May 7, 2004 High school football player William 'Tipper' Thomas was 17 when a fellow student got into a fight with some of his teammates in the parking lot and outside the steps of the school. The student pulled out a gun and fired into a crowd, leaving Thomas partially paralyzed and three others wounded. Thomas, now 35, is senior principal systems engineer for the aerospace and defence industry.  'In 2004, I was a graduating senior with collegiate athlete aspirations. I was shot at close range while protecting a fellow student. I was left paralysed. The other three had non-life-threatening injuries including my quarterback, Marcus. 'People don't talk enough about the rush to return to 'normalcy' after a mass shooting. The shooting incident I experienced was on May 7, 2004, which was a Friday. May 10, school was back in session. Prom went on as planned on May 14, senior farewell and graduation all commenced without skipping a beat as if four students weren't just shot on school grounds. I can only imagine what my classmates felt and went through having to return to school that Monday with the main entrance of the school riddled with bullet holes in the brick walls and boarded up windows from broken glass. 'The shooting drastically changed my life in multiple ways: physically, mentally, spiritually and emotionally. I suffered two gunshot wounds: one to the back of the neck, the other to the left shoulder, which traveled through my chest cavity, hitting my spine and leaving me paralysed. It destroyed my collegiate athlete dreams. I had to learn how to live life navigating a wheelchair. Due to my paralysis, I had to figure out how I was going to financially provide for myself and a potential family: how and where I was going to live. I had to figure out what living a productive life following trauma and paralysis would look like without an example to model after. 'I am always on high alert when I am in public spaces. I do not like being in the middle of large crowds. In public spaces, I usually position myself to where I can have a wide vantage point. I hate loud unexpected popping noises. When I hear of other mass shootings, it is a real struggle to not mentally go down memory lane and relive the shooting I narrowly escaped. 'I teach my godchildren and younger cousins to never be distracted in public, to always keep their head on a swivel and practice situational awareness. I teach them the importance of communicating where they are and where they are going so in case, God forbid, something happens, someone will know where to find them. I've done significant healing mentally from the shooting, however, when a new shooting happens, it does pull back some of the Band-Aid.' -- William Tipper Thomas, III  Cindy Clement Carlson || Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 14, 2012  Cindy Clement Carlson was the librarian at Sandy Hook Elementary School when a gunman killed 26 people, 20 of them children.  'I have an all-too-American skillset for coping with the aftermath of a mass shooting. I identify deeply with the staff at Robb Elementary. I want to support them as they mark books lost in their catalog so shattered parents don't get automatic overdue notices. I want to design bookplates and paste them into the two slain teachers' favourite books. I want to sit by their side as they look to see if any books on hold were for students who died.   'I don't know - and the Robb teachers may not know yet - if they'll ever go back to their library. Although I know what they need most right now is each other and not necessarily outsiders, I can't help but identify powerfully and pragmatically with what will unfold in that school community over the next few years.' -- Cindy Clement Carlson  Shana Sweeney || Mount Pleasant High School in San Jose, California, on May 4, 1990  Shana Sweeney was 14 when a student from a nearby school fired shots at a classmate, who the shooter believed had used racial slurs against friends at the school. One of Sweeney's classmates died. Sweeney, 46, is now a chief human resources officer. 'When you have a classmate shot and killed at school, you can't leave the experience without the belief that safety is an illusion. It doesn't exist. Bullets can find you anywhere, anytime. And I wish that this was one isolated incident in my life, but we had a gunman in the parking lot at one of the places I worked violating a restraining order against domestic violence. Because of my prior experience, I helped get everyone away from the windows and locked all entrances, while the police stopped the person in the parking lot. Then in 2016, while I was with one of my children, we were in Dallas in an area of a mass shooting and under police lockdown. It just keeps happening whether it's school, work or vacation. There's never any closure. 'As a parent, when sending them off to school, I could only hope that they didn't experience anything similar. When they were in kindergarten, their school did a live active shooter drill in conjunction with the police department. There was no option to opt our kids out of school that day. It was horrible. They were huddled in the classroom with the police running around the campus and dogs barking as someone pretended to try to get into the classroom. So I had to talk to my twins, starting at the age of 5, about the reality of school shootings. No one should have to do that. Ever.  'We've had conversations about making yourself a harder target by not running in a straight line, not running through open fields but finding obstacles to provide some cover, knowing where all of the exits are, how to tune into the police scanner via the phone to hear what might be happening. We've also had conversations about living your life with no regrets because you never know what might happen and always being kind to others because you don't know what they are dealing with.  'Every time there is another school shooting, I cry. It's been 32 years and absolutely nothing has changed. Nothing.' -- Shana Sweeney  Drew Pescaro || University of North Carolina at Charlotte on April 30, 2019   At the end of Drew Pescaro's sophomore year, a gunman and former UNC student barged into a classroom and opened fire, killing two students and wounding four. Pescaro, who was 19 at the time, was shot in the back, only an inch from his spine. Pescaro is now 22 and works for the Carolina Hurricanes. 'Experiencing gun violence at a place like a school has completely shifted my perception of comfort in public spaces ever since. The only place I feel truly safe is my home and my PTSD makes it difficult to go places as common as the grocery store. Hearing arguments, a certain noise, or even smells can be extremely triggering for me and set me into panic mode. When I hear about another mass shooting, it causes me to have visual flashbacks of my own experience. It forces me to remember the physical trauma I experienced and the paralyzing fear of my potential death. I then think about how that community now has been shattered by violence and that so many people - victims, families, friends - will never be the same as a result. 'Although I have made progress in my mental recovery, I don't think I will ever truly feel closure from the shooting. I will always deal with survivor's guilt and wonder why I was one of the 'lucky' ones that lived through my experience. I also don't think I'll ever come to terms with the legal outcomes of the shooting.' -- Drew Pescaro  Lucy Sarkissian || STEM School Highlands Ranch shooting in a suburb of Denver, Colorado, on May 7, 2019  High school student Lucy Sarkissian was in eight grade when two students at her school, STEM School Highlands Ranch, opened fire, killing one student and wounding eight others. 'I was directly across the hallway from where the shooting occurred. I knew one girl who got shot through the leg and I knew one kid who got grazed with a bullet. My classroom was one of the only ones in the hallway that did not have any bullets enter the room. While I was being evacuated from the classroom by SWAT team we actually had to pass one of the shooters as he was being apprehended outside my classroom door. 'After, school became such a stressful environment for me that I ended up leaving in-person school to do online school in the second semester of my junior year. It completely changed how I exist in public space. Every time I walk into a new space, whether that be a grocery store, a movie theater or a mall, I'm constantly looking for the nearest exit and planning an escape route. 'I've developed PTSD as a result of the shooting. It's caused substantial amounts of nightmares, panic attacks and flashbacks to the shooting. I still struggle with hearing things like fireworks, balloons and thunderstorms. 'When I hear about another mass shooting, it obviously breaks my heart. I think back to last year, when 10 people died at a supermarket about 45 minutes away from my house - the King Soopers store shooting in Boulder. With it being so close to home, it really hurt. With the shooting in Texas this week, I don't have the words to describe the feelings I have about it. Mostly heartbreak for the students and family. But there's just a lot of guilt surrounding it for me. Guilt that I'm not there to do more for the survivors, that I'm not there to comfort them.' -- Lucy Sarkissian Susan Rodgers || Granite Hills High School in El Cajon, California, on March 22, 2001 Susan Rodgers was 16 years old when a former student at Granite High School opened fire at the school, wounding two teachers and three students. Today, Rodgers is a part-time seamstress, librarian and mother of two. 'My memories from that day are vivid: the looks on the other student's faces as we sat in waiting, the shocked words I shared with another student next to me after the first flurry of shots, the sounds of the news reporter's voices coming over the TV in the classroom - we were trapped there for hours and turned the TV on - and my teacher's attempts to keep us calm while clearly being rattled herself. I recognise now how young she was. 'No one at my school was killed. We were lucky? Five people were shot, including a future classmate of mine who would later show me her bullet wound scars and describe her dread about testifying at the trial. No one died, but the gunshots were real, the fear was deep, and the hours of uncertainty while trapped in a classroom were brutal. 'In the wake of the Texas shooting, I find myself consumed with grief. Because this time, I am a mother of an eight-year-old. My daughter is around the same age as the victims of the Robb Elementary shooting. I see the victim's photos from the recent shooting and I see her face in theirs. It terrifies me. I am torn up at the idea that victims of school shootings like me are now faced with the possibility of becoming parents of victims of school shootings. There has been no relief from the risk I faced in 2001 but instead it has gotten significantly worse. Now instead of a shotgun and a .22-caliber pistol - what the shooter brought to my school - the shooters bring AR-15s. I shudder to think what would have happened on my campus if the shooter had brought an automatic rifle. The victims would not have wounds, they'd be dead.' -- Susan Rodgers", "79a7299d6484ed74565290a80067a26d95185189e39daf68ea2e56b4": "Many people have experienced a migraine attack and don't know it - likely because the signs aren't always so obvious. Some symptoms are obvious, like vision changes, sensitivity to light, and of course, the all-consuming headache. But during a migraine attack - even before the pain sets in - parts of the brain are losing function, which can affect other areas of your body.  This is how symptoms can seem unrelated. And if you experience chronic migraines (more than half the days of the month), you will experience symptoms well beyond the course of the incident. Below are a few sneaky signs to look out for, plus some other important migraine notes to keep in mind. Confusion, brain fog or loss of speech If you've ever been unable to find the right words, you've abruptly lost the ability to express yourself, or you completely forgot what you were talking about mid-sentence, this could be a scary (but common) migraine symptom.  'Difficulty with speech, memory loss, confusion [are some of the most] surprising symptoms of migraine,' says Dr Medhat Mikhael, a pain management specialist and a medical director at the Spine Health Center at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in California.  Dr Andrew Blumenfeld, a double board-certified neurologist and psychiatrist in San Diego explains that migraines can lead to dysfunction in the language centres of the brain, resulting in a loss of being able to express yourself.  'In the cortex - where language and vocabulary are stored - that part of the brain is switching off during this phase of the migraine,' Blumenfeld says. Dizziness or feeling disoriented Many patients with vertigo tend to have migraines as well, Blumenfeld says. 'There are a lot of patients in this particular population who end up also being migraine patients,' he explains. Specifically, they might have what's called 'vestibular migraines. A vestibular migraine doesn't always include a painful headache, meaning that dizziness on its own can be a symptom or can be associated with regular migraine attacks. If you have a history of migraines and occasionally have dizzy spells - even if some of those dizzy spells don't have migraine pain involved - it can still be a migraine attack, especially if there is 'no other disease to explain dizziness,' Blumenfeld explains. Fatigue Tired all the time? Migraines may be to blame. Both before and during an attack, as well as in between attacks, chronic fatigue is a symptom of chronic migraines.  'The fatigue can be physical, mental or both,' Blumenfeld says. 'You can experience cognitive slowing - slow thinking - as well as lethargy. If your brain is working slowly, and you're trying to be productive, you're going to get fatigued more quickly. It's all coming from the cortex in the brain.'  If fatigue is a major symptom for you, Blumenfeld says treating migraines properly can help you get some of your energy back. Bring up this symptom with your doctor when discussing a medication plan.  'Certain medications used to treat migraine can increase fatigue, including some of the older migraine preventative medications,' he explains. 'You might get rid of the headache, but the patient is [wiped] out.' Numbness or sensitivity 'I think the most surprising migraine symptom - that people do not recognise as such - is something called allodynia,' says Dr. Huma U. Sheikh, a board-certified neurologist with subspecialty training in headache medicine from Harvard-Brigham and Women's Hospital. 'This is a symptom where ordinary touch can begin to feel irritating or painful.' She says that if you've ever felt like your 'hair hurts,' or you're suddenly sensitised to a necklace or glasses that you wear regularly, this could be 'due to hyper-sensitisation of the nerves that begin to portray normal sensations as painful.' Anxiety and depression Anxiety and depression are 'very common in migraine, and genetically linked -- these conditions run in families,' Blumenfeld says. 'In the period between attacks, [many people with migraines] tend to get a lot of anxiety - you may be anxious about the next attack, but you may have anxiety and panic attacks independent of worrying about the headache.' 'If you look at the incidents of anxiety and depression, the more frequent the migraines are, the greater the association,' he continues. 'In chronic migraine patients, you see anxiety and depression more than a third of the time.'  Digestive distress and nausea Nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea can be connected to migraines, both as symptoms themselves as well as in the form of a comorbid condition, Blumenfeld says.  'In migraine attacks, what has been shown is that the emptying of the stomach is delayed, [known as] gastric stasis,' he adds. That can lead to those feelings of nausea and stomach problems. Chocolate cravings Before any pain sets in, there's a first phase of a migraine attack called the premonitory phase, Blumenfeld says.  This is typically comprised of fatigue, neck discomfort, yawning, thirst, and food cravings, including chocolate cravings, he adds, carefully pointing out that the chocolate in this instance is 'a craving and not a trigger.' So if you suddenly have a hankering for a brownie or are ready to inhale a bag of M&Ms, this could be a warning. The craving, alongside the other symptoms of this phase, may help you to identify an oncoming attack before the blinding pain commences, giving you an opportunity to find medication. Nasal congestion Many migraine attacks begin with nasal congestion, said Maureen A. Moriarty, a headache specialist and current fellow of the American Headache Society. Stimulation of pain pathways in the trigeminal nerve - which is part of your nervous system - creates the congestion, she explains.  'Unfortunately, many people will often become dependent on decongestants in the attempt to alleviate this symptom,' Moriarty says. 'Not recognising this as part of the migraine, they fail to mention the symptom to their provider. It is important to let your provider know if nasal congestion precedes a headache. Control of migraine attacks can control this symptom.' What Now?  Ideally, you'll want to get to a neurologist as soon as possible, but Blumenfeld recognises that this can be an arduous process. Not many specialists are accessible, and symptoms can often be red herrings for other conditions.  There are many cases where it can be hard to pinpoint which experience is a symptom caused by a migraine attack and which ones are simply existing alongside it (known as comorbidities).  For example, there can be crossover between symptoms and comorbidities, such as anxiety and depression. Migraines can cause depression, and depression can contribute to a risk for a migraine attack. This may mean doctors could have to treat you for multiple conditions, which is why it's important to find someone you trust who is willing to detail an appropriate plan tailored to your situation and needs. Whatever you do, don't stick with a physician who is making you feel like you're just 'dealing with a headache.' 'It's not your fault; this is a genetic condition,' Blumenfeld says. 'Tell your doctor you think you have migraines.'", "61a029d618d8fd35f0601292d6b5fb060a0e3808c203fb96bd9f9b69": "Downing Street has not yet identified who in No.10 treated cleaning and security staff in an 'unacceptable' way, a cabinet minister has admitted. In her report into partygate rule breaking, Sue Gray revealed people working in No.10 had 'witnessed or been subjected to behaviours' which 'they had felt concerned about but at times felt unable to raise properly'. 'I was made aware of multiple examples of a lack of respect and poor treatment of security and cleaning staff. This was unacceptable,' she said. Speaking to Sky News on Sunday morning, Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary, was asked if those responsible for 'abusing' staff had been found. 'I have to say, not as far as I'm aware,' he said. 'I don't think anybody is aware of exactly who committed that in the first place.' In a HuffPost UK report into what happened, some staff said they felt 'battered and bruised' by the 'rudeness' they had experienced. Gray's report detailed how lockdown busting parties saw wine spilled up the walls, a fight break out and someone be sick. Lewis said it was 'abhorrent' that cleaning staff, who had to deal with the aftermath of parties, were treated in this way. 'We are one team working together for the benefit of the country, whatever your role in it is, it is an important part and people should be treated with respect,' he said. The prime minister is understood to have carried out 'a tour' of Downing Street following the revelations to speak to members of staff including security guards, those in the post room and IT.  On Thursday he came down from his flat to speak to the cleaners in private, sources said.

Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary, was asked on Sunday if Johnson would survive a no confidence vote. 'Yes, but I would go further,' he told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme. 'I don't think we are in that space.' Lewis also said the prime minister would be able to continue even if the Conservatives lost next month's Wakefield and Tiverton and Honiton by-elections. 'No, I don't think so,' he said when asked if defeat at the hands of the voters on June 23 would put Johnson's position in peril. 'I equally don't think we will lose those two by-elections,' he added. A number of Tory MPs have publicly demanded Johnson resign as PM following the Sue Gray report into partygate. More than 20 MPs have publicly stated that they no longer support the prime minister. Calling for a leadership contest, Steve Brine, the MP for Winchester, said he could no longer 'defend the indefensible'. In a statement he said: 'Rule makers cannot be law-breakers.' Treasury minister John Glen stopped short of calling for a change of leader, but has also warned him he is in 'yellow card territory'. Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tories, will be obliged to order a confidence vote if he receives 54 letters demanding one.

It comes after The Sunday Times reported details of an alleged Downing Street flat party were removed from the investigation into rule Covid breaking. The paper reported Gray had pressure placed on her by senior members of Boris Johnson's team to remove certain details and names. In an interview on the BBC's Sunday Morning programme, Lewis was asked to give a 'cast-iron guarantee' Gray was put under 'no pressure whatsoever'. The Northern Ireland secretary said: 'Not only am I confident of that, but I know Sue Gray well enough to know pressure on Sue Gray would not have an outcome. 'Sue Gray is not somebody who is pressured into doing things by anybody,' he said. 'She has put out a report that she is happy with, that she is confident about.' Lewis added he believed the senior civil servant, who on Wednesday delivered her 37-page report into events held in Downing Street and Whitehall during England's lockdowns, had been given the 'freedom and the space' she needed. According to The Sunday Times, the so-called 'Abba party' held in the prime minister's flat on November 13 2020 was 'tweaked' by Johnson's chief-of-staff Steve Barclay on the eve of publication. It is alleged an earlier draft of Gray's report referred to music being played and stated at what time the gathering ended, but that the information was redacted. Gray found that the prime minister - who is facing growing calls from Conservative MPs to resign over his handling of the so-called partygate affair - did attend the mid-lockdown gathering along with five special advisers, with 'food and alcohol available'. However, she halted her work having only collected 'limited' information when the Metropolitan Police began their investigation. There was no mention in her report of The Winner Takes It All and other Abba songs reportedly heard blaring from the Downing Street residence after the departure of Dominic Cummings, who was formerly the PM's chief adviser, was announced amid a bitter power struggle. Carrie Johnson was reportedly at the November event but was not named by Gray in relation to the flat gathering. The official said she had not long been investigating the evening when Scotland Yard began its criminal investigation and, once the police work was complete, 'concluded it was not appropriate or proportionate' to advance her own inquiries. It was also reported that senior civil servants, including the head of the Civil Service Simon Case, No.10 permanent secretary Samantha Jones and Alex Chisholm, permanent secretary in the Cabinet Office, looked to lobby Gray to persuade her not to name individuals who attended the gatherings - events for which some government employees have subsequently been fined for attending. It comes as the number of Tory MPs to have publicly declared they have submitted letters of no confidence in the prime minister continued to tick upwards. Former health minister Steve Brine and Anne Marie Morris became the latest to announce they have called for a vote on the future of Mr Johnson's premiership.

The Rise Of Skywalker proved to be among the most divisive of all the Star Wars films upon its release in 2019, with the Sith Lord's shocking return - despite him seemingly meeting his demise in Return Of The Jedi - among fans' many gripes. 'It was nice to know that I wasn't dead. Well, he wouldn't be, would he?' Ian said during a recent panel event, as reported by /Film. 'A lot of people said, 'You can't bring him back, he was dead! Did you see that fall? How could anyone survive that?'. Excuse me. He's the Emperor of the Universe.' He continued: 'Anyway, nobody's going to tell me he wouldn't have had a Plan B, should someone - unlikely though he may have thought -manage to semi-destroy him. 'And of course he had the best operational ward team of surgeons, they were very small but they were very thorough, maybe you remember from the film. And he had the best that money could buy, that enforcement could produce. And he also had that marvelous galactic wheelchair, which was a huge advantage.' According to /Film, Ian then revealed that his character was initially supposed to have looked 'more worse for wear' in The Rise Of Skywalker, which would have made sense after what he'd been through. However, these design plans - which apparently included 'a bad arm and tubes coming out of his head' - were eventually scrapped in order to make 'the sophisticated machinery keeping the Emperor together less visible'.  Since the most recent Star Wars trilogy came to an end, the franchise has begun a string of new TV spin-offs, which have been available to stream on Disney+. As well as The Mandalorian and The Book Of Boba Fett, Ewan McGregor is currently taking the lead in a new show about Obi-Wan Kenobi, which launched on Friday. It has also been announced that the next film released under the Star Wars umbrella will be helmed by Taika Waititi and hit cinemas in 2023.

AJ was one of the first celebs to be announced for Strictly in 2021, and was a frontrunner throughout the show thanks to her impressive moves. However, the Big Breakfast host has admitted that her journey to the Strictly dance floor wasn't exactly a smooth one. 'I asked them in 2020 if I could do it and they said no,' she told The Sun.  'There are always those people that get asked every year and say: 'I just haven't found the time.' That was not me - I had not been asked every year!' AJ went on to say that she believes she manifested her involvement in last year's run. 'I really do manifest hard,' she explained. 'I spoke it into existence to the point that it actually happened. 'At the beginning of 2021, I sat down with my agent and said: 'I want to do Strictly Come Dancing. I have to do it.' And I could see myself doing it.' Throughout the series, AJ received high scores from the judges and praise from viewers, making it all the way to the final alongside Rose Ayling-Ellis and John Whaite. Unfortunately, she was forced to pull out at the eleventh hour due to an injury. Admitting she felt 'really angry at my ankle' at first, AJ told The Sun she coped by trying to focus on the positives. 'I was disappointed. And then I did a U-turn and thought: 'You did what you needed to do. You got me as far as I needed to get',' she said. 'I was literally living the dream. Strictly was an overwhelmingly positive experience. It was the first time that I was introduced to a whole new audience of people who were accepting me for me -- flaws and all. That felt really special. 'Ultimately, I was part of Strictly in the most inclusive year that has ever been. I feel really honoured to get to know Rose and John and the whole cast. I feel like I've got a wider family now. And I feel really lucky, even though it didn't end the way that I wanted it to, that I was able to learn to dance and be myself.' After serving as the UK's points announcer during the Eurovision Song Contest earlier this month, AJ will now be seen in action as the new host of Channel 4's The Bridge.

Earlier this week, it was confirmed by Ray's team that he had died in his sleep while on location in the Dominican Republic, where he had been filming a new movie. In the days since, his former collaborators Robert DeNiro, Martin Scorsese and Kevin Costner were among those to pay their respects to the actor. Posting on Instagram, Jacy shared her own tribute to Ray, remembering him as the 'most beautiful man' that she'd ever known. 'My life these past couple of years have been nothing but truly magical,' Jacy wrote, alongside a montage of photos of herself and Ray. 'Ray and I share a deep love that I will cherish in my heart forever. 'We laughed daily and we were inseparable. The chemistry was wild in the best way. He was everything in the world to me and we couldn't get enough of each other. The kind of real love that one dreams of. 'He was the most beautiful person inside and out that I've ever known...and even that is an understatement.'

In 1986, he appeared in Something Wild, which bagged him his first Golden Globe nomination for his performance as Ray Sinclair. From there, he portrayed baseball player Shoeless Joe Jackson in Field Of Dreams and went on to land his most prolific role as real-life mobster Henry Hill in Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas.

Every week, hearing Tolani Shoneye (Tolly), Milena Sanchez and Audrey Indome through my Soundcloud account brought me joy while I struggled to finish my dissertation. In the years since, The Receipts Podcast has become a safe space for women of colour. It's the place we go to laugh, cry and hear general insights into the day to day lives of other women like us.  Though the podcast mainly focuses on sex and relationships, the trio of hosts also touch on issues like race, religion and mental health. So when the news dropped that they'd be releasing a book, myself and thousands of others were thrilled. Keep The Receipts - which came out last year and is now available in paperback - spans many of the topics the team are now famous for. But it also has a whole chapter dedicated to female friendship. HuffPost UK sat down with two-thirds of gang, Tolly and Audrey, to find out what they really want us to take away about love, sisterhood and the bonds with women we make along the way.  You can never have too many friends 'I think the book is a love letter to all the Black women that have loved me, because those are the people who have made me exactly who I am today,' says Tolly.  'They've made such a huge difference in who I am. Being African, there's not many conversations that I was privileged to have with my parents or even my older siblings. So I message my girlfriends because they've carved a space for me that's just mine and I appreciate that so much.' Audrey echos this and says 'my friends are so important to me and I remember people would try and shame me about having so many friends. I've spun that on it's head and I think it's a positive thing. 'The book was really an ode to my friends, for being able to give them something in print to say: 'This is how you've helped shape my life'. During the friendship chapter, I named all my friends individually and said what it is that they mean to me.'  Friendship break-ups cut deep  Even though female friendships can be a source of joy, we all know the feeling of going through a tough friendship break-up. Tolly speaks about one of her experiences in the book. 'We stopped speaking because of a boy and it was just silly. I'd been friends with her since I was like 10 years old,' she says. 'I'm really sad that we both don't get to be in each other's biggest celebratory moments.' Audrey emphasises how she prides herself on maintaining friendships, so when one ends, she struggles not to see it as a personal failure.  'Friendship break-ups can be really painful and I've had a few friendship break-ups where I had to look at myself and ask myself if I was the problem,' she says. 'No one's perfect and sometimes these things just happen, but it's sad.' But it's never too late to make new connections The podcast started in 2016 and the trio now have a dedicated audience of international fans. It's hard to believe that prior to the show, the three hosts didn't know each other. But it's clear Tolly, Audrey and Milena have built a friendship of their own. As a listener, you can hear the bond between the three get tighter as the episodes progress. They start to share private jokes or begin recounting something they've experienced together. The podcast and the book really highlight how you can build and grow new friendships at any age. 'I feel like we've made a conscious decision to be friends,' says Audrey. 'In as much as we need that authenticity to do the podcast we could have just been performative and just been colleagues. But we've actually made the effort to be friends and it's come so naturally as well.' Being vulnerable (even with friends) isn't always easy  The hosts' vulnerability on the podcast is one of the reason's why it's so popular. They never hold back from being open and honest, which is why so many listeners can relate to their experiences. But Audrey and Tolly both admit that vulnerability doesn't always come easily. They found they had to dig even deeper to lay themselves bare on the pages of the book. 'It was hard drawing on things I hadn't already spoken about on the podcast,' says Audrey. 'At this point, we'd done the podcast for five years and I feel like I told every single nugget of my life and wanted to be really conscious about not repeating myself.' Tolly adds: 'I think all of us spoke about things that weren't really spoken about before on the podcast. I mentioned my father passing, Milena spoke about sexual assault and Audrey touched on her marriage. I think it was the next step of really being vulnerable, which was quite hard.' You can't change mistakes, but you can share them  As a big fan of the podcast, I was pleasantly surprised with how different the book was to the episodes I've grown so accustomed to. Though it has familiar themes, I was able learn more about each woman and reflect more on my own experiences.  It's this cyclical feeling of sisterhood that makes The Receipts so special.  'I feel like I haven't lived the colourful life I've lived and made all these mistakes for no reason. I want young women, especially younger Black women, to read the book and know they aren't alone in their experiences,' says Audrey. 'I feel like we were all quite purposeful and said solid statements that people can resonate with. Especially the affirmations page, I didn't have anything like that growing up and I wish I did.' Tolly adds: 'I want anyone who's reading the book to feel like they have company. I want people to feel like they have someone who just gets it and understands them.' Keep The Receipts by Tolani Shoneye, Milena Sanchez and Audrey Indome is out now in paperback.

With less than two hours to go before he had to face MPs in the Commons, the prime minister and his team scoured print-outs of the report. Sources said the PM was 'really shocked' by some of the detail which exposed a pattern of 'rudeness' towards key workers. Among juicy details of boozy parties, the senior civil servant lifted the lid on a 'lack of respect and poor treatment' of security and cleaning staff. Workers, some of whom will be the lowest paid in Downing Street, had been left to deal with the fallout of drunken lockdown busting parties. It was not a good look for a prime minister who owes much of his 2019 general election victory to working class voters. However, Johnson and those around him insist he had 'no knowledge' of the goings-on outlined in the report.  Gray's investigation outlined booze-fuelled fights, vomiting, damage to property, wine-stained walls and karaoke machines on standby.  She said the morning after a Christmas knees-up on December 18, 2020, a cleaner 'noted that there has been red wine spilled on one wall and on a number of boxes of photocopier paper'. Gray criticised the 'unacceptable' way in which staff were left feeling 'unable to raise properly' their concerns in relation to law-breaking parties. 'I found that some staff have witnessed or been subjected to behaviour at work which they had felt concerned about,' she said. It had also been reported by the BBC that Downing Street security officers, known as custodians, had been 'laughed at' by partying press officers when they tried to close an event down. It was little wonder that Johnson and his team wanted to get on the front foot of the issue after the report dropped on Wednesday.  Apologising in the Commons, the prime minister said he was 'appalled' by the treatment of the security and cleaning staff and that he expected the culprits to say sorry too.  During the ensuing debate, he described the revelations as 'intolerable' but insisted: 'This is the first I've seen of the detailed criticisms of civil servants for that abuse.' Johnson then returned to Downing Street and went to see the custodians at the front door of No.10 to personally say sorry for what had happened. Sources told HuffPost UK that Johnson told them he had no idea about what they had put up with and asked them how they felt about it all. It is understood some of them said it was all part of the job while others admitted they felt 'battered and bruised' by the 'rudeness' they had experienced. The prime minister then carried out 'a tour' of Downing Street to speak to other members of staff including other security guards, those in the post room and IT. And on Thursday he came down from his flat to speak to the cleaners in private, sources said.  The PM's allies claim he was 'badly let down' by staff - most of whom they say no longer work in Downing Street. But, while they insist the situation has improved, the stinging revelations are not going away.  On Friday afternoon ministerial aide Paul Holmes announced his resignation the same day cleaners staged a protest outside Downing Street. Tory MP Holmes, an aide to Priti Patel, said his work as a constituency MP had been 'tarnished by the toxic culture' in No.10. In particular Holmes highlighted the 'disappointing and unacceptable' treatment of staff and cleaners, adding: 'It clearly showed a culture in No.10 that was distasteful.' It comes as sources describe an aggressive and misogynistic 'boys club' operating at the heart of No.10. Others working in Downing Street also outlined allegations of harassment and sexism. 'They tended to be rude because it was late at night and they were pissed and they never wanted the party to stop,' one said.  Some point to the Vote Leave loyalists, now largely ousted from No.10, who have previously been blamed for fostering a toxic laddish culture across government as well as allegedly briefing against Johnson's wife Carrie Symonds and calling her 'Princess Nut Nut'. Others point to a clubby 'culture of entitlement' that predates Johnson's era. 'There were real issues there, even going back to Theresa May's time,' a member of the PCS union working in the Cabinet Office said. 'There's definitely a culture of senior people seeing themselves as not having to follow the same rules as everyone else, I think they call it 'exceptionalism'. 'They're the exception to the rule, the rest of the civil service has to follow a thing called the civil service code but they don't feel they need to do that because they're No.10 and all that goes out the window. 'So because people felt like that, inevitably, that means there was inappropriate behaviour and bullying. 'I know the phrase 'toxic culture' maybe gets overused, but it really was like that.' They said people were afraid to speak out as it could prove to be 'career suicide' and added: 'When you go to work in No.10, you expect it to be stressful, it's high profile, it's going to be demanding, probably long hours, and probably really tight deadlines and so on. 'But this was something different. There was a kind of nastiness to it. Real kind of white male dominance.' They said the revelations in the Sue Gray report did not come as a surprise, adding: 'We've known that for years.' The treatment of cleaners and security staff has sparked fury from MPs, journalists and celebrities.  Labour Party deputy leader Angela Rayner said the treatment of service staff revealed much about the 'disrespectful attitude' to working people at the 'highest levels' of the government. She told HuffPost UK: 'It's an echo of the notorious Bullingdon Club of which Boris Johnson was a member, famous for trashing restaurants and smashing wine bottles before later handing a wad of cash from their overflowing wallets to the servants who had to clean up their shameful mess. 'The dehumanising treatment of service workers as worthless and invisible exposed in Boris Johnson's rotten Downing Street is emblematic of the practices that have been allowed to fester in workplaces up and down this country over a decade. 'Whether it's inadequate sick pay, the basic denial of job security and respect at work or the erosion of basic rights at work, this government has failed working people in Downing Street and beyond.' The Lib Dems called on Johnson to pay back Downing Street cleaners out of his own pocket. Chief whip Wendy Chamberlain said: 'Johnson's apology just doesn't cut it. If he was truly sorry, we would take personal responsibility and offer the cleaners a pay rise out of his own pocket.' Telegraph journalist Christopher Hope said Gray's description of 'entitled staff boozing away' while dismissing concerns of cleaners and security staff was 'incredibly damaging'. Botanist James Wong added: 'Just gotta say, whatever your point of view, people who treat cleaners and security staff disrespectfully are the absolute worst.' Actress Sian Reese-Williams added: 'The bit about the cleaners and security staff is so gross. It tells us everything we need to know.' Devi Sridhar, professor of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, added: 'You can tell a lot about a person and their upbringing by how they treat others especially cleaners, security guards, supermarket staff and waiters/waitresses.' Former Conservative chancellor George Osborne also came to their defence, saying: 'One of the things I remember most about living in Downing Street was how amazingly friendly, generous and kind the team who keep the place going are - the cleaners, custodians, front of house and the police. 'Working all hours, not very well-paid but always there for us.'  On Friday cleaners gathered outside Downing Street to protest against the treatment of low-paid staff. The event was organised by United Voices of the World (UVW), a union which represents cleaners and security guards in government buildings. Petros Elia, general secretary, said they were not in the least bit surprised by the revelations in the Gray report. 'We have many members who work as cleaners and security guards and these workers face disrespect on a daily basis in offices across London, not just in Downing Street,' he added. The group has also worked to highlight the death of Emanuel Gomes, a father who was an outsourced cleaner in the Ministry of Justice and died in April 2020 after working for five days with suspected Covid symptoms. Jim Melvin, chairman of the industry voice the British Cleaning Council, said cleaners had been treated with 'arrogance' and 'disrespect'. He added: 'It is absolutely appalling and upsetting to hear that they were being treated with such contempt by people who sit within government or the civil service and who frankly should know better.' The BCC is formally requesting a meeting with government to discuss what has been done.  The Cleaners and Allied Independent Workers Union said they were 'deeply concerned' and highlighted the work of cleaners who were 'on the front line' during the pandemic. However, they said they were 'encouraged' that steps had been taken to introduce more accessible means for cleaners and security staff to raise concerns. Meanwhile, the Cleaners Union said they were 'appalled' that underpaid and overworked staff were 'literally left to clean up the mess at 10 Downing Street'. In a statement, they called for a 'drastic cultural shift' in the way cleaners are treated and added: 'They are not only left to clean up the dirt but are treated as such. This is unacceptable.' No.10 has been approached for comment. In a previous statement, a spokesman said: 'The prime minister has been appalled by the findings in Sue Gray's report around behaviour towards treatment of security and cleaning staff. 'He has personally apologised to these dedicated members of staff, expects anyone who behaved in that way to apologise, and we are committed to addressing the full findings and recommendations in the report.'", "29efde340387d718b67b97411a5f4ba08933a916743f98be226e7890": "Rylan Clark had a special message for fans on the 10th anniversary of his X Factor audition. Back in 2012, the then-unknown TV presenter made a memorable appearance on The X Factor, where he auditioned for judges Louis Walsh, Rita Ora, Tulisa and Gary Barlow. Meeting the judges for the first time on stage at The O2, he told a somewhat-unimpressed Gary about his work in a Take That tribute band overseas, before delivering an unusual dance version of Des'ree's Kissing You as his audition piece. While Gary didn't want Rylan to continue in the competition - a theme with drudged on throughout his X Factor journey - the other three judges were sold, and put him through to the next stage of the competition. Looking back on Saturday, Rylan tweeted a montage of himself on stage at The O2, sporting a long bleach blond hairstyle that's not been seen since. 'Dunno how, dunno why, but today marks 10 years since that audition,' he wrote. 'Thanks for a decade to remember. No regrets.' Rylan's time on The X Factor was notable for a number of reasons, including his performances of songs Gangnam Style, a medley of Spice Girls medley and Take That's Back For Good, as well as his infamous crying fit at Judges' Houses. Although he was considered a novelty act at the time, Rylan has gone on to become one of X Factor's most famous contestants ever. After winning Celebrity Big Brother a month after X Factor ended, he landed a job hosting spin-off show Big Brother's Bit On The Side, as well as presenting segments on This Morning.  There was also a full-circle moment when Rylan hosted a series of X Factor's companion show The Xtra Factor. Nowadays, the presenter has his own show on Radio 2 and fronts Strictly Come Dancing's sister show It Takes Two, with his other credits including reboots of Ready Steady Cook and Supermarket Sweep, as well as the short-lived ITV gameshow Babushka.", "b0fecab03382b0431d93001ef5721462dad7fd44f2b549dd8ba7b673": "In most cultures, you're a fully-fledged adult at 18. You're expected to look after yourself, pay your own way and, crucially, move out of home. But it's doesn't play out like that in all families.  In South Asian communities, at 18 you're still very much likely to be living with your parents. This only changes once you're getting married or, in some situations, if you need to move for work or distant universities - though even these circumstances can be a challenge to the status quo. So when young, unmarried South Asians, particularly women, flee the nest of their own accord, it can come as a shock, a disappointment even, to parents who, out of love and fear, want to hold on to their children for as long as possible. When I, as an unmarried 27-year-old, told my parents that I was moving out of their east London home to a flatshare on the other side of the river (I know, why did I do it? Think of the rent prices!), they were saddened to hear it.  I'd meticulously prepped a list of practical reasons why it would be good for me - closer to work, more space - and after some coaxing, they were pacified and allowed me to move.  But the decision did come with some heavy feelings: guilt on my part for 'abandoning' them, and not sticking around my siblings, with whom I love spending time; and some shame on theirs. They shrouded the news in secrecy from others in the community in case they were considered bad parents.  Women moving out to prioritise their own space, mental health or enjoyment is seldom talked about in our community, and those who do manage it can sometimes be ostracised.  That's been the case for Malia*, a fashion designer, 27, from London. Having grown up in Blackpool, when she wanted to move to the capital for university, she was met with resistance but it was eventually accepted. Then, after graduation, Malia decided to permanently move to the capital as it had more opportunities for fashion.  'I knew broaching the subject with my father would be tough,' she tells HuffPost UK. 'And it was. He didn't want me to leave as he was worried about 'what would people say'- the classic desi parent line.' 'The worry here is that my reputation will be tarnished, people will make assumptions about me that I've strayed from religion or that I'm on drugs or sleeping around. I explained how being out of the loop of the industry and the whole situation was negatively affecting me but gained no sympathy,' says Malia. 'In the end, I had to move out without the support of my family. As a result, I was ostracised and isolated from them for a year.'  In this time, Malia continued to miss her family, especially her siblings who she is close to, though, she did have their support. And thankfully, things did ease with her dad. 'In the end my father apologised for his behaviour and our relationship is much improved.' But to placate her parents in the first place, Malia had found a middle ground - moving in with relatives to be closer to work - and it soon became clear the new living situation was't going to be sustainable either. 'Moving out of there was tougher than the initial move out of parents, I had to leave because one relative was suffering from an addiction, whilst the other was suffering from depression as well as being verbally and occasionally physically abusive. This home environment was something that I wasn't used to, so it really affected my mental wellbeing. I had to get out.' Since then, she has found accommodation with a friend and is enjoying having her own space, especially with the knowledge she has her parents' support. For writer Lubna Hoque, 27, from south London, the choice to leave home also courted controversy in her family, but she was firm in her decision. Though she felt initially rejected when she moved out in 2014, eight years later, her parents have come to terms with it.  'Even after all these years there is a lot of stigma around my not living at home,' she tells HuffPost UK. 'I didn't have any fears over telling them as I knew they wouldn't stand in my way, but I knew that my choice would come with consequences that may not be easy on me. When I left, they lost their power over me and I gained a new type of freedom. I had little to no communication with my family for a period of time.' Hoque says while this estrangement was difficult, it was needed to maintain boundaries and ensure that she could begin to live her life autonomously.  'I did not contact them as I didn't feel welcome to and I had to find ways to stand on my own two feet without them. The lack of communication was a boundary drawn up to help assert a sense of privacy. In hindsight, I can see it was necessary so that we could begin again from our new respective positions.' Hoque appreciates that when she made her first foray into freedom, things were a bit different in the community. Even eight years ago, female autonomy wasn't as accepted as it is now. But there is still a long way to go. 'Though it is more common now and other women in my extended family have left the family home without being married - there remains this idea that a woman who does this is somehow tarnished,' she says. Reflecting on the reasons behind this, she says: 'It is a dishonouring of the traditions and rituals. I have found in conversation with other women (and men) with similar experiences over the years, that leaving the family home was often times synonymous with experiencing an exile (physically/mentally/both). 'I don't think I've fully recovered from it yet, it just matters less because I have a wonderful support network and love in my life.' Hoque is glad to see the situation become more normalised and hopes parents and family leaders realise what makes the home situation difficult in the first place - and that they might take steps to either ameliorate it or allow their children to find their own space, whether in the home or by moving out of it. While no one wants to hurt their parents or sever connections to family and community, for many young people, living in an environment where they aren't free to do as they wish is restrictive, stifling and harmful to their mental health. And for parents, knowing your children would rather pay hundreds of pounds to support themselves instead of live at home, rent-free in many cases, is a hard pill to swallow. No one wants to feel unwanted. But finding a compromise might be necessary: effort from adult-aged children to continue to play a part in family life, and greater acceptance from their parents. After all, if you accept it, they may just come (back).", "48b3f12ac28de8299e5970362180aa17e601d227e0d0a19cf7ca1e34": "Stranger Things is finally back, but viewers in the United States will now see a warning before they dive back into the world of Hawkins, the Upside Down and beyond.  A message has been added to the fourth season of the hit Netflix show in the wake of the mass shooting at a Texas elementary school that left 19 children and two teachers dead:  'We decided to add the card given the proximity of the premiere to this tragedy -- and because the opening scene is very graphic,' a spokesperson for the streaming video company told The Hollywood Reporter. The warning will only be shown to viewers in the US. Meanwhile, Stranger Things' description was also updated to note 'graphic violence involving children,' which may be an understatement given what's happen to some of the young characters on the show since its 2016 release.  The fourth season of Stranger Things will be released in two parts. The first seven episodes are available now while the remaining two will hit screens on July 1.  Netflix has also ordered a fifth and final season of the show.

The Great British Bake Off star is the only member of the current cast to have appeared in every series, as well as crossing the pond to judge various American versions of the show. As a result of this, he's arguably become Bake Off's most recognisable figure, though he has admitted this has come with its setbacks. In a wide-ranging interview with The Times (PS), Paul admitted he had issues with paparazzi photographers coming to his home - even during lockdown. 'The paps didn't care about the rules - they still came to my house,' he said. 'They waited on the drive till I took the bins out and then it was, 'Oi, Hollywood, you c***!' or, 'You Scouse t***!'. They need you to look up. What they really want is to get the angry shot. Well, I wouldn't give it to them. 'And one time I caught the abuse on my doorbell camera and gave it to the police. They told the photographer if he came back he'd be arrested.' When Bake Off made the jump from the BBC to Channel 4, Paul was famously the only member of the on-screen team to stay with the show, with reports in the press claiming his salary had been bumped up as a result of the move. 'I was called every name under the sun,' he recalled of that period. 'It was so horrendous, I actually cried. No one wants to be painted as the pantomime villain, especially when I was just sticking with a job I loved. But you can't kick against it. 'David Walliams actually took me aside and said, 'Mate, it's just a game. Enjoy it.' You're clickbait, basically. But it hurt me. After a while, though, I got tough. I just thought, 'OK, I'll be your bad guy'.' On how fame has affected him, he continued: 'I don't trust people anymore. I'm really wary of who gets close and I never used to be like that. In fact, I'm a hermit, whereas I used to be the life and soul of the party. 'I was always first down the bowling alley. But now quite often someone suggests going out and I'll say, 'Yeah, I'll be there,' and I don't go.' Paul added: 'There is no school that tells you how to deal with being in the public eye. And however much you think you're not going to change, it's impossible to stay the same. I defy anyone to do it.' Earlier this year, Paul was back in action with his fellow judge Prue Leith for the latest edition of the celebrity version of Bake Off.

Earlier this week, the divisive host was joined by comedian and political activist Kate Smurthwaite for a discussion about one of Piers' favourite topics (yes, that would be the Duchess of Sussex). However, after her segment on Piers Morgan Uncensored aired, Kate said that her appearance on the show wasn't quite as uncensored as its name suggested. She tweeted on Thursday night: 'Today in #MyLifeIsWeird I'm sat in the green room for Piers Morgan UNCENSORED (the producer has just told me at least three things NOT to say on air LOL #ActuallyCensored) when the other guest arrives who will be on for the second half of the show. It's JOAN COLLINS...' Piers soon contested this version of events, tweeting back 45 minutes later: 'I just checked and nobody tried to censor you - we don't censor guests, that's the point of the show.' 'Yes I was,' Kate then responded. 'Great, have me on again and I'll say all the things I was told not to say.' In a follow-up column in The Mirror, Kate claimed: 'The producer pencilled the slot into my diary last week and rang in the morning to let me know what topics would be discussed and ask what my views were. Standard procedure. 'After their morning meeting, I had a confirmation call too. They were looking forward to having me on. The only thing was... they'd like me not to mention a couple of the things I had said in our earlier conversation. A remarkable request for a show that is literally called 'uncensored'.' She continued: 'They didn't want me to get 'too personal' with Morgan. They didn't want me criticising or seeking to explain his 'vindictive obsession' with [Meghan Markle]. 'The main thing they didn't want me to say was: 'You know that no matter how many hours you spend slagging her off, she's still not going to shag you?'. True. Funny. Insightful. What's not to love?' Referring to Piers' tweet, Kate added: 'If, as he has subsequently claimed on Twitter, there was no effort to censor me, his producers would not have warned me beforehand to not get 'too personal' with Piers when discussing the topic of Meghan. 'I'd like to discuss his childish obsession with Markle. And then whilst I'm about it his nasty attitude towards some other celebrities and the way that the right wing media will cry censorship when it suits them and participate in the exact same thing when it doesn't.

Amid reports of struggling ratings at Talk TV, Piers previously tweeted: 'Linear TV [is] increasingly irrelevant [compared] to total eyeball potential for a global show like this, especially with younger viewers who don't really watch TV any more.' However, this somewhat contradicts what he repeatedly used to say during his tenure on ITV's Good Morning Britain, when he would often goad BBC rival Dan Walker over their respective viewing figures.

And what now? It's six months since the Daily Mirror first broke the partygate scandal. On December 1, 2021, the paper triggered a series of events that could still very well lead to Boris Johnson having to resign as prime minister. The Gray report was delivered to Downing Street at 10am on Wednesday. According to No.10, this is the first time the PM got sight of it. Although one of his officials, charged with staff welfare, was given an early glimpse. It was published online at 11am. While there was no smoking gun or huge new revelations - most had already been uncovered by the media - the details, written in Gray's cold civil service style, were striking.  During the lockdown busting gatherings, someone was sick from excessive drinking. A karaoke machine was wheeled in. The parties went on until 4am. Red wine was spilled up the walls. Social distancing 'did not happen'. Lee Cain, the No.10 communications director in May 2020, in one of the most understated whatsapp messages in Westminster history, warned a colleague that holding a boozy garden party might be 'somewhat of a comms risk'. But Martin Reynolds, Johnson's now departed principal private secretary, hoped 'we seem to have got away with' it. They did not. Fresh outrage was also caused by evidence that Downing Street cleaners, who had to deal with the mess from parties, and security guards were treated with a 'lack of respect' by No.10 staff. 'This was unacceptable,' Gray concluded. Johnson used a Commons statement to apologise. 'I am humbled by what has happened,' he told MPs. A sense of shame that might have been more effective if he had not gleefully branded Keir Starmer 'Sir Beer Korma' a few minutes later. The prime minister then held a press conference to say sorry to the country. 'I renew my wholehearted apology for the gathering in the Cabinet Room on the 19 June 2020 - my birthday for which I received a fixed penalty notice,' he said. But he defended having raised a glass of wine at Cain's leaving do. Giving a speech in person to say goodbye to a departing colleague, while the public was banned from saying goodbye to dying relatives, was his 'duty', he said. It was work. And therefore permitted under the rules. Having faced reporters, Johnson then crossed the road to parliament to face Tory MPs. After all his fate ultimately lies with them. He apologised again. But also is said to have rejected the suggestion alcohol be completely banned in No.10 on the basis Winston Churchill drank a lot and won WWII. Throughout the partygate scandal, Johnson has repeatedly asked everyone to 'move on' to issues that, he says, the public care about more. On Thursday, coincidentally the day after the Gray report dropped, Rishi Sunak announced a huge PS21bn package of financial support for people struggling with surging energy and food prices. The chancellor announced a PS400 discount on energy bills for every household in the country. There will also be a one-off PS650 payment to low-income households on benefits. Pensioners will also receive a PS300 payment in November/December. In a perhaps inevitable but still striking U-turn, it will be paid for, in part, by a windfall tax on oil and gas firms. A policy long pushed for by Labour and repeatedly voted against by Tory MPs and rejected by cabinet ministers. 'What is it about the Sue Gray report that first attracted him to a U-turn this week?,' Starmer asked Johnson in the Commons. A handful of Tory MPs have called for the prime minister to resign following the Gray report. And one parliamentary private secretary, the lowest rung on the ministerial ladder, quit the government over the 'toxic' culture in No.10. But so far the public demands from Tory MPs that Johnson stand down are a drip, drip not a gush. Although there are rumours in Westminster that rather than being spontaneous, a leading critic of Johnson has their hand on the tap. The PM survived the week but is not in the clear yet. He still has two big problems looming. The first is the the Commons privileges committee, which is set to launch an investigation into whether the prime minister misled parliament. On multiple occasions, in parliament, Johnson denied knowledge of any rule breaking in No.10. The ministerial code states that 'ministers who knowingly mislead parliament will be expected to offer their resignation'. The key word there is 'knowingly' - Johnson's defence has been that he did not think anything he did broke the laws that he had imposed on the country. But that could be a difficult line to sustain.  Even if Johnson is found guilty by the committee but manages to technically dodge the previously convention that he should resign, Tory MPs might decide they have had enough. It takes 54 of them to demand a no confidence vote in his leadership before a contest can be triggered. The number who have submitted letters is secret. Only Graham Brady, the chairman of the 19922 committee of backbench Tories, knows the true number. The other crunch point for Johnson is June 23, which will see two by-elections on the same day. Wakefield in Yorkshire and Tiverton and Honiton in Devon. Both are currently held by the Conservatives. But the party risks losing Wakefield to Labour and Tiverton to the Lib Dems A loss in Wakefield would not be ideal, given its position in the red wall, but it is probably expected. However a losing Tiverton, which has a Tory majority of 24,239, to the Lib Dems, could scare a critical mass of Conservative MPs into acting against the PM.  Rumbling on in the background is Durham Police's investigation into beergate. Starmer has been accused by the Conservatives of himself breaking lockdown rules by drinking a beer and eating a takeaway curry with staff in April 2021. The Labour leader, dubbed 'Mr Rules' by Lisa Nandy, has insisted he broke no rules. But he has promised to resign if he is issued a fine by police. It remains a, perhaps unlikely, possibility that the political storm that began with revelations that lockdown rules were broken in Downing Street could claim the career of a party leader. But not the one in No.10.", "b78286dae560eccd36ee542f7882ae5044e5dab2008ff6f63dbbb5e0": "Late nights, followed by days of bleary-eyed reading in the library. And if you made it through a Friday morning lecture, you were considered conscientious.  The world of university means hedonism, spending student loans and grants frivolously, not taking life too seriously. Or at least it used to.  For the young cohort now, that's not a reality. The 18 to 21-year-olds enrolled today have already had to grapple with a multitude of harsh realities, from the pandemic to the fallout of the Ukraine-Russia war. But now, the cost of living crisis is completely overhauling their lives. Some students have resorted to using food banks, taking multiple jobs, or taking out loans to survive. While being skint felt like a natural part of student life for many of us, youngsters now are facing a crisis like never before. In fact, according to research by network Student Beans, 71% of students have stopped socialising as much, with 49% of them skipping a meal. A further 54% said they relied on money from family and or friends. Four in five students say they have felt personally impacted by the rising cost of food shopping, and almost just as many are altering their habits just to get by. One in 20 have even started using a food bank. Other actions taken in response to the rising cost of groceries include increasing use of free food apps like OLIO, rationing food, and buying food from the reduced section to make their money go further. This is something medical student Penny Sucharitkul, 22, from Leeds, can relate to. She's noticed how food staples in low-cost supermarkets are bordering on unaffordable. 'Everything has gone up,' she tells HuffPost UK. 'I usually shop at Aldi which is the cheapest but the most basic of products have gone up, so baked beans were 30p and have gone up to 90p or PS1. Essentials like pasta are also going up. The low cost supermarkets have gone up and students with low budgets have noticed. It's exhausting.' As a medical student, Sucharitkul also needs a car to get to placements, which is another added cost. 'On top of my insurance, I have to deal with the rising cost of petrol and a few months ago, my car got broke into (they stole my NHS badge and scrubs) and it cost me PS110 to fix the locks. And then my rent went up. 'There was no negotiation with the landlord, we've been living here for three years, as good tenants, but we were bullied into signing the new contract.' Sucharitkul can also relate to missing meals. 'Most days I skip breakfast as that's another meal to prepare. I've also noticed that lots of my friends aren't going out as much, socialising is a luxury now, but it should be a basic part of uni.' In an attempt to mitigate the squeeze, 42% of students have taken on additional part-time work alongside their studies, according to the Student Beans survey, while 14% have started using a credit card.  This financial pressure is something Chiara, 20, from Newcastle has felt. 'It has impacted me mostly when buying food and going out with friends. I have several jobs and I've noticed that I'm getting shorter on money,' says the student, who chose not to share her surname.  'I feel like I have had to miss out on plans due to the increase in prices.' Chiara appreciates why things have gone up, but wants more from the government. 'I feel like I understand why it's going up and some aspects are out of the hands of the government,' she says. 'However, I can't help but feel frustrated that I might need to stop doing some plans or working more in order to balance my money and how I spend it.' To make matters worse, the government has proposed plans to reform higher education - which would mean stopping students accessing loans if they fail English and Maths GSCEs, plus a requirement to pay back student loans when earning less. This is devastating for students, says president of the National Union of Students, Larissa Kennedy. She tells HuffPost UK: 'At a time where the cost of living is soaring and real earnings are crashing, these classist changes could be the difference between heating and eating. The minister is saddling young people with unimaginable debt for the next forty years of their lives. 'Their plans to introduce minimum eligibility requirements are a further attack on opportunity. They gaslight us with the language of 'levelling up' but their proposals are classist, ableist and racist. By seeking to gatekeep education for the most privileged, they are cruelly targeting those from marginalised communities.' Others also feel the same. Three quarters of young people now have a lack of faith in the government and feel like students have been ignored throughout the crisis. In light of soaring inflation rates, young people are now calling on the government to better support them, by providing better access to financial support in line with the cost of living (52%), launching a young person's crisis package (24%), and providing more education on managing finances (17%). This isn't just about nights out and frivolity. It's about protecting the mental health of a generation who've already had a tough two-and-a-half years.  'Mixing with other people is good for our mental health, but most people are now just staying in,' says Sucharitkul. 'People are studying all day and then going home or to work.'", "f177774d9a3bec44b580742e3db359a8978ea9184514a2aec324c7fc": " Just so you know, HuffPost UK may collect a share of sales or other compensation from the links on this page if you decide to shop from them. Oh, and FYI - prices are accurate and items in stock as of time of publication.  With so many festivities packed into the summer months, now is the time to start getting your grill ready for barbecues. If your repertoire usually includes grilled chicken - a popular but notoriously tricky BBQ staple - read on for expert tips on how to prevent chicken from drying out on the grill and how to keep it flavourful, juicy and perfectly charred. Bring the chicken to room temperature before putting it on the grill. One easy way to improve the texture and cooking quality of grilled chicken is to 'let the chicken reach room temperature before it goes on the grill,' said Rodney Scott, founder and pitmaster of Rodney Scott's Whole Hog BBQ in Charleston, South Carolina. Putting cold, straight-out-of-the-fridge chicken on a hot grill will result in a dried-out exterior and underdone interior, so Scott recommends 'taking it out of the fridge about 30 minutes before you start grilling.' Room temperature chicken will grill much more evenly and will better retain its moisture. Keep the grill's temperature at medium to medium-high. It may seem more efficient to crank the grill up to its highest temperature, but when you're cooking grilled chicken, Brian Jupiter, executive chef of The Frontier Chicago and Ina Mae Tavern in Chicago, says 'the best way to keep grilled chicken from drying out is to grill at a medium to medium-high temperature. Oftentimes, grillers are overzealous about how hot the grill needs to be and turn it all the way up. By using a lower temperature, you can still get your grill marks, but with a more consistent cook.' Don't cook your chicken directly over the grill flame. Intense and direct heat won't do your chicken any textural favours. Therefore, it's best both to lower the overall temperature of your grill and to resist the urge to put the chicken right on top of the flames. 'Use a grill that is properly heat soaked (or preheated) and dedicate a section to allow for indirect cooking,' explained grilling expert and cookbook author Paul Sidoriak of Grilling Montana. 'This could mean turning off one of your gas burners or pushing charcoal to one side and cooking the meat adjacent to the flames rather than on top of them. This will allow the chicken to cook much more evenly, and it should retain its moisture. This can also be achieved cooking chicken on the elevated bun rack, which most grills have, but few people use for cooking meat.' Always keep a meat thermometer on hand and make sure to cook the chicken until it reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit for food safety. Brining the chicken beforehand will keep it moist and tender. To lock the moisture inside the chicken throughout the grilling process, 'let your chicken brine before you grill,' said pitmaster and cookbook author Ed Randolph of Handsome Devil in Newburgh, New York. 'The introduction of a brine increases the moisture throughout any cut of chicken, and the saltiness and acidity of the brine make for an extra tender end result.'  You can use either a wet brine (with salt, sugar, and water) or a dry brine (with just salt and herbs), and the chicken should start brining just a few hours before it goes on the grill. Marinate the chicken beforehand and baste it on the grill. If brining is the secret weapon to perfectly textured grilled chicken, then a marinade, which can include oil, vinegar, mustard, barbecue sauce and any number of herbs and seasonings, is the key to standout flavor.  'Don't be afraid to marinate!' suggested Owen McGlynn, the executive chef and owner of Asheville Proper in Asheville, North Carolina. 'I'll use whatever is in the fridge to throw together a quick mustard marinade or chimichurri. Baste the chicken with the marinade through the cooking process to add a little crust.' Consider swapping out chicken breasts for chicken thighs. Chicken breasts may be quick-cooking crowd pleasers, but chicken thighs offer more room for error and ultimately a juicier eating experience.  'Chicken breasts cook extremely quickly and take on a rubbery texture when overcooked,' Jupiter explained. 'Part of the reason for this is because the breast has almost no fat. Chicken thighs have a large quantity of fat and are much more forgiving than chicken breasts. This is because once the fat melts, it lubricates the meat, ultimately keeping it moist. Thighs, compared to breasts, can also stand up to much higher heats and pair perfectly with a slight char.' Consider grilling a spatchcocked whole chicken. If you're willing to take on a small project, then spatchcocking a whole chicken (removing the backbone and pressing it flat) can make for an excellent cookout entree.  'Start with a great product,' advised chef Samuel Kim of Baekjeong Korean Barbecue in California. 'Look for an organic, 3- to 4-pound roaster. Buy the whole bird; the bones and the skin will protect the meat while grilling. They also add tremendous flavour. Brine the chicken to prevent it from drying out during grilling, then spatchcock the chicken so when it's on the grill, the legs/thighs cook at the same rate as the breast.' Kim lets the brined chicken rest in the fridge for up to 48 hours before putting it on a medium-high grill skin-side down, and grilling until the internal temperature reaches 165degF (73degC)", "3781989d068e339536ce63a8c6bdb25fbe4055229e42f808d732da1e": "We hope you love the products we recommend!

Sir Bob Neill, also a select committee chair, said he has submitted a letter of no confidence in Johnson, arguing a 'change in leadership is required' to restore trust in politics. He said: 'Trust is the most important commodity in politics, but these events have undermined trust in not just the office of the prime minister, but in the political process itself.' Prior to Neill's announcement, four MPs called for Johnson to go since Sue Gray's damning report was published on Wednesday. Several other Tory MPs had previously demanded the PM step down. It takes 54 MPs to submit letters Sir Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 committee of backbench Conservatives, to trigger a no confidence vote in Johnson, which would force a leadership contest. Alicia Kearns, a Conservative elected to the Commons in 2019 during Johnson's landslide election victory, also reaffirmed that her leader had lost her confidence.  Also on Friday, Tory MP Paul Holmes quit his government job over the 'deep mistrust' voters now have in the Conservative Party.  Neill, who chairs the Commons justice committee, said he had waited to read the senior civil servant's full report into No 10 lockdown parties before making up his mind but said he found the prime minister's explanations for his behaviour lacked credibility. Posting a statement on his website, the MP for Bromley and Chislehurst said: 'I have listened carefully to the explanations the prime minister has given, in parliament and elsewhere, and, regrettably, do not find his assertions to be credible. 'That is why, with a heavy heart, I submitted a letter of no confidence to Sir Graham Brady on Wednesday afternoon. 'Trust is the most important commodity in politics, but these events have undermined trust in not just the office of the prime minister, but in the political process itself. 'To rebuild that trust and move on, a change in leadership is required.' Meanwhile, Kearns said the prime minister's 'account of events to parliament' about No 10 lockdown parties was 'misleading'. The Rutland and Melton MP said in a Facebook post: 'It is wrong that families were banned from saying goodbye to their dying loved ones, whilst the prime minister was complicit in the holding of many goodbye parties for his staff, which we now know displayed a complete disregard for restrictions and were complete with vomiting, fighting and bullying. 'I can only conclude that the prime minister's account of events to parliament was misleading. 'If he did not know about the culture of parties, then this is because he failed to ask the questions necessary, or has chosen not to since last October. 'Those around him clearly did not advise a policy of being honest and transparent with the British people.' Kearns added: 'My position remains unchanged since January, and the prime minister continues not to hold my confidence.'  Sue Gray's partygate report painted a debauched picture of booze-fuelled lockdown partying into the early hours, cleaners having to scrub red wine off the walls, a fight between staff, and a karaoke machine at the ready.

'With the benefit of hindsight, where I'm sitting now, of course it was not the right decision, it was the wrong decision, there was no excuse for that,' DPS director and colonel Steven McCraw told reporters.  The admission comes days after 19 children and two teachers were gunned down at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, on Tuesday. At least 19 police officers waited outside of the classroom door where the suspect was shooting because a commanding officer on scene believed it was a 'barricaded subject' and not an active shooter. That officer was wrong. 'I wasn't there, but I'm telling you from what we know,' McCraw told reporters. 'When there's an active shooter, the rules change, it's no longer a barricaded subject, you don't have time.' More than 40 minutes passed from the time the shooter, 18-year-old Salvador Ramos, entered the school to when he was eventually killed. During that time, children placed calls to 911 begging for help as operators could hear gunshots being fired in the background, McCraw said. But police stood by, because an unnamed commanding officer believed the gunman had barricaded himself and wanted to wait for a tactical team instead of engaging with the gunman. 'I wasn't there,' McCraw repeated at the press conference, 'but a decision was made that this was a barricaded subject, and that there was time to retrieve the keys and wait for a tactical team with equipment to breach the doors.' 'That was the thought process at that particular time,' McCraw added. In one of the 911 calls that took place just after noon, a girl said 12 people in her classroom were dead but that eight to nine students were still alive. Minutes later, at 12:21 pm, an operator could hear three shots fired in the background. Police outside the room still didn't act, according to the new timeline provided by McCraw. Police were eventually able to get keys from the school janitor to enter the classrooms, where they finally killed the gunman.", "35008a179ebee7bc297c329d4c203959e59035eeddb3278554debf73": "Will Young has opened up about his choice to step down from Strictly Come Dancing in 2016, revealing he considers it to be 'the best decision' he's ever made. During an interview with The Telegraph, the Jealousy singer was asked what he considers to be his best decision, with Will naming his Strictly departure. Explaining his reasoning, Will said: 'Because I chose my wellbeing over work.' 'It was a very good lesson for me,' he recalled. 'Looking back, it was a brave decision, and the right one. 'I was very ill. I had bad hypervigilance [a symptom of PTSD described by Mind as 'extreme alertness'] and a bad nervous system, and I needed to look after myself.'

I was dragging myself to rehearsals. I just couldn't do it any more. 'It was so bad I thought - I'm not joking - I thought about breaking my leg. 'I decided to take on Strictly because I bloody love dancing. And I bloody hated it, because I was so ill.' He previously dismissed claims that a disagreement with then-judge Len Goodman had caused him to quit the show, insisting: 'It was important for me to leave Strictly for my own wellbeing. It was a number of things. It was nothing to do with the people on the show, and it certainly wasn't because Len Goodman dissed my Salsa - I mean, come on!'

The Rachel Green actor was the very first guest on the long-running chat show almost two decades ago, so it seemed fitting that she also appear as the interviewee during Ellen's last instalment when it aired in the US this week. Over the course of the conversation, the host asked Jen for some advice on how she 'dealt with' the end of her own long-running TV series back in 2004. 'The ending of Friends? Well, I got a divorce, and went into therapy,' Jen quipped. 'Oh, and then I did a movie called The Break-Up.' She added: 'I just kind of leaned into the end. I was like, 'you know what guys? Let's make this a completely new chapter'.' Jen was, of course, referring to her divorce from ex-husband Brad Pitt. The two were married for seven years before they announced their split in January 2005, seven months after the Friends finale aired in the US. Brad went on to get together with Angelina Jolie, his co-star in the film Mr And Mrs Smith, before their eventual break-up in 2016.

Earlier this month, the Mysterious Girl singer was mentioned during Rebekah's infamous 'WAGatha Christie' libel battle against Coleen Rooney, after she gave an interview in 2004 about a purported sexual encounter with him. The article carried the headline 'Peter's hung like a small chipolata, shaved, slobbery, lasts five minutes,' with Rebekah admitting she was 'forced into a situation by my ex-husband' to do the interview.

'It is more about the fact that something is brought up again and again and again and again. At some point you kind of go... 'And that is the only thing, it becomes more than just that. We all say stupid things. Everyone does. I am sure I have said many stupid things in my life.' However, the Mysterious Girl singer did joke: 'Are you asking me to address the elephant in the room? Did I say elephant?' Last week, Peter spoke out about being mentioned in court in a video posted on his social media channels. 'Sorry to Emily [his wife] and the children that have had to see and hear some not very nice things,' he wrote in the caption, before going on to say in the video: 'Seeing as I haven't had much of a say in this, and just let everyone have a laugh and whatever, whatever, I'm just going to put it out.

After five years of blood, sweat and tears (probably), the ABBA Voyage live experience finally launched this week. More than 40 years since ABBA last shared a stage, they were back (kinda) to entertain their loyal fans at the purpose-built ABBA Arena in London. Three thousand fans and VIPs - including the actual king and queen of Sweden - were in the audience to watch what HuffPost described as a 'jaw-dropping' show. With groundbreaking technology at the show's heart, it took a team of thousands to create. Here, we take a look at how the fantasy became a (virtual) reality... Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), founded by George Lucas of Star Wars fame, created the digital versions of ABBA, known as ABBAtars 'They got on a stage in front of 160 cameras and almost as many genius [digital] artists, and performed every song in this show to perfection, capturing every mannerism, every emotion, the soul of their beings -- so that becomes the great magic of this endeavour,' explains producer Ludvig Andersson. 'It is not four people pretending to be ABBA: It is actually them,'  It took 1000 artists working in four global studios to bring the ABBAtars to life 'Their enthusiasm, professionalism and love for their craft has not only been very infectious but also paramount for the whole endeavour,' Ludvig says.  ABBA are officially more important than Batman 'It took a while to convince ILR to do it because we're basically taking over the whole company,' Ludvig reveals.  'They had Batman going 'hello, we have Batman and we need you'. It was a big decision for ILM to take us on.' 160 cameras were used to film ABBA's motion capture performance technique over a five week period  'For a whole month we got into our 'space suits' and helmets to perform our songs,' Agnetha recalls. 'It got a little hot under the lights and spots, but there was nothing for it but to carry on. Sometimes all four of us wondered what it was we'd got ourselves into.' The sight of each other in their 'strange' motion capture outfits had the whole group cracking up 'It's no exaggeration to say that it took a few days to get used to it, both seeing yourself in the mirror and the others in these strange outfits,' Frida says.  Agnetha adds: 'We had many wonderful laughs looking at each other.' Each day of filming was themed by a different ABBA song 'Every day had a working title, which was the title of one of our songs,' Frida recalls. 'Images were hung on the walls of our backstage room to illustrate the day's theme. It all helped create a great working environment and sense of community.' ...And that meant the crew really embraced the themes too 'On Eurovision Day, all the crew was dressed like Napoleon and carrying the Swedish flag,' Producer Ludvig remembers. ABBA's signature moves are present and correct... but they've cleverly been brought bang up to date World-renowned and award-winning choreographer, Wayne McGregor has been working with ABBA since 2020 to bring movement and life to the ABBAtars, innovating with their signature dance style.  The stunning costumes are all real designs, which have been digitised There are five costume changes during the show, with design created by Dolce & Gabbana, Manish Arora, Erevos Aether and Michael Schmidt. There is a 10-piece live band accompanying the ABBAtars on stage 'The fact that every note you hear is being played live, in the moment, is one of the fundamentals of the whole project,' says producer Ludvig. It is LOUD There are 291 speakers inside the ABBA Arena, creating 870,000 watts of audio amplification, which means nothing to us but it sounds very, very impressive. There are also a LOT of lights 30,000 individually controlled lighting points and 500 moving lights to be precise. That's going to be one hefty electricity bill.  The lighting plays a major role in the show 'It's one of the three creative pillars that sublimates the ABBA avatars by weaving a link between two worlds: the real room and the virtual stage,' explains lighting producer Matthew Debay. 'Creating a bridge between the world of cinema and the world of entertainment. That was our challenge.' The show features 20 songs... but it took a long time to narrow them down 'I think Benny and Bjorn did about 18 versions of the setlist,' producer Ludvig reveals. Director Baillie Walsh was already a huge ABBA fan 'I'm not just a fan of ABBA, they're in my DNA,' he revealed. 'They're part of who I am. I saw them win Eurovision and they've been in my life ever since.' Choreographer Wayne McGregor has also always been a massive fan of the group  'I grew up listening to ABBA in Stockport. I learnt Ballroom, Latin American and Disco dance to ABBA tracks,' Wayne recalls. HuffPost UK were at the opening night of the show. Read our review of ABBA Voyage here.

There are different codes for the government in Westminster, and in each of the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. All four of them set out the 'overarching duty' of ministers to follow the law and the ethical standards called the Seven Principles of Public Life - these include openness, integrity, honesty and accountability. The ministerial code also sets out how collective responsibility - the idea all ministers are responsible for government as a whole - works, although the centralised UK one is particularly flexible. Prior to the new policy statement No.10 released on Friday, the code said ministers 'will be expected to offer their resignation to the prime minister' if they 'knowingly mislead parliament'. No other sanctions for breaching the code are laid out. What's the main change? Now, ministers who are found to have breached the code in a 'minor' way will no longer be automatically expected to resign or face the sack. The government's policy statement said it would be 'disproportionate' for this to happen for 'any breach, however minor'. Instead the prime minister could order 'some form of public apology, remedial action or remove of ministerial salary for a period' as punishment instead. The statement explains: 'Reflecting the prime minister's accountability for the conduct of the executive, it is important that a role is retained for the prime minister is decisions about investigations.' One of the reasons behind the change is allegedly to avoid 'incentives for trivial or vexatious complaints, which may be made for partisan reasons'. It comes after complaints from Labour and the Lib Dems about ministers' behaviour. Who investigates potential breaches? Lord Christopher Geidt, a former aide to the Queen, has been the independent adviser investigating potential breaches ever since Johnson appointed him April 2021. However, it is still down to the prime minister to decide if an investigation should even take place, and how - Johnson has rejected the idea that the adviser could be able to launch an investigation without his say-so in these new changes. Johnson will also still have the power to block an inquiry, although an adviser has the power to make this situation public. Geidt also does not have to publish his findings, but can 'require' that the government publishes them 'in a timely manner'. It's worth noting that there is no explicit process laid out in the code explaining how to make sure officials follow it. What else has changed? Johnson has also rewritten the foreword to the code. He removed any wording related to honesty, integrity, transparency and accountability. His 2019 foreword, said: 'The precious principles of public life enshrined in this document - integrity, objectivity, accountability, transparency, honesty and leadership in the public interest - must be honoured at all times; as must the political impartiality of our much admired civil service.' Now, it reads: 'Thirty years after it was first published, the ministerial code continues to fulfil its purpose, guiding my ministers on how they should act and arrange their affairs. As the leader of Her Majesty's government, my accountability is to parliament and, via the ballot box, to the British people.' Why does any of this matter? This is very unusual as codes are usually only updated at the start of each administration. The timing, too, is alarming - the prime minister himself is currently facing an investigation to see if he 'knowingly' broke the code by misleading parliament through the partygate saga. The ministerial code holds the government to account and maintains standards in public office. It has been in place, in some form, since World War 2.  As Labour MP and chair of the privileges committee, Chris Bryant tweeted: 'The new ministerial code is a disgrace. It means that the tiny semblance of accountability disappears. 'If you break the rules just rewrite the rule book is the motto of this despicable government.' What does this mean for Johnson? Johnson is facing an investigation by the Commons Privileges Committee to see if he misled the Commons, when he repeatedly claimed that no rules had been broken - to the best of his knowledge - in Downing Street during lockdown. Now, if the prime minister is found to have breached the code, then the rule change means there would be less pressure for him to resign. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said that the change made it clear Johnson was 'downgrading standards and debasing the principles of public life before our very eyes'. The Lib Dem's chief whip, Wendy Chamberlain, also said it was an 'appalling attempt' to 'rig the rules to get himself off the hook'. Chamberlain added: 'The prime minister shouldn't be allowed to decide on his own punishment with zero accountability. 'This is making him judge and jury in his own case. If the privileges committee finds Boris Johnson lied to parliament, surely Conservative MPs will have no choice but to sack him.' Since the Sue Gray probe into partygate was published this week, only a handful of Tory MPs have called for Johnson to step down.", "24c56aeea8b2f1a6a04d74f2b4f5d874fd56d263f0c35f2edbbd6ffe": "Activist group Led By Donkeys has done it again and struck at the heart of government over partygate with its latest stunt. On the day the highly-anticipated Sue Gray report was published - after the Met issued 126 fines to 83 people who attended illegal Downing Street parties during lockdown - the campaigners projected a damning video onto the side of the Parliament building. The activists are famous for holding the government to account, and this latest antic is no different. The clip begins by calling itself the 'Partygate crime file' followed by footage from the prime minister dating back to the start on the pandemic, when he told the public: 'If you don't follow the rules, the police will have the power to enforce them.' A voiceover from writer Gavin Esler then begins: ''Boris Johnson and the MPs who work in this building passed laws which banned us from attending social gatherings. ''We weren't even allowed to visit sick relatives, so they died alone in the tens of thousands. 'The British people stuck to the rules because the politicians who work in this building told them to.' The video then cuts to a clip of home secretary Priti Patel telling the press: 'If there was a big party taking place, it would be right to call the police.' Although Johnson and his staff attended several of these gatherings, Led By Donkeys claims: 'Most Conservative MPs don't care, they say it's all overblown and we need to move on.' It then flashes to clips of culture secretary Nadine Dorries calling partygate a 'misnomer' and Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg dubbing the interest in the parties 'fluff'. The clip then moves through all of the parties which were investigated, including the bring your own booze event in May 2020 and parties in June 2020. The video also compares the punishment the government has received for its parties with the way the general public were penalised for socialising at exactly the same time. The activists also remind viewers of the Downing Street Christmas party held in December 2020 where red wine was sprayed on the walls, alone with the later parties to mark the departure of two No.10 staffers in January. At the time, the government was urgently telling the public to avoid socialising where at all possible to slow down Covid transmission. The video also mentions the two parties on the eve of Prince Philip's funeral, including the one where a suitcase of wine was wheeled into No.10.  It concludes by noting that at least four of the parties the Johnson attended were illegal, according to the recently-concluded investigation from the Met. The voiceover ends: 'The address that has received the most lockdown fines, the place that is the most criminally sanctioned property in Britain, is 10 Downing Street. 'But for hundreds of MPs who made the rules in this building, and told the rest of us to follow them, loyalty to Boris Johnson is more important than respect for the truth and for the law itself.' Only a few MPs in the Conservative Party have publicly called for Johnson to resign since the Sue Gray report was released, although one Tory MP left his government role over the 'toxic' party culture in No.10 on Friday.", "ca2d5483464c28a41920ed773ab009a54b07923d038793703608fd0e": "  We hope you love the products we recommend!

Paul Holmes, the MP for Eastleigh, was a ministerial aide to home secretary Priti Patel. In a statement on his website on Friday following the publication of the Sue Gray report earlier this week, Holmes said it was 'distressing' that his work as a constituency MP had been 'tarnished by the toxic culture' in No.10. Holmes did not call on Boris Johnson to resign, but told voters: 'I, like most of you, was shocked and angered by the revelations when so many people across Eastleigh followed the rules and sacrificed many things in the need to stop the spread of the virus. 'Revelations from the Sue Gray report that staff and cleaners were not treated properly is both disappointing and unacceptable. 'It is right that the prime minister apologised to staff. It clearly showed a culture in No. 10 that was distasteful. 'It is clear to me that a deep mistrust in both the government and the Conservative Party has been created by these events, something that pains me personally as someone who always tries to represent Eastleigh and its people with integrity.' He added: 'That is why I have now resigned from my governmental responsibilities as a parliamentary private secretary at the Home Office.' Since Gray's report was published on Wednesday, four MPs have called for Johnson to resign. Several others had previously already demanded he step down. It takes 54 Tory MPs to trigger a no confidence vote in Johnson. Speaking in Stockton-on-Tees today, Johnson said he was confident he had enough backing to survive and had already given 'exhaustive answers' on partygate. 'What I also said was what we want to do is focus on driving jobs, driving investment in this country,' he said. 'What we're doing today is we're talking about getting people off welfare and into work, and we can see that.'", "43f6ed88f0d6cd2e92931f3d5763432a6153e0f3fc7d4fcbdae61082": "Dame Joan Collins has claimed she has some inside information about Madonna's approach to dating, as told to her by the singer's son Rocco. On Thursday night, the Dynasty star made an appearance on Piers Morgan Uncensored, during which the host asked her about reports in the tabloid press that Madonna is 'auditioning' new younger boyfriends, following her rumoured split from Ahlamalik Williams earlier in the year. 'You're kidding! No you've just made that up!' she responded, with Piers insisting he'd read in the media Madonna was looking for someone 'hard-bodied and young'. 'Oh, that's right,' Dame Joan then teased, before sharing an anecdote about a conversation with the Queen of Pop's 21-year-old son. She explained: 'We were with her son, Rocco, last summer and he said, 'You know my mother says that she will not sleep with anybody over the age of 25!'. I said, 'No Rocco, you're kidding!'.' Piers then interjected with a joke about Dame Joan's own romantic life, commenting: 'That's never been your rule, has it?' 'I don't have rules!' she insisted. '[I've been] very happily married [for] 20 years!' Dame Joan - whose own husband Percy is around 30 years her junior - previously praised Madonna for her relationships with younger men, tweeting: 'So @Madonna reported to be with guys three decades younger than her... #copycat #yougogirl!!'  Since Madonna's split from Rocco's dad, film director Guy Ritchie, she has been in relationships with Brazilian model Jesus Luz, her former back-up dancer Brahim Zaibat and choreographer Timor Steffens.

You need that boomerang shot of the mimosa for the Insta (duh). Many of us are prone to sharing everyday snippets (read: highlights) of our lives on social media, showing a curated audience our quirks, realities, and individualities. Some even share more intimate details.  But while some of us are snapping away hands to take that foodie pic, or rapidly firing away a Tweet to share something that happened, others are quietly watching on. These people - who are no better or worse than their counterparts - may or may not be on social media, but they certainly choose to be less active. So, what separates us? Are there inherent qualities that make some of us more prone to sharing online than others?  The obvious indicator of posting likelihood is age, says Dr Melissa Brown, associate professor of communications at Santa Clara University. She tells HuffPost UK: 'The main sociological explanation, among internet users is age cohort. People whose adolescence and young adulthood are defined by access to internet-enabled technologies essentially grow up online.Their main source of media consumption and communication has transpired on the internet for the better part of the twenty-first century. 'Therefore, norms about appropriate sharing in public spaces are determined by the fact that for many people of the social media generation, public happens online.' But not all young people are content-driven socialites. And consider how siblings, who are roughly around the same age and had the same upbringing - in a predominantly digital world - may vary significantly in their online attitudes.  Saba, a nursery teacher from London, says she and her siblings are completely different. 'I'm the only one out of my siblings who is really active on social media,' she says. 'One of my brothers isn't on social media, the other hardly uses his socials, and my sister posts once in a while, [usually] a picture of her plants. 'I, on the other hand, post Reels, Stories, carousels based on experiences, reviews and to support small businesses.' Differences like this among siblings could come down to character traits, says Louise Tyler, a BACP accredited counsellor. Whether you're more introverted or extroverted plays a part.  'Just because people are siblings, doesn't mean they will necessary have the same personality,' she tells HuffPost UK. 'Although environmental plays some part, various studies have found that in fact personality is strongly determined by genetics. Because there is not just one parent involved, genetic inheritance can differ hugely between siblings. There's room for massive personality differences. 'If we look at the five main personality traits - agreeableness, conscientiousness, extroversion, neuroticism, and openness - of which we are all on a spectrum from high to low, where a sibling sits on the spectrum will play a big part in how likely they are to use social media in a very personal way.' But ultimately - extroverted or introverted - individuals may cultivate their own social media habits, including oversharing, because it's about what makes them comfortable. If you're a chatty Cathy IRL, you may be more inclined to digital chatter, too.  Dr Brown adds: 'I think we could all be guilty of oversharing depending on whether or not an internet platform has features that encourages the styles of communication each individual is already comfortable with in offline contexts.'", "67d88fa064b7a104ac38d05b920f674304d172e762affd7775ecf54e": "Nadine Dorries has once again tried to impress social media, this time by making going one step further and making an unusual rap about her Online Safety Bill. The culture secretary and loyal ally to Boris Johnson has regularly caused a stir ever since she was appointed to cabinet in September. Aside from accidentally saying you can 'downstream' movies, forgetting how Channel 4 is actually funded and getting confused about Microsoft's algorithms, Dorries has made a name for herself for controversially trying to reconstruct the digital landscape. This includes calling for the BBC to be more neutral and privatising Channel 4. Now she is championing the Online Safety Bill to protect users - and is trying to make it appeal to younger audiences through her new TikTok rap. The lyrics - cut through with interesting angles of the culture secretary herself and some famous memes - read as follows: 'The UK is passing some new legislation/ 'To make the internet safer for the younger generation. 'It's effectively a framework to protect internet users/ 'From scams, illegal content and anonymous abusers.  'It will force big tech to stop their terms being breaches/ 'And puts in measures to defend free speech. ''But is it true it will impact freedom of expression? 'No, we put in legal protections in the 19th section. 'Another thing we're doing through the laws we're passing/  'Is tackling online crime and cyberflashing.  'If companies fail to comply with the law/ 'and fail to protect the users that they're responsible for, ''The regulator Ofcom will have the power to fine/ 'So platforms must keep people safe online.' At the end, she literally drops the mic. The rap was so surprising that even Sooz Kempner, who regularly mocks Dorries on her social media accounts through impersonations, refused to share her own interpretation of the culture secretary. In response to the video, she tweeted: 'I ain't touching this. No way.'  She later added: 'I'm not gonna do it. It's just a shit TikTok that nobody needs a shit parody of. She's bound to say or do something that harms the industry I work in that she's in charge of soon and then I'll sadly run a brush through the wig.' And here's what everyone else has been saying about the TikTok... The TikTok was also making the rounds on the day the BBC announced it was cutting several of its channels, including BBC Four and CBBC. The BBC's funding has been cut because Dorries has frozen the broadcaster's licence fee for two years - prompting only more criticism in the culture secretary's direction.", "2a483ff3f74dd4172de76d7e9f830b4b18b941eb70c2ed05f215fa3e": "Almost 60% of voters in the red wall want to see the minimum wage raised to PS15 an hour, amid a worsening cost of living crisis, a new poll has revealed. The survey by Survation showed 57% of voters in seats which switched from Labour to Conservative at the 2019 election in the midlands and the north back the move, while only 23% are opposed. The poll, conducted for the Autonomy think-tank and shared with HuffPost UK, also showed 42% of Tory voters in the seats support the rise, with 37% opposed. And of people who voted Leave, 48% wanted to see the minimum wage rise to PS15, with only 29% opposed. The national living wage, for people aged 23 and over, rose to PS9.50 in April.  But Will Stronge, the director of research at Autonomy, said a PS10 an hour minimum wage was 'beginning to look totally insufficient'. 'If the government wants to be seen as serious about levelling up Britain and tackling the cost of living then a higher minimum wage is an obvious starting point,' he said. ''PS15 an hour is a fair and decent wage which would instantly boost living standards for many workers across the country.' It comes after Rishi Sunak unveiled a PS21bn package of measures, including a PS400 discount on energy bills for every household, to try and help people with soaring prices.

The contest was triggered after Conservative MP Imran Ahmad Khan was convicted for sexually assaulting a boy.   The Tories won the seat 3,358 in 2019, it had been held by Labour since 1932.  Winning back a parliamentary seat in the red wall would be a huge boost for Keir Starmer ahead of the next election. Labour members backed a PS15 minimum wage at the party's annual conference in 2021. But Starmer and the party leadership has so far only committed to a PS10 minimum wage, and he was hit by a shadow cabinet resignation after he opposed a motion backing a hike to PS15.

As the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Kyle attacked the prime minister over his handling of partygate, the economy and the Northern Ireland protocol in a one and a half minute speech. Kyle said: 'The first and only duty of a leader is to make sure the culture overall is right and the culture is delivering the outcomes that it needs to be doing so. 'Boris Johnson failed on that.' He alleged the publication of the Sue Gray report - the internal probe into the Downing Street parties which took place during lockdown - proves Johnson 'lies, he is reckless and he's incompetent'. The civil servant did blame 'senior leadership' at the top of the government for the serial breach of Covid rules and Johnson said he took full responsibility for everything that happened - despite allegedly not being aware of how out of hand these parties became during a deadly pandemic. Kyle continued: 'The reason why this is so important is if we now look at how our country is run, the fact that our international reputation is being shredded, the fact that the protocol is not delivering and the negotiations aren't being sorted out.' The Northern Ireland Protocol, which the prime minister negotiated back in 2019, has caused a stalemate in Stormont this month. Unionists are refusing to sit in the devolved government until Johnson intervenes to stop the country feeling so separate from the rest of the UK. Kyle then pointed out: 'There's almost seven million people waiting for treatment in the NHS, no more so than here in Northern Ireland. 'We have 56,000 people who are victims of serious crime who are waiting for their day in court [and] we have an economy with low growth, high tax, high interest rates.' He claimed this is all because of the person running the country.  'That's why what we see in the Sue Gray report, what we know now for a fact, about the behaviour and the way the leader of our country works, is actually having a massive impact,' Kyle explained. 'Not just on the culture in No.10 but in the way our country is being run and perceived as a country around the world. 'Our country deserves better and we will not get better until Boris Johnson is gone.' His words came at a time where Johnson's time in No.10 is once again looking unstable, with various Tory MPs coming forward to call for his resignation. The clip also emerged hours after former Tory leadership contender Rory Stewart shredded the prime minister and his government on ITV's Good Morning Britain. Addressing the Treasury's new measures aimed at reducing the cost of living crisis (announced the day after the Gray report was published), Stewart suggested Downing Street was struggling. 'They won't make basic decisions,' he claimed. 'They won't cut VAT on fuel, which is basic to save people's lives. 'And the reason they won't make these decisions is because they're fighting, day by day, these headlines. 'The whole of Downing Street is about one thing, which is the survival of the prime minister. 'They are sacrificing everything, the country, the party, their careers, to try to keep this monstrous ego floating around in No.10.'

Milne's earliest Winnie The Pooh stories entered the public domain earlier this year. Now, inevitably, some of Milne's most beloved characters are going to partake in a whole lot of murder. Jagged Edge Productions, a U.K.-based indie film studio, recently released stills from its upcoming slasher movie Winnie The Pooh: Blood And Honey on Instagram. By the looks of things, the tale will effectively turn the Hundred Acre Woods into the Hundred Acre 'Cabin in the Woods.' 'I wanted to make something original. A lot of horror concepts/villains are the same, werewolves, ghosts, vampires, zombies,' director Rhys Waterfield, who also wrote and co-produced the film, told HuffPost in an email. 'This really excited me because it was so different. I was primarily inspired by Wrong Turn for the film, but the two villains are a bit more intelligent in this.' Waterfield offered HuffPost a synopsis of his film. 'Pooh and Piglet experienced a drastic drop in food as Christopher [Robin] grew up, so over the years [they] became increasingly hungry and feral. Eventually they had to eat Eeyore to survive,' the description from Waterfield reads. 'Christopher returns and discovered his old feral friends are no longer what they seem. Upon seeing Christopher, Pooh and Piglet go on a rampage and eventually target a rural cabin, where a group of girls from university are staying.' The film wrapped shooting earlier this month, but Waterfield explained that due to the excitement the stills have generated online, they are expediting the post-production process and hope to release the movie in a month or two. 'We are working through post-production, so no official trailer yet,' he told HuffPost. 'We had hoped to wait a bit to release everything.' While the images in the stills are terrifying, it is -- at the very least -- a comfort to see Pooh fully clothed and finally embracing the concept of pants. Actually, Waterfield told Variety there's a reason for that. Milne's earliest stories are now out of copyright, but Disney still retains exclusive use of its own interpretations of Pooh Bear and his friends. 'We've tried to be extremely careful,' Waterfield told the outlet. 'We knew there was this line between that, and we knew what their copyright was and what they've done. So we did as much as we could to make sure [the film] was only based on the 1926 version of it.' It's why certain beloved characters, like Tigger, won't be featured in the slasher film. Variety reports that there will be a scene featuring Eeyore's tombstone, but -- sorry, hardcore horror fans -- his gruesome murder won't be detailed in the movie, either.", "beb771fc288631ccd2fc8f8b3b70a29a4dd8daa08e68fbc90e884f21": "Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese and have led tributes to Goodfellas star Ray Liotta, following his death at the age of 67. On Thursday, Deadline reported that the US star had died in his sleep while in the Dominican Republic, where he had been working on the upcoming film Dangerous Waters. His death was later confirmed by his representatives to the PA news agency. Liotta is best known for his portrayal of Henry Hill in Goodfellas opposite De Niro and Joe Pesci. Scorsese, who directed Liotta in the 1990 film, praised the 'uniquely gifted' and 'courageous' performer, adding he would 'always be proud' of the work they had done together. 'I'm absolutely shocked and devastated by the sudden, unexpected death of Ray Liotta,' Scorsese said in a statement.   'He was so uniquely gifted, so adventurous, so courageous as an actor. 'Playing Henry Hill in Goodfellas was a tall order, because the character had so many different facets, so many complicated layers, and Ray was in almost every scene of a long, tough shoot.   'He absolutely amazed me, and I'll always be proud of the work we did together on that picture. 'My heart goes out to his loved ones, and it aches for his loss, way too early.' De Niro also issued a statement, saying: 'I was very saddened to learn of Ray's passing. He is way too young to have left us.' Lorraine Bracco, who played Karen Friedman Hill in Goodfellas, said she was 'shattered' to hear the 'terrible news' about her former co-star.   Sharing a photo of them on Twitter, she added: 'I can be anywhere in the world and people will come up and tell me their favorite movie is Goodfellas. 'Then they always ask what was the best part of making that movie. My response has always been the same... Ray Liotta.' Before Goodfellas, Liotta found fame playing ex-con Ray Sinclair in 1986 black comedy Something Wild, for which he received a Golden Globe nomination, He went on to star as Shoeless Joe Jackson in the 1989 film Field Of Dreams and then the gangster epic. His Field Of Dreams co-star Kevin Costner recalled his 'god-given' baseball scene in the film in his own tribute to Liotta.  Costner starred as farmer Ray Kinsella in the 1989 film, which was nominated for three Oscars. Sharing a video clip of the classic scene to Instagram, Costner wrote: 'Devastated to hear the news of Ray Liotta's passing. While he leaves an incredible legacy, he'll always be 'Shoeless Joe Jackson' in my heart. 'What happened that moment in the film was real. God gave us that stunt. Now God has Ray.' Jennifer Lopez also said that she felt 'lucky' to have worked and learnt from Liotta on the crime drama TV series Shades Of Blue, in which they starred from 2016 to 2018. The pop superstar and actor paid tribute by sharing a series of photos on Instagram of them together along with a clip of the pair acting out an emotional scene during the show. Tributes to Liotta also came from famous faces including Ed Sheeran, Taron Egerton and Seth Rogen.  In more recent years, the actor had been enjoying something of a resurgence in his acting career, appearing in the Sopranos sequel The Many Saints Of Newark as twins Aldo and Salvatore Molisanti, the period drama No Sudden Move and the Oscar-winning Netflix film Marriage Story.   He had also recently completed filming on the Apple TV+ miniseries Black Bird, which co-stars Taron Egerton and Greg Kinnear, and the Elizabeth Banks horror film Cocaine Bear.   He is survived by his daughter, Karsen, whose mother is the actor and film producer Michelle Grace.

The California-based Duchess of Sussex donated food at a community center that was hosting a blood drive, and laid flowers at a memorial for the shooting victims, according to BuzzFeed News. Blood drive volunteers told the news site that Markle quietly visited the center's kitchen to drop off two large crates filled with sandwiches, drinks and desserts for blood donors.  'I had no idea who she was. She just was carrying on a conversation like her and I knew each other for years,' volunteer Gloria Contreras told BuzzFeed. 'We were just talking about, you know, the situation and what happened what we were doing here.' A representative for Markle confirmed to several news outlets that the duchess visited Uvalde in a 'personal capacity as a mother' to offer her condolences to the community. 'She was just really sweet,' another volunteer, Georjean Burnell, told BuzzFeed News. 'She just kind of walked in with her crew and started putting ice waters in the bucket with us and laying out chips for the people who were needing snacks before and after donating.' 'It's funny, we didn't even know it was her until after she left and now we're so sad,' Burnell added. 'I mean, to be honest, we thought she was our neighbour.' A number of people remain hospitalised after the shooting. Uvalde Memorial Hospital received 17 children, two of whom were dead on arrival, a hospital executive told reporters earlier this week. Several patients were also transported to University Hospital in San Antonio, which is roughly 80 miles from Uvalde.

The chancellor announced yesterday every household in Britain will be given a PS400 rebate off their gas and electricity bill this winter to ease the cost of living crisis.  However, it means even the wealthiest in society will receive discounts when they do not necessarily need one. Those who own second homes will also receive the PS400 energy bill discount for each one. When that argument was put to him this morning, the chancellor said he would donate any money he receives through the cost of living schemes to charity. He admitted on Sky News that he and presenter Niall Paterson did not need the extra help but that it was the easiest way to help tens of millions of people.  'The reality is when you're talking about that number of people, there really aren't many ways to do it and we wanted to make sure that this was as universal as possible,' he said. The chancellor said they looked at a council tax rebate but sometimes those in larger houses still needed help.  'So actually, this being universal means that we avoid all of those problems and really do get help to everyone who needs it,' he added. 'And you, I'm sure like me, you can also give that money to charity. If you don't need it.' Paterson replied: 'That's great, but it strikes me that rich people didn't get rich by handing back free money that they received from the government. 'It's good for you that you're going to donate it to charity I'll wager most people who receive it won't.' Sunak replied: 'I think it's incumbent on someone to say 'well, here's the alternative' - how else would you get the support to those on middle incomes who are working hard who do feel they need support? 'And I hear a lot from them every week, just because they're not on benefits or they're not pensioners. They still actually think this is tough for me it's a PS1,200 increase in my energy bill. 'It's right that the government's on my side and I do want to be on the side of those people.'  It comes just a week after Sunak became the first frontline politician to be named in The Sunday Times Rich List since its inception in 1989. He and his wife Akshata Murthy entered the list for the first time with their joint PS730 million fortune. The timing could not have been worse for the politician as inflation hit a 40-year high, prompting further fears about the UK tipping into a recession.  In another interview on Friday morning, the chancellor insisted second homes receiving another PS400 energy bill grant would only account for a small proportion of payments. He told BBC Breakfast: 'Second homes account for one or two per cent of the property stock.' Every household in Britain will receive a PS400 rebate off their gas and electricity bill this winter as part of a PS21 billion package to deal with the cost-of-living crisis. The scheme will be funded by increased borrowing and the imposition of a PS5 billion windfall tax on oil and gas companies - in a significant U-turn by the chancellor.  However, some have pointed out the 'cynical' timing of the government's package after Tory ministers spent weeks dismissing the need for such a levy. Cabinet ministers had been openly skeptical about the policy and not a single Conservative MP voted in favour of the proposal when Labour put it to a vote last week. The plan was also unveiled a day after the publication of Sue Gray's partygate report, which painted a damning picture of booze-fuelled lockdown partying into the early hours, cleaners having to scrub red wine off the walls, a fight between staff, and a karaoke machine at the ready. However, the chancellor insisted the spending announcement was 'categorically not' to distract from Partygate.", "8dcb18fe7f8fc525064da474db8e3d699ca858c450fcd7022d864b59": "Social anxiety is a very real mental health condition.

The film - which sees Austin in the lead role - received a 12-minute standing ovation upon its debut, with the 30-year-old's performance being singled out for praise. With Elvis set to hit cinemas in the next few weeks, it's fair to say his star is very much on the rise, but what you might not realise is that there's every chance you've already seen him either on TV or the silver screen. Here are nine of Austin Butler's former projects you may well have seen him in...  Hannah Montana  Austin began acting professionally as a teenager, appearing as Lionel Scranton in over 40 episodes of the Nickelodeon series Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide. But that's far from the only teen show Austin appeared in during that period. As well as Zoey 101, iCarly and Wizards Of Waverly Place, Austin shared the screen with Miley Cyrus in an episode of Disney's Hannah Montana, when he was around 15 years old. Ruby & The Rockits Starring teen idol David Cassidy (and created by his brother Shaun), the sitcom Ruby & The Rockits centred around a once-famous musical family who have retired from the limelight and their lives after fame. Austin appeared as the lead character Ruby's son Jordan Gallagher, who gave several musical performances over the course of the show.  Aliens In The Attic Having already racked up appearances in several teen comedies, Austin's first feature-length film role came in 2009, when he appeared in the family adventure Aliens In The Attic. For those unfortunate enough to have missed it, the film - which co-starred Ashley Tisdale and Carter Jenkins - deals with a family whose children discover some aliens. Spoiler alert: They're in the attic. Sharpay's Fabulous Adventure And speaking of Ashley Tisdale, her iconic High School Musical character received her own spin-off, Sharpay's Fabulous Adventure, in 2011. The musical film reunited Aliens In The Attic stars Austin and Ashley, with the former playing an aspiring film director who convinces Sharpay to be the star of his next project. It's completely ridiculous, and therefore a must-watch. The Carrie Diaries While we're on the subject of must-watches, we were skeptical about Sex And The City prequel The Carrie Diaries when it was first announced, but ended up loving it, and we definitely don't feel it gets enough love. Austin was one of the main cast members in both seasons of The Carrie Diaries, playing Carrie Bradshaw's first ever love, Sebastian Kydd. Arrow Austin appeared in the superhero crime drama as a DJ who catches the eye of Thea Queen, played by Willa Holland. His character, Chase, was a recurring role in the third season, with Austin racking up three episodes in total.  Yoga Hosers Yoga Hosers formed part of filmmaker Kevin Smith's 'True North trilogy', alongside Tusk and Moose Jaws. Like the rest of the trilogy, Yoga Hosers featured appearances from Johnny Depp and his daughter Lily-Rose, Justin Long and Haley Joel Osment, as well as Adam Brody, Tony Hale and Nastasha Lyonne. The comedy horror - which centred around two teenage yoga enthusiasts who end up fighting a battle with zombie Nazis - was completely panned by critics. The Dead Don't Die Another comedy horror in Austin Butler's back catalogue, which boasted a seriously impressive star-studded cast including Billy Murray, Tilda Swinton, Chloe Sevingny and Adam Driver. Austin's character was one of a trio of travellers, sharing the screen with Selena Gomez and Luke Sabbat. Once Upon A Time In Hollywood Undoubtedly Austin's most prolific role to date was in the Oscar-winning Quentin Tarantino film Once Upon A Time In Hollywood. Austin appeared as Charles Denton 'Tex' Watson, a real-life member of the so-called Manson Family, who was responsible for the murder of Sharon Tate, an event which is reimagined by Tarantino within the film.

If that's true, then why do we sometimes feel so unsettled - weird, even - when life is calm or everything feels settled? This can feel like your heart racing when you're lying in bed or your thoughts spiralling when watching TV. Or, it might be a tendency to pack your schedule to avoid having downtime.  When you're used to living with stress, getting a break can actually trigger anxiety. Nadia Addesi, social worker and psychotherapist, addressed this in a TikTok: 'If you feel anxious even though things in your life are finally where you want them to be, it can be because you've been so used to living in chaos that you don't trust the feeling of being calm,' she stated. Quiet can feel suspicious if you aren't used to it. 'Your brain thinks it always needs to be in survival mode,' she added. 'It's waiting for the next bad thing to happen.'  Calm often comes before the storm of anxiety -- but why? Therapists share the most common reasons why being calm can make you anxious.   Deeper-level anxieties rise to the surface 'In quiet times, thoughts and anxieties that are usually tucked away and buffered by the busyness of day-to-day life come to the surface,' says Samantha Gambino, a licensed clinical psychologist based in New York City. 'These are generally deeper-level anxieties, maybe about life phases, life transitions or underlying concerns.' She explained the break from 'everyday tasks, racing thoughts and feelings, and life demands' is what gives your brain space to focus on the deeper anxieties.   'When our environment becomes calm, our minds appear louder,' says Mitch Keil, a licensed clinical psychologist in California. 'For most of us, our minds are not a place of refuge. They contain voices of concern, criticism, worry, insecurity and fear.'   You are used to thinking of worst-case scenarios It's hard to enjoy the water if you're worried about a shark. 'During calm times, most with anxiety have learned to falsely associate the present ease with a coming storm,' Keil says. Your anxious mind will tell you that something bad always follows something good, so you can't rest. 'Many individuals predict the worst-case scenario, catastrophise situations, or are waiting for the other shoe to drop,' Gambino adds. 'So, in good times, they cannot enjoy the experience and be in the present.'  You're too focused on preserving the good times  On the other hand, you may become obsessed with staying in the good times. 'Those that tend to struggle with anxiety often have a belief that they can capture states of calm and preserve them long-term,' Keil says. 'They forget the transient, impermanent nature of life and emotion.' Accepting that the good times may not last forever, instead of holding on to them as tightly as you can, can extend happy times because they aren't ruined by anxiety. Feeling anxious is a habit Having anxious thoughts can feel automatic, explains Alisa Kamis-Brinda, owner and psychotherapist at Serenity Solutions, LLC in Philadelphia. 'When someone is resting, it is common for their mind to think how it always does, worrying and having anxious thoughts, even if there is nothing in that moment to make them feel anxious,' she said. It doesn't matter if the anxiety is warranted or not; if your brain is used to doing something, it'll do it. 'People are creatures of habit, which means we become conditioned to our environments, situations, and experiences because they are what we can expect - whether it is safe, makes sense or is helpful,' says Janika Joyner, a therapist and owner of Higher Elevation Psychosocial Services, LLC in Chesapeake, Virginia.   Feeling calm is unfamiliar 'For people who are used to living with stress, loud noises and chaos, a calm environment can feel uncomfortable and weird,' Kamis-Brinda says. She compares it to a person who lives in a loud city, who can't sleep on vacation in a quiet countryside 'because the quiet is deafening to them.'  Being anxious is part of your identity 'Some people do not know what to do with themselves when they are not anxious,' Gambino says.  If your identity is connected to 'being nervous and unsettled,' Gambino says, then moments of calm can be overwhelming because your 'identity is compromised.' 'They are unsure of who they are without their anxiety, which ends up causing anxiety,' she said. You're experiencing delayed-onset anxiety Maybe you went through a demanding project at work or dealt with an unexpected emergency that required a cool head. When it was over, you may experience a delayed-onset anxiety. 'When people are able to remain calm during stressful situations, the anxiety often shows up after the stress has ended,' Kamis-Brinda says.  Your body's adapted to a constant state of anxiety Anxiety can cause changes in breathing, elevated heart rate, nausea, racing thoughts and other physical and mental changes, according to Ernesto Lira de la Rosa, a licensed clinical psychologist and media advisor for the Hope for Depression Research Foundation.  'If we feel anxious most of the time, our body will go into protective mode and ensure that it adapts to our current state,' Lira de la Rosa said.  Because of this, you may not always realise when you've been carrying a lot of anxiety. 'We adapt to this environment and all of the anxious thoughts, physiological symptoms, and other anxiety symptoms become our new normal,' he said.  Taking a break makes you feel lazy Everyone deserves rest, but living in a productivity-obsessed, capitalist society can make you feel guilty for taking a break. 'For anxious people who are used to always doing things, having free time often leads to thoughts that they should be doing something,' Kamis-Brinda says.  'This is particularly common in our society where productivity is looked upon favorably, whereas relaxing, doing something enjoyable (and non-productive), or doing nothing is seen as lazy,' she adds. Perfectionists are particularly susceptible to this. 'Perfectionists believe that they should always be productive and overextend themselves with tasks and responsibilities,' Joyner says. 'They tend to associate their self-worth and value with their accomplishments.'  You may have relaxation-induced anxiety A 1988 study published in the Journal of Behaviour Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry found those with RIA may have a fear of becoming anxious or a fear of losing control brought on when they are relaxed.  'Relaxation-induced panic or anxiety occurs for some when attempting to use relaxation strategies, such as progressive muscle relaxation or deep breathing,' says Brooke Schwartz, a therapist based in Los Angeles. 'In trying to calm their normally anxious bodies and minds, they experience a paradoxical experience of increased anxiety due to a difficulty letting go and a perceived lack of control.'  It could be a trauma response Finally, you could also be experiencing a trauma response, according to Schwartz. 'If in the past something anxiety- or fear-inducing happened when you were calm or relaxed, feeling calm may be a signal to the body that a threat is coming,' she said. Or maybe someone made you feel bad for relaxing in the past. 'Perhaps someone was rewarded by their parents for keeping busy as a child - the subtle messaging here is that there's something wrong with being content with what is, which gets internalised and integrated into one's own thoughts about themselves over time,' she explains.  How to actually enjoy the calm moments Relaxing should be fun - and there are ways to enjoy the good times again. Start by taking a break from being productive. 'Productivity addiction is a real thing,' Keil says. 'We live in competitive, uncertain, success-oriented culture and productivity has become an anxiety-soothing reflex.'  'Find activities and pursuits that you enjoy for the sheer process, with no beneficial outcome,' he continues. 'This is vital ingredient in the good life and can help immensely with anxiety. As you find these engagements, let go of the guilt again and again and again. It is a toxic guilt that will steal your ability to fully participate and enjoy the life right in front of you.' Psychotherapy and mindfulness can also help you manage your symptoms and change your anxiety-increasing behaviour, according to Keil. Reach out to a mental health professional to learn more.  No amount of extra work will replace the joy of doing something you love and living in the moment. With a little help, you can fully enjoy resting.", "d07e13cdeb79693036ac0bb2d1447d78229959264f48eee1caeca431": "Have your wages stayed the same for months, years even? Chances are, yes - unless you work in a leadership position at an extremely profitable business. Unsurprisingly, the pay gap between those leading UK companies and ordinary workers is widening again. And yet, some higher-ups think we've got our priorities wrong for calling out this wealth inequality.   Earlier in the week, Emily Fielder, head of communications at the free market think tank, the Adam Smith Institute, told the Telegraph while 'fretting about CEO pay might make for a good headline, getting involved would do little to increase workers' wages and benefits to shareholders.' She added: 'The UK should be adopting policies which will get the economy growing again, rather than undertaking a PR exercise in the politics of envy.' That old chestnut. The 'politics of envy' has been bandied about as a phrase for years now, not least in headlines. In 2019: 'The next Tory PM must confront the politics of envy.' In 2017: 'Labour is cultivating the politics of envy with its manifesto.' And back in 2011: 'The politics of envy will destroy the City of London.' The City seems to be doing just fine, as it happens. And while the pandemic narrowed the distance between what FTSE bosses and the rest of the workforce earn, it's growing again, with the gap expected to widen for the rest of 2022.  The High Pay Centre, another think thank that researches this area, said pay ratios were widest in retail and lowest in media and financial services.  Across the 69 companies that disclosed pay ratios in the first quarter of 2022, the median ratio between CEO and employee was nearly double what it was for the same group of companies in 2021.  According to the High Pay Centre's latest analysis of chief executive pay, the average FTSE 100 boss was paid PS2.69m in 2020. While that figure was 86 times the pay of the average full-time UK worker, it marked actually a 17% drop from PS3.25m in 2019 (in the US, the gap between CEOs and workers was a mammoth 351 times higher for certain companies based on 2020 data).  Given this pay disparity persists amid the worst cost of living crisis this country has seen for decades, Fielder's comments on the 'politics of envy' seem particularly egregious. And to the people whose wages have stagnated, it's painful to hear. They aren't 'envious' of the obscene amount of money their bosses earn, they just want better conditions and pay that reflects their hard work. Yusuf*, who works for a retail company that pocketed more than PS500m during the first pandemic year (down from even more astronomical figures), was earning below average at the time. But the owners of the company have just made the Sunday Times Rich List 2022. The Londoner, 34, saw his bosses and CEOs line their pockets while he took in PS25,000 a year (after initially starting on PS21,000). This despite working late nights, early mornings, and weekends.  He tells HuffPost UK: 'It's ironic that the company talked about career growth and mental wellbeing. Yet, our salaries didn't reflect that, neither did communications with higher-ups, I didn't feel supported or valued despite working beyond my remit and contractual hours. 'Our team undertook a great deal of work and the new management thought that buying a couple of lucky dip lottery tickets for us sufficed as a reward - this was our Christmas present. At the next team meeting, [our boss] boasted how much he had changed the department - it was our hard work that did this. 'Places like this are toxic.' After four years of this, Yusuf left his job, and not because he didn't like the work he did. He simply wanted better pay and more respect.  Many workers are in the same boat as Yusuf. And they are being especially tested right now, according to the High Pay Centre, making the 'politics of envy' commentary more harmful, it says. 'The argument put forward by the Adam Smith Institute is damaging,' an HPC spokesperson tells HuffPost UK. 'It suggests our critique of these pay gaps is based on envy, rather than our actual view, which is that pay distribution is not proportionate to the contribution different employees bring to a company's success, and based on a false notion that there is a very small number of exceptional people who would be capable of leading a company.' It also ignores the fact that paying workers higher wages is beneficial to the companies, too, the High Pay Centre suggests. 'Paying those on low and middle incomes more would likely have a positive impact on economic growth, as these demographics spend a far higher proportion of their incomes in the real economy, whereas those on exceptionally high incomes are more likely to hoard their wealth rather than spend it.' With inflation, Brexit, the Ukraine-Russia war, and the pandemic raging on, many UK workers are in a precarious situation. Tone-deaf statements not only ignore their plight, but side-step the real issue. Workers don't want a piece of the exploitative pie, they just want fair pay and conditions.  *Name changed to offer anonymity.

On Thursday, chancellor Rishi Sunak bowed to pressure to hand every household a PS400 energy bill discount in a move partly funded by a PS5 billion windfall tax on oil and gas giants. It was part of PS15 billion of measures to tackle the impact of soaring inflation, which has reached a 40-year high. But Tory ministers have spent weeks dismissing the need for the levy on the profits of energy companies, and not a single Conservative MP voted in favour of the policy when Labour put it to a vote last week. The plan was unveiled a day after the publication of Sue Gray's partygate report, which painted a damning picture of booze-fuelled lockdown partying into the early hours, cleaners having to scrub red wine off the walls, a fight between staff, and a karaoke machine at the ready.  On the BBC's flagship politics show from Belfast on Thursday, members of the public appeared not be fooled by any attempt to soften the blow of the inquiry. One said: 'In my opinion, it's typical Conservatives. They knew what was coming with the Sue Gray report. And this is just something to deflect from partygate and the disgrace that they are as a government.' Another added: 'Throughout the pandemic, this government has acted too late, and they've really only acted now, which again is too late, because of what was announced yesterday, with the Sue Gray report. 'If the Sue Gray report hadn't come out, we wouldn't be getting this windfall tax. That's it. They voted against it last week. It's seven days, I know it's a long time in politics, but we've all got long memories.' On the panel, Alliance party leader Naomi Long said it was 'hard not to be cynical', adding: 'A blind man on a galloping horse would see this for what it is. 'Essentially what we have here is the government wanting to deflect from a bad news day yesterday and coming forward with a package of measures today that will hopefully get them some good publicity.' But Robert Buckland, a Conservative MP and former minister, said the announcement had to be made before recess on Thursday, or face a 10-day delay, and that 'I just want the government to get on with it'. He added: 'I think the reality is that we saw some of the debate going on about the merits of the windfall tax. 'There clearly was an issue about whether or not it would be right to single out this particular industry. 'And frankly, the precise mechanism that we now have took a bit of time to sort out, but we've had the announcement and I think it's most welcome.'", "81cbd16f8b1e1fd670214e3c533de78ac8d935161885896fbcae3d5b": "This review contains major spoilers for the Abba Voyage live show.  If ABBA had ever accepted the rumoured offer of $1billion to reform for a reunion tour a few years back, the anticipation of seeing Agnetha, Bjorn, Benny and Anni-Frid back on stage for the first time in forty years would've been at fever pitch. Walking into the multi-million pound, purpose-built ABBA Arena in East London for the very first night of the ABBA Voyage show, there is that heightened sense of anticipation, but it's laced with an overwhelming feeling of 'what the hell am I about to experience?' Shrouded in secrecy, despite months of hype and tantalising teasers, the band's Bjorn and Benny repeatedly stated that it was definitely not going to be one of those posthumous hologram shows put on for the likes of Whitney Houston and Frank Sinatra. They also struggled to truly explain what the difference would be, other than that instead of being holograms, each member of the group would be performing as digital avatars (or ABBAtars as they have become known), which sounded a lot like... holograms. After witnessing the first ever performance of the show, I can see why Bjorn and Benny struggled to explain it. I can also understand why they kept their cards so close to their chest. It is quite simply, awe-inspiring. 'We're playing tricks with people's minds and they're willing to let us,' Bjorn said ahead of the show's premiere. 'For the time fans are in the arena, they believe we are real and are on stage. They're at a concert with ABBA.' He's not wrong. From the moment we get our first glimpse of the group - reimagined as 21st century pop stars - it's abundantly clear that this is definitely not a hologram show.  As the four ABBAtars arrive on stage we are all instantly transported into a universe where the real and digital worlds collide. The entire arena is wrapped in swathes of light and sound. If the acoustics weren't so impressive, I swear I would have heard 3000 jaws simultaneously hit the floor. And just as I was popping my jaw back into place, it's gone again at the realisation that the opening song is not one of the group's mega-hits but the title track - and firm fan favourite - from their 1981 studio album, The Visitors. 'I have been waiting for these visitors,' Anni-Frid sings.  Not half as much the adoring crowd have been waiting for them. Then it's into another deep cut, Hole In Your Soul, a nod to the group's final tour, in 1979 when it was last performed. That was 'peak ABBA', which is why the versions of the band we see on stage tonight are based on that era, albeit with 21st century hairstyles and wardrobes courtesy of Dolce & Gabbana, Manish Arora, Erevos Aether and Michael Schmidt. Does Your Mother Know sees Bjorn get his solo moment, but after one verse he disappears to give the (real life) backing singers and excellent live band their moment in the sun. Speaking of which, Chiquitita is performed in front of a giant eclipsing sun, perfectly timed to fully disappear as the song ends. The crowd go nuts. If I had to nitpick at where some momentum is lost it would be the two songs that didn't feature the ABBAtars. Instead, Eagle and Voulez-Vous were accompanied by an animated story. Maybe I was missing something, but not having them perform the latter felt like a missed opportunity, especially after they'd just donned those futuristic Tron-like outfits seen in the promo pics to perform a fully choreographed (courtesy of Wayne McGregor), explosive version of Lay All Your Love On Me. Maybe the ABBAtars needed to catch their breath? Some of the audience certainly needed to freshen up as many opted to head to the bar at this point. Unnecessary animation aside, there were some genuinely warm and humorous moments in between numbers when the band 'interacted' with the crowd. At one point Benny started playing the opening notes of the EastEnders theme tune (yes, really), which is when I genuinely thought I'd entered a parallel universe. It certainly felt that way in the arena. Like the (super) troopers that they are, they saved the best to last . There wasn't a single bum on seat - including those belonging to Kylie Minogue, Kate Moss, Keira Knightley and the King and Queen of Sweden who were all in the audience - for the finale of Waterloo, Dancing Queen and The Winner Takes It All, at which point the emotional connection between the group and the audience was palpable. I walked into that arena thinking 'what the hell am I about to experience?' and walked out buzzing with an overwhelming sense of 'what the hell have I just witnessed?' The future, that's what.

With inflation already at a 40-year high of 9% (and 10.9% for households with the lowest incomes in the UK) and skyrocketing energy bills, there's no question that the general population has been facing a serious squeeze on their budgets. The government initially resisted calls to provide more help after Sunak's spring statement was criticised for its minimal measures, but has since U-turned with this latest announcement. Here's how the experts think the Treasury's news will actually impact people - and whether any of the actions goes far enough. 1. PS400 extra for energy bills in a grant What is it? Every UK household will now be able to get PS400 for their energy bills. It was previously a PS200 loan, but as a grant (which is double in size), it no longer needs to be paid back over five years. The payment will be automatic on smart metres or go straight on direct debit and credit customers' accounts. For those paying in a different way, they'll receive it through vouchers. This payment will be spread over six months for everyone. It will also directly apply to households in England, Scotland and Wales. A similar amount should be handed to Northern Ireland, but the distribution method for that is yet to be announced. What does it mean for you? While this will undoubtedly help the crisis, the average yearly energy bill has increased by PS700 ever since Ofgem lifted the energy price cap at the beginning of April. Then, from October, it is set to increase again by PS800 - meaning a total increase of PS1,500 for the average household for its annual energy bill. The extra PS400 alleviates this pressure, but does not remove it. What have critics said? This particular measure was praised by MoneySavingExpert's Martin Lewis, as it meant people no longer have to repay the money to the government, as Sunak initially outlined. 2. PS650 payment for the worst-off households What is it? Approximately eight million of the lowest income households will be sent a one-off payment of PS650 if they are on Universal Credit, tax credits, pension credits and other means-tested benefits. This money will go indirectly into people's bank accounts in two lump sums, first in July, then later in autumn. What does it mean for you? This money can go towards bills or living costs. With the average household facing an extra charge of PS1,200 per year - and the lowest-income homes facing inflation of 10.9% - this could be a significant boost to help. What have critics said? For some, this announcement was praised, with Save The Children saying it offers 'breathing space' for those struggling. Director of Generation Rent, Alicia Kennedy, also admitted that this package is 'much closer to what people will need to manage rising prices' but pointed out that 'one in three tenants have had rent rises this year'. She added: 'For renters living in homes where energy bills are included in the rent, such as shared houses, it is not clear if the landlord is under any obligation to pass this new support to them through a reduced rent. 'The government needs to clarify how it will ensure renters receive the package of support as the chancellor intended.' She added that the local housing allowance is still frozen at 2019-20 levels, too, and has not risen with inflation. The Social Market Foundation, a public policy think-tank, praised the announcements and said these were 'the simplest and most effective way for the government to deliver much-needed help'. Aveek Bhattacharya, the chief economist for SMF, said: 'Having wasted months with over-elaborate schemes, it is extremely welcome that he has joined us in recognising that the best way to help struggling families is the most straightforward: give them cash they need to deal with higher prices.' 3. Extra payment for pensioners PS300 What is it? From the autumn, eight million pensioner households will receive PS300 to help pay for winter fuel in November or December. Those on lower incomes who also receive pension credit will receive the PS650 as well. This one-off payment is alongside the Winter Fuel Payment, which is between PS100 and PS300. What does it mean for you? For those born on 26 September 1955 or before, living in the UK for at least one day during the week of 20-26 September 2021, you qualify for this payment. Alternatively, you can qualify if you live in Switzerland or a European Economic Area country, and you can prove you have a genuine and sufficient link to the UK. People typically receive this money automatically and don't have to apply for it.  What have critics said? The Centre For Ageing Better claimed earlier this year that an additional 200,000 people of pension age fell into poverty. In response to the announcements today, the non-profit said: 'Greater efforts are needed to tackle the systemic issues that continue to push pensioners into poverty and erode the quality of people's later lives. 'More than one in six people of pension age in the UK are in relative poverty and today's announcements will only go some way to tackling this.' 4. One-off disability cost of living payment PS150 What is it? This one-off payment of PS150 for those living with disabilities may come on top of the payments Sunak has already announced. What does it mean for you? Charities warned in March that the 14 million disabled people in the UK could be driven into debt because of the increased cost of living. Charity Scope previously claimed disabled people are facing an extra cost of PS583 due to the increase in energy bills. What have critics said? Lewis said this was definitely good news, as those living with disabilities often have higher energy costs because they use extra equipment. In response to Sunak's announcement, Scope tweeted: 'It's significant to get this frank acknowledgment from the chancellor. But this targeted support support cannot be a one-off.' The charity added: 'One payment won't do it. Long-term support is needed to counter the extra costs that disabled people face.' What else do you need to know about these announcements? It is important to note that these benefits do not counteract each other. People who receive universal credit and disability payments will still be able to receive both of the additional payments announced by Sunak this week. These payments are partially from Sunak's windfall tax on oil and gas companies which is a temporary levy. It should raise PS5 billion over the next year. The Treasury will also have to use funds from elsewhere to manage these extra costs. The cost of living is also still going up, with prices rising faster than they have done since the 1980s. Prices are not set to fall for the next year and beyond. Energy bills are set to continue climbing far beyond what analysts had anticipated while food prices and fuel costs are also not going to decline any time soon. The chancellor did admit that he could not remove the problem for everyone, but was trying to reduce general pressure. What else could have been suggested? Labour pointed out there were several other steps the government could have taken to help with the crisis. This includes tackling the tax privileges those with non-domicile status enjoy, introducing an emergency budget, cutting VAT and stopping the young working people paying more for their National Insurance Contributions.", "8e58050be09e23aff78f6b178bcde7b8bfabd748f4839a7c48743cc7": "A former Conservative minister has confirmed they have submitted a letter calling for Boris Johnson to be removed as prime minister. Stephen Hammond, the MP for Wimbledon, said the Sur Gray report into partygate was 'damning' for Johnson. 'I cannot and will not defend the indefensible,' the former transport minister said in a statement. 'It's almost impossible for the PM to say I want to move on, as we cannot move on without regaining public trust and I am not sure that's possible in the current situation.' Hammond added: 'All I can do as a backbencher is speak out and submit a letter.' He is the fourth MP to call for Johnson to resign since the Gray report was published on Wednesday. Earlier today, John Baron, John Baron the MP for Basildon and Billericay, and David Simmonds, the MP for Ruislip, joined calls for the prime minister to step down.   Julian Sturdy, the MP for York Outer, yesterday also said the PM should resign. Gray detailed a culture of 'excessive drinking' in No.10, with wine being spilled up the walls, fights and people being sick. The Downing Street cleaners and security guards, Gray found, were also treated with a 'lack of respect' by staff. Johnson has said he 'overwhelmingly' believes he should remain in office and has rejected calls for him to quit. It takes 54 Tory MPs to force a no confidence vote in Johnson in order to remove him as leader. So far around 20 have publicly demanded he quit, however the number who have secretly formally submitted a letter of no confidence could be higher.

It happened when Sky News reporter Mark Stone asked the pro-gun Texan Republican whether Monday's shooting in Uvalde, Texas, represented an opportunity to reform gun laws. Cruz, who is among the top recipients of campaign contributions from gun lobbyists, didn't like the question and suggested the reporter was politicising the tragedy. 'You know, it's easy to go to politics,' he said, before dismissing previous suggestions to curb gun violence. 'The proposals from Democrats and the media? Inevitably, when some violent psychopath murders people... if you want to stop violent crime, the proposals the Democrats have? None of them would have stopped this,' Cruz claimed. Stone followed up by noting that America is 'exceptional' when it comes to mass shootings -- with 288 school shootings between 2009 and 2018 -- 280 more than the next leading country, Mexico. 'Why only in America? Why is this American exceptionalism so awful?,' Stone asked. Cruz bristled at Stone's use of the popular Republican buzzword and used it to focus his answer on anything but the question asked. 'You know, I'm sorry you think American exceptionalism is awful. You've got your political agenda. God love you...' Cruz said. The reporter was undaunted. 'Senator, I just want to understand why you do not think that guns are the problem. It's just an American problem,' he asked. When Cruz walked away, Stone asked again, 'You can't answer that, can you?'  Cruz then accused Stone of not appreciating the US. 'Why is it that people come from all over the world to America? Because it's the freest, most prosperous, safest country on Earth. Stop being a propagandist.' While Cruz avoided answering questions about America's gun violence problem, he attempted to offer possible solutions. He suggested a solution to school shootings is fewer doorways and more guns -- a suggestion that many found ludicrous. On Thursday, Cruz showed that he will continue to stand firm with his friends in the gun lobby and will speak at the National Rifle Association (NRA) convention this coming weekend in Houston. 'I'm going to be there because what Democrats and the press try to do in the wake of every mass shooting is they try to demonise law-abiding gun owners, try to demonise the NRA,' he told CBS Dallas-Fort Worth.", "f5f8019303fddb80f180d442a762a4a3c89a7832980952aa400dc075": "", "8bb710da286cdcd18bab68efbfa009467577b1b8d8229188869b299d": "Hollywood actor Ray Liotta, known for his roles in films like Goodfellas, Field Of Dreams and Something Wild, has died at the age of 67. On Thursday, Deadline reported that the US star had died in his sleep while in the Dominican Republic, where he had been working on the upcoming film Dangerous Waters, which was later confirmed by his representatives to the PA news agency. Ray began acting professionally in New York in the late 1970s, appearing for several years in the soap Another World, after which he moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in film. In 1986, he appeared in Something Wild, which bagged him his first Golden Globe nomination for his performance as Ray Sinclair. From there, he portrayed baseball player Shoeless Joe Jackson in Field Of Dreams and went on to land his most prolific role as real-life mobster Henry Hill in Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas. His other big-screen credits include Hannibal, Blow, John Q and the TV movie The Rat Pack, playing Frank Sinatra. Ray also lent his voice to the game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City in 2002, in which he played mobster Tommy Vercetti. In more recent years, Ray had been enjoying something of a resurgence in his acting career, appearing in the Sopranos sequel The Many Saints Of Newark as twins Aldo and Salvatore Molisanti, the period drama No Sudden Move and the Oscar-winning Netflix film Marriage Story. He had also recently completed filming on the Apple TV+ miniseries Black Bird, which co-stars Taron Egerton and Greg Kinnear, and the Elizabeth Banks horror film Cocaine Bear.

Director-general Tim Davie announced to staff on Thursday that 1,000 jobs will be cut across the public-funded part of the BBC. BBC World News and BBC News Channel will merge to create a single 24-hour TV news channel serving both UK and international audiences. Regional TV news programmes in Oxford and Cambridge are also among the services being scrapped - merging with the BBC's Southampton and Norwich operations.   BBC Four and CBBC are expected to move online to the iPlayer, while Radio 4 Extra could become available on the BBC Sounds service only. Mr Davie told staff: 'This is our moment to build a digital-first BBC. Something genuinely new, a Reithian organisation for the digital age, a positive force for the UK and the world. 'Independent, impartial, constantly innovating and serving all. A fresh, new, global digital media organisation which has never been seen before. 'Driven by the desire to make life and society better for our licence fee payers and customers in every corner of the UK and beyond. They want us to keep the BBC relevant and fight for something that in 2022 is more important than ever. 'To do that we need to evolve faster and embrace the huge shifts in the market around us.' The first phase of savings represents PS500 million annual savings and reinvestment. As part of this, PS200 million will contribute to the PS285 million annual funding gap by 2027/28 created by the licence fee freeze. The remaining gap will be covered in the final three years of the charter period. The news comes off the back of the BBC needing to save a further PS285 million in response to the Culture Secretary's announcement in January that the licence fee will be frozen at PS159 for the next two years.   It has already undergone a series of rounds of redundancies and cuts over the past decade prompted by below-inflation increases in the licence fee. Mr Davie, who took over from Lord Tony Hall as BBC director-general in September 2020, has overseen a slimming down of the corporation since starting in the role, with the BBC losing some 1,200 staff in the last 18 months. BBC Four, which is home to BBC Proms, BBC Young Dancer and BBC Young Musician, was launched in 2002 and has traditionally shown mainly arts and documentary content, as well as various international dramas. However, last year the corporation announced it would become the 'home' of archived content and that it would broadcast fewer original programmes. Philippa Childs, head of broadcasting union Bectu, said: 'We recognise the need for organisations to change and adapt and welcome the BBC's commitment to step up to the challenges of a changing media landscape and build a digital-first corporation. 'However, once again we see the impact of poorly judged political decisions on workers as the Government's decision to freeze the licence fee has instigated these real-term job cuts. 'This announcement lays bare that below the political shrill about the BBC is the reality - hugely talented and dedicated people who work hard to deliver critical services to the nation and beyond are now facing yet more job losses and continued uncertainty. 'Bectu will fully engage in every aspect of these proposals and we will be doing everything we can to support our members. We will be working to ensure that change is not cost cutting for the sake of it, but truly does position the BBC strongly for the future and delivers the best possible outcomes for members.'   The News Media Association (NMA) described the BBC's proposal to boost its own local news services as 'misguided' as it feels it will have a 'profoundly negative impact' on independent local news providers. Owen Meredith, chief executive of the UK's news media trade group, said: 'It is disappointing that the BBC has not taken the opportunity presented to it by the licence fee funding settlement to step back from its misguided plans to boost its own local news services, in direct competition with commercial providers. 'If they go ahead, these proposals would have a profoundly negative impact upon independent local news providers, resulting in a weakening of local news provision in this country.' Earlier on Thursday, the culture secretary issued the BBC with a legal direction ordering it to 'promote equality of opportunity' for people from working-class backgrounds. The stipulation came as part of the mid-term review into its royal charter and includes a target for 25% of staff to be from low socio-economic backgrounds and ensuring 50% of radio and 60% of TV programme production spend is outside London by the end of 2027. The BBC must also deliver 1,000 apprenticeships per year by 2025 and ensure that 30% of those are from low socio-economic groups. The corporation also faces uncertainty over the future of the licence fee after Nadine Dorries announced a consultation about the future funding of the broadcaster will begin shortly. The minister has said she wants to find a new funding model before the current deal expires in 2027 as it is 'completely outdated'.", "460e3ddb24b7f6cfd0ce42b0452c848382c25818b373daf20310543f": "The Labour Party has again told MP Claudia Webbe to resign after she lost her appeal against her conviction for harassing a love rival. The former Labour MP currently represents her Leicester East constituency as an independent after being expelled from the party. However, she lost her appeal against her harassment conviction on Thursday prompting the party to call on her to step down.  A spokesperson for the party said: 'The allegations in this case were extremely serious. 'The Labour Party rightly expects elected representatives to maintain the very highest standards at all times. 'Ms Webbe should now resign so the people of Leicester East can get the representation they deserve.' Although she lost her appeal, Webbe's sentence has been reduced after a judge found she did not threaten the victim with acid. Webbe was last year found guilty and handed a 10-week suspended sentence after targeting Michelle Merritt, 59, between September 2018 and April 2020.  She had faced the prospect of a recall petition, which could have resulted in a by-election in her constituency, as a result of the suspended custodial sentence originally imposed. The reduced, non-custodial sentence means she now avoids that prospect and the only way to trigger a by-election would be if she stepped down.  Prosecutors said the 18-month harassment campaign was driven by 'obsession' and 'jealousy' over her boyfriend Lester Thomas's relationship with executive assistant Merritt. Sexual text messages between the pair, which were revealed for the first time during Webbe's appeal hearing at Southwark Crown Court, proved the pair were having an affair. Helen Law, defending argued the messages showed Merritt had repeatedly lied, having told the magistrates' court they were just 'good friends'. But on Thursday, following an appeal hearing at Southwark Crown Court Judge Deborah Taylor and two magistrates dismissed the appeal. The judge said: 'We found that although Michelle Merritt was an unsatisfactory witness who told lies about the nature of her relationship with Lester Thomas until the downloads from her phone made the nature of the relationship clear, in other respects we accept her evidence.' She reduced Webbe's suspended sentence to a 12-month community order of 80 hours unpaid work, although Webbe has already carried out 150 hours, and cut the compensation from PS1,000 to PS50. The judge said the evidence differed 'considerably' from that heard in the magistrates' court. After the hearing, Webbe said in a statement: 'I am deeply shocked by today's outcome. 'As I said in court and repeat now, I have never threatened violence nor would I.'

A report in the Times earlier this month suggested that Suella Braverman had given Boris Johnson the green light to 'rip up' the Northern Ireland protocol that ensures checks on goods entering the province from mainland Britain. According to the newspaper, Braverman advised the PM that overriding the agreement would be legal because the EU's implementation of it had been 'disproportionate and unreasonable'. But Thornberry, the shadow attorney general, pointed to a convention that bans law officers from disclosing any legal advice they give without the government's authority - a move that if broken would be a breach of the ministerial code and warrant a resignation. The ministerial code reads: 'The fact that the law officers have advised or have not advised and the content of their advice must not be disclosed outside government without their authority.' Thornberry said: 'The attorney general said again today that there is a long-standing convention that prevents her from discussing either the fact or the content of her legal advice on the Northern Ireland protocol, which makes it all the more remarkable that, on Wednesday 11 May, The Times newspaper and BBC Newsnight not only disclosed the fact of her legal advice, but actually quoted from its contents.' 'Let me ask her a very straightforward question that requires only a yes or no answer: did she personally authorise the briefings to The Times and Newsnight regarding her advice on the protocol -- yes or no?' Braverman hit back to say she took the convention 'incredibly seriously' and added: 'I do not comment on media speculation, and that is the government's line. 'The measures proposed there are to protect peace in Northern Ireland, to protect the Belfast agreement and to protect our precious United Kingdom.' It is understood that Braverman felt unable to offer any further comment because confirming 'yes or no' could potentially disclose the fact there has been advice.  It would then be considered a breach of convention, which does not allow for either a confirmation or denial of advice given. Later in the Commons exchange, Braverman was then interrupted by deputy speaker Eleanor Laing, who rebuked Thornberry by saying: 'It is not correct for her to sit there shouting.' Visibly irritated, Braverman went on to say she was 'very disappointed at her line of attack'. 'I love the United Kingdom; the right honourable lady is embarrassed by our flag,' Braverman continued, referring to the incident where Thornberry tweeted a picture of a house draped in the St George's flag with a white van parked outside. 'I am proud of the leadership that the United Kingdom has demonstrated; she wants us to be run by Brussels and wants to scrap Trident. 'My heroes are Churchill and Thatcher; hers are Lenin and Corbyn -- when it comes to UK leadership in the world, Labour does not have a clue!' Tensions with the EU over the protocol have reached a new height after foreign secretary Liz Truss announced her intent to table legislation in parliament that would override parts of the protocol without the approval of the EU. The bill will propose separate 'green' and 'red' lanes for goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, with those destined to stay within the UK freed from EU-level checks. Her intervention prompted an angry reaction from Brussels, which signalled that such a move could trigger a trade war between the two sides as well as legal action. On Wednesday Ireland's foreign affairs minister accused the UK government of pushing a 'disingenuous' and 'dangerous' claim that the protocol was incompatible with the Good Friday Agreement. 'I find it deeply disappointing that the British government has said it intends to table legislation in the coming weeks that will unilaterally disapply elements of the protocol, which is now international law,' he told the Irish parliament. 'This action is contrary to the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement, where genuine trust and partnership between both governments have time and time again proved crucial to share progress. 'As the protocol is an integral part of an international agreement, such action would amount to a serious violation of international law also. 'I've urged the British government to reconsider, to weigh the risks that would flow from unilateral action, and to step back from this course of action as they have done previously.'", "5f962778e87347726be7b9b1af5c9b2671254de1c390367f2171296f": "Kevin Spacey has been charged with four counts of sexual assault against three different men, the Crown Prosecution Service has announced.

'He has also been charged with causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent.

We all know the advice by now, but it might help to put some numbers on it. Well, apparently, you only need 149 items of clothing - across a whole lifetime. Even though more than 60% of householders report having unwanted clothes in their homes, according to ONS data, the average person in the UK spends an average of PS43.88 on clothes every month, adding up to PS526.50 per year. The sustainable clothing brand Rapanui has multiplied those figures by the current average length of adult life (63.2 years) to calculate that we each spend a whopping PS33,274.80 on clothes, when we would only need PS6,309.20's worth if we used them for their full lifespan.  That PS33,724.80 equates to a total of 786 pieces of clothing over a lifetime - 637 of which we don't need and ultimately go to waste, contributing to the 350,000 tonnes of wearable clothing that goes to landfill every year. And what's bad for the planet is also bad for our pockets - if we kept to a more sustainable capsule wardrobe of 'just' 149 items in our lives, we could save a staggering PS26,965.60. A big social media trend with 286.4 million views on TikTok and over 39,000 Google searches in 2022 alone, a 'capsule wardrobe' is a minimalist approach to building a small collection of fashion items that can be used to create several different outfits with carefully selected pieces that will forever stay in style. Here's how much money you could save by building one yourself, according to Rapanui. If we don't change our fast fashion spending habits fast, by 2050, fashion will take up a quarter of the world's carbon budget. So how can we ensure the clothes we do buy stay in good condition?  'Always follow the wash care label on the individual pieces of clothing to make sure that you're not causing any damage or shrinking items, making them unwearable,' Rheanna Coleman, supply chain lead at Rapanui says.  'Aside from specific steps we'd recommend a cool wash at 30degC and hang drying products to ensure longevity and reduce the environmental impact of the washing process.' As well the capsule wardrobe approach, Mart Drake-Knight, co-founder of sustainable merch platform Teemill, recommends buying from brands that embrace circular fashion. 'In a circular process products are designed from the start to be remade,' he explains. 'That means materials flow back to the maker and the new product is made from the old product. It is different from recycling, or upcycling, where the material is turned into something different before it is then thrown away.  'Circularity means designing products that are made to be remade, creating an option for fashion to be more sustainable for the planet than ever before.'

Rishi Sunak announced an emergency PS15billion worth of support to help the poorest households and provide energy discounts for all. He also performed a screeching U-turn by introducing a temporary windfall tax on oil and gas giants. The chancellor said the levy would raise around PS5 billion over the next year and include a 'new investment allowance' to incentivise the reinvestment of profits. Pensioners will also receive a one-off PS300 payment and there will be a one-off disability cost of living payment of PS150, as part of the package unveiled in the commons today.  The chancellor was forced to unveil the measures in a bid to tackle the impact of soaring inflation which has reached a 40-year high. He also said he knew people were 'worried' and 'struggling'. Sunak also announced he was now making the PS200 loan for energy bills a grant - that no longer needs to be paid back - and increased its sum to PS400. The 'rebate and clawback' scheme had been criticised for effectively being a loan because families would have to pay it back in the form of higher bills over the next five years.  The full package means that the eight million most vulnerable households would receive at least PS1,200 of support, including a PS150 council tax rebate which has already been announced. A further PS500 million will be allocated to the fund administered by councils to help households facing extra hardship. The move aims to help families with sky rocketing bills that are set to increase further to PS2,800 a year from October.  Sunak caved in to mounting pressure over a windfall tax, despite skepticism from fellow cabinet ministers.  Opposition parties had pushed for the one-off tax after BP and Shell both reported big increases in profits as oil and gas prices surge around the world. However, ministers spent months criticising the idea of a windfall tax because of its potential impact on investment. What Was Rishi Sunak's Announcement?  Windfall Tax Sunak announced an 'energy profits levy' to raise around PS5 billion in a year. The temporary one-off tax will hit oil and gas firms by 25 per cent on extraordinary profits, which surged because of the invasion of Ukraine and the covid-19 pandemic. An 80 per cent investment allowance was also announced in order to calm the nerves of Tory MPs that the move will dent North Sea firms' investment to save them 91p for every PS1 they spend. Bills Discount For All The chancellor acknowledged the situation has worsened since he announced the energy bills discount, which was effectively a PS200 loan. He doubled it to a PS400 discount on bills for all households from October, and has made it a grant that will not need to be paid back. Help For Low Income Households More than eight million of the lowest income households will receive a PS650 one-off payment. It will apply to households on universal credit, tax credits, pension credit and legacy benefits. Separate one-off payments of PS300 will go to pensioners and PS150 for those receiving disability benefits.  The chancellor said the government 'will provide significant support for the British people' and added: 'The oil and gas sector is making extraordinary profits not as the result of recent changes to risk taking or innovation or or efficiency as the result of surging global commodity prices driven in part by Russia's war. 'For that reason I am sympathetic to the argument to tax those profits fairly. It is possible to both tax extraordinary profits fairly and incentivise investment.' Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said it showed the Labour Party was winning 'the battle of ideas in Britain'. She told the commons: 'After today's announcement, let there be no doubt about who is winning the battle of ideas in Britain. It's the Labour Party. 'It feels like the chancellor has finally realised the problems the country are facing. We first called for a windfall tax on oil and gas producers nearly five months ago to help struggling families and pensioners. 'Today, he has announced that policy but he can't dare say the words: it's a policy that dare not speak its name with this chancellor. 'And it was Labour that first highlighted the unfairness of this government buy now, pay later compulsory loan scheme. It shouldn't have taken a rocket scientist to work out that this wouldn't cut and we pointed it out at the time.'  The timing of the announcement, the day after the publication of the damning Sue Gray report on partygate, prompted claims that ministers were trying to avoid further damaging headlines. But earlier today, the prime minister's chief of staff Stephen Barclay insisted the decision was in response to Ofgem's indication the energy price cap will rise by more than PS800 in October. Ofgem's chief executive Jonathan Brearley indicated this week that the energy price cap will increase to PS2,800 in October. Cabinet ministers who had previously expressed criticism of the idea included Jacob Rees-Mogg, Kwasi Kwarteng and Liz Truss.  Boris Johnson also previously said a windfall tax would 'deter investment', would be 'totally ridiculous' and would 'raise prices for consumers'.

The top civil servant's highly-anticipated probe into the Downing Street parties which took place throughout lockdown revealed some eyebrow-raising details about the culture in No.10. There was 'wine on the walls', mistreatment of cleaners and records of Downing Street staff texting: 'We seem to have got away with it'. Despite these damning new details, prime minister Boris Johnson apologised before claiming that the report 'vindicated' him. Now the probe is in the public domain, more Tory MPs are clearly starting to lose faith in Johnson and calling for him to resign. Meanwhile, just 24 hours after the Gray report came out, the government has suddenly announced that it will be doing more to ease the cost of living crisis - a crisis which started at the beginning of April. Sky News' Kay Burley subsequently asking about the 'timing' of these new helpful measures on Thursday morning when interviewing Johnson's ally, the Downing Street chief of staff Steve Barclay. He simply replied that 'we don't control the timing' of the Sue Gray report. He instead suggested the cost-cutting measures were pinned to energy regulator Ofgem's announcement from Monday that another increase to energy bills are ahead. He also said the Sue Gray probe was linked to the Met Police investigation, which concluded last Friday. As expected, not many people agreed with his explanation on Twitter. Some people were also furious at the idea that the government is keen for people to move on now that the report was out. Comic Rosie Holt tweeted: 'It's always been my understanding that one aspect of an apology is the perpetrators don't get to decide that part.' Meanwhile, ByLine TV commentator Mike Galsworthy shared a video claiming it was the 'prime minister, not us, who should move on', while the i's commentator Ian Dunt claimed it was 'demeaning' for a leader to produce such excuses for partygate.", "ff4289b8ae630a0654314fdc6b0edd61786942fde67f3ed1ec91473d": "Rishi Sunak has announced a PS15 billion package of help to tackle cost of living crisis, after being dragged 'kicking and screaming' into U-turning on his opposition to a windfall tax. It comes amid soaring inflation, with a new poll on Thursday showing one in five (22%) Britons now say they are struggling or unable to make ends meet. The chancellor had just last month said it would be 'silly' to announce more help this soon. This is what the chancellor has now announced:  1. Every household will be given a PS400 discount on their energy bills. This is double what the government had first proposed. Importantly the money will be a grant. Previously the money was just a loan, with everyone having to pay it back over time. 2. A one-off payment of PS650 will be given to households on means-tested benefits. The money will be paid directly into people's bank accounts in two lump sums - the first from July, the second in the autumn. 3. Pensioners on low income will be given PS300, paid in November/December alongside the Winter Fuel Payment. 4. There will be a a PS150 disability cost of living payment to people in receipt of extra cost disability benefits.  The package would mean that almost all of the eight million most vulnerable households would receive at least PS1,200 of support. This includes a PS150 council tax rebate which has already been announced. A further PS500 million will also be allocated to the fund administered by councils to help households facing extra hardship. To help pay for PS5bn of it, the chancellor announced a windfall tax on oil and gas firms - who have benefited from globally high prices driven by post-pandemic demand and the war in Ukraine. Sunak branded it a 'temporary targeted energy profits levy' rather than a windfall tax. Labour has long been demanding the government introduce a windfall tax to help people cope with rising energy bills.", "54e6384756cded7548ee6f46a212f4bd6773ceecda87c44ad38e8d69": "Given the cost of living crisis, the ongoing fallout from Brexit, and a state of politics that's bulldozing our lives, it's hard to feel grateful to the powers that be. So it's strange to see the words 'I want to thank the government' going viral on TikTok.  But don't worry. This isn't about fawning over politicians online. Instead, young people are improbably sharing and showing their support for a Trades Union Congress (TUC) advertisement - in their thousands. The clever clip satirises all we should be thankful for right now. Liker err, that PS200 the government said they'd loan people to help with bills and later realised wasn't enough (in the wake of the ongoing Partygate row, chancellor Rishi Sunak is set to make a u-turn on this today ). 'I want to thank the government for cutting PS20 of my universal credit,' says one of the smiling faces in the TUC clip with a comedically straight-face. 'Before I was able to eat AND heat my home, it's so much simpler now that I only have to do one.' Another adds, with a big grin: 'I want to thank the government for promising to bring in a tax cut... in two years time.' The campaign ad has been viewed more than 1.5 million times on its TikTok accounts and viewers are also duetting it by reacting in their own videos. The TUC has encouraged those who have viewed it and want to show their own 'gratitude' to join in giving thanks at a national march and rally next month. 'Working people have had enough. Everything's going up but our wages,' reads the call to action on the TUC website for the We Demand Better: March, that is meeting in London on Saturday June 18.  Naturally, the video has young people thanking the government for all the things they can no longer do. One person wrote: 'I'd love to come [to the rally] but the cost of the fuel prohibits... ironic really.' Another joked: 'I wish I could come but I can't afford the rail fare... I'd like to thank the government for that.' Others shared words of support.'I love this! When I heard the first line 'I want to thank the government' my eyes rolled so hard and I nearly scrolled, glad I didn't.' A spokesperson from the TUC told HuffPost UK: 'We are really pleased the video has struck a chord. Loads of viewers have pledged to join the demonstration after watching it. 'We need as many people as possible to march us with on Saturday June 18. Britain is facing a living standards emergency. It's really important that young people - and people of all ages - make their voices heard.'", "252db494d1b4c7e79ead0d3eae7a1ed4689b2199fb28d2672690d3bf": "Behold, the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations and a bumper four day weekend are almost upon us. And in classic fashion, food retailers are pulling out all the stops. Head to your local supermarket (or do any kind of online shopping) and you won't come up short on Union Jack bunting, Queen-inspired nicknacks, and other Royal paraphernalia.  While some of the offerings look rather tasty (hello, chocolate crown cake!), others are more than a little eyebrow-raising. We've even spotted a theme or two. Below, for your tasting please, we've rounded up some of the weirdest and most wonderful Jubilee grub on offer from supermarkets (and other food and beverage purveyors). 1) M&S Ham And Whole Egg Sandwich, PS4.25 in store Who doesn't want an entire egg in a sandwich? The Queen, probably. Awfully hard to eat in public, surely? This smoked British dry cure ham with egg mayonnaise and a whole soft poached egg is part of M&S's rather expansive Jubilee range. Be careful not to choke on that yolk, now! 2) M&S Caramel Corgi Mousse Cakes, PS6 from Ocado We know Her Maj loves corgis, so prepare to see a kennel's worth on this list. Naturally, M&S had to get in on the action with these salted caramel mousse cakes, topped with their cute little faces. No, don't ask us what a mousse cake is. We don't know either. 3) Tesco's Chocolate Biscuit Crown Cake (recipe) Yes, the centre of this cake looks like it tastes like any other, but the biscuit bits are Rich Tea - how very British! - and behold, the whole thing has a crown, with gold-coated white chocolate points. The only issue? You'll have to make it yourself. Tesco just give you the recipe and ingredients. Fancy, but fiddly. 4) Sainsbury's Union Jack Cupcakes, PS5 for 9 online / in store It's quite a feat that we've made it this far without much red, white and blue making an appearance. But Sainsbury's has baked up the inevitable batch of Union Jack cupcakes so you don't have to. Which is just as well as anyone trying to ice some at home is going to need some right Royal hand control. 5) Morrisons Corgi Cake, PS6 in store Told you there was going to be plenty of corgi fun. Morrisons has also thrown its hat (or dog collar) in the ring with this chocolate covered Swiss roll. FYI, the cake has been named 'Clarence' by customers, following a competition on Morrisons Facebook page. Is the whole thing a take on M&S's Jubilee Colin the Caterpillar (also a corgi)? Probably - but we've all been there before.  6) Tesco's Jubilee Lemonade Jelly (recipe)  Are brands capitalising on the moment and throwing the word Jubilee on any old pudding? Yes. Are we still going to eat the stuff? Also yes. Another DIY job from Tesco but we're told this layered lemonade and custard jelly lasts three days in the fridge once you've made it, so you can 'keep the party going.' 7) Asda PG Tips Jubilee Corgi Tea, PS3.80 for 240 bags No, this tea isn't actually made from Corgis. Phew! But this special edition box of your favourite cuppa is available in a range of stores while stocks last - if you can beat HRH's team to it. Because we'd hazard a guess this is one novelty Jubilee item to which the Queen herself is probably rather partial. 8) Japan Centre Union Jack Doughnuts, PS2.99 each in store Japan Centre, the Japanese food hall, is wonderfully celebrating the Platinum Jubilee with these Union Jack Mochi doughnuts, on sale until Sunday June 5 at all three branches in London (Leicester Square, Ichiba Westfield and Westfield Stratford City). They should probably get a town crier to shout about this one. 9) Beanies Jubilee Cake Coffee, PS2.75 per jar Beanies the coffee seller is offering a limited edition Jubilee Cake flavour coffee - a heady combo of strawberry jam, sweet vanilla sponge and cream filling. Sweet. We've not been able to try it yet, but please report back to us if you do. 10) Honeywell Bakes Corgi and Crown Biscuits, PS25 a set Wow! There's biscuits and there's biscuits! And we have to take our crown off to the folks at Honeywell Bakes, who have launched two new Jubilee-themed ones: a Corgi set (below) and this edible headpiece (above), which can be personalised for a queenly sum. Get your orders in quickly or you'll miss out. 11) Drinks Supermarket Jubilee Colour-Changing Gin, PS27.99 You'll need something to wash all these treats down with and, naturally, there are plenty of boozy offerings available. If you fancy this colour-changing spirit (with Union Jack label, of course), you'll want to be quick as it's limited edition. It's sure to impress guests and it's what the Queen Mum would have wanted. 12) Aldi's Jubilee Soft Toy Queen, PS3.99 in store Okay, so you can't eat this one, but we couldn't finish this list off without a shout out to Aldi's iconic Kevin the Carrot, dressed up in drag as the Queen!! Snap her up solo, or you can get Queenie, Charles and two corgis for just PS15.95.", "5c8b49977f43f750a869f2b7f70758faf8298175e5dedc7651927029": "Wine time Fridays in Downing Street have been banned, after it was revealed lockdown breaking parties were held in which staff 'drank excessively'. Members of the No.10 press office brought in wine on Fridays to mark the end of the week - an event known as 'wine time Friday' or WTF for short. Bottles of wine would be placed on a table in a small room adjacent to the main press office and people could help themselves. WTF took place both before and during the Covid pandemic.  Sue Gray's report into partygate detailed how gatherings during lockdown led to red wine being spilled on walls, someone being sick and a fight taking place. Asked on Thursday if wine time Friday was now banned, Boris Johnson's spokesperson said: 'In effect, Yes.' They said this was because alcohol consumption for staff in No.10 was now 'not permitted' outside of formal events, such as those held for visiting world leaders. The new rules were brought in after Gray issued her interim report in January, No.10 said. Earlier, Downing Street's chief of staff said the prime minister had made a 'significant change' to No.10 by shaking up his team and apologising for the lockdown-busting events. Steve Barclay said he and Johnson were both 'shocked' and 'appalled' by the Gray report's findings after it was issued on Wednesday. Two more Conservatives, John Baron, the MP for Basildon and Billericay, and David Simmonds, the MP for Ruislip, this morning called on Johnson to resign.", "b6f01638c79b413e1cada3876485bdf6a01be848d72b4af6bc2724b6": "Marcus Rashford has announced that he and his long-time girlfriend Lucia Loi are engaged. The pair have been in a relationship since they were teenagers after meeting in high school, and shared their exciting news in a joint Instagram post on Wednesday night. According to The Sun, Marcus and Lucia got engaged during a holiday to California, with their announcement being accompanied by a romantic photo-shoot showing them kissing in front of a heart-shaped floral display. He also captioned the photo with the date of their engagement. Many of the England forward's teammates were quick to congratulate the couple, including Ro-Shaun Williams, Callum Wilson and James Garner, while the official Manchester United account commented: 'So happy for you both!' Although they were rumoured to have briefly split last year, Marcus confirmed things were back on in January, when he posted a collage of photos of himself and Lucia alongside the message: 'Through thick and thin.' Although best known as one of the most prolific footballers in the UK, Marcus has also made a name for himself in recent years for his charity work and campaigning, helping young people affected by food poverty. Last year, he was awarded an MBE for his campaign work to support vulnerable children. More recently, Marcus' book You Are A Champion - intended to help young readers 'be the best you can be' - was named Book Of The Year at the British Book Awards.

John Baron, the MP for Basildon and Billericay, and David Simmonds, the MP for Ruislip, have joined calls for the prime minister to step down. In a statement on Thursday morning, Baron blasted the 'shameful pattern of misbehaviour' in Downing Street during lockdown. He accused Johnson of misleading parliament by claiming he was not aware of rule breaking on his watch, branding his denials 'not credible'. Simmonds said while the government and its policies 'enjoy the confidence of the public', the prime minister 'does not'. 'It is time for him to step down so that new leadership can take forward the important work of the government in ensuring that our people and country prosper,' he said. Three Tory MPs have now called for Johnson to go in the wake of the Sue Gray report into partygate, which was published on Wednesday morning. Julian Sturdy, the MP for York Outer, yesterday also said the PM should resign. Gray detailed a culture of 'excessive drinking' in No.10, with wine being spilled up the walls, fights and people being sick. The Downing Street cleaners and security guards, Gray found, were also treated with a 'lack of respect' by staff. Johnson has said he 'overwhelmingly' believes he should remain in office and has rejected calls for him to quit. It takes 54 Tory MPs to force a no confidence vote in Johnson in order to remove him as leader. So far fewer than 20 have publicly demanded he quit, however the number who have secretly formally submitted a letter of no confidence could be higher.  Baron said: 'The Sue Gray report and the Metropolitan Police investigations paint a shameful pattern of misbehaviour during the pandemic as the rest of us kept to the Covid regulations. 'Those responsible for setting the rules have a special duty to adhere to them. 'However, for me the most serious charge against the prime minister is that of knowingly misleading parliament. 'Given the scale of rule-breaking in No 10, I can not accept that the prime minister was unaware. Therefore, his repeated assurances in parliament that there was no rule-breaking is simply not credible. He added: 'Parliament is the beating heart of our nation. To knowingly mislead it can not be tolerated, no matter the issue. 'Whether or not the prime minister is an asset to the party or the country is of less importance. 'Having always said I would consider all the available evidence before deciding, I'm afraid the prime minister no longer enjoys my support - I can no longer give him the benefit of the doubt.'", "6063c83a82da45f65e2987db144d5e13811f674dbe2bf8c38c0289db": "The chancellor is expected to reveal a windfall tax on Thursday in a bid to ease the cost of living crisis, even though the Tories have been shouting down the proposal for weeks. The one-off levy is likely to fund a new support package and help households facing a huge squeeze on the finances due to inflation, increasing energy bills and higher national insurance tax. Oil and gas producers have seen their profit margins grow due to the soaring global energy prices prompted by the war in Ukraine. The tax on these finances may make more than PS7 billion in profit, according to some estimates. Some reports suggest Sunak will now cut energy bills by PS400 through the windfall tax, but the government has not exactly been enthusiastic about the suggestion from the get-go. Here's a breakdown of all the times Tory ministers dismissed the idea. Boris Johnson: 'Not for this government' When pressed in PMQs by Keir Starmer about the windfall tax only last week, the prime minister said: 'This government is not in principle in favour of higher taxation.' Claiming that this was more of a Labour pursuit than a Conservative one, Johnson continued: 'What we want to do is take a sensible approach governed by impact on investment and jobs.'  It's worth noting that the government did actually increase national insurance tax only in April. Boris Johnson: 'Not the right thing' The prime minister also told LBC two weeks ago that a windfall tax would reduce investment from oil and gas companies. 'The disadvantage with those sorts of taxes is that they deter investment in the very things that they need to be investing in - new technology, in new energy supply.' He did not rule it out completely, but added: 'I didn't think they're the right thing. I don't think they're the right way forward. I want those companies to make big, big investments.'  Boris Johnson: Oil and gas companies 'don't want a windfall tax' At the beginning of the month, the prime minister said these large firms 'don't want a windfall tax', claiming: 'That is because it would stop investment in new technology and new green power that we need.' This claim came after the boss of BP suggested his company would still want to invest even if it had to pay a windfall tax. Rishi Sunak: Not 'naturally attracted' to this idea Speaking to the BBC, Sunak said: 'I'm not naturally attracted to the idea of windfall taxes in general.' However, he conceded that he was still on the fence about the idea, explaining: 'These companies are making a significant amount of profit at the moment because of these very elevated prices. 'What I want to see is significant investment back in the UK economy to support jobs, to support energy security and I want to see that soon. 'If that doesn't happen then no options are off the table.' Sajid Javid: 'I don't like it' The health secretary told the Welsh Conservative conference over the weekend that it went against his political beliefs to back such a tax. He said: 'Instinctively I don't like it. I just think we've got to be really careful. 'As a country, we have a very hard-won but strong reputation on being pro-business, welcoming investment.' He added that a windfall tax 'could have an impact in the long-term that we would come to regret'. Liz Truss: 'There's a cost in imposing such a tax' The foreign secretary did acknowledge that the UK was in a 'very, very difficult economic situation' at the moment, but claimed the government should be cutting taxes rather than introducing one on energy companies. She told Sky News: 'The problem with a windfall tax is it makes it difficult to attract future investment into our country, so there is a cost in imposing a tax like that.' Kwasi Kwarteng: 'Never been a supporter' Kwarteng told the BBC's Sunday Morning Show on May 15 that he was firmly opposed to the tax. The business secretary went on to tell Sky News: 'I've never been a supporter of windfall taxes. 'I have been very clear on that publicly, I think it discourages investment and the reason why we want to have investment is because it creates jobs, it creates wealth and it also gives us energy security.' Brandon Lewis: 'Doesn't work' The Northern Ireland secretary claimed that the proposal 'sounds attractive but doesn't work'. He said to The Daily Telegraph: 'It puts off investment both in that sector and, absolutely, the risk in others.' He added that ministers were 'all very right to be wary of windfall taxes', explaining: 'I'm a Conservative, I believe in a low tax economy. We want to see as much money in people's pockets as we possibly can and businesses investing in high productivity and high skilled high paid jobs.' He accused Labour of prioritising 'a few headlines' over supporting business' in the opposition party's bid to champion a windfall tax. Suella Braverman: 'Not a great idea' The attorney general told Conservative Home last week that she did not back the proposal. 'I don't think a windfall tax would be a great idea, if I'm honest. I think that we want to incentivise investment. Profits are not an enemy of Conservatives. Profits mean more investment. Profits mean more research. Profits mean more jobs.' Dominic Raab: 'Frankly ill thought through' The justice secretary and deputy prime minister told Sky News at the end of April: 'If you look at Labour's policy of a windfall tax, that would damage investment in energy supplies we need and hike bills. It's disastrous. It's not serious.' Jacob Rees-Mogg: 'Retrospective taxation is difficult' The Brexit opportunities minister explained his opposition to the proposal last week: 'I'm merely saying there is this honey pot of business you can just raid whenever you feel like is not true.' 'Retrospective taxation is difficult because you are changing the understanding of what people do when they invest.' He told reporters: 'I think the idea of a windfall tax as a panacea to the inflation problem is wrong.' So why are the Tories introducing it again? Inflation has reached a 40-year high at 9%, although the poorest households are experiencing an average inflation rate even higher at 10.9%. Millions of UK adults have admitted to skipping at least one meal a day to cut costs, while the UK economy as a whole is lagging behind the rest of the G7 in the wake of pandemic recovery.", "fb652e693e125218aa5e3a7ef931c6c8f0c32fa1fe0ee63006457bd8": "France's Le Monde newspaper described the United States as a country 'trapped in madness' after yet another mass shooting at a school claimed the lives of 19 children and two teachers in Texas earlier this week.  The newspaper called it a cycle of despair that keeps repeating.  'The one in Parkland, in 2018, changed nothing despite the exceptional activism of students who had escaped. They believed it was possible to bring a country sick of its violence back to its senses and remind elected officials of their responsibilities,' the newspaper wrote. 'But they failed.'  Then, Le Monde turned the concept of 'American exceptionalism' -- the notion that there is something special and unique about the United States -- upside down.  'If there is any American exceptionalism, it is to tolerate the fact that schools in the United States are regularly transformed into bloody shooting ranges,' the newspaper wrote.  Le Monde placed the blame on the GOP: 'Indeed, America is killing itself and the Republican Party is looking the other way, ideologically complicit in one tragedy after another.'

And now, some scientists have suggested there may be an indirect link to Covid.  Monkeypox has been identified in England and Scotland, but as of May 24, no cases have been identified in Wales or Northern Ireland. Other cases have been found in 19 countries including the UAE, Spain, Portugal, the US and Australia, the World Health Organisation said. Monkeypox is a DNA viral illness that causes fever and a distinctive, bumpy rash. In some cases it can also cause headaches, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes and fatigue. The disease has been around for decades and the name comes from when it was first identified during an outbreak in monkeys in 1958. Now, experts from London Medical Laboratory have said that Covid-19 may have 'paved the way' for the outbreak and that widespread PCR testing for the disease would present significant new challenges.  'Though typically spread by contact with an infected animal, person-to-person cases are now being recorded in the UK,' Dr Quinton Fivelman, chief scientific officer at London Medical Laboratory, said. 'The virus is likely spread by touching or sharing infected items like clothing and bedding, or by the respiratory droplets produced by sneezing or coughing,'  While monkeypox and Covid are entirely unrelated viruses medically, it is possible that Covid coincidentally created an environment fit for the global surge in monkeypox cases. That's due to two factors. Firstly, Covid-19 may have left some people with weakened immune systems. 'New research from scientists in Cambridge indicates that some Covid patients show profound alterations in many immune cell types that persist for weeks or even months after Covid infection,' Dr Fivelman said. 'This could lead to people with weakened immune systems being more susceptible to diseases such as monkeypox.'  Secondly, there is some evidence that many of us, even those who have never caught Covid, have less resistance to viruses because we have been out less and interacted less with other people during the pandemic.  'We've all been masked-up and had less exercise and exposure to the protection offered by sunshine's vitamin D. Certainly for children, this lack of exposure to new viruses won't have helped build robust immune systems,' said Dr Fivelman. Another way the pandemic may be influencing the spread of monkeypox is through international travel. For many months, this was at a virtual standstill during the pandemic. 'Now it is once again largely unrestricted, families and friends from across continents are reuniting all at once,' said Dr Fivelman. 'That presents a great opportunity for any opportunistic virus to spread.' But remember, monkeypox is not like Covid The good news is that, unlike the Covid-19 virus, the monkeypox virus is made of double-stranded DNA, which means that it is larger and heavier and unable to travel in the air as far as the tiny, single-stranded Covid RNA virus. Once the rash forms a scab, in two to four weeks, people are no longer infectious. And most people will recover without any longterm implications.  Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, emphasised remembering these differences.  'The monkeypox outbreak continues to escalate, and is undoubtedly worrying. The extent of the community transmission of monkeypox, being observed here in the UK and now in several other countries around the world, is concerning,' he said.  'However, it is important to highlight that whilst it is understandable to compare monkeypox with Covid-19, it's important to remember they are two different viruses with their own characteristics. A big monkeypox outbreak like this is still a very different situation to a Covid-19 pandemic.' There is also no evidence of monkeypox being linked to Covid-19 vaccines, as some on social media have falsely claimed.

Every series, viewers are left squirming on their sofas during the stomach-churning trials, which see the Islanders passing food between one another's mouths in a bid to win a reward from producers. For example, last year's task saw the couples aiming to recreate a roast dinner by spitting ingredients like gravy and vegetables into each other's open mouths. Gross, right? Well, Love Island devotees can breathe a sigh of relief as it sounds like the much-derided tasks will be ditched in the upcoming series. During a Reddit Q&A on Wednesday, executive producer Mike Spencer was urged: 'Please can you stop making people spit food into each others mouths.' He then responded: 'We are stepping away from the food challenges as we know them.' Mike was also asked about the balance between looking after contestants' wellbeing and 'production choices' that are 'clearly aimed to create emotional distress', with particular emphasis being put on the Casa Amor postcards sent every year, which have sparked Ofcom complaints in the past. 'We have published our duty of care protocols very publicly and we have an incredible welfare team on the series,' Mike wrote back. 'I agree we have to be incredibly considered when making editorial choices. 'We are also making a dating entertainment series but humour is normally at the heart of most storylines. I think we are considered and it always becomes tricky with the passing of information but we aim to find balance in the show.' It's not just the ditching of the 'food challenges' that will be different this year, though. Love Island is moving to a brand new Mallorcan villa for its upcoming eighth series, which launches on Monday 6 June at 9pm on ITV.

SuperNature opens with Gervais telling the audience that his jokes are intended to be 'ironic'. He then goes on to refer to cisgender women as 'old-fashioned women... the ones with wombs, those fucking dinosaurs', before making disparaging comments about trans women. The set then includes an imagined conversation between a cis woman objecting to sharing a toilet with trans women, including a joke about rape. During an appearance on The One Show, the comic defended making jokes about 'taboo subjects'. 'I think that's what comedy is for, really - to get us through stuff, and I deal in taboo subjects because I want to take the audience to a place it hasn't been before, even for a split second,' he said. 'Most offence comes from when people mistake the subject of a joke with the actual target.' He continued: 'It starts and they go, what's he going to say? I tell the joke. Phew, they laugh. 'It's like a parachute jump - it's scary, but then you land and it's all OK. 'I think that's what comedy is for - getting us over taboo subjects so they're not scary any more. So I deal with everything. And I think we second guess the audience too much.' However, US LGBT rights group Glaad labelled the show 'dangerous', 'anti-gay' and 'anti trans' after its release on Tuesday. 'We watched the Ricky Gervais 'comedy' special on Netflix so you don't have to,' they said. 'It's full of graphic, dangerous, anti-trans rants masquerading as jokes. He also spouts anti-gay rhetoric and spreads inaccurate information about HIV. 'Netflix has a policy that content 'designed to incite hate or violence' is not allowed on their platform, but we all know that anti-LGBTQ content does exactly that. While Netflix is home to some groundbreaking LGBTQ shows, it refuses to enforce its own policy in comedy. 'The LGBTQ community and our allies have made it very clear that so-called comedians who spew hate in place of humor, and the media companies who give them a platform, will be held accountable. Meanwhile, there are PLENTY of funny LGBTQ comedians to support.' Gervais' remarks have also been heavily criticised on social media, including by many comedians on Twitter. Many also took the opportunity to repost an old set from British comic James Acaster, lampooning established comedians for taking aim at the trans community. Netflix previously came under fire over comments featured in Dave Chappelle's stand-up special towards the end of last year. During his show The Closer, he argued that 'gender is a fact' and said he was 'team TERF', an acronym for trans-exclutionary radical feminist. HuffPost UK has contacted representatives for Ricky Gervais and Netflix for comment.", "92155186d9ec31894fe39cd596e61d36c6b18fe6c1aaa55408685386": "Boris Johnson's chief of staff has insisted the prime minister had a 'duty' to attend staff leaving parties during the pandemic -- even when people were unable to say goodbye to dying relatives. The PM repeatedly stood by his decision to thank departing staff in person following the publication of Sue Gray's damning report into the partygate scandal that has rocked No.10. The report contained salacious details of excessive drinking and socialising inside No.10, where staff drank until they were sick and red wine was spilled up the walls. In her report, the senior civil servant noted how Johnson attended a series of events himself, including a now infamous gathering for his departing director of communications Lee Cain where he is pictured raising a glass of alcohol.  But speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, the prime minister insisted he felt it was his 'duty' to make an appearance at the leaving-dos of departing colleagues.  'When I was speaking to colleagues about the departure of another spad [special adviser], or government adviser or official, it didn't occur to me that this was anything except what it was my duty to do as prime minister during a pandemic. 'That's why I did it, and that's why I spoke as I did in the House of Commons. And, yes, as Sue has found and everybody can see and the evidence has shown, after I had been there things did not go well.' Johnson's words were immediately seized on by Sky Presenter Kay Burley, who asked Barclay: 'So he could say goodbye to a work colleague, but people watching this programme this morning couldn't say goodbye to a dying relative?' Barclay replied: 'I know from my own families in the constituency that that was heartbreaking for people that weren't able to say goodbye, I think it was probably one of the worst features of the pandemic that people didn't get that moment of being able to say goodbye. 'I think as was covered at the time in the rules, people working in Downing Street, because of the nature of their jobs working for the prime minister, they're working in our vaccine rollout, ensuring we have the PPE, working very long hours in tight-knit situations, and there was a work exemption for them to be able to work together. 'It was in that context that the prime minster was very briefly, usually for a matter of minutes, to meet people.' Burley interjected: 'Why would he feel that he could say goodbye to a work colleague but people couldn't go to a graveside?' 'Because they were already in the building,' Barclay said. 'They were already working in tiny groups, they were already there.' 'Six bottles of wine, two bottles of champagne and a bottle of gin on the table...what sort of workplace is that?' Barclay replied: 'The Met has looked at these issues, these were very brief periods of time, the nature of the prime minster's job is to go from meeting to meeting to meeting. 'But at the same time he has recognised the need for changes, he's made those changes, and Sue Gray herself has recognised there's been significant change with a permanent secretary, with a change of leadership team as a result of the lessons we've learned.'", "1520e502d8f5fb12ed218ef3ca70d4a797cb5c0867d4f53fcfdbd148": "Edging upon Jared Leto levels of method acting, Austin Butler lived as Elvis Presley for nearly three years to transform into the hip-swiveling king of rock and roll for Baz Luhrmann's upcoming biopic. While the former might unwind at a silent 12-day desert meditation retreat, Butler had a bit more trouble de-transforming from the role after production wrapped, resulting in an unforeseen medical emergency. 'The next day I woke up at four in the morning with excruciating pain, and I was rushed to hospital,' the actor told GQ in a profile published on Wednesday. 'My body just started shutting down the day after I finished Elvis.' Butler ultimately recovered, but was diagnosed with a 'virus that simulates appendicitis and spent a week bedridden,' per the outlet.  The film chronicles the legendary performer's relationship with his manager Colonel Tom Parker, played by Tom Hanks. To portray Presley, Butler worked with a movement coach, covered his apartment walls with photos and memorabilia and adopted a Southern twang, which he somewhat confusingly still speaks in, despite his Anaheim, California upbringing.  The actor beat out a slew of high-profile talent, including Ansel Elgort, Miles Teller and Harry Styles for the role after sending in a passionate video of himself performing Unchained Melody, which Luhrmann remarked looked like he was 'having a breakdown.' 'You can lose touch with who you actually are,' Butler said of his extensive preparation. 'And I definitely had that when I finished 'Elvis' - not knowing who I was.'  He even made a trip to Graceland to spend time with the singer's ex-wife Priscilla Presley. She has lent her support to the film, which she said was 'told brilliantly and creatively,' praising the actor's portrayal as 'outstanding.' 'She looked like an angel,' Butler recalled about their meeting. 'I walked down the hall with Baz afterwards with tears in my eyes.' The two apparently formed quite the friendship, posing together on the red carpet at the 2022 Met Gala earlier this month.  But it was Hanks who ultimately helped ground Butler back in reality after encouraging the 30-year-old star to 'read something that has nothing to do' with the job at hand.  'That gave me permission, because up 'til that point, I was only reading everything to do with Elvis,' Butler said. 'I was only listening to Elvis. It was Elvis's influences and Elvis himself and nothing else.' Elvis arrives in cinemas on 24 June.", "d50745e51328d320017b863dba8c5c74faa016f3d06f59578b7ba3ee": "It is an unfortunately universal career truth that you will be given work that you do not want to do.  Sometimes, it's tedious tasks you simply have to complete to get through a project. But when you're given a task outside your job description or busywork that truly doesn't matter, it may be time to set a boundary. So, how do you tactfully say, 'I don't have time for this?'  It takes real skill to set a boundary and gracefully decline, especially when an assignment is coming from your boss or a crucial higher-up. But it's worse to stay silent, overwhelm yourself with responsibilities and burn yourself out.  'If you don't say anything, no one is going to think anything is wrong,' says Lawrese Brown, the founder of C-Track Training, a workplace education company.  Here's what you need to consider when you push back against a peer's or boss's request:  First, recognise when you need to push back Sometimes, when a superior asks 'Can you do this?' we hear, 'You must do this.' But if your boss is reasonable, there's usually room to offer feedback.  Learning how to align their priorities with your own is a part of managing up; you ultimately know how you work best. And sometimes, your boss may not realise that the way they word their request for 'end of day' could have you pulling an all-nighter. Career coach Jasmine Escalera said that early in her career, she used to say 'yes' to anything that her boss asked. 'I thought that that was what I supposed to do in order to grow within my career,' she says. But she later recognised that by saying yes to everything, she was just categorising herself as 'someone who would just do a lot of work.'  Brown says one other common scenario professionals run into is being asked to do tasks that do not align with their personal goals. They may have the time to do them, but not the will. This is one of the trickiest concerns to bring up - especially when you and your co-workers know these are not helpful to the team, but your leadership doesn't realise it.  If you do decide to push back on tasks that fall into this category, focus on how it is causing the team to be inefficient. Brown gives the example of an employee feedback form that people are told to fill out when they have a complaint, even though the form itself doesn't prompt any action. In this case, she said, you could ask, 'Is this the best way for us to be capturing employee grievances? I've noticed that even when people write in the form, they are going to have to bring it up to a manager, too.'  Telling a colleague 'I don't have time for this' is easier. Just try this Because you don't report directly to your peers, it's generally easier to set polite boundaries with them than it is to do it with your manager. When you know you don't have time for a task a colleague is asking you to do, you can simply directly say, 'I'm sorry, I'm unable to help you with this right now,' and negotiate to complete the request at a later time or with a different scope, or refer them to a different colleague who could help, says Mary Abbajay, president of the leadership development consultancy Careerstone Group.  'The idea is to be gracious and helpful without saying 'yes' if you don't have time to do it,' Abbajay says. 'The worst you can do is say 'yes' to something you don't have time for and then that adds stress to your plate, and will probably make what you are trying to get done late.' Saying 'no' to your boss goes better when you have a solution in mind. Brown finds the biggest mistake people make when being overwhelmed with assignments from their bosses is simply saying 'I don't have time for this' and not having a solution in mind. 'Don't just stop at the identification of it, because then you'll come off as complaining, even when the complaint or grievance is valid,' she says. Keep in mind that the way you talk to a boss is going to be different than how you speak to a peer because of the power dynamic. Brown says the tone for a peer can be more informal, with language like 'Hey, let's work on this together!' But with a manager, you may need to couch your request in a question, such as 'Can we meet so that you can give information on how I can best prioritise?' When talking to your boss, it helps to immediately acknowledge their decision-making authority and offer to adjust your priorities, says organisational psychologist Laura Gallaher of the consulting firm Gallaher Edge. For example, you could say 'If I help you with that now, then I'll complete this task/project [at this later date] - will that work for you?' she says.  Recognise that your boss may have their own busy demands to attend to and may have no idea that their latest request is actually your breaking point. To present your case for what really deserves your attention, track how long it takes you to do certain tasks over a week or two.  That way, when you ask your boss if it's possible to redirect your responsibilities elsewhere, you have data to back you up about how certain tasks are clogging up your schedule, Escalera suggests.  This is something she's tried herself. 'I remember having this conversation with a supervisor of mine where I presented my task items and my time and my allotment, and he actually was like, 'Oh, well, these things are not even in your job description. You should be delegating this,'' Escalera says. 'He had no idea or knowledge of what I was doing on a day-to-day basis.'  When there is a disagreement between you and your boss about what you should tackle, Gallaher says you could try saying something like, 'I have a different understanding of what my priority is - if we're not in alignment, perhaps we can go to leadership together to get clarity. I definitely want to support the company's highest priority.'  But at a certain point, if you are finding that your leadership is making you continuously unable to prioritise tasks that really matter to your goals, Escalera said that this could be a sign to start looking for a job elsewhere.  'If no one is really there to support or guide you, and the work is just too massive and too much, it might be a moment for you to ask yourself: 'Is this really the company or organisation I need to be in right now? Is this a place where I can truly thrive?''", "424c4df891457a190263c4ba5eddd50333e155dde7a1d0f3cfc7db41": "You're reading Love Stuck, where trained therapists answer your dating, sex and relationship dilemmas. You can submit a question here. It's easy to lose your sense of self when you're in a long-term relationship. When you've been with someone for months or years, you start to see yourself in that person and vice versa. Your lives enmesh, whether you're living together or not, and you're likely to share friends, interests and values - as well as a bed. So when you break up with that person it can feel like a shock to the system in all kinds of ways. Who am I without the person I've been with for so long? This is the dilemma for this week's reader, Mandy. 'I have recently come out of an eight-year-long relationship, and am feeling emotionally all over the place,' Mandy tells HuffPost UK. 'I'm lost about how to regain my sense of self now that I'm no longer part of a couple. Part of me wants to date again, but I don't know how to tell if it's coming from the right place. How can I know when I'm ready? And are there any ways to make a break-up less painful?' Counselling Directory member Kimberly Tomlinson is on hand to help Mandy with this tricky but all-too-common situation. How can you regain a sense of self after a break-up? 'Often, a relationship can cause us to lose ourselves in our partners and depending on the length of time you've been with that person, you might not know who you are outside of them, but you are an individual,' Tomlinson says. So ask yourself: what do you enjoy doing in a day, week, month, year? ''You've always had your own likes, dislikes, hobbies, and interests so it's about exploring, rediscovering, and reminding yourself of the things YOU enjoyed.' Tomlinson expands on this: 'Even if there were shared interests or new interests discovered in the relationship, who says you can't do it by yourself or with a friend? Remind yourself you were whole before and will continue to be after. Lean into the things that make you feel good and are simply for your benefit,'  How can you emotionally detach ourselves from a past relationship or ex? Tomlinson believes the first step to emotionally detaching is 'being honest with ourselves about how we feel about a past relationship / ex-partner - with the emphasis on honesty.' Ask yourself how you actually feel. 'Not how you think you should feel because of the length of time you've been broken up or because your friends or family now have a negative perception of this person,' she says. 'Explore how you feel about them, the emotional hold they may have on you and the emotional needs they / the relationship fulfilled.' The next step, Tomlinson says, 'is to go about finding new ways to meet these needs and the detachment will slowly take place.' When do we know when it's time to start dating again? The starting point here is figuring out your current needs, says Tomlinson. 'Are you dating for fun, intimacy, to feel desired? Is it because you're ready for a new person in your life or because you're tired of crying over the old one. Knowing your reason may help you gauge for yourself if you're ready because only you know the importance you put on dating or finding a partner.' It's about listening to you gut, she says: 'The most important things is that it's your decision and if you do start dating, but you don't feel like it's the right time for you, trust that feeling and take a break. You can always try again later.'", "7c5e2b8ff38f6095be4963fab86e7995776a137c7de1cfdb9fa4ba09": "You're reading Move, the nudge we need to get active, however makes us happiest and healthiest. The latest exercise craze on TikTok doesn't require any exorbitantly priced equipment, but it does require a healthy dose of self-confidence.  This spring, seemingly everyone on the app - or at least the youths - has been talking about 'Hot Girl Walks.'  Coined by Mia Lind while taking her daily stroll around the neighbourhood during the pandemic, taking a Hot Girl Walk is as much about fitness as it is about cultivating a stronger sense of self-esteem.  'In lockdown, I was looking for a type of exercise that I didn't dread to do and realised the meditative element that comes with going on a long walk,' Lind, an undergrad communications major at the University of Southern California, told HuffPost.  'I also felt that walking had a strong stigma as not being a valid form of exercise so I gave 'walking' some rebranding as a Hot Girl Walk,' she says.  In her viral TikTok video, the 22-year-old outlines the three basic tenets of the Hot Girl Walk. On your walk, you should primarily think about three things:    What you're grateful for   How hot you are (naturally, it's not called a Hot Girl Walk for nothing)   Your goals and the steps you need to take to achieve them   The idea is to get your daily exercise in while ruminating on all you've accomplished, all you're teeing yourself up to accomplish, and, yes, how hot you are.  If negative thoughts crop up during your walk, Lind suggests queuing up a playlist with tracks that are Hot Girl Walk-minded and focusing on the lyrics. (Think: Beyonce's Coachella set or something anthem-y like Rebel Girl by Bikini Kill.) In her TikTok video, Lind does mention that she lost some weight by taking her extended walks - for her, each walk is about four miles - but she stresses that weight loss is not the intended goal of the Hot Girl Walk. 'There are several health benefits I could reference of walking, weight loss included, but the mental benefits and self-care aspect is the biggest change, or growth I have seen from the HGW,' she tells HuffPost.  Moving your body in any way, including walking, is a research-backed way to release endorphins, a set of feel-good chemicals that dull pain receptors in the brain, reduce stress and leave you with a euphoric feeling.  Even just a short 30-minute walk is enough to boost the mood of someone suffering from major depressive disorder, according to a 2005 study published in the journal of the American College of Sports Medicine. It's a great midday jolt to your creativity, too. Research from Stanford University has shown that creativity gets a boost while walking and shortly afterward. (Even better if you can take your walk in a nature preserve or in a quiet, tree-lined spot; researchers have also found that walking around in nature can lift your mood and help you stop dwelling on negative thoughts.) 'Not only has walking been shown to reduce depression symptoms and increase your creativity, but taking time for yourself to practice gratitude is the ultimate form of self-care and self-love,' says Vanessa Liu, an online Fitness trainer and nutritionist and a fan of the Hot Girl Walk. 'I love [Lind's] advice in another video that you can 'take that energy and carry it with you through the whole day,'' Liu said. 'It's a good reminder to take control of your life and can choose to live your best life despite your circumstances.'  Outside the mental reset, there's obvious physical perks, too. Though walking isn't as high-intensity as running, a 2013 study found that walkers who put in the same mileage as runners still get comparable reductions in high blood pressure, high cholesterol and coronary heart disease. (Yes, it may take a little longer to cover the same distance if you're walking, but walking has less impact on the knees, hips and lower back, which may lead to greater adherence to actually exercising.) If you're looking to get your Hot Girl Walk on, below fitness experts and mental health professionals who specialise in body image share how to get the most out of your walks.  Mind your posture Walk like the hot person you know you are by making sure your posture is just-so: Chest upright, with your head held high, looking forward into the distance. You may want to slightly bend your elbows while swinging your arms.  'Stand tall while walking and pack your shoulders back and down; you're aligning your mental world optimally so align your skeleton as well,' says Bianca Russo, a certified personal trainer and a body acceptance advocate. Improved posture will reduce potential aches and pains during and after the walk, Russo says. 'Remember that making even minor changes in how you hold yourself up may feel awkward or tiring at first, but in time these adjustments are investments for your longevity,' she explains. Walk without a time or distance requirement Lind walks two miles to her destination and two miles back, but tailor your walk to you and what is capable for your body on any one day, says Julia Parzyck, an disorder recovery coach and a body-acceptance influencer. 'If four miles at a certain pace doesn't feel good for your body, don't do it,' she says. 'Your body knows best and even if it's a five-minute walk around the block or just standing outside for some fresh air, that is enough.' Ditch the 'hot' part, if that feels better to you Parzyck goes on multiple walks weekly and while she agrees that walking is wonderful for your mental health, she doesn't love the 'Hot Girl' aspect of this trend. 'It doesn't feel inclusive and it's not accessible to everyone,' she says. 'Not everyone has the ability to get outdoors and go for walks, and if you don't have that ability, it doesn't mean you're not hot.' Jess Sprengle, a licensed professional therapist who specializes in treating eating disorders, also feels a little uncomfortable about the 'hot' part of the packaging. 'I like the idea of targeted thoughts while engaging in health-promoting activity, but it's hard to know if this is actually health-promoting activity or just ... diet culture-promoting activity with a sprinkle of toxic positivity thrown in, especially given the before and after pic in the TikTok video,' she says. Lind does stress that the goal is not weight loss. That said, Sprengle is right to point out that TikTok in general has a problem with body positive content. Put on music that moves you, not a podcast In her TikTok videos, Lind challenges people to walk without their earbuds. If you do want some background noise, she encourages you to listen to mood-boosting music rather than something more distracting like a podcast. (Megan Thee Stallion is going to get you moving more than the dulcet tones of Michael Barbaro on 'The Daily.' Sorry to that man.) Liu thinks music is preferable, too. 'People have a tendency to synchronise their movements with music,' she says. 'Think about how your toe starts tapping or your head starts bobbing when you hear a catchy beat.' Listening to music helps you keep up the pace of your walk, the trainer says, plus, 'a playlist with feel-good music can be inspiring and help you articulate or crystallise your goals and what you're grateful for and how hot you are.' Incorporate mindfulness into your walk To get the most out of your walk, add a dose of mindfulness into your routine, says Samantha DeCaro, a psychologist in Pennsylvania. 'There are various techniques that can help you stay present,' she says. 'Notice the colours, temperature, and smells around you. Shift attention to the air on your skin, the feeling of the ground beneath your feet, and the physical sensations happening inside of you.' Pay attention, on purpose, to the rhythms, melody, and harmonies of the songs on your playlist. 'When distracted, simply observe your breath entering and exiting your lungs to anchor back into the present moment,' she adds. Don't beat yourself up if you can't sustain positive thoughts the whole time. If you notice you're having trouble thinking positive thoughts, be compassionate with yourself, DeCaro says. Avoiding what's floating into your head isn't likely to quell those nagging thoughts.  'The paradox of avoidance is that it can often strengthen the very thing we're trying to avoid,' she says. 'If drowning out your thoughts isn't working for you, try to simply notice your thoughts without judgment and remind yourself that our thoughts aren't facts. Notice your breath moving in and out of your lungs or tap into your five senses.' And if walking for a long stretch isn't working for you on any one day, cut yourself some slack there, too. 'Be sure to tune into and honour your body's cues rather than relying on a set of external rules,' DeCaro says. 'There will likely be days when choosing to rest at home or taking a much shorter walk will be what your mind and body truly needs.' Move celebrates exercise in all its forms, with accessible features encouraging you to add movement into your day - because it's not just good for the body, but the mind, too. We get it: workouts can be a bit of a slog, but there are ways you can move more without dreading it. Whether you love hikes, bike rides, YouTube workouts or hula hoop routines, exercise should be something to enjoy.", "1ecf6706df16db0475c35aeb2bbbabbe84741124e51803add57ff284": "Criticism of Boris Johnson from fellow Tories in the aftermath of the Sue Gray report was muted, with few MPs willing to offer a public full-throated condemnation of their party leader.  The partygate report revealed booze-fuelled partying into the early hours, cleaners having to scrub red wine off the walls, a fight between staff, and a karaoke machine at the ready under the prime minster's watch.    The civil servant's inquiry blamed 'senior leadership' at the top of government for allowing lockdown-busting parties to take place in Downing Street and Whitehall. But there were few signs the revelations had moved Tory MPs any closer to triggering a vote of no confidence in the PM - as evidenced by the empty benches in the chamber - that could squeeze him out.   Backbencher Julian Sturdy was the first new Conservative MP to join calls for Johnson's resignation after the inquiry, describing partygate as a 'distraction' during a challenging time for Brits. Meanwhile, former minister Tobias Ellwood was heckled by fellow Tories in the Commons chamber as he questioned whether they could continue to defend Johnson's behaviour. Ellwood, a prominent critic of the prime minister, challenged Johnson over the 'damning report' which revealed an 'absence of leadership, focus and discipline in No. 10'. He asked fellow Tories 'are you willing day in and day out to defend this behaviour publicly' and asked: 'Can we win the general election on this current trajectory?' Sturdy said the Gray report showed Johnson 'has presided over a widespread culture of disregard for the coronavirus regulations'. In a statement posted on Twitter, he said: 'This is clearly a time when we cannot have any doubt about the honesty, integrity, and personal character of the prime minister. 'While I thought it important to wait for the conclusion of the Metropolitan Police investigation and the publication of the Sue Gray report, I am now unable to give the prime minister the benefit of the doubt and feel it is now in the public interest for him to resign.' Prior to the report, other senior Tories voiced their disquiet.   Steve Baker, who was pivotal in bringing down Theresa May over Brexit, ominously tweeted an NHS Covid campaign poster urging people to obey lockdown rules; Tom Tugendhat said he is 'talking to colleagues' about whether they should dump Johnson; and former Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson went further by saying Johnson should resign.  But that's about it. At a meeting of the 1922 committee of backbench Tory MPs on Wednesday evening, where Johnson apologised, the atmosphere in the room appeared muted, but the PM faced no dissenting voices. One source said the mood was 'pretty subdued' and that the tone was 'definitely more contrite' compared to previous meetings. A party source said Johnson felt partygate had been 'pretty excruciating' and that Sue Gray's report had had the effect of having a mirror held up to the working of No.10 'which is always very sobering'. However, the source added that the mirror had been 'distorted' at times because civil servants had in fact worked 'extremely hard' during the pandemic period. The prime minister was said to be 'particularly disgusted' that security staff and cleaners had been treated badly by officials and had apologised to them in person on Wednesday. According to the source, he also conveyed to MPs that he got things wrong and that he was 'ultimately responsible' for the goings-on in Downing Street but that he hoped from the 'bottom of his heart' that the country could move on to talk about bigger issues. 'We need to stop talking about Westminster and start talking about the people who send us here and the issues that matter to them,' Johnson is understood to have said. A moment of levity came when one attendee suggested that alcohol be banned in government departments, to which Johnson replied that he 'wasn't particularly big drinker himself but if alcohol was banned in 1940 we might not have won the Second World War'. Asked by reporters whether Johnson should resign in the wake of Gray's report, the party source said that outcome would be 'ludicrous'.  'The prime minister throughout this has not been sitting in solitary confinement waiting for Sue Gray to deliver her report, he's been beavering away endlessly on sorting out energy policy, sorting out illegal immigration, helping president Zelesnkyy to see off a superpower trying to invade his country, on getting the help needed to hard-working families, and he will carry on doing that, he has a massive mandate from the last election, he overwhelmingly won the leadership of the Conservative Party,' the source said. 'We're halfway through an electoral term and half of it has been taken up by wrestling through a global pandemic where he got all the big calls right. 'So, the idea that he should just pack up at this point is ludicrous. It's more about his determination to deliver what he promised to the British people than wondering, 'Oooh, I wonder whether I should go because I got some criticisms today'.'    Speaking to reporters, Johnson supporter Jonathan Gullis said the PM had been 'extremely apologetic'. 'He knows there is anger and upset in the country but what we do need to do is make sure that we're delivering on our agenda,' he said. 'I thought he was extremely measured, I thought he was extremely compassionate, I think he fully understands that there's a lot of rebuilding to do with some colleagues but also in the wider country and I feel very confidently that we're going to get back on track.' Asked what the prime minister's main message was, Gullis replied: 'Key message is that he's sorry and we've got to win back the trust of the country.'  However, a separate source gave a very different assessment. They said: 'The damage is done. He'll survive, but the party is heading for a brutal reckoning with the British people in 2024. They won't be as forgiving.' One account of the meeting was that it was 'a performance from a man well-practised in apologies'. And some Tory critics have even rowed back. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said on Wednesday that Sue Gray's report is 'very damaging' - but he insisted that getting rid of Johnson and 'changing prime minister right now would only help Putin'. Ross, also a Westminster MP, has previously called for the prime minister to quit, but changed his position in the wake of the Ukraine conflict. Ross has said if the privileges committee found Johnson had intentionally misled the Commons, there was an 'expectation' he would have to stand down. Meanwhile, Cabinet ministers loyally put out a string of near identical supportive tweets around the theme of 'it's time to move on'. The next tests of Johnson's authority within the party is likely to be two crucial by-elections.", "e1dae880cd3b2348977e27298b88648ffac688d5564f6170685019de": "Rishi Sunak is expected to announce plans to give every household in Britain up to PS400 off their energy bills as he makes a u-turn on levying a windfall tax on the soaring profits of oil and gas firms. The chancellor's significant package of measures to ease the cost-of-living crisis is set to be unveiled on Thursday - a day after Sue Gray's controversial partygate report. Treasury sources did not deny reports Sunak would use his announcement to scrap the requirement to repay the PS200 discount on energy bills, and could increase the level of the grant to as much as PS400. The Times reported that the previously announced loan on energy bills will be replaced with a grant that will not have to be paid back. Details of the one-off tax to fund fresh support measures were not known but Labour is likely to claim a victory of sorts after it campaigned for the measure against opposition from Boris Johnson. Ministers have spent months criticising the idea of a windfall tax because of its potential impact on investment. Earlier this month, not a single Conservative MP voted for Labour's call for a windfall tax on energy giants as the motion was defeated in the Commons.  Measures which have been discussed as part of a package worth around PS10 billion could include a further increase to the warm homes discount to help low-income households cope with rising energy bills. Other measures which have been discussed include increases in the winter fuel allowance, a further cut in council tax or a VAT cut. The need for extra help was illustrated by Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley's indication that the energy price cap will increase by a further PS830 to PS2,800 in October.  On Wednesday a Tory source said the arguments had been 'tested rigorously' within both the Treasury and wider government. 'There's a high threshold that any package that we bring forward delivers more gain than pain, that the gain is worth the pain, that it does not jeopardise the investment,' he said. 'You don't introduce random taxes that make the economic environment unpredictable.' Offshore Energies UK (OEUK), which represents the offshore oil and gas industry, has warned a one-off tax on North Sea firms would see higher prices and do long-term damage to the oil and gas industry. The chancellor will need to be careful that any extra help he puts in to the economy does not add further to inflation, which is running at a 40-year high. As well as the possible impact on inflation, the chancellor's ability to help beyond the PS22 billion package already announced will also be restricted by the state of the nation's finances. A Treasury spokesman said: 'The chancellor was clear that as the situation evolves, so will our response, with the most vulnerable being his number one priority. 'He will set out more details tomorrow.'", "dc985bbd7886345ee7fbcb8e208d82a226ea46ab9cb79632a6b8992f": "UVALDE, Texas -- In a stunning moment on Wednesday, former Democrat representative Beto O'Rourke confronted Texas governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, over gun control policy at a press conference where officials were giving updates on the mass shooting at an Uvalde elementary school. 'You're doing nothing. You're all doing nothing,' O'Rourke told the officials assembled on the stage. One of them repeatedly shouted back, 'Sir, you are out of line!' Lieutenant governor Dan Patrick told O'Rourke he was 'an embarrassment'.  An 18-year-old ran into Robb Elementary School in the small west Texas town on Tuesday, killing 19 children and two teachers with an AR-15 rifle. Seventeen more were injured, Abbott said earlier at the press conference. The man, who was killed by responding officers, had shot his grandmother in the face before driving over to the school. He posted his intentions to Facebook shortly before the rampage, Abbott said. As Abbott finished his remarks and introduced Patrick, O'Rourke approached the stage to interrupt. His initial remarks were drowned out by crosstalk from different attendees -- some cheering him and many others jeering.  O'Rourke made a clear comment directed at Abbott while law enforcement moved to escort him out.      'This is on you,' O'Rourke said. 'Until you choose to do something different, this will continue to happen. Somebody needs to stand up for the children of this state or they will continue to be killed just like they were killed in Uvalde yesterday.' A man standing near O'Rourke interjected: 'This is propaganda, bro. Get out of here. You're trash, man.'  As O'Rourke exited, some of his supporters chanted, 'Let him speak!' One person asked, 'How about the First Amendment?' The Republican elected officials at the dais criticised O'Rourke with varying degrees of subtlety once he was out of the room. 'There will be plenty of time to discuss and analyse what happened yesterday,' Patrick said. Texas House speaker Dade Phelan concurred. 'Mayor, I'm sorry you had to witness that outburst,' Phelan said to Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin. 'Now is not the time to politicise pain and suffering.' In his initial remarks, Abbott had acknowledged that 'people are rightfully angry about what's happened', but did not offer gun policy solutions. 'Now more than ever,' Abbot said, what the Uvalde community needs 'is our love'. 'What they need is uplifting from all of our fellow Texans and all of our fellow Americans,' the governor said. 'And let me emphasise something that I know you all know, but the reality is as horrible as what happened, it could've been worse. The reason it was not worse is because law enforcement officials did what they do.' Abbott called for better mental health care in the west Texas region. But when asked by a reporter whether he would reconsider accepting federal funds to expand Medicaid to that end, he said no. Patrick similarly suggested there was little policy action that could be taken, saying: 'Evil will always walk among us.' 'In times like this, I've seen it ... in these other shootings, Sutherland Springs, El Paso, Odessa, Santa Fe, it's God that brings a community together,' he added, referencing other mass shootings in the US. 'It's God that heals a community.'  Following the outburst, Abbott criticised the relatively strict gun control policies of states with the nation's larges cities, including California, Illinois and New York.  'There are, quote, real gun laws in Chicago,' Abbott said, then claimed such measures do not work. 'Hate to say this, but there are more people who were shot every weekend in Chicago than there are in schools in Texas.' Chicago has strict gun control laws, but nearby states like Indiana do not, which allows people to easily access weapons. Outside the venue, O'Rourke continued his call for stronger gun control measures and better access to mental health care.  'Now is the time to stop the next shooting,' he said. 'Right after Santa Fe high school was the time to stop the next shooting. Right after El Paso was the time to stop the next shooting. Right after Midland, Odessa was the time to stop the next shooting.' 'In each case, we say, 'This isn't the time.' Now is the time.'

The Downing Street cleaners, who had to deal with the mess, were treated with a 'lack of respect'. Sue Gray's report into the partygate saga, a series of lockdown busting social events in No.10 and Whitehall, was released on Wednesday. The civil servant blamed political and official 'senior leadership', presumably the prime minister, for what happened. One senior Boris Johnson aide, the report shows, had whatsapped a colleague after one drinking party that they 'seem to have got away with' it. And while the report is damning, Johnson appears to have made it through the day without a serious challenge to his leadership from Tory MPs. But he has not gotten away with it quite yet. This is what happens next. The privileges committee The Metropolitan Police investigation is over. As is Gray's. But another parliamentary inquiry is shortly set to start. MPs on the Commons privileges committee are due open an investigation into whether the prime minister misled parliament. On multiple occasions, in parliament, Johnson denied knowledge of any rule breaking in No.10.  On December 1, 2021, Johnson told the Commons: 'All guidance was followed completely in No.10.'    Later that month he also told parliament he was 'sure that whatever happened, the guidance was followed and the rules were followed at all times'. On December 8, 2021, Labour MP Catherine West asked him: 'Can the prime minister tell the House whether there was a party in Downing Street on November 13?'   Johnson told her: 'No. But I'm sure whatever happened the guidance was followed and the rules were followed at all times'. The Gray report includes photographs showing the prime minister raising a glass while stood behind a table littered with wine bottles and food at a leaving do for departing communications director Lee Cain. The pictures were first made public by ITV News earlier this week.  At the time, only two people from different households were allowed to mix indoors - unless it was for work purposes. In a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Johnson said he believed it was part of his work, his 'duty', to offer a speech and toast in person. The ministerial code states that 'ministers who knowingly mislead parliament will be expected to offer their resignation'. But the key word there is 'knowingly' - Johnson's defence has been that he did not think anything he did broke the laws that he had imposed on the country. And even if the committee does decide Johnson misled parliament, he does not have to resign. The person in charge or enforcing the ministerial code, is Johnson.   The public Ultimately it seems unlikely the prime minister would resign. Instead his fate rests in the hands of his MPs. It takes 54 of them to demand a no confidence vote in his leadership before a contest can be triggered. Johnson being fined by police for breaking Covid laws did not cause that threshold to be met. And so far as is known, neither has the Gray report. And even being found to have misled the Commons might not be enough. But that might change if Conservative MPs believe Johnson is no longer the election winner he once was. In June, there will be two by-elections, probably on the same day. The 23rd is seen as the likely date. Wakefield in Yorkshire and Tiverton and Honiton in Devon will be electing new MPs. Both are currently held by the Conservatives. But the party risks losing Wakefield to Labour and Tiverton to the Lib Dems amid a spiralling cost of living crisis and any fallout from partygate. The contest in Wakefield was triggered after Conservative MP Imran Ahmad Khan was convicted for sexually assaulting a boy. The Tories won the seat by 3,358 votes in 2019, until then it had been held by Labour since 1932. In Tiverton, a by-election was triggered after Tory MP Neil Parish quit over revelations he watched porn on his phone in the Commons chamber. Parish won the seat in 2019 with a healthy majority of 24,239 over Labour, and it has been Conservative since its creation in 1997. But while Labour is currently in second place, the constituency had for many years been a close fight between the Tories and the Lib Dems. The Lib Dems, boosted by the capture of neighbouring Somerset council in the local elections earlier this month, are hoping for a resurgence in their former south west heartland. The party is aiming to repeat its success at the recent North Shropshire by-election, where it overturned a 23,000 Tory majority held by disgraced MP Owen Paterson. If the Conservatives lose both seats, Tory MPs might decide Johnson is leading them to a general election disaster and move against him.

The long-awaited civil servant's inquiry blamed 'senior leadership' at the top of government for allowing lockdown-busting parties to take place in Downing Street and Whitehall.   In an implicit criticism of the prime minister, she said those in charge 'at the centre, both political and official, must bear responsibility' for what went on.  She also said the behaviour of those involved 'fell well short' of the standards the public expected of those running the country.   The 37-page report into 16 gatherings comes after the Metropolitan Police's investigation issued 126 fixed penalty notices to 83 people, including the prime minister, his wife Carrie and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak. At a press conference following the Gray report's release, ITV News journalist Paul Brand - who has broken a series of partygate stories - challenged the PM over whether his words in recent weeks were credible.   He said: 'Prime minister, you said so far that some of this rule breaking was news to you. You told MPs, you told us all categorically, that no rules were broken. But this is your home. You saw what was going on, you participated in what was going on, you made the rules as prime minister, so it does beg the question: are you a liar?'  On December 1, 2021, Johnson told the Commons: 'All guidance was followed completely in No.10.'    Later that month he also told parliament he was 'sure that whatever happened, the guidance was followed and the rules were followed at all times'.   Johnson replied to Brand at the news conference: 'No.' He added that 'it didn't occur to me' that what he witnessed was a breach of the rules, as he admitted 'things did not go well' after he left one of the events. The PM said: 'I was in the cabinet room for a short period, standing up at my desk on June 19, 2020, and some people came in to congratulate me on my birthday. Now, there weren't many of them. It didn't occur to me that this was a breach of the rules. I will be absolutely frank with you, it didn't occur to me. It really didn't. And that was just the way it was. 'Similarly, when I was speaking to colleagues about the departure of another government adviser or an official, it didn't occur to me that this was anything except what I think was my duty to do, as prime minister, during a pandemic. And that is why I did it. And that is why I spoke as I did in the house of commons. 'And yes, as Sue has found and as everybody can see and as the evidence has shown, after I had been there ... things did not go well.' When asked if he heard music or partying upstairs, Johnson said: 'No. No. Let's be absolutely clear, this is a very, very big place. If you take No 10 ten and the Cabinet Office together, there are hundreds of rooms. 'My impression was that I was personally at work events, but that doesn't absolve me of responsibility for what happened in this place. I take that responsibility. I continue to make sure that we make changes. I have apologised today, not just again to the house and to the country, but also to the custodians and the staff, who now it turns out were wrongly and badly treated.'", "e27c6e0951ba152f0b0c39f12a50c70d5e737efd007aeaeea9844f6d": "", "af170a187f838283af1d237be6be0aae088294968a4c0f5896ae381a": "", "225d857e3367f92b3e897cd6f7ed1139138136feb99efa99c2ed43f0": "The topic of school safety is yet again in the news after at least 19 children and two teachers were killed on Tuesday in a shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas. In these horrifying moments, parents must face questions from their children, as well as their own concerns about safety.  Although it's important to respond to children's queries and have conversations around school safety, broaching this topic without causing unnecessary fear or anxiety can pose a challenge.  To offer guidance, HuffPost spoke to a couple of school safety experts about the best ways to tackle these issues with kids. Here are eight things to keep in mind when discussing school safety with children. Much of the advice can apply to parents and educators alike.  Take a glass-half-full approach 'We advocate for a glass-half-full approach with kids - focusing on the positive,' said Michele Gay, who co-founded the nonprofit Safe and Sound Schools after losing her daughter Josephine in the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Instead of emphasising potential dangers, she recommends drawing attention to places where students can find examples of safety and various things that support safety in school. 'It's all about orienting students to their space and using kid-friendly language,' she said. 'Always make sure that you're not using scary imagery or 'bad guys' or anything like that. Just talk about safe and unsafe. 'If you feel unsafe, how can you get to safety and where might you find safety? Who might help you find safety?' Don't try to scare kids Amanda Klinger, director of operations for the Educator's School Safety Network, echoed Gay's sentiment of positivity. Over the years, news reports have shown US schools conducting hyperrealistic active-shooter drills in which police fire blanks or shout and pound on doors - events that have been shown to traumatise students. 'That's not increasing the skills of the people in that school building,' Klinger said. 'When we have actual events, and we have to respond, yes, that's going to be scary for kids. But when I do a drill with kindergarteners, it shouldn't be, 'Boys and girls, when the homicidal maniac with the AK-47 comes to kill us, what would we do?' There's no reason we should do that.' Like Gay, Klinger noted that it's important to focus on finding safety. Teaching young kids how to quickly evacuate, whether it's because of a gunman or a collapsed roof, doesn't have to be frightening.  'Ask kindergarteners what we'd need to do if we needed to get out of the classroom in a hurry so that no one gets trampled or left behind,' she explained. 'We'd be careful with our bodies when we leave, we'd follow the teacher, we'd pay attention and we'd use our listening ears and our looking eyes. That's not scary.' Use age-appropriate activities One activity that Safe and Sound Schools promotes in classrooms is a game called Safety Tag. 'It works great with little ones, and all you need is a pack of Post-Its,' said Gay.  Educators gather their students in their classroom, cafeteria, gym or hallway and give each child a handful of Post-it Notes. Then they can ask the students to walk around the room and use a Post-it to tag anything they see that represents safety, makes them feel safe or could support their safety in various circumstances.  'Within a matter of 60 seconds, the room is usually littered with Post-its,' Gay explained, adding that kids often tag things like the fire extinguisher, the first-aid kit and even the teacher. 'That kind of approach gets them to stop and see that, in this uncertain world where we unfortunately hear about tragedy after tragedy, we are doing an awful lot and have many resources to support safety and keep everyone safe in schools.' Parents can do this sort of exercise with their kids as well, by asking them to find five things that keep them safe at school and report back when they return home that day. 'That's a great conversation starter for parents who want to make sure their children are aware of those things and know how to utilize them if they should need them - without coming at it from that really negative, worst-case scenario angle,' Gay said.  There are also many age-appropriate books that teach kids about safety. Gay recommends The Lockdown Drill by Deputy Becky Coyle. 'The book introduces in a gentle, kid-friendly way what this safety procedure is and why we do it in schools. It's good to sit down in a comfortable, cozy environment with kids to curl up with a helpful book. It's a no-stress way to open the door to these conversations.' Recognise safety comes in many forms Gay and Klinger both emphasised that school safety encompasses so much more than active-shooter drills and security checks. Other major safety issues include earthquakes, tornadoes, fires, floods, blizzards, bullying, sexual violence and playground injuries. Rather than harping on school safety events that make national news, it's more important to focus on the specific risks that students are more likely to face at their particular school.  'If my school is a mile downwind from a chemical plant, that's a more likely hazard than other things,' Klinger said. 'That doesn't mean we need to be paralysed by fear, but it means we need to see if we've addressed that risk.' Klinger said she gets concerned when she sees so much expenditure on strengthening the security of buildings. 'Having an additional lock or buzzer does nothing if the biggest risk we face at school is that we don't have adequate supervision at dismissal and a kid is going to be hit by a bus ... or the LGBT kid that's getting bullied. We need to make sure what we're doing is part of a comprehensive all-hazards approach.'  Focus on building life skills 'When we're talking about safety, we're talking about life skills,' Gay explained. 'Those things that we teach regarding safety in school can apply out in the world, at home, in the grocery store, at the movies, at the mall. Wherever you are, wherever you go, you want to take a little time to orient yourself. The information and behaviors kids learn can serve them for the rest of their lives.' Both Gay and Klinger noted that 'stop, drop and roll' is a classic life skill students learn as part of safety lessons in school. 'If you think about it, the thought of burning to death sounds really terrifying,' Klinger said. 'But we're able to talk to kids about 'stop, drop and roll,' and it doesn't cause the chaos, fear and anxiety that we see around other conversations about school safety.' To that end, it's crucial that educators frame these discussions in a way that helps students and parents understand they're doing different safety drills not because schools are fundamentally terrible, dangerous places, but because these are life skills.  'It's about knowing how to respond appropriately, how to follow directions, how to be aware of your surroundings,' Klinger said. 'Asking yourself, how would I evacuate this building if the roof collapsed?' Know what their schools are teaching Many parents, especially around the start of the school year, have questions about what's going on with safety in their child's school.  'Historically, this is not a conversation we invited parents to be a part of. When you start the school year as a parent, you receive a lot of paperwork -- including forms for parents to sign up for committees, projects or other types of volunteering - but there's hardly ever anything related to safety that involves parents,' Gay said. As parents come forward and ask questions, however, this has shifted a bit, as schools are sharing more information.  'Of course, schools aren't going to give parents the alarm codes or pass out the blueprints, and things like that. But certainly, they can and should be telling them about protocols that are in place,' she added.  Gay offered a number of questions parents should consider asking teachers: Which drills do you practice? How many times a year do you practice them? What kind of teaching goes on beforehand? How many ways are you able to quickly secure the classroom if you need to? How many ways are you able to get out of this classroom if you need to? In what ways are you able to communicate? Do you feel there's more you need that parents can provide? How can I help? Perhaps the biggest question, however, is: what kind of language do you use with my child to talk about these issues and prepare them for safety in a variety of circumstances? This question is significant because parents already have the basic math and reading education to support those curriculums at home, but they likely don't know what their kids are learning about safety. 'The safety curriculum needs to be supported by parents at home, too, just like science or reading,' Gay said. 'So what words are they using in school? Are they saying, 'Run, hide, fight' or 'Get out, keep out and hide out'? Are they using the word 'violence' or different vocabulary? That way, parents can weave that language into everyday conversation and help them learn about safety.' Beyond questions about language and protocols, parents should also ask what their roles are in the case of a crisis.  'Are you expecting me to stay at home, stay informed and wait to get the word about what I'm supposed to do next?' Gay said. 'If so, what's the most reliable way to get that information? Is it our local news station? The school website? Twitter? What tools do I have for getting information, and which ones do you want me using?' Be realistic and reassuring 'I think that when parents talk to their students, there needs to be a real discussion of how statistically unlikely these events are,' Klinger said. Although ESSN's research has shown a recent uptick in school-based violence and threats, she still emphasised that it remains statistically unlikely a given child's school will have an active-shooter event. It's important to ask kids to share their concerns, hear them out and respond in a realistic, reassuring way. Parents can note these threats are real, but many of them are not likely -- and even though that may be the case, there are still many ways to prepare for them in case they do come to pass. Getting kids involved in the preparation process can also be encouraging.  Use resources There are resources for parents that can help inform discussions about school safety with kids. The Safe and Sound Schools website offers safety toolkits that include a questionnaire for parents, as well as a specific 'Parents for Safe Schools' guidelines.  The ESSN website also offers free resources about moving beyond strictly security or active-shooter-focused approaches. Klinger and her mother, ESSN co-founder Amy Klinger, published a book called Keeping Students Safe Every Day: How to Prepare for and Respond to School Violence, Natural Disasters, and Other Hazards, which is geared toward educators and administrators but has gotten positive feedback from parents as well.  For parents looking to learn more about these issues, Amanda Klinger suggested the University of Virginia's Model for Student Threat Assessment and the U. Secret Service's Operational Guide for Preventing Targeted School Violence. Klinger also recommended parents look to school boards for guidance about what makes sense and what the best practices are. 'Parents can advocate for change. It's important to figure out what's best for students, not what's convenient for adults.'", "9b749a4a2735538fe897f8b2540adeeea9b3018d9499aec2f26fc6af": "With more than 78 monkeypox cases now confirmed in the UK alone, people are starting to fear that the disease could spread through the population rapidly. However, those aged 50 or over may be more equipped to deal with the virus than younger folk, because of a jab they received more than 40 years ago. What extra protection do the 50+ have? Those aged over 50 would have received the routine vaccination against smallpox, before the virus was officially eradicated - the only human disease to ever be wiped out. It would have been part of the World Health Organisation (WHO)'s global campaign to tackle smallpox between 1958 and 1977. But, the distribution of the jab was then wound down in most countries before the World Health Assembly said smallpox had been eradicated in 1980. Smallpox was an acute, contagious disease which seven out of 10 people recovered from although it left behind significant scars and in some cases, blindness. Anyone who caught it had an intense fever and a distinctive rash on the skin. What does this mean for monkeypox? Monkeypox is much milder, less deadly and less infectious than smallpox. It triggers a fever, chills, swollen lymph nodes and a rash across the skin, but symptoms usually clear up in two to four weeks, although it can leave scars behind. The strain which has recently made headlines is thought to have a 1% fatality rate, according to Reuters news agency. There is no specific vaccine for monkeypox widely available at the moment. However, the smallpox vaccine has since been proven to be 85% effective at protecting against monkeypox, too. In fact, some scientists have claimed that this monkeypox outbreak has been looming for 40 years, ever since the smallpox vaccine stopped being offered to the general public. Since the mass rollout came to a close the proportion of people without this protection has obviously grown, making it easier for monkeypox to be transmitted from animals into humans, and then between people. Dr Romulus Breban, researcher at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, told The Guardian: 'This outbreak was really waiting to happen.' He claimed that immunity had fallen significantly since the 1980s, adding: 'Our immunity level is almost zero. People aged 50 and above are likely to be immune but the rest of us not, so we are very, very susceptible.' The smallpox vaccine is now being offered to close contacts of monkeypox patients in the UK, including healthcare staff, to reduce the chances of symptomatic infection and severe illness. However, it does not look like it will be rolled out en masse just yet. Here's why parents shouldn't be worried Although those aged 50 and above will have an advantage at fending off monkeypox, experts are calling for parents not to worry. Dr David Porter, a paediatric infectious diseases consultant, told Sky News: 'As a parent with a child that might develop a rash, I don't think parents should be worried about this being monkeypox at this stage, because we're seeing a very low number of cases.' The doctor, from Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'And in all the previous outbreaks that have occurred outside of Africa over the last few years, we've seen very rare numbers of cases in children, so it's been predominantly in adults anyway.' He suggested that unless there had been direct contact with someone who has confirmed monkeypox, a rash on child might indicate chickenpox, or hand, foot and mouth disease instead. Monkeypox is transmitted through close physical contact, touching contaminated clothing, bedding or towels or touching the skin blisters or scabs which form on a patient. There is a slight risk of it spreading through coughing or sneezing, too.", "44f45e63431a66fd65ea127979395bd05c75861344faded13bb51418": "Harry Styles made a dazzling return to the UK stage after more than two years with his One Night Only gig in London on Tuesday night to showcase his new album Harry's House. The Grammy-award winning singer performed all 13 tracks from his critically acclaimed third studio album for the first time on home ground at the O2 Academy Brixton in south London. Harry jokingly addressed the lyrics in one of those album tracks, Keep Driving, knowing his mum Anne was in the audience watching the show. 'I'm sorry,' he said after singing the lyrics 'cocaine, side boob, choke her with a sea view', much to the crowd's delight. Adorned in white trousers paired with a white top with black polkadots, Harry told the crowd: 'What a lovely comeback. It's been a long time since I've played in the UK and I'm so so happy to be here, thank you so much.' He added: 'I have to say, I'm the proudest I've ever been of anything I've ever done. I love it so much and I really hope you like it.' Harry later treated the sold-out crowd of adoring fans to an encore of previous hit tracks including Adore You, Watermelon Sugar, Sign Of The Times and Kiwi. He also paid tribute to his One Direction past with a rendition of What Makes You Beautiful, the smash hit debut single by the former boy band. He also reflected on the difficult couple of years the world has experienced, saying: 'There's a lot of stuff happening in the world right now and over the last couple of years we've all went through so much collectively and as individuals.  'And I pray that we just go home and be nice to each other.' The show's ending featured a poignant moment as he carried the Ukrainian flag, which had been given to him by a fan, while singing Sign Of The Times. He also restarted the song after stopping the show so security could assist fans who had succumbed to the heat of the venue. Harry released his latest album, Harry's House, last week to huge critical acclaim. The critics have been unanimous in their praise for singer's third long player, describing it as 'undoubtedly his best record yet'.

'If people on the internet get upset about it, the comedian's always like: 'Bad luck! That's my job. I'm a stand-up comedian, I'm meant to challenge people,'' James continued. 'If you don't like being challenged, don't watch my shows. What's the matter guys, too challenging for you?'. 'Because you know who's long overdue a challenge? The trans community! They've had their guard down for too long, if you ask me. They'll be checking their privilege on the way home now thanks to you - you brave little cis boy!' Following the debut of Ricky's new Netflix show SuperNature - which has faced heavy criticism due to jokes made about trans people throughout the After Life creator's set - James' comments have once again resurfaced on Twitter: Earlier this month, James was asked about the viral clip during an interview with Metro. He explained: 'It was important to me to do it because - first of all, it started, like a lot of comedy routines do, if you see something that's ridiculous or silly, then you want to make a joke about it... 'I think the attitude of comedians saying that they're challenging people with their comedy and then punching down is just completely nonsensical because that's not how challenging people works. That was the first thing that made me want to do a routine about it. 'And then I guess I carried on doing the routine because if, in your place of work, people are behaving in a way that's not appropriate or acceptable, or that you're opposed to, it's probably on you to speak out about it.' Gervais' new Netflix show opens with him telling the audience that his jokes are intended to be 'ironic'. 'That's when I say something I don't really mean, for comic effect, and you, as an audience, you laugh at the wrong thing because you know what the right thing is,' he explains. 'It's a way of satirising attitudes.' He then goes on to refer to cisgender women as 'old-fashioned women... the ones with wombs, those fucking dinosaurs', before making disparaging comments about trans women. The set then includes an imagined conversation between a cis woman objecting to sharing a toilet with trans women, including a joke about rape. Gervais' remarks have already been widely condemned, including by the LGBTQ organisation GLAAD and several comedians on Twitter. Netflix previously came under fire over comments featured in Dave Chappelle's stand-up special towards the end of last year. During his show The Closer, he argued that 'gender is a fact' and said he was 'team TERF', an acronym for trans-exclutionary radical feminist. After Chappelle's special sparked protests and even walk-outs from staff members, Netflix made an update to its corporate culture guidelines, which now includes a section stating that employees may 'need to work on titles you perceive to be harmful', urging them 'Netflix may not be the best place for you' if they disagree with this. The streaming giant's chief executive Ted Sarandos also defended Chappelle, insisting that The Closer did not 'cross the line on hate'. HuffPost UK has contacted representatives for Ricky Gervais and Netflix for comment.", "f28341238d118fd421f8138498bd08da8c9283479796f188f23a0b93": "Boris Johnson's attempts to excuse his involvement with the partygate scandal following the release of Sue Gray's report appears to have impressed precisely no-one on Twitter - or in the Commons - today. The top civil servant's probe into the Downing Street gatherings which took place throughout various lockdowns was finally released on Wednesday, after months of anticipation and a concluded police investigation. The prime minister subsequently addressed the Commons about the scandal, (six months after it first began) and extended his apologies to the House. He said that he took 'full responsibility for everything that took place on my watch', but that he had no idea some gatherings went on until the early hours and that he was 'surprised and disappointed' by some of the revelations. Then, he added: 'Frankly, I have been appalled by some of the behaviour, particularly in the treatment of the security and the cleaning staff.  'And I'd like to apologise to those members of staff and I expect anyone who behaved in that way to apologise to them as well.' This apology did not land well with anyone, it seems. Plenty of Conservative MPs left the Chambers when Johnson started his statement about partygate.   Even the ones who stayed were not impressed, including former prime minister Theresa May.  Then his specific excuses went down like a lead balloon with Twitter... Then, in response to Sir Keir Starmer's statement about the Downing Street parties, Johnson quickly referred to the 'beergate' incident which put the Labour leader in the spotlight instead. He joked about the curry and drinks Starmer was seen with at a work event - another move which did not land with people watching. And all this happened when the prime minister was formally addressing the Sue Gray report. In the hours before Johnson's apology began, people rallied on Twitter in fury over what the Gray probe had uncovered. Unsurprisingly, this chapter in the partygate saga has triggered a snap poll from YouGov where 59% of participants said they believe Johnson should resign.", "4f57b8204de2364d9ecc6174f18627915a1f531d774b9f052d69b912": "Well, you didn't really believe Boris Johnson when he said he had been 'humbled' by partygate, did you? The prime minister's act of contrition in the wake of the Sue Gray report lasted all of five minutes before the mask slipped and he was back to his normal self. Cracking a joke that even Dominic Raab couldn't bring himself to sycophantically laugh at, the PM branded the Labour leader 'Sir Beer Korma' in reference to his entanglement with Durham Constabulary over a lockdown takeaway. It felt a bit like when, in the debate which followed Gray's interim report in January, he accused Starmer of failing to prosecute Jimmy Saville when he was director of public prosecutions. That gaffe led to a wave of criticism from Tory MPs and almost led to a vote of no confidence in his leadership. Johnson has no such worries this time. The full Gray report is damaging for the prime minister, but not fatal. While she says that the 'senior leadership at the centre, both political and official, must bear responsibility' for the breaking of Covid laws in Number 10, she avoids making any direct criticism of the PM. And although there are embarrassing revelations about the debauched culture inside Downing Street, with red wine on the walls and staffers drinking so much that they threw up, there is no smoking gun about Johnson's personal involvement. HuffPost UK has been told that 'at least one' Tory MP this morning submitted a letter of no confidence in the prime minister to 1922 committee chairman Graham Brady, but they are still likely to be well short of the 54 needed to trigger a vote on his leadership. It was also noticeable how sparse the Conservative benches were for Johnson's statement, with one MP observing: 'So few were willing to abase themselves by asking a supportive question.' Nevertheless, the main reason why the parliamentary party were reluctant to knife him yesterday - the lack of an obvious, vote-winning replacement - still holds true today. So Tory MPs remain strapped in to the Johnson rollercoaster - and no amount of co-ordinated tweets from supportive cabinet ministers can change the fact that, as things currently stand, it is heading for a major derailment come the next election.", "9e51af254d70fc33528ab451e571c51dcb4a13b47be0b7d3476f9a95": "Kate Moss has refuted claims that Johnny Depp pushed her down a flight of stairs during their relationship, as she testified in his ongoing defamation lawsuit against his ex-wife Amber Heard. On the 22nd day of the lawsuit, the model appeared via video-link from Gloucestershire, where she was asked about her former relationship with the Edward Scissorhands actor. She was questioned specifically about a trip they took to Jamaica during their time as a couple. Heard claimed in court last week that she'd heard a rumour that Depp had pushed Kate down some stairs during this trip. Asked if anything of note had happened during their holiday, Moss said: 'We were leaving the room and Johnny left the room before I did, and there had been a rainstorm. And as I left the room I slid down the stairs. And I hurt my back.' She continued: 'I screamed because I didn't know what had happened to me and I was in pain. And he came running back to help me and carried me to my room and got me medical attention'. Moss then reiterated that Depp had never pushed her down the stairs during this trip or ever during their relationship. 'He never pushed me, kicked me or threw me down any stairs,' she insisted. Depp is suing Heard over a 2018 article she wrote in the Washington Post, which his lawyers say falsely implies he physically and sexually abused her while they were together. He has denied all accusations. The defamation trial is now into its third and final week, with closing arguments expected to be heard on Friday. Over the past several weeks, jurors have heard details of multiple instances of abuse, with accusations of violence levelled at both Depp and Heard.

The prime minister said he took 'full responsibility for everything that took place on my watch' after the publication of the damning Sue Gray report. The top civil servant blamed 'senior leadership' at the top of government for allowing lockdown-busting parties to take place in Downing Street and Whitehall. She said those in charge 'at the centre, both political and official, must bear responsibility' for what went on. While admitting he briefly attended a leaving party, the prime minister said he did not realise how such gatherings went on 'far longer than necessary'. Johnson said he had 'no knowledge' of subsequent proceedings and he was 'surprised and disappointed' by some of the revelations.  Making a statement in the Commons, Johnson said: 'I also want to say above all that I take full responsibility for everything that took place on my watch. Sue Gray's report has emphasised that it is up to the political leadership in Number 10 to take ultimate responsibility and, of course, I do.' Johnson said staff were working 'extremely long hours' and 'doing their best' to help the country during the pandemic.  The PM said he was setting out the context, not trying to 'absolve' himself, and he briefly attended a gathering to thank staff for their service. As he was heckled, the PM said: 'I'm trying to explain the reasons I was there. 'It's clear from what Sue Gray had to say that some of these gatherings then went on far longer than was necessary and they were clearly in breach of the rules and they fell foul of the rules. 'I had no knowledge of the subsequent proceedings as I simply wasn't there.' The prime minister claimed he was as 'surprised and disappointed as anyone' as the revelations unfolded, adding: 'Frankly, I have been appalled by some of the behaviour, particularly in the treatment of the security and the cleaning staff. 'And I'd like to apologise to those members of staff and I expect anyone who behaved in that way to apologise to them as well.' Gray's report told how security and cleaning staff in 10 Downing Street were subjected to 'unacceptable' treatment by officials. 'I found that some staff had witnessed or been subjected to behaviours at work which they had felt concerned about but at times felt unable to raise properly, the report said. 'I was made aware of multiple examples of a lack of respect and poor treatment of security and cleaning staff. This was unacceptable.'", "f38ef164ffc3efdf5cb2a0453611fb44218defb612ed16699134c336": "Families who lost loved ones to Covid have hit out at the No.10 officials found 'drinking themselves sick' in Sue Gray's damning report into the partygate scandal.  The senior civil servant released her long-awaited report into the partygate scandal that has rocked Downing Street on Wednesday. She blamed 'senior leadership' at the top of government for allowing lockdown-busting parties to take place, and said that what went on 'fell well short' of the standards the public expected of those running the country. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group responded with a withering statement on the report's findings, which contained salacious details of excessive drinking and socialising by staff. Lobby Akinnola, spokesperson for Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, said: 'There we have it. Whilst the country had one of the highest death rates in the world from Covid-19, they were celebrating over cheese and wine and drinking themselves sick over a Karaoke machine. 'When they refused to learn lessons and allowed the virus to run riot in the second wave, killing more people than it had in the first, they instead prioritised Secret Santa. 'When they were texting colleagues about getting away with it, we were having to text our families telling them they couldn't come to their loved ones' funerals. 'The messages in the report show they knew how disrespectful they were being to the families they were failing, but that didn't bother them.' Turning its fire on the prime minister, the statement went on: 'Not content with partying whilst he failed to protect our loved ones, the prime minister has now spent months ignoring and lying to us. 'He has treated us like they treated their cleaning staff and security who challenged their law breaking at the time: like we're an inconvenience, like we're dirt. 'The Tory MPs that have kept him in power are no better. 'They should know that just as we will never forget being apart from those closest to us whilst they passed away, or having to hold miserable funerals with only a handful of people, millions will never forgive them for the disrespect they've shown.'  The 37-page report into the16 gatherings in Downing Street and Whitehall was finally handed to the prime minister at around 10am this morning. It followed the conclusion of the Metropolitan Police's own investigation into partygate, which resulted in 126 fixed fixed penalty notices being issued to 83 people, including the prime minister, his wife Carrie and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak. However, despite attending several other gatherings investigated as part of the probe -- including a now infamous leaving do for his departing director of communications Lee Cain -- Johnson received no more fines. In her report, Gray said: 'The events that I investigated were attended by leaders in government. Many of these events should not have been allowed to happen. 'It is also the case that some of the more junior civil servants believed that their involvement in some of these events was permitted given the attendance of senior leaders. 'The senior leadership at the centre, both political and official, must bear responsibility for this culture.' The report contains specific details about what happened at various gatherings, including one on June 18, 2020 when one staff member was sick and there was 'a minor altercation' between two people. At another there was 'red wine spilled on one wall and on a number of boxes of photocopier paper'. In one damning line, Gray wrote: 'I was made aware of multiple examples of a lack of respect and poor treatment of security and cleaning staff. This was unacceptable.' The report goes on: 'Many will be dismayed that behaviour of this kind took place on this scale at the heart of government. 'The public have a right to expect the very highest standards of behaviour in such places and clearly what happened fell well short of this.' In response, Johnson issued a an apology to MPs in the Commons. 'I have been as surprised and disappointed as anyone else in this House as the revelations have unfolded and, frankly, I have been appalled by some of the behaviour, particularly in the treatment of the security and the cleaning staff,' he said. 'And I'd like to apologise to those members of staff and I expect anyone who behaved in that way to apologise to them as well.' But he appeared to reject suggestions he had given previous misleading statements to the House about whether such gatherings took place. 'I'm happy to set on the record now that when I came to this House and said, in all sincerity, that the rules and guidance had been followed at all times, it was what I believed to be true,' he said. 'It was certainly the case that when I was present at gatherings to wish staff a farewell, and the House will note that my attendance at these moments - brief as it was - has not been found to be outside the rules. 'But clearly this was not the case for some of those gatherings after I had left and at other gatherings when I was not even in the building. 'So I would like to correct the record, to take this opportunity, not in any sense to absolve myself of responsibility - which I take and have always taken - but simply to explain why I spoke as I did in this House.'     ", "000e725df1f9e2c73a1738379ce9a1bb71b78c3e4743194e9f38a3ba": "Six months since the first revelations about lockdown busting parties held in Downing Street and Whitehall, Sue Gray has finally delivered her report into law breaking at the top of government. The report details what happened at a series of gatherings during England's lockdowns. Police have issued 126 fines for rule breaches, with the PM having received a single fixed-penalty notice for his birthday party. Gray's report is based on interviews with No.10 staff and includes whatsapp messages and photographs. Here are five key things you need to know from the 37-page document published on Wednesday. 1) Who was to blame? Gray says the 'senior leadership', both 'political and official', in Boris Johnson's administration must 'bear responsibility' for allowing the government's own laws to be broken. She concludes while there was 'no excuse' for anyone at any level to break the rules, the direction came from the top. 'It is important to acknowledge that those in the most junior positions attended gatherings at which their seniors were present, or indeed organised,' she says. 'Many of these events should not have been allowed to happen. It is also the case that some of the more junior civil servants believed that their involvement in some of these events was permitted given the attendance of senior leaders. 'The senior leadership at the centre, both political and official, must bear responsibility for this culture.' 2) 'Red wine on the walls'  The report contains specific details about what happened at various gatherings. At multiple parties staff were found to have 'drank excessively'. At one event someone 'was sick' and there was 'a minor altercation' between two people. At another there was 'red wine spilled on one wall and on a number of boxes of photocopier paper'. The parties often went on late. On April 16, the night before Prince Phillip's funeral, the last staff member left a gathering at 4:20am. Social distancing 'did not happen' despite warnings that it should. A 'karaoke machine which was set up' at one gathering. A child's swing and slide in the No.10 garden was 'damaged'. 3) Garden party a 'comms risk' On May 20, 2020, there was a gathering in the Downing Street garden of 30-40 people. Some have been issued fines by police for attending. It was organised by Martin Reynolds, who was then the PM's principal private secretary. In an email to staff, he asked them to 'bring your own booze'. The garden party took place as a Downing Street Covid press conference was ending. An email shows one No.10 staffer suggested people be 'mindful' there would be cameras so should not be 'walking around waving bottles of wine'. Gray has found Lee Cain, then No.10 communications director, also warned Reynolds against it.  In an email he wrote: 'I'm sure it will be fine - and I applaud the gesture - but a 200 odd person invitation for drinks in the garden of No.10 is somewhat of a comms risk in the current environment.' Following the partygate revelations in the press, Reynolds quit No.10. He is reportedly being lined to become UK ambassador to Saudi Arabia. 4) 'We seem to have got away with it' The Gray report also includes a whatsapp message sent by Reynolds on a later date to a government special adviser in which the May 20 event is referenced. Perhaps mindful that the event had broken the Covid rules, he says 'we seem to have got away with' it. 5) 'Unacceptable' treatment of cleaners Downing Street is staffed with civil servants and political appointees. But as with any office it also has many other people working there.  Gray says some staff had either 'witnessed or been subjected to behaviours' which 'they had felt concerned about but at times felt unable to raise properly'. 'I was made aware of multiple examples of a lack of respect and poor treatment of security and cleaning staff. This was unacceptable,' she says. More detail on this was reported by BBC Panorama, which revealed No.10 staff 'made fun' of a security guard when they tried to stop a 'party in full flow'.  6) 'Abba party' not investigated Gray's report is also notable for what is not in it. On November 13, 2020, a gathering was held in the PM's No.10 flat. It has been reported Carrie Johnson was present. Abba music was reportedly heard being played.  Gray says the prime minister attended, as did five special advisers. Food and alcohol were made available.  But the Metropolitan Police decided not to issue fines for the event. And Gray says she therefore decided it was 'not appropriate or proportionate' for her to conduct any further investigation.

The 46-year old African American man was arrested and killed after police officer Derek Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 15 seconds. This came only months after the killings of Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery. As well as prompting a new wave of Black Lives Matter protests, Floyd's death reignited conversations about race all around the world. Arguably, the pandemic had a part to play in this, as lockdown forced white people to sit and watch what police brutality can do to Black people in real time. Millions of white people around the world started showing their support by 'doing the work'  Part of doing this apparent work has been donating money to Black advocacy organisations and listening to Black people's experiences, but a major part was white people educating themselves about race through their own reading. During the resurgence of Black Lives Matter, books such as How to Be an Antiracist by Ibram X. Kendi and White Fragility: Why It's So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism by Robin DiAngelo jumped into the Amazon bestseller lists - not just for books about race or social justice, but overall. In the UK, Reni Eddo-Lodge became the first black British author to top the British book charts when her book, Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race, jumped 155 places in the paperback non-fiction list in a week. None of these books were newly published in 2020 (in fact they all came out the previous year), but their sales highlight that white people were willing to learn.  Two years on, I was interested to follow up. Did people actually read the books they bought? And if so, what did they learn and has the work continued? Wanting to find out more, I did a call out on Twitter and Instagram. I wasn't that surprised when I didn't get many responses. But given I have more than 12,000 followers on Twitter and 2000 on Instagram, I still found the silence telling. It's hard being vulnerable, of course, especially on social media, but have people digested all their anti-racism reading lists or do some consider buying and reading the books job done? Below, we hear from five white people who were willing to share what they've read in the past two two years - and how it's changed the way they see race and racism.  'White voices are not needed in every conversation' Ines Mendonca, 26, a writer from Portugal had a 'decent understanding' of race and racism before George Floyd's death, but wanted to learn more. 'I remember the death of Trayvon Martin and how that made me look at the treatment of Black people in America,' she tells HuffPost UK. Mendonca read a lot of James Baldwin, Maya Angelou and Toni Morrison during university, she says, but after Floyd's death her reading focused on police abolition. 'I researched a lot of Angela Davis's work to learn more about police brutality,' she says. 'When people started talking about abolition, I genuinely had no idea about what that could look like. I grew up never being scared of the police. I learned about things like redlining, the 13th amendment in the US and food deserts happening in areas where mostly Black people live.' Her biggest takeaway? 'It became so much clearer to me how endemic racism is in every aspect of society and it became so much clearer to me that Black people live in fear every day that something like what happened to George Floyd will happen to someone they love.' Mendonca has learned to listen more and talk less. 'White voices are not needed in every conversation. You want to know why XYZ is problematic? Pretty sure a quick Google search can help you do that... I also want to be told when I'm doing something wrong or have someone challenge my beliefs.'  'Capitalist systems promote inaction on racism' Will*, 34, a researcher from the North of England, grew up in a rural area that had a large white population so race was an abstract concept in his early years. 'That being said my parents were active in the Anti-Nazi League, so I've always been made aware of the injustice caused by racism,' he says.  'Before George Floyd's death and the growth of the Black Lives Matter movement, my focus was more on the negative effects on society that come from inequalities based on social class.' He has read Don't Touch My Hair and What White People Can Do Next, both by Emma Dabiri, as well as The Good Immigrant anthology, edited by Nikesh Shukla. 'I learned a lot about the roots of the concept of race and racism that emerged from colonialism and the slave trade,' Will says of this reading. 'Probably most importantly for me, I've learned more about the ways that capitalist systems promote inaction on racism - like advertising campaigns from companies which pander to anti-racist sentiments but who profit from exploitation. I've also engaged much more with intersectional theory as an explanation for our deeply unequal society.' Now that race and racism come up more in conversations with his friends and family, he tries to recommend the books he's read to others who want to learn. 'I've also tried to apply some of what I've learned to my work where I research inequalities in health outcomes,' he adds. 'I've taken part in action within my union to demand more equal pay and conditions because my area of work (like most) privileges middle-class, white males.' 'Dismantling white supremacy has to start with ourselves'  Emma*, a 34-year old teacher from Scotland, read What White People Can Do Next by Emma Dabiri and the Me and White Supremacy workbook by Layla F Saad. She set up a group of friends and acquaintances to work through each chapter and share their learnings and reflections - as Saad suggests.  'Me and White Supremacy was one of the most challenging and impactful books I've ever read,' Emma tells me. 'It made me realise that despite all the things I believed and was trying to do to challenge racism, I had never stopped to consider or unpack how growing up in a white supremacist society in Britain had affected me.' She adds: 'I learned that dismantling white supremacy has to start with ourselves, internally, and I'm going to keep working on that. It was deeply revolutionary about how much of a grasp white supremacy had on my mind despite all my knowledge. Ultimately, it was a really transformative experience.' Since reading these books, Emma says she's getting more comfortable with discomfort and interrogating her own emotions and assumptions. 'It's made me really check myself and also definitely become a more active ally - both in terms of emailing MPs and calling out racism when I see it.' 'I realised how severe the consequences of racism are' Sally*, a 65-year-old author, says that while she understood a 'fair amount about race' before Floyd's killing, she wasn't aware of 'just how bad' things were. 'His death and the Black Lives Matter movement helped me understand how badly Black people are still being treated,' she says. She has since read Why I'm No Longer Talking To White People About Race and So You Want To Talk About Race by Ijeoma Oluo. 'Both authors are female and I thought their writing was meaningful, raw and full of personal experiences,' says Sally. 'It helped me understand better the difficulties like job searching or renting a flat or buying something I'd have no problems with. The books also taught me to listen to what's being said, not assume I know how it feels. I realised how severe the consequences of racism are and that I need to do more to help.' 'We need to keep the important conversations going' Micro-aggressions were something that Sam*, 24, who works in marketing, knew existed but couldn't articulate. As well as Why I'm No Longer Talking to White People About Race, the Londoner's recent reading list has included Natives: Race and Class in the Ruins of Empire by Akala and Black and British: A Short Essential History by David Olusoga.  'I realised with some shame that there had actually been instances in the past where I might have been the aggressor due to my own ignorance,' she admits. 'I realised that there was a lot of unlearning to do in my everyday language.'  Sam feels her eyes have been opened. 'I'm actively trying to combat my own prejudices. Going forward, I try to have very open discussions with my friends and family on a regular basis about race to end any sense of stigma and keep the important conversations going.' She has also written to local schools about the curriculum. 'I truly feel (especially in Britain) that an understanding of the history of Empire and how so many cultures came to be here is so significant in understanding why the interplay between race and class is as it is in Britain today.' *Some names have been changed and surnames omitted for anonymity.  It's gratifying to see some white people have become allies to Black people and started unlearning racist ideologies, but there's still so much work to do. In the past week, we've heard about Raheem Bailey being racially and physically abused in school with little help from school authorities, to the point where he lost a finger fleeing his bullies. Earlier this year, the horrifying story of Child Q came to light in a safeguarding report: a 15-year-old school girl who was strip-searched by police without her parent's consent or any supervision, because she apparently smelt like cannabis. She was traumatised. Two reports in as many days this week highlight once again that Black women feel unsafe during pregnancy (and are still four times more likely to die in childbirth). Women reported discrimination and very patchy antenal, labour and postnatal maternity care, according to Five X More research. And the whole country still remembers in the aftermath of the Euros last year the abuse that England football players Marcus Rashford, Jordan Sancho and Bukayo Saka received on social media - the torrent of racist slurs and monkey emojis. Unfortunately, this list can go on and on. If you haven't started doing the reading, it's not too late, but it can't stop with education.

The Dallas Buyers Club star said the the spate of gun violence across America is 'an epidemic we can control', adding 'whichever side of the aisle we may stand on, we all know we can do better' in a statement he shared online. At least 19 children and two adults have been reported dead after a teenage gunman opened fire at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas. The shooting is the deadliest at a US primary school since the infamous Sandy Hook shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, in which 20 children and six adults were killed almost a decade ago. 'As you all are aware there was another mass shooting today, this time in my home town of Uvalde, Texas,' the actor said. 'Once again, we have tragically proven that we are failing to be responsible for the rights our freedoms grant us. 'This is an epidemic we can control, and whichever side of the aisle we may stand on, we all know we can do better. We must do better. 'Action must be taken so that no parent has to experience what the parents in Uvalde and the others before them have endured. 'And to those who dropped off their loved ones today not knowing it was goodbye, no words can comprehend or heal your loss, but if prayers can provide comfort, we will keep them coming.' Taylor Swift, James Corden, Amy Schumer and Chris Evans were also among the famous faces expressing 'rage and grief' in the wake of Tuesday's atrocity.   Addressing the shooting in a monologue on The Late Late Show, James said that on the issue of gun laws, America is 'one of the most backward places in the world'. 'When I dropped my kids off at school this morning and kissed them goodbye, it doesn't cross your mind that that could ever be the last goodbye,' he said. 'And the thought of that phone call, that your child is the victim in a mass shooting is beyond comprehension as a human being.' Taylor Swift shared a video of Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr, who delivered an emotional message in a press conference before the NBA western conference finals. 'Filled with rage and grief, and so broken by the murders in Uvalde,' she wrote in a tweet.   'By Buffalo, Laguna Woods and so many others. By the ways in which we, as a nation, have become conditioned to unfathomable and unbearable heartbreak. 'Steve's words ring so true and cut so deep.' Oscar's co-host Amy Schumer said: 'We are grieving with the Uvalde community, a predominantly Latinx community, and everyone else impacted by yet another senseless act of violence in our schools. 'This is yet another tragic example of how pervasive this public health crisis is in our country.' Captain America star Chris Evans tweeted: 'Fucking enough!' His fellow Marvel superhero Simu Liu called for 'accountability'. 'Heartbroken for the families, friends and classmates of Robb Elementary School,' he said. 'My deepest condolences go out to those affected, and my mind yearns for accountability. 'A system that allows for this many mass shootings simply must change. It's time to demand action.' Oscar-winning producer Finneas also expressed anger, writing: 'Anyone saying 'now isn't the time to talk about gun control' doesn't care that kids got fucking murdered today.'   Other celebrities expressing their shock and horror included Kylie Jenner, George Takei, and Jake Paul. Veteran Star Trek actor Takei added: 'There are no words. And there are no actions ever taken. 'If we want things to change, we must demand it from our leaders.' Poet Amanda Gorman, who shot to fame following a reading at US President Joe Biden's inauguration ceremony in January 2021, penned a poem and posted it on social media. It read: 'Schools scared to death. 'The truth is, one education under desks, Stooped low from bullets; That plunge when we ask. 'Where our children Shall live & if.' Sharing a link to gun violence charity Everytown, Amanda captioned her post: 'Americans--you know enough is enough. 'If you do anything today, let it not be just to grieve, but to act.'  Police said the shooter, an 18-year-old male who was clad in body armour, crashed his car outside the school before he entered the building and opened fire. He was killed by responding officers, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) said during a press conference.

The Labour leader said the imminent 'U-turn' was timed to deflect attention from Sue Gray's report into partygate. The Labour leader, who has been dubbed 'Captain Hindsight' by the prime minister, said: 'I'm told hindsight is a wonderful thing!'   During Prime Minister's Questions, Starmer said: 'It's been four and a half months since Labour first called for a windfall tax on oil and gas profits...every week he has a new reason for not doing it. 'He ordered all his MPs to vote against it last week, and now, surprise surprise, he's backing it. 'Prime minister, I'm told that hindsight is a wonderful thing...whilst he dithered and delayed households across the country suffered when they didn't need to. 'What is it about the Sue Gray report that first attracted him to a U-turn this week?' The PM hit back: 'There is no surprise about Labour's lust to put up taxes. There is nothing original about... they get on it. They absolutely love to confiscate other people's assets. What we prefer to do is make sure that we have the measures that are in place to drive investment in our country and drive jobs. 'And it's thanks to the steps that we took, thanks to the fact that we came out of Covid faster than any other European country which would not have been possible if we had listened to him, that we now have... unemployment at the lowest level since 1974. Put that in your pipe.' The clashes came after Gray's report blamed 'senior leadership' at the top of government for allowing lockdown-busting parties to take place in Downing Street and Whitehall.  In an implicit criticism of Boris Johnson, she said those in charge 'at the centre, both political and official, must bear responsibility' for what went on.  She also said the behaviour of those involved 'fell well short' of the standards the public expected of those running the country.   The 37-page report into 16 gatherings in Downing Street and Whitehall was finally handed to the prime minister at around 10am this morning.     It followed the conclusion of Operation Hillman, the Metropolitan Police's partygate investigation.   The force issued 126 fixed penalty notices to 83 people, including the prime minister, his wife Carrie and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak.  However, despite attending several other gatherings investigated as part of the probe, Johnson received no more fines.   In her report, Gray said: 'The events that I investigated were attended by leaders in government. Many of these events should not have been allowed to happen.   'It is also the case that some of the more junior civil servants believed that their involvement in some of these events was permitted given the attendance of senior leaders.

It boasts South Asian clothing, food, entertainment - everything I love in other cultural hotspots around London such as Ilford, Whitechapel or Forest Gate (Green Street). The trouble was, Southall, or even Ilford and other East London hotspots since I moved to Greenwich, were inaccessible to me.  But the Elizabeth Line is to remedy all that. Because within half an hour, I can now go from Woolwich to Ilford, or from Ilford to Southall.  Where it would take hours to go from one place to the other on the bus, it now takes less than 60 minutes, thanks to the line unveiled this week with much pomp and circumstance.  Though you might need to change for the trains going to your destination, the Elizabeth line route is still smoother than the journeys of yore.  And it means those who previously found these destinations too troublesome to get to can now enjoy communities they were previously not privy to. South Asians can relish between Southall, Ilford, Forest Gate, Whitechapel, Stratford, Romford and more - all of which boast many Asian paraphernalia.  Think of the late night Eid festivities of Ilford Lane now able to be enjoyed by so many more people, or Sikhs being able to access the biggest gurdwara in London - the Gurdwara Sri Guru Singh Sabha Southall. With connections in other non-London cities such as Reading (which inhabits 10,000 South Asians) and connections from Heathrow Airport, these hubs have become accessible for so many more. Southall is even the only Station with signage written in the Punjabi Gurmukhi script (aka Sikh script). And Twitter users are pointing it out, with many excited about the new opportunities for exploration.  With the next Eid coming up in July, I'll be making the rounds between each stop, probably with my mum in tow. And I suspect I won't be alone. But with the pull of samosas, aloo chaat, and a Bollywood film to boot, I might head there even sooner.

The PM is expected to issue another apology for the goings-on in 10 Downing Street in a Commons statement at 12.30pm. He is expected to tell MPs: 'I commissioned this report to set the record straight and allow us all to move on. I accept full responsibility for my failings. I am humbled by the whole experience. We have learned our lesson.' Johnson will then address the country at a televised press conference at 3.30pm, before appearing before the Tory backbench 1922 committee at around 5pm. The Gray report's damning findings could lead to more Tory MPs submitting letters of no confidence in Johnson to Graham Brady, the 1922 committee chair. At least 54 are needed to trigger a confidence vote. One backbench rebel told HuffPost UK: 'It feels like there'll be more letters now.' Prior to the report's publication, the BBC's Panorama revealed more details of what went on inside Number 10 during lockdown. Downing Street insiders told how Johnson would regularly attend drinking sessions, 'wine time Fridays' were a weekly occurrence and how a security guard was mocked for trying to break up one gathering. And earlier this week, the PM faced a further barrage of criticism after leaked photos emerged of him drinking at a leaving party for his former director of communications, Lee Cain, while England was under strict lockdown. In an attempt to move on from the partygate saga, Sunak is expected to finally unveil the government's plan to tackle the cost of living crisis, including a windfall tax on the bumper profits being enjoyed by the oil and gas companies, tomorrow.

A new poll of 1,000 girls aged 14-21 reveals that more than one in four (28%) are struggling to afford period products, and nearly one in five (19%) report being unable to afford period products at all since the start of 2022. One in 10 of the young women who took part in the survey had to go to a food bank to obtain free period products. And half of the girls who struggled to afford period products since the start of 2022 had to cut back on food and groceries to be able to buy them. This number dramatically increased by almost double compared to last year.  Almost a quarter (23%) of girls had to cut back spending money on school supplies to afford to buy period products and 19% cut back on buying non-prescription health products. Shockingly, the vast majority (80%) of girls who struggled or were unable to afford period products have used toilet paper as a substitute for period products, up an eighth on last year. Around 12% have used socks, 10% have used newspaper/paper and 7% have used other fabric. As the cost-of-living continues to rise rapidly - with the price of food, energy and multiple household items skyrocketing - the survey also found that overall, over a quarter (26%) of UK girls are concerned about being able to afford period products over the coming months. Rose Caldwell, CEO of Plan International UK, described the findings as 'devastating'.  'As we look to an uncertain future, many more families will face tough financial choices, and more young women than ever are likely to face issues affording the products they need,' she said. 'Period products are a necessity, not a luxury, and they need to be treated as such.' How can you help combat period poverty?  Let's be real: we need intervention from those in power to reduce the price of period products and tackle the cost of living crisis, so that women are girls can afford to buy them in the first place. You can write to big brands and your MP to get your voice on this heard.  But if you're able to donate items to support those in need, the sustainable period brand Dame recommends donating 'reusables or plastic-free products where possible, and remember pads are more popular than tampons'.  'Products need to make more financial sense, and the rise of reusable products like menstrual cups in particular is helping to address this as the cup can be used for an entire period each cycle and lasts for years,' a spokesperson explained.  'Single use products will almost always end up more expensive over time, so the move to reusables can really help here as long as we can get the products into people's hands for little or no cost.' Some charities prefer to receive donated products including pads, tampons and menstrual cups, whereas other organisations prefer monetary donations, so they can buy items most suitable for their clients and distribute accordingly. If you're not sure, always ask.  Where can you provide or find help? There are organisations around the country helping girls and women to access period products. We've listed just a few of them below:  Your local food bank or community hub The majority of food banks/hubs now stock period products, so your local centre is a good first port of call if you'd like to donate items or you need to access help. The Trussell Trust website has a directory of nationwide food banks, but you'll find others by googling support in your area or looking at local Facebook groups. While some food banks require a referral (from a GP or social worker), others do not. Never be afraid to walk in and ask for help. To donate to a food bank, check if there are preferred 'donation days' listed online, or place items for donation in community 'collection points' (often in supermarkets).  Freedom4girls  Freedom4girls s a Leeds-based charity that fights against period poverty. They work with people who menstruate to challenge stigmas and gender inequalities linked with menstruation. You can donate products directly to the charity via its multiple 'donation stations' situated in Leeds and other areas of West Yorkshire. The charity also accepts postal donations and financial donations. Products are distributed to women and girls in need, primarily among those based in Leeds and Sheffield. You can find details on how to donate here and request free products via this online form.  Bloody Good Period  Bloody Good Period has over 100 partners across England and Wales, including charities and food banks. They give period products to refugees, asylum-seekers and those who can't afford or access them. Since March 2020, they've been able to distribute over 100,000 packs of period products. The charity does not accept physical donations of period products, but it does reply on financial donations. It operates by bulk ordering products and distributing them across the country. You can read more about donating funds here, or even organise a Bloody Good Fundraiser.  Hey Girls  Hey Girls is a 'buy-one, donate-one' social enterprise, meaning every time you buy a period product via the site, you're helping another woman to access a product she needs. There are cups, pads, tampons, period pants and more available via the shop. Girlguiding  Girlguiding aims to end period poverty and the stigma associated with periods. They are a leading charity for girls and young women. They've teamed up with WaterAid to develop activities to get girls and young women talking openly about period. Schools Schools across the country can sign up to access free period products for pupils who need them.

The reality star and former glamour model was   banned from contacting Michelle Penticost directly or indirectly in 2019, under the terms of a five-year restraining order. She was also fined PS415 for hurling a foul-mouthed 'tirade of abuse' at Michelle during a row in a school playground. In January she was arrested and later charged with harassment, after allegedly sending Kieran a text message branding Michelle a 'c***ing whore', 'gutter slag' and 'piece of shit'. Appearing in Lewes Crown Court on Wednesday morning, Katie pleaded guilty to breaching the restraining order, having previously pleaded not guilty to the offence last month.  It was previously heard that the text message in question may have been in response to an Instagram post by Michelle, which she has always denied was aimed at Katie. The message read: 'Tell your c***ing whore, piece of shit, girlfriend not to start on me. 'She has a restraining order so shouldn't try [to] antagonise me as she is in breach and I'm sure she doesn't want people knowing that she was having an affair with you behind my back. That gutter slag.' Judge Stephen Mooney warned Katie on Wednesday: 'Clearly you have accepted responsibility for this offence and that you indirectly tried to communicate Ms Penticost despite her restraining order against you. 'I must warn you Ms Price that you are at risk of going to prison.' Judge Mooney said he will 'need to know' the background before considering Katie's sentence. She was bailed ahead of sentencing on 24 June. Last month, District Judge Amanda Kelly said the offence carries a maximum sentence of up to five years' imprisonment and warned Katie: 'You are in really grave danger of going to prison. 'This is a very serious allegation in which it is alleged you used indirectly vile and nasty language towards Ms Penticost, someone you were prohibited from contacting directly or indirectly by a restraining order.'    'It seems to me, Ms Price, that all of the children caught up in your relationships past and present need their adults to behave like adults,' the judge said at the time.

The After Life creator's newest show SuperNature began streaming earlier this week, and was quickly condemned over jokes about the trans community featured throughout his set. SuperNature opens with Gervais telling the audience that his jokes are intended to be 'ironic'. 'That's when I say something I don't really mean, for comic effect, and you, as an audience, you laugh at the wrong thing because you know what the right thing is,' he explains. 'It's a way of satirising attitudes.' He then goes on to refer to cisgender women as 'old-fashioned women... the ones with wombs, those fucking dinosaurs', before making disparaging comments about trans women. The set then includes an imagined conversation between a cis woman objecting to sharing a toilet with trans women, including a joke about rape.  Later in his show, Gervais also discusses developments in the treatment of HIV, commenting: 'That's not as good as it was, AIDS... in its heyday, it was fucking amazing, wasn't it, AIDS?' Gervais' show has already been condemned by the leading US LGBTQ organisation GLAAD, who have said that jokes like those featured in SuperNature are 'dangerous'.  'We watched the Ricky Gervais 'comedy' special on Netflix so you don't have to,' they said. 'It's full of graphic, dangerous, anti-trans rants masquerading as jokes. He also spouts anti-gay rhetoric and spreads inaccurate information about HIV. 'Netflix has a policy that content 'designed to incite hate or violence' is not allowed on their platform, but we all know that anti-LGBTQ content does exactly that. While Netflix is home to some groundbreaking LGBTQ shows, it refuses to enforce its own policy in comedy. 'The LGBTQ community and our allies have made it very clear that so-called comedians who spew hate in place of humor, and the media companies who give them a platform, will be held accountable. Meanwhile, there are PLENTY of funny LGBTQ comedians to support.' Gervais' remarks have also been heavily criticised on social media, including by many comedians on Twitter: Many also took the opportunity to repost an old set from British comic James Acaster, lampooning established comedians for taking aim at the trans community: Netflix previously came under fire over comments featured in Dave Chappelle's stand-up special towards the end of last year. During his show The Closer, he argued that 'gender is a fact' and said he was 'team TERF', an acronym for trans-exclutionary radical feminist. After Chappelle's special sparked protests and even walk-outs from staff members, Netflix made an update to its corporate culture guidelines, which now includes a section stating that employees may 'need to work on titles you perceive to be harmful', urging them 'Netflix may not be the best place for you' if they disagree with this. The streaming giant's chief executive Ted Sarandos also defended Chappelle, insisting that The Closer did not 'cross the line on hate'.

Speaking just hours after at least 21 people, including 19 children, were killed in an elementary school shooting in Texas, the coach delivered an emotional plea for action to stop the violence. 'Any basketball questions [tonight] don't matter,' Kerr said, shortly before his team's playoff to the Dallas Mavericks in Texas. Holding back tears, he recounted how just days before, elderly black people were targeted in a supermarket in Buffalo, and earlier this month, Asian churchgoers were killed in southern California. 'And now we have children murdered at school,' he added. Smacking the table as he starts to shout, Kerr said: 'When are we going to do something?' 'I'm tired, I'm so tired of getting up here and offering condolences to the devastated families that are out of there. ''I'm so tired, I'm sorry, of the moments of silence. Enough!' A longtime advocate of gun control, Kerr's father was shot dead in a terror attack in Beirut back in 1984. In his speech on Tuesday, Kerr pointed out that there were 50 senators refusing to pass a law on background checks on anyone wishing to purchase a firearm. He has repeatedly backed this bill, which passed the US House of Representatives last year but did not get to the Senate. He claimed: 'There's a reason they won't vote on it - to hold onto power.' Addressing those senators, Kerr pleaded: 'I ask you, are you going to put your own desire for power ahead of the lives for our children, and our elderly, and our churchgoers? Because that's what it looks like. It's what we do every week. ''I'm fed up, I've had enough, I'm going to play the game tonight but I want every person here, every person listening to this, to think about your own child, or grandchild, or mother, father, sister, brother. 'How would you feel if this happened to you today? We can't get numb to this.' He pointed out that the public cannot just have a moment of silence before continuing with business as usual. 'Fifty senators in Washington are going to hold us hostage. Do you realise that 90% of Americans, regardless of political party, want background checks?' He added: 'It's pathetic, I've had enough.' Not waiting for any media questions, Kerr walked quickly away from the microphone and off camera. The clip has since been viewed more than 17 million times. With more than 600,000 likes on Twitter in less than 12 hours, it definitely seems like he said what everyone is thinking - including Taylor Swift...

'Why are we willing to live with this carnage? Why do we keep letting this happen? Where in God's name is our backbone? 'It's time to act.

The average pump price has increased to 167.64p per litre, according to the RAC, quickly surpassing the previous average of 167.30p set on March 22. The conflict in Ukraine is having a massive effect on the global economy - and that includes petrol - which is why people are trying their hardest to save money on fuel where they can. And luckily, Martin Lewis can help you with that.  The app, called Petrol Prices, could help you save PS5 to PS10 each time you fill an average-sized tank. Lewis found that in Durham on Tuesday, petrol prices ranged from 163.8p a litre to 179.9p a litre. The Petrol Prices website and mobile app covers around 8,500 forecourts across the UK. The results are usually between one and four days old so they might not be an exact match when you go to top up, but it should be close enough. 'An average user saves PS200 a year by always locating the cheapest fuel locations. Now, by adding in reviews and more data, we allow customers to choose the best station, not just the most competitive,' the website says.  Simply download the app or go to the website, find the cheapest filling stations in your area by entering your postcode, town or city and how far you're willing to travel (up to 20 miles).  Why is petrol so expensive right now?  The raw price of crude oil - which is used to make petrol and diesel - had already spiked as pandemic restrictions eased around the world, because demand shot up but supply hadn't quite caught up yet. The war in Ukraine only made matters worse.   Russia is the world's second-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and the top producer of natural gas globally. The UK only receives 6% of its crude oil and 5% of its gas from Russia, according to the BBC, but that sanctions (designed to deescalate the conflict) have constricted supplies and driven up fuel prices worldwide.  RAC fuel spokesperson Simon Williams previously said 'The question then becomes where will this stop and how much can drivers take just as many are using their cars more and returning to workplaces.'

Steven has spoken candidly in the past about being addicted to drugs throughout the late 1970s and 80s, telling People magazine he took 'heroin, coke, Valium, anything that anyone came near with'. 'We believed that the road to wisdom was through excess,' he previously told GQ magazine. 'But it got really bad in the 80s.

'As a nation, we have to ask: When in God's name are we gonna stand up to the gun lobby ... do what we all know in our gut needs to be done?' Biden said in an emotional speech from the White House. 'Why are we willing to live with this carnage? Why do we keep letting this happen? Where in God's name is our backbone?' the president said. 'It's time to act. It's time for those who obstruct or delay or block common sense gun laws, to let you know: We will not forget. We can do so much more, we have to do more.' At least 18 young students and three adults were killed after an 18-year-old gunman opened fire at Robb Elementary School on Tuesday afternoon. The shooter was killed by responding officers. The school shooting is the deadliest mass shooting in the country this year. In his remarks Tuesday, Biden noted that it has been a decade since a gunman killed 20 children and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.  And the shooting in Uvalde came only 10 days after 10 Black people were shot dead by an 18-year-old white supremacist at a supermarket in Buffalo.  'I am sick and tired of it. We have to act,' Biden said, noting he has worked throughout his political career to try to pass common sense gun laws. He was vice president when the Sandy Hook shooting occurred.  'The idea that an 18-year-old kid can walk into a gun store and buy two assault weapons is just wrong,' the president added. 'For God's sake, we have to have the courage to stand up to the industry.'  The president then spoke to the 'parents who will never see their child again, never have them jump in bed and cuddle with them, parents who will never be the same.' Two of Biden's children have died.  'To lose a child is like having a piece of your soul ripped away. There's a hollowness in your chest. ... And it's never quite the same,' Biden said as he asked the nation to pray for the families.

Earlier this week, the two British stars - who appeared together in the 2019 horror film Midsommar - were snapped by paparazzi photographers on the beach in Ibiza. The photos were quickly shared online, leading many on social media to speculate the pair could have privately begun 'dating'. However, Florence has now dismissed these claims in a series of posts on her Instagram story. 'This is getting a little silly now,' she wrote. 'No, Will Poulter and I are not dating. We went to the beach with our friends, who are always about half a metre from us in every picture, but have been cleverly cut out/framed out so that it looks otherwise. 'You can LITERALLY see my best friend in the corner of so many shots and Archie's arms at the sides.' The Oscar nominee continued: 'I understand that the nature of this job is that you sometimes get your privacy completely bulldozed by paparazzi, but to fabricate this stuff actually does more damage than good. 'Thanks for saying we look sexy. Doesn't mean we're doing the sexy.' Florence - who has been in a relationship with Zach Braff since last year - added: 'On another note, a very important note. There's no need to drag people through this. 'Regardless of your opinion on who I should or shouldn't be with, at the end of the day, if you're complimenting someone by trolling another person... you're just bullying. There's literally no need to be horrible online - no need. 'Think about what you write. Think about who it affects. 'Anyhoo... onto more wonderful pictures of lovely people being gorgeous and tanned and fabulous!' Will's past credits include Midsommar, Dopesick and the special Black Mirror episode Bandersnatch. He is currently gearing up to make his Marvel debut as Adam Warlock in the third Guardians Of The Galaxy film.

George Eustice also insisted that Boris Johnson had not lied to parliament over Partygate, ahead of a tough day for the prime minister.  The environment secretary made the comments shortly before the publication of the full report into the scandal by senior civil servant Sue Gray.  It follows a chaotic six months during which the government was engulfed in allegations of lockdown breaches. The scandal saw Johnson and chancellor Rishi Sunak fined for breaking Covid-19 laws. Eustice told Times Radio: 'Clearly what happened in No 10 is a culture developed where they were working there, it was their place of work, and there were times when they would have a drink at the end of the day. 'That boundary between what was acceptable and what wasn't got blurred and that was a mistake and Sue Gray highlighted that in her first interim report and I think she is almost certainly going to say more about that when her final report comes out. 'The prime minister himself has accepted that and recognises there were of course failings and therefore there's got to be some changes to the way the place is run.' On another media appearance, the cabinet minister was adamant Johnson had not lied to parliament. 'Ministers and politicians are not supposed to knowingly mislead parliament,' the environment secretary told Sky News. 'The prime minister himself has also given a very clear account of his own understanding of all of those events that he attended, that he didn't regard them as parties, that he didn't regard them as breaking the rules. 'He has explained that, that was his understanding, and obviously where the police have said there were particular failings on his part, in respect of the birthday party where the cake was brought in, he has acknowledged that and paid that fixed-penalty notice.' Gray's report is expected to go to No.10 this morning before it is published on the Cabinet Office website. Johnson will face Labour leader Keir Starmer at Prime Minister's Questions at midday and he is also expected make a statement to the commons responding to the report. This evening he is expected to meet with the 1922 committee of Conservative backbenchers scheduled at around 5pm.  He is also expected to hold a press conference to address the public about the scandal.

Todd Boehly's PS4.25billion takeover of the Stamford Bridge club was approved by the Premier League last night. The Los Angeles Dodgers co-owner will become the club's controlling owner once the takeover is complete. California investment firm Clearlake Capital will assume the majority shareholding. The west London club was put up for sale in March before owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned over his links to Russian president Vladimir Putin. Chelsea have been operating under a special government licence, which expires on May 31. Culture secretary Nadine Dorries said: 'Last night the government issued a licence that permits the sale of Chelsea FC. 'Given the sanctions we placed on those linked to Putin and the bloody invasion of Ukraine, the long-term future of the club can only be secured under a new owner. 'We are satisfied the proceeds of the sale will not benefit Roman Abramovich or other sanctioned individuals. 'I want to thank everyone, especially officials who've worked tirelessly to keep the club playing and enable this sale, protecting fans and the wider football community.' Completion of the takeover will bring an end to a 12-week saga that was sparked by Abramovich officially putting the Blues up for sale on March 2.  He released a statement pledging to write off the club's debt and set up a foundation to aid victims of the war in Ukraine. The billionaire was then sanctioned by the UK government on March 10, with Downing Street claiming to have proven his links to Russian president Vladimir Putin. Chelsea were put under a strict government operating licence, with all of Abramovich's other UK assets frozen.

Sitting for prolonged periods of time is bad news for our health. In fact, just this week researchers warned adults to stick to one hour of TV per evening to reduce their risk of heart disease. And most of us know that a sedentary lifestyle is a leading cause of backache. But many of us - from office workers to drivers - can't help how much time we spend sitting on our butts. So, what can we do about it?  Small bursts of movement during the day, at lunchtime or straight after work can help counteract some of the issues associated with sitting all day. And focussing on the glutes is a great place to start.  'Many people can end up finding their glutes don't work as well as they should which can sometimes lead to tension in the lower back which can be painful,' explains Myprotein PT Adam Hameed (@askcoachadam).   'The sat down position is where the glutes are stretched and relaxed so what we want to do is just take a few minutes to re-activate the muscles so they can work in the correct order and put less tension through our lower back.' Want to give it go? Hameed has provided HuffPost UK with the below five-minute workout to get you started:  Butterfly Glute Bridges (3-5 sets x 10 reps) Lie on your back with the flat of your feet facing each other, and your knees facing outwards. You want to push off the floor with the blades of the feet, pushing your hips as high as they will go until you feel your glutes squeeze. Hip Thrust Walk Outs (2-3 sets x 5 reps) Lie on your back with your knees facing the ceiling and the flat of your foot on the floor. Lift your hips up as high as possible and slowly taking little steps walk your heels out away from your body keeping your glutes squeezed the whole time and when you reach your limit take little steps back in until you reach the start position. Your glutes should never touch the floor. Kick Backs (3 sets x 15 reps) Placing your hands and knees on the floor, raise one of your heels to face the ceiling from behind you. Kick the heel as high as possible to reach the ceiling and bring it back to a bent 90-degree position. Reverse Lunges (2 sets x 20 reps alternating) Stand with two feet next to each other and take a step backwards long enough as if you were to kneel down onto one knee but without letting the knee touch the floor, drive through the feet to push yourself back up and stand up with your feet next to each other and repeat on the other side. Squats/ Squat Jumps - 2 sets x 10 reps Have your feet next to each other a shoulder width apart and bend the knees as if you are sitting on a chair, aiming for a comfortable depth without any pain and drive through your feet and stand up. If you're feeling this is too easy and have enough head space, feel free to add a jump so that you can get a more explosive reaction from the muscles. Move celebrates exercise in all its forms, with accessible features encouraging you to add movement into your day - because it's not just good for the body, but the mind, too.

The Rotherham Advertiser and the digital version of The Argus both ran adverts placed by a reader named Stacey Bradley. Both versions of the ad prominently displayed the words 'national emergency' and 'the truth is out' on banners. They also used logos for the Metropolitan police and South Yorkshire Police, along with a fake 'crime number'. The adverts claimed they were looking for people to come forward to report 'any Covid-19 injuries or deaths'. It said 'related crimes and threats to the public health, gross negligent manslaughter and misconduct in the public office' were being investigated.  'A further 18 offences have also been cited including murder, fraud, GBH and multiple breaches of the Nuremburg Code (sic),' the ad said.  Scientists around the world have agreed that any small risks or side effects associated with the vaccines are far outweighed by the benefits. 'Billions of people have been safely vaccinated against Covid-19. All of the approved Covid-19 vaccines have been carefully tested and continue to be monitored,' the World Health Organisation says.  'Like all vaccines, Covid-19 vaccines go through a rigorous, multi-stage testing process, including large clinical trials that involve tens of thousands of people. These trials are specifically designed to identify any safety concerns.' England's Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty previously said people spreading misinformation about vaccines should be 'ashamed'.  'There are also people who go around trying to discourage other people from taking a vaccine, which could be life-saving or prevent them from having life-changing injuries to themselves,' he said during a press conference in September.  'Many of those people, I regret to say, I think know that they are peddling untruths, but they still do it. In my view, they should be ashamed.' The ASA has banned these adverts from appearing again The ASA received six complaints about the adverts and ruled that they were 'unduly alarming and caused fear of Covid-19 vaccines without justifiable reason'.  The watchdog said the references to 'threats to the public health, gross negligent manslaughter', 'murder' and 'GBH' implied vaccines are unsafe. It also called the ads 'misleading' for using police logos and crime numbers.  In response to the ASA's ruling, Stacey Bradley acknowledged the complaint and provided a link to an article in a local newspaper reporting that an individual had died after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine.  The Rotherham Advertiser, who published the print version of the advert, told the ASA that they would not run the ad or similar ads in future and that they'd assured each police force that they would not publish any ads that featured their logos without permission. However, the local paper did dispute the claim the ad was 'misleading', given that some people experienced adverse reactions to vaccines. They also believed that the ad's publication was consistent with their newspaper's commitment to offering a balanced view on current issues and said they did not believe the ad was 'harmful or irresponsible'. The Argus, which published a digital version of the advert, did not respond to the ASA's request for comment. HuffPost UK has also contacted the paper and will update the article if we receive a response.

After the brutal killing, there was seldom a company that failed to put out a statement on racism, diversity and inclusion. Many Black people and other people of colour watched on with rolled eyes. For racialised groups, these felt shallow. And new research shows not much has changed. In fact, things are still pretty dire. An astonishing 75% of women of colour say they experience racism at work, 27% say they suffered racial slurs, and more than 61% have to change themselves to fit in - with Muslim women significantly more likely to do so. The report entitled Broken Ladders, commissioned by gender equality organisation the Fawcett Society and race equality think-tank Runnymede Trust, documented the experiences of 2,000 women of colour in workplaces.  It looked at the structural racism faced by women of colour at work and of women from different religions. They found that:    50% of women of Pakistani or Bangladeshi heritage and 48% of women of Black African heritage said they had been criticised for behaviours other colleagues get away with, compared to 29% of white British women.   Black women of Caribbean heritage, and women of East Asian and Chinese heritage were the least likely to report 'often' or 'always' feeling comfortable in their workplace culture, at 43% and 41%, respectively.   Muslim women were significantly more likely to make changes to themselves at work than non-religious women or women of other religions. 53% of Muslim women changed the clothes they wear at work 'a great deal' or 'quite a bit', compared to 37% of Christian women and 32% of non-religious women.   The data reveals that institutional racism is common across all sectors and in all types of organisations and this leads to a cumulative negative impact on women of colour. As well as being subject to racism, workplace cultures mean that women of colour have to change who they are in order to fit in.  The data showed that WOC feel they have to change the language they use at work (37%), the topics they talk about (35%), their hairstyle (26%), the food they eat (28), and even their names (22%). Black women of African heritage were most likely to change by a 'a great deal' or 'quite a bit', changing their clothes (54%), the language they use (50%), the topics they talk about (46%), their hairstyle (39%), and accent (29%). Janine*, a Black woman working in communications, can relate to these sentiments. 'Looking back now, I realise that my face never seemed to fit. I was always the person that could be relied on to step up or step in to do the extra work to prepare other people for the big meetings, but never invited to those spaces on equal terms,' she says. 'With the Black Lives Matter stuff, there has been a lot of conversation and reflection at work - but what's changed? 'I've always tried to be positive to get on with things, but that fundamental lack of confidence that I've always carried, is because of my experience in education and work. 'I am a Black woman. I don't straighten my hair. I speak with a London accent. It has never been a question of my competence, but fundamentally to do with how I look and the perceptions that people have of me. 'We think that people get their jobs because of merit. People always believe that even though [it] is obviously not true.' Maliha, a disabled Bangladeshi woman, also feels the same. 'I have faced multiple challenges in being seen as a strong and competent leader, having to work hard and against the grain of the organisation to get to where I am now,' she says. 'I have had managers who were threatened by my competence and abilities.' She also witnessed white colleagues enjoying privileges she didn't. 'They were overly critical of my work, something I knew my other white colleagues didn't experience. They also appropriated my work and took credit for projects they had made little contribution to. All the Black managers were downgraded, and posts by white managers protected.' So naturally she went to HR, who were unfortunately no help. 'I remember once going to HR to seek some advice about progression and talk about my frustrations but I was told to 'hide how clever I was', as people find that easier to manage and deal with,' she says. 'Having to moderate myself to appease other people's sense of comfort was not new to me. As long as you conform to stereotypes and remained passive and compliant, you are deemed a safe and manageable employee. 'I was even was labelled as aggressive. Assertiveness is rewarded to a white man, but for me as a Muslim Bangladeshi woman, it was seen as aggressive.'  In response to these troubling results, the Fawcett Society and Runnymede are calling on the government to set-up and back a business-led initiative to tackle ethnicity and gender pay gaps and accelerate change on progression and representation. They also want the state to legislate to ban salary history questions and require salaries to be published on job advertisements. But what can employers do in the meantime? For a start, they can introduce meaningful and intersectional anti-racism training to minimise bias, with outcomes linked to organisational performance targets on diversity and inclusion. Runnymede and Fawcett also say that companies should set structures that ensure line managers deliver equitable and fair promotion outcomes for all employees and make progression routes explicit and well-known rather than based on informal networks. Additionally, they may also undertake regular 'stay interviews' (an alternative to 'exit interviews'), giving women of colour safe spaces and opportunities to feedback on their career experiences. *Names have been changed.", "a5b3260b659aeaa359dbb2dd49e4a3b50474c216b7505c696817b6e5": "", "73c7adf5ba61715a2233aa35daf6028b4c112b9f8d407194935b070d": "The government could roll-out a massive support package to ease the cost of living crisis at the same time as the potentially damaging partygate report is published.

The chancellor and the prime minister are reported to be meeting on Wednesday to thrash out the bail-out. The package could include a new windfall tax, help with fuel bills and support for the most vulnerable. The Independent reported an extension to the warm homes discount, worth hundreds of pounds to some families, could come this week. It cited a Downing Street insider saying it would provide a 'soft landing' for Boris Johnson. Critics are likely to seize on the timing of the added help, which the Labour Party has been demanding for weeks, as a 'dead cat' distraction from partygate.

Fears are growing after the head of Ofgem said the energy price cap is expected to increase by a further PS830 to PS2,800 in October. Johnson was already under renewed pressure after images obtained by ITV News showed him raising a glass while surrounded by colleagues and bottles of wine. Days after ordering England's second national lockdown, the pictures showed the prime minister giving a toast for departing communications chief Lee Cain on November 13 2020. Meanwhile, BBC Panorama on Tuesday reported Downing Street insiders describing chaotic mid-lockdown parties in No 10 they felt were condoned by Johnson as he 'was grabbing a glass for himself'. Three anonymous individuals told the programme in detail what they witnessed at regular rule-breaking events during coronavirus restrictions. At the same time, the Mirror has revealed another image which has been claimed to show another party taking place at Downing Street during the coronavirus lockdown. The newspaper has obtained a picture showing a man standing at a table with nine bottles of wine and prosecco as well as doughnuts and miniature cakes. The newspaper claims it was taken at a gathering to mark the final press briefing by Johnson's official spokesman James Slack on November 17, 2020, during England's second national coronavirus lockdown. It added that the event was allegedly attended by 30 to 40 staff and was not believed to have been investigated by Gray or the Metropolitan Police.  Meanwhile, No 10 was forced to deny that Johnson urged Gray to drop plans to publish her report in a private meeting earlier this month. The Times reported that the PM suggested to the senior civil servant that there was no longer any point in releasing her findings as the facts were 'all out there'. Johnson's official spokesman said he did not recognise 'that characterisation' of the meeting and insisted the prime minister wants the report to be published. Scotland Yard was also facing calls to explain why Johnson was not fined over that event when photos showed him, drink in hand, by a table strewn with food and wine bottles. A No 10 spokesperson said: 'As part of their investigation the Cabinet Office team were able to speak to No 10 staff to establish the facts on what happened during this period.

So it was little wonder the deputy political editor of Sky News, Sam Coates, went viral on Tuesday for his entertaining and enterprising journalism outside No 10 Downing Street following the weekly cabinet meeting. There's a long tradition of reporters bellowing questions at politicians as they emerge from the famous front door, and it can be a fairly bovine practice. But Coates, who broke the story on Friday about an undisclosed meeting between Boris Johnson and partygate report author Sue Gray, has brought some chutzpah to the role - mixing insight, humour and politeness. To Johnson: 'Did you lie at the despatch box, prime minister? Why did you try to stop Sue Gray publishing her report, prime minister?' The home secretary, who is in charge of crime, was asked: 'Do you endorse law-breaking in cabinet, Priti Patel?' Liz Truss received: 'Is partygate embarrassing on the world stage, foreign secretary?

Are you embarrassed by getting the facts wrong?' Attorney general Suella Braverman got a wry one: 'Does partygate enhance this government's reputation, Suella?', which was followed by an exchange of good mornings. Dominic Raab's holiday as Afghanistan fell was not forgotten: 'Did you discuss partygate in cabinet, deputy prime minister? Has Boris Johnson got a better grip on the government than you had on the foreign office last year?' The education's leadership ambitions were essayed: 'Did Boris Johnson lie at the dispatch box, Nadhim Zahawi? Or would you prefer to succeed him as prime minister?'

When your exercise routine has completely dropped off, getting back into it can feel intimidating. But you should know, you're really, really not alone with this.  One in three women are currently taking a 'break from exercise', according to new research by the fitness tracking app Strava and the This Girl Can campaign.  In a poll of more than 2,000 women, 35% of respondents said they were on an exercise break, with lulls in activity lasting anywhere from one month to several years. The average pause was 13 months. But the majority of women (69%) currently on a break said they wanted to restart exercise. Nine in 10 said they faced challenges and obstacles, the most common were a lack of confidence or poor body image (68%), lack of focus (39%), being judged by others (19%) and lack of support (9%). We're not going to pretend that getting back into exercise is easy, but once you overcome those hurdles, it is worth it. Here are seven small tips and pieces of advice to get you started.  1. Focus on taking part - not performance   'It doesn't matter how good or bad you are at something - it's the doing that counts,' says Kate Dale, This Girl Can's campaign lead. 'If you're taking part in getting active, then that's something to celebrate.' 2. Start small  'Start small. Try running, walking or cycling or dancing for five or 10 minutes and build up from there. It's the movement that counts - not how far or fast you go,' says Dale.  'There's no 'right' way to start exercising again after a break. Take your time and do what is right for you.' 3. Nail your schedule  Open your calendar on your phone right now and block in a time for exercise. 'When creating a workout routine, think about what suits you and your diary. Are you free on a Tuesday evening? Update your calendar and cut out some time for your all-important dose of exercise,' says May Beaufort, health and wellbeing coach at Westfield Health. 'You may want to schedule your workout sessions during quiet hours, so that they are not pushed aside by other pressing tasks or everyday duties. For instance, lunch-hour exercising can be easily 'disrupted' by work commitments, forcing you to skip your workout slot for the day. Instead, early morning sessions or after-work programmes are less likely to be disrupted.'  4. Music matters  Next time you're watching TV, make a playlist with your favourite songs and use that to help you get moving. Trust us, this one is so simple but effective.  5. Book your second session Committing to your first workout is great. Committing to your second is better. 'The key to getting back in shape is to simply keep going,' says Beaufort. 'Try not to fall into the trap of taking long breaks between one exercise session and the next, as you will ultimately end up breaking the habit.'  6. Do it for yourself Sharing your progress on social media is all well and good, but remember, you're not in this for the likes.  'Exercise for your own pleasure and motivation. In short, you shouldn't take up workout sessions just to please and impress others,' says Beaufort. 'Physical activity requires effort and dedication, and unless it is making you feel good and giving you energy, you may struggle to stick to your programme.' 7. Use your community to stay motivated  When you feel your motivation waning, you might need some friendly cheerleading. 'The This Girl Can Club on Strava will provide a supportive and judgment-free space to build women's confidence to take that first step towards getting active again,' says Dale.

But it's not clear if there will be enough energy to go around.  Here's a breakdown of how different areas will be affected, and a look into whether the UK could be impacted. Why would there be any blackouts? There are several factors at play such as the Ukraine war, the supply chain issues caused by the pandemic, climate change, and fuel shortages. 'The main risk is that if we see major blackouts on top of all the aforementioned problems this year, that could trigger some form of humanitarian crisis in terms of food and energy shortages on a scale not see in decades,' an analyst at Eurasia Group, Henning Gloystein, told US outlet Bloomberg. Russia's invasion of Ukraine triggered the west to announce various boycotts of its oil and natural gas exports in protest, reducing some countries' supplies. Even for those who haven't cut off Russia's gas supply altogether, Moscow has threatened to as tensions rise over its war in Ukraine. A lack of investment in sourcing fossil fuels elsewhere could mean some nations are about to enter a very difficult transition period before they are fully able to cope without Russia's exports, which could affect basic services like access to power. The difficulties surrounding Russia's supplies have also made it harder for poor nations to purchase such fuel, as the west's sanctions on the Kremlin mean the gas and oil price has gone up, too. Climate change also increased tension - extreme weather means there is more strain on various power grids because people are turning to use more air conditioning, and reservoirs are depleted, affecting anywhere that relies on hydropower. The pandemic means companies and businesses are trying to recover their losses after the years of lockdowns - again, putting pressure on supplies. Has anywhere already been affected? Several places are already combatting extreme weather this year, a situation only exacerbated by power outages. South Asia has struggled with blackouts stretching out for up to 10 hours a day. Pakistan, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and India have all been seriously impacted, as one billion people faced reduced power supplies. Analysis from the Met Office said the heat wave in south Asia was probably made 100 times more likely to happen by climate change, with such temperatures (at times above 45C) possibly reoccurring every three years. It triggered a spike in electricity demand in India, which depleted its coal reserves, where 70% of its energy comes from, and triggered the acute power shortage. Over in the US state of Texas, six plants failed in May, while 12 states in total could experience blackouts in the summer months, according to Bloomberg. 'The US is experiencing more outages globally than any other industrialised nation. About 70% of our grid is nearing end of life,' Teri Viswanath, lead economist at CoBank ACB, claimed. China and Japan are struggling too, while South Africa is already on track to break its own records for power cuts. What about Europe? Although Europe is less likely to experience extreme temperatures, and has significant amounts of natural gas in reserve already, it may be impacted by the shortages too. If Russia were to retaliate against the west's sanctions and cut off its natural gas supplies altogether, there could blackouts in some countries - most European nations are pushing to fill its gas stores to max capacity just in case. Spain, France and the UK probably would have adequate storage to ride out such a blip, until nations closer to Moscow, such as Hungary and Latvia, which are more reliant on the Russian exports. Could the UK have another problem on the horizon? The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport workers (RMT) could vote to strike this summer, meaning freight trains supplying critical power plants would be severely disrupted. This would affect the electricity feeds to millions. Tesco and Puma energy could find themselves struggling to supply garage forecourts as the RMT considers striking over pay and staff cuts from late June onwards. The RMT has balloted 40,000 members, and the results could be released on Wednesday morning. However, even if the strike does go through, contingency plans would still allow some trains to run.", "869abeb3924866ab324bf370f961aa4693fdc31020c1e39e913f7e5f": "ITV has confirmed the launch date for the upcoming eighth season of Love Island. The news was revealed in a tweet on Tuesday afternoon, with bosses confirming there's just less than two weeks to go until the Bafta-winning reality show's return. 'Here's your first hot date for the summer,' the show joked in a tweet, before announcing the show would return on Monday 6 June at 9pm on ITV2. A new teaser for the forthcoming series, featuring some of Love Island's most meme-worthy moments ever, aired for the first time earlier this month, with the slogan: 'Love is ours.' Following an extended break due to Covid, Love Island returned to our screens for its seventh run last summer, with Millie Court and Liam Reardon being crowned the winning couple. Finalists Faye Winter and Teddy Soares are also still together, as are Chloe Burrows and Toby Aromolaran. While the new series is expected to be pretty much business as usual, with Laura Whitmore and Iain Stirling returning as host and narrator, there will be a few small changes this time around. For one thing, the show will be moving to a brand new villa after four years at its previous location. It was also recently announced that Love Island was ditching its fast-fashion tie-ins, instead opting for a new deal with eBay which will see the Islanders sporting 'pre-loved' ensembles during their time on the show.

Laura Kuenssberg, the corporations's former political editor, spoke to three insiders who had been present at some of the parties, two of whom have been fined by the police. They revealed how breaking the Covid rules the prime minister had drawn up himself was commonplace, with alcohol-fuelled lockdown-busting gatherings taking place on a regular basis throughout the pandemic. Here are the five new revelations uncovered by the bombshell investigation. 1) Boris Johnson regularly attended parties One staffer told the programme they believed the PM had given 'permission' for the parties to take place because he was a regular participant in the revelry. 'He was there,' they said. 'He may have just been popping through on the way to his flat because that's what would happen. You know, he wasn't there saying 'this shouldn't be happening'. He wasn't saying, 'can everyone break up and go home? Can everyone socially distance? Can everyone put masks on?' No, he wasn't telling anybody that. He was grabbing a glass for himself.' They also told of their disbelief when Johnson repeatedly claimed there had been no parties inside No. 10. 'We were watching it all live and we just sort of looked at each other in disbelief like - why? Why is he denying this?' 2) Security guard mocked for trying to break up a party One Downing Street insider told the programme how staff had 'made fun' of a security guard when they tried to stop a party in full flow.   'I remember when a custodian tried to stop it all and he was just shaking his head in this party, being like, 'This shouldn't be happening'.    'People made fun of him because he was so worked up that this party was happening and it shouldn't be happening.' On the night before Prince Philip's funeral, a Number 10 party became so loud that security guards told those present to leave the building and go into garden.     'So everyone grabbed all the drinks, the food, everything, and went into the garden,' one source said. 'We all sat around the tables drinking. People stayed the night there.'     3) Wine Time Fridays Parties were a weekly occurrence throughout lockdown, according to the programme, with 'wine time Fridays' - so much so that an invite marked 'WTF' was in the Number 10 press team's diaries.  'We saw it as our own bubble,' one insider told Panorama. The weekly gatherings 'became a lifeline during the pandemic, particularly if you were sort of living alone on Fridays to have this chance to, work at your desk and drink together', said one eyewitness. Another attendee said 'it was not unusual for the prime minister to be there' because 'he seemed to be a believer in letting his staff let their hair down a little bit'.    4) Bins overflowing with empty bottles  Insiders who spoke to the programme describe how they would arrive for work the morning after a get-together to find the detritus left behind from a party the night before. One former official said they turned up in Number 10 to find 'a mess - there were bottles, empties, rubbish - in the bin, but overflowing - or indeed sometimes left on the table'. 5) People sitting on each other's laps at Lee Cain's leaving party Strict social distancing rules were routinely ignored inside No. 10, according to the programme. At the now notorious leaving party for Lee Cain, the former Downing Street director of communications, at which the prime minister was pictured holding a drink and making a speech, dozens of revellers were present. 'There were about 30 people, if not more, in a room,' one person present said. Everyone was stood shoulder to shoulder, some people on each other's laps...one or two people.'", "42f7eb8866e346845fd3ea3ec95d4bb9b377273545478d912fcfacc6": "Monkeypox cases have suddenly spiked with 71 confirmed cases in the UK as of Tuesday and 145 worldwide. Although the virus was first detected decades ago, this sudden outbreak has caused some alarm, especially as many cases (but not all) have been reported among men who have sex with men. Here's why experts think case numbers have surged in recent weeks - and why the virus has nothing to do with sexual orientation. What is monkeypox? Monkeypox is a rare virus often compared to smallpox, although it is significantly milder and less deadly. Endemic in some west and central African countries, monkeypox can cause muscle aches, fever, chills, swollen lymph nodes, exhaustion and weakness, but most notably it usually triggers a rash across the skin. This then develops into painful sores before scabbing over. The scabs will fall off but may leave a scar behind. The virus usually starts to clear up on its own, and most people recover from monkeypox within two to four weeks without any long-lasting health implications. It spreads through close physical contact and sharing infected items such as bedding, clothing and utensils. The strain which has started to spread across Europe, Australia and North America has a low fatality rate of 1% according to Reuters news agency. There have been no deaths reported from this outbreak so far and there is no evidence to suggest this strain had mutated into a more infectious form as yet. So, what has triggered this outbreak? The exact details surrounding this outbreak's origins remain uncertain at the moment. As the disease is endemic in animals in Africa, the virus' spread to other parts of the world has surprised experts. World Health Organisation (WHO) director for Global Infectious Hazard Preparedness, Sylvie Briand, has suggested it has been driven by a return to socialising as the Covid restrictions are lifted around the world. A different leading adviser to WHO came up with a more specific idea, speculating that it could be traced back to two large events in Europe.  Dr David Heymann, the former head of WHO's emergencies department, told the Associated Press that there is a theory the virus spread through sexual transmission at raves in Spain and Belgium.  He said: 'We know monkeypox can spread when there is close contact with the lesions of someone who is infected, and it looks like sexual contact has now amplified that transmission.' WHO has warned that, as cases have been reported across so many countries at the same time, that the virus may have been silently spreading for a short while - and it could be accelerated by more festivals and parties this summer. Heymann also speculated that the outbreak could be traced back to a single infection. 'It's very possible there was somebody who got infected, developed lesions on the genitals, hands or somewhere else, and then spread it to others when there was sexual or close, physical contact,' he said. 'And then there were these international events that seeded the outbreak around the world, into the US and other European countries.' Are men who have sex with men at higher risk? No - anyone can catch monkeypox. The majority of known cases so far have been among men who have sex with men who went to sexual health clinics after spotting their lesions, but anyone who is in close contact with an infected individual - and that includes their clothing or bedding - can be infected as well. Those at a higher risk of contracting monkeypox are actually children under the age of five, pregnant people and the immunocompromised, according to the infection registrar Jamie Murphy, who created a Twitter thread about the disease. If it's not an STI, why is it linked to sex? Experts have also been clear to differentiate that monkeypox spreads through close physical contact (which can include sex) but is not at the moment classified as a sexually transmitted infection. Mike Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, told AP: 'By nature, sexual activity involves intimate contact, which one would expect to increase the likelihood of transmission, whatever a person's sexual orientation and irrespective of the mode of transmission.' Similarly, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control director, Andrea Ammon, said earlier this week: 'The likelihood of further spread of the virus through close contact, for example, during sexual activities among persons with multiple sexual partners, is considered to be high.' Germany has reported four confirmed cases connected to exposure at 'party events' where 'sexual activity took place' in Spain's Canary Islands and in Berlin, according to a government report for lawmakers obtained by AP. Meanwhile, Spain's health minister Enrique Ruiz Escudero said the authorities are also looking into links between a Gay Pride event in the Canary Islands where there were 80,000 people, and cases stemming from a Madrid sauna. Is there wider cause for concern right now? Heymann reminded AP that 'this is not Covid', as monkeypox does not spread in the air and the smallpox vaccine has been shown to provide 85% protection against it. This jab is already being offered to healthcare staff looking after monkeypox cases and to those exposed to confirmed cases, according to AP. But, Heymann suggested that studies should be conducted quickly to find if it could be spread by people without symptoms, and how those at risk of the disease should be protected. The WHO has repeatedly said the virus is 'containable', although WHO's Briand said experts were not sure if it was 'the tip of the iceberg' or if the peak had already passed. If you think you have monkeypox ... You'll have to do a PCR test similar to the Covid test. For monkeypox, it involves three swabs, two for the skin, and a throat swab.  You are still allowed to travel on public transport if you suspect monkeypox, but wear a mask and cover any lesions. If you need to isolate, do not share a bathroom if you can avoid it and isolate in one room. Make sure not to share bedding or towels, avoid contact with your pets and have no sexual contact. Try to avoid other communal spaces, too, like the kitchen.", "6a55fa0670d2c4f115a1c95b41dc6c219f3c2808720da703ccb9bb10": "Sadiq Khan has written to the Metropolitan Police seeking a 'detailed explanation' as to why Boris Johnson was not fined for attending a leaving party in Downing Street during lockdown. A photograph obtained by ITV News showed the prime minister raising a glass while stood behind a table littered with wine bottles and food on November 13, 2020. Others who attended the bash, held for departing communications director Lee Cain, were issued fixed penalty notices. But Johnson was not. In a letter sent to acting Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Stephen House on Tuesday, Khan said Scotland Yard risked undermining public trust in the police. A spokesperson for the London mayor said: 'Sadiq has today written to the acting commissioner of the Met to seek a detailed explanation of the factors which were taken into account by investigating officers when decisions were made about whether to take action in individual cases in the Downing Street 'partygate' investigation. 'He has asked them to take steps to also reassure Londoners by making this explanation to them directly, because he is concerned that the trust and confidence of Londoners in the police is being further eroded by this lack of clarity. 'The mayor has been clear he cannot and would not intervene in operational decisions, however with the investigation now complete, he has made this request in accordance with the Policing Protocol Order 2011 paragraph 23(g).' The photographs show at least eight people standing close together. Eight days earlier, Johnson had imposed England's second national lockdown.

Not only does bum pain suck, it can take on many forms and significantly affect your day-to-day functioning.  'If the pain is showing up in the glute muscle area, it can be perceived as tightness or stiffness, shooting pains, cramping or a nagging ache,' Amanda Shipley, a pelvic physical therapist based in Georgia, tells HuffPost.  'Anus, rectum or tailbone-area pain, meanwhile, can be felt as an itching, burning, searing pain or spasm that varies from mild to intense.' Besides the discomfort and inconvenience of the physical pain, which can affect your ability to do important activities, such as standing, walking and exercising, it can be embarrassing and stressful to have to deal with the symptoms as well. 'The pelvic floor and genital region is such a taboo area to talk about and acknowledge in our society,' Shipley says. 'This adds to the unnecessary shame we might feel when we need help in this area.'  In non-emergency situations, a physical therapy evaluation can help determine the root cause of your gluteal pain and whether symptoms need to be addressed through a physiotherapist or doctor. Fortunately, once you have the right treatment plan and health care professionals in place, bum pain conditions are highly treatable. So what might be causing your rear to act up? Below are some of the most likely culprits, according to experts. 1. Gluteal amnesia Street name: dead bum syndrome, or DBS. 'We experience DBS most commonly by prolonged sitting,' says Dallas Reynolds, a physical therapist at ATI Physical Therapy in Illinois. 'When we sit for long periods of time, our hip flexors get tight, and glute muscles get weak and sleepy.' This can cause pesky symptoms like soreness or numbness in your backside, along with hip pain and stiffness - symptoms you'll most likely notice when trying to stand up after a lengthy sitting session. One of the best ways to turn things around is to surround yourself with opportunities to sit for shorter lengths of time and switch up where you sit, both of which keep the muscles in your buttocks and lower back engaged. You might do this by investing in a standing desk, setting a timer to remind yourself to get up and stretch every hour and sprinkling in to-do list tasks that require movement throughout your day instead of batching them together. Reynolds also recommended establishing an exercise routine you can perform to stretch your hip flexors and activate your glute muscles to keep them healthy and strong. (Try these moves, courtesy of the Cleveland Clinic.) 'If after making these changes in your daily routine you see no change or your symptoms begin to worsen, you should check in with your doctor for a consult,' Reynolds says. 2. Sciatica The sciatic nerve runs from your lower back, down through your buttocks and all the way to your feet. 'Sciatica is a term used to describe a radiating pain that runs along the path of the sciatic nerve and can be felt in the lower back, glute area and legs,' Reynolds said. 'Sciatic pain is felt when the sciatic nerve becomes irritated or inflamed, often from disc or spine issues, along with muscular dysfunction in the glute area.' The pain that strikes can range anywhere from a mild ache to excruciating pain. It can also resemble a jolt or electric shock. Usually only one side of your body is affected, and things like coughing, sneezing and sitting for prolonged periods can make symptoms worse, according to the Mayo Clinic. You might experience numbness, tingling or muscle weakness, too, because of reduced nerve function. 'Nerve glide exercises are an effective way to mobilize the nerve and its ability to move more freely,' Reynolds says. 'This will reduce irritation and should be performed often throughout the day.' Mild sciatica usually goes away over time. 'Check in with your doctor if you see no change or symptoms begin to worsen over time,' Reynolds says. 'You should also seek medical attention immediately if you experience increased or sudden loss of leg strength or difficulty walking.' 3. Piriformis Syndrome Piriformis syndrome is a condition in which the piriformis muscle (located behind your gluteus maximus) can become tight and irritated. 'This can cause pain in the glute area and sciatica-type symptoms,' Reynolds says. 'Sciatica isn't always related to piriformis syndrome, but often piriformis syndrome can result in sciatica.' The piriformis muscle sits over the top of the sciatic nerve, so if the muscle becomes irritated, it can press down on the sciatic nerve and cause glute pain, along with radiating pain down the leg. 'You might also find symptoms worsen with prolonged sitting,' Reynolds says. Getting into a stretching routine that helps reduce compression on the sciatic nerve can be a helpful pain relief strategy, as can the previously mentioned nerve glide exercises. You can also talk to your doctor about medications that can address inflammation and nerve-based symptoms. And if these changes don't make a difference or symptoms get worse, you know the drill. 4. Bursitis Bursitis in the hip is when the bursa sac - the fluid sac that reduces friction between the moving part of our joints - becomes inflamed. Though bursitis may be caused by trauma, infection or sustained pressure on the bursa, it's most commonly associated with overuse or repetitive or strenuous activity. 'What's usually happening is certain muscles of the hip are tight and others are weak,' Reynolds says. 'This imbalance causes more pressure and friction on the bursa than what it's built for and results in irritation and inflammation.' The result? Pain surrounding the bursa, often including the gluteal muscles in the area. Along with pain in the glute area, you may experience warmth, tenderness and swelling, 'mostly on the outside, bony part of the hip,' Reynolds says. The best first step to relieving this particular brand of bum pain is stopping or modifying the activity that's causing the bursitis and focusing on pain management and inflammation reduction, such as applying ice or popping an NSAID pain reliever. (Always check with your doctor before beginning any new medication, Reynolds says.) As the pain starts to subside, slowly reintroduce activities and gauge the body's response. 'This could include starting with a walking routine with the addition of a light stretching and strengthening routine,' Reynolds says. 'The focus here would be to address recovery from the current bursitis episode and prevent future episodes.' 5. Haemorrhoids Haemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels that form on the anus and rectum, according to the US National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. There are two types: internal and external, with external usually the culprit for haemorrhoid-related bum pain. 'External haemorrhoids are very obvious - they can easily be seen and felt on the outside of the anus,' says Dr Stephanie Pannell, a colorectal surgeon and assistant professor of surgery at the University of Toledo. 'They're usually painful for a few days and slowly resolve over the next week or two.' Haemorrhoids usually go away on their own, but, in the meantime, over-the-counter haemorrhoid creams can offer relief. So does sitting in a tub of warm water. Internal haemorrhoids are usually caused by spending too much time on the toilet, whether from diarrhoea or constipation, so they can be more of a long-term issue. 'If they're bleeding, you should be evaluated by a physician,' Pannell says. 'Any type of rectal bleeding needs to be seen by a physician.' 6. Anal fissures Anal fissures are small tears in the tissues surrounding the anus. They usually happen as a result of passing a large, hardened stool and overstretching the anal opening. 'Patients describe anal fissures as feeling severe pain with bowel movements and possibly seeing small streaks of blood on the toilet paper,' Pannell says. To top it off, the anal sphincter will contract once the skin is irritated on the outside. 'This is an involuntary muscle, so even with bowel movements, the muscle will not relax,' Pannell says. 'It makes the tear larger and bowel movements very painful.' Anal fissures typically heal on their own and don't require treatment. Things like upping your fibre and water intake and using stool softeners can be helpful in preventing them - but if yours won't quit or they happen frequently, treatment is best done by your doctor, who can also make sure they're not caused by an underlying condition, such as Crohn's disease. 7. Anal abscesses 'Anal abscesses are very painful and usually present as a hard, sometimes red, tender area around the anus,' Pannell says. Fever is another common symptom. Rectal bleeding and trouble peeing - such as trouble initiating a urinary stream or painful urination -- may also be present, according to the American Society of Colon & Rectal Surgeons, or ASCRS. In most cases, treatment of an anal abscess involves surgical drainage. Your doctor will make an incision to drain the infection, with the end goal to ease the pressure and let the tissue heal. This can either be done at your doctor's office or in an operating room if the infection is more severe. 8. Levator Ani Syndrome Levator ani are the deep pelvic floor muscles, with levator ani syndrome referring to when these muscles are too tight and poorly coordinated (you have difficulty with things like contracting and relaxing them). You might experience episodic pain and pressure in the rectum, lower spine or tailbone that lasts for hours or days. The pain usually feels dull or achy and may feel worse when sitting or lying down, according to the ASCRS. 'Immediate relief can be found with NSAIDs or more natural options like arnica montana and by applying heat or ice to the area,' Shipley says. 'However, this pain can come on very suddenly, and if you're on a call or in a meeting, you can't always grab an ice pack to sit on.' A pelvic physical therapist can do a thorough evaluation to determine the root cause of the pain (levator ani syndrome is considered a diagnosis of exclusion) to help alleviate your symptoms. Massage with a combination of heat and muscle relaxants has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms in up to 90% of patients, according to the ASCRS. 9. Proctalgia Fugax 'Proctalgia fugax is just a fancy term that means sharp, painful spasms in the anus and rectum,' Shipley says. It may be diagnosed after a careful history and a thorough examination has been performed to rule out more serious causes of rectal pain. Muscle relaxants may provide some relief from the intermittent discomfort, but ultimately treatment by a pelvic physical therapist is best to help alleviate your current pain and teach you how to minimise future flare-ups. 10. Menstruation Some people who menstruate experience severe cramps that can cause pain in the rectum. 'When the uterus contracts to expel menstrual tissue, it can cause adjacent nerves to activate and cause pain in what most consider unusual areas,' says Dr Jennifer Roelands, an OB-GYN in Missouri. (This can happen with sex as well, she added: 'Irritating the pelvic floor can cause spasms of these nerves, leading to severe pain in the pelvis, including the rectum, a condition called vaginismus.') There's also endometriosis, a condition in which tissue that normally lines the uterus (the same tissue that sheds during your period) grows outside of it -- any tissue growth that happens behind the uterus can often cause rectal pain, Roelands said. Endo pain is often accompanied by bloating, moodiness, irregular periods, infertility and sometimes digestive issues. 'If you have butt pain that seems associated with the same time in your cycle, get evaluated by a doctor for endometriosis,' Roelands said. 'There are a variety of natural, prescription and surgical treatments available, but a proper exam and diagnosis need to happen first.' 11. Fibroids Uterine fibroids are masses that grow in the wall of the uterus. They can be as small as a grain of rice or as large as a grapefruit, with larger fibroids causing bum pain by pressing on the rectum or pelvic nerves. 'Associated symptoms include heavy, painful -- and sometimes irregular --periods,' Roelands said. 'Treatment is often surgical but requires an exam, ultrasound and discussion of the right treatment options with your doctor.' Does colorectal cancer cause bum pain? 'Colon and rectal cancer are usually asymptomatic until the disease is advanced,' Pannell said. 'Bleeding may be the first sign, which is why all rectal bleeding should be seen and discussed with your physician.'", "9dd65d709a1cf769498f934339f89b0d96c646a6cedbb1f545db088b": "Gemma Collins has been forced to pull out of her upcoming appearance in a touring production of Chicago a week before her planned stage debut due to an injury. Earlier this year, it was announced that The GC would be appearing in the tour in the role of Mama Morton, the character portrayed by Queen Latifah in the Oscar-winning film adaptation of Chicago. However, it was confirmed on Tuesday that Gemma was bowing out of the tour due to a previous knee injury which was reportedly exacerbated by her fall on Dancing On Ice in 2018. A spokesperson for the show told The Sun: 'Gemma Collins' management have informed the producers of Chicago she will no longer be appearing in the UK tour of the show due to a knee injury. 'The producers of Chicago wish Gemma all the best for the future.' Although she is yet to comment publicly on her departure from Chicago, Gemma did share footage of herself receiving cryotherapy treatment on her knee on her Instagram story on Tuesday morning.

Tugendhat is the latest senior Tory to make clear their dissatisfaction with Johnson since the partygate pictures were revealed.  On Monday evening, Steve Baker tweeted an NHS Covid campaign poster urging people to obey lockdown rules.  Baker, who was pivotal in bringing down Theresa May over Brexit, posted the image of a woman breathing through an oxygen mask with the message: 'Look into her eyes and tell her you never bend the rules.'  Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross - another who had urged Johnson to go -demanded the prime minister explain why he believes his behaviour was 'acceptable' when most will think the pictures 'seem unjustifiable and wrong'.   His predecessor, Ruth Davidson, went further by saying Johnson should resign.

MPs on the Commons foreign affairs committee demanded that Philip Barton consider his position following the publication of its report which found that Afghan allies and British soldiers were 'utterly let down by deep failures of leadership' during the evacuation of Kabul. The report, published on Tuesday, took aim at Barton and then foreign secretary Dominic Raab for remaining on holiday while the capital fell to the Taliban. The MPs said their decision showed a 'fundamental lack of seriousness, grip or leadership' and that the overall withdrawal was a 'disaster' and a 'betrayal' of Britain's allies. But asked what the prime minister made of the report's findings, his official spokesman said: 'We don't agree with all of the conclusions that the committee has drawn on this. 'Foreign Office staff and government staff more widely worked tirelessly, evacuating 15,000 People from Afghanistan in 14 days. It was the biggest UK mission of its kind.' Asked if Johnson still has confidence in Barton, the spokesman replied: 'Yes'. In a withering assessment, the committee said Barton 'displayed a worrying lack of knowledge of the department he leads' and a determination to avoid unearthing the facts. His decision not to return to Kabul until after the civilian evacuation was over was 'difficult to understand and impossible to excuse'. It meant other staff had to implement a 'poorly planned evacuation process under intense pressure', the MPs said. 'The hasty effort to select those eligible for evacuation was poorly devised, managed, and staffed; and the department failed to perform the most basic crisis-management functions. 'The lack of clarity led to confusion and false hope among our Afghan partners who were desperate for rescue. 'They, and the many civil servants and soldiers working hard on the evacuation, were utterly let down by deep failures of leadership in government.' The report added: 'It is the responsibility of the permanent under-secretary to ensure that this system operates effectively. 'The committee has lost confidence in the permanent under-secretary, who should consider his position.' Barton previously expressed regret at his decision to not return from holiday but has so far refused to resign. Asked by the foreign affairs committee in December why he chose to go on holiday on August 9 -- just days before the Taliban takeover -- Barton said: 'When I went on leave, including on the ninth, there was no inevitability at that point that Kabul was going to fall in the period that it fell in. 'The best assessment was that it could take some time. There was no certainty over the timescale. 'It is quite usual, actually, for secretaries of state and permanent secretaries to be away in periods which are usually holiday periods.'  Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the committee, said: 'The UK's part in this tragedy exposes a lack of seriousness in achieving coordination, a lack of clear decision-making, a lack of leadership and a lack of accountability. 'While junior officials demonstrated courage and integrity, chaotic and arbitrary decision-making runs through this inquiry. 'Sadly, it may have cost many people the chance to leave Afghanistan, putting lives in danger.' Elsewhere in the report, the MPs suggested that Johnson was behind the 'mysterious intervention' that led to staff from the Nowzad animal welfare charity being evacuated from Afghanistan. Downing Street has repeatedly denied that the prime minister played any role in prioritising the evacuation of Nowzad's staff, but the Foreign Affairs Committee said 'multiple senior officials' believed he had and added: 'We have yet to be offered a plausible alternative explanation.'", "25889d34c16770e2106031d60690241706d3332937f0857216ef72db": "BBC News has apologised after viewers spotted some slightly strange messages flashing up on their ticker on Tuesday morning. During the live broadcast, unusual messages including 'Manchester United are rubbish' and 'Weather: rain everywhere' flashed up on screen during the news, alongside regular headlines about the more serious news of the day. The messages did not go unnoticed by viewers, who were left questioning exactly what was going on behind the scenes: Well, a couple of hours later, the BBC offered up an explanation (and an apology to fans of Manchester United). 'A little earlier some of you might have noticed something pretty unusual on the ticker that runs along the bottom of the screen with news, making a comment about Manchester United,' their anchor explained. 'And I hope that Manchester United fans weren't offended by it. Let me just explain what was happening. 'Behind the scenes, someone was training to learn how to use the ticker, and to put text on the ticker, so they were just writing random things, not in earnest. And that comment appeared. 'So, apologies if you saw that and you were offended, and you're a fan of Manchester United, but certainly that was a mistake, and it wasn't meant to appear on the screen. So that was what happened, we just thought we'd better explain that to you.' A BBC spokesperson added: 'There was a technical glitch during training with our test ticker, which rolled over to live programming for a few seconds. We apologised for any offence caused on air.' This isn't the first time in recent history that BBC News has given its viewers an unintentional laugh, though.

The cap is the maximum price that suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge households. At the moment it is PS1,971. Last October the cap was PS1,277. Speaking to MPs on Tuesday, Jonathan Brearley said the surge in energy prices was 'very distressing' for people but warned they were set to rise even more. 'I am afraid to say conditions have worsened in the global gas market since Russia's invasion of Ukraine,' he said. 'Gas prices are higher and highly volatile. At times they have now reached over 10 times their normal level.' He added: 'We are expecting a price cap in October in the region of PS2,800. 'The price changes we have seen in the gas market are genuinely a once-in-a-generation event not seen since the oil crisis of the 1970s.'

The Hollywood star made the revelation in David Letterman's Netflix series My Next Guest Needs No Introduction. The actor made headlines around the world when he went up on stage during the Academy Awards and slapped Chris, who was presenting, after the comic made a joke about his wife Jada Pinkett-Smith. Following the shocking incident, the actor resigned from the Academy and was subsequently banned from appearing at any Oscar events for 10 years. Speaking about his experiences with ayahuasca - a powerful psychedelic drug taken in liquid form - the star said that the substance had started his 'spiritual journey'. 'You're not hallucinating,' he explained. 'It's like both realities are 100 per cent present... There's what's going on in your head and what's going on in the room. 'Once you drink it, you're gonna see yourself in a way you've never seen yourself.' Will then described one particular trip, which he called 'the individual most hellish psychological experience of my life'. 'I'm drinking, I'm sitting there, and then all of a sudden, it's like I start seeing all of my money flying away and my house is flying away and my career is gone away,' he recalled. 'I'm trying to grab for my money and my career and my whole life is getting destroyed.' Asked by Letterman if this represented his real-life fears, Will agreed. 'I hear a voice saying, 'This is what the fuck it is. This is what the fuck life is.' And I'm going, 'Oh shit',' he said. Will added that, during the trip, he then heard his daughter Willow crying out for help, but he couldn't get to her. With the shaman's help, he began to relax. 'Then slowly, I stopped caring about money. I just wanted to get to Willow,' he said. 'I stopped caring about my house, I stopped caring about my career... when I came out of it, I realised that anything that happens in my life, I can handle it.'

Earlier this month, Nick issued a statement to the press which read: 'With much sadness, I can confirm that my son, Jethro, has passed away. We would be grateful for family privacy at this time.' In a new update on his blog The Red Hand Files, the Australian musician took a moment to thank his supporters for their well-wishes in the wake of Jethro's death. One fan wrote on the site: 'I just wanted to send my heartfelt condolences on the tragic loss of Jethro. All I can do is offer the collective love of all who read your letters. Much love to you and all your family.' The rock singer then responded: 'Thank you for your letter. Many others have written to me about Jethro, sending condolences and kind words. 'These letters are a great source of comfort and I'd like to thank all of you for your support.' Jethro, a former actor, model and photographer, was born in Australia in 1991. He previously revealed that he did not meet his musician father until he was 'about seven'. Earlier this year, he was arrested and taken into police custody after a physical assault on his mother, Beau Lazenby, in Melbourne, Australia. His legal representative, Sean Ghattas, said Jethro had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, which had affected his judgement. It was reported at the time that the 31-year-old had been released from custody two days before his death, on the condition he undergo substance abuse treatment and not contact his mother for the next two years. Nick lost another son, Arthur, in 2015 after he fell to his death from a cliff in Brighton when he was 15 years old. Last year, the singer revealed that he and his wife, model Susie Bick, had relocated to Los Angeles, stating that it had become 'too sad' for them to stay in Brighton. Speaking to The Guardian in 2017, Nick said of the grieving process: 'It's hard to know what to say that is helpful. People often say they can't imagine how it would feel to lose a child, but, actually, they can - they can imagine what it is like. 'A lot is said about grief, especially the conventional wisdom that you do it alone. I personally have found that not to be the case. The goodwill we received after Arthur's death from people who I did not know, especially through social media, people who liked my music and kind of reached out, was extraordinary.'", "3702b7d41af709fe3dc9f7ef90202a681d7764d6197c1a2094e179ea": "Photos of Boris Johnson making a toast during a lockdown gathering in No.10 were leaked on Monday - sending Twitter into a rage. The damaging images were obtained by ITV News and were published ahead of the full partygate report from senior civil servant Sue Gray, although this is expected later this week. The pictures also came just days after the Metropolitan Police confirmed that its investigation into the Downing Street parties had concluded after issuing 126 fines, one of which went to Johnson for attending a party in June 2020. But, these images appear to show the prime minister breaching the lockdown rules again, on November 13 2020 - meaning it was not the event he received a fine for. This occasion was meant to honour the departing communications chief Lee Cain, and it took place just days after the government had ordered a second national lockdown in England. A No.10 spokesperson allegedly told ITV News: 'The Cabinet Office and the Met Police have had access to all information relevant to their investigations, including photographs. 'The Met have concluded their investigation and Sue Gray will publish her report in the coming days, at which point the prime minister will address parliament in full.' From the moment ITV News shared the photos, Twitter users went into a spiral of frustration and disbelief. Some just couldn't believe the excuse that the prime minister might have unintentionally joined such a gathering without knowing it was breaking the rules - Johnson used this defence to explain away his presence at his own birthday party in June that same year. A former Labour aide Tom Hamilton also speculated that the prime minister's defence this time was going to revolve around the way he replied to queries about this gathering last December. Labour MP Catherine West asked Johnson if he could say whether a party occurred on November 13, 2020 in the Commons. He replied: 'No, but I'm sure whatever happened the guidance and the rules were followed at all times.' Hamilton suggested Johnson would claim his reply of 'no' was to the first part of the question, rather than a denial that a party actually happened. Others reminded their followers about all the lengths Johnson went to discourage other people from partying throughout the various lockdowns. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner also retrieved a Covid campaign poster which reminded people not to break lockdown rules. She tweeted: 'What if that one person was the prime minister? What if he made the rules he broke?' And there were the inevitable questions about what counts for a breach of the lockdown rules in the eyes of the Met. Others questioned why the length of time the prime minister was present at this gathering mattered at all when it came to explaining why he was not fined. Some took on the barbs the prime minister normally aims at his critics and sarcastically used it to describe the photo. And it seems few were impressed with transport secretary Grant Shapps' attempts to defend Johnson over the photo leak. Then there were some more flippant responses to the quality of the photos released - the other people in the image were blurred, presumably to protect their identity - and Twitter jumped on the opportunity:", "5466b1960f155bf59ebb7daa869d2a5615b83a8acf2a2838d52d53ed": "Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz have unveiled their British Vogue magazine cover, appearing in their wedding attire on the front of the iconic fashion magazine. The UK publication had exclusive rights to the young couple's big day last month, where they tied the knot at Nicola's family home in Florida. While the first photos from what Vogue has described as the 'wedding of the year' were first posted on the magazine's social media accounts days after the ceremony, their accompanying cover has now been revealed. Alongside the romantic photo-shoot, the newlyweds also spoke to Vogue about how their nuptials played out on the day. 'The highlight of the whole wedding for me was seeing her for the first time in that dress,' Brooklyn told the outlet. 'It was the first time ever in my life when I felt like I couldn't catch my breath.' When asked whether they were inspired by David and Victoria Beckham's lavish wedding back in the 90s, Nicola explained: 'Their wedding was incredible and those pictures are iconic, but the wedding we were most inspired by was Iman and David Bowie's.' The pair also opened up about their first meeting at the Coachella music festival, with Nicola admitting: 'We didn't get along at first.' It was previously revealed that, as a surprise, Nicola's mum had included a 'something blue' message to be stitched into the skirt of her gown, which read: 'Nicola, my heart. You are me, I am you. All my love, all my life, my beautiful girl, inside and out.' Without Nicola's knowledge, her mum also instructed that an evil eye to ward off bad energy be stitched into the dress. 'I'm happy she showed that to me after the ceremony because I just burst into tears,' Nicola explained.

That these numbers have 'improved' marginally - Black women are now four times more likely to die during labour, according to the most recent MBRACE report - only highlights the dire inequality of the situation. Today the campaign group Five X More, set up by two Black British mothers in 2019 to address this inequality, has released new research, which finds that racism is part and parcel of the health risks faced by Black mums-to-be. Black women report both discrimination and a mixed level of maternity care during the antenatal, labour, and postnatal period, according to the Five X More Black Maternity Experiences survey, which is being presented at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists on Tuesday. One respondent said of her prenatal appointments: 'I'd turn up in a tracksuit and be spoken to in a certain (dismissive) way until they learnt I was a lawyer... and they would be more respectful overall in my experience.' Another said of her labour: 'One midwife said that the reason for dilation taking so long for me was 'probably due to an African pelvis' - even though I was on pain relief. I was mortified that she actually believed there was such a thing as an African pelvis.' More than a third (36%) of respondents reported feeling dissatisfied with how their concerns were addressed by healthcare professionals during labour. Tinuke Awe, co-founder of Five X More, said: 'The findings in this report highlight the urgent work needed to ensure that rapid improvements are made because a positive birthing experience is deserved not just by some, but by all.' Awe said that while previous studies highlighted the 'striking disparity' between Black and white women's experience of maternity, the reasons for that difference have remained unclear, which is what prompted the report. The group surveyed 1,340 women and birthing people from around the UK, who either identified as Black or of Black mixed heritage and had accessed NHS maternity services while pregnant between 2016 and 2021. 'Despite the stark disparities in maternal outcomes, Black women's voices and lived experiences have been notably absent from literature to date,' said Awe. The report was also important, she stressed, as it showed the poorer health outcomes Black women face aren't always due to socio-economic status. 'A lot of people who have responded back to our study earn above the national average, are degree level educated and married, so it isn't always about a women's socio-economic status,' Awe told HuffPost UK, Instead, it shines a light on the 'assumptions, knowledge and attitudes' of health professionals, she said. In August 2020, HuffPost UK and Black Ballad exposed similarly shocking instances of healthcare racism endangering Black mothers, following a Five x More petition to address the issue. The petition attracted more than 187,000 signatures and led to a parliamentary debate in April 2021.  'The Five X More campaign wasn't very well received at all until the Black Lives Matter movement happened,' Awe told reporter Nadine White at the time. 'I'm so happy that we've finally been able to raise awareness and get the message out there but it's a shame it took the televised murder of George Floyd for more people to start having this conversation.'   Of the new research, Awe tells HuffPost UK: 'It's a report that is completely led by Black women and for Black women. We have an all Black expert panel [at the launch] - and we just want to show people this is how it's done properly. 'We delve into the kind of information given, in order to make informed decisions about our care. We delve into complaints and the standard of care given to Black women, asking them about their lived experiences.  'And at the end of our survey, we actually asked them what they want to see changed in maternity care to help improve their experiences.' Five X More's findings also follow the publication on Monday of a year-long investigation by the charity Birthrights, in which more than 300 people gave evidence to a panel chaired by the barrister Shaheen Rahman QC. The Birthrights report, entitled Systemic Racism, not Broken Bodies, found that racial discrimination in maternity care is harming both Black and Asian women, and women of mixed ethnicity - and highlighted the need for urgent action, including training for health care professionals that focused on diversity. Women repeatedly reported feeling 'unsafe', being denied pain relief, and facing racial stereotyping about their pain tolerance. Other common experiences that emerged included:    Healthcare professionals failing to recognise serious medical conditions, such as jaundice in Black babies as 'white bodies' were seen as the norm   Micro-aggressions and assumptions leading to distress and trauma for women of colour during pregnancy and birth   Reports of women and staff hearing Black women being referred to as 'aggressive' or 'angry' and Asian women as 'princesses' or 'precious'    The report exposed further racism, such as staff saying that Black women and babies have 'thick, tough skin', that a ward where South Asian families were being cared for smelled 'of curry', and that Chinese people were 'dirty'. In response to the Birthrights report, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care told the Guardian that a Maternity Disparities Taskforce set up in February would 'level up maternity care for all women, particularly those living in deprived areas or from ethnic minority backgrounds.' They added: 'It will focus on improving access to effective maternity care and care for women trying to conceive and will address factors linked to unacceptable disparities in quality of care, experiences and outcomes.'

The first study was carried out in 10 intensive care units across Scotland and examined 121 critically ill patients who were receiving treatment on ventilators due to the impact of coronavirus on their system. One in three of the patients in the study showed evidence of abnormalities in the right side of the heart - the area that pumps blood to the lungs, researchers found.  Nearly half (47%) of ventilated patients in the study died because of Covid-19, a figure comparable to national and international death rates.  'A combination of factors create the perfect storm for Covid-19 to damage the right side of your heart, which ultimately can cause death,' Dr Philip McCall, lead author of the study and consultant in Cardiothoracic Anaesthesia and Intensive Care at NHS Golden Jubilee, said. Experts at the NHS Golden Jubilee University National Hospital in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, said that the findings could play a vital role in not only saving the lives of Covid-19 patients, but for the care of potentially fatal heart and lung issues generally, as well as helping prepare for any possible future pandemic. Dr Ben Shelley, chief investigator of the study and consultant in Anaesthesia and Intensive Care at the NHS Golden Jubilee, said: 'The study has revealed that there is no doubt Covid-19 affects the heart and has a major impact on outcomes for the patient. 'However, now that we know this actually happens, and have a better understanding of how it affects people, we can plan for the future and put in place new care plans and treatments to help combat this.' In another study published in the journal Nature Medicine, researchers analysed the outcomes of 159 people hospitalised with Covid between May 2020 and March 2021. 'Our study provides objective evidence of abnormalities at one to two months post-Covid and these findings tie in with persisting symptoms at that time and the likelihood of ongoing health needs one year later,' Prof Colin Berry, of the University of Glasgow, which led the CISCO-19 (Cardiac imaging in Sars coronavirus disease-19) study said.  People who had been hospitalised with Covid showed several abnormalities, including in results from imaging of the heart, lungs and kidneys, the study found. One in eight of those who were hospitalised for Covid were most likely to have myocarditis, or heart inflammation, experts said. Healthcare workers with acute kidney injury was more likely to have myocarditis as well as those with more severe disease requiring invasive ventilation. Additionally, people who have been hospitalised with Covid were more likely to need outpatient secondary care or be referred for long Covid, with death and re-hospitalisations also much higher in this group.  Although both studies focussed on patients who experienced severe Covid infection, the results have helped scientists learn about the wide ranging impacts of the virus. Researchers say the findings also serve as a reminder for the general population to stay vigilant about Covid.

Devastatingly, the 11-year-old had a finger amputated after he suffered an injury trying to flee bullies at school.  The young Black student was attacked, beaten and pushed to the ground in his school in Abertillery, Wales, based on racist bullying, said his mother Shantal. Doctors worked six hours to save Raheem's fingers but ultimately could not save it. Since she shared the news, the story has gained worldwide attention, with the likes of Anthony Joshua, Jadon Sancho and US basketball player Gerald Green speaking out.  The mum also started a GoFundMe page with the intention of raising PS10k for Raheem's medical costs, including a prosthetic finger. But since the story broke out, donations have poured in, far exceeding the family's expectations. Currently, the donations stand nearly at PS100,000, at PS94,104 Shantal Bailey wrote on the donations page: 'Raheem has faced racial and physical abuse, as well as more generic bullying about his height and other things, since he started secondary school in September 2021.' Though she had been aware of some comments, she was not aware of the extent of her son's bullying, she said.  'Raheem was attacked by a group of children and beaten (mainly kicked) after being pushed to the ground. Consequently, Raheem made a desperate attempt to leave the school grounds in order to escape the situation. 'Whilst climbing the fence, his finger got caught and attached to it, causing the skin to strip and the finger to break in half it.' The mother said she had contacted the school about the incident and was assured it would be dealt with. The school, Abertillery Learning Community, announced yesterday that it would be closed today as it work with police to investigate the issue. In a statement issued on Sunday, Blaenau Gwent County Borough Council said that all campuses would be closed on Monday, saying: 'Abertillery Learning Community is working with Gwent Police in relation to an ongoing investigation into an alleged assault on the secondary campus. 'All campuses at Abertillery Learning Community will be closed tomorrow on health and safety grounds. 'Learners will access blended learning for Monday, 23rd May. The safety and well-being of learners and staff remains of paramount importance to the Learning Community and the Local Authority at all times.'", "d3f3a01dc4b74d07ac0a706bd618b562beecef873bc44bb63609a022": "Boris Johnson asked a top civil servant not to publish a potentially damaging report into the culture of lockdown rule-breaking parties in Westminster, a report has suggested, as the prime minster faced fresh accusations he lied to parliament. Sue Gray is expected - as early as Tuesday - to make public her investigation into partygate, and is likely to be damning of Johnson's leadership that led to repeated violations of the rules across No 10 and Whitehall. On Monday night, The Times reported Johnson suggested to Gray that there was now no need for her to publish her report following the completion of the police investigation. The paper quoted a Whitehall source as saying: 'He asked her was there much point in doing it now that it's all out there.' A Number 10 spokesman told HuffPost UK: 'Any meeting between the PM or his officials with Sue Gray was ultimately to ensure the swift and thorough conclusion of her report and its publication to parliament - which is imminent. The PM will respond to her conclusions at that point.' It comes as images emerged of Johnson raising a glass at a Downing Street leaving party during lockdown. The images - obtained by ITV News - were taken at a do for departing communications chief Lee Cain on November 13, 2020, just days after Johnson had ordered a second national lockdown in England. Asked last December in the Commons whether there had been a party in No 10 on that date, the prime minister said 'no' and added he was sure the rules were followed at all times. Labour said there was now 'no doubt' that Johnson had 'lied' to MPs.   Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Police is facing questions as to why Johnson was not fined in relation to the event when photographs showed him, drink in hand, alongside a table strewn with food and wine bottles. There were at least eight other people in the room at a time when people were banned from social mixing, other than to meet one person outside, and at least one individual has received a fixed penalty notice in relation to an event on that date. Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper has written to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) calling for it to examine the Met's Operation Hillman inquiry into events in No 10 and Whitehall.   Supporters of the prime minister have been growing in confidence that he can survive calls for his resignation after receiving just one fine over a gathering the Cabinet Office for his 56th birthday. In the short term, Johnson's fate will lie with Tory MPs who will have to decide whether Gray's findings are sufficiently serious to warrant a push to oust him as leader. After the pictures emerged, Steve Baker, an influential Conservative MP, shared an NHS campaign poster urging people to obey lockdown rules.  The Brexiteer, who was pivotal in bringing down David Cameron and Theresa May, posted the image of a woman breathing through an oxygen mask with the message: 'Look into her eyes and tell her you never bend the rules.'  No comment was added to the image.   In April, Baker, a former minister, called for the prime minister to quit over partygate, telling the Commons: 'The prime minister now should be long gone. Really, the prime minister should just know the gig's up.'   Meanwhile, Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross demanded the prime minister explain why he believed his behaviour was 'acceptable' when most people would think the pictures published by ITV News were 'unjustifiable and wrong'.   Veteran Conservative backbench MP Sir Roger Gale - a long-standing critic of Johnson - said it was clear that he should go. 'It's absolutely clear that there was a party, that he attended it, that he was raising a glass to toast one of his colleagues. And therefore, he misled us from the despatch box. And, honourably, there is one answer,' he told Times Radio. His comments were echoed by the former leader of the Scottish Conservatives, Ruth Davidson, who said Johnson's position had become untenable. 'There is now photographic evidence that when the prime minister stood up in parliament and was asked directly 'was there a party in No 10 on this date' and he replied 'no', he lied to parliament,' she told Channel 4 News. A No 10 spokeswoman said: 'The Cabinet Office and the Met Police have had access to all information relevant to their investigations, including photographs. 'The Met have concluded their investigation and Sue Gray will publish her report in the coming days, at which point the prime minister will address parliament in full.'", "cc3759fb85e9caf7e8a48236df023bbd10a1f3ae6c0236703445df9a": "Cabinet minister Grant Shapps has sought to downplay the latest partygate photo, suggesting it does not show Boris Johnson was actually at a party. The prime minister is once again in hot water after a new photograph appeared to show him raising a glass at a leaving party for his former spin doctor in Downing Street. The image, revealed by ITV News, was apparently taken at a get-together to mark the departure of Lee Cain, who was the Downing Street director of communications, on November 13, 2020, when the country was in lockdown.  It casts doubt over statements Johnson has given the House of Commons, in which he repeatedly said no Covid rules had been broken. But seeking to defend Johnson from the latest revelations, Shapps told Sky News: 'This is well-covered territory. 'These are things that we have known about. 'The prime minister has said it shouldn't have happened and he has apologised and of course the police have spent their time investigating it as well. 'I don't think the fact of the pictures, us seeing them for the first time, changes what the police and Sue Gray would have already known.'  Gray is due to publish her full report into partygate this week. The prime minister's political future had looked secure due to the fact he had only received one fine from the Metropolitan Police for attending a gathering to mark his 56th birthday in the Cabinet room of No.10 on June 19, 2020.   But the emergence of the photo means Johnson is facing renewed questions over the truthfulness of statements he made in the Commons regarding partygate.  Any minister who is known to have intentionally misled the House is expected to offer their resignation. On December 8 last year Labour MP Catherine West asked him: 'Will the prime minister tell the house whether there was a party in Downing Street on 13 November?'  Johnson replied: 'No, but I am sure that whatever happened, the guidance was followed and the rules were followed at all times.'  Asked what the PM thought was happening when he attended the event pictured in the photo, Shapps replied: 'Probably what what happened is he was at the end of a busy day, he walks down, he says cheers to somebody who's worked there and walks out and to him that is not a party.'  The transport secretary did also not deny reports that Johnson suggested to Gray that she did not need to publish her partygate investigation. He told Sky News: 'I wasn't in the room so I don't know that's the case. 'Exactly what was discussed, I don't know. 'Occasionally things get reported that are not entirely accurate, the civil service were there to make sure that all the correct processes were followed so I have no particular reason for concern about the two of them meeting.'  Presenter Kay Burley then asked: 'So just before we move on...you're completely comfortable about that photograph on the front pages?' 'Well look I'm not, I've already told you I couldn't see my own dad for a long period of time because we were obeying the rules, but I also accept that the prime minister has long since apologised and has made fundamental reforms in No.10,' Shapps said. 'I've no doubt that if he had his time again, would not have dropped by to say thank you to a member of staff leaving. 'It is what it is.' A number of Tory MPs have expressed anger at the photo since it was leaked to ITV News. David Simmonds, the MP for Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner, demanded Johnson explain how the picture did not portray him drinking at a rule-breaking party. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I think most colleagues committed to their constituents that they would wait until they had sight of the full report from Sue Gray, I think that is still the case. 'But clearly it does create an issue. We had a vote which the Conservative Party was neutral on in parliament that there would be an investigation about what was said. 'Clearly it does raise a new question that we were all told very clearly that there definitely had not been a party on the day in question and these photographs have emerged which suggest that that's not the case. 'We need to hear the prime minister's explanation for that.' A No 10 spokesperson said yesterday: 'The Cabinet Office and the Met Police have had access to all information relevant to their investigations, including photographs. 'The Met have concluded their investigation and Sue Gray will publish her report in the coming days, at which point the prime minister will address parliament in full.'

The London mayor spoke out after pictures emerged of the prime minister making a toast at the event in Number 10, which was held to mark the departure of his director of communications, Lee Cain.  Johnson's ministerial red box is resting on a chair as he addresses staff members while holding a plastic glass in his hand.   The pictures were revealed as senior civil servant Sue Gray prepares to publish her report into partygate. Cain's leaving party was one of the gatherings investigated by the Metropolitan Police.   However, the PM was only fined for attending a surprise birthday party thrown for him in Number 10 in June, 2020. On Radio Four's Today programme, Khan - who is also police and crime commissioner for London - said: 'I think it's important, when it comes to trust and confidence, when it comes to policing by consent, when it comes to questions being asked about the integrity of an investigation that the police explain why they've reached the conclusions they have.  'And just like you I suspect, yesterday was the first time I saw the photograph of Boris Johnson raising a glass, clearly bottles of wine laying around, others with wine in their hand, on a day when he said in the Houses of Commons, and I speak as a former parliamentarian and I know the importance of not lying or misleading in the House of Commons, that there wasn't a party.' The pictures emerged as senior civil servant Sue Gray prepares to publish her full report into the affair. HuffPost UK understands she is 'likely' to hand it to Number 10 tomorrow. Khan added: 'So you know, of course, Sue Gray will publish her report this week and of course the Prime Minister will have to answer for himself, but I think the police should explain why they reached their conclusions and provide that clarity.' Meanwhile, transport secretary Grant Shapps has insisted the pictures do not show Johnson attending a party. He told Sky News: 'Probably what what happened is he was at the end of a busy day, he walks down, he says cheers to somebody who's worked there and walks out and to him that is not a party.'", "da545e06c6d8a516dd5f433189932704a04bc849b7999314ffd86bba": "Billie Eilish is spreading awareness about living with Tourette's Syndrome.  The Grammy-award winner recently opened up about her neurological disorder in an interview with David Letterman for his Netflix series, My Next Guest Needs No Introduction. The singer was diagnosed at the age of 11 with Tourette's, which causes uncontrollable repetitive movements or unwanted sounds known as tics.  The tics are involuntary and can manifest in gestures, such as repeatedly blinking the eyes, shrugging shoulders and blurting out offensive words, according to the Mayo Clinic. 'If you film me for long enough, you're gonna see lots of tics,' Billie shared. The Ocean Eyes singer said that people sometimes misunderstood her tics during social interactions.  'The most common way that people react is they laugh because they think I'm trying to be funny,' she said. 'And I'm always left incredibly offended by that.' Most of her tics have worn off, but Billie revealed she still has some mild ones that go unnoticed by others. 'These are things you would never notice if you're just having a conversation with me,' the 20-year-old said. 'But for me, they're very exhausting.' Billie isn't alone in her struggle. She discovered the disorder is much more common than she initially thought and divulged that other artists have confided in her about their own battles with Tourette's.  'What's funny is so many people have it that you would never know,' she said. 'A couple artists came forward and said, 'I've actually always had Tourette's.''  The pop star did not disclose any of the artists' names out of respect for their privacy. 'I'm not gonna out them because they don't wanna talk about it, but that was actually really interesting to me.'  Billie, currently traveling on her Happier Than Ever World Tour, said she doesn't experience tics while she's performing. 'When I'm moving around, I'm not even ticking at all.' The young musician said that over time she's become more comfortable discussing the disorder despite not having all the answers.  'I really love answering questions about it because it's very, very interesting, and I am incredibly confused by it,' she said. 'I don't get it.'", "e3695975a02cf89b3cb127e63d16e9593b212010934b0a385f54206a": "We hope you love the products we recommend! All of them were independently selected by our editors.

Oh, and FYI -- prices are accurate and items in stock as of time of publication. Blush - from liquid formula to creamy sticks - is having a major moment right now. It's the go-to makeup product of the season, according to TikTok, and it's easy to see why. Blush is one product that can really step up your makeup routine and make a huge difference to the end result.  It's super versatile and can be applied across various areas of your face, depending on the result you want to achieve. For a natural, rosy glow, it should be applied to the apples of the cheeks. While, to give your look a lift, it should be applied just above the cheekbones, and to add a little extra glow to skin, it can be applied to the nose.  But, the thing about blush - like all makeup - is that not all products are made equal. Some formulas leave skin streaked with overly bright hues that, no matter what you do, just don't seem to blend into skin and give that 'clown effect'. While others cake and clog skin.  The truth is that finding the right blush, that's also within your price range, can be tricky.  But, panic not, we've rounded up a selection of wonderfully easy-to-use options, ranging from PS3 to PS30, that will give your skin a gloriously subtle glow.

More than one in 10 cases of heart disease could be prevented if people slashed the amount of time they spent in front of the TV, a new study suggests. Experts at the University of Cambridge said sitting around after a large evening meal - and snacking in front of the TV - all increase the risk of ill health.  They suggest that more than one in 10 cases of coronary heart disease could be prevented if people watched less than an hour of TV a day. But, if that is not possible (or just unlikely), they suggest getting up and moving around to break up TV-watching habits - and ditching the crisps and chocolates. It adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that watching one show after another is wreaking havoc with our brains and bodies.   Dr Youngwon Kim, assistant professor at the University of Hong Kong and visiting researcher at the Medical Research Council's epidemiology unit at Cambridge, told the PA news agency: 'In addition to reducing the actual amount of time you sit watching TV, there are other measures that you might take, such as breaking up your TV viewing and doing some light exercise in between. 'You could also try to avoid snacking, particularly on high calorie foods such as crisps and chocolates. 'All of these measures could help better manage your risk of developing coronary heart disease.' The most common symptoms of coronary heart disease are chest pain (angina) and breathlessness. It increases the risk of heart attack and stroke. In the study, published in the journal BMC Medicine, researchers calculated that 11% of cases of coronary heart disease could be prevented if people watched less than an hour of TV each day, but they found people using computers had no obvious risk. They used data from the UK Biobank study on 373,026 people and also looked at genetic susceptibility to heart disease. The team examined the differences between people watching TV and using a computer for leisure by assessing their answers to questionnaires. The findings over a 13-year follow-up showed that, compared with more than four hours of TV a day, there was a 16% lower chance of coronary heart disease if people watched less than an hour a day, regardless of genetic risk. For those who watched two to three hours of TV a day, there was a 6% lower risk of developing the condition compared to watching more than four hours. The study found that spending leisure time in front of a computer did not appear to influence the risk of disease. The team suggested possible reasons for this, including that TV viewing tends to occur in the evening following dinner, often the highest calorie meal of the day, leading to higher levels of fats and cholesterol in the blood.  People may also snack more in front of the TV than when using a computer, while TV viewing tends to be prolonged. People using a computer may be more likely to break up their activity, they said. Dr Katrien Wijndaele, from Cambridge, said: 'Coronary heart disease is one of the most prominent causes of premature death, so finding ways to help people manage their risk through lifestyle modification is important. 'The World Health Organisation recommends reducing the amount of sedentary behaviour and replacing it with physical activity of any intensity as a way of keeping healthier. 'While it isn't possible to say for certain that sitting watching TV increases your risk of coronary heart disease, because of various potential confounding factors and measurement error, our work supports the WHO's guidelines.' According to the British Heart Foundation, coronary heart disease is one of the UK's leading causes of death, responsible for around 64,000 deaths each year. Its senior cardiac nurse, Chloe MacArthur, said: 'Most of us watch TV sitting down, and we know from decades of research that leading a sedentary lifestyle can lead to health problems later in life, including an increased risk of coronary heart disease. 'While it can be difficult to weave physical activity into our daily routines, it only takes 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise each week to help reduce your risk of developing heart and circulatory diseases. 'When the temptation hits you to watch one more episode, try standing up and stretching, or go for an evening stroll instead. Stopping evening snacks and ensuring you eat a healthy balanced diet can also give your heart health a boost.'

No comment was added to the image. In April, Baker, a former minister, called for the prime minister to quit over partygate, telling the Commons: 'The prime minister now should be long gone. Really, the prime minister should just know the gig's up.' Johnson had been facing increasing pressure from his own MPs after he was handed a fixed-penalty notice for a gathering for his 56th birthday in June 2020. But efforts to force him out seemed to have eased after the Metropolitan Police last week concluded its inquiry into partygate, and took no further action against the PM. After ITV News published four images on Monday, showing the prime minister with a drink in his hand while standing behind a table littered with wine bottles and food, there were signs Tory unease had returned. Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross - another who had urged Johnson to go -demanded the prime minister explain why he believes his behaviour was 'acceptable' when most will think the pictures 'seem unjustifiable and wrong'. His predecessor, Ruth Davidson, went further by saying Johnson should resign. For disquiet to translate into a leadership challenge, 53 Tory MPs would need to to write to the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady, calling for a vote of no confidence. However, some of those demanding Johnson's resignation at the start of the year have since withdrawn their letters arguing that the crisis in Ukraine is the wrong time for a prolonged leadership struggle. And some Conservatives were standing by their leader, with backbencher Peter Bone suggesting the image 'doesn't prove anything'. Downing Street declined to defend the scene portrayed, saying the prime minister will comment after the Sue Gray report into partygate is published in the coming days.  The pictures were taken at a leaving party for then-director of communications Lee Cain on November 13 2020, eight days after Johnson imposed England's second national coronavirus lockdown. For four weeks, people were banned from social mixing, other than to meet one person outside. Johnson had previously told the Commons there was 'no' party in Downing Street on that date - raising questions about whether he knowingly misled parliament, which would mean he would be expected to offer his resignation. Other reaction on social media poked fun at the Metropolitan Police (which has reportedly fined at least one person attending the November 13 event, but not the PM), the 'ambushed by cake' defence and the campaign to accuse Keir Starmer of breaking lockdown rules too.

The charity worker's daughter, Gabriella, was just 22 months old when the British-Iranian was arrested on trumped up charges of plotting against the Iranian regime, which she has always denied, in 2016. The family - including husband Richard Ratcliffe and Gabriella, who is now seven - were reunited in March after UK officials finally settled a 40-year PS400million debt to Tehran.  Speaking to the BBC's Emma Barnett, Zaghari-Ratcliffe claimed prime minister Boris Johnson admitted to her the link between the money owed and her release. Ministers had for years insisted the two were unrelated, despite the family arguing otherwise. Zaghari-Ratcliffe explained she wanted to 'come to terms with what had happened to me, just like when somebody is hit by a car or when somebody gets cancer'' and she wanted Johnson to know 'what has happened to me. What it looked like'.  She continued: 'I have lost that six years of my life and my child's life. There is nothing that can make that up for me.  'Can I take those years back? I don't think so. I can't still look at my daughter's baby pictures. There was a huge amount of videos and film and pictures that my family had taken from her when she was away from me. I just couldn't. I just can't go through with them.' Zaghari-Ratcliffe added: 'I had a lot of her baby toys and baby clothes in Iran collected to be shipped back with me to London. And they finally arrived. I couldn't open. So there is this legacy, the emotional legacy that will stay with me forever.' Zaghari-Ratcliffe said Gabriella was the source of her strength, and it was the love of her child that kept her alive. She said: 'Had I known on that day that I'm going to be in prison for five years, and then one extra year in Iran banned to leave the country, I would have just dropped dead. I don't think I could survive. 'But also, on the other hand, I was telling a very, very dear friend of mine that human being is tough, you know, is tenacious, is resilient. But it amazes me how, if you come out of it, how stronger you will be. And I think that that is what happened to me.' She spoke about her husband, whose tireless campaigning included going on a 21-day hunger strike outside the Foreign Office: 'It has been an amazing journey for both of us. If anything our love has gone a lot deeper. 'We have gained so much. We have lost a lot more. But the mind of human being works in a way that you thankfully gradually forget the bad things and you remember the good things. 'So I would like to hold on to the idea that my love has got a lot deeper than before.' Zaghari-Ratcliffe also revealed she was forced to sign a 'false confession' in front of a UK government witness before she was allowed to leave Iran. The dual national said the act captured on camera by the Iranians was 'dehumanising', and that she expects Tehran to use it against her in the future. While 'under duress', she said she had to admit to the Iranians' allegations after they detained her for six years having accused her of spying, a charge she and the UK denied. Zaghari-Ratcliffe said she was taken to the airport by the Revolutionary Guards without seeing her parents on the day in March when she was to be freed. 'Instead I was made to sign the forced confession at the airport in the presence of the British government,' Zaghari-Ratcliffe said. 'They told me that 'you won't be able to get on the plane', and I knew that that was like a last-minute game because I knew they were... They told me that they have been given the money,' she said. 'So what is the point of making me sign a piece of paper which is incorrect? It's a false confession.'", "b5b3841546ba0a05e8c4b3a5c208508b03a402a36a95f3f2f7a72e19": "Get that factor 50 ready, because another long, hot summer of love is just around the corner.  Yes, a new series of Love Island is almost upon us, as another batch of singletons set off to Spain for more cracking on, pieing off and everything in between.  This year, there's some big changes afoot for the ITV2 dating show as it enters its eighth series - here's everything we can tell you about it... Is there a new Love Island villa? After being located at the famous property in Mallorca's St Llorenc des Cardassar since 2017, Love Island is on the move this year and will be coming from a brand new location.  While ITV has confirmed the show's relocation, no official details or photos have yet been revealed.  However, that has not stopped paparazzi hunting down what they have alleged is the new villa.  Pictures published by various tabloids show construction work at the property to transform it into a setting familiar to the show's fans.  Who is presenting Love Island this year? There had been speculation ITV was lining up a replacement host for Laura Whitmore, who has presented the show since 2020.  Strictly Come Dancing favourite AJ Odudu and former Islander Maura Higgins both were linked to the role in the press, but Laura has in fact signed up to present her third series.  This was confirmed in a Love Island trailer, which showed her and narrator Iain Stirling's names on respective water bottles.  Iain - who is married to Laura - is also returning, having already provided his voice to the official trailer.  Who are the rumoured Love Island contestants? A number of people have already been linked to this year's Love Island, although ITV is remaining tight-lipped until it announces the starting line-up, with that big reveal likely coming a week prior to the series' launch.  Those who have been rumoured to enter the villa include Newcastle student Kat Harrison, who previously dated Geordie Shore's Marty McKenna; model and boxer Joshua Legrove; beautician Sophie Draper, who was once linked to Aston Villa player Matty Cash; Toby Bougouneau, who previously appeared on ITV2 dating show Ready To Mingle; Brad McDermott, who is the brother of 2018 contestant Zara; basketball player Jordan Spencer; Gemma Owen, the daughter of former England player Michael; Missy Keating, who is the daughter of Boyzone's Ronan and Turkish actress Ekin-Su Culculoglu. Check out some of their Instagram snaps below... How long will Love Island last this year? Reports had suggested that this year would see the longest-ever series of Love Island. However, in promotional material released to the press, it was confirmed that it will run for eight weeks, as was the case in series 4, 5 and 7.  What else is new for Love Island 2022? For the first time ever, Islanders will be wearing second-hand clothes, as eBay is now the show's first ever pre-loved fashion partner. They will have access to a shared wardrobe situated in the new villa for the first time ever. It marks a huge tone shift for the show, considering it previously partnered with I Saw It First and alumni have gone on to be brand ambassadors for the likes of Boohoo, Pretty Little Thing and Asos. When does Love Island start? As yet, series eight of Love Island does not have an official start date, with a trailer simply saying 'This June'.  However, reports have suggested that it will launch on Monday 6 June, although ITV is yet to confirm this.  After a delayed start to the 2021 series due to the pandemic - which saw the show kick off at the end of June - this would return the show to its traditional early June start.

These small growths on the skin - which are usually round or oval in shape and pink, tan, brown or black in colour - are very common and generally harmless. But occasionally, an abnormal mole can be a sign of melanoma, a relatively rare but deadly form of skin cancer. So it's crucial to know what to look for. (Non-melanoma skin cancers like basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas make up the majority of cases, but tend to be less aggressive.)  Melanoma can develop from an existing mole, but more commonly, it appears as a new lesion on the skin. It can appear anywhere on the body but the most common locations are the chest and back for men and legs for women. The good news is that, when caught early, melanoma is typically curable, dermatologist Dr. Darrell S. Rigel tells HuffPost. 'If it is caught early, a simple removal typically suffices to achieve a cure,' says Rigel, a clinical professor of dermatology and director of the Melanoma Surveillance Clinic at the Mount Sinai Icahn School of Medicine. However, once it has spread, the survival rate for melanoma is less than 50% - even with some of the newly available treatments, Rigel explained, noting that this type of cancer 'tends to spread early in its course.' Certain factors may increase your risk of melanoma, including excessive sun exposure, use of indoor tanning beds, having atypical moles and having a family history of the disease. It's also more common among people with fair skin that burns easily, red or blond hair and light-coloured eyes.  People of colour are much less likely to get melanoma than white people - but are more likely to die if they do get it, due to a lack of public and professional awareness. For those with darker skin tones, melanomas tend to show up in areas with less sun exposure like the palms of the hands, soles of the feet or beneath the fingernails or toenails. How to spot a suspicious mole  To help determine if your mole might actually be a cancerous melanoma, use the dermatologist-backed ABCDE rule, which stands for asymmetry, border, colour, diameter and evolving. If your mole fits one or more of the criteria below, make an appointment with your dermatologist to get it checked out. Don't panic. Most atypical moles do not become cancerous. But it's worth having any suspicious spots examined to be safe.  Asymmetry: if you were to draw a line down the centre of the mole, one half wouldn't match the other's shape or size.  Border that's irregular: it might have edges that are notched, scalloped or blurred, 'meaning the borders between the mole and normal skin are unclear,' Seattle dermatologist Dr. Joyce Park tells HuffPost.  Colour that's uneven: pay attention if the colouring is not uniform throughout. The same mole may include 'reds and pinks, varying shades of brown and black,' Park said. As it grows, you may even notice some white or blue appears. Diameter greater than a quarter of an inch: Think the size of a pea or a pencil eraser.  Evolving: the mole is growing in size or changing in shape or color.  Keep an eye out for what dermatologists refer to as 'ugly ducklings' - in other words, moles that stick out because they appear 'markedly different from the rest of the moles on your body,' Park said.  Know that not all melanomas fit the above descriptors. So as a general rule of thumb: If there's a spot on your body that's 'growing, crusting, bleeding or changing significantly' have it looked at by your dermatologist, Rigel advised.  The American Academy of Dermatology also recommends doing your own regular skin self-exams at home. Look at your whole body - front and back - in a mirror. Then lift your arms and look at your right and left sides. Be sure to also check your forearms, armpits, palms of your hands, as well as the back of your legs, between your toes and the bottoms of your feet. Don't forget your nails, neck and scalp, too. It may be useful to have a loved one take a look at the back side of your body or any other areas that are difficult for you to see, or to ask your hairstylist to take a look at your scalp.  'In order for this process to be effective, you need to take the time to learn your skin and your moles,' Rigel says. 'For those at risk for skin cancer, self skin examinations [are] recommended monthly. We also recommend this group see their dermatologist annually.' What to do if you see something suspicious The dermatologist will perform a physical exam, inspecting the suspicious spot with their eyes and also with a dermatoscope -- a non-invasive magnifying instrument that allows them to get a better look at the lesion.  'If the mole looks suspicious for cancer, or if it has been changing or growing in size, the dermatologist might take a biopsy,' Park says. 'We use local anaesthetic to numb the skin, then remove the mole.' This is typically done with a 'simple scrape,' Rigel says, which is then covered by a bandage and does not require stitches. Afterward, the skin sample is sent to the lab for testing. 'The results come back from the pathologist in a few days and the appropriate follow-up can be done then,' Rigel says  Reducing your risk of skin cancer To minimise your chances of developing skin cancer, stay in the shade when you can - especially between the hours of 10am and 2pm, when the sun is at its strongest, as the American Academy of Dermatology recommends.  Wear a sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher that's broad-spectrum and water-resistant. And don't forget to reapply every couple of hours or after sweating or swimming. Wide-brimmed hats, sunglasses with UV protection and lightweight, long-sleeved shirts and pants can provide extra protection, too.  And if you're ever concerned about a spot on your skin, don't hesitate to get it checked out by a dermatologist.  'The visit is easy and most of the time it will turn out to be nothing,' Rigel says. 'But if it is something, getting it taken care of as early as possible is critical.'

But on Monday afternoon, ITV published photographs showing the prime minister raising a glass while stood behind a table littered with wine bottles and food. The broadcaster said the pictures were taken at a leaving party for then-director of communications Lee Cain. The photographs show at least eight people standing close together. Eight days earlier, Johnson had imposed England's second national lockdown. Under the rules only two people from different households were allowed to mix indoors - unless it was for work purposes.  On December 8, 2021, Johnson was asked directly in the Commons about what happened on November 13. This matters because Johnson is facing an investigation into whether he misled parliament. The ministerial code states that 'ministers who knowingly mislead parliament will be expected to offer their resignation'.  But the key word there is 'knowingly' - Johnson's defence has been that he did not think anything he did broke the laws that he had imposed on the country. Theresa May, the former prime minister, recently said of her successor's defence: 'So either he had not read the rules, did not understand them, or didn't think the rules applied to No.10. Which was it?'  The publication of the photos comes ahead of the release of Sue Gray's report into the partygate scandal. It is expected the report, which is thought to include photos of lockdown-breaking gatherings in No.10 and Whitehall, will be made public as soon as Tuesday. It comes after the Metropolitan Police's own separate inquiry concluded. A total of 83 people were fined for events spanning eight separate days, including the PM, his wife Carrie Johnson and chancellor Rishi Sunak. They all received one fixed penalty notice for an event for Johnson's 56th birthday in June 2020, when indoor mixing was banned. Johnson was not handed a fine for the November 13 event pictured in the photographs obtained by ITV. A No.10 spokesperson said said: 'The Cabinet Office and the Met Police have had access to all information relevant to their investigations, including photographs. 'The Met have concluded their investigation and Sue Gray will publish her report in the coming days, at which point the Prime Minister will address Parliament in full.'", "098709395cde315c89ee27b977fbc2c9ddc3e829b1406c3fc5019e2f": "Pictures have emerged of Boris Johnson raising a glass and appearing to make a toast at a Downing Street leaving party for his former top spin doctor. The images, revealed by ITV News, were apparently taken at a get-together to mark the departure of Lee Cain, who was the Downing Street director of communications, on November 13, 2020. Johnson's ministerial red box is resting on a chair as he addresses staff members while holding a plastic glass in his hand. The pictures were revealed as senior civil servant Sue Gray prepares to publish her report into partygate. Cain's leaving party was one of the gatherings investigated by the Metropolitan Police. However, the PM was only fined for attending a surprise birthday party thrown for him in Number 10 in June, 2020.  The four pictures appear to show the prime minister addressing at least seven members of staff in the 10 Downing Street press office. On a table in front of him are several opened bottles of wine and some snacks. Covid rules at the time banned parties with people outside of your household. Eight days earlier, England was placed under another strict lockdown as cases of the virus soared. The pictures also leave the prime minister open to accusations that he misled parliament. On December 8 last year, Labour MP Catherine West asked him: 'Will the prime minister tell the house whether there was a party in Downing Street on 13 November?' Johnson replied: 'No, but I am sure that whatever happened, the guidance was followed and the rules were followed at all times.' A No 10 spokesperson said: 'The Cabinet Office and the Met Police have had access to all information relevant to their investigations, including photographs. The Met have concluded their investigation and Sue Gray will publish her report in the coming days, at which point the Prime Minister will address Parliament in full.' Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said: 'While the British public were making huge sacrifices, Boris Johnson was breaking the law. 'Boris Johnson said repeatedly that he knew nothing about law-breaking - there's no doubt now, he lied. Boris Johnson made the rules, and then broke them. 'The prime minister has demeaned his office. The British people deserve better. While Labour has a plan for tackling the cost-of-living crisis, Tory MPs are too busy defending the indefensible actions of Boris Johnson.' Lib Dem deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: 'People will rightly be furious to see pictures of Johnson drinking at what is an obvious party, when he repeatedly told us that the rules were followed at all times. 'These photos show Boris Johnson has taken the British people for fools. While the public made huge sacrifices, he partied in Number 10. 'It's becoming clearer than ever that Boris Johnson lied to the British people and to parliament. 'Conservative MPs must do their duty and sack this law-breaking Prime Minister. Every day he remains in office will do more damage to public trust and to our democracy.'", "b13cde01b018af48cf7810699f904162bb6ec48ab964616e3a13791a": "Monkeypox cases in the UK have risen again, meaning 56 people have now been confirmed with the infection as of Monday. Here's everything we know about the virus so far. What is it? Monkeypox is a viral infection, common in West and Central Africa. Cases in Europe have occurred before, but usually in small numbers. Some people have compared it to smallpox, but it's actually milder, less infectious and less deadly. It is called monkeypox because it was first discovered in monkeys in a lab back in 1958, but it can be transmitted to humans via other animals too. It usually disappears within a week on its own, and people usually recover without long-term health effects. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has said that the west African clade, the less severe strain seen in Europe during this recent outbreak, has a case fatality rate of around 3.6%. This estimate is based from studies conducted in African nations where the virus is more common. No deaths have been reported from the current outbreak as of yet. What are the symptoms?    Fever   Headache   Muscle aches   Backache   Swollen lymph nodes   Chills   Exhaustion   Weakness   Rash   The rash can start on the face before moving to the body. It gradually transforms, and can form sores comparable to chickenpox or syphilis before scabbing. The scab falls off but can leave a scar. The incubation period (the time before symptoms appear) is usually from six to 13 days but can range from five to 21 days. How is it transmitted?  Usually monkeypox can be traced back to travel from West and Central Africa, where people have picked up the infection from animals in rainforests. However, recent numbers suggest that is no longer the case. As the WHO explains: 'The identification of confirmed and suspected cases of monkeypox with no direct travel links to an endemic area represents a highly unusual event.' Transmission appears to be occurring between people who have close physical contact, where people have direct contact with a lesion, respiratory droplets or contaminated materials like bedding, clothes or utensils. This has falsely led some to believe monkeypox can be listed as a sexually transmitted infection, but it does not pass through sexual fluids. Even so, this has sent some alarm bells ringing because monkeypox transmission has never been described this way before. Most of the UK cases so far are among 'individuals who self-identify as gay, or bisexual, or other men who have sex with men', according to the UKHSA's Dr Susan Hopkins. How does it compare to Covid? The government has made it clear that the monkeypox cases are not comparable to the early Covid infections we saw at the beginning of the pandemic. As it is transmitted through close contact rather than as a respiratory virus, this makes it unlikely to spread through the population like Covid did. The chief secretary to the treasury Simon Clarke told Sky News on Monday that No.10 was monitoring it 'very very closely', but that he was not 'concerned about our ability to handle the situation'. Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser of the UKHSA, has previously said the risk to the general population was 'extremely low'. Is there a vaccine?  There is no specific vaccine for monkeypox widely available at the moment. However, the smallpox vaccine is said to provide good protection against monkeypox as well - this particular jab eradicated smallpox from the world in 1980 - although the government is yet to encourage anyone to get this jab. How can people avoid it? The WHO recommends protecting yourself by avoiding skin to skin or face to face contact with anyone with symptoms. It recommends practising safer sex too, and keeping your hands clean with water and soap, or hand sanitiser, and maintain respiratory etiquette. If caring for someone with suspected monkeypox, you should wear a mask and clean objects and surfaces that have been touched. If someone develops a rash and starts to suspect they have symptoms, the organisation recommends they should isolate until the scabs fall off (including abstaining from sex). The WHO also suggests the 'general precautionary measures recommended against Covid-19 are also expected to largely protect from monkeypox virus transmission'. Why do some people have to self-isolate? The UKHSA has recommended that anyone with a high risk of catching monkeypox after having direct or household contact with a confirmed case, should isolate for three weeks. These people are also advised to send their details for contact tracing, avoid travel and contact with the immunosuppressed, pregnant people and children under 12. Dr Claire Dewsnap, president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, told the Guardian: 'The vast majority of identified cases are isolating at home and do not require hospital admission.' Where else is it? The World Health Organisation is currently investigating the disease and expects the case numbers to rise. There have already been 85 confirmed cases detected across eight EU countries. During this outbreak, the virus was first identified in the UK, but has now been traced back to Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Austria, Switzerland, Israel, Australia, Canada, France, and the US. Monkeypox is endemic is Benin, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Ghana (only in animals), Ivory Coast, Liberia, Nigeria, the Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone and South Sudan.", "c6c91ea155a848247a0deef7d01de0fafbaaa0bbdd97965120b9ef28": "Audiences swept up by Heartstopper had reason to celebrate last week, as Netflix confirmed it had renewed the LGBTQ-inclusive teen series for two additional seasons.  Based on the first two volumes of Alice Oseman's web comic-turned-graphic novel series, 'Heartstopper' follows Charlie Spring (Joe Locke), the only openly gay student at his all-boys secondary school. After his relationship with a closeted classmate implodes, Charlie finds himself drawn to Nick Nelson (Kit Connor), a star athlete on the school's rugby team who appears to be straight.  At first, Charlie shrugs off his feelings for Nick as an unrequited crush. Through a surprising series of events, however, the two boys become close pals in the classroom and on the athletic field -- prompting both to question whether something beyond platonic friendship is in the cards.  In the weeks since its premiere last month, Heartstopper has become one of Netflix's most buzzed-about shows, earning sterling reviews and generating impassioned discourse on social media.  While the series catapulted Joe and Kit to stardom seemingly overnight, the 18-year-old actors didn't anticipate that their performances would be so enthusiastically received.  'It definitely always felt like our little show,' said Kit, previously best known for Rocketman, in which he portrayed a young Elton John. 'So to have it blow up like this has been mind-blowing, really.'  In a candid chat with HuffPost, the two actors shared some behind-the-scenes anecdotes about their now-iconic performances, working with surprise co-star Olivia Colman, and where they hope to take Charlie and Nick's love story next.  As actors, what drew each of you to Charlie and Nick's story, and what made you most excited to tell it? Kit Connor: In terms of Nick ... bisexuality isn't something that really comes up in mainstream media very often. So I think that in our show, we take an in-depth approach in terms of having him discover his sexuality and explore it. He goes from thinking he's straight to thinking that maybe he's gay. Then he comes to the conclusion that maybe he's bisexual. That's something that I found really interesting and important to bring into mainstream media.  Joe Locke: I think Charlie is a relatable character to a lot of people growing up. Although he is so universally relatable, his story and stories like his -- the struggles of being the only out kid in school -- have not really been told before. It's great for me to be able to tell that story for my first acting job. Where would you like to take Charlie and Nick's story in future seasons?  Locke: If we follow Charlie's story from the web comic and the novels, his mental health takes a turn for the worse. I think that would be really interesting to tackle in the series and to see how that [impacts] Charlie and Nick's relationship. Not only do they get older, but their issues become more serious. What we've created in Season 1 is an atmosphere that tackles serious subjects, but through an optimistic lens.  Connor: I think Charlie's mental health will definitely be a main focus. But we'd also touch on how they learn to deal with that as a couple -- how they learn the importance of creating a support system, while also learning that you can't always help and have to let people learn things themselves. That's a really important part of the web comic.  Olivia Coleman's portrayal of Nick's mother was such a great surprise, given that her casting was kept under wraps until the series premiere. What did you most learn from working with her? Connor: I spent two days filming with Olivia and they were amazing. I think that she's one of those actors who is just effortlessly good, skilled and talented. She'd go from being bubbly and happy to serious and emotional as soon as the crew said 'Action.' From what I know, she approaches her roles with a lot of freshness. She reads through a script a couple of times, and then just goes for it and sees where it takes her. That's what I try to do as an actor. Locke: I didn't get to work with her as much as Kit. She's so high up in her career and a household name, but she spent so much time during the day talking to everyone and making everyone feel comfortable instead of sitting in her trailer, relaxing. That's a great thing to maintain. She's just a really lovely person. What films or television programs did you look to with regard to LGBTQ representation when you were growing up? Locke: Modern Family was a big one.  Connor: Yes! Modern Family was, for me, the first time I saw an openly gay couple onscreen. Obviously a big deal was made about it, but they didn't make it seem like it was abnormal. It was very much normalised, and I think that's a first step to a healthy portrayal of queerness in media.  A number of young viewers have credited the show with helping them come out as LGBTQ to their families, or address their truth in other ways. What do you say to fans who look to your characters as role models?  Locke: It's an honor to be able to create a series that means so much to so many people. When I was growing up, if I'd have had Heartstopper, I'd have felt a lot more normal. So, I hope that that's what we can [provide] to younger people in the next generation as well, because it'll always be there as long as Netflix lives. It'll always be there for people to watch, and for younger people to watch. They are all deserving of love and happiness. Connor: We are teenagers ourselves, and to be able to have that effect on a person's life, confidence and self-love is something that's so powerful. I felt very emotional when I first heard that a fan had used a scene I'd filmed to come out to their parents. That's a real 'pinch me' moment, and that's what told me this show has an effect on the audience that even we didn't expect.  This interview has been lightly edited and condensed.

The senior civil servant already gave a taste of what was to come in January, with an interim report which blamed a 'failure of leadership and judgment' for a series of lockdown-busting parties in Number 10 and Whitehall. Her full report was held back until the conclusion of a separate Metropolitan Police investigation into the scandal. Last week, the Met announced that Operation Hillman was now finished, with 126 fixed penalty notices handed out to 83 people, including Boris Johnson, his wife Carrie and Rishi Sunak. Here HuffPost UK runs through all the key moments in the partygate scandal so far. What is Sue Gray investigating? Gray is investigating a total of 16 events that occurred between May 15 2020 -- the so-called 'wine and cheese' garden party -- and April 16 2021, when two leaving parties were held for staff hours before Prince Philip's funeral. These are just two events that have received a lot of media attention; others include the 'bring your own booze' party on May 20, 2020, the so-called 'Abba party' held in Johnson's Downing Street flat on November 13 the same year. The prime minister is said to have attended at least six gatherings in total. The 16 events Gray has investigated are:   May 15 2020: 'Wine and cheese' gathering in the Downing Street garden attended by the PM, Carrie Johnson and Cummings.    May 20 2020: 'BYOB' gathering in the garden of Downing Street to which more than 100 No.10 staff were invited by Johnson's former principal private secretary Martin Reynolds.    June 18 2020: A gathering in the Cabinet Office to mark the departure of a No.10 private secretary.   June 19 2020:  Birthday gathering for Johnson in the Cabinet room in No.10 Downing Street.   November 13 2020: A leaving party for a senior aide, thought to be former director of communications Lee Cain.   November 13 2020: An event in Johnson's flat on the night Cummings left Downing Street.   November 27 2020: a gathering in No 10 Downing Street on the departure of a special adviser.    December 10 2020: Department for Education gathering.    December 15 2020: A No 10 Downing Street gathering for an online Christmas quiz.   December 17 2020: A gathering in Cabinet Office, 70 Whitehall to hold an online Christmas quiz for the Cabinet Secretary's private office.   December 17 2020: A gathering in Cabinet Office, 70 Whitehall to mark the departure of a senior Cabinet Office official.   December 17 2020: a gathering in No.10 Downing Street to mark the departure of a No 10 official.   December 18 2020: A gathering in No.10 Downing Street before the Christmas break.   January 14 2021: A gathering in No.10 Downing Street following the departure of two No.10 private secretaries.   April 16 2021: A gathering in No.10 Downing Street on the departure of a senior No.10 official.    April 16 2021: A gathering in No.10 Downing Street on the departure of another No 10 official.     What did Gray's interim report say? In her initial report, published on January 31, Gray blamed 'failures of leadership and judgment' in No.10 and the Cabinet Office for the partygate saga.  Gray said it was 'difficult to justify' the controversial gatherings and criticised the 'excessive consumption of alcohol' by government staff. In the 12-page report, Gray said: 'At least some of the gatherings in question represent a serious failure to observe not just the high standards expected of those working at the heart of government but also of the standards expected of the entire British population at the time. 'At times it seems there was too little thought given to what was happening across the country in considering the appropriateness of some of these gatherings, the risks they presented to public health and how they might appear to the public.  'There were failures of leadership and judgment by different parts of No 10 and the Cabinet Office at different times. Some of the events should not have been allowed to take place. Other events should not have been allowed to develop as they did.' What happened after the interim report was published? Following the findings, Johnson immediately issued an apology to MPs in the House of Commons. 'I want to say sorry. I am sorry for the things we simply did not get right and sorry for the way this matter has been handled,' he said. The prime minister resisted calls to resign in the wake of the report, but sparked a fresh row by using his Commons statement to falsely accuse Labour leader Keir Starmer of failing to prosecute Jimmy Savile when he was Director of Public Prosecutions. This led to a wave of criticism, with more Tory MPs calling on him to quit and his chief policy advisor, Munira Mirza, quitting her job. In response to the criticism, Johnson announced a major shake-up of the Downing Street operation, with chief of staff, Dan Rosenfield, director of communications, Jack Doyle, and principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, all leaving their posts. Steve Barclay was brought in as chief of staff, with his fellow Conservative MP Andrew Griffith made head of policy.  What did the Met Police Investigation find? The Met concluded its investigation on May 19. The police force investigated 12 events and issued fines for eight of them.  A total of 126 fixed penalty notices for breaches of Covid-19 regulations were handed out.   Of those, 53 were men and 73 were women.  The PM, his wife and the chancellor all received a fixed penalty notice (FPN) for the birthday party held for him in the Cabinet room in Downing Street on June 19, 2020.  The Met said a team of twelve detectives were involved in the probe, which cost of total of PS460,000.   It worked through 345 documents, including emails, door logs, diary entries and witness statements, 510 photographs and CCTV images and issued 204 questionnaires. That same day, No.10 confirmed that no further action would be taken against Johnson, in what represented a significant boost to his chances of political survival.    What is the full report expected to say? According to the Times, Gray's report is expected to contain a section detailing the events that took place, another section on what happened at the gatherings and then a final statement on what should happen as a result.  Reports suggest she could publish a tranche of photos and other evidence such as WhatsApp messages and emails as part of her investigation which could incriminate an embarrass senior officials in No.10. Any negative judgments Gray does pass on the PM will undoubtedly be damaging, but his allies will likely point to the fact that he has only received one fine as proof that his role in the scandal was limited. Cabinet secretary Simon Case, on the other hand, is expected to bear the brunt of the responsibility, according to the Telegraph. How bad will it be for the prime minister? The Met's decision not to issue Johnson with any more fines -- and to fine him only for the birthday party -- means that the consensus is that his political future is secure. However, it will still make for deeply uncomfortable reading if Johnson's character is questioned by one of the country's most senior civil servants. And in his latest blog, Cummings appeared to suggest that junior civil servants who were fined could be prepared to publish potentially damaging photos. 'Any reasonable person looking at some of these photos will only be able to conclude that the PM obviously lied to the Commons, and possibly to the cops, and there is no reasonable story for how others were fined for event X but not him,' he wrote. After so many Tory MPs said they would withhold their judgment of the PM until Gray's final report, it may still be the moment they decide to submit their letter of no confidence to 1922 backbench committee chair Graham Brady. What happens next? It's not all over for Johnson even after Gray's report is published. The prime minister still faces an inquiry by the House of Commons' privileges committee into claims he misled MPs about the lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street.   Johnson has been accused of misleading parliament in December, when he insisted Covid rules had been followed in No.10 at all times.

The 48-year-old was expelled from the Conservative Party and resigned, triggering a by-election in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, after he was found guilty last month following a trial. The jury heard how he forced the then teenager to drink gin and tonic and asked him to watch pornography before the attack at a house in Staffordshire following a party in January 2008. The victim, now 29, said he was left feeling 'scared, vulnerable, numb, shocked and surprised' after Khan, then 34, touched his feet and legs, coming within 'a hair's breadth' of his privates, as he went to sleep in a top bunkbed. Khan, who denied sexual assault, was jailed for 18 months at Southwark Crown Court on Monday by Mr Justice Baker.

Zaghari-Ratcliffe said the act captured on camera by the Iranians was 'dehumanising', and that she expects Tehran to use it against her in the future. In an interview with the BBC, she said while 'under duress', she had to admit to the Iranians' allegations after they detained her for six years having accused her of spying, a charge she and the UK denied. Tulip Siddiq, the Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn, said: 'The foreign secretary must set out in parliament what she knew about this shocking revelation and what consequences it could have for my constituent. 'Nazanin has a right to be angry and our government has some serious questions to answer about her treatment.' Zaghari-Ratcliffe said she was taken to the airport by the Revolutionary Guards without seeing her parents on the day in March when she was to be freed. 'Instead I was made to sign the forced confession at the airport in the presence of the British government,' she said. The Iranians told her the UK had now settled a historic PS400 million debt dating to the 1970s. 'They told me that 'you won't be able to get on the plane'. And I knew that that was like a last minute game because I knew they were... They told me that they have been given the money,' she said. 'So what is the point of making me sign a piece of paper which is incorrect? It's a false confession.' She told the BBC's Emma Barnett that a British official was present at the time she signed the document. 'The whole thing of me signing the forced confession was filmed,' Zaghari-Ratcliffe added. 'It's a tool. So I'm sure they will show that some day.' Earlier this month, her husband Richard Ratcliffe alluded to 'mistakes made at the end' of the ordeal in Iran. Speaking after his wife's first meeting with Boris Johnson since her release, Ratcliffe said: 'I think there are lessons to learn, there is a wider problem. 'We talked about the mistakes made at the end. It was rough at the end, and I think, when Nazanin is ready to talk about it, that is something that we need to go through.'

Earlier this month, Susanna sat down with the prime minister for a live interview on Good Morning Britain, during which she pressed him on a variety of issues, including the partygate scandal and the cost of living crisis. During her interview, the anchor also questioned whether Johnson would resign as PM over the fine he received for breaking lockdown restrictions and accusations that he misled Parliament. Following the broadcast, 98 complaints were made to Ofcom, which the TV watchdog announced on Monday would not be upheld. An Ofcom spokesperson said: 'We assessed complaints about this interview with the Prime Minister. 'We found he was given sufficient opportunity to put across the Government's position, and the strong line of questioning was in keeping with regular viewers' expectations of interviews with political figures on this programme.' Boris Johnson's appearance on GMB was his first since becoming prime minister, having last been interviewed on the show during his time as foreign secretary in 2017. His 2022 interview was also notable as it included Johnson's infamous 'who's Lorraine?' comment, in which he appeared not to know who daytime staple Lorraine Kelly was. Following the interview, and Johnson's remark about her, Lorraine hailed the broadcast as 'excellent' and a 'masterclass in a political interview'. Lorraine later insisted she did not expect the PM to know who she was. Asked if Boris Johnson knows who Lorraine is, the PM's spokesperson told HuffPost UK at the time: 'I think as was clear the prime minister was not fully across the ITV daytime line-up this morning. He has a number of issues to deal with.'

Boris Bondarev said he had 'never been so ashamed of my country' as he was when it attacked its neighbour on February 24. In a lengthy letter announcing his resignation as Russia's Counsellor to the United Nations in Geneva, he accused Vladimir Putin of unleashing war 'against the entire Western world'. His announcement is a further blow to the Russian president, who has seen his hopes of a swift military victory disappear. Bondarev said: 'For twenty years of my diplomatic career I have seen different turns of our foreign policy, but never have I been so ashamed of my country as on February 24 of this year. 'The aggressive war unleashed by Putin against Ukraine, and in fact against the entire Western world, is not only a crime against the Ukrainian people, but also, perhaps, the most serious crime against the people of Russia.' The veteran diplomat went on: 'Those who conceived this war want only one thing - to remain in power forever, live in pompous tasteless palaces, sail on yachts comparable in tonnage and cost to the entire Russian Navy, enjoying unlimited power and complete impunity. 'To achieve that they are willing to sacrifice as many lives as it takes. Thousands of Russians and Ukrainians have already died just for this.' According to the UK's ministry of defence, Russia has lost around 15,000 troops since the war began, the same as the Soviet Union lost during nine years in Afghanistan in the 1980s. Bondarev accused the Russian ministry of foreign affairs of 'warmongering, lies and hatred', which he said has left the country with no allies around the world. 'I studied to be a diplomat and have been a diplomat for twenty years,' he said. 'The Ministry has become my home and family. But I simply cannot any longer share in this bloody, witless and absolutely needless ignominy.' In their latest assessment of the war, the MoD suggested the Putin regime is facing serious backlash from the general public over its failures in Ukraine. They tweeted: 'The Russian public has, in the past, proven sensitive to casualties suffered during wars of choice. 'As casualties suffered in Ukraine continue to rise they will become more apparent, and public dissatisfaction with the war and a willingness to voice it may grow.'  Elsewhere, the first war crimes trial since the Russian invasion began has just sentenced a Russian soldier to life imprisonment.   Vadim Shishimarin, a tank commander, was found guilty of killing an unarmed Ukrainian civilian who was riding a bicycle through a village.   This is significant because Moscow has repeatedly denied that it has committed any war crimes through its invasion of Ukraine, despite growing consternation from the rest of the international community.   Ukrainian prosectors have been going to areas such as Bucha where Russian forces were accused of committing a massacre. Ukraine has allegedly opened more than 6,000 cases of war crimes.

And actually, the strains of coronavirus are evolving like never before. We even have five different types of Omicron making the rounds now. Experts have said some of the newer strains, which are increasing in case numbers, need our close attention. Two extra Omicron strains - BA.4 and BA.5 - have now been added to the UK's official list of 'variants of concern'. Here's what there is to know about all the different Omicron types.  What are the different types of Omicron? The original Omiciron strain, dubbed BA.1, drove the winter coronavirus cases, with the sub-lineage BA.2 then causing a subsequent wave earlier this year.  While BA.2 remains the most prevalent version, we also saw a hybrid of the two, named Omicron XE in April. And just for funsies, there were also variants within variants - such as XD and XF which are recombinants of Delta and Omicron BA.1.  And now, we have once again, two more variations of the Omicron original. The latest data from the the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) found that two further Omicron sub-lineages, BA.4 and BA.5, are also making their way around countries. These variations have been added to the list of 'variants of concern', with BA.4 and BA.5 currently fuelling a new wave of Covid in South Africa.  How prevalent are the strains? The latest data from The Office for National Statistics says BA.2 remains dominant in the UK.   In early April, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said there was a total of 637 cases of XE confirmed in the UK. The earliest of these was spotted on January 19, 2022. Later, that figure quickly climbed. In the most recent case count, a total of 1,179 cases of XE were confirmed.    Currently, the newer strains are causing experts to worry. As of May 17, 115 cases of BA.4 and 80 cases of BA.5 have been confirmed in England and the latest  variant technical briefing has been published. Whilst Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 are in the early stages of growth in the UK, analysis of the available data suggests that they are likely to have a growth advantage over the currently-dominant Omicron BA.2 variant. What are the symptoms? Experts at The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), South Africa, say that symptoms of BA.4 and BA.5 don't appear to be different from previous versions. Since these have splintered from Omicron, they aren't a different coronavirus variant (such as Delta) and largely have the same symptoms.  Like the original Omicron strain (BA.1), the primary symptoms of a mild BA.2 infection are a cough, fever, fatigue and possible loss of taste or smell. A runny nose, gastrointestinal issues, headache and a skin rash are other common signs and symptoms. Those are pretty similar to what people experience with a cold or other seasonal viruses.   Don't forget that other Covid symptoms were also added to the NHS last month, including     A high temperature   A new continuous cough   A loss or change to your sense of smell or taste   A shortness of breath   Feeling tired or exhausted   An aching body   A headache   A sore throat   A blocked or runny nose   Loss of appetite   Diarrhoea   Feeling sick or being sick      Should we be worried? There isn't enough data to know the impact of these strains, say experts, as they continue to monitor them to learn more. Dr Meera Chand, director of clinical and emerging infections at , said: 'The reclassification of these variants as variants of concern reflects emerging evidence on the growth of BA.4 and BA.5 internationally and in the UK. Whilst the impact of these variants is uncertain, the variant classification system aims to identify potential risk as early as possible. 'UKHSA is undertaking further detailed studies. Data and analysis will be released in due course through our regular surveillance reporting.' But, experts in South Africa have said that there is little indication that these sublineages would be any more severe than their previous counterparts. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has also said similar. Last week, the EDCD said: 'Based on the limited data currently available, no significant increase in infection severity compared to the circulating lineages BA.1 and BA.2 is expected. 'However, as in previous waves, if Covid-19 case numbers increase substantially, some level of increased hospital and ICU admissions is likely to follow.' So, as a word of caution, it might be best to keep wearing those masks, sanitising your hands and carrying on the provisions of yesteryear.

Chief secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke said the temporary PS20 uplift in the benefit, which was introduced during the pandemic, 'is not going to return'. However, the prime minister's official spokesman later refused to support the minister and insisted 'all options are on the table' for how to help the least well-off cope with soaring bills. Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith is among those calling for a hike in Universal Credit, which tops up the wages of the low paid. But appearing on Radio Four's Today programme, Clarke said: 'On that question, we were always explicitly clear [the PS20 uplift] was a temporary response to the pandemic. 'That is not going to return. The question is how we best now look at the next range of solutions to deal with the challenges we're facing.' Raising benefits is one of the measures the government is looking at as a way of tackling the cost of living crisis. Asked if Clarke was correct to completely rule out the return of the Universal Credit uplift, the PM's spokesman said: 'My understanding is that we are keeping all our options open.' Wendy Chamberlain, the Lib Dem spokesperson on work and pensions, accused ministers of 'refusing to act'. 'This heartless approach will condemn thousands more children to growing up in poverty as the cost of living crunch bites,' she said. 'It shows just how out of touch this Conservative government is with all those struggling to get by. 'Ministers must announce an emergency budget now and reinstate the PS20 uplift to Universal Credit. Every day they fail to act means more families being pushed into debt and struggling to put food on the table.' The row came as the government continues to ponder whether to introduce a windfall tax on the huge profits being enjoyed by oil and gas companies. Speaking at a school in south-west London, Boris Johnson said: 'No option is off the table, let's be absolutely clear about that. 'I'm not attracted, intrinsically, to new taxes. But as I have said throughout, we have got to do what we can - and we will - to look after people through the aftershocks of Covid, through the current pressures on energy prices that we are seeing post-Covid and with what's going on in Russia and we are going to put our arms round people, just as we did during the pandemic.'", "c5651dcb13fc8e90aa9bd56181d665d4d1fe4a367a6216a2e4975b00": "Tributes have been paid to Australian TV presenter Erin Jayne Plummer following her sudden death at the age of 42. Her death was announced by her Studio 10 co-hosts Sarah Harris and Angela Bishop on Monday. 'We've got some really sad news to share this morning,' Sarah began. 'Over the weekend, Studio 10 lost a bit of its sparkle with our friend and advertorial host Erin Jayne passing away suddenly. 'For two decades, Erin Jayne's been a friendly and familiar face on Australian telly and for a lot of that, she's been brightening up our mornings with her bubbly personality and mega-watt smile.' After sharing a montage of Erin Jayne's memorable moments at the Aussie channel, Sarah described her as 'a gorgeous human inside and out'. Sarah continued: 'If it wasn't for TV, perhaps Erin may have had a sporting career. 'She represented Australia in synchronised swimming and even surf life saving, and there's no question that Erin Jayne was a high achiever, and certainly a gold-medal mum to her three young girls.' She concluded: 'We'll miss your sunshine around the studio, Erin Jayne, and all of us here are sending lots of love and strength to her family. You'll be very missed.'

The prime minister's spokesperson said on Monday the face-to-face discussion was 'initially suggested by officials in No.10'. Earlier, Simon Clarke, the chief secretary to the Treasury, told the BBC the controversial meeting was 'instigated' by Gray. And the Daily Mail reported an 'insider' accusing Gray of 'playing politics' and 'enjoying the limelight a little too much'. But No.10 said later this morning while Gray technically sent the 'formal, technical request' for a meeting, it had been Downing Street officials who had first 'suggested it would be helpful' for one to take place. Gray's long-awaited report is finally set to be published this week and could feature photographs of illegal gatherings in Downing Street and Whitehall. No.10 has not revealed what was discussed in the meeting between the prime minister and Gray. Asked if the minutes of the talks would be published, the PM's spokesperson said: 'No, it was a private meeting. We wouldn't publish details of a private meeting.' Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner has called on Johnson to 'urgently explain' why the 'secret meeting' with Gray took place. The Lib Dems will also try to pressure No.10 to publish the minutes by issuing the demand in a 'humble address', a parliamentary procedure used to force government's to release documents. The Gray report will follow the Metropolitan Police inquiry into rule-breaching events in Downing Street and Whitehall during coronavirus restrictions. A total of 83 people were fined for events spanning eight separate days, including the PM, wife Carrie Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak. They all received one fixed penalty notice for an event for Johnson's 56th birthday in June 2020, when indoor mixing was banned.

The Australian star played Charlene Robinson from 1986 to 1988 and the role catapulted her onto the international stage and a music career that is still going strong today. Thirty-four years after she waved goodbye to Ramsay Street, the singer and her co-star Jason Donovan recently returned to the soap to film a scene for the upcoming last episode. In an interview with Australian show Today, Kylie said it just made sense to revisit that part of her life. 'For so long I was like 'well maybe, hmm, I don't know if that makes any sense,'' Kylie said. 'But I'm still in touch with Jason [Donovan] and Guy [Pearce] and Jason said 'this could be a nice opportunity to buckle the buckle' as an ex-boyfriend of mine used to say, or to circle the circle and say thank you.' Kylie said it was emotional driving back into Ramsay Street and all the memories came flooding back for her. 'It was lovely and emotional. Driving into Ramsay Street was quite something,' she said. 'Firstly where has all that time gone? Secondly everything looks exactly the same. Thirdly, Scott, Charlene, Jayne, Harold, it all just came flooding back. 'There was a lot of talking about memories and going back in time.' In the 34 years since she left the show, Kylie has become one of the world's biggest-selling female artists and is the only woman to achieve number one albums in the UK over the last five decades, which she describes as 'crazy'. 'It's crazy. I think of doing my first demo tape when I was 17,' she said. 'I had daytime fantasies about being a singer, I was a pop maniac.

Almost three months since Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, his troops are still yet to secure a solid victory in the neighbouring European country. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has now suggested that Russia is facing serious backlash from the general public over its failures. The UK officials tweeted: 'In the first three months of its 'special military operation', Russia has likely suffered a similar death toll to that experienced by the Soviet Union during its nine-year war in Afghanistan.' This war took place between 1979 and 1989. The Soviet Union invaded to oust the anti-communist guerrillas, with the backing of the Afghan communist government. The Soviets lost nearly 15,000 troops in the bloody conflict and many more were injured. Russia may now have a similar death toll now because of its disorganised approach, according to UK officials. The MoD tweeted: 'A combination of poor low-level tactics, limited air cover, a lack of flexibility, and a command approach which is prepared to reinforce failure and repeat mistakes has led to this high casualty rate, which continues to rise in the Donbas offensive.' Last month, defence secretary Ben Wallace told MPs that not only did he believe around 15,000 Russian personnel had been killed during their offensive, but more than 2,000 armoured vehicles had been destroyed or captured. Although the Kremlin has been determined to suppress any anti-war sentiment across Russia, even shutting down blank-sign protests, the rising death toll could create public opposition difficult to suppress. 'The Russian public has, in the past, proven sensitive to casualties suffered during wars of choice,' the MoD explained. 'As casualties suffered in Ukraine continue to rise they will become more apparent, and public dissatisfaction with the war and a willingness to voice it may grow.' The Kremlin has already been accused of hiding the true scale of troops who have died from the Russian public by the MoD. In April, the UK intelligence suggested that Russia was going to provide compensation payments for the families of the dead through the 'military rather than civilian officials'. It speculated: 'This likely reflects a desire to hide the true scale of Russia's losses from the domestic population.' Elsewhere, the first war crimes trial since the Russian invasion began has just sentenced a Russian soldier to life imprisonment.

At the 2019 general election, Boris Johnson secured an 80-seat majority by managing to unite traditional Labour voters in the north with old-school Tories in the south, thanks largely to his pledge to 'get Brexit done'. As a result, the prime minister now leads a government seemingly wedded to big state intervention on the one hand, while trying to present itself as a tax-cutting administration on the other. Something inevitably had to give, and Labour's calls for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies has proved to be the catalyst. Like a rabbit in the headlights, the Conservatives seem unable to decide how best to address the public's concerns over soaring energy bills and food prices. Opinion polls suggest a one-off levy on the astronomical profits being enjoyed by energy firms, with the billions raised being used to bring down bills, is wildly popular with the public. Nevertheless, a succession of ministers have been forced onto the airwaves in recent weeks to argue against such a move on the grounds that it would deter investment in areas like green technology. Tory MPs were also forced by party bosses to vote against a windfall tax in the Commons last week. Scratch the surface, however, and you quickly realise that there is no unanimity in the Conservative ranks. A succession of MPs from all wings of the party have said, publicly and privately, that they have come round to the idea of a windfall tax. The most recent was former Treasury minister Jesse Norman, who said even Margaret Thatcher would have supported one, given the circumstances. Pointing out that the same companies currently rolling in cash had benefited from taxpayer support when oil prices plummeted in 2014, Norman said: 'Do they think oil and gas companies should enjoy a one-way bet, in which they benefit from public support when prices fall but make no extra contribution when prices rise? 'It is also quite wrong to say that a levy or tax of this kind would be unconservative. On the contrary, it would be both ethically principled and pragmatic. And it would burden future generations less than incurring more debt.' Rob Halfon, a former minister and chair of the education select committee, said: 'I think a windfall tax is the right way forward. We live in extraordinary times. We need to raise money every way we can without increasing the national debt.' Another Tory MP told HuffPost UK: 'The current situation doesn't feel sustainable. The oil and gas companies are making enormous profits out of events that are completely out of their control. How can we be the only people defending them?' Rishi Sunak is understood to have finally come round to the idea of a windfall tax, albeit one which would be applied at a lower rate on those companies which invest more of their profits in new technology. Downing Street, however, remain unconvinced, with two of Johnson's closest advisers, David Canzini and Andrew Griffith believed to be vehemently opposed. According to the Sunday Times, No. 10 communications director Guto Harri has said the choice facing ministers is whether to administer the 'pain relief' of immediate help with people's bills, or to perform 'surgery' to benefit the economy in the long-term. But one Tory MP observed: 'You usually give pain relief before surgery.' An ally of the PM told HuffPost UK: 'We are all exploring every option available to grow the economy and ease the cost of living,' a senior Number 10 source told HuffPost UK. 'It's not the case of one lot advocating and another blocking. 'It's just good government - testing the arguments, exploring the merits, getting the detail right and setting the bar high for doing something no Conservative instinctively wants to do.' Another senior backbencher summed up the dilemma facing the government as it ponders how best to tackle the cost of living crisis. 'Tory MPs are getting fed up of being a high spend, big state party,' the MP said. 'The definite sense of MPs and donors is that people are sick to death of not being a Conservative Party.' Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak must decide whether to bring in a tax to put billions straight into people's pockets, or to turn their back on immediate popularity and stick to the strategy of boosting the economy in the long-term. Their decision will go a long way to deciding the Tories' fate come the next election.", "abe05e284b44b840f0acf048aee6137df9ffe8dd331b5e8678ff913e": "Radio 1 presenter Adele Roberts has said she loves her body 'more than ever' as she appeared on the cover of Women's Health UK with a visible stoma bag. The 43-year-old presenter revealed in October she was undergoing treatment for stomach cancer and later had a tumour removed through surgery. She now uses a stoma bag, which attaches to her abdomen and collects her faeces, and has also been undergoing chemotherapy.   Adele discussed staying strong mentally throughout her treatment during a photoshoot with Women's Health UK. She said: 'Being diagnosed with cancer has meant I've learned to appreciate my body; be grateful that it works; be grateful they found the tumour in time to remove it and be grateful [that modern medicine means I can] have a stoma. 'I feel like I love my body more than ever.' Addressing the importance of talking about cancer, she continued: 'One in two of us will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in our lives and I think the more we can actually talk about it, the less negatively affected people will be mentally, if and when that happens. 'That's why it means so much - as someone undergoing cancer treatment and with a visible stoma - to be on the cover of Women's Health.' Adele admitted she has spent a lot of time feeling 'upset' about her diagnosis and added: 'When I was in hospital, recovering after my surgeries, I would overhear conversations of other women on the ward and learn they had a much worse diagnosis than me - maybe terminal cancer - and that's when I'd feel down.   'I think my strategy, so that I can stay stable while I'm on chemotherapy, is just to get on with it and try and not let it beat me mentally. 'Like, I need to sort of tackle it head-on, because that's how I cope with things, but I understand everyone's different.' Adele, who is bisexual and a campaigner for LGBTQ rights, also recalled meeting her partner Kate for the first time. She said: 'I remember seeing her and just thinking she was beautiful, but I didn't know she was gay; then she mentioned that she was going on a date with a woman and that was it, she couldn't get rid of me!'  Claire Sanderson, editor-in-chief of Women's Health UK, hailed Roberts as a role model. She said: 'Wellness should always be an inclusive space and what better way to embody that than have someone as inspiring as Adele on the cover of Women's Health. It's an empowering, joyful image, full of positivity and spirit. 'Adele truly is a role model - not just within the wellness world, but for all women who have had to face up to serious illnesses like cancer. 'Her mental strength - helped by talking with others and staying physically active - is quite incredible. It's been a privilege to publish and we're incredibly proud to help Adele tell her story.'

On Sunday, anti-poverty organisation Oxfam released a report that found that from March 2020 to March 2022, some 573 people became new billionaires.   Meanwhile, this year alone Oxfam expects more than 260 million people to be pushed into extreme poverty -- or living on less than $1.90 (PS1.51) per day -- worldwide, a rate of one million people falling into extreme poverty every 33 hours.  The COVID-19 pandemic is 'set to drive the biggest systemic increase in income inequality ever seen,' according to the group.  Currently, the world's 10 richest men own more wealth than the bottom 40% of humanity, or 3.1 billion people.  Lockdowns in the UK pushed almost a million people into poverty between spring 2020 and 2021, while over in the US, the Covid related economic crisis left tens of millions of people jobless and struggling financially.  One million people have died in the last two years from coronavirus in the US alone, a staggering loss. Black and Latinx people were about twice as likely to die from the virus than white people. 'It's no accident that we are seeing staggering levels of inequality in the US and globally. It's by deliberate design,' Abby Maxman, Oxfam America's president, said in a release.  'For decades, the ultra-wealthy and corporations have used their economic might to pressure those in power to write the rules so they can avoid taxes, pay poverty wages and skirt responsibility,' Maxman added. 'Meanwhile, working families are feeling the sharp edge of economic insecurity and loss of hope in the future.'  During the pandemic, the over 2,000 billionaires in the world increased their collective worth by $3.78 trillion (PS3.01 trillion) or 42%, in two years.  Currently, the world's billionaires hold wealth equivalent to 13.9% of global Gross Domestic Product -- up from 4.4% of world GDP in 2000.  Meanwhile, the cost of living crisis is gripping the UK, as inflation reaches 10.9% for Britain's poorest. The report had one principal recommendation: tax the rich. Oxfam suggested 'one-off solidarity taxes' on billionaires' increased wealth during the pandemic, as well as a permanent, progressive wealth tax of 2% on wealth above $5 million (PS3.98 million) and 5% for wealth above $1 billion (PS0.8 billion).", "ed29c86def44526191e8246d2a33b4df7ead47123936ad5a511a68e4": "It was Sue Gray who sought a meeting with Boris Johnson to discuss her investigation into partygate, a minister has said. The official's long-awaited report is finally set to be published this week and could feature photographs of illegal gatherings in Downing Street and Whitehall. Over the weekend it was revealed Gray and the prime minister had previously met to talk about her investigation, but there were competing accounts of who asked for the meeting. The BBC said Gray initiated the meeting 'to clarify her intentions' over what would happen once the police investigation concluded. But, a spokesman for the Gray inquiry disputed this account of events. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday, Simon Clarke, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said: 'My understanding is the meeting was held at the instigation of Ms Gray. 'The main thing is we get this report now in short order so we can resolve the final issues of what happened in Downing Street.' On Sunday, cabinet ministers had failed to shed light on the circumstances of the meeting, as Labour said people 'deserve to know the truth'. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi insisted during a round of broadcast interviews he did not know who called the meeting, or what was discussed, International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan also said she did not know who had organised the talks, adding: 'I don't follow anybody's diaries.' Top civil servant Simon Case will reportedly be particularly hard-hit by the contents of Gray's report, despite the fact he was not fined over the scandal. The Daily Telegraph cited a source as saying Case will come in for 'stinging criticism' because 'as the head of the civil service, the ultimate responsibility was his'. Gray's report will be published following the conclusion of a separate inquiry by the police into Covid rule-breaking events at the heart of government It saw a total of 83 people, including Johnson, receive at least one fixed-penalty notice (FPN) each for attending events over eight separate days.", "4ca82f78eade42cd80388cefeb4863b3b10bc0d1c888923bacb5554c": "The government is monitoring the monkeypox outbreak but is currently 'not concerned', according to minister Simon Clarke. The chief secretary to the Treasury was responding to the public worries around the recent uptick in cases now there are 80 cases across 12 countries. The rare viral infection usually does not spread easily between humans, but is common in parts of West and Central Africa. There were only three UK cases reported in 2021, one in 2019 and three in 2018. On Monday, Clarke told Sky News: 'As with any new disease, and after the Covid pandemic, doubly-so, we continue to monitor this very, very closely. ''I think I would say I'm cautious but I'm certainly not concerned about our ability to handle the situation. 'Crucially there is a vaccine available which works for monkeypox, and all the evidence is that it's spread by physical contact. 'That being the case, the risk of community transmission is much lower. We have a working vaccine, if people present the symptoms or they have very close contact, then we are advising that the quarantine for three weeks, but the threshold for that is quite high - it really does need to be close physical contact or sexual contact.' He continued: 'We do urge particular caution with the immunosuppressed, with pregnant women, all the groups who are normally more vulnerable. 'We're cautious but we're certainly not in a position where I would worry about some repeat of Covid because it does not appear to be anywhere near the same platform of seriousness.' Monkeypox has ben compared to smallpox, but it is actually milder, less infectious and less deadly. People usually recover within a week and the virus disappears on its own, prompting no long-term health impacts. However, among a few people a more severe illness can occur. It usually spreads through close physical contact with an infected person. The symptoms include a fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can occur too, starting on the face before moving to other parts of the body. The rash can transform to look like chickenpox or syphilis, before forming scabs which do gradually fall off. People without symptoms are not considered infectious. The UK Health Security Agency has confirmed 20 cases in this outbreak so far in the UK, with further details to be revealed later on Monday.", "e449e4f3dcc110ef042d9e91add93c2f1c95feb8dec78200a9c769be": "If you've got some very old copies of the Harry Potter books stuffed away somewhere then you might want to dig them out. One fan, Helen, was left stunned during an appearance on Sunday's Antiques Roadshow when she brought along a battered old copy of the Philosopher's Stone (complete with detached cover) to be valued. She also brought along a hardback copy of The Chamber Of Secrets, which was in better shape. Despite their condition, Potter fan Helen was told by the show's expert Justin Croft that they could fetch thousands of pounds, despite the state of them. 'These are possibly the worst condition I've seen on the Roadshow,' Justin told her. Crucially, the Chamber of Secrets was a first-edition - and both books had been signed by author JK Rowling. Helen explained: 'Growing up, Harry Potter meant an awful lot to me and my family. 'The Harry Potter paperback I have there I was given in my stocking one year for Christmas and when I started reading it I couldn't put it down. 'When the second book came out JK Rowling came to the Edinburgh book festival and she did a signing afterwards. She signed it for me.' Viewers then saw the Harry Potter author's message, which read: 'To Helen - This is the condition I like to see my books in! (Read).' Referring to the first book, Justin said: 'I think I would say PS1,000 to PS1,500 on this which is really just for the inscription.' Speaking about the second book, he added: 'And this, being a first edition albeit without the dust jacket, PS3,000 to PS3,500.'

And just to up the A-list ante, the two stars were joined by Ryan's wife, actor Blake Lively and Anchorman's Will Ferrell. Alas, the famous foursome's star power didn't rub off on the team, who lost 1-0 to Bromley. Ryan and his mate, fellow actor Rob McElhenney, took full control of the National League club from the Wrexham Supporters Trust in February 2021, investing PS2million under the terms of the deal. Last year, Ryan revealed he had been seeking advice from Becks after buying the local British club. 'If you can just make heavy eye contact with Beckham for... about 20 seconds, your football knowledge grows exponentially,' Ryan joked. 'Sometimes I just FaceTime him and I'm just like, 'Don't speak. Just stare at me''.' Ryan and David struck up a friendship after Ryan's superhero character made a quip about the footballer's voice in Deadpool. Becks later appeared in an online sketch where Deadpool apologised for saying he sounded like he 'mouth-sexed a can of helium'. Since buying the club, Ryan gifted his Wrexham AFC co-owner Rob a urinal at the club's football stadium in the Welsh town, complete with commemorative plaque. The plaque reads: 'This urinal is dedicated to Robert McElhenney on his birthday - April 14.

The internal probe, led by senior civil servant Gray, is set to be published this week now the Metropolitan Police's investigation concluded after handing out 126 fines. However, eyebrows have been raised after prime minister Boris Johnson had a 'secret' meeting with Gray over the report's publication. Sky News presenter Burley subsequently pointed out to Simon Clarke, chief secretary to the Treasury: 'The optics are not good, are they, when the prime minister, has a private meeting with the person who is writing the report.' Clarke replied: ''The civil service is independent, I think it's important that we reaffirm that this process is totally independent of any political pressure.' Burley pushed: 'Who's her boss?' 'Her boss is Simon Case, the cabinet secretary.' She said: 'And who's his boss?' 'Well, ultimately the prime minister is in charge of the government,' but he added: 'The civil service stands apart from the political structures of government.' He continued, claiming Gray is one of the 'most respected' figures in the civil service. Clarke said: 'I do not believe in any way that we should conflate the fact that the prime minister obviously sits atop the whole government, from the fact that the civil service is capable from standing apart from the political issues of the day.' 'The optics are somewhat askew,' Burley pointed out once again. 'I really, really don't think so. There are lots of genuine practical issues, when publishing a report of this nature which has significance not just for the prime minister himself, but for many people who do not have a voice and platform, very junior civil servants, very junior political staffers - the question of whether any of them are named in the report, the questions included within in it. 'The questions are not straightforward here and are genuinely sensitive for people's lives, careers and public profiles.' Burley said: ''But he shouldn't be getting involved in that, should he, if it's an independent report?' 'I do not believe this meeting was anything other than a discussion of the technicalities of the process. It would be genuinely wrong to impugn there has been any pressure put on the nature of this report, in any way.' It's also worth noting that Johnson did actually order the inquiry himself when the partygate revelations started to come to light. He also set the terms of reference for her report, and Gray handed the review to the prime minister first before it was sent to the police to help them conduct their own criminal investigation into the Downing Street lockdown parties.

The Goop founder cleared the rarefied air between herself and the reality TV star, who created her own similarly named company, Poosh, addressing claims that the lifestyle site is a clear rip-off of Paltrow's long-running business.  While soliciting questions from fans via Instagram over the weekend, the Oscar winner was asked, 'Are you upset that Poosh copied you?' Instead of simply skipping the query or possibly even shading Kourtney, Gwyneth chose to unpack why there would be a rivalry between fellow businesswomen in the first place.  'This idea that women need to be in competition is legacy patriarchy bullshit; there is room for EVERY woman to fulfill her dreams,' she wrote.  'I used to fall prey to this kind of thinking years ago, so I understand where it comes from.'  'Now, I get so happy when I see new wellness businesses. There is a place for all of us, plus @kourtneykardash is a really good person,' she continued.   Gwynnie ended her message with the hashtag '#KRAVISFOREVER,' a reference to Kardashian's romance with Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker. The pair are currently in Italy with the rest of the famous family following their European nuptials. When Kourtney first launched her brand back in 2019, many believed it was a Goop copycat, given both contain double O's in their names, hawk highly priced beauty and wellness products, and frequently dabble in pseudo-science. A smattering of articles circulated at the time accusing Poosh of being a 'useless rip-off of Goop' and the reality star of trying to be the 'next Gwyneth Paltrow.'  Kourtney's company, however, is named after her daughter Penelope, who goes by the nickname Poosh. And, in case you needed any more evidence that there's no bad blood between the two stars, look no further than Travis's recent house tour.  While showing off his bedroom to Architectural Digest, Goop's infamous 'This Smells Like My Orgasm' candle sits on the drummer's bedside table. Except, however, the label on his candle reads, 'This Smells Like Kourtney's Orgasm,' which presumably means he received a custom order from Gwyneth herself.

Feel like you should be doing something all the time, that you're not doing enough unless you're overwhelmed?  That performance anxiety causes many of us to overwork, and it could be a sign of productivity paralysis during our paid working hours.  Most of us will have experienced it at some point; an ever-growing to-do list that's gnawing away at us. Despite its growth, the more we have to do, the more unable we are to start ticking it off.  Productivity anxiety is on the rise and only becoming more pervasive in the wake of the pandemic. According to Microsoft research, 59% of women feel they are not able to do, be, or achieve enough compared to less than two in five men (37%).  And when we feel like we're not being productive enough during our scheduled work hours, many of us spend extra time logged on to compensate. You end up staying in a little longer, taking a shorter lunch break, or maybe even working on a weekend (this might not look like a completely rigid shift, but checking in your emails, firing them off, checking and writing updates, fulfilling tasks).  But professional ennui and paralysis is a normal part of our work lives - we all experience lulls in productivity. So why do we punish ourselves for it?  We're expected to regulate our emotion at work - whether it's listlessness, anger, upset - without affecting our output, but we're human, our emotional state is likely to spill into our corporate tasks. So when feelings of overwhelm come, it's okay to take a step back without feeling you need to later throw yourself at work. Your emotions at work don't need to be compensated. Hannah Oliver, 23, from Leicester, works in the engineering industry and says she can relate to overworking as compensation for productivity lulls.  She tells HuffPost UK: 'I'm trying to find a good balance between making the most of my current motivated phase - before another period of productivity paralysis - and not overworking and burning out. 'I get seemingly random peaks and troughs of productivity. I haven't yet figured out a trend as I'm still not actually officially diagnosed with ADHD. But I tend to get a few weeks of extreme motivation where I want to do everything and then a few weeks of being unable to do anything at all until deadlines get super close and my anxiety takes over and I have to power through.' So how does Oliver deal with it? 'I think accepting its cause helps, because you can then accept you aren't lazy, but it's hard and often I just have to ride it out.' Joe Ryle, director of the 4-day week campaign, says there's a solution to not feeling overwhelmed by work: being rested.  'Working too much often leads to productivity paralysis so the answer is a shorter working week,' he tells HuffPost UK.  'A rested worker is a better worker. By reducing the working week we can give our brains a rest which then allows us to perform more effectively and creatively at work.' But won't that mean you're even more swamped on the days you work, leading to overwhelm? Well, it's about an overhaul of our work culture, says Ryle, so that the team is working more effectively. So if a company moves to a four-day structure, it might mean a division of tasks so that everyone has a manageable plate. They then also have enough downtime so when they return to work, they can apply themselves fully. Ryle adds: 'The UK has an acute problem when it comes to working hours as we work some of the longest hours in Europe while having one of the least productive economies. 'Working all the time is bad for productivity. We need a four-day working week with no loss of pay. No one should be working longer than 32 hours a week.' Next time you feel burnt out and under pressure to perform but are unable to, remember that it's normal, it'll pass and you don't need to punish yourself or overwork yourself to 'make up' for it. That will only leave you in a cycle of burnout.

Can't help but laugh at a kid falling over and dropping their ice cream? Unable to hide your delight at seeing the failures of the powerful but incompetent? Or the gratification that comes with watching a smarmy celeb get humbled?  There's a delicious satisfaction in watching people you don't like, or even sometimes those you do, squirm, struggle, and underperform in life. The pleasure derived from other people's misfortune is called schadenfreude and though we hate to admit it, most of us have experienced it at some point. Sure, we want the best for the people around us, but occasionally, witnessing them fumble feels good too. We don't mean on a monumental level - most of us still want our friends and acquaintances to thrive - but seeing those little losses allows us to feel superior or can spark that sense that 'it serves them right'. It can also reinforce that we're all fallible, prone to mistakes and failures, which can even inspire a sense of camaraderie. So, what exactly is going through our brains when we experience schadenfreude? Firstly, let's understand where this word comes from. Schadenfreude is a combination of the German nouns schaden, meaning damage or harm, and freude, meaning joy - so the experience of joy at someone's misfortune.  And it goes quite far back - its first known use dating to 1868. But in the last decade, scientists have really got stuck into exploring the phenomena.  In 2015, lab experts in Germany identified a series case of schadenfreude when they tested a group of local football fans. Psychologists found that the German supporters experienced greater joy at watching their rivals, the Dutch, miss a goal than they did at watching their own team score.  In 2020, University College London published a paper in the journal Nature, marking the same sensation (though it wasn't what they'd started off studying). In the UCL experiment, participants were shown two groups of people - those who cheated on a game (bad) and those who didn't (good) - each suffer a painful stimulus. When they watched the good group endure pain, the so-called 'empathy circus' in their brains lit up in both male and female participants.  Watching the bad cohort, however, male participants didn't feel any empathy, though women showed at little. And in the men, the reward centre in the left nucleus accumbens (a major component of the brain's reward circuit) lit up at the sight of the pain - making the case for them feeling schadenfreude. So, why do we experience schadenfreude? Dr. Joseph Shrand, a medical officer and lecturer of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, tells HuffPost UK that it's normal for us all to laugh at someone's misfortune from time to time. He explains: 'There is an interaction between an ancient, primitive, impulsive, irrational part of our brain, in general called the limbic system, and the more evolved and modern part of our brain right behind our forehead, the pre-frontal cortex (PFC) at play in schadenfreude. 'The delight we experience is sparked by our limbic brain, which then activates our PFC. For most of us, the same part of the PFC feels some empathy and sadness for the unsuspecting person on whom the misfortune befell. But not everyone.' When does schadenfreude become a problem? For some people who do not have as much empathy, the joy they experience in someone else's misfortune persists,' says Dr Shand. However, those who continually find joy in others' pain could be masking their own, Dr Shrand suggests. 'Some of these people may have experienced even worse tragedies and trauma, which led them to feel less valuable, and take greater and long lasting pleasure in another's misfortune,' he says. 'This is not about morality, it is about mortality - simply the way a traumatised brain reacts to a world in which mistrust, devaluation, and disrespect have dominated their lives.' Show that person they have value and respect and the schadenfreude may fade. 'When that person begins to feel valued again, they can begin to trust again and rekindle empathy,' says Dr Shrand. 'They may still laugh at the silliness of the event, but can then feel the compassion the vast majority of human beings feel when we see another's misfortune.'", "5807c3d4c2d4178c0a0a10902c4d86f4b2b7cef93c7ac265e91d4e52": "Conservative calls for a windfall tax are growing louder after a former Treasury minister claimed that even Margaret Thatcher would have introduced one if faced with the current cost of living crisis. Jesse Norman, who served as financial secretary to the Treasury from 2019 until last year, said 'few would embrace the idea in normal times' but that the arguments against a windfall tax were 'at present very weak'. The government is under pressure to help families who are struggling with the soaring price of fuel and energy bills, in part caused Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Education secretary Nadhim Zahawi said on Sunday that the Cabinet was considering 'all the options' to combat the cost-of-living crisis, including a temporary levy on firms that have benefited from the boom in oil and gas prices. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, is understood to be warming to the idea but he faces opposition from ministers including international trade secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan, Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis, health secretary Sajid Javid and Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg. In a Twitter thread, Norman said the move would not be without precedent, citing the bank levy imposed by former chancellor George Osborne in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. The MP for Hereford and South Hertfordshire also said that former prime minster and free market advocate Thatcher had effectively imposed a windfal tax with one-off levies on banks and oil firms in the early 1980s. A windfall tax would not defer investment as some ministers have claimed when arguing against the idea, Norman added. And he said: 'It is also quite wrong to say that a levy or tax of this kind would be unconservative. 'On the contrary, it would be both ethically principled and pragmatic. And it would burden future generations less than incurring more debt.' He added: 'There is no such thing as a perfectly free market, and preserving the benefits of free exchange and open markets requires intelligent flexibility in times of crisis from government. 'This would not breach that norm. Indeed it would reinforce it. 'Finally, for what it is worth, although she rightly would not have liked the idea much, I have no doubt Margaret Thatcher in her pragmatic prime would have levied a limited and temporary tax of this kind. 'Indeed she more or less did, in 1981 and again in 1982.' Norman's intervention comes as Michael Lewis, the chief executive of E.ON UK, urged the government to 'tax those with the broadest shoulders' as means to curb the energy crisis. He told BBC One's Sunday Morning TV show: 'Well, for us, the most important thing is that the government intervenes, it's up to the government to decide how they fund that. 'All I would say is that it's important that, when they are taxing to address this challenge, that they tax those with the broadest shoulders.' Lewis said he had seen a 'significant number' of people fall into in fuel poverty, defined as when more than 10% of their disposable income is spent on energy. He said that figure has now risen to 20% and could rise to 40% 'if the government doesn't intervene in some way'. Asked about the likelihood of a windfall tax coming into force, Zahawi said the Cabinet will 'look at all the options'. However, he warned that imposing a windfall tax could negatively effect elderly people if firms are then forced to reduce or withdraw their dividends. 'We want to see their investment but also remember it's pensioners who basically get the dividend from these companies, and if they're going to cut their dividend because they have had a windfall tax, then that'll make a difference to pensioners,' he told Sky News. 'Investment has to be real, which is what I think Rishi [Sunak] will demand of all these companies and to see a roadmap towards that investment. 'We're not taking any options off the table.' Trevelyan also told Times Radio she believed that the government should energy producers to invest their profits in green alternatives rather than imposing the tax. 'As the chancellor said, it's really important that he's able to keep everything under review. 'He has set out a very clear position that he wants these energy companies, as they have made unexpectedly higher profits because of these price hikes, that they use that to invest in the clean energies of the future.'", "72793386143b92757d79360f2804f93a9dbf1ee5325434830d81c5cd": "Cabinet minister Nadhim Zahawi has spoken out about how he was dunked in a pond and racially abused by bullies when he was at school. The education secretary, who came to the UK after fleeing from Iraq, said the experience was 'pretty horrific for a child who has just arrived on these shores'. Zahawi spoke about his own experience after he was asked about the case of 11-year-old Raheem Bailey, who lost his finger while trying to escape from bullies. His mother, Shantal Bailey, said her son got his finger caught in a fence while trying to escape bullies. His finger then had to be amputated. Zahawi described Raheem's treatment as 'sickening'.  Bailey said her son has endured 'racial and physical abuse' as well as taunts about his height since he started secondary school at Abertillery Learning Community in South Wales in September, according to his mother. Asked about Raheem's case on Sky News, Zahawi, told presenter Sophy Ridge: 'It's sickening, we always need to do more.   'I suffered bullying when I first arrived on these shores. 'I couldn't speak English and it was hard, I remember my first experience... being chased around the park as a sort of entertainment for bigger boys and then throwing me in the pond or dunking my head down in the pond -- pretty horrific for a child who has just arrived on these shores.' Asked if there was a racist element to the bullying, Zahawi replied: 'I don't know, it was a long time ago, but I've certainly been on the receiving end of other racist slurs, words, whatever - I was called a 'Paki' at school, I had to explain they mean I'm from Pakistan, I'm not from Pakistan, I'm actually from a place called Iraq and I'm Kurdish of origin, it's called Kurdistan. 'It's a horrible thing and I'm determined to stamp it out, as I'm determined to stamp out antisemitism in our schools or in our universities. 'There's no place for racism anywhere in our society, let alone in education.' The Welsh government has released a statement since Raheem's case came to light. It read: 'We condemn bullying and racial harassment in any form and expect allegations and incidents of bullying and racism to be fully investigated by schools with appropriate action taken to address the matter and prevent further instances from happening. 'We understand that this incident is being investigated by the school and the local authority, and that Gwent Police are involved and carrying out an investigation.' A spokeswoman for Abertillery Learning Community said the school was working close with Gwent Police and the local council to establish what happened.

Khan, the former MP for Wakefield, was convicted of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy earlier this month, a move that triggered his resignation from the seat and an upcoming by-election. Former justice minister Crispin Blunt caused controversy when he defended Khan immediately following his conviction, saying he was the victim of a 'dreadful miscarriage of justice'. Following an outcry Blunt then apologised and withdrew his statement, saying he did not 'condone any form of abuse and I strongly believe in the independence and integrity of the justice system'. However, despite then offering his resignation as chair of an all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on LGBT issues, Blunt has now backtracked and defended his original comments. In an interview with BBC One's Politics South East programme on Sunday, Blunt said: 'I didn't know Imran - I got to know him in the first few weeks of 2019 and 2020 and thoroughly enjoyed his company and could well see why he'd be a terrific parliamentarian with an enormous amount to contribute.' Blunt admitted he did not attend the whole trial, but said: 'I know what decisions were made within the trial, which meant that, in my judgment, he did not get a fair trial or anything remotely like that.' Pressed on whether he still believes that to be the case he said: 'Yes, I do.' Asked if he thought he knew more than the jury, he said: 'Yes inevitably, because quite a lot of the trial was conducted without the jury being present.' He added that it remains his judgment that he had seen 'a serious miscarriage of justice'. 'Of course, the justice process is not complete, because ... Imran has the opportunity to appeal the conviction,' he continued. 'And I remain very confident that a justice system worthy of the name will restore his good name. 'The victims ... who have been victims of sexual assault will obviously have felt immensely strongly about the nature of my statement. But it is perhaps [in- the nature of some of my politics ... to seek to make the case ... for people whom others won't.' Earlier this month, Blunt also revealed that he would stand down as the MP for Reigate at the next election after 25 years in parliament. Southwark Crown Court heard how Khan forced his 15-year-old victim to drink gin and tonic, dragged him upstairs in the house they were staying at, pushed him on to a bed and asked him to watch pornography before the attack at a house in Staffordshire in January 2008. Khan finally quit as an MP at the beginning of this month, triggering a by-election in Wakefield which he took from Labour in the 2019 general election. The contest will be held on June 23, as will a separate by-election in Tiverton and Honiton following Neil Parish's decision to quit over revelations he watched porn on his phone in the House of Commons chamber.

Laura has played Dr. Ellie Sattler in three of the franchise's releases, including the latest, Jurassic World Dominion, alongside Sam as her boyfriend, Dr. Alan Grant. In a new interview with The Sunday Times, the actors address their twenty year age-gap. 'At the time [it] was a completely appropriate age difference for a leading man and lady,' Sam, who is now 74, told the newspaper. 'It never occurred to me until I opened a magazine and there was an article called 'Old geezers and gals'. People like Harrison Ford and Sean Connery acting with much younger people. And there I was, on the list. I thought, 'Come on. It can't be true'.' Despite the age gap, Laura insists it felt 'completely appropriate to fall in love with Sam Neill'. The 55-year-old added: 'And it was only now, when we returned in a moment of cultural awareness about the patriarchy, that I was, like, 'Wow! We're not the same age?'' The two stars also talked about how the latest release in the franchise differs from the original, which took 45 minutes for anyone to catch a glimpse of one of the dinosaurs. 'An audience 30 years later wouldn't find that pace acceptable,' Sam says. 'As a result this has action from the moment the lights go down. Though of course it has quiet moments.'  Laura then teases: 'It's very romantic.' Jurassic Park Dominion is in cinemas from 10 June.

In an excruciating interview on Sky News, the education secretary repeatedly dodged questions on who set up the talks. News of the meeting emerged as Gray, who is a senior civil servant, prepares to finally publish her long-awaited report into lockdown-busting parties is Downing Street and Whitehall next week. Downing Street initially suggested Gray had arranged the meeting, which took place last month, but that was denied by her officials. Appearing on Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Zahawi was asked three times who had arranged the meeting, but each time failed to answer. He said: 'All I can say to you is the meeting that took place between Sue Gray and the Prime Minister - I can't tell you who called the meeting.' He later added: 'I don't know who called the meeting.' Asked what was discussed, he also said: 'I don't know.' Asked if he could not say who called the meeting because he did not ask No 10, or because it did not tell him, Mr Zahawi said: '(I'll) tell you what the answer is, the answer is very simple. 'The answer is the Prime Minister will never intervene in Sue Gray's investigation. The Prime Minister wants Sue Gray to basically go wherever the evidence takes her.' Zahawi later clashed with the BBC's Jo Coburn, accusing her of 'throwing mud' over the meeting. Coburn asked: 'We now know that several weeks ago, the prime minister had a secret meeting with Sue Gray, the senior civil servant responsible for writing the report into the partygate scandal that could determine his political future. 'Who called that meeting?' Zahawi hit back: 'Hold on a second, you just called it a secret meeting -- the prime minister meets his senior civil servants all the time.' Zahawi repeatedly said he 'did not know' why the meeting was held and added: 'I don't believe it is material to the outcome of the investigation ... because the PM has always said that Sue Gray can take the report to wherever the evidence takes her. 'She is independent, the prime minister will never intervene with the investigation.' Coburn replied: 'You say he would never do that, but political influence is what people will be asking.' Reports of the meeting come just days before Gray is due to release her full report into the partygate scandal that has rocked Downing Street. Gray has already published an interim report in the scandal which blamed 'failures of leadership and judgment' for the pandemic rule-breaking, but she was unable to publish a full report while the Metropolitan police investigation was ongoing. That inquiry has now ended and a total of 126 fines were issued to 83 people, including Johnson and his wife, Carrie. He has been told he will face no further action.  Coburn said that the public 'need to know' who called the meeting between the PM and Sue Gray and what happened. But Zahawi said: 'His diary has many meetings. 'You're throwing mud at something which doesn't exist.'  Following reports of the meeting, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said: 'Boris Johnson must urgently explain why he held a secret meeting with Sue Gray to discuss her report despite claiming her investigation was completely independent.   'Public confidence in the process is already depleted, and people deserve to know the truth.   'This is a prime minister incapable of taking responsibility for the rotten culture he has created in Downing Street or of doing the decent thing.   'The Sue Gray report must be published in full and with all accompanying evidence.' Around 30 people, including Johnson, are now being contacted by the Cabinet Office to warn them of the contents of the Gray's report before it is published next week.  They have until 5pm on Sunday to submit any objections.", "aa2a2da4daa2d1573905b4f6f202963c312cfbd2e969f8322ba7ce69": "Ever since Harry Styles broke away from his boyband past and launched his solo career, the comparisons to older, iconic stars have come thick and fast. David Bowie, Freddie Mercury, Prince and Mick Jagger have all obviously been an influence on Harry's style - both musically and sartorially. Now the Rolling Stones frontman has given his verdict on Harry channelling his early-Seventies look. When asked about the similarities, the 78-year-old rocker told the Sunday Times that he has a 'superficial resemblance'.  'I like Harry -- we have an easy relationship,' her told the newspaper.  'I mean, I used to wear a lot more eye make-up than him. Come on, I was much more androgynous. And he doesn't have a voice like mine or move on stage like me; he just has a superficial resemblance to my younger self, which is fine -- he can't help that.' Harry released his third album, Harry's House, on Friday to huge critical acclaim and will be showcasing many of the new songs at a special one-off gig at Brixton's O2 Academy on Tuesday. The critics are unanimous in their praise for singer's third long player, describing it as 'undoubtedly his best record yet'. Last week, Harry opened up about his two forthcoming films, revealing that he had a 'pre-negotiated' penis clause in his contract. Later this year, the singer will be seen alongside Emma Corrin in a big-screen adaptation of the novel My Policeman, as well as the psychological thriller Don't Worry Darling. Speaking on The Howard Stern Show on SiriusXM (via ET), Harry said he appears naked in My Policeman, but did not bare all on camera due to his contract. 'It does feel vulnerable. I'd never kissed anyone on camera before and it felt like giving a part of myself away in some ways,' he said. 'I wasn't naked in Don't Worry Darling. I was naked in My Policeman. There's no peen in the final cut. There's bum bum... I don't think the peen was intended to be involved.

Yes, they happened, but the vast majority of people who had already had Covid likely wouldn't contract the virus again anytime soon.  But recent data suggest reinfections are becoming more common, especially as new variants take hold. The uptick in reinfections is likely influenced by two factors: one, that newer variants can evade the antibody response and reinfect, and two, that we're now documenting reinfections more rigorously and getting a more accurate picture of how frequent they are. Coronaviruses are known to infect people over and over again. In fact, it's widely believed that the common cold coronaviruses that circulate today (and reinfect people frequently) originated from previous coronavirus epidemics.  Many infectious disease doctors suspect that, as with those strains, we may be susceptible to reinfections but that the symptoms will become milder and milder with time.  'As get more immunity, as our T-cells diversity and broaden, hopefully our second reinfection will not feel as bad as the first infection,' said Monica Gandhi, an infectious diseases specialist with the University of California, San Francisco.  Here's how soon reinfections can occur with Covid now We now know that antibodies, which work to prevent infection in the first place, begin to dip a few months after vaccination or infection. In addition, as the coronavirus mutated, it became slightly less recognisable to the immune system.  Because of this, variants are able to outwit the immune system's first line of defense and reinfect us, according to Julie Parsonnet, an epidemiologist and professor of infectious diseases at Stanford University School of Medicine.  'With Omicron, we are seeing many cases in previously infected people, even when they had been vaccinated as well,' Parsonnet said. Pablo Penaloza-MacMaster, an assistant professor of microbiology-immunology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, said that people who recently recovered from an infection or got boosted may be susceptible to reinfection in about six months. Parsonnet noted she's heard of at least one patient who was fully vaccinated and double-boosted getting infected with omicron six weeks after their previous infection. A recent study from Denmark found that, though very rare, reinfections with omicron subvariants can occur in as little as 20 days. Of the 1.8 million infections recorded between November 2021 and February 2022, 1,739 reinfections were detected within 60 days.  This doesn't mean that a couple of months after recovering, there's a good chance you'll get Covid again. In fact, a pre-print study recently found that infections in people who have already had Covid were 90% less common than in people who had never been infected. Getting infected on top of the vaccine really boosts your antibody levels, and that should keep most people well-protected from infection for at least four months, Gandhi said. Identifying who may be more likely to get reinfected isn't an exact science - some people will be better protected and less at risk for reinfections depending on factors like their age, genetics and underlying health. The rate of reinfection also depends on the variant - the type of mutations the virus has picked up - and the viral load someone's exposed to, according to Penaloza-MacMaster. Reinfection tends to be less severe The bulk of evidence suggests that COVID reinfections, in general, tend to be less severe than the initial infection. In the Danish study, almost everyone who had been reinfected with BA.2 after previously having BA.1 experienced mild symptoms for a few days and significantly lower viral loads the second time around -- even those who were unvaccinated. Even though our immune system weakens with time, the components that keep us safe from illness and severe outcomes remain robust and long-lasting (even when dealing with new variants).  'Reinfections, especially in vaccinated individuals, are typically milder relative to the primary infection, because there is already an arsenal of memory T-cells and B-cells,' Penaloza-MacMaster said. Research suggests reinfections and boosters enhance the T-cell response. 'As you would expect, a reinfection fundamentally protects you even more' from severe outcomes, Gandhi said. Of course, boosters are the safest -- you don't want to purposefully get reinfected. According to Penaloza-MacMaster, the severity of an individual's reinfection is also influenced by the variant they contract along with the dose of virus they are exposed to and whether they have underlying health conditions that put them at risk. But, often, it can be unpredictable.  How will reinfections impact long COVID? One of the key questions epidemiologists will track is how reinfections contribute to long Covid.  We know that Covid affects many organs, including the brain, lungs and heart. Inflammation, which helps clear infected cells from the body, is a normal part of the body's response to infections. When the body kills off virally infected cells, it also destroys our own healthy cells.  'Eliminating a virus involves a substantial amount of 'collateral damage,' which is a main reason why long-term inflammation - which happens during protracted infections - is harmful,' Penaloza-MacMaster said.  If and how reinfections contribute to long Covid and potential damage to our organs is unclear. Research has found that vaccination reduced the risk of long Covid in people who had a breakthrough infection, Gandhi said. And while the vast majority of people who contract SARS-CoV-2 recover well without long-term consequences, it isn't yet known whether this will continue to be the case after multiple infections. 'We don't know the answer to this question, especially because as variants change and our immune systems react differently to them, their impacts on the body many change,' Parsonnet said.    Experts are still learning about Covid-19. The information in this story is what was known or available at the time of publication, but guidance could change as scientists discover more about the virus.

Eddie, who regularly appeared on Celebrity Gogglebox with the former Big Breakfast presenter, says he is 'deeply ashamed' of his behaviour but insists he will 'always love' Denise. The couple split in January after Denise discovered Eddie had been sexting other women on his iPad. In an interview with The Sun, Eddie says that after uncovering the messages, the TV star 'was in a rage, screaming obscenities at me' as she threw him out of the home they shared in Essex. Eddie - who dated Denise for seven years - said: 'As I left I knew it was going to be the last time I would ever see her. I was absolutely gutted. 'I hurt Denise, I broke her trust and I'm deeply sorry. I deeply regret that I sent those messages. 'I've tried to apologise to Denise. I've sent her untold messages on text, on email, saying that I love her and that I'm sorry for what I've done -- that I'm embarrassed and I'm ashamed.' Eddie says he initially thought that their relationship was strong enough to withstand his mistake but he turned to alcohol when he realised it was all over. 'As far as Denise is concerned, the trust between us is broken and I have to respect that,' he said. Eddie says that it's only recently that he's begun to turn his life around following the break-up. 'I have been in a dark place, and it's only in the past few weeks that I've begun to feel more positive,' he says. 'I've stopped drinking alcohol and have been exercising more.' He added: 'I will always love Denise. I hope she finds someone who will treat her right and not betray her trust. But I hope now we can both leave the past behind.' Denise confirmed she had split from Eddie in January in an Instagram post. She wrote: 'Over the past couple of months, there has been much speculation regarding my relationship with Eddie.

Piers, who used to sit on the judging panel of the ITV talent show from 2007 until 2010, didn't hold back following the latest episode. The TalkTV presenter has previously described David as a 'treacherous piece of work' and 'a snivelling today', and he couldn't resist having yet another dig at the former Little Britain star on Saturday night. 'Love the judging panel on @BGT - apart from David Walliams,' he tweeted. 'All he does is drip & drool unctuously sycophantic drivel, and he's soooooo creepy.' It's Piers' latest attempt to try and get a rise out of David, who has kept his opinion about Piers (mostly) to himself. Back in 2019, Piers called out the comedian and author after he liked a tweet that referenced the fake war torture pictures published in the Mirror that led to Piers losing his job as the editor of the newspaper in 2004. Sharing a screen grab of the tweet, which was liked by David and actress Amanda Abbington, Piers wrote: 'Amusing that @davidwalliams regularly 'likes' the nastiest tweets about me, yet is such a snivelling toady to my face. It's not my fault @BGT ratings were so much higher when I was in your chair Dave!' Although David never responded, his former Little Britain co-star Matt Lucas jumped to his defence. Matt tweeted at the time: 'Purely objectively - 1) He was probably being polite. Some people are. 2) Boasting about the BGT ratings and popularity when you were briefly on it to someone who has not only transformed the show but is consistently the biggest-selling author in the country didn't work.' Meanwhile, BGT bosses have defended the acts on this year's series, after it was revealed that around a quarter of them are professional performers or already have links to the show.

To reaffirm their gender, trans women also take oestrogen - the same hormone cis women take when combatting menopause symptoms - meaning they are also being affected by the same shortfalls in supply. Three different types of medication that provide oestrogen - Oestrogel (a brand of estradiol gel), Ovestin cream, estradiol patches and Premique tablets - are in short supply and there is 'no accurate information on when these will be back in widely available stock', one online pharmacist told HuffPost UK. At the moment, the government has predicted the shortage will last until the end of July, but this is expected to be extended. Approximately a million cis women are thought to be suffering from the shortage. The exact number of trans people affected remains unclear. HuffPost UK spoke to trans women and charities about these serious challenges and just how HRT is important to them. Here's what we found. 'I've never had a feeling like it' jane fae* is a trans woman who has been on HRT for years, and the director of the charity TransActual. The 64-year-old from Hertfordshire believes the recent efforts to advocate HRT have targeted cis women, meaning trans women feel left out in the cold. Now, she worries the trans community is being blamed for the shortage. This concern was echoed by trans charity Gendered Intelligence, which told HuffPost UK that rather than 'disregarding these shortages as a trans issue, or worse, treating trans people as the cause of the shortages, we should be fighting for proper healthcare for everyone'. The charity has heard of shortages among the community it supports, with some of its own team members also personally impacted.  fae estimated there's just a fraction of trans women compared to the number of cis women who are on HRT - but that life without it is equally hard. Although she hasn't personally been impacted by the current shortage, she explained that when she came off HRT prior to gender reassignment surgery, she 'hit an absolute wall', which affected her 'physically and mentally'. 'If you come off HRT, your body has adjusted so you get both physical withdrawal symptoms and it does seem to be a mood effector. For a lot of people, it tips them into a pretty instant mood depressor. 'When I had to come off mine for a few weeks, it was horrid, it really was horrid. I've never really had a feeling like it,' she explained. Luckily, these effects were reversible when fae went back on the hormones after surgery. She explained the important psychological impact of taking HRT too, saying: 'Before you're given hormones, you can feel as though you're just someone who claims to be trans.  'The mere fact of being given hormones is intensely validating, you've got through the processes now, supposed experts believe you. And because it's got that validating function if something gets in the way of hormones then it sort of... feels like you've been knocked back. De-validated.' Jamie*, an 18-year-old from Manchester, has been personally impacted by the HRT shortage. She was previously using estradiol gel and says she knows a lot of trans women who were moved onto gel because of a shortage in estradiol patches. However, shortages for the gel then began. Thankfully, Jamie was able to switch to an oral estradiol pill before her prescription completely ran out, but the disruption in HRT supplies was still stressful.  'Initially I was extremely anxious, since I didn't know how my provider would work around the shortage, but after switching totally to pills and maintaining similar levels my mental health has been fine,' she said. Physically, Jamie's switch from one form of HRT to another has thankfully been smooth sailing, but she said this isn't the case for all trans women.  'I know some other trans people who don't absorb pills well, and they were forced to [switch to] either injections or patches. The former requires a fair amount of hassle, since you usually need somebody trained and willing to inject, and many GPs won't do it for private HRT. Some of the people I know who switched had a massive drop in oestrogen levels, which was not great for them,' she said.  'The switch [from gel to pills] did mean I needed to get an extra blood test one month after my prescription fill to check my levels, which since my GP will not perform, I had to pay for.' Guilia Guerrini, lead pharmacist from digital pharmacy Medino, told HuffPost UK that suddenly coming off HRT can have serious adverse effects. 'For both cis and trans women, interrupting treatment with HRT can certainly cause the body to respond in different ways,' she said. 'Since hormones are involved in regulating mood, emotions and behaviour, it isn't surprising to hear that depression is one of the main consequences of suddenly not taking HRT anymore.' Guerrini added: 'Hormones also affect our bodies and sexual drives, so going cold turkey could have a negative effect on that. I would say that especially if you are beginning a rather emotional journey that involves taking HRT, such as going through the transitioning process, it can be even more devastating to suddenly have to stop or face shortages.' Speaking to the i newspaper during the last significant HRT shortages in 2019, consultant endocrinologist Dr Leighton Seal, from London's Gender Identity Clinic, explained the impact of unintended withdrawal varies according to the stage of transition a woman is in. If a trans woman hasn't had gender reassignment surgery and is not on a blocker for male hormones, there may be a risk of male features returning without HRT. For those who have had the surgery or are on the male-hormone blockers, being without would cause a trans woman to 'go into a menopausal state'. She might experience hot flushes, tiredness, mood instability, and her transition would come to a halt - meaning her breast development and skin softening would stall. Dr Seal told the i: 'That may have more of an impact on her than a woman who's using HRT to alleviate the symptoms of menopause.' Long-term withdrawal from HRT stretching out over more than a few months can also cause osteoporosis and cardiovascular issues, according to the doctor. What about people who have only recently started using HRT? Priya*, 55, a cis woman who is on HRT herself to ease her symptoms of perimenopause, told HuffPost UK about how her access to the hormones compares to the situation for her daughter, 17, who takes HRT because she is transitioning. 'We had a bit of nightmare with her,' she said. When she first started picking up the prescription for her daughter's Oestrogel back in September from their local independent pharmacy, Priya said there wasn't an issue. But, the decline in supply meant her daughter has since had a one-month gap in her hormone supply, which 'definitely' had a negative impact on her mental health, as well as prompting 'worry and concern' within their family about the immediate future. 'We're now really worried about the next round of supply and whether we will get Oestrogel,' Priya added. Her daughter accesses her HRT via private prescriptions, because, in Priya's words, the NHS 'isn't functional at the moment' with long waiting times for support.  NHS Guidelines say 18 weeks is the limit from referral to treatment. In reality, theaverage waiting time for a first appointment with a gender identity clinic is 18months, according to evidence submitted to the government by the LGBT Foundation. Other groups say waits are even longer. The NHS has committed to cutting waiting times.  Priya had to take her daughter to around 10 pharmacies before finding a place which had any of the available hormones. 'There was a pharmacy that could get the drugs at the end of last year but they were too highly priced, we couldn't manage it,' Priya added, illuminating how the cost discrepancies can have a huge impact too. Her daughter's private prescription costs around PS300 for a three month supply of Estradiol along with Syneral (a hormone blocker), she said, adding that prices have soared recently.  By contrast, Priya pays the standard NHS prescription charge of PS9.35 a month for her own perimenopause HRT. Plans announced to cut NHS HRT costs further are expected to be rolled out in 2023.  Priya explained the 'admin and management of it takes up a lot of mental energy because you have to put reminders in and assess what you've got'. Even so, she said it 'definitely' looks like their family will have to 'ration out' their HRT supply.  Some trans women have been able to access NHS prescriptions, though - jane fae confirmed she was able to pay the standard prescription rate for her HRT access. At the moment, pharmacists are only allowed to dispense a maximum of three months to avoid treatment disruptions. If a particular hormone is not available, patients might be prescribed alternative treatments, or a combination of products. While they were able to eventually turn to Boots to get the prescription, Priya noted: 'Independent pharmacies can't get a supply, so then it becomes a postcode lottery.' Trans youth charity, Mermaids, also shone a light on how difficult it's been for young people. Head of policy and research Kai O'Doherty, told HuffPost UK: 'The majority of the people we support do not even have access to hormones. 'Under 16s are not prescribed HRT, and even those over 16 who are able to obtain access are forced to endure NHS waiting times upwards of three years for an initial appointment. 'Unfortunately, accessing any gender healthcare services right now is incredibly difficult for our young people with numerous delays and this illustrates why we need an overhaul of the current gender services to ensure trans people are getting the same quality of care as everybody else.' Are cis women and trans women being treated equally? Priya speculated: 'The other question I wondered about was if pharmacies 'prioritise' people within the pharmacy.' However, Guerrini cast doubt on the claim that trans people were not being treated fairly when it comes to pharmaceutical access, saying: 'If this was true, it would be very sad to hear. 'To my knowledge however, this is not the case, we have definitely not been instructed to treat prescriptions differently. I am not aware of any prescribing guidelines that suggest this.' fae claimed that the government has shown more interest in the struggle cis women are facing, but has not not acknowledged how trans women are coping. She said: 'It certainly gives the impression that they are valuing one category of woman over another,' adding that it feels like Downing Street is 'culture-warring it'. Jamie has also seen trans women blamed for the HRT shortage online, which she said is incredibly frustrating.  'Simply looking at the numbers it doesn't make sense. Most trans people don't even get their HRT through UK clinics, rather from overseas to avoid complications with prescription fills, and even fewer use gel (many use oral, patch or injection),' she said. 'Trans people had already been seeing price hikes overseas for the gel forecasting the shortage, but it's evident the main cause of it is a combined increase in awareness for cis women taking HRT for menopause (very good thing!), and the medical industry being extremely slow to react.'  Trans people have already faced significant challenges this year, after being excluded from the government's conversion therapy ban. And fae believes the government is 'trying to set two classes of people against one another'. 'Both cis women and trans women need them [HRT meds]. It's very clear. The government needs to sort out supplies for both groups and do so pretty quickly,' she said.  Gendered Intelligence echoed this sentiment. 'Reproductive healthcare is all too often overlooked, with estradiol in particular suffering from frequent production shortages,' the charity said.  'Attacks on trans healthcare around the world have contributed to HRT scarcity, while in the UK post-Brexit supply chain issues have worsened existing shortages.' Trans men are impacted by HRT shortages too  During our research we heard from several other trans women who've been impacted by the shortages, but asked not to be directly quoted in the article.  We also heard from Ashley Wood, a 23-year-old trans man from Aberdeenshire, who said trans men are being impacted by testosterone HRT shortages, but this isn't being talked about.  Ashley has had issues accessing Testavan, a form of testosterone gel, until very recently. In early April he put in a request for his usual prescription but when it arrived a few weeks later, the pharmacist had ordered an alternative medication - prostap injections - instead. This left him without 'adequate testosterone for two weeks', he said.  He immediately reordered Testavan via his online pharmacy portal, but the prescription did not arrive. When he visited the pharmacy again in person, they admitted their supplier was out of stock.  'I was very lucky that they found one box of Testavan for me, however it is out of stock with the supplier right now and I am afraid that I am not going to be able to get a hold of it again,' he said. 'I have never had this issue before. 'In emotional terms it has made me feel uneasy, because even days off hormones and things can begin to revert back, and my testosterone relieves the majority of my gender dysphoria, so without it, it puts me in a very dark place and renders me unable to cope.' What has the government said? A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson told HuffPost UK: 'We recognise the importance of meeting the specific healthcare needs of transgender people and it is a cornerstone of the NHS that it provides services to those who need them with no discrimination. 'Some transgender people who use HRT may be affected by the current supply issues and we understand how distressing this can be. However, most HRT products - including alternatives to those experiencing supply issues - are available. 'Anyone who is worried about access to HRT or is unable to access HRT should speak to their GP or pharmacist.' We shared concerns with the Royal College of GPs that trans people were not the priority for HRT access. In response, Professor Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: 'GPs work hard to ensure all patients receive the treatment that they need when they need it. In instances where their medications are not available, for whatever reason, GPs will work, often with pharmacist colleagues, to see if an alternative treatment can be prescribed until shortages are resolved. 'The College is concerned to see supply issues around the provision of some preparations of HRT, and we understand the distress this is causing to many patients. As such we have continued to call for this issue to be resolved as quickly as possible, to ensure we're able to deliver the most appropriate care to our patients. 'While we appreciate the seriousness of the current situation and the frustrations patients are experiencing, we urge them not to share HRT medication as this could lead to serious side-effects.' * jane fae chooses to spell her name in lower case, Jamie chose to omit her surname from publication, and Priya is a pseudonym provided to offer anonymity.

The show has faced criticism from viewers after it was discovered that many of the 60 competitors who have taken to the stage have a professional profile or have already appeared on other talent shows, including international versions of BGT. This included Japanese magician Keiichi Iwasaki, who impressed hosts Ant and Dec so much on this year's series that they awarded him their Golden Buzzer, fast-tracking him to the semi-finals. It subsequently came to light that he had previously auditioned for Bulgaria, Spain and Germany's equivalent talent shows, and even made it to the semi-finals of Italia's Got Talent in 2016 with one of the tricks showcased in his BGT audition. BGT bosses were previously forced to defend another of this year's Golden Buzzer acts, Loren Allred, whose voice was featured in the hit film The Greatest Showman. Responding to the latest criticism, an ITV spokesperson told The Sun: 'All acts enter the competition with the hope of elevating their career to the highest level and help to reach massive new audiences which Britain's Got Talent brings in. 'As we're all aware, the pandemic affected so many lives, particularly those that work in the entertainment industry, and it is wrong to deny these people the opportunity to showcase their talents and entertain the nation, and ultimately perform in front of royalty at the Royal Variety Performance. 'As has always been the case, Britain's Got Talent is open to everyone.'  Earlier this month, Britain's Got Talent star Jonathan Goodwin made his first television appearance since he was left paralysed after a stunt went horrifically wrong during rehearsals for a spin-off of America's Got Talent. The stunt for AGT: Extreme was supposed to see the escapologist free himself and fall underneath two cars before they collided, but the vehicles were released too early and he fell 30ft to the ground, missing the safety airbag below.  Appearing on Lorraine alongside his fiancee, Sherlock star Amanda Abbington, Jonathan opened up about the accident, which has left him in a wheelchair. 'I'm not down about it. I'm doing as well as I can be,' Jonathan said. 'It was pretty gnarly. It sounds very dramatic sitting here but I nearly died... I saved my life because I fell upside down, head first to the ground but I didn't hit my head.'

I grew up, for the most part, without social media and the pressures of having to look perfect all the time. Prior to the days of Instagram, I was the queen of rewearing clothes, to the point where my mum actually referred to some of my outfits as 'uniforms'. In secondary school I was a big fan of thrifting and going to charity shops. It felt exhilarating finding clothes that weren't on the high street so I could cultivate my own sense of style. My look was pretty vintage-inspired - centring around a classic pair of Levi's that stuck with me for years. There were also lots of knit jumpers, silk skirts and graphic tees. The high street wasn't totally off limits - my number one item of this period was an orange ribbed dress from Primark. I wore this dress to the point of no return. It fit me like a glove and I managed to style it differently every time I wore it. Then I went to university and fell down a whole new fashion hole. It was 2014, when Instagram and influencers were on the come-up. I'd joined the platform in 2012 when I was just about to start sixth form, way before the days of fashion drops and influencer collaboration deals. But time - and fashion - moves quickly. By uni, most of my style choices were guided by what I saw online.  Back then, sustainability wasn't as foregrounded as it is today. And as a university student with limited income, fast fashion became my best friend. As the resident 'out-out' girl, I was mostly buying dresses, heels and party tops. I was a regular on sites like Pretty Little Thing and Missguided, and the high turnover proved perfect, because I didn't want to be seen in the same outfit twice. It also helped that the clothes were so cheap. I bought new and often.  It was thrilling, addictive even, but there was a downside: I began losing my personal style. In fact, choosing outfits started giving me real anxiety - I found myself wanting to look like the girls on the gram and to wear what they wore. And it wasn't a phase - after uni I remained in bondage with fast fashion. I was growing a small following online and wanted to keep up appearances with my peers. At the same time, I was on an intern's salary so money was limited. It was 2020 when I first picked up Lauren Bravo's book, How To Break Up With Fast Fashion. In it, Bravo looks at how fast fashion has made us shop impulsively, encouraging us to amass heaps of clothes we never actually wear - and the damage this is doing to the environment. She is after solutions, too, and so speaks to a range of fashion voices about how we might shop differently. 'Go back to your own wardrobe and think, 'Have I got something like this already? Do I need it? 'Is it going to make me happier? What can I style it with?' Can I wear it with five other things that are in my wardrobe?'' Sophia Slater, sustainability and fashion ethics expert, advises Bravo in the book. Once I'd read these words, I looked at my own wardrobe in a different way. Firstly, I realised my anxiety around choosing outfits wasn't about not having enough clothes in my closet - it was down to me losing that sense of personal style. I couldn't work out what I, Habiba, wanted to wear because I was too consumed with what everyone else was wearing.  Secondly, I saw that my outfits were all over the place. I didn't really own any wardrobe staples (white tops, jeans, blazers). Instead I fed into micro-trends - meaning I bought clothes that were only 'in' for short periods of time. Take the House Of Sunny Hockney Dress. For a hot minute, this style was everywhere, with fast fashion brands feverishly copying the brand's design. Then, after a few months, people stopped wearing them. I'll admit to buying a dress similar to that original one. I haven't worn it since last summer. It was 2021 when I decided to start being more intentional with my shopping and try following the near-mythical advice of a hundred fashion editors and sustainability experts: to build a capsule wardrobe. Though I knew this approach to my clothes would be better for the planet, if I'm being honest, my reasonings were more about me than the environment. I was excited to see if - and how - I could rediscover my own sense of style. I wanted to be able to look in the closet and not feel impending doom about my outfit choices. And doing a huge clear out felt like a relief. It was great to get rid of so many clothes I wasn't wearing. It was also shocking how many items I owned. I told myself: focus on buying the clothes you need, rather than want. So what did I need? According to Lena Krau and Lisa Wohlfarth from Everless Wardrobe, the right capsule wardrobe contains fewer garments, but should actually offer you more choice. 'It is colour-coordinated, timeless and offers as many possible combinations as possible. And the most important thing is that it fits you, your personal needs and your individual everyday life,' they told me. This sounded positive - and Krau and Wohlfarth also emphasise how much time, energy, money you save, all while reducing your ecological footprint.  I went to Tik Tok to find inspiration on how to build my capsule. The people I followed advised buying staple pieces such as plain tops, jeans, trousers, blazers and bodysuits. Essentially, things you can wear every day and style up or down with different clothing and accessories, depending on the occasion. Starting out with this new approach to fashion has been both overwhelming and underwhelming at the same time. Cost wise, I've tried to buy staples I know will last but are still affordable - so I've shopped at places like H&M, Zara and ASOS. Additionally, I've also bought from smaller more sustainable brands like Sio Studios. While on the pricier side, Sio's mesh top and skirt have already had plenty of outings. There have been high-street wins, too. I bought a particular white top from Zara a few months ago I now wear everywhere. It goes with everything, it's cool and easy to style with a pair of jeans or a ribbed skirt (ribs - still a classic!). Even though I've worn it on repeat, it feels good to know I'm getting cost per wear. It's like Krau and Wohlfarth say about capsule building: 'The number of bad and frustrating purchases decrease, because you value your favourite pieces much more and are generally much happier with your wardrobe. You're no longer constantly on the lookout for that new happy feeling.' After a few months, though, I couldn't ignore that my closet was getting blander. All I was buying were plain tops and trousers. Nothing really stood out. And when it came to planning outfits, instead of mixing and matching to find new combinations, I was reverting to wearing the same outfit again and again. I knew buying less might mean this, but why can't I enjoy repeating items and outfits, even if I look and feel good in them? It worked for me as a teenager. Social media comes into play here, of course. Most of the people I follow on Instagram wouldn't be caught dead wearing an outfit twice (at least not on their grid). And this makes me feel like I should follow suit - only not the same suit! - and keep things fresh and new. I need to remember the goal (and reward) in all this: reclaiming my personal style. I love the fact I have a favourite top again. And I'm still allowed to love shopping. 'Once you've established the basics in your closet, it's now a matter of identifying missing pieces of clothing,' Krau and Wohlfarth advise me. 'By writing a targeted wish list, you can achieve conscious-shopping behaviour.' Be alive and alert to possibilities, they suggest. 'Analysing is all about looking for inspiration, discovering your own style, creating your personal colour concept, and using outfit formulas to develop outfit combinations that work.' My lack of new clothes has certainly forced me to be more creative. Now I actively go into my wardrobe to see which top goes with a specific skirt or how I can re-style the dress I wore a few weeks ago, rather than go online to buy a new one for a specific occasion. Again and again, Instagram has made me want to quit my new path and give into impulse buying. But when I feel that instinct to spend, I try to look at all the clothes I already own and think how I can style them up. Doing this reminds me I have more than enough.  When I used to go shopping with my mum, before I bought any new item, she would ask me how I'd be able to wear it with clothes I had back home. She recognised the importance of building a wardrobe rather than an outfit. I try to ask myself the same question now before purchasing something new.  And as time goes on, I'm feeling like my old teenage self, someone who cares less about what other people think of me and more how I can express myself through my clothes. I want to build a wardrobe that's not only timeless but represents who I am. Releasing myself from the bondages of fast fashion isn't easy, but I hope future Habiba - and the planet - will thank me.", "eff9ac26690e3ecf8d4c73491a77d62d979398f024f921524f461db7": "Ricky Gervais cracked up Late Night host Seth Meyers and himself during a riff on full-body transplants.

Once seen as Boris Johnson's heir apparent, the chancellor saw his popularity nosedive recently over an underwhelming Spring Statement and revelations about his wife's tax affairs. HuffPost UK has learned that Sunak has been meeting with groups of Conservative backbenchers to get their views on how he should tackle the cost of living crisis, and they have not been holding back. 'He's not the golden boy any more,' said an MP who attended one of those gatherings last Monday night. 'There were around 30 of us and we gave him a hard time.' Sunak's answers to their forceful questions failed to assuage their anger. 'He came across as making excuses for the state of the economy,' one former cabinet minister told HuffPost UK. 'The most wounding criticism was that it isn't clear what the government's economic policy is. 'Some people brought up the fact that at least David Cameron and George Osborne had their 'long-term economic plan' and it was consistent. If tough decisions had to be made, they were made in that context. 'What is this government's economic policy? No one has any idea.' This uncertainty is typified by the chancellor's will-he-won't-he approach to a windfall tax on the enormous profits currently being enjoyed by oil and gas companies. Thanks to the global spike in energy prices, the likes of BP and Shell have posted astronomical earnings, leading to Labour and the Lib Dems calling for a one-off levy, with the money raised going towards cutting household bills. The government's response has been to criticise a windfall tax in principle, while being careful not to rule out bringing one in. This led to Tory MPs being forced to vote en masse against a windfall tax earlier this week, fully aware that the government may well end up backing the policy within days. The confusion at the heart of government has even led to reports that two of the prime minister's key advisers are making clear their opposition to a windfall tax at the same time as the Treasury appears to be laying the groundwork for one. 'We are all exploring every option available to grow the economy and ease the cost of living,' a senior Number 10 source told HuffPost UK. 'It's not the case of one lot advocating and another blocking. 'It's just good government - testing the arguments, exploring the merits, getting the detail right and setting the bar high for doing something no Conservative instinctively wants to do.' One former Conservative frontbencher said he had some sympathy for the chancellor.  'The problem for Rishi is that Tory MPs are all over the place on what they want done,' he said. 'There's not a consensus other than something needs to be done, and that makes his position very difficult. 'There are people who want a windfall tax and there are people that don't want a windfall tax. Others want to see benefits uprated and others who want tax cuts.' Asked what he thought Sunak would opt for, the MP said: 'There's going to be a windfall tax, that seems clear. But in the usual way, Tory MPs were marched up the hill to vote against it.' Another Conservative MP said he would reluctantly support a windfall tax, given the extent of the crisis facing household budgets. He said: 'The current situation doesn't feel sustainable. The oil and gas companies are making enormous profits out of events that are completely out of their control. How can we be the only people defending them? 'If you look at what happened in the 90s, Labour went into the 1997 election promising to bring in a windfall tax and they won a landslide. If we do it, we instantly shoot Labour's fox. 'You obviously can't keep doing windfall taxes because they really do deter investment and harm business confidence, but there is a case for one now. 'If you look at our economic prospects, October looks horrific when the energy price cap goes up, and PS150 council tax rebates just aren't going to touch the sides. 'Government can't solve every problem, but this is about protecting people from the worst of the cost of living crisis. I really think a windfall tax is going to happen.' Another ex-minister said: 'My sense from my conversations with colleagues is that while in principal they are against a windfall tax for exceptionally good reasons, the current circumstances, in which the energy companies are making massive profits, means the chancellor will probably go for one. He's getting strong briefing that we should have one from the Treasury.' But the MP warned the chancellor that the parliamentary party wants to see the tax burden - which is now the highest it's been for 70 years - fall as quickly as possible. 'Tory MPs are getting fed up of being a high spend, big state party,' he said. 'The definite sense of MPs and donors is that people are sick to death of not being a Conservative Party.' On Wednesday night, Sunak told business leaders that he would use his next Budget in the autumn to cut their taxes, but he was silent on what immediate help he will provide for voters seeing their energy and food bills soaring. The Treasury points to the PS9bn-worth of support the chancellor announced in February to bring down council tax and fuel costs, while insisting that further support will come in October when the energy price cap is set to rise significantly once again.  But with two key by-elections coming in June, and Labour maintaining a consistent lead in the polls, Tory MPs are demanding action long before then. The big question now is what form that will take. A Labour source said: 'The cost of living crisis has drawn back the tide on an out of touch, dilettante chancellor. 'But Rishi Sunak is really just a symptom of the wider Tory malaise. This is a government out of ideas and rapidly running out of road - and after a decade of failing to grow the economy, all they've got left to offer is tax rise after tax rise on working people.'", "be05dc73cda16f1af3b63b4a02dd9012dd30a71446e5e98f0257abb8": "We hope you love the products we recommend!

Facetheory is committed to developing straightforward products that are as effective as they are affordable. We're also quite drawn to the chic, minimalist packaging. Their products are great for anyone who wants to upgrade their beauty routine and get real results (without the high costs). I've tried a few of their products and was surprised to find that despite high levels of well-sourced active ingredients, they're priced significantly lower than many of the brands I use. Like The Ordinary, Facetheory's formulas are vegan and cruelty-free, and the brand also prioritises sustainability. Most of their products are available in amber glass jars with aluminum caps or 100% aluminum tubes that are easy to recycle.

Purves panicked when she read in a tweet that Depp's legal team had brought in a forensic psychologist who claimed that Heard had borderline personality disorder, or BPD. 'I was like, 'Oh, no.' I know what many people think of Heard, and BPD is already a very misunderstood and highly stigmatised condition,' Purves, tells HuffPost. 'I knew the combination would result in BPD and abuse being linked, since this is the first time a lot of people have heard about BPD.' We've made some progress, on a societal level, toward recognising and normalising certain mental health issues, but stigma and misunderstanding around many diagnoses still exist. Most people, for example, have a fairly decent understanding of what anxiety and depression entail. Unfortunately, that isn't the case for BPD - and it can lead people to assume the worst.  BPD is a mental disorder that affects how a person feels and sees themselves in the world, says Ziv Cohen, the founder and medical director of Principium Psychiatry and a forensic and clinical psychiatrist. (Cohen, like the other mental health professionals interviewed in this story, has not treated Heard.)  If you have borderline personality disorder, you tend to see the world in extremes, such as all good or all bad. 'This can create chaos in personal relationships, as the intimate partner of the person with BPD oscillates from being 'good' to 'bad,' from 'savior' to 'hater,'' Cohen tells HuffPost. People with BPD usually experience fears of abandonment in their relationships, and worry about others abandoning them even with no objective evidence to support it. (That heightened fear of rejection is often tied to past trauma in childhood.) This kind of frantic, impulsive behaviour tends to push others away and lead to fractured relationships, Cohen said. 'Generally, people with BPD have chronic feelings of emptiness, tend to be impulsive, and are at risk for other conditions like mood disorders,' he added. People who live with BPD also have a hard time regulating their emotions - it's been said that living with BPD is like existing with no 'emotional skin.' One potentially positive aspect is that those intense emotions often translate into great creativity and empathy, according to Lauren Kerwin, a psychologist who specialises in depression, anxiety, trauma and BPD. 'Several studies have shown that those with BPD have an enhanced ability to be perceptive and read others' emotions,' she says.  Still, it's the negative side of BPD that gets the most attention on social media. You don't have to poke around Twitter very long to find tweets characterizing Heard and others with BPD as 'toxic,' 'manipulative' or 'abusive.' One YouTube video goes as far as suggesting that because Heard allegedly has BPD, she's 'not even fit to be a mum.' (The 'Aquaman' actor, who finalised her divorce from Depp in 2017, announced the birth of her daughter last year.) Purves and others with the condition say it's disheartening to see BPD equated with violent behaviour. 'I definitely worry that 'BPD' will become a phrase that is used to describe violent people, because it's just not true,' she tells HuffPost - especially since violence associated with BPD is far more likely to occur in the form of self-harm, not violence against other people. People with BPD expect to be further stigmatized now Madi Faith, a 34-year-old from Dorset was so taken aback by the intensity of social media posts about Heard and her alleged diagnosis, she decided to tweet about it. (Faith was previously diagnosed with BPD, although she said she no longer fits enough of the criteria to warrant a diagnosis.) 'Reminder,' she wrote on Twitter. 'Amber Heard won't see your posts villainising people who are diagnosed with borderline personality disorder as abusive, manipulative, violent, attention-seeking, toxic monsters - yet your friends with BPD will.' 'Listening to the testimony, there was this implication that people with BPD are incredibly manipulative and violent toward their partner and that they use the legal system to their advantage,' Faith tells HuffPost. 'That they'll claim abuse and file restraining orders to make themselves appear to be the victim.' 'I think that was the point,' she said. 'To create a link between mental health and dangerous behaviour, which is such a damaging connection to be reinforcing, when it's actually people suffering from mental illness that are far more vulnerable to violence, not violent themselves.' Jenni Elyse, 44, wasn't surprised to read the callous takes on social media. People with BPD tend to get a bad rap online and in pop culture; when TV shows and movies have a 'crazy' female character, a BPD diagnosis is often involved. Sometimes, even friends who should know better make casual, cutting comments about the disorder. Before her diagnosis in 2020, Jenni Elyse says that's what happened with a friend who's a licensed clinical social worker. (Jenni Elyse asked to use her first and middle names only to protect her privacy.) 'I told my friend that my psychiatrist was trying to decide if he wanted to diagnose me with dependent personality disorder or BPD. In response, she told me, 'You don't have borderline personality disorder. If you did, we wouldn't be friends,'' Jenni Elyse tells HuffPost. 'That was the first time I realised how much stigma, even by professionals, there is surrounding BPD.' Jenni Elyse is concerned about the stigma getting worse in light of the Depp-Heard defamation trial, but she hopes to use the conversation to help more people understand what the condition is actually like. Last week, she posted a Twitter thread describing how BPD plays out in her life, and how it's manageable with the right care. 'I'll continue to post because like my therapist said, the way to break the stigma is to help everyone understand what it's really like and how to treat it,' she tells HuffPost.  How to manage your feelings if you have BPD and are unsettled by the trial If you've been diagnosed with BPD (or suspect that you may have the disorder), be especially gentle with yourself while the Heard-Depp trial is ongoing. Therapists we spoke to suggested the following ways to cope: Remind yourself that this trial is not about you If you start to get fixated on what's happening, remember: This is a defamation trial involving messy fallout from a divorce case that you ultimately have nothing to do with. 'I'd suggest to anyone who was upset by news about Heard and BPD to remember that in a divorce situation or a lawsuit, each side may make all kinds of accusations against the other,' Cohen says. 'This can be a helpful moment for individuals with BPD to reframe their thinking if they are feeling personally targeted. This case is really about Heard and Depp's relationship, not BPD.' Take a breather from social media, or curate your feed so the trial isn't everywhere you look Yes, clips from the Heard-Depp trial are seemingly everywhere online right now, but there are ways to check out.  If your YouTube feed is wall-to-wall coverage of the trial because you watched a clip or two and now the algorithm thinks you're interested, remove individual videos from your watch history. That may reduce the chances of similar recommendations in the future. (It also might help to remove individual searches from your search history.) On Twitter, you can mute phrases and names you don't want to see on your feed. The Verge has a helpful guide on how to do that on your iPhone or Android. You can similarly block specific videos and keep your feed customised on TikTok by following these steps. Or take a break from social media entirely 'If that's what you need, give yourself permission to take that space,' says Saba Harouni Lurie, a therapist and owner of Take Root Therapy in Los Angeles. 'Maybe instead connect with safe people, those who know you and love you. Allow those relationships to help anchor you.' Remember: People with BPD are not broken Debbie DeMarco Bennett is a certified life coach and writer who's blogged about her journey through BPD and into recovery. While she's not personally bothered by the Heard-Depp case or the misguided posts she sees on social media, she understands why others are upset. 'I actually reached out to a YouTuber and asked him to reconsider his thumbnail for his video, which read 'Amber Heard diagnosed as CRAZY' in a big font,' she tells HuffPost. DeMarco Bennett says the majority of the people she's worked with in the past decade are 'intelligent, super-sensitive, highly capable individuals with incredible potential.' People with BPD are not 'broken,' she says - they just have what psychologist Marsha Linehan calls a 'skills deficit.' (Linehan is the creator of dialectical behaviour therapy, a type of therapy that can be very effective for reducing or managing symptoms of BPD. Some even call it the 'gold standard' of BPD treatment.) 'People with BPD are not crazy. They just never learned the skills needed to effectively feel, process and manage their emotions, which they often experience more intensely than other people,' DeMarco Bennett says. 'If you're bothered by this trial, remind yourself of that.' Consider talking to a mental health professional   'It's important that people with BPD have access to compassionate care to learn how to regulate and manage intense emotions when they come up,' DeMarco Bennett says.    Of course, therapy can be pricey, even if you have insurance. This article lists a few suggestions for cutting costs, even just a bit.  Ultimately, though, it's worth seeking out that help. 'There's hope, there's treatment, there's a way to build a life worth living for those of us with BPD,' Jenni Elyse says.  'There's a quote from the founder of DBT that goes, 'Life can be worth living even when there is pain,'' she says. 'A year ago, after I was diagnosed with BPD, I didn't think that was possible, but therapy has changed the way I think and how I react to the world. It has literally saved my life.'

But if you're wondering what it took to bring the LGBTQ+ coming-of-age drama to our screens, we've done some digging to find out the secrets from behind the scenes... 1. Creator Alice Oseman said casting the show was a 'really stressful process'  Because she wanted to ensure the show was cast authentically to celebrate 'all kinds of different queer experiences', getting the right people to play Charlie, Nick and the other characters took its time.  'We wanted a trans actor to play Elle, we wanted the actors to be around the right age and obviously, there needs to be talented actors as well,' she told the PA news agency.  'So there were a lot of different factors, which made it a really stressful process, particularly trying to find authentic actors. 'If we didn't find the people we knew the show just wouldn't work. But we were determined to do it anyway. And we were lucky. We found the perfect people.' 2. Joe Locke had never acted professionally before Heartstopper Joe was cast as Charlie in the show after responding to an open casting call, to which 10,000 auditioned.  'You didn't need an agent, you just sent in a self-tape,' he told This Morning. 'I ended up getting the part and it was just all my dreams come true.' 3. However, he had no-one to celebrate his huge career news with due to Covid He explained: 'I was on my own in my house on the Isle of Man and it was during Covid last year. So I had to fly to London for an audition and then fly home and isolate on my own for two weeks in my house. 'So I was on my own and my agent phoned me and told me I'd got the job and it was just me and my dog in the house. I screamed very loudly.' 4. Kit Connor originally tried out for the role of Charlie While Kit said he knew he didn't fit Charlie's physical description, he wanted to go for the role because he loved it so much.  He told Radio Times: 'The audition tape they sent through was one of Charlie's speeches where he's really just at his most genuine, most stripped back point and it's really beautifully written, and I thought, 'I really want to do this.' 'I thought, 'There's no chance I'm going to get it,' because physically there's nothing about me that could fit this character. But then luckily there was Nick that I could sort of slot into quite well.' 5. Kit's casting as Nick initially caused some confusion among the make-up team Speaking to Still Watching Netflix, Kit explained: 'I've always had a baby face, a really bad baby face. When we got cast, they had my picture from when I was about 14/15 in the make-up room. Apparently, the whole make-up team was like, 'I don't think you cast the right person? He's really young.'' 6. Stonewall were brought on board to support cast and crew  Netflix brought LGBTQ+ rights charity Stonewall on board to help advise and educate everyone involved in the project on topics such as queer history and pronouns, Yasmin Finney, who plays Elle, told Elle magazine.  'I already knew Heartstopper would be queer positive and celebrate chosen family, but I was so grateful of Stonewall's involvement,' she added.  Jeffrey Ingold, the show's LGBTQ+ consultant, said in a behind-the-scenes video interview for Netflix: 'We can help give a more authentic view of the context in which the show is happening, so it doesn't feel like a drama that is happening over here, it is based in the reality of what kids are going through.  'We did a lot of conversation and training around what is happening in schools these days, so particularly for the cast, they could take that into the roles, and for the crew, they could also understand why this show matters and what it's going to mean to the audience who watch it.' Executive producer Patrick Walters added that Stonewall helped read through scripts and trained everyone on appropriate language and how to cultivate a safe space.  7. The director wanted as many people behind the cameras to be from the LGBTQ+ community too In a behind-the-scenes video interview for Netflix, director Euros Lyn said: 'You tell a story as a director, you are not by yourself, you're really on a huge team of designers, photographers, make-up, hair - loads of people. And I wanted as many of those people as possible to be from the LGBTQ+ communities, so they could bring their experiences and identify the bits of the story that can only be from an LGBTQ perspective.' 8. The show is 'a little bit different' to the comic 'I like to think of it in that the TV show is an expanded version of the comic,' Alice Oseman told Netflix in a video interview.  'The core story of the comic is very much in the show, we haven't changed what is in the comic, we've just made the story bigger and we've made the world wider. Beyond Nick and Charlie's story, we learn a lot more about Tao and Elle, Tara and Darcey and there are also new characters as well.' She continued: 'The thing I've learned about adaptations is that something that works for one thing like a comic might not work for a TV show. So when developing Heartstopper as a TV show, we had to look at it from a TV perspective and how do we take this story and make it work on screen.' 9. Alice only tried to get Olivia Colman on a punt and was 'shocked' when she said yes Talking about casting the Oscar-winner as Nick's mum, she told the PA news agency: 'I was shocked. When we were discussing trying to get a big name to be Nick's mum, I was literally like, there's no way this is going to happen. 'This is the silliest idea ever and there's literally not any point doing this. But we tried anyway and Olivia wanted to do it, and I just couldn't believe it. 'There's really no other way to say it, I was just shocked but so, so happy, because she's such an incredible actress, she brings so much to that character, and all the scenes with Nick's mum just feel so special and subtle and just really beautiful performance.' 10. Olivia shot all her scenes in just two days 'She seemed to really enjoy it,' Alice told PA. 'She was only on set for two days and to be honest, I didn't really get to talk to her very much because we're on set and it's very intense. 'But I feel like she really loved the story and she really connected with Kit, who plays Nick, and just really enjoyed working with him.' 11. Olivia cried for real during filming of the show's most emotional scene While reading through the touching moment in which Nick comes out to his mother as bisexual, Olivia became tearful for real, which initially proved to be a bit of a worry for Kit.  He told This Morning:   'Normally before every scene we read it through about 50%, you don't go 100% of the way. We were reading it through and suddenly Olivia just started crying. 'At first, I was thinking, 'God, she's just really good, I need to step up my game massively here,' so I was really worried at that point. I think then other people told me afterwards that it was because it's such a beautifully written scene and a crucial part in so many people's lives. I think it really touched her. 'I was just scared to be honest,' he joked, describing her as 'the most absolutely lovely person in the world'. 12. Joe missed out on seeing Les Miserables so he could meet Olivia  As Joe did not share any scenes with Olivia on the show, he was keen to meet the star, and gave up tickets to the West End production of Les Miserables so he could travel back to set on his day off and meet her.  Kit explained to Still Watching Netflix: 'I had two days filming with Olivia. It was originally meant to be Olivia and I filming for two days, and on the second day, I think Joe was like, 'I would like to meet her, obviously', so they ended up scheduling some time...' 'That's not what happened!' Joe contested. 'I wasn't supposed to meet her and then I got a call on the second day saying that we might have to do some pick-ups and reshoots of just before the rain scene in the hallway, so you'll get to meet Olivia.' So I was like, if that gets to happen, amazing. And then they called me at like 3pm, asking if I could come in.' 13. She is not the only A-lister in the show, however Stephen Fry also has an unexpected role in the show - not that you will have seen him.  The actor lends his voice to the character of Headmaster Barnes, who runs Truham Grammar School where Nick and Charlie go, and can be heard commentating over the tannoy on the school sports day.  14. Joe had an embarrassing moment filming Charlie's running scenes He told Attitude magazine: 'I had to ask the extras to slow down because I was supposed to be this incredible runner and every take, they were just slowly getting closer to me. I was like, 'Can you guys just like slow down a bit?', which was very embarrassing.' 15. Joe's coffee breath was a known thing on set Kit revealed he would often make light of Joe's love of coffee after filming a kissing scene.  'He had this joke that my breath always smelt of coffee,' Joe told Still Watching Netflix.  'Joe loves coffee and there was this one time where we had to do a practice kiss for a scene and Joe had just had a full cup of coffee and I was just like, this is not nice,' Kit recalled.  'I felt that I was a victim in that situation,' he joked.  16. Kit had a rugby coach to help him perfect Nick's sporting prowess Kit had only played rugby as a young child before being cast as star rugby player Nick.  Speaking to Still Watching Netflix, Kit explained that he worked on his game with a coach before and during filming to help him improve.  17. Joe was less keen on training, however Joe did go along with Kit for one rugby training session, but 'not any more after that'.  'I think he quickly decided that wasn't for him,' Kit said.  'I didn't own any sports clothes, so I arrived in loose jeans... It wasn't rugby,' Joe said.  'I made the executive decision that Charlie wasn't supposed to be good at rugby, therefore I was allowed to be bad.'  18. Harry's birthday party had to be shot during the day In the episode where school bully Harry throws a birthday party, scenes were shot at Hampton Court House, a school in East Molesey. However, while the party was set at night, it had to be filmed during the day, which the crew had to work around.  Cinematographer Diana Olifirova told IBC: 'I loved the windows and had planned to shoot a moonlight effect through them. But we didn't have access to the location at night. That meant we had to black out the windows, but we lit it to appear as if there were some light outside.  'The biggest challenge in a room full of people was having the camera pick out our main characters. This involved a little planning about where the camera would be so that the actors would hit a mark and we'd have a pre-set light trained on them.' 19. The animations honour Alice Oseman's original graphic novels  If you didn't know that Heartstopper was based on graphic novels of the same name, you probably would have wondered where all the animated moments in the show came from.  All the leaves, lightening bolts and other little animated details all honour Alice Oseman's original text, which executive producer Patrick Walters told Pink News became known as 'Heartstopper moments' to the crew.  'Hopefully it gives you goosebumps and makes you lean in when those moments happen,' he said. 20. Alice has a cameo in the final episode The writer and creator made a blink-and-you'll miss it appearance in episode eight, seen as a passenger on the train that Charlie and Nick travel to the seaside on.  She revealed on Twitter that she was even drawing the comic versions of the characters from her graphic novels during the scene.  21. She had never been on a TV set prior to filming Heartstopper Alice said she 'honestly didn't know anything about TV making before' adapting Heartstopper. 'I have never been on a TV set before,' she said in a Netflix video interview.  However, she said she was on set 'every day' during the shoot, overseeing everything that was happening.  'I have learned so much about what everyone on set does, all the different roles that there are, and it really is a team effort,' she added.  22. There's a reason why the show doesn't touch on more adult themes  Executive producer Patrick Walters told Pink News  : 'We decided we wanted the show to speak to as many different ages as possible, so we were deliberate about not having too many swear words, too many overtly adult situations, because that stuff didn't fit the tone of the show anyway. But also in not having that, we were opening up the show for more people to see it.  'I really hope the younger generation, 11, 12, 13, will watch the show and get something out of it.' 23. Joe has already got an idea for the second series  He told GQ: 'In the next graphic novel, Charlie struggles with his mental health and I'd love to explore that more. 'I think a lot of mental health and eating disorder shows tackle mental health in a way that is hard-hitting and really dark, but I'd love to come at these issues from a lighter place.' 24. And he has a dream cameo so great that we need it to happen immediately  In an interview with Variety, Joe also shared his casting hopes for the next instalment. 'Jennifer Coolidge should play my grandmother,' he said. 'That would be so cool. I love her. She's amazing.' He added: 'I also want a scene with Nick's mum so I can work with Olivia Colman.' Heartstopper is available to stream on Netflix now. ", "82e7d81fe1c29a1fbd6db4d70f6c2182d3e73a43d4b098be9c51702c": "Boris Johnson met Sue Gray to discuss her crunch partygate report in what Labour has described as a 'secret meeting'. It is understood the pair held at least one meeting to give an update on the document's progress while it was being drafted but a Whitehall source said that its contents were not discussed at any point. Such meetings would not have been viewed as unusual, the source said, with the aim to take stock of what stage the report was at. Sky News, which broke the story, reported the meeting took place 'weeks ago'. It comes as around 30 people, including Johnson, are being contacted by the Cabinet Office to warn them of the contents of the document ahead of its publication.   Angela Rayner, Labour's deputy leader, called on the prime minister to 'urgently explain' why the meeting had taken place. She said public confidence in the process had already been 'depleted', and people 'deserve to know the truth'. Downing Street insisted that the prime minister had been 'clear throughout' that the report should be 'completely independent'. It is thought that most of the Cabinet Office letters were sent out on Thursday, as the Metropolitan Police concluded its investigation into lockdown breaches in Downing Street and across Whitehall. Johnson is set to be among those approached but No 10 had no update as to whether he had received a letter on Friday evening. Rayner said: 'Boris Johnson must urgently explain why he held a secret meeting with Sue Gray to discuss her report despite claiming her investigation was completely independent. 'Public confidence in the process is already depleted, and people deserve to know the truth. 'This is a prime minister incapable of taking responsibility for the rotten culture he has created in Downing Street or of doing the decent thing. 'The Sue Gray report must be published in full and with all accompanying evidence.' Adam Wagner, a human rights lawyer who has specialised in lockdown rule-breaking, said the document was 'not an independent report' and 'never has been'. 'It's an internal report. This isn't a judgment on Sue Gray, it's a statement of fact - she is an employee investigating her direct line managers,' he tweeted. A No 10 spokesperson said: 'The prime minister commissioned the investigation led by Sue Gray and has been clear throughout that it should be completely independent.   'As he reiterated again today, the decision on what and when to publish rests entirely with the investigation team and he will respond in Parliament once it concludes.' Not everyone contacted by the Cabinet Office will necessarily be named or identified by some other means in the report - it may merely be that their actions are referenced because they are pertinent to the narrative of a particular event. The investigators are understood not to be including the full details of the document's contents in the letters but instead are giving a 'gist' of the relevant sections to those being approached. Sources close to the inquiry expect the report will be published early next week. Johnson declined to apologise again for the rule-breaking in No 10 during a visit to Hilltop Honey's factory in Newtown in Powys, Wales, on Friday. Asked if Downing Street would be blocking any names from appearing in the report, he said: 'That will be entirely up to Sue Gray and I'll be looking forward very much to seeing what she has to say, and fingers crossed that will be pretty soon next week.'  ", "035574b402b90eb81fa3f26d64f1713320d1a14d1208b268ebefc68d": "Rishi Sunak has become the first frontline politician to be named in The Sunday Times Rich List since its inception in 1989 - just as the chancellor faces pressure to help ease the cost-of-living crisis facing households. On the week inflation hit a 40-year high, prompting further fears about the UK tipping into a recession, Sunak and wife Akshata Murty entered The Sunday Times Rich List for the first time with their joint PS730 million fortune. Their listing among the nation's 250 wealthiest people also comes after their finances came under intense scrutiny when it emerged Murty holds non-domiciled status allowing her to reduce her UK tax bill. The timing could not have been worse for the ambitious politician, who earlier this week promised a tax cut for big business but conspicuously only said he was 'standing ready' to help families.  Sunak had been seen as a frontrunner in any leadership contest to replace Boris Johnson but his standing was severely dented by the scrutiny of his family's exorbitant wealth. The chancellor has been resisting calls to impose a windfall tax on the high profits of oil and gas giants to help fund measures to ease the crisis, as well as facing demands to cut taxes as part of a new support package.   On Friday morning, the Sunday Times Rich List revealed the couple featured at 222 in the list with the joint forecast of PS730 million, driven by Murty's PS690 million stake in Infosys.   It was estimated Murty's non-dom status could have saved her PS20 million in taxes on dividends from her shares in Infosys, an Indian IT company founded by her father. She later agreed to pay UK taxes on her worldwide income. Sunak was cleared of breaching the ministerial code by the prime minister's standards adviser after considering the tax affairs. Many on social media were quick to point out how further publicity of his wealth puts Sunak in a tricky spot. But deputy prime minister Dominic Raab praised Sunak on Times Radio. He said: 'Rishi Sunak is a fantastic example of someone who's been successful in business who's come in to make a big impact in public service. 'I think we want more of those people. 'I think it's fantastic that you've got someone of British Indian origin, showing all people in our country that you can get to the top of politics. 'And frankly, I think if I understood correctly, The Sunday Times Rich List was a reflection of not just him, but his wife. 'And to be honest with you, his wife is an incredibly successful entrepreneur in her own right.'", "658e0500cecec5c2c9c53cadc534e125576c44f988729263c8e1ae79": "If, like pretty much the rest of the globe, you've completely fallen for the charms of Heartstopper, then we bring you the news you've all been waiting for. Netflix has confirmed that the LGBTQ+ teen drama will be returning for not one, but two brand new series. The show, which is based on author and illustrator Alice Oseman's graphic novels, has retrained a 100% Critic rating on Rotten Tomatoes since the series debuted on the streaming service last month. The drama has also been a huge global success, reaching the Netflix Top Ten list in 54 countries. It has not only become one of the streaming service's most popular shows, but it's made overnight stars out of its mostly unknown cast, including the two leads, Kit Connor and Joe Locke, the latter of which had never acted before. Joe, who plays Charlie Spring, has already revealed what he wants to see in the second season. 'I'm excited for [Charlie and Nick],' Joe told British GQ. If we get another season (fingers crossed), I'm looking forward to seeing how they develop as a couple.' He continued: 'In the next graphic novel, Charlie struggles with his mental health and I'd love to explore that more. 'I think a lot of mental health and eating disorder shows tackle mental health in a way that is hard-hitting and really dark, but I'd love to come at these issues from a lighter place.' Meanwhile, in another interview with Variety, Joe also shared his casting hopes for the next instalment of Heartstopper. 'Jennifer Coolidge should play my grandmother,' he said. 'That would be so cool. I love her. She's amazing. 'I also want a scene with Nick's mum so I can work with Olivia Colman.'", "a09c25e704cc25434e5687dd2657258a893c3d31ed81189d5473d88e": "", "868f19efa5df1f5f6dea619b39f986e7f434d42480c10398d373f91e": "A fresh row has broken out after a government adviser suggested calls to criminalise street harassment  are being blocked. Nimco Ali, the independent adviser on tackling violence against women and girls, suggested the plan was facing 'pushback' from parts of government.  In an interview on the BBC's Political Thinking with Nick Robinson, Ali appeared to hint that the prime minister had not fully supported the proposal.   Ali, who was appointed by Home Secretary Priti Patel in 2020, is pushing for street harassment such as wolf-whistling and catcalling to be made a crime, with on-the-spot fines for offenders.     She said Patel was 'very much behind' the campaign but 'then you meet other people saying no'.   'It's been frustrating and it's been disappointing,' Ali said. When asked if the pushback had come from the prime minister's advisers, Ali replied that the source was 'a lot closer than that' but that people would be able to interpret 'my silence'. However, No.10 insisted that tackling violence against women was a top priority. Meanwhile, Ali and Robinson ended up in a Twitter spat after the interview was aired.  Ali, who is best friends with Boris Johnson's wife Carrie, tweeted about Robinson: 'I am [the] Home Secretary's independent advisor as I corrected you on the podcast and I did not blame him for this. 'Honestly I talked about almost dying from FGM and wanting a better world for girls and this is what you go with.' Robinson replied saying she was fascinating on her campaigns against FGM and violence against women and girls, but added: 'You also volunteered your frustration that a new law on street harassment which you and Priti Patel backed had been blocked. I asked who blocked it... 'I asked whether it was No.10 political advisers who blocked it. You said 'it's a lot closer than that'. 'I asked whether you meant the PM. You said 'you can take from my silence as you like'.' Last July the government announced a crackdown on sexual harassment, after a public consultation following the murder of Sarah Everard.  As part of the crackdown, the government said it would not rule out creating new laws over street harassment, saying: 'We are looking carefully at where there may be gaps in existing law and how a specific offence for public sexual harassment could address those.' At the time, Patel said: 'The safety of women and girls across the country, wherever they are, is an absolute priority for me. 'It is unacceptable that women and girls are still subject to harassment, abuse, and violence, and I do not accept that violence against women and girls is inevitable.' The government also said it would not rule out creating new laws over street harassment, saying: 'We are looking carefully at where there may be gaps in existing law and how a specific offence for public sexual harassment could address those.'  On Friday, Downing Street suggested it had not ruled out introducing a criminal offence of street harassment. A No.10 spokesman said: 'I would point to a tweet from Nimco this morning where she addresses that and says I did not blame him, referring to the prime minister.' Pressed whether an offence of street harassment is still being considered, he said: 'We will continue to look at where there may be gaps and how a specific offence could address those. 'I'm not going to get into specifics but as I say this remains a top priority for this government.' He said he was 'not aware' of any conversations between Ali and No.10 before she posted the tweet, but stressed that Ali said she did not blame the prime minister. Asked who then she was blaming, he said: 'I can't speculate or speak on her behalf.' ", "dc8152f4bc041635189bc8366e46620eb800b27162e5efe525b4d0d6": "Leaving one job for another takes a lot of steps. After you complete the hurdles of stressful job interviews, negotiating a job offer and setting up your transition, there's still one crucial step before you bid your old job farewell: deleting your files.  Often, employee handbooks dictate what you can and cannot delete, so you need to be both careful not to run afoul of those policies - and to delete everything you should.  'Employees need to be very wary not to accidentally or intentionally delete or copy any of an employer's proprietary material, such as emails, contacts, files, documents, software, and the like,' says Joanna Grama, associate vice president of Vantage Technology Consulting Group. 'If I had worked on a big project that I was proud of, and wanted to use a deliverable from that project in my work portfolio, I would ask my employer for a copy for that purpose, and also ask them to provide written permission that I can use the copy for certain purposes.' But once you've double-checked what you can delete or take with you, here are five things you should ideally be wiping from your work computer so that you can leave your job in peace.  1. Personal Files Like Photos And Tax Documents Ideally, you should not be using your work laptop for personal items, but as work and life boundaries blur, it's easy to forget. If you are planning an exit, you'll first want to get rid of any personal files like family photos. 'Generally speaking, if it is permitted in an employee handbook, employees should delete their personal files from a work computer/phone before they leave an employer,' Grama says. 'If I stored pictures of my kids on my work phone, I would want to move those files to my own personal storage and delete them from the work device.' If you downloaded sensitive documents to print at your office, like your W-2 or other tax papers, be sure to delete those, too. 'Highly recommend deleting personal files, tax documents, contacts and personal photos,' said Nick Santora, CEO of the security awareness training platform Curricula. 2. Your browser history Want to delete any embarrassing Google searches? Grama also recommended deleting your browser history and any passwords that your browser may have saved for you. For Chrome, select History, then 'clear browsing data,' and then select the appropriate time range. On Firefox, once you select History, you will have the option to 'clear recent history'. 3. Any personal apps, software or extensions you downloaded If you downloaded a bank app or Venmo on a work-issued phone, make sure to delete those before you leave. You should also think about similar items on your laptop.  'If I had downloaded applications, software, or browser extensions for my own use and not used for company purposes, I would probably delete that from the work device as well,' Grama advises. 'On my last day, I would also log out of any active applications that I use for work and I would empty the computer's recycle bin.' As part of your clean-up process, consider whether you need to update the email address you use to subscribe to any services or newsletters. 'If the newsletter is one that I still want to receive after I leave the employer and it is not a newsletter for my employer, then I will want to change the email address to a personal one,' Grama says. 'If the newsletter is one that I no longer want to receive, I could unsubscribe from it, just to keep my work email tidy for whomever might be monitoring it once I leave.' 4. Personal messaging apps and cookies Your employer can potentially have access to your personal messaging apps, like Apple Messages or Google Hangouts, if you leave them on your work computer, so be sure to take those off, too.  'A lot of people will log in to their personal accounts - think iMessage - on their work computer,' says Andrew Stanek, data science manager at Pave, a compensation startup. 'I always suggest logging out of these and clearing your cookies so they don't stay on the work computer.'  Web browsers also store cookies, which contain information about your website activity and preferences.  On Chrome, select Chrome from the top menu, then 'clear browsing data.' From there you will have the option to clear all your cookies. On Firefox, click Privacy & Security, then the 'cookies and site data' option. On Safari, choose 'clear history' from the Safari tab of the drop-down menu.  5. Passwords  If you've ever used your work computer for anything personal, you likely saved a password. Be sure to wipe those off before you leave.  'Most of the time work computers will also be used as personal devices on occasion. This means that your passwords and account for personal websites might also remain unless you intentionally delete them off the device,' Santora says. 'It's best to disconnect any type of iCloud or Google Sync to ensure none of your personal information is left behind to your former employer.'", "a38146b07b27429930cfa781f306afb18c3ba44f7afd056900577a2d": "Rylan Clark has dropped a not-so-subtle hint that reports a Big Brother revival is in the works at ITV is actually happening.    Last month, The Sun published an article claiming the hit reality show could be returning to our screens as soon as 2023, with a brand new home on ITV2.    Following new claims that ITV cop drama The Bill is also set for a comeback, Big Brother narrator Marcus Bentley tweeted on Friday: 'Wow a TV show that I was in is coming back to ITV!' This prompted Rylan to quote a famous meme of Davina McCall hosting Big Brother, replying to Marcus: 'Fancy another one?'   Marcus then replied with laughing face and shocked face emojis, adding: 'YES!!!!'  According to The Sun, the comeback season could potentially air on ITV2 in the autumn of next year, after that year's series of Love Island has ended.  An ITV spokesperson previously declined to comment when contacted by HuffPost UK Big Brother and its celebrity spin-off originally ran between 2000 and 2010 on Channel 4, with Davina at the helm. After Channel 4 decided not renew the show, it moved to Channel 5 in 2011, where Ultimate Big Brother winner Brian Dowling, and later Emma Willis, took over presenting duties until the show was cancelled in 2018. Reports have linked former Big Brother's Bit On The Side host Rylan - who won the Celebrity version of the show in 2013 - to the main presenting role on the possible revival.   In a recent interview with the Daily Star, Davina said she 'really hopes' to see Big Brother back on our screens.  She said: '[The prospect of] Big Brother returning is very exciting. I mean, I really, really hope it comes back, and I think if it's coming back to ITV2 then that is a really good home for it. 'I'd just be interested to see how they do casting and change it up at all. It would be good to kind of just get really interesting people in the house and maybe try a different mix. So yeah, very exciting.'

Scotland Yard has concluded its investigation into lockdown breaches and has issued 126 fines. The prime minister has been told by the police he will not receive more than the single fixed penalty notice already handed out, despite being believed to have been present at multiple rule-breaking events.  The end of the police inquiry means Gray, a senior civil servant tasked with undertaking an inquiry, can now publish her internal report, it is expected to be released on Tuesday or Wednesday. Speaking in Wales on Friday, Johnson said: 'I'm very grateful to the Met for their work, I'm thankful for everything they've done. 'We just need to wait for Sue Gray to report, fingers crossed, that will be very soon, and I'll be saying some more next week.' Asked if No. 10 would be blocking any names from appearing, he said: 'That will be entirely up to Sue Gray and I'll be looking forward very much to seeing what she has to say and, fingers crossed, that will be pretty soon next week.' Johnson has said he will address the Commons once the Gray report is published. The Metropolitan Police declined to identify anyone in its PS460,000 investigation. It has been reported Gray could name senior figures involved when explaining what occurred during the events. While Johnson's position as prime minister and Tory leader now looks secure, Gray's full report could contain damaging further details about rule breaking in Downing Street and Whitehall. Gray's interim report published in January said there were 'failures of leadership and judgment' that allowed rule-breaking gatherings to take place in No.10, something the full briefing is expected to expand upon.", "67d348fe14a21a24cb3600df1a74aa4d9d1643f862c45677a5a7d2fd": "Jamie Oliver wants the government to ban multi-buy deals on junk food. And considering the cost of living crisis, some people are seriously unimpressed.  It all started when the government said it would ban 'buy one get one free' deals on junk food and ban pre-watershed TV adverts for foods high in fat, salt or sugar, as part of its strategy to tackle obesity published in July 2020. The report stated that one in three children leaving primary school were overweight or obese and set out an action plan to tackle the issue. But the government later u-turned on these plans, saying it would defer action for a year while officials assess how the cost of living is affecting household finances.  If it goes ahead, the ban on multi-buy promotions will now come into effect in October 2023, whilst the ban on TV adverts would be delayed until January 2024 - and Oliver isn't pleased. Essentially, he wants the government to u-turn on its u-turn and get on with the obesity strategy ASAP.  The chef asked people to protest outside Number 10 with an Eton Mess pudding at Friday lunch time, to persuade the government to take action against junk food now.  'I've asked the British public to come and join me on Friday at 12:30. Please bring an Eton Mess. Just come and have a peaceful protest for 15 minutes,' Oliver told Channel 4. He continued: 'Part of my job, believe it or not is following graphs of how our kids are doing. And the last two years has been extraordinary bad.'  It's not the first time, the chef has campaigned on public health issues. Oliver has long campaigned on for healthier food in schools. He also teamed up with the charity Food for Life to introduce a healthy rating scheme in schools, which focused on promoting healthy food inside and out of schools whilst encouraging children to be physically active.  He's probably known most for banning Turkey Twizzlers in schools in 2005 after launching his Feed Me Better campaign, which aimed to improve the quality of school lunched. He said in 2021 that he still gets public abuse for the campaign. However, plenty of people think his current stance is tone-deaf amid the cost of living crisis and spiralling food prices.  People are arguing that Oliver's comments come from a huge place of privilege, with many stating that Olivier should offer recipes for healthy meals on a budget, rather than campaigning on banning cheap junk food.   Food inflation accelerated to 3.5% in April, up from 3.3% in March - the highest inflation rate since March 2013. Archie Norman, the chairman of Marks & Spencer, has warned food prices could even soar by as much as 10% this year, meaning the average food shop in the UK could increase by PS271 per year.  The price of oils and fats for food increased by 7.2% in March alone, adding to a more than 18% rise in the last year.  So it's no wonder that people aren't impressed by Oliver's comments.

'GOVE: SEIZE OLIGARCH MANSIONS TO HOUSE REFUGEES,' the front page headline stated. The Levelling Up Secretary wanted to put up families fleeing Vladimir Putin's war in the multi-million pound homes of the president's cronies in Britain. Among those highlighted in the article included the sanctioned Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich who reportedly had a portfolio of at least 70 properties in the UK, worth around PS500 million. Gove's plan was being blocked by senior figures in the Treasury and the Foreign Office who believed it was 'not legally workable'. But that did not deter the senior Cabinet minister who went on to tell the BBC he wanted to 'explore an option' of using sanctioned individuals' properties to house Ukrainian refugees. 'I want to explore an option which would allow us to use the homes and properties of sanctioned individuals - as long as they are sanctioned - for humanitarian and other purposes,' he told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme. The Telegraph had also earlier reported that Gove was 'drawing up plans' to confiscate oligarchs' homes without paying compensation.  However, more than two months on, very little is known about the plan and officials have been unable to say if any work has been done on its feasibility.  HuffPost UK asked the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities what work had been done, if lawyers had been instructed to look at its feasibility and if any properties had been identified as targets. However, they were not able to answer the questions, saying that they did not have any 'updates' yet but all measures were kept 'under review'.  Labour MP Lisa Nandy suggested that ministers 'float policies to generate headlines' before checking if their ideas are even legal. The shadow levelling up secretary told HuffPost UK: 'This is typical of this government. They talk a big game and hope nobody notices when nothing happens. 'They said they'd help with the cost of living, but they're prioritising energy companies' record profits over cutting bills for families. 'They promised to level up the UK, but most of the country is falling further behind. 'Michael Gove toured TV studios announcing a scheme for Ukrainian refugees before even picking up the phone to the people who would have to deliver it.  'We need a serious government, not one where ministers float policies to generate headlines before checking if their ideas are even legal.' A source close to Gove said the Foreign Office was taking over the policy on seizures.  Meanwhile, officials could only say that 'nothing is off table' and they were 'exploring' options. A government spokesperson said: 'Nothing is off the table. We are exploring what options there may be to use sanctioned property, working closely with our partners in the G7 and more broadly. 'Our priority has been helping people find sanctuary through our Ukraine schemes.' It comes after a Ukrainian MP warned yesterday that some refugees fleeing Russia's invasion were being left homeless on the streets of Britain. Speaking at an event in Westminster via video link, Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko said Ukraine had 'a lot to be grateful for' to the UK.  But she warned some people were being left 'homeless because they have been kicked out by the host'.   'OK, it's a normal people-to-people situation,' she said. 'They are all human. Circumstances change. Something went wrong in the relationship.   'But there must be some kind of a backup plan from the UK government. Where do these people go?' Richard Harrington, the minister in charge of the Ukraine refugee programme who was also speaking at the event, admitted there was a problem but said it was 'very few cases up to now'. On Thursday new government figures revealed 53,800 Ukrainians have so far arrived in the UK. Some 20,800 have come under the family scheme and 33,000 people under the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme.  The data shows 107,400 visas have been granted under both schemes, meaning just over half of those with visas granted have arrived.  The Homes for Ukraine programme places Ukrainians in the homes of ordinary Brits who volunteer to look after them. The government spokesperson added: 'Our uncapped Ukraine Family Scheme and Homes for Ukraine route are one of the fastest and biggest visa schemes in UK history.'

The Greece-born electronic musician who wrote the Academy Award-winning score, died in a French hospital on Wednesday, Greek media reported (via PA Media).  Tributes have since been pouring in as the worlds of music and film have honoured the music star. Tom Lewis and Laura Monks, co-presidents of Decca Label Group, said: 'The world has lost a genius. 'Vangelis created music of extraordinary originality and power, and provided the soundtrack to so many of our lives. 'Decca had the pleasure of partnering with Vangelis and his team for his past three albums and we will miss him enormously. 'His music will live on forever.' Vangelis was nominated for a Golden Globe and a Bafta for his score on Sir Ridley Scott's science fiction thriller Blade Runner in 1983. Filmmaker Charles de Lauzirika, who produced Blade Runner, said: 'My biggest disappointment making Dangerous Days was being unable to get Vangelis for an interview. 'His music, not just in Blade Runner, was otherworldly in beautiful and haunting ways I lack the words to describe. 'He created lush dream states I still love getting lost in.' Dutch DJ Armin van Buuren told his more than 1.6 million twitter followers he was 'sad' to hear the news. He added: 'I had the privilege to meet him in Paris last year. 'He was one of my heroes, a big inspiration and just a beautiful person. I still listen to his albums a lot.' In a tribute posted on Instagram, French musician and composer Jean-Michel Jarre said: 'We will all remember your unique touch and your moving melodies forever. 'You and I have always shared the same passion for synthesizers and electronic music since so long.' Similarly, English singer-songwriter Paul Young said he was 'very sad to hear the news of the recent passing of Vangelis.' 'I'd always loved his soundtrack to Blade Runner. 'Then in the mid 90's I had the honour of writing & singing a song on his album Voices, an immense talent that will be missed by his family, and the world of music,' he added. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and other government officials also expressed their condolences. 'Vangelis Papathanassiou is no longer among us,' Mr Mitsotakis tweeted. Born Evangelos Odysseas Papathanassiou on March 29 1943 near the city of Volos in central Greece, Vangelis started playing the piano at the age of four, although he got no formal training and claimed he never learned to read music. He played in several bands and solo, but his huge breakthrough came with the score for Chariots Of Fire, a 1981 film that told the story of two British runners in the 20s. Vangelis's score received one of the four Academy Awards the film won. The signature piece is one of the hardest-to-forget film tunes worldwide - and has also served as the musical background to endless slow-motion parodies. Vangelis later wrote musical scores for Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982) and 1492: Conquest Of Paradise (1992), as well as for Missing (1982) and Antarctica (1983), among others. When British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking died in 2018, Vangelis composed a musical tribute for his interment that the ESA broadcast into space.", "2b13063d5de8a709d33620f8d6db419d371c841745e3b686a98248e4": "Ed Sheeran and his wife Cherry Seaborn have welcomed their second child together.

Harry Styles' eagerly anticipated third album, Harry's House, is finally out and judging by the reviews, it sounds like it's been worth the two-and-a-half-year wait since he released the hugely successful Fine Line. That album topped the charts around the globe, selling millions of copies in the process, so hopes are high for the former One Direction star's follow-up. Here's what the critics are saying about Harry's House. The Independent (4/5)  'Answer the phone, Harry, you're no good alone,' goes first single As it Was, 'What kind of pills are you on?' Prince pills, it turns out. As Harry's House flings open the doors of its party garage, Styles navigates this confusing emotional territory with a funk shuffle and future soul panache worthy of the Purple One himself, while keeping one eye on the retro-modernist appeal of Silk Sonic and The Weeknd. Read the full review. NME (4/5) Harry's House' is undoubtedly Styles' best record yet and presents a musician comfortable and confident in what he wants to create right now. That gives the album a sense of warmth that makes the songs on it feel conversational and close, as if you're sitting around your own house catching up with the star... The musician's third album feels like a magical thing - a record that you want to take up residence in until you know its every nook and cranny in minute detail. Read the full review. Rolling Stone (4/5) He's pulled off the neat trick of making his music at once elegant and more refined but also warmer and more intimate -- the polished-marble smoothness of Steely Dan with the generosity of an Al Green or Yo La Tengo record. Harry's House is bright with synths and horns, often steeped in slick, sticky synth-pop and R&B. Read the full review. The Guardian (4/5) Really well-crafted pop songs, polished by Styles and his longstanding co-author Kid Harpoon to the point that pretty much any of them could happily function as a single. It's an album that, perhaps understandably, suggests an appealing confidence on the part of its authors, a world away from the classic rock cosplay of Styles's eponymous 2017 debut. Even if you don't buy the notion of Styles as a genius auteur whose oeuvre warrants comparison with the work of the artists he started his solo career aping, you'd have to concede it sounds like the work of people who know exactly what they're doing. Read the full review. Evening Standard (4/5) The 28-year-old's third studio album, is the most unconventional collection of music he's released so far. Relatively speaking, at least -- he hasn't totally abandoned the chart-topping ship and gone full Throbbing Gristle -- but from the opening track, Music for A Sushi Restaurant, it's clear that Styles isn't one to spend all his time chasing pop trends. Read the full review. The Telegraph (4/5) The third solo album from the former One Direction member - and actor, heartthrob, and international style icon - will sell by the truckload. And so it should: Harry's House is a party album with a heart, and precisely the kind of record that the world needs right now. Read the full review. Entertainment Weekly Styles' third album, is a pop album because of the stature of its star. But like its effervescent lead single, As It Was, it gently nudges the expectations of what pop should sound like in 2022. It has the mood of a laid-back afternoon sifting through a friend's impeccably assembled if interestingly organised record collection, with the singer slyly dropping hints about his day-to-day -- the maturation of his wine tastes, his breakfast order, his preferred party favours -- over songs that share a vibe more than they do a particular musical aesthetic.

Page Six Harry's House is the former One Direction heartthrob's biggest sonic shift yet, leaving behind the '70s rock vibe that launched his magnetic solo career in 2017 and the shrooms that helped piece together his 2019 follow-up, Fine Line, for a fantastically funky and staggeringly intimate record fitting for its title... Some may argue that Harry's House, as joyous as it is, isn't as instant or radio-friendly as Fine Line, but that's the beauty of a virtuoso like Styles. He's a 21st century rock god who doesn't need to cater to anyone. After all, we're only guests in his house. Read the full review. Slant (3/5) With 2019's Fine Line, Harry Styles seemed to attempt to reinvent himself as a Bowie-esque shapeshifter whose public persona and style was as chameleonic as that of the thin white duke. But where that album dabbled in the sounds and aesthetics of 1970s folk and pop, the singer's follow-up, Harry's House, moves into the '80s, drawing on new wave and synth-pop and blanketing the album with a more polished sheen... Styles may be a fashion trendsetter, but with Harry's House, he continues trying on different styles in an effort to discover his own. Read the full review.

Or are you a dweller who takes a while to absorb every word - and page?  Whatever your style, there's a new hack for speed reading doing the rounds on Twitter right now. It's called 'bionic reading' and it's really dividing people. Typography expert Renato Casutt from Switzerland has been working on the new approach, which guides readers through text using 'artificial fixation points'. This means bolding or highlighting the letters at the beginning of a word with the aim of allowing reader's brain to identify them with less effort and concentration. In theory, this means you can speed up how quickly you read as you don't need to focus on the whole of every word. This is because your brain actually reads faster than your eye, having stored up a dictionary of words from all the past reading you've ever done. 'Your brain is a super computer and does a very good job at reading,' the site explains. 'Bionic Reading revises texts so that the most concise parts of words are highlighted. This guides the eye over the text and the brain remembers previously learned words more quickly.' An example was shared on Twitter, with a regular and 'bionic' text side by side to demonstrate how we would normally read text and how the new technique might help. Try reading the words below yourself. People are certainly impressed, with several different posts sharing the hack going viral, but many are also conflicted about whether the new technique is a good or bad thing for readers. Some welcomed the new approach. 'It's incredible how reading this feels like finally unlocking 100% of your brain', wrote one Twitter user, who suggested someone at Twitter should 'turn it on'. But others worried that speed reading in this way was 'robotic', would take the joy out of reading, and might stop you from retaining any of the information. One even called it a 'sickening technoperversion'. Some Twitter users said it could help those with cognitive issues, such as dyslexia or ADHD, while others suggested it would do the opposite and make it more difficult, as they may likely already substitute a 'close enough' word, which could change the whole context of what was being read. 'Not sure if this helps me, but I don't think it hinders me, and I wouldn't mind reading text augmented this way. And if it helps some people a lot, it's worth implementing as an option, especially since it's so simple,' another wrote. If you're worried about this form taking over all your reading material, don't fret, it's unlikely to happen anytime soon. 'Bionic reading' is still in the early stages of development and is something you can access via a paid app. So unless you really really want it, you can carry on reading as normal. Slowly does it.", "723a52ec2ec469ce9474c7b871fb7048fe9d317fa29e59ce150d8317": "Another season, another vaccine. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has advised the government to provide an autumn Covid-19 booster programme. The government has confirmed the autumn programme will be rolled out ahead of the winter months, when Covid-19 infections typically increase. Here's what we know about the autumn jabs so far.  Who will be eligible for autumn vaccines?  Those in 'older age groups', residents in care homes for older adults, frontline health and social care workers, and those with certain underlying health conditions receive a booster vaccine ahead of the winter period. 'Older age groups' is most likely to mean over 75s, like the spring vaccine rollout, although this detail is to be confirmed.  Why are autumn vaccines needed?  We know that the protection offered by vaccines wanes over time and although you can still catch Covid after a vaccine, receiving a jab reduces the chance of severe symptoms and hospitalisation. This is especially important for those in vulnerable groups. Professor Wei Shen Lim, chair of Covid-19 vaccination on the JCVI, said that last year's autumn booster programme provided 'excellent protection' against Covid-19. 'Last year's autumn booster vaccination programme provided excellent protection against severe Covid-19, including against the Omicron variant. 'We have provided interim advice on an autumn booster programme for 2022 so that the NHS and care homes are able to start the necessary operational planning, to enable high levels of protection for more vulnerable individuals and frontline healthcare staff over next winter. 'As we continue to review the scientific data, further updates to this advice will follow.' What happens next?  The Department of Health welcomed the recommendations, adding that they have asked NHS England to begin preparations for next winter. 'We welcome the interim advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) for an autumn Covid booster programme and will consider their final recommendations later this year,' a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said. 'We have asked the NHS in England to begin preparations to ensure they are ready to deploy Covid vaccines to those eligible.' The exact start date of the autumn rollout will be announced closer to the time. It's expected that those eligible will be able to book online, as with previous vaccine appointments.

Well, now the BBC has decided to throw some hard hats and paint rollers into the mix on a brand new show for the pair, and it sounds like a right old romp.  They are joining forces to renovate a dilapidated home in Italy in Amanda And Alan: The Italian Job. The pair bought adjoining flats in rural Sicily - for a total of two euros - which they will knock together and transform into a large holiday home during the show. The eight-part series will follow the duo as they roll up their sleeves trying their hand at skills from plumbing to painting and plastering, as well as throwing themselves into the local lifestyle and exploring the region of Italy. The completed property will go on sale at the end of the summer with all profits donated to charity. They have both renovated their own properties in the past but neither has tackled a project of this magnitude before. Alan said: 'After presenting two series of Interior Design Masters I feel now it's time for me to pop my hard hat on, slip on my steel toe-capped boots and really get my hands dirty. 'Working in beautiful Sicily with one of my dearest friends is like I've won the jackpot. 'Expect a summer of drilling, demolition and hopefully la dolce vita.' Mandy said: 'Alan and I came up with the idea for this show together and approached the BBC as we knew it was the perfect home. 'We are both very passionate about interior design and we'll be very hands on, injecting some much needed life into an area of Sicily that's in need of some Holden and Carr magic. 'Although we're on the same page most of the time, I'm more practical and organised than Alan. 'However, he's up for some shameless bargaining so that will help us keep on budget. 'We've already started filming and one thing's for sure, we're not shy of a power tool.' An airdate for Amanda And Alan: The Italian Job is yet to be announced.

Later this year, the singer will be seen alongside Emma Corrin in a big-screen adaptation of the novel My Policeman, as well as the psychological thriller Don't Worry Darling, the director of which, Olivia Wilde, he began dating in 2020. Speaking on The Howard Stern Show on SiriusXM (via ET), Harry said he appears naked in My Policeman, but did not bare all on camera due to his contract. 'It does feel vulnerable. I'd never kissed anyone on camera before and it felt like giving a part of myself away in some ways,' he said. 'I wasn't naked in Don't Worry Darling. I was naked in My Policeman. There's no peen in the final cut. There's bum bum... I don't think the peen was intended to be involved. 'The peen, it was pre-negotiated that that would remain my own.' My Policeman sees Emma portraying a woman who marries a police officer, played by Harry, who is secretly having a relationship with another man. He added of filming sex scenes: 'I think the most important thing in that stuff is trust. I think if you speak about it properly with everyone that's involved [that helps],' he said of filming intimate scenes. 'If you remember that the most important thing on the set is the two human beings doing it. If at any point either one of you is uncomfortable, I think having the conversation where it's like, 'It doesn't matter if they're getting great stuff, if you don't feel good, you tell me and we'll stop.'' Harry, who made his acting debut in Christopher Nolan's 2017 war epic Dunkirk, also said he had a 'wonderful experience being directed by Olivia' in Don't Worry Darling.  The film stars Harry and Florence Pugh as a 1950s couple named Alice and Jack. In the film, a 'housewife living with her husband in a utopian experimental community begins to worry that his glamorous company may be hiding disturbing secrets'. He said: 'Acting is kind of very uncomfortable at times. I think you have to trust a lot. It requires a lot of trust if you want to give it everything. I think being able to trust your director is a gift. That was very helpful. It really meant for kind of a really nice experience working on that movie.' 'I think it's really fun. I think ultimately, in terms of the trust element, it can feel really silly,' Harry added of acting. 'It can feel embarrassing. You're playing pretend ultimately.'

Ever since Anne started presenting the Channel 4 show, which she recently stepped down from, there have been persistent rumours of a rift between herself and the show's resident maths expert. Despite both of them playing down the rumours during Anne's year-long tenure as the show's host, the former Weakest Link presenter didn't exactly do much to dispel the stories when she was asked by Piers about her relationship with Rachel. 'No, I think Susie Dent is great,' Anne replied. Ouch. She then added: 'Erm... Rachel Riley is completely brilliant at the maths.' Anne then went on to explain that it was 'important' that Rachel's microphone was switched off before they started recording each show. 'I didn't not get on,' she said. 'But some performers like a lot of noise around them before they go on air and others like me who are trying to get the contestants to remember what their hobbies are would like some quiet while she's doing that. 'It was important to me we took her mic off.' Earlier this month, the veteran presenter described press reports that she doesn't get on with Rachel as 'nonsense' but admitted they're not especially close. 'I'm not saying I would go on holiday with Rachel Riley, but she is brilliant,' Anne told the Daily Mail. 'Absolutely honestly, I do admire her - she is really, really good at what she does, as is Susie Dent.' 'Look, Rachel has just come back from having a baby and she is standing throughout and faultless, whereas I get to sit down,' she continued. 'She is noisy, yes she and Susie both are - they are a formidable pair those two. But there isn't a question of my going because of a rift, that's nonsense.' Rachel has previously admitted that Anne was 'not the cuddliest person in the world' amid reports of behind-the-scenes feuding, but played down rumours of any on-set tension. 'It's just a different show now, she's making it her own,' Rachel said last year. 'She's getting some stuff out of the contestants - sometimes it's barbed, sometimes it's funny, it's just got a different flavour.' Anne joined the long-running letters and numbers quiz show last year, becoming its sixth presenter and the first woman to take on presenting duties. She took over from The Apprentice's Nick Hewer following his 10 year run at the helm. Anne, who has fronted 265 episodes, revealed she had already 'stayed longer than I signed up for.'

William and Kate stole the show as they swooped down on the red carpet for the UK premiere of the blockbuster held in London's Leicester Square. The couple dressed to impress as they arrived at the event, chatting to film fans on their way into the cinema. Two children who spoke to William and Kate revealed the couple's own brood, George, Charlotte and Louis, were gutted to miss the glitzy screening. Nine-year-old Alfie Everett-Fletcher, who met William at the cinema, said: 'He asked me what I liked about the last one, the things I like, if I like jets and planes and motorbikes.'   Alfie said William told him he is a 'big fan' of the film and 'cars and stuff'. His mother Elise Everett added: 'He said they have had the theme tune for the film playing with their kids.' Alfie also said William told him his own children were 'jealous' to miss the premiere. They joined Hollywood royalty Tom Cruise, who reprised his role as hotshot US fighter pilot Captain Pete 'Maverick' Mitchell for the eagerly awaited sequel to the 1986 movie. William sported a dapper Alexander McQueen tuxedo and Kate wore a black and white Roland Mouret dress as they dazzled at the Royal Film Performance screening. William, who served as a pilot in the East Anglian Air Ambulance from March 2015 to July 2017, wore Crockett & Jones loafers with 'F-18' embroidered on them, a nod to the fighter jets in the movie.   Tom earlier told the PA news agency he had 'a lot in common' with William. 'We both love England, and we're both aviators, we both love flying,' he said. The 59-year-old actor introduced William and Kate to his co-stars in front of a model of a fighter plane from the film, which had 'Capt Pete Mitchell Maverick' emblazoned on it near the cockpit. 'I love what I do, I've always enjoyed it and I'm enjoying it even more now,' Tom said. 'Particularly after the last couple of years, just to have an event like this is extraordinary.' Miles Teller, Jennifer Connelly, Monica Barbaro, Val Kilmer, Jon Hamm and Glen Powell also star in the long-awaited blockbuster. Jon Hamm, who plays Cyclone, said: 'Well, you want to be prepared obviously but you want to be able to bring what you bring to it, your particular skill set.'   The film was originally due for release in July 2019 but was repeatedly pushed back due to the coronavirus pandemic. The fundraising event was hosted by Paramount Pictures and The Film and TV charity, which supports people working behind the scenes in the UK's screen sector.

In her speech to 2022 graduates, Swift talked about how common it is to cringe when you think back on your past. But there was one theme she highlighted throughout her talk: She is not a fan of receiving advice she hadn't asked for. 'As a rule, I try not to give anyone unsolicited advice unless they ask for it,' Swift said, noting it can do more harm that good. 'As a person who started my very public career at the age of 15, it came with a price. And that price was years of unsolicited advice,' Swift said. 'Being the youngest person in every room for over a decade meant that I was constantly being issued warnings from older members of the music industry, the media, interviewers, executives. This advice often presented itself as thinly veiled warnings. 'See, I was a teenager in the public eye at a time when our society was absolutely obsessed with the idea of having perfect young female role models. It felt like every interview I did included slight barbs by the interviewer about me one day 'running off the rails.'' Swift's thoughts about unsolicited career advice begin at 1:14:52 below. You may not sell over 100 million albums and win three Grammys for Album of the Year, but if you are beginning your career or at a crossroads, you are bound to get finger-wagging advice from people who want to impart their own wisdom -- or you might occasionally be tempted to share your own.  Unsolicited career advice is not all bad. But before you give it, do a gut check on why Career coach Jasmine Escalera says that she appreciates when people share their experiences and would have enjoyed hearing that more often when she was a young person navigating her career. 'As the first in my family to attend college [and] graduate school and navigate a high-level career, I would have enjoyed the opportunity to obtain every nugget of career advice I could,' she said. 'I could not be educated on navigating this new space by my family or community. And any advice they provided was based on their own limiting beliefs and lack of experience, which were not in service of the growth and opportunities I had the privilege to receive. I often wonder how my career would have been different if I had more women of colour around me to speak about their journeys and offer wisdom that was not available to me.' But on the flip side, Escalera said even when advice is warranted, those giving it need to be careful to make sure that their support is not just a projection of their own experiences and challenges. 'As someone giving advice, we must be aware that without knowing an individual's story, struggle and tenacity, we cannot know what situations will arise for them individually or even how they would handle them if they do,' she said. 'Advice should always be given to help, and never assume that every situation or circumstance will be the same for each individual.' Too often, mentors project their own anxieties and fears onto those at the beginning of their careers. Swift shared that all the unsolicited advice she received communicated the warning 'that if I didn't make any mistakes, all the children of America would grow up to be perfect angels. However, if I did slip up, the entire earth would fall off its axis and it would be entirely my fault and I would go to pop star jail forever and ever,' she said. 'It was all centred around the idea that mistakes equal failure, and ultimately, the loss of any chance at a happy or rewarding life.' The truth is, everyone's path will be different. 'Your experience is not the experience,' says psychotherapist Shannon Garcia. 'That can be a hard one to swallow, especially when we want to help someone we care about. But it is true. You may have dealt with certain situations in your career and you may have figured out some helpful things. And still, this individual will have their own experience, and no one knows their life better than they do. Ask yourself, 'Can I let this person handle this on their own?'' Determine if someone wants to hear advice or if they want to be validated When someone does talk to you about navigating their work life, you should take a step back and see if they want to have their hopes and dreams validated, or if they want practical advice on how to get there.  'If they are sharing about their career, ask yourself, 'How can I listen to them right now?' Start with listening, like, truly listening when they are talking,' Garcia said. 'People are usually not looking for advice and more so needing validation from you.' You can make yourself available when the person is ready by sharing directly that you're there for them if they need advice or by asking if there is anything they think they need help with, Garcia suggested. That way, the person can decide if they want your advice before you decide for them.  If you want to really help someone, try offering up your network. 'One of the biggest hurdles that young adults have today, especially those who are navigating professions and spaces that no one else in their family or immediate circles work in, is access to social capital,' says Anyelis Cordero, founder of Propel on Purpose Coaching, a career coaching service designed for first-generation professionals. 'Instead of offering unsolicited advice, offer an introduction to someone in your network that can share insights about the industry, company or job they're interested in pursuing.' When you are in a position of power, your words and actions hold immense weight. And that's a responsibility you should not take lightly, whether you are talking to a pop star or someone embarking on a new career path. Cordero says she has seen clients who pursued certain career paths because of the pressure of someone else's advice instead of listening to their own instincts. 'It's not that young adults don't want your advice; it's that being inundated by different advice starts to crowd [their] own voice,' she says. 'Your words could be the thing that sways someone's career for the better,' Escalera says. 'And wouldn't we all want that kind of help to guide our way?'

On the heels of major buzz surrounding her roles in Barbie and a Pirates Of The Caribbean spinoff, Margot will team up once again with Bombshell director Jay Roach for a new entry in the blockbuster heist franchise, according to The Hollywood Reporter.  No additional details about the Warner Bros. film have been released, except that the project will be an 'original Ocean's Eleven that is set in Europe in the 1960s' with a script from Carrie Solomon. The film is still currently in development and has not been officially greenlighted by the studio, per the outlet, which notes that the 'goal is to begin production spring 2023'.  Loosely inspired by the 1960 Rat Pack movie of the same name, Ocean's Eleven hit cinemas in 2001 with director Steven Soderbergh at the helm and a megawatt cast including George Clooney, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts. The film's critical and commercial success paved the way for two more sequels from Soderbergh and a female-fronted spinoff Ocean's 8 in 2018, which starred Sandra Bullock as the sister to Clooney's character, Danny Ocean.  In total, the franchise has grossed over $1 billion at the global box office, becoming a jewel in the Warner Bros. film slate.  As for Margot, she has a slew of high-profile projects on the horizon.  In addition to starring in Gerwig's Barbie, which she is also producing under her banner LuckyChap, the Oscar nominee is set to appear in David O'Russell's period drama Amsterdam, as well as Damien Chazell's Babylon alongside former Ocean's cast member Brad Pitt.

Speaking at the Cannes Film Festival for a powerful Women In Motion conversation on Thursday, the Oscar-winning actor said an unnamed director once referred to her by his maid's name. 'And I'd known him for like, 10 years,' she said. 'And he called me Louise, and I found out it was because his maid's name was Louise.' 'I was maybe around 30 at the time, so it was a while ago. But what you have to realise is that those microaggressions happen all the time,' she explained. The actor also spoke about times she'd been told she wasn't 'pretty enough' for certain roles. 'It breaks my heart, and it makes me angry,' she said. 'For many reasons. A lot of it is based in race. It really is. Because let's be honest; if I had my same features and I were five shades lighter, it would just be a little bit different.' Viola recently starred as Michelle Obama in The First Lady, which wraps up its 10-episode season in June, and also recently released her memoir, Finding Me.

The new series follows a group of LGBTQ friends in New Orleans whose livelihoods are thrown into disarray following a tragedy that recalls the 2016 Pulse nightclub massacre. Based on the early footage, there are also compelling storylines involving politics and parenthood, not to mention plenty of sex.  Actors Fin Argus, CG, Jesse James Keitel, Ryan O'Connell, Johnny Sibilly and Devin Way are among the series regulars. The starry recurring cast includes Kim Cattrall, Lukas Gage, Juliette Lewis and Megan Stalter.  Created by Russell T. Davies, the original Queer As Folk premiered on Channel 4 in the UK in 1999 and followed three gay men in Manchester. A US series based on the British iteration premiered a year later, with the acting moving to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and ran for five seasons.  Viewers are likely more familiar with the American series, which starred Gale Harold and Randy Harrison. The new Queer as Folk, however, is believed to be more in line with the British original.  And much like the Sex and the City revival And Just Like That..., the new series appears to have greatly diversified its storytelling, adding more actors of colour, as well as transgender and gender nonconforming people, into the mix.  In an emailed statement, Russell T Davies described the 2022 iteration of Queer As Folk as 'more diverse, more wild, more free, more angry -- everything a queer show should be'.  'I'm very proud of what we achieved in 1999, but in queer years, that was a millennium ago,' explained Russell, who serves as an executive producer on the reboot. 'As a community, we've radicalised, explored, opened up, and found new worlds -- with new enemies and new allies -- and there was so much to be said.' Writer and director Stephen Dunn feels similarly and said he hopes to depict 'an electric ensemble of fresh characters that mirror the modern global audience'. 'If there's one person who is able to see Queer As Folk and feel less alone, or who now feels more supported and seen, our job is done,' he added. 'In the true spirit of the original, our show doesn't shy away from the harsh realities of our community, but above all else, the series is about people who live vibrant, vital, unapologetically queer lives.'  Queer As Folk debuts on Peacock in the US on 9 June, and will be available to stream via Starzplay in the UK from 1 July, with two new episodes airing each week.", "3dec9efd5977af40c129534f4f6e066ee568a96694dd5f1f410f5664": "Dominic Raab has clashed with the BBC's Charlie Stayt over the price of petrol, asking the Breakfast presenter: 'I'm just checking how in touch you are.' During a tetchy interview on Friday morning, Stayt asked the deputy prime minister how much a litre of diesel costs. Raab said that he buys unleaded, and the last time he visited a petrol station it was 1.65-1.67 per litre. But, Stayt said that it had 'gone up' recently, adding: 'What's happening in the real world is that people try and deal with things and those pump prices, as you pass them, they go up by the day.' Raab then asked Stayt: 'Well you tell me, what's a litre of unleaded today? The BBC presenter said that the highest price he had seen for diesel recently was 1.99 per litre at a service station on the M6. Raab pressed again on the price of unleaded: 'I'm just checking how in touch you are, because last time I looked it was 165-167.' Stayt said that 168 was the latest price that he had seen for unleaded. The deputy prime minister replied: 'I'm just making the point that I'm actually right about the cost of a litre of unleaded.'

The 66-year-old confirmed he had left the BBC dance show during an appearance on Thursday's edition of The One Show, and also took the opportunity to give his verdict on his replacement - Anton Du Beke. Bruno, who has been a judge on Strictly since it launched in 2004, said his travel commitments had made it 'impossible' to continue. Instead, he will be focussing on his other role as a judge on Dancing With The Stars, which films around the same time of year in the US. 'What's happened with Covid, the travelling situation is so unpredictable,' Bruno explained. 'I used to leave on a Sunday and fly back on Thursday to do the show in London. 'It was impossible because the rules changed, getting through the airport was not like it used to be, it created a situation that was unsustainable. I miss it so much. 'Unfortunately Dancing With The Stars has moved to Disney+ which is a big deal. Because of the travel situation I will be there.' In 2020, pandemic travel uncertainty meant Bruno could only appear via video-link to give his verdict on the performances during the Sunday night results show. And last year he was replaced by long-standing professional dancer Anton who joined the panel alongside Craig Revel Horwood, Motsi Mabuse and Shirley Ballas. 'I think Anton has done a fantastic job, he deserves to be on that seat... it's a 10 from me, carry on, do me proud,' Bruno said. And in a message to the other judges, Bruno added: 'Shirley my love, you will be much safer with Anton. 'Motsi don't worry about Craig, he is just jealous because he cannot wear your clothes, Craig is just Craig and behind the scenes he is more fun than me, he is so cool and laid back. Bruno revealed that Strictly fans may still see him in related events such as the post-show arena tour, in which he was a judge earlier this year. 'I may do the tour, I am not gone forever, don't count me out, I will always be part of the family. We created the show,' he said. 'I am not going anywhere, it is impossible I cannot do it. The panel were so good last year, they were brilliant. They have all my support, so hopefully we will do something else.' Bruno joined Strictly during its debut series in 2004 alongside the original judges Dame Arlene Phillips, Len Goodman and Craig Revel Horwood.

In April, she celebrated the debut of her R.E.M. makeup line at Ulta by posting a photo on Instagram showing her sporting elongated, nearly monolidded eyes and uncharacteristically light skin. While many fans were quick to cheer on Grande's new look, others were quick to criticise her for Asianfishing, or mimicking Asian features as a style choice. This isn't the first time Grande has been accused of masquerading as a different race. The singer has been called out on numerous occasions for appropriating Black and Latina culture, so much so that she's spawned her own category of memes. (It's worth noting here that Asianfishing is derived from the term 'Blackfishing' which was coined by Wanna Thompson to address white people capitaliisng off of Black culture and beauty.) But Grande's racially ambiguous take on East Asian aesthetics is part of a relatively new trend - adopting Asian physical traits to achieve an ethnically ambiguous, vaguely 'exotic' look. How looking Asian and ethnically ambiguous became 'cool' in the West Beauty techniques and products from Asia have been popular abroad for several years now, but the trend of physically resembling an Asian person has only gained steam somewhat recently. 'Our team of AAPI women and allies in the field of plastic surgery noticed the recent resurgence of the 'fox eye' amongst Western social media influencers in early 2021,' Waverley He, an incoming plastic surgery resident who researches the intersection of cosmetic surgery and racial diversity, tells HuffPost. Since April 2018, Google search interest for the term 'fox eye,' a cosmetic procedure or makeup look that creates a slanted eye shape, has roughly doubled. Same for the phrases 'brow lift' and 'brow surgery,' which refer to a procedure designed to elevate eyebrows and expand eyelid space. While elongated eyes and unhooded lids aren't exclusively Asian traits, the overall effect of non-Asians adopting these features creates an ethnically ambiguous look, one that's both recognizably racial and disconnected from the aesthetic's cultural origins. Multiple experts HuffPost spoke to cited the global rise of K-pop, along with the prevalence of social media, as key factors in the West's fascination with Asian aesthetics. 'Pop culture has evolved our idealization of beauty standards,' plastic surgeon Dr. Kimberly Lee says. Lee also notes that over the last few years, there's been heightened interest among Asians in looking, well, Asian. 'In the past, there was an interest in Westernising Asian faces, as that was thought to be desirable. However, as time has evolved, most patients seek to preserve their ethnicity while enhancing their appearance,' Lee says. 'These features are what makes us all unique but are also thought of as being exotic and attractive.' When do you cross a line into Asianfishing? Because Asian people are not a monolith - the umbrella term 'Asian American' encompasses about 50 different ethnic groups, for example - it can be tricky to clearly delineate when someone is adopting an 'Asian' look. Even in the case of Grande's controversy, people online defended the pop star and argued that those who said she looked Asian were the racist ones, not her. And Grande's defenders do have a point, sort of. There are a million different ways to 'appear Asian,' and it can feel reductive to claim that a lightened complexion and swipe of eyeliner is enough to make Florida-raised, Italian American Grande appear East Asian. 'It feels like Western society decided foxy eyes and brow lifts are 'Asian,'' says Anna Ling, the model and creative director behind Maruchi House. But while there's no objective threshold for when something becomes Asianfishing, ignoring public outcry over appropriation perpetuates Asian people's long-standing problems with erasure in the US - and beyond. 'Dismissing racial motivation just reinforces the fact that so much of the racism and microaggressions that we face as Asians is largely unknown or invisible to the general population,' says Melissa Magsaysay, a fashion and beauty journalist who leads content on Thirteen Lune, an e-commerce site elevating beauty brands by people of colour. 'To tell an Asian person that emulating our eyes is not racist is the same kind of gaslighting we experienced across the board for so long.' Additionally, He notes that 'while those pursuing an 'ethnically ambiguous look' may be motivated by cultural or aesthetic appreciation, I would consider the impacts these trends have on minority populations rather than the intentions of mainstream adopters.' Asianfishing and anti-Asian hate crimes are both on the rise For many Asian Americans, it's hard to see Asian features becoming trendy while anti-Asian stigma and violence continue largely unchecked in the U.S. According to He, Asian women's exoticisation in the US dates back to the Page Act of 1875, which banned Asian women from entering the country under the assumption that they were prostitutes and labourers. Centuries later, biases against Asian women as outsiders persist. During a time where a growing number of Asian Americans - particularly Asian women - report being victims of hate crimes, the idea of non-Asians gaining cultural cachet for the same traits that people of color are penalized for can spark anger and disillusionment. 'As Asian women continue to experience discrimination and harassment related to their features, I am reminded that despite almond-shaped eyes being vogue, Western cultural and beauty standards dominate,' He said. 'Historically, we have been celebrated for certain things, but ignored, criticised and stereotyped for other things,' Magsaysay says. 'Picking what suits you about an entire people is not just hurtful, it perpetuates the notion that we are not considered or useful in our fullness and beauty.' Ethnically ambiguous beauty trends are a far cry from deadly attacks on Asian Americans. But as Stacy Lee Kong argued in a recent newsletter, 'it's hard not to think about how these different types of dehumanisation inform one another.' In order to imagine a future where Asians aren't struggling with racist threats and discrimination, Asian people's humanity must be accepted in full - not just as piecemeal trends that lack deeper cultural understanding. 'There will always be a group of people that imitate, but don't appreciate the culture, heritage and traditions regarding beauty,' Ling says. 'However, as ... beauty standards diversify, I hope more people can appreciate and relate to the 'new' trends in the mainstream. I want to see Asian people as a part of the bigger picture rather than a token for others to excel.' Magsaysay echoes her point. 'We are beautiful in our entirety at all times, not just when it's most convenient,' she says.", "6b5af837675252d967a1cba2ca87cb86a414cc0db1929684b4251ad0": "Friday night is not it. That's because Wednesday is the new Thursday and Thursday is the new Friday. And if you're not following us, you're probably not one of the millions in the UK who've embraced hybrid working. New data from Freespace, a technology company that has 120,000 workplace sensors in offices across the country, shows that less than 15% of desks were occupied last Friday. But the number was closer to 40% on Wednesday.  It's why hybrid workers have been given the cheeky nickname TWATs, representing the days we're most likely to come into the office: Tuesday, Wednesdays and Thursdays It appears that given the choice, few of us choose to kick off our weekends with a Friday commute. And as a result, the pattern of our social lives is also shifting. Thursday has long been the preferred evening for a weekday night out among professionals. It's the perfect day to have drinks with colleagues or grab dinner with pals because a) you only have Friday to get through, b) your Saturday isn't ruined with a hangover, and c) you've recovered in time for another BNO on Saturday night, should you feel inclined.  It just makes sense. But it seems workers are increasingly choosing to move their social calendars forwards by a day - and the hospitality industry is seeing the impact. 'Our busiest night used to be Friday but post lockdown everything has changed,' Phil Inzani, owner of the Polo Bar in the City of London, told the Times. 'Fridays are now quieter but Wednesday and Thursday are much busier. A lot of the Friday night trade has moved to Thursday and the Thursday night trade to Wednesday. 'This is the new normal now and what we take into account when we do our planning. Friday used to be a big day for hospitality in the City generally but now you can see the streets are empty.' It's a timetable that's more popular with workers like Lekha Ly, a 31-year-old senior PR Manager at Yard. 'In a post pandemic world my favourite night out is no longer on a Friday,' she says. 'As I no longer go in to the office, I can go out for dinner and wine on a quieter night like Wednesday or Thursday (when I am more likely to get a seat in a bar and take advantage of off-peak pricing) and not have to worry about being up early to commute the next day. 'As soon as the week ends on Friday, there's nothing that I want more than a home cooked meal followed by chocolate and sofa time. At the end of the working week, I am usually tired and now I can fully embrace that and not go out, get an early night so I can be fresh for the weekend.'  Perhaps the pandemic has also encouraged us to embrace more downtime. Although Ly does add: 'I'm 31, probably also why I don't want to go out on a Friday!'  Given the shift, those organising work parties might also want to get with the times. A recent survey of 2,000 UK workers conducted by the events company Headbox found just 25% said they'd prefer work parties to be held on a Friday or over the weekend. The majority (75%) prefer a weeknight for a social event. Given how expensive it is to work in the office compared to working from home, it's hardly surprising many of us are cutting down our in-person hours. But if you still want a mid-week night out that isn't completely dead, Wednesday could be just the ticket.

The government is pushing for a 'rapid return' of officials to their Whitehall desks after working from home became the norm during the pandemic. Boris Johnson widened the call last week as he urged businesses to help boost the economy by doing the same as Covid-19 eases - referring to the temptation of cheese as he suggested working from home does not work. Last month, Rees-Mogg - a government minister with responsibility for efficiency - was labelled a 'nasty patronising man' after leaving notes on the desks of civil servants who were not in the office. It read: 'Sorry you were out when I visited. I look forward to seeing you in the office very soon. Wish every good wish.' On Question Time from Liverpool on Thursday, an audience member took issue with Rees-Mogg's 'smarmy' note. She said: 'I think that civil service leaders should let adults do the adulting and decide what's best for ourselves, instead of the likes of Rees-Mogg leaving smarmy messages. 'I prefer to work from home and, in my department in the civil service, it's been proven that we are far more productive working from home, plus the fact it's getting to the point where I can't afford the fuel to drive into the city centre anyway.' Her comments were echoed by some of the panelists appearing on the BBC's flagship political show. Labour's Lucy Powell described Rees-Mogg as 'a terrible head boy prefect at some awful public school'. The shadow cabinet minister added: 'He's like the opposite of modern Britain, going around and sticking Post-it notes on people's desks.' SNP frontbencher Alyn Smith added: 'My concern with the current government is that they've got an ideological agenda to get people back into the office, whether it was working for them or not, because the economy is somehow powered by lunchtime sandwiches. 'Lots of people do know exactly what's best for them, and people should be allowed to make their own decisions, and we should see more flexibility in the world of work and less ideology.'  In response to the criticism, government minister Lucy Frazer said: 'I think there are some downsides to working at home. I think, for young people starting, they need to learn and have mentors and learn from seniors and, if everyone is at home, it's very difficult for the young people to get the skills that they need. 'The second thing is I am really worried about people's mental health, particularly young people. Somebody mentioned we are social animals. We might all think we are OK working at home but, actually, that social interaction is really important, and I think loneliness, particularly over the period of the pandemic, and it will be becoming an increasing problem. 'Thirdly, I mentioned, when you asked me what were we going to do, what was our plan in relation to improving growth and productivity, one of the headings is about skills and people, and if we want to upskill people and retrain them, you can do some of that at home, but you can also do some of it quite well when you are in the office as well.'", "45a46de9983eede02bea325652b7e0344dc741e8312e3e4ad790b267": "", "910497364d0392cfcbf065289296ab9f92a0904d0f64b8d3fd1bed7c": "An appearance by culture secretary Nadine Dorries at a select committee hearing is becoming must-watch TV. In November, the gaffe-prone Tory minister didn't fully grasp how Channel 4 was funded - an important detail since she is in charge of selling-off the broadcaster. And on Thursday, Dorries left viewers stunned as she responded to questions from the digital, culture, media and sport committee of MPs about online safety and public service broadcasters. Specifically, she was quizzed about the government's decision on Channel 4, the review of the BBC's funding model and where Netflix and its subscription model fits in. Here are her best bits. 1. Sharing Netflix account: 'Am I not supposed to do that?' The culture secretary admitted she shares her Netflix password with four other households across the country. Dorries said four other people, including her mother, have access to her account with the streaming service, in breach of its terms and conditions which say users must live together.  She described the current system for subscribers as 'incredibly generous'. She added: 'My mum has access to my account, the kids do. I have Netflix but there are four other people who can use my Netflix account in different parts of the country.' Laughing, she added: 'Am I not supposed to do that?' Her department's permanent secretary, Sarah Healey, reportedly told her that password sharing was not allowed on the service.  2. Channel 4 'didn't do themselves any favours' Asked what she thinks about Channel 4 News, Dorries said she 'gets on really well' with presenter Cathy Newman and had been asked on a number of times in the last two weeks, although she had declined. But in an apparent reference to eyewitness reports that former anchor Jon Snow shouted 'Fuck the Tories' while at Glastonbury Festival five years ago, she added: 'I have been on Channel 4 News a number of times. It is edgy. I am not going to justify a news programme whose anchor went out shouting obscenities about the Conservative Party. 'So they didn't do themselves any favours sometimes on the news programme and I think that is probably as much as I want to say about that.' 3. Fears profitable Channel 4 will 'hits the buffers' Dorries said Channel 4's pool of advertising budget had 'reduced considerably', justifying the decision to sell off the broadcaster, and that a platform such as Netflix would be another attractive prospect to advertisers. She said: 'If Channel 4 were to suffer as a result of decreased advertising, if all the advertising pool decided to go and spend it all on Netflix advertising ... if Channel 4 hits the buffers it's up to the government to pick that up, the taxpayer.' But Channel 4 achieved record financial results last year - something the government could only dream of - while Netflix last month suffered its first subscriber loss in more than a decade, causing its shares to plunge 25% in extended trading. Channel 4 has been publicly owned since its creation in 1982 by the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher, and is entirely funded by advertising. 4. 'I think the figure was about 96%' Dorries was asked by the SNP's John Nicolson about her Channel 4 privatisation consultation, and how many people supported the move 'I think the figure was about 96%,' she replied, fairly confidently. But Nicolson corrected her afterwards, saying 'the answer, of course, is 96% opposed privatisation'. 5. 'They were actually actors' In another attack on Channel 4, Dorries accused the broadcaster of hiring paid actors for a reality television show she appeared in 12 years ago. Dorries was one of four new MPs to appear in Tower Block of Commons, where they all spent a week living on a different housing estate. At one stage, she apparently smuggled in a PS50 note, which she claimed was intended to buy gifts for the children of her hosts. During the hearing on Thursday, Dorries claimed the hosts were planted by the show's producers, and that a 'pharmacist or somebody that I went to see who prepared food' was also a paid actress. A Channel 4 spokesperson: 'This is the first suggestion we have heard that viewers were misled about contributors on Tower Block of Commons. We will be contacting the secretary of state to seek further details so that we can investigate it thoroughly.'", "8513ea378fccfd11afe4c045f8c034cf2675ebcc0f08c60466de4c94": "Rihanna's reign of supreme maternity fashion seems to have come to an end -- for now at least. The Love on the Brain singer and her boyfriend, rapper A$AP Rocky, welcomed their first child, a baby boy, on May 13 in Los Angeles, sources told TMZ and Entertainment Tonight. Neither Rihanna nor Rocky has publicly confirmed the birth, and their reps did not respond to HuffPost's requests for comment.  The pair announced they were expecting a child in January, and Rihanna has since redefined pregnancy fashion.   The Savage X Fenty creator wore one of her most memorable looks during Paris Fashion Week in March: a see-through overlay, cape, knee-high boots and a strappy G-string from her own lingerie line.  In the final days of the Barbados National Hero's pregnancy, Rocky dropped a video for his new single, D.M.B. (Dats Mah B**ch), which co-starred Rihanna.   In the video, Rocky proposes to Rihanna with a grill that says 'Marry Me?' and Rihanna responds by baring a grill that says 'I do.' The video ends with the couple tying the knot. (It's unclear if the couple is married in real life.)       Rihanna told Vogue in April that Rocky 'became my family' during a road trip from Los Angeles to New York in the summer of 2020. She described spending time on the road, away from the public eye.   'I cooked our food on this little janky grill I bought from Walmart,' she said. 'I still have it, too. It works like nobody's business.'   She told the outlet that she and Rocky have a lot of fun together.   'I love the simple things, but also the grand adventures. There's no pretentious my-brand-your-brand bullshit, it's just us living,' said said. 'I just feel like I can do any part of life by his side.'   This is a breaking news story and will be updated.

The culture secretary described the news programme as 'edgy' when she was quizzed on the government's proposal to privatise the broadcaster. Dorries told MPs she 'gets on really well' with presenter Cathy Newman and had been asked on by her a number of times in the past two weeks. But, in an apparent reference to reports that former anchor Jon Snow shouted 'F*** the Tories' at Glastonbury Festival, she added: 'I have been on Channel 4 News a number of times. It is edgy.

The broadcaster has been publicly-owned since its creation in 1982 by Margaret Thatcher's government and is entirely funded by advertising. Dorries said she 'can't see a scenario' in which a privately-owned Channel 4 would become partly or wholly subscription-based. Giving evidence to the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee on Thursday, Dorries added: 'As a public service broadcaster that is not on the table, that is just not on the cards at all. I can't see a scenario in which that would happen.' The plans to privatise Channel 4 have come in for severe criticism, including from Conservative MPs. Tory backbencher Sir Peter Bottomley, the longest-serving MP in the Commons, said: 'Channel 4 is in the best state it's been creatively and financially for decades.' He suggested that ministers may have been offended by some of its news coverage - such as replacing Boris Johnson with a melting ice sculpture in a climate change debate - and added that the 'government could do best by leaving it alone'. Damian Green, another former Tory minister, expressed 'profound scepticism' about the government's privatisation plans and said the media industry was united in 'saying Channel 4 isn't broke and doesn't need fixing in this way'. Channel 4 news editor Esme Wren said: 'Channel 4 News is internationally-renowned for the depth and quality of its coverage ranging from the climate crisis to Oscar-nominated doc For Sama to the war in Ukraine. 'Since the start of 2022, C4N has seen the biggest increase in audience share across all the PSB national main news programmes and is up by 43% among younger viewers aged 16-34 year-on-year. 'C4N confirmed its new presenter line-up last month following the departure of Jon Snow, with Krishnan Guru-Murthy, Matt Frei, Cathy Newman and Jackie Long anchoring the programme.

The Italian choreographer and dancer had been a Strictly judge since the show's launch in 2004, but took a two-year break in 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic and his work commitments in the US. For last year's series, long-serving Strictly pro Anton Du Beke took over the seat usually occupied by Bruno, alongside regular judges Craig Revel Horwood, Shirley Ballas and Motsi Mabuse. However, he did take part in the 2022 Strictly tour, judging with Craig and Shirley at shows around the UK. It's now been announced that Bruno will not be back on Strictly when it returns for its landmark 20th series later this year. On Thursday, the BBC confirmed in a press release - which, interestingly, did not mention Bruno's exit - that the judging panel for this year's series would once again consist of Craig, Motsi, Shirley and Anton. Speaking about his return to the panel, Anton said: 'Woohooo! This is BRILLIANT news. Everyone knows how much I absolutely love the show and I'm utterly delighted to be continuing as a regular judge. 'And I get to make the final again - now I know how Giovanni feels!' In the lead-up to the announcement, there had been lots of speculation about whether he would ever be back on Strictly, with both Craig and Shirley suggesting publicly that a five-person panel with both Bruno and Anton could be a potential solution. Earlier this week, it was reported by the Daily Mail that Bruno had made the decision not to resume his usual slot on Strictly. The BBC had no comment when contacted by HuffPost UK about this at the time. Bruno is expected to continue his judging duties on the show's US counterpart Dancing With The Stars, where he sits alongside former Strictly colleague Len Goodman, Derek Hough and Carrie Ann Inaba. He won't be the only familiar face not returning when the new series of Strictly debuts, with fan favourites Oti Mabuse and Aljaz Skorjanec both announcing their exits earlier this year.

The new chief inspector of constabulary, Andy Cooke, told The Guardian on Wednesday: 'I think whenever you see an increase in the cost of living or whenever you see more people dropping into poverty, I think you'll invariable see a rise in crime. 'And that's going to be a challenge for policing to deal with.' Cooke, who is the head of the independent assessor of police forces in England and Wales, continued: 'What they've got to bear in mind is what is the best thing for the community and that individual in the way they deal with those issue. 'And I certainly fully support police officers using their discretion - and they need to use discretion more often.' He said he was not 'giving a carte blanche for people to go out shoplifting', but said he wanted officers to make sure cases were 'dealt with in the best way possible'. The poorest UK households are already expected to experience even higher levels of inflation at 10.9% - compared to 9% for the majority of other households, which is already a 40-year high. Soaring fuel costs and energy bills mean more people are struggling this year, while the Bank of England governor has warned of an 'apocalyptic' rise in food prices on the horizon. However, Cooke, a former chief constable of Merseyside police, was keen to point out that this does not mean people got a free pass for various crimes. He explained: 'There's always individual cases where you can use your discretion that doesn't necessarily result in a prosecution but is dealt with in the best way possible. And the shoplifting one's a good example, isn't it?' This conversation about discretion around food has cropped several times since energy bills and national insurance contributions soared at the beginning of April. Yet, policing minister Kit Malthouse pulled apart Cooke's claim this week. He said this was 'old-fashion thinking' if the police chief really believed the economic problems would increase crime. He told LBC radio on Thursday: 'We first of all believe the law should be blind and police officers should operate without fear or favour in prosecution of the law. 'Secondly it's not quite right to say that as the economy fluctuates so does crime. We've seen economic problems in the past, or not, when crime has risen, or not.' He also said it was 'absolutely right' that ministers make sure police do not ignore shoplifting, explaining: 'In fact I wrote to chief constables just a year or so ago saying they should not be ignoring those seemingly small crimes.' He later told Times Radio: 'It still doesn't mean that we can solve every problem, it's still going to be hard, it's going to be tough for families, and what we have to hope is that this storm of inflation will pass quite quickly.' Concerns about how the UK will cope with access to even the basics - such as heating and eating - are still growing though. MoneySavingExpert's Martin Lewis shared his deep concern that the UK will soon plummet into 'absolute poverty' on Thursday. He said: 'The public mood is desperate, it's angry...if we don't sort this...I worry about civil unrest.'", "b07fc6b798a9fcae3ba884425bb640724f8c21e73d84f8e487bc7c9c": "People always say that having a baby is one of those life experiences that really 'changes' a person -- a total cliche, perhaps, but also a pretty accurate one. This can be especially true when it comes to returning to work after maternity leave. Some mothers find they have to navigate all sorts of new practicalities -- finding childcare, concentrating after nights with little to no sleep, and figuring out finances -- while coping with all kinds of confusing and complex emotions.  Although the pandemic has helped to normalise remote, hybrid, and flexible working to a degree and even led to an increased awareness and transparency about what some mums have to juggle when it comes to having a career and children, it's fair to say that there is still a long way to go. This year, MALTESERS(r) is continuing its support of maternal mental health by raising awareness of what mums may face when they return to work after maternity leave: both the positives and the not-so-positives... Here are some practical tips that have helped real mums on the return to work: 'Don't be hard on yourself; no one is perfect.' Donna, 40, works for the Metropolitan Police in London. After giving birth to twins 4 years ago, she took 18 months' maternity leave, before returning to work for two 10-hour shifts, 2 days a week. 'I was tired, very emotional, and felt insecure due to time off and changes that had happened. I struggled with becoming a mum and how different I felt,' she explains.  Going back to such an intense work environment as a police officer also came with new, unexpected challenges. 'I never used to be scared in my role but all of a sudden, I was frightened of getting hurt and leaving the girls,' she says. What got her through the emotionally tough times was a strong support network that included her wife, mum, her wife's best friend, and her best friend. 'Take the help when offered; get the sleep when you can,' she says. 'There isn't a written rule on how to be the perfect mother.'  'One of the things I suggest people do before going off on maternity leave is to make a list of all the things they like about working / their job / their workplace.'  London-based mum of two Rhiannon works in the public sector and remembers the emotions that came with going back to the office after a year of maternity leave for her first baby and that nursery settling-in period. Thankfully, her workplace has a buddy system which helps parents returning to work feel more at ease, as well as a parent and carers network she's a part of.  'I remember my first day back in the office, a lovely colleague and fellow mum came looking for me at 9am. Without saying anything else, she said, 'You know, you get used to it and sometimes you even enjoy it,' and I was nearly in tears because she was speaking my language and I was so happy to see someone who understood,' she says.  Her top tip for mothers going back to work? Write a letter or make a list reminding yourself of what you enjoy most about your job.  'When you are feeling a little nervous on mat leave, you read this letter and then on the way back in on your first day, you read it again,' she explains.  This list can be useful for all parents (even those who aren't taking a full year of maternity leave) to help remind them of their purpose when away from their little ones, the community they've cultivated in the workplace, or even how much they like the baked goods in the office canteen. Adding career and skills goals to the list can be a good way of seeing what your career priorities were ahead of having your baby and if they've changed.  'I ended up job-sharing with my maternity cover. She specialised in the area I was less familiar with so it worked well for everyone.'  Emily, now a mum of three, was head of marketing at a charity, newly promoted to the role a few months before starting her maternity leave. She and her mat leave cover got along swimmingly and they discovered that their skill sets complemented one another's so well, they could use them to both their advantages. 'The mat leave and I met to discuss it as my boss was reticent at first but said he'd consider it,' explains Emily, adding that her former boss had left a few months before her mat leave so she hadn't worked with the new one before returning to the workplace after her first baby. 'Me and my maternity leave cover came up with a plan together and then presented it to him. She (my job share) specialised in direct marketing and I have a background in above-the-line marketing (TV, radio, press) and brand partnerships, so it worked well. We both ran projects that suited our skill sets independently and so essentially divided the role, and had one day when we were both in to discuss things and share plans.  'We had managers who reported in to us so there was always someone there who was working on the projects. And we could ask each other to oversee things on the days we were off if need be.' One of the reasons Emily felt confident proposing this more flexible-working job share idea is because she'd been hired by the company initially to implement and run a new brand identity for the charity, a task that was more or less completed by the time she'd gone off on maternity leave. She was eager to come back to a new challenge, while still retaining some flexibility. 'Our job share worked really well. We had the odd difference of opinion but on the whole ran separate projects. We both wanted it to work so we made it work,' she says. 'I certainly hadn't recovered emotionally or physically by the time I returned to work but I had the support of a couple of colleagues.' Sarah is a 43-year-old mum based in Sheffield who went back to her teaching role after 9 months of maternity leave. She found that the physical impact of a traumatic birth in which she lost two litres of blood and experienced a fourth-degree tear -- a severe laceration of the perineum caused by childbirth -- was still impacting her life when she went back to work. 'A fourth-degree tear is in many ways harder to recover from both physically and emotionally compared to a caesarean but it's rarely recognised,' Sarah explains. She relied on the help of her colleagues, who would cover for her when she required urgent access to the toilet (teachers are not usually allowed to use the facilities when teaching).  Since her teaching role requires a lot of work outside of school hours (marking, planning, etc.) with no option for work from home, there was a lot of schedule-juggling when she went back to work. Everything felt rushed, like getting from nursery drop-off at 7:30am to school on time and running out of work meetings in the afternoon to make it to pickup for her daughter.  'We had support with childcare on some days I was working but only from one set of grandparents, which was great. But because we had no one else to ask, I struggled to keep on top of the work I needed to do outside my normal working hours, housework, and time for myself or as a couple. And we felt we couldn't ask the grandparents to do more than they were already doing,' she says.  When Sarah first went back to teaching, to make the juggling act of work and early motherhood a bit more feasible, she hired some outside help around the house. 'I negotiated going back to work four days a week, with one day in the office. After a year of maternity leave, I was so excited to go in again, while also having some flexibility.' Sharon took a year of maternity leave from her job as an editor of a website and arranged to go back to work four days a week, with one day in the office. She was excited to return to a job and workplace environment she enjoyed spending time in. 'I used to say that it was so great because at home with your child, if they fall, you're worried and anxious and saying, 'Are you OK? Are you sure you're OK?' At work, if someone trips with some tea, it's more like, 'You alright?' then you turn back to what you were doing. The lack of responsibility was freeing.' Going back to the office one day a week and working the other three days remotely while her daughter went to nursery was the right balance for Sharon, who maintained this schedule for the next year and a bit, before deciding to take on a more freelance, part-time position with the company alongside other writing and editing projects. 'I enjoyed going out to lunch with my colleagues. I love my child but who doesn't want a little break? Going back to work? It was a relief.'

Joao Vale de Almeida mimicked a comment made by Boris Johnson, when he said he wanted to 'fix, not nix' the deal which was previously agreed on trade between Britain and Northern Ireland. The prime minister was speaking as the government announced plans to bring in a new law ripping up the protocol if Brussels refuses to re-negotiate the arrangement. But at a Westminster lunch, de Almeida said: 'It's not very reassuring if you go into a negotiation where you are presented with two options - either renegotiation or unilateral action to override the treaty. 'This is not the best way to fix, this is rather a way maybe to nix. 'So if we want to fix it, which is what we want and I understand this is what the Government wants as well, we need to create a better atmosphere.' The government - as well as Northern Ireland unionists - are unhappy that the protocol has led to customs checks taking place on goods travelling between Great Britain and the province. The row has created a political crisis at Stormont, where the DUP have refused to enter a power-sharing government with Sinn Fein unless the protocol is radically redrawn. Foreign secretary announced on Tuesday that she planned to bring forward legislation within weeks overwriting parts of the post-Brexit deal on Northern Ireland. De Almeida said there was no chance of the EU agreeing to change the 'mandate' it has agreed on how the protocol should be implemented. Instead, he insisted the only solution was for the UK to accept the proposed reforms proposed by Brussels. 'We were told that we should get a new mandate but I can tell you very clearly what the member states are telling us is very simple: You don't need a mandate and even if you ask for one, you will not get it,' he said. On suggestions that the EU could launch a trade war if the UK decides on unilateral action, de Almeida said: 'There is still potential in the proposals that we've made, we would like to focus on that instead of going unilateral. 'Unilateral calls for unilateral. Action calls for reaction. 'And is that what we want, an escalation around Northern Ireland at this present point in time? I don't think so.'", "8cea8c5db3fd2ecf3bbfff206c028af42ec7c84c269455744636e917": "Under-performing leaders of Labour-run councils could be sacked under new party reforms, HuffPost UK has learned. Party hit squads would be sent in to turn around failing Labour groups under the plans. The party's national executive committee has been asked to approve the shake-up amid concerns some local authorities are harming Labour's general election hopes by letting down voters. One party source said: 'We aren't a private members club any more - we are servants of the people.' Under the changes being proposed by Keir Starmer, so-called 'campaign improvement boards' will be sent in to local council Labour groups identified as under-performing. The boards, which will be made up senior party figures with local government experience, will draw up recommendations for improving performance which the Labour groups will then have six months to implement. If the Labour group leaders fail to hit the targets they have been set, party bosses could remove them from their posts. A party source said: 'All Labour council groups must be focused on delivering for voters in their communities, and demonstrating the benefit of Labour in power. 'With the next general election at most two years away, Keir and [Labour general secretary] David Evans are determined that high standards are met at every level of the party, in every region. 'Campaign improvement boards will draw upon the expertise of the best Labour campaigners and officials from across the country, and ensure those local groups that require support implement the changes that are needed to deliver for working people.' It is understood that Croydon Borough Council is one of the local authority Labour groups which have been indentified as under-performing by party bosses. The council effectively declared itself bankrupt in 2020 when it banned all new spending amid a cash crisis. Labour lost control of the council at the local elections earlier this month.

She would have turned 38 on Saturday. 'Please don't say Marnie lost her battle to cancer. It's simply not true,' her husband, Succession actor Zack Robidas, wrote, per Variety. 'I watched her kick cancer's ass everyday since diagnosis. She is incredible. We chose to attack her diagnosis with blind optimism. We only talked about the future and continued moving forward. I don't know if this was right but it's all we knew how to do.' On Mother's Day, Schulenburg posted a photo with her two-year-old daughter Coda and her mother. She lamented being a 'half-life version' of herself for her child, but felt optimistic about her survival prospects. 'My mother showed up 100% all day everyday for me growing up or at least it seemed that way. I want to give Coda the same but I must be kind to myself and remember that nothing is permanent,' Schulenburg wrote. Schulenburg, a native of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, who earned a theatre degree at DeSales University in Pennsylvania, had her first regular role on the soap opera 'As The World Turns' from very late 2006 to the show's cancellation in 2010, according to IMDB. She earned a Daytime Emmy nomination for the final season, which featured Alison getting engaged, Variety noted. She also appeared in nine episodes of the One Life to Live reboot in 2013.

There's nothing like coming home from a long day and snuggling under a duvet. We spend several hours in our beds each day, which is why it's essential to make sure our beds are clean.  For most people, making their bed each morning is part of keeping their bed clean and tidy. But apparently, we shouldn't be making our beds at all. TikTok user @sherifelsahly caught our attention recently by saying we should never ever make our beds in the morning. Our beds attract dust mites and making your bed first thing in the morning will allow them to keep growing, he said. 'But if you keep your bed unmade it exposes the dust mites to light and fresh air which actually helps kill them off,' he added.  And it seems he's onto something. The average adult loses 285ml of fluid each night, according to The Sleep Council.  What this means is that when you make your bed each morning, you are trapping in all of that moisture to fester during the day, ready to be slept on again in the evening. We should actually be pulling back the bed linen to give the mattress the chance to breathe and for moisture to evaporate. This is because moisture can get trapped between the mattress and the linen causing discolouration and potentially odours. Doing this will ensure your mattress lasts longer. They also advise us how we can clean our mattresses.  How to clean a mattress   Don't use a vacuum: it seems tempting to vacuum dust and fluff from your mattress but the powerful suction of a vacuum cleaner can cause the filling to become dislodged which can lead to bumps and dips. Instead use a soft brush to remove the debris onto the floor, which can then be vacuumed.   Blot don't scrub: stains should be immediately tackled by blotting with a clean cloth. If your mattress is filled with natural fibres this should be a dry cloth, 'wet cleaning' could damage the upholstery. Other mattresses may be able to withstand warm soapy water on a rung out clean cloth, but always check the manufacturer's advice before cleaning. Hacks such as bicarbonate of soda and various harsh chemicals are not recommended.   Regularly wash your bedding and mattress protector: wash your bed linen every one to two weeks and your mattress protector once a month. Regularly cleaning these will stop any dirt seeping through the mattress, keeping it cleaner for longer. In the summer, you may have to clean your linen and protector more regularly due to sweat.   Protect to prevent, rather than clean: mattress protectors are like taking out travel insurance on holiday, you hope it isn't needed but will be glad you have it if the worst happens.   Should you flip your mattress and if so, how often? Whether you need to flip your mattress or not is dependent on the type of mattress you have.  Double-sided mattresses can be flipped and should come with the instruction to turn over regularly. For the first three months of having your mattress, it is recommended that you turn it over once a week. After that, turn it over just once a month. This will ensure that the filling is evenly placed and stop dips from forming. Single sided mattresses (such as those with memory foam on top) can not be flipped but should still be rotated 180 degrees. Like with the double-sided mattress, for the first three months it is recommended that you rotate your mattress from head to toe once a week. After that, rotate it just once a month. For natural fibre mattresses, such as those by Vispring, it is recommended that you turn your mattress over twice a week for the first three months and once a season after that. This is to firstly encourage natural and even settlement of the mattress fillings and subsequently to extend its life.  How often should we be changing our bed sheets? Mary Malone, a laundry expert at about.com, previously said that we should be washing our bed sheets regularly. Not washing your bed sheets frequently can lead to a host of health problems such as infected wounds and athletes foot. 'Infrequent cleaning of sheets and pillowcases allows the fluids to seep into the pillows and mattresses, and those are much more difficult to clean than tossing sheets in the washer,' she told ATTN. Allowing dust, sweat and dirt to build-up for just two weeks can be enough to leave you with a scratchy throat or the sniffles, according to New York University microbiologist Philip Tierno. Leaving your bedsheets unchanged can result in sweat and dirt seeping into your pillows and mattress. So how often should we be changing our sheets? The general consensus is that we should all be changing our sheets - including duvet covers and pillow cases - once a week, Tierno says.", "6124abdefed0cefcf781ecfa6bffa8b91cddc6ae4a282b8c849ec68e": "Some refugees fleeing Russia's invasion are being left homeless on the streets of Britain, a Ukrainian MP has warned. On Thursday new government figures revealed 53,800 Ukrainians have so far arrived in the UK. Some 20,800 have come under the family scheme and 33,000 people under the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme. The data shows 107,400 visas have been granted under both schemes, meaning just over half of those with visas granted have arrived. The Homes for Ukraine programme places Ukrainians in the homes of ordinary Brits who volunteer to look after them. Speaking at an event in Westminster via video link, Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko said Ukraine had 'a lot to be grateful for' to the UK. But she warned some people were being left 'homeless because they have been kicked out by the host'. 'OK, it's a normal people-to-people situation,' she said. 'They are all human. Circumstances change. Something went wrong in the relationship. 'But there must be some kind of a backup plan from the UK government. Where do these people go? 'The hosts are not obliged, they have no legal duty to keep the Ukrainian family, there is no responsibility if they kick them out. 'But at the end of the day we have Ukrainian families out on the street, what happens to them?' Richard Harrington, the minister in charge of the Ukraine refugee programme who was also speaking at the event, admitted there was a problem but said it was 'very few cases up to now'. Vasylenko also urged the British government to improve its communications with Ukrainians waiting for their Homes for Ukraine application to be accepted. 'Some people came back to me asking whether it was a real programme or whether it was a scam about which they heard on the internet,' she said. She said the average time it took for someone to get approved was 'two to three weeks', not the three days she had been promised by Priti Patel. Vasylenko added: 'Some people in these three weeks remain in peril, in cities which are under attack like Kharkiv. 'Some people never actually made it in the end to the UK because they got trapped in occupied cities like Kherson or like Mariupol.' 'The government of the UK is doing a lot but could also do a little bit more.'", "03ea5cda60df3238a14aa7b4ced26a5455c4d9be063e2be1ca6a210d": "Love Island season is quickly approaching and for the first time ever islanders will be wearing second-hand clothes, as eBay is now the show's first ever pre-loved fashion partner.  This season, islanders will wear second-hand clothes, with a shared wardrobe situated in the new villa for the first time ever. Viewers will watch contestants show off outfits that will reflect their personality whilst playing their part to extend the life cycle of clothes.  It marks a huge tone shift for the show, considering it previously partnered with I Saw It First and alumni have gone on to be brand ambassadors for the likes of Boohoo, Pretty Little Thing and Asos.  It matters, because Love Island is big business in the world of fashion. Online fashion sales grew by more than a tenth while the reality show ran last summer, research found. The collaboration comes as new research from eBay highlights that UK shoppers are becoming increasingly aware of fast fashion. A fifth (20%) of Brits say they buy more second-hand fashion compared to two years ago and on average, they reckon 16% of their wardrobes are made up of pre-loved clothes. Those aged 18 to 34 have the highest average percentage of second-hand clothes in their wardrobe (22%), nearly double that of over 55s (12%). In the last year, searches for 'pre-loved clothes' have increased significantly, with Gen Z in particular driving the trend, as 80% confirm that they have recently bought second-hand goods. Fashion on Love Island is a big part of the show, which is why fans often look to replicate the looks of their favourite islanders. Last year's winner Millie proved the biggest trendsetter, with her one shoulder marble dress inspiring a 127% rise in searches for 'marble dress' and her hot pink co-ord causing a 114% search spike.  Cassandra Dittmer who is a sustainable stylist, thinks eBay pairing up with Love Island is incredible. 'Any person or platform with influence who promotes shopping more responsibly is a positive move,' Dittmer says.  'Like it or not, Love Island sets trends and causes spikes in shopping after each episode. Setting a trend to get creative with second-hand shopping and encouraging shared wardrobes could be game-changing.' Dittmer believes it's really important for people to see second-hand fashion on TV. 'Seeing this message amplified on TV will highlight this shopping approach to the masses, and also show that buying sustainably doesn't need to blow the budget. Any age, any budget, any size, and any style can all get involved,' she says. She explains that 'the rise of fast (and ultra fast!) fashion in the past decade has flooded our wardrobes, charity shops and sadly landfills all over the world, it's time to tune in to second-hand shopping and move away from thinking of clothing as short-term disposable pieces'.  When asked if she thinks more people are becoming aware of the consequences of fast-fashion, Dittmer says: 'I think it's still hard for people to connect the climate crisis to the shirt on our back. 'But with more and more awareness, education, and huge platforms like Love Island making changes, I think it's only a matter of time before the demand for newness, no matter the cost on people and planet, will be a thing of the past.' Unsurprisingly, the Love Island execs and team at eBay are pretty pumped for the collab.  'We are thrilled to be pairing up with eBay this year as our pre-loved fashion partner. As a show we strive to be a more eco-friendly production with more focus on ways in which we can visibly show this on screen,' Mike Spencer, executive producer of Love Island said.  Jemma Tadd, head of fashion at eBay UK, added: 'We're so excited to partner with Love Island this year and put pre-loved fashion, centre stage.  'The impact of Love Island and its stars across the UK is undeniable and together we want to inspire the nation to choose pre-loved first when shopping - even if this means buying or selling one or two pre-loved items to start with, it's a step in the right direction.'

A new report from the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response, which is part of the World Health Organisation (WHO), casts a damning light on society's response to global disease - and claims it has not changed since Covid broke out in 2019. The panel, set up in July 2020, suggested last year political leadership, financing and surveillance systems needed to be improved. 'One year on and political focus to prepare for more waves is flagging,' the authors behind the report explained. 'Work has begun to prevent the next pandemic but at the current pace, the transformative change required will take years to complete.' What else can we do to prepare? The new findings from the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response found one of the primary obstacles was vaccine inequity. Covid jabs are not being shared around the world equally, and according to the panel, high-income countries can now vaccinate their entire populations twice over with the large supply. For comparison, less than 13% of those in low-income countries are considered fully vaccinated. Without vaccines, the virus will be able to evolve and form new, stronger variants. As the report explained: 'Variants may still emerge that our vaccines cannot manage. 'The more quickly we vaccinate now, the less likelihood there is of ever more variants emerging.' It also called for more therapeutic and diagnostic tests around the world, too. And it's not the first warning we've had The report is an eery echo of the Global Health Security Index's findings from 2021, where it claimed the world was still 'dangerously unprepared' for any future outbreaks.  It also claimed the world was no better prepared in 2021 than it was before Covid emerged, and said even the countries with the best resources to hand - such as the US - still had a shocking number of deaths from the virus. Only last week, former prime minister Gordon Brown (who is also a WHO ambassador on health finance) warned that 'we are sleepwalking into the next variant' and that the world had become 'complacent' about Covid. Will anything trigger change? US President Joe Biden did host a virtual Covid summit in May with other world leaders, meant to revive vaccinations and testing, although the States itself did not pledge any money towards the effort. In its report, the independent panel did acknowledge this - but warned: 'A 'charity' approach is not serving the interests of ending this pandemic or tackling future pandemic threats.' The WHO has also warned there's a $15 billion (PS12 billion) financing gap to get to where we need to be on Covid around the world.", "1d45ccca2bbd7f23505e5913b0cac6ac0c29d093c31dd32467f03257": "The Derry Girls finale delivered everything it needed to and them some, pairing the usual shenanigans with some top tier cameos, quintessential Aunt Sarah, and a bewitching futuristic gadget: the microwave.  But writer Lisa McGee wasn't afraid to get political, either, doing what she does best: telling the story of Northern Ireland's history with relatable people at the heart.  The hour-long special was set around the time of the Good Friday Agreement referendum in 1998, which happened to coincide with Orla's 18th birthday.  We watched as Michelle and Erin debated which way to vote (Michelle longed for her brother to be released from prison, Erin worried about the safety of a mass prisoner release), before Grandpa Joe urged the 'wains' to take a leap of faith for a brighter future: 'What if no one else has to die?' While a quick straw poll around the office reveals some did learn about the Troubles at school, a lot of us did not. And on Twitter, it seems others missed out on this pretty critical history lesson, too.  The final, poignant scene in Derry Girls has been praised for teaching the rest of the UK more about Northern Ireland's history in five minutes than their entire secondary school education.  Why is education about this period of (very recent) history so shocking? It could partly be down to caution - but that's no excuse.  A 2021 report found education about the Troubles isn't even up to scratch in Northern Ireland. The report, titled 'It didn't end in 1998: Examining the Impact of Conflict Legacy Across Generations', found education via school and home varied widely among those born after 1998.  'Children's opportunities to discuss and make sense of the Troubles are limited,' the report said, according to the BBC.   'The potential to glorify or romanticise the past was a key concern where children were not included in discussions about the impact of the Troubles/conflict in communities and families.    'Participants noted that selective or partial accounts may perpetuate sectarian views that can reinforce a divisive mind-set between communities across the generations.'   But following Brexit, it's vital we all get clued up on this stuff. The UK and the EU are once again at loggerheads over the Northern Ireland Protocol. Northern Ireland is technically the only place in the UK with a European border, thanks to its border with the Republic. But understandably, many want to honour the Good Friday Agreement and avoid putting a hard border between the two.  Following the finale, people on social media urged politicians to watch Derry Girls for a 'timely reminder' of their responsibly to act in the best interests of the people.  You'd really hope the people leading these talks already have an in-depth knowledge of Northern Ireland's history. But if Derry Girls can make the rest of wake up to own ignorance - and commit to learning more immediately - that's a pretty good legacy.  A cracker job, some might say.

Earlier this week, it was revealed the love story between Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton) and Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan) will take centre stage in its forthcoming series, instead of going with the continuity of the original Bridgerton novels. In a new interview with Variety, Jess has revealed why it is 'the perfect moment' for the couple to take the lead in the hit Netflix show.   'I really feel like it's Colin and Penelope's time. Because we've been watching both of these actors on our screens since season one, we've already invested in them a little bit. We know who they are as people,' she said. 'I feel like, especially in the last season, there are these moments of tension between them where it's like, Colin walks up to the line of almost realising that Penelope has feelings for him but doesn't quite get there. 'Instead of treading water on that dynamic, we wanted to push it into their season. It really felt like the perfect moment to tee it up.' The third book in the Bridgerton novel series by Julia Quinn focuses on Benedict Bridgerton's romance with Sophie Beckett, and while his story will now be told at a later date on TV, he will still be a 'vital' part of season three.  Jess continued: 'We already differ from the books a little bit because we're an ensemble show. The books really focus on one on one romantic pair at a time and maybe the siblings have a little cameo here and there but they don't have full stories. 'In that way, even though we're reversing the order of the books, I think all the people you would expect to see -- Benedict, who is book three, he will be a vital part of season three.' Colin and Penelope follow in the footsteps of Daphne Bridgerton and Simon Bassett (Phoebe Dynevor and Rege-Jean Page) who took the spotlight during the first run, followed by Anthony Bridgerton and Kate Sharma (Jonathan Bailey and Simone Ashley) in the second.   The third season of Bridgerton will also see one of the Bridgerton family getting a whole new face, as one of the characters has been recast with a new actor.

The Met confirmed this morning that they had now completed their investigation into lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street and Whitehall.  A total of 126 fixed penalty notices for breaches of Covid-19 regulations have been handed out relating to eight parties over a 10 month period in 2020 and 2021, the Met said. Asked if the PM had received any more FPNs, his spokesman said: 'No, and the Met has confirmed they are taking no further action with regard to the prime minister.' Carrie Johnson has also been informed that she will receive no more fines, the spokesman said. Cabinet Secretary Simon Case has not received any fixed penalty notices, he added. In a statement this morning, Helen Ball, Acting Deputy Commissioner of the Met, said: 'There is no doubt that the pandemic impacted all of us in so many ways and strong feelings and opinions have been expressed on this particular issue. 'When Covid regulations were introduced, the Met was clear that whilst we would not routinely investigate breaches of regulations retrospectively, there may be occasions when it would be appropriate to do so.

In its latest Twitter update, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) claimed that Moscow's centralised command is only going to come under more pressure as it tries to re-establish control behind the scenes. The MoD explained that Russia, 'has fired senior commanders who are considered to have performed poorly during the opening stages of its invasion of Ukraine'. Who has been fired? This includes Lieutenant General Serhiy Kisel who commanded the elite 1st Guards Tank Army has been suspended after he was unable to capture Ukraine's second-largest city Kharkiv. Ukrainian resistance 'appear to have won the battle of Kharkiv' according to the US think tank, Institute for the Study of War, after Russian units were unable to hold their lines around the city. Russia has been bombarding the city since the war began three months ago, but the troops were not able to even encircle Kharkiv and were subsequently expelled. The commander behind Russia's Black Sea Fleet, Vice Admiral Igor Osipov, is also likely to have been suspended after the cruiser Moskva sank in April. It was Russia's flagship Black Sea missile cruiser which was struck down by two Ukrainian missiles, a huge symbolic and military blow to the Kremlin at a time when it was already losing morale. The UK officials also think that Russian chief of the General Staff Valeriy Gerasimov is still in post, 'but it is unclear whether he retains the confidence of President Putin'. What does that mean for the war? Without a clear command system, the Russian forces - already said to be disorganised and lacking supplies - are unlikely to secure any victories in Ukraine any time soon. As the MoD summarised: 'A culture of cover-ups and scape-goating is probably prevalent within the Russian military and security system. 'Many officials involved in the invasion of Ukraine will likely be increasingly distracted by efforts to avoid personal culpability for Russia's operational set-backs. 'This will likely place further strain on Russia's centralised model of command and control, as officers increasingly seek to defer key decisions to their superiors.  'It will be difficult for Russia to regain the initiative under these conditions.' Russia was already struggling There seems to be a major problem with top military officials within the Russian forces right now. Ukraine's ministry of defence claimed earlier this month that US intelligence has helped it to find and kill 12 Russian generals since the war began. Neither Russia nor the States have confirmed this number, although the US's National Security Council later claimed that it was providing 'battlefield intelligence' to Ukraine, and did not have intent 'to kill Russian generals'. While the details of this claim remain unclear, this is just one of many signs that central control is falling apart in Russia.  President Vladimir Putin is also said to have taken over the day-to-day management of the war, despite such tasks typically falling to more junior commanders. 'We think Putin and Gerasimov are involved in tactical decision-making at a level we would normally expect to be taken by a colonel or a brigadier,' a Western military source said, according to the Guardian. Yohann Michel, defence and military research analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told the i newspaper: 'If you're trying to be both general and captain, you are usually doing neither and you are creating uncertainty at every level of the chain of command.' He added: 'The Russian armed forces don't need to have this level of micro-management from the top who have problems of their own.' Russia's war effort is going so badly even a retired colonel broke rank on state TV and admitted: 'Sometimes information is being spread about some sort of psychological breakdown in Ukraine's Armed Forces, suggesting some sort of a breakthrough is imminent.

Meanwhile, Oscar winner Viola Davis was also snapped at the screening in one of the brightly-coloured gowns she's become synonymous with in recent years. The glamour continued elsewhere in Cannes, where Kylie Minogue revealed on social media she'd recently touched down as part of an advertising campaign with Magnum ice lollies. And a certain British boyband also struck a pose for photographers ahead of unveiling their new film Greatest Days, which centres on an original story inspired by their success. The 75th Cannes Film Festival kicked off on Monday with the debut of Final Cut, with more films like Armagaeddon Time and Baz Lurhmann's much-anticipated Elvis biopic to be screened in the coming days.

In a statement, the force announced that the partygate probe, known as Operation Hillman, 'is now complete'. A total of 126 fixed penalty notices for breaches of Covid-19 regulations have been handed out relating to eight parties, the Met said. Of those, 53 were men and 73 were women. They included fines for Boris Johnson, his wife Carrie and chancellor Rishi Sunak, for attending a surprise 56th birthday party for the prime minister in the Cabinet Room in June, 2020. Downing Street sources said the prime minister has not received any other fines 'at this stage'. Helen Ball, Acting Deputy Commissioner of the Met said: 'There is no doubt that the pandemic impacted all of us in so many ways and strong feelings and opinions have been expressed on this particular issue. 'When Covid regulations were introduced, the Met was clear that whilst we would not routinely investigate breaches of regulations retrospectively, there may be occasions when it would be appropriate to do so. 'The information that we received with regard to the alleged breaches in Downing Street and Whitehall was sufficient to reach our criteria to begin such an investigation. 'Our investigation was thorough and impartial and was completed as quickly as we could, given the amount of information that needed to be reviewed and the importance of ensuring that we had strong evidence for each FPN referral. 'This investigation is now complete.' The announcement paves the way for Sue Gray to finally publish her full report into the scandal. The Met said a team of twelve detectives were involved in the partygate probe, the total cost of which was PS460,000. They worked through 345 documents, including emails, door logs, diary entries and witness statements, 510 photographs and CCTV images and issued 204 questionnaires. The partygate scandal led to dozens of Tory MPs submitting letters of no confidence in Johnson's leadership, with many also publicly calling on him to quit. It was widely speculated that the PM - who attended up to six of the parties under investigation - was likely to receive more fines. However, if no further FPNs are handed down, it will represent a huge boost to his chances of political survival. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said: 'Industrial scale rule breaking has taken place at the heart of Boris Johnson's Downing Street. 'We must now urgently see the Sue Gray report published in full. It's time for the Prime Minister to stop hiding. 'While the British people sacrificed so much, Boris Johnson's Downing Street broke the rules at record-breaking scale. Britain deserves better.' Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said Sue Gray must publish her report 'without delay'. He said: 'This police investigation confirms Boris Johnson's Downing Street was fined more times for breaking Covid laws than any other address in the country. It exposes a shocking level of criminality at the heart of Johnson's Number 10.  'It beggars belief that Conservative MPs are allowing our great country to be run by a prime minister who broke the law then repeatedly lied about it. 'The full Sue Gray report should now be published without delay, and the parliamentary inquiry should be launched into Johnson's lies.  'The public made huge sacrifices while Boris Johnson partied, they deserve the full truth.'", "507d837939d2fad8b49bedc6ee5d00fdeb536bf259246cb88c8c2181": "With Love Island still holding out on making an LGBTQ+ version of the show, BBC Three has announced details of its own new gay dating series - and it's set to be hosted by a pop icon.  Dannii Minogue is set to front I Kissed A Boy, which will see ten single men head to Europe to find their Mr Right.  However, in a twist on the dating show format, it all begins with a kiss, as before they arrive, they will be paired up with their strongest match who they immediately kiss upon meeting. Details about the show promise 'preconceptions will be challenged and dramatic decisions made' as we find out whose spark will ignite, whose eyes might wander, and who will end up together. Dannii said of hosting the show: 'There are millions of people in the UK looking for love. And I believe love is for everyone. So I am so thrilled for a gay dating show to be entering the sea of other dating shows that have existed on TV for years. 'I have been a staunch ally of the LGBTQ+ community for as long as I can remember. My close friends know that my dream job title would be 'Cupid' - so this gives me that flutter-of-love feeling inside too, just to be a part of it. Let's hope there is love, sealed with a kiss!' Fiona Campbell, Controller, BBC Three, added: 'I Kissed a Boy is a brilliant new show in the dating space that we think has huge potential for BBC Three. 'We hope our audience will love the heady mix of drama and heart-warming romance that we know the series will bring.' Further details about I Kissed A Boy will be announced in due course.

One woman had her ovaries removed by mistake even though the plan was to conserve them. Whilst six patients had injections to the wrong eye. Some 407 'Never Events' - things so serious they should never happen - were recorded in the NHS in England from April 2021 until March 2022, figures examined by the PA news agency show. This is the equivalent of nearly eight every week and is an increase from the same period the year before, which had 364 in total. Overall, there were 98 cases of a foreign object being left inside a patient after a procedure. Vaginal swabs were left in patients 32 times and surgical swabs were left 21 times. Some of the other objects left inside patients included part of a pair of wire cutters, part of a scalpel blade, and the bolt from surgical forceps. On three separate occasions over the year, part of a drill bit was left inside a patient. Overall, there were 171 cases of wrong site surgery. The wrong hip implant was undergone 12 times, a wrong knee implant was done 11 times, and patients were connected to air instead of oxygen 13 times. The wrong blood was transfused for seven people and one patient had a procedure to their breast that they had not consented to. Never Events are defined by the NHS as 'serious, largely preventable patient safety incidents that should not occur if healthcare providers have implemented existing national guidance or safety recommendations'. These figures are provisional as a further 29 cases occurred that fall under the 'Serious Incidents' category that do not yet fit the definition of a Never Event, but are under local investigation. The data also showed that patients were administered an overdose of the immunosuppressant Methotrexate twice, and an overdose of insulin was administered 11 times. Additionally, the data highlights the difference in the reporting of errors between NHS trusts, with Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust reporting the highest number of 11 in total. Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust and Sandwell and West Birmingham University Hospitals NHS Trust both reported 10 in total, followed by Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, and Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, who all reported nine each. An NHS spokesperson said: 'While these events are extremely rare, and NHS staff are working hard to provide safe care to patients, it is important that events are reported and learned from so that they can be prevented in the future.' A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: 'Patient safety is a top priority for the Government and these unfortunate events - although very rare - can have a serious physical and psychological impact on patients. 'We are implementing the NHS Patient Safety Strategy which is designed to support staff to provide safe care and learn lessons. 'There are record numbers of nurses, doctors and overall staff working in the NHS, and we have set out our plan to tackle the Covid backlog, backed by record investment.'", "6c87a943d839839b51037cbf13e748e1fd1b8181451b86460e4968fa": "Behold, a mechanical tongue. This life-like organ, which even drools, is the (ahem) handiwork of one Tobias Bradford, a Swedish artist based in London. If you're wondering where this rather stimulating bit of art can be viewed, it's on display at the Design Museum in London, as part of its current exhibition on ASMR - or 'autonomous sensory meridian response' for the uninitiated (you only need go to YouTube to experience thousands of ASMR videos yourself). Despite Bradford's serious and important contribution to science and art with his new contraption, horny TikTokkers who have happened upon the tongue while visiting the show can only think of one thing. And they're probably not alone (I mean, there's spit involved and everything). Named Immeasurable Thirst/Thirst Feeling, the disturbingly realistic wet rubber tongue - which moves up and down through a robotic system created by Bradford - can be found towards the back of the museum. Just don't all try to take it home. TikTok creator Anushka Chadha first posted it to her channel after visiting the Design Museum with a friend. To a soundtrack of Slipping Through My Fingers from Mamma Mia, she wrote, mouth agape in the video: 'the girls were too stunned to speak'. But other viewers were not - commenting on their hundreds on how much they wouldn't mind a device of their own. 'Drop the link', one wrote, while someone else asked: 'Is this on Amazon?' Others joked: 'I must be broken because this gave me butterflies'. And one women inevitably retorted: 'Does this come with different speeds?' You might be wondering why the tongue was made and what it's doing at the Design Museum. Well, the exhibition - suitably entitled WEIRD SENSATION FEELS GOOD (and the largest on ASMR to date) - was put together in collaboration with the ArkDes centre in Stockholm, Sweden. The show's curators and featured artists want people to come and see the displays to experience their effect on the body and mind (just like ASMR). 'The world of ASMR is a community, a culture, and a creative field,' said the show's curator, James Taylor-Foster. 'In this sense, it's a real site of imagination within an emergent field that acknowledges the internet as a territory for design.' And Bradford's inspiration for developing the disembodied tongue? More existential than you might expect.  He wrote on his website: 'An object which appears to act on its own interest carries many suggestions regarding free will and the 'self' in a philosophical sense, and the friction between rational thought and one's emotional experience of the world can be intensified when in a situation with conflicting sensory information.' 'Similarly to how a word can become absurd when uttered repeatedly, an action or a moment which is stuck in a loop can reveal some of the strangeness of everyday life.' Deep. We'd ask him to go on, but... WEIRD SENSATION FEELS GOOD: The World Of ASMR is at the Design Museum, London until 16 October 2022.", "cd74a9b34812458d61733f644e6ebcf7049404e1e59c7d1c1b688811": "Rupert Everett has said he does not think gay roles need to be played exclusively by gay actors. Speaking on Piers Morgan Uncensored, the British actor argued that all roles should be open to all sexualities.  'I don't think gay actors should just play the gay roles,' he said. 'I think that the gay actors should be able to play the straight roles too. I think some straight guys played great gay roles.' The 62-year-old star, who first found fame playing a gay public school pupil in 1984 drama Another Country, has spoken out about gay rights and previously said he believed coming out harmed his Hollywood career. 'I think the question is more 'Why can't gay actors play straight roles?... We shouldn't be making rules about this,' he continued. 'Yes, of course, it's great for gay actors who've had quite a hard time, you know historically, to be playing more roles to be getting the game.' The My Best Friend's Wedding actor praised performances by Michael Douglas and Matt Damon in Behind The Candelabra and applauded Tom Hanks in Philadelphia.   He added: 'It's quite frustrating. I was frustrated, I remember going to see Colin Firth in the film by Tom Ford. I thought, 'Well, thanks, Colin, that's the end of my career'. Because you know, that role really should have been mine. So you know, there's a frustration about that, of course.' It's A Sin creator Russell T Davies has previously said he believes gay roles should be played by gay actors. The writer and showrunner, who also worked on Queer As Folk, Doctor Who and A Very English Scandal, said 'it's about authenticity' when discussing the ongoing debate. 'I'm not being woke about this... but I feel strongly that if I cast someone in a story, I am casting them to act as a lover, or an enemy, or someone on drugs or a criminal or a saint... they are not there to 'act gay' because 'acting gay' is a bunch of codes for a performance,' Russell told Radio Times. 'It's about authenticity, the taste of 2020. You wouldn't cast someone able-bodied and put them in a wheelchair, you wouldn't Black someone up. Authenticity is leading us to joyous places.' Last year, US actor Neil Patrick Harris, who starred in It's A Sin and came out publicly in 2006, was asked if he agreed with Russell's comments about only wanting to cast gay actors in gay roles. 'I'm not one to jump on to labelling,' he told The Times. 'As an actor you certainly hope you can be a visible option for all kinds of different roles. 'I played a character [in How I Met Your Mother] for nine years who was nothing like me,' he continued, noting that he believes it's important 'to hire the best actor' for the part. Speaking of his own desire to play both gay and straight roles in the future, he added, 'In our world that we live in, you can't really as a director demand that [an actor be gay or straight]. Who's to determine how gay someone is?'

The former US president, who was in the White House between 2001 and 2009, ordered the invasion of Iraq almost 20 years ago. His administration justified the invasion by claiming there were weapons of mass destructions in the country, but inspectors from the UN later confirmed there was no evidence weapons of the kind existed prior to the invasion. Bush has been heavily criticised for it ever since. It was therefore a rather unfortunate slip of the tongue when Bush, discussing Russia's unprovoked attack on Ukraine, accidentally made a reference to Iraq. 'Russian elections are rigged,' Bush said in a clip which rapidly went viral. 'Political opponents are imprisoned or otherwise eliminated from participating in the electoral process. 'The result is an absent of checks and balances in Russia, and the decision of one man to launch a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion of Iraq. 'I mean, of Ukraine.' According to some viewers, he then muttered under his breath: 'Iraq, too.' Amid laughter from the audience, Bush resumed and made a reference to his age to explain his error: 'Anyway - 75...' And it wasn't long before the Twitter reactions started to roll in.", "c90d003901611dfdc0c75bd2e442f31443ec528fe1cdecb8a97dcb3c": "On May 14, an 18-year-old gunman entered a supermarket in a predominantly Black neighborhood in Buffalo, New York and fatally shot 10 people. The accused, Payton Gendron, livestreamed the attack on Twitch. Gendron is a self-described white supremacist who posted a 180-page manifesto online espousing racist conspiracy theories including the 'great replacement theory,' which maintains that people of color are working to replace white Americans through immigration, interracial marriage and eventually violence.  A preliminary investigation of Gendron's internet history found that he had viewed white supremacist and racist content and studied violent events like the 2019 mosque shootings in Christchurch, New Zealand.  This act of extremist violence from a teenager highlights a terrifying issue that impacts families and communities: the radicalization of young people online.  'The sad reality is that if teens are online, they are being exposed to white supremacist content,' Dana Coester, an associate professor at West Virginia University's Reed College of Media who has researched digital extremism, tells HuffPost. 'While there is a lot of public awareness in the aftermath of mass shootings of platforms such as 4chan, 8chan, Gab and others, this content is on popular platforms for youth and teens, such as Instagram, Tiktok, Steam, and Discord, and within games.' In her research, Coester has observed middle-school-age children consuming memes with a mix of 'shame-inducing violent, pornographic, gore, misogynistic, anti-Semitic, anti-Muslim and racist content.'  'This content is often portrayed as jokes, and is combined with benign and even wholesome content, which works to desensitise youth to traumatic content, and to create feelings of shame and isolation, which can make them more susceptible for manipulation,' she notes.  Coester's research has also shown that a teen does not have to be seeking out extremist content to encounter it.  'As a mom of teenage boys, I've noticed that they appear to be the target of campaigns to push their ideology further from inclusion and diversity,' says writer and media critic Joanna Schroeder. 'These campaigns come in forms that are quite formal, like YouTube ads and paid, sponsored content on social media, to more subtle propaganda like commentary by YouTubers and TikTok accounts the kids already follow and streamers who add commentary into their live video game play.' She notes that YouTube's algorithm and autoplay function have been found to push young people 'toward biased and politicised content, even when they start on innocuous gaming videos.' The isolation of the past two years has exacerbated the issue, as teens have increasingly turned to the internet for connection.  'Thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic, teens have been spending more and more time online than ever before,' says Brian Hughes, associate director of the Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab (PERIL) at American University. 'That time was often unsupervised, so they were more likely to encounter this kind of propaganda and recruitment - and when they encountered it, were more likely to not have someone on hand to say, 'Hey, hold on, this looks like it's trying to manipulate you.''  Although online radicalisation is a complex and systemic issue, there are steps parents and caregivers can take to help combat budding extremism. Below, experts share their advice for what to do if you suspect your teen is getting radicalised online. Pay attention to your teen's online consumption 'As a parent myself, I often tell my friends to listen in on what the kids are watching on YouTube, ask what the people they follow are talking about, and ask if they've learned anything online,' Schroeder says. 'Often, our kids will surprise us with wonderful things they've learned, but we may also discover that they've been fed misinformation or even disinformation and believe it simply because they've never heard anyone challenge it.' Pay attention if you noticed your child laughing at or sharing memes with politically charged messages or extremist tropes and vocabulary.  'It's very easy to accidentally encounter hateful messages online,' says Adrienne van der Valk, senior fellow at the community organising group Western States Center (WSC). 'Young people may not have the digital literacy skills to know what they're seeing and might be repeating those ideas.' She emphasised that hearing these messages repeated doesn't always mean your teen has fully absorbed or understood them, but it's a good opportunity to intervene and start a conversation about what they're consuming.  Take note of new joke patterns 'Kids that are watching a lot of 'edgy' streamers, YouTubers and other social media personalities might push the boundaries of propriety at home, consciously or subconsciously mimicking the tone of these 'edgelords,'' Schroeder says. Pay attention if your teen is sharing new jokes and memes that are out of character or outside the culture of humour in your family. Humour is often a tactic of extremist groups to cultivate a following. In 2017, a leaked style guide from the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer highlighted the white supremacist organisation's strategy: 'Packing our message inside of existing cultural memes and humour can be viewed as a delivery method. Something like adding cherry flavour to children's medicine.' While humour sometimes involves plausible deniability ('I was just kidding!'), try to disrupt the idea that jokes pushing racist and white supremacist ideologies don't have real-world consequences. Ask your teen how they think that joke would sound to a friend who belongs to the group referenced. 'As a mom, if I heard this, I would take the opportunity to talk to my kids about how humour can be edgy without hurting anyone else - and that saying 'it's just a joke' doesn't undo the harm done when a person or individuals who are targeted,' Schroeder says. 'Often, these 'just a joke' jokes are ways to normalise harmful ideologies.' Look out for behavioural changes 'Parents should be looking for their teens changing their individual behaviour, feeling disengaged, disinterested in activities they enjoyed before or expressing grievances or ideologies that are new to their conversations,' advises Amra Sabic-El-Rayess, an associate professor at Columbia University's Teachers College who researches radicalisation. 'Parents might also see this culminate into their teens potentially withdrawing completely from expressing their views or engaging within school, local community and even with their own family members.' She added that radicalisation might manifest as teens struggling in school, cutting ties with old friends, spending extra hours online and displaying anger toward adults and peers. Listen to the views they espouse 'While there isn't a 'profile' for these types of situations, there are signs that, when intercepted, can be the difference between them falling deeper into the ideology and bringing them back to a positive space,' says Kesa White, a program research assistant at PERIL. She noted that potential signs can include discussing extremist beliefs, frequenting websites affiliated with harmful rhetoric or even former acts of extremist violence, harming animals, or using racial slurs and other hateful language.  'A big red flag is expressing beliefs aligned with the idea of the 'great replacement' or 'white genocide,'' Hughes says. 'Certain conspiracy theories, talking points, memes and cultural icons are perennial red flags, so pay attention to what your teen is becoming interested in.' Don't ignore any rhetoric that blames or scapegoats groups to which your teen doesn't belong for events or political developments they don't support. Other red flags include expressing strong loyalty to a certain figure online, showing a stringent new interest in politics or specific political beliefs that seem out of left field, or supporting and spreading anti-democratic groups and conspiracy theories. Talk to other people in your teen's life 'To the extent someone is able, try to talk to others in the youth's life,' says David Jones, the manager of applied research at the Organization for the Prevention of Violence. 'A teacher, coach, student counsellor, etc. is a good idea as they may have also noticed changes in the youth's personality or may be able to explain the root of these sudden changes. Trying to build a supportive network around the youth where everyone is on the same page with trying to help is a really good starting place.' Ask other influential adults in your child's life - whether it's a coach, uncle, cousin or spiritual leader - if they've noticed anything concerning. 'You can ask them to pay extra attention to your teen and help increase their sense of connection and belonging,' van der Valk suggests. 'This can be tricky because you don't want your young person to think you're going behind their back. But it can be a strategy to discreetly ask, 'Can you check on them?'' Don't shame them 'As a parent, it can be hard not to be angry, disgusted or even triggered by your child showing signs of having been exposed to this type of content, but it's important to take a deep breath and to try to talk to your child with respect,' Shroeder says. As you process your feelings and think about what you might want to say, turn to online resources. In 2020, PERIL and the Southern Poverty Law Center teamed up to put together a free guide called Building Resilience & Confronting Risk: A Parents And Caregivers Guide to Online Radicalization. WSC also has a free resource for parents and caregivers called Confronting Conspiracy Theories and Organized Bigotry at Home. Then, when you address the issue with your teen, be mindful of your tone and general approach. 'If you see something that seems strange, ask about it,' Hughes advises. 'Don't come at it from a position of condemning, scolding or ridiculing. Those approaches tend to cause people, particularly teenagers, to dig in their heels, so it could backfire and make things worse.' Foster open dialogue 'One of the most important things that parents can do is just to be curious and foster an environment in your home where everyone feels safe engaging in open discussion - even, and perhaps especially - about controversial or very political topics,' Jones says. 'Ultimately, a youth sharing their exploration of a radical or potentially dangerous ideology with a parent or caregiver is an indication that they trust the person and are open to discussing the new ideas they're exploring.' He noted that this opening can form the basis of constructive conversations. So, when you're addressing your concerns about radicalisation, do what you can to keep this line of communication open.  When you see a meme or hear a piece of information that is troubling, use a neutral tone to ask things like: What does that mean? Where did it come from? Who shared it? Why do you think they wanted to share it? What do you think makes this funny? Who do you think would dislike it? Who do you think might be hurt by it? 'It's tempting to just shut it down and say, 'Well, we don't say that in this house,'' van der Valk says. 'But if a conversation is shut down harshly, it drastically diminishes the opportunity to maintain an influential connection with that young person.' Instead, she advises casting yourself as someone who will be consistently available to talk about beliefs. Of course, you don't have to agree or tell them that something offensive is OK.  'But this affords the best opportunity to help them see things as they are and to bring them back to your family's values when they later realise down the road that these groups or ideas didn't deliver what was promised or are proven to be false or misleading,' van der Valk explains.  Try to figure out the root cause Keeping the lines of communication open not only maintains your status as a person of trust, but it can also help you understand and tackle why your teen is wading into radicalisation.  'If you can approach all of it with calm, loving interest, you can try to identify the need your child has that is being fulfilled by these sources online,' Shroeder says. 'Do they believe they aren't being told the 'truth' from their parents, teachers and the media their parents consume? Are they feeling lonely and the community they've found online (even if harmful) makes them feel less alone?' She also noted that there can be a heroism aspect to their connection with extremist ideologies.  'I think there is a strong desire within teens, especially teen boys, to be heroes, and I think a lot of these anti-democracy propagandists feed into that,' Shroeder says. 'They make them feel like diversity and inclusion are harming people (often using kids and white women as examples of who is supposedly being harmed) and convince them that resisting efforts to make the world safer and more inclusive for all people is the heroic thing to do.' Build critical thinking skills. 'Most of the time, the kids I've seen pulled into these dangerous ways of thinking are bright and interested in the world, and they simply don't feel they have anyone to talk to about the world whom they trust,' Shroeder says. 'They haven't been given critical thinking skills or media analysis tools. We need to practice this stuff with our kids starting when they are small, but it's not too late with teens.' Teaching media literacy helps young people learn to assess sources, motivations and points of view. It's also important to expose your kids to diverse stories and perspectives throughout their lives. 'Discuss those stories with them so that your child can critically think and question what an extremist group might curate for them,' Sabic-El-Rayess recommended. 'For many it is transformative as they become self-aware and understand they can connect with someone different from them. It helps them act differently and approach others with curiosity not hate.' Equipping young people with critical thinking skills and experiences helps them become informed consumers as they inevitably face propaganda and misinformation.  'There are plenty of young people engaging with extremist-adjacent content who will never become violent, or who will engage and ultimately reject it or move on to help combat it,' Coester says. 'That's what we try and foster. Help young people understand how they're manipulated and move them toward peer-to-peer disruption of those paths.' Reach out for help 'When in doubt, reach out to a trusted mental health professional for help in talking calmly to your child about these issues,' Schroeder advises. Although mental health counsellors can be a good resource, keep in mind that they may not be trained to specifically deal with extremism.  'If someone in your life -- young or old -- starts to become intensely focused on an ideology or some form of conspiracy theory, and starts to reorder their life around this new belief system, severs social ties, and talks about violence being acceptable, it is worth considering reaching out some form of specialised support,' Jones advised.  There are many organisations and programs involved in de-radicalisation. Hughes recommended contacting Hope Not Hate and Parents for Peace for guidance if you think your teen is being radicalised.  'While PERIL advocates for noncarceral solutions, if someone suspects the teen is on the verge of violence or discusses 'hypothetical' violence, law enforcement should be contacted immediately,'' White adds.  Remember that radicalisation is a complex, systemic issue that can't be fully combated in isolation. It impacts communities, as well as individual families.  'Organise with other parents, teachers, faith leaders, health professionals and community members to combat this and to fully recognise it for the battle for a generation that it is,' Coester says.", "c96e7ce296fb061cd2be0d65f034c01698feb3ab2138d367d425f7fa": "Welcome to New York ... University's commencement speaker, Taylor Swift.  The 32-year-old singer-songwriter delivered a heartwarming speech for NYU's graduating classes during the 2022 ceremony on Wednesday, where she also received an honorary doctor of fine arts degree.  'Last time I was in a stadium this size, I was dancing in heels and wearing a glittery leotard. This outfit is much more comfortable,' she joked in her opening remarks while dressed in the school's violet graduation attire. 'I am 90% sure I am here because I have a song called 22.' Before she took the stage at Yankee Stadium, Taylor shared a peek of her preparation for the day on Instagram, writing alongside a video, 'Wearing a cap and gown for the very first time - see you soon NYU.' Given Taylor's breakout success as a teenager, she never went to college or completed high school in a traditional sense, as she was homeschooled for both her junior and senior years. In her speech, the chart-topping star expressed gratitude to the 'patchwork quilt of those who have loved us, those who have believed in our futures'. including her own family for their support and sacrifices over the years. Despite recognising that she is in no way 'qualified to tell you what to do,' the music superstar went on to offer the crowd various 'life hacks,' including some lessons from her ups and downs in the music industry. 'Learn to live alongside cringe. No matter how hard you try to avoid being cringe, you will look back on your life and cringe retrospectively,' she said before poking fun at how she 'dressed like a 1950s housewife' for the entirety of 2012. 'Cringe is unavoidable over a lifetime. Even the term 'cringe' might someday be deemed 'cringe.'' Taylor then encouraged the graduates to embrace, not avoid the obstacles that inevitably lie ahead, as she's found that 'mistakes led to the best things in my life'. 'Having journalists write in-depth, oftentimes critical, pieces about who they perceive me to be made me feel like I was living in some weird simulation, but it also made me look inward to learn about who I actually am,' she said. 'Having the world treat my love life like a spectator sport in which I lose every single game was not a great way to date in my teens and 20s, but it taught me to protect my private life fiercely.' Seemingly making reference to the backlash she received due to her years-long feud with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, she continued, 'Being publicly humiliated over and over again at a young age was excruciatingly painful, but it forced me to devalue the ridiculous notion of minute-by-minute, ever-fluctuating social relevance and likability. 'Getting cancelled on the internet and nearly losing my career gave me an excellent knowledge of all the types of wine.' Taylor concluded her speech by offering some final words of encouragement, while also joking about her honorary doctorate. 'We are led by our gut instincts, our intuition, our desires and fears, our scars and our dreams. And you will screw it up sometimes. So will I,' she said. 'And when I do, you will most likely read about it on the internet.  'As long as we are fortunate enough to be breathing, we will breathe in, breathe through, breathe deep, breathe out. And I'm a doctor now, so I know how breathing works.' Taylor's songwriting and evolution as an artist were the focus of a class that Rolling Stone reporter Brittany Spanos taught this year at NYU's Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music. In the press release announcing Taylor as the school's commencement speaker, the university hailed her as 'one of the most prolific and celebrated artists of her generation' and the only female artist in history to win the music industry's highest honour, the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, three times.'", "16bae72dadd8905a8c831c979085d4863d8b34671d20fd71e0f0787f": "Derry Girls aired its final episode on Wednesday night, and managed to pack in some seriously impressive cameos to mark the hit sitcom's last outing. While the season three finale aired earlier this week, Derry Girls' last ever episode was a stand-alone special set around the time of the Good Friday Agreement vote, which happened to coincide with Orla's 18th birthday. Towards the end of the show, viewers said an emotional goodbye to the cast as they were seen voting in favour of the agreement. Following his cameo earlier in the series, Liam Neeson's character was also seen casting his vote as he returned for a silent appearance that viewers on Twitter found particularly moving: Fans were then treated to an even more unexpected scene in the middle of the closing credits, featuring none other than Bill and Hillary Clinton's daughter Chelsea. As Derry Girls devotees might recall, the gang wrote to Chelsea during season two in a moment set during the Clintons' 1995 visit to Northern Ireland. While they never received a reply, a scene set in present-day New York showed the writer and global health advocate receiving a hand-written letter that was apparently 'intercepted while on its way to the White House in the 1990s' She then read out the note from the Derry Girls asking if she would like to 'hang out' with them when she arrives in Northern Ireland with her parents. 'If they're anything like our parents, well, you'll be bored out of your tree,' the note said. Speaking about her surprise appearance, Chelsea Clinton said: 'Thanks to Lisa McGee's incredible talent, and that of the wonderful cast and crew of Derry Girls, people around the world have been able to better understand and relate to a hugely significant and important period of history in Northern Ireland and for the world. 'Like many, I am a big fan of the series, and I was honoured to be able to appear in the very special final episode. I hope people enjoy watching it as much as I enjoyed being a part of it.' Suffice to say, Chelsea's appearance in the show left fans suitably stunned: Set in 1998 - in the week of the referendum on the Good Friday Agreement, which set out a peace accord for the troubled factions in Northern Ireland - the last episode of Derry Girls explored the real-life tensions of the time while offering light relief as Erin and Orla attempt to throw a joint 18th birthday party. The group also faced tension as Erin and Michelle have an argument about the peace agreement as Erin feels it is not right that paramilitary prisoners could be released as part of the conditions while Michelle reminds her that her brother is in jail for such a crime. As the episode drew to a close, Erin reflected on the importance of growing up and moving on. The message became particularly poignant for the end of the comedy series and the historical moment as she speaks over video footage of The Troubles and discussions had by key political characters. She said: 'It's good, it's exciting and maybe a wee bit scary too. There's a part of me that wishes that everything could just stay the same. That we could all just stay like this forever. There's a part of me that doesn't really want to grow up. I'm not sure if I'm ready for it. I'm not sure I'm ready for the world. But things can't stay the same and they shouldn't. 'No matter how scary it is, we have to move on. And we have to grow up because things might just change for the better. So we have to be brave. And if our dreams get broken along the way, we have to make new ones from the pieces.' The characters have their final moments together in the polling station as they vote in favour of the peace agreement. As they walk out together, a voiceover by a news presenter says 'Yes - 71.12%. A record-breaking turnout and an overwhelming majority. 'The people of Northern Ireland have spoken. The country has just taken its first step into the future.' Derry Girls is available to watch in full now on All 4.", "9fdf433660fe565d881d608a48c87deed8df8d175cbe03f03d1abe4c": "Covid concerns may have subsided and though they're far from gone, now another virus, Monkeypox, has been making headlines. Here's what you need to know. What is Monkeypox? Monkeypox is a rare viral infection that typically does not spread easily between humans. It's comparable to smallpox but milder, less infectious, and less deadly. Most people recover within a week and the virus disappears on its own, prompting no long-term health effects. However, a more severe illness can occur in a few people.  The virus usually spreads through close contact with an infected person, although there's a low risk of transmission among humans. The symptoms include:   Fever   Headache   Muscle aches   Backache   Swollen lymph nodes   Chills   Exhaustion.   A rash can start too, usually on the face at first before moving to other parts of the body including the genitals. This rash then goes through different changes and can transform to look like chickenpox or syphilis before scabbing. The scabs then fall off, although it can leave a scar behind. People without symptoms are not considered infectious. How many cases have there been? Three cases in London and another in north east of England have just been detected by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), bringing the total up to seven confirmed cases all diagnosed between May 6 and 15. By May 19, a further two cases had been confirmed by the UKHSA, one in London and another elsewhere in the south east of England. Those needing urgent care were treated in specialist disease units in hospital, although they were all found to have the West African strain, which is much milder compared to the Central African. So, why are people concerned? These four new cases do not have known connections with the previous cases announced earlier in May, although investigations are underway to understand the links between them. All four individuals were infected in London. They also all self-identify as gay, bisexual or other men who have sex with men. There's currently no link to travel abroad to places where monkeypox is currently endemic, meaning the medical community is still uncertain where the individuals picked up the virus. Chief medical adviser for UKHSA, Dr Susan Hopkins, said that this is 'rare and unusual', and has prompted the health agency to look into monkeypox transmission in the community. 'We are particularly urging men who are gay and bisexual to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact a sexual health service without delay. 'We are contacting any potential close contacts of the cases to provide health information and advice,' she added. The UKHSA's director of clinical and emerging infections Dr Colin Brown also noted: 'While investigations remain ongoing to determine the source of infection, it is important to emphasise it does not spread easily between people and requires close personal contact with an infected symptomatic person. 'The overall risk to the general public remains very low.' The World Health Organisation (WHO) is now looking into how the virus is circulating and the risk it poses to both endemic and non-endemic country. They also predicted that case numbers and the number of countries monkeypox is in will rise. How is it usually transmitted? The infection is usually picked up from infected animals in rainforests. Minor outbreaks usually occur in West and Central Africa, but transmission is low because it can only happen through direct contact with lesions or respiratory sections. Infectious disease epidemiologist Mateo Prochazka explained on Twitter just why the new findings were so surprising. He wrote: 'Close contact between two people (such as during sex) could also facilitate transmission - but this has never been described before.'  He continued: 'What is even more bizarre is finding cases that appear to have acquired the infection via sexual contact. This is a novel route of transmission that will have implications for outbreak response and control.' He also pointed out that work is ongoing, especially when it comes to protecting health workers, a sexual health service response and preventing an increase in stigma and inequalities. Is this the first time it's been identified in the UK? No - three people were diagnosed in September 2018 and an additional person was named in December 2019 after flying back from Nigeria. Another three cases were reported from within the same family in May and June 2021, after the person who initially caught it travelled back from Nigeria.", "412eb485c0acd1d3fc6ce13860b6938bf7a68f23a82d393f13261bc4": "Boris Johnson has been blamed for enabling Westminster's sleaze culture following the arrest of a Tory MP on suspicion of rape. Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said the latest allegations were 'utterly shocking' and there are some MPs 'who are behaving outrageously' and 'need to punished'. The unnamed parliamentarian, who is in his 50s, was arrested on suspicion of rape and sexual assault on Tuesday evening. He has been asked to stay away from Westminster by the party as inquiries continue and has been released on bail. The Tories have so far decided not to remove the party whip, meaning he can still sit as a Tory MP. Davey said it 'shouldn't even be a question' that the whip is removed as he accused the Tories of 'dragging their feet when one of their own has broken the law'. He told Sky News: 'I believe in the process of law, but in the meantime during these investigations, these extremely serious allegations, of course the whip should be removed. 'I can't believe the Conservatives are yet again, dragging their feet when one of their own has broken the law.' Alluding to the partygate scandal that has engulfed Downing Street, he added\\; 'This is becoming a theme. And maybe it's because the prime minister breaks the law and lies about it and gets away with it. 'It's a prime minister who has created a culture, particularly in the Conservative Party, and this is setting a very bad example for the country, for our young people. 'And the prime minister, frankly -- you know I've called for him to resign -- but I don't believe he's a decent person. 'He's not a decent person to be the prime minister of our great country. And I think true patriots would want him to go. 'This whole culture, it rots from the top sometimes, a fish rots from his head, and if I think we got rid of the prime minister, it will be a big step forward to beginning to address some of these problems.' Scotland Yard said the man was detained on suspicion of rape and sexual assault offences spanning seven years. He has also been accused of indecent assault, abuse of a position of trust and misconduct in a public office. The Metropolitan Police said officers initially received a complaint about the MP in January 2020.  News of the arrest came just weeks after Neil Parish resigned as a Tory MP for watching porn in the Commons. Imrad Ahmad Khan also quit as the Conservative MP for Wakefield after being convicted of sexually assaulting a teenage boy. David Warburton, the MP for Somerton and Frome, was suspended over allegations of sexual harassment and drug use. And Rob Roberts, the MP for Delyn in North Wales, was also suspended by the Conservatives for sexually harassing a member of his staff.

Dealing with mental health issues is difficult, especially in relationships. Of-course the person who struggles with their mental health is the person dealing with most of the hardship. But mental health issues can also affect the other person in the relationship, too. And things become even more complicated when you're considering a break-up.  This is the case for this week's reader: Louise.  Louise and her partner of 18 months recently broke up and she says his behaviour became 'controlling and manipulative'. After an argument, he packed his bags and left. 'We were both devastated as we still loved each other. He begged to come back for ages, but I held my ground and he respected my wishes,' she says. 'After a few weeks he came to pick up his belongings and we had a very emotional talk.' Louise noticed her ex had been self-harming since their break up. He's currently seeking counselling and believes he might have bipolar disorder. 'He misses me terribly, as I do him but I'm getting on with my life, meeting friends, doing things I enjoy and building my own self esteem back,' she says. 'He seems to be relying on me. 'My concern is I've given him false hope. I'm not saying getting back together is out of the question, but I'm nowhere close to that yet.' Louise's ex wants them to get back together, but she's unsure. How can she navigate the situation, while being sensitive to her ex's mental health needs? Clearly this is a hard situation to be in. Counselling Directory member Jo Kierstead tells Louise: 'I can sense the battle between your heart and your head. Your connection to your ex runs deep, you've shared history and invested time into this relationship and navigated an especially challenging chapter of life together, under the intensity of the pandemic.' Here's some advice for those facing a similar situation:  How can Louise navigate this situation whilst being sensitive to her ex's mental health needs?  'I would encourage Louise to reflect on where her own mental health is at. When our own mental health is under strain, it's hard to find clarity and we can make poor choices, so, if she can make herself a priority, it will serve her better in the longer-term,' Kierstead says.  'Her ex's self-harm is complicated, it's known to be an unhealthy coping technique for issues she alone can't fix for him. So while she may be tempted into 'saviour mode,' she has to be honest about what she can or can't offer her ex right not.' Kierstead explains that 'putting boundaries around what feels ok, and as importantly, what doesn't, will help her safeguard her own mental health'. 'For example, she may feel she wants to keep in communication with her ex to offer him support, but I would encourage her to be clear in her mind about why and how and in what capacity.' Kierstead says she could start with 'I am willing to offer you support but only as a friend and not in a romantic capacity.' 'And backing this up with tone of voice, content and frequency of future messages to ensure she cannot be misinterpreted or offer more support than feels ok to give.' How can we support a partner who has mental health issues? 'Mental ill health affects one in four of us, and living without help can put a huge strain on individuals and further erode our own mental health,' Kierstead shares. 'The best support is shared, I would encourage everyone, whether as the partner or as an individual, to broaden their own support systems by seeking out ways to avoid feeling isolated, overwhelmed or trapped in a downward spiral. 'There may be a support on a national level - try Mind - or it could be closer to home through a local initiative. The best way forward to is to explore what's out there, keep talking, keep lines of communication open with friends and family.'
