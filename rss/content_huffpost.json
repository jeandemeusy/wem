Both actors described an ugly scene of violence at a secluded rental home in Australia where Depp had been filming a movie -- but their versions of what transpired differed dramatically. Heard said multiple times that evening in March 2015 was 'terrifying,' describing it as the most scared she'd ever felt. At the height of the violence, Heard said, Depp allegedly penetrated her with a bottle repeatedly, putting pressure on her pubic bone. When he stopped, she said, she was afraid to move because she didn't know if the bottle was broken. She was bleeding, and went to the bathroom to throw up. 'I can't believe I have to do this,' she testified, while her attorney apologised for asking her to recount the alleged experience. 'Johnny had the bottle inside of me,' she said. According to Heard, the incident began after Depp started drinking and took an unknown quantity of the party drug MDMA. The pair were married at this point in their relationship -- they divorced in 2016 -- but had not seen each other in weeks due to their respective work schedules.  She said that when he shoved her, she shoved back.  'Do you want to go, little girl?' Depp asked, in Heard's telling.  Depp then allegedly began striking Heard, at one point throwing her onto a pingpong table that collapsed before starting to hit her again. At another point, Heard said she grabbed an empty bottle of alcohol Depp was waving at her tauntingly, and smashed it onto the tile floor, breaking it.  'It was like a lightbulb switch went off. He starts screaming. I don't know if he backhanded me or hit me normally, I don't really recall, but I remember it sent me down to the ground,' Heard said, crying. 'I remember by the time I picked myself off the floor, I stand up, he's got a bottle in his hand. He threw it at me. It missed, thankfully, but I kind of pulled myself back ... at some point, he had a broken bottle up against my face, neck area, by my jawline. He told me he'd carve up my face,' she testified.  'I honestly don't remember if I threw anything in his direction. I don't think I did,' Heard said. 'I just remember him having me by the nightgown. I remember him flailing me, throwing me around, I'm flailing. This was after there were some bottles broken on the floor. This was after -- again, forgive me, I wish I could remember the sequence, but it's flashes -- he's throwing these bottles at me.'  In Depp's telling, he never hit Heard or any other woman. Instead, Heard chucked a broken bottle at him inside the house in Australia, and it sliced off the tip of one finger. At one point during his dayslong testimony, Depp stood up and spread his fingers before the courtroom, displaying the one that had been repaired by doctors.  The manager of the rental house testified last month about finding Depp's fingertip in a bloody paper towel.  But Heard said she was simply trying to get away from Depp and protect herself.  'At some point, I'm up against a wall and he's screaming at me that he fucking hates me. That I ruined his life,' Heard testified. At another, she said, Depp ripped off her nightgown, leaving her naked.  After the attack, Heard said she found the house had been trashed, with empty bags of what she said was cocaine scattered around. Images shown in court showed splotches of blood on the floor, along with messages scrawled in paint and what Heard said was blood from Depp's injured finger on the walls, a couch, a lampshade and other furniture. Mashed potatoes were smeared 'all over' the walls, along with other foods, including pieces of raw steak that had been wrapped in the fragments of her nightgown, according to Heard. 'It was clear he was just out of his mind. He wrote on the back of a pillow in blood,' Heard said. 'It looked like he ran out of blood ... it wasn't bleeding enough, and he went and got paint, and it became paint and blood.'  Depp has been open about his struggles with alcohol and drug addiction in the past, but maintains that he never abused his ex-wife -- rather, he says he was the one who was abused. He said on the stand that her abuse claims were 'heinous' and 'not based in any species of truth.' Both actors' testimony came as part of Depp's defamation lawsuit against Heard over a 2018 Washington Post editorial she wrote with lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union, describing her as a domestic violence survivor.  Earlier in the day, Heard built on testimony she gave on Wednesday alleging that the people who helped manage Depp's career ignored his bad behaviour and helped cover it up by, for example, changing him out of soiled clothes after he'd passed out. On Thursday, she told of an incident on a private plane in 2014 where Depp confronted her about steamy scenes she'd filmed with actor James Franco for the film The Adderall Diaries, which debuted in 2015.  'He called me a slut,' she said. Heard had described many instances throughout her testimony where Depp accused her of cheating on him with other people.  On the plane, she said that she tried distancing herself from Depp, who began 'throwing things ... ice cubes, utensils.' Then, she alleged, he slapped her in the face while a friend of the couple sat nearby. People who worked for Depp were also aboard, she said. When Heard got up, Depp kicked her in the back, causing her to fall to the floor of the plane, she said.  'No one said anything. No one did anything. You could hear a pin drop on that plane. You could feel the tension, but no one did anything,' she said.  During the incident in Australia, Heard said that after Depp's security arrived to offer help, he took out his penis and said he would write messages for her in urine. Heard recalled the security officers being amused.  In the courtroom, Depp grinned when his ex-wife mentioned him urinating.  Heard described several other scenes of violence over the course of the day, including one in which she said he punched her so hard in the face that she thought he had broken her nose. Depp had accused her of flirting with another woman, she said.  At another point, Heard said Depp had grabbed her by the hair and kicked her in the back in a hotel room during the press tour for Depp's 2015 film Mortdecai. She sobbed as she recalled checking the internet for photos of her red carpet appearance because she had brought a strapless dress to wear, and was concerned about bruises or marks showing up in the photos.  Depp and Heard were married in a civil ceremony in Los Angeles at Depp's mother's home, and then flew to the actor's private island for a party and beachside celebration with friends and family. Although he was wealthier than she was, Heard said Depp refused to entertain the notion of creating a prenuptial contract.  'He said the only way out of this was death,' she said of their marriage.  Heard is expected to resume testimony next week. ", "0dba780d0d2eee581db53edff8ac4babf17d8423496d554a496a7baa": "Hairy Bikers star Dave Myers has revealed he is undergoing treatment for cancer. The 64-year-old says this year will be a 'write off' as he continues chemotherapy for the undisclosed type of cancer. Dave revealed he was fighting the disease on the Hairy Bikers Agony Uncles podcast, opening up to his fellow Hairy Biker and cooking partner Si King.  'I haven't been too well recently and basically, I've got to have some chemo,' he said. 'You know all this anyway, so this year is going to be a bit quiet for me. 'I'm not going to be filming, some of the festivals I'm not going to be able to go to, some may be okay but this year's a bit of a write off for us. 'I have had to speak up about this because I don't want to hide under a rock, but I would love it if people respected my privacy and just let me get on with it and give Si and our team all the support they need, that would be great. But look, the prognosis is okay, I'm going to be fine.' He continued: 'I've just got to tuck in, look after myself, eat sensibly and get over this mess, flog books, and be a happy person so within that, that's where I am. 'I may be a baldy biker for a while so it's just a warning, I don't want to make a fuss about it, I look alright bald actually.' Dave, who competed on Strictly Come Dancing in 2013, has previously spoken about overhauling his lifestyle after doctors warned him he was 'morbidly obese' and could be 'heading for an early grave'. 'I was a Northern carbohydrate monster who was morbidly obese six years ago and weighed over 18 stone,' he said in 2018. 'Si and I were warned we were morbidly obese and heading for an early grave, so our weight loss saved our lives. 'I'm 6ft, now around 15 stone and aim to drop to 14 stone. I cycle, jog, and eat as healthily as possible. I'd never have managed to take part in Strictly Come Dancing in 2013 if I hadn't got healthy.' In celebration of his weight loss, Dave competed in Strictly with Karen Hauer, which he described as a 'spectacular privilege'.", "0d6d55198623078b4db66c76b9cc30e3570056dbb78c105f5d5a00c3": "The Certified Lover Boy Drake just pulled the ultimate move on an online critic.  The drama-filled interaction started on Tuesday when an Instagram user poked fun at Drake's son, Adonis, after the rapper commented about fathers who are 'elated and competitive and over supportive' of their children's pursuits. In response, the Instagram user wrote, 'Ya son prolly play with ghost writers.'  The snarky comment was in reference to past controversies where the Canadian rapper was accused of relying on ghostwriters and not drafting his own verses. Drake , who goes by @champagnepapi on the platform, decided to respond in the most Drake way: He swiftly tracked down the commenter's wife and followed her on Instagram.  'I just followed your girl cause she's prob miserable and needs some excitement in her life,' he teased.  The woman Drake followed, who goes by Toni Bowden on the social platform, shared the tea on her Instagram Story. 'Oh hey @champagnepapi,' she captioned in a screenshot of her followers, with the God's Plan rapper listed as one of them. 'My husband @ceddybo_ybagnm decides to be a troll and now @champagnepapi thinking I need excitement in my life,' she wrote, alongside laughing and eyes emojis.  But the debacle didn't end there.  Drake, who has cautioned his fans in his lyrics over the years about stealing girls away from their boyfriends and husbands, annihilated the original commenter with one final blow by sending Bowden a direct message after seeing her posts. 'I'm here for u ma,' he wrote to her. The Take Your Girl artist reunited with Future last month for several features on the March Madness rapper's ninth studio album, I Never Liked You. This week, Drake was confirmed to appear on Jack Harlow's new album Come Home the Kids Miss You, which is released today (Fri 6 May).", "c144ceb85ae9618299c2f64bcdbdfa113a57608419de8831b4cda991": "Let the fiery new trailer for the Game Of Thrones prequel series House Of The Dragon scorch whatever sour taste the end of the fantasy drama left behind.  HBO has unveiled an extended look at the forthcoming prequel set hundreds of years before the events of Thrones and based on author George R.R. Martin's 2018 novel, Fire & Blood. The trailer attempts to capture much of what made the flagship series so successful: Dragons roar, families squabble and dynasties almost certainly crumble in the roughly minute-long clip, which puts the ruthless House Targaryen front and centre. Sporting a set of blonder than blond wigs, King Viserys Targaryen (Paddy Considine) and his children, Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen (Emma D'Arcy) and Prince Daemon Targaryen (Matt Smith), rule over the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros before, as Thrones history tells us, a brutal civil war tears the family apart. The prequel series, however, begins with the Targaryens firmly seated on the Iron Throne, as we see glimpses of recognisable rivals Houses Stark, Velaryon, and Lannister pledging their allegiance to the family. But in the trailer, the threats appear to be a bit closer to home. The Targaryen children openly thirst for power, with a woman warning the princess, who is named as the king's heir, 'Men would sooner put the realm to the torch than see a woman ascend the Iron Throne.'  As the title promises, there are dragons galore here -- the creatures were thought to be extinct at the start of Thrones -- with Smith's character seemingly accessorising his outfits with a scaled dragon egg. The trailer concludes with one of the fire-breathers doing what it does best, as an unseen character ominously says, 'History does not remember blood. It remembers names.' Scheduled to premiere 21 Aug on HBO and HBO Max, House Of The Dragon also stars Olivia Cooke, Steve Toussaint, Eve Best, Fabien Frankel, Sonoya Mizuno and Rhys Ifans.

Conservative leader of Carlisle City Council, John Mallinson, vented his frustration after Labour picked up control of the new Cumberland authority after Thursday's round voting. The Tories lost 14 seats on the council in north west England, while Labour gained 12 and took overall control. Mallinson, who will see the council he led replaced by the new Cumberland authority, told the BBC that he had 'lost some very good colleagues' in the election, and had found it 'difficult to drag the debate back to local issues' while campaigning because of partygate and the cost-of-living crisis. Mallinson said: 'I don't think it was helping to get comments from people like George Eustice talking about people using value brands to ease their shopping bills. That just seems to have come over very patronising.' He added: 'I think it is not just partygate, there is the integrity issue. Basically I just don't feel people any longer have the confidence that the prime minister can be relied upon to tell the truth.' Asked if he thought Conservative MPs should oust the PM, Mallinson said: 'That would be my preference, yes.' On Sky News, he said: '(Johnson) must shoulder a lot of the blame. I have been canvassing in rural areas over the last few weeks and it's been the one issue that people have brought up time and time again. Partygate, the cost of living crisis, the feel that the government were not in touch ... and sadly I have to say the prime minister cannot be relied upon to necessarily to be telling the truth.' He added: 'I think he should consider his position now.' When asked whether the areas three Tory MPs in the region should attempt to oust Johnson, he replied: 'I call upon them to do what they think is right.' Meanwhile, Johnson's Tories face losing control of a flagship London authority to Labour - but there was a mixed picture for Keir Starmer's party outside the capital. Wandsworth, which has been a Conservative authority for more than 40 years, looks set to fall to Labour, with the Tories fearing other boroughs will also be lost. But outside London, the Liberal Democrats won Hull from Labour, while the Greens also picked up seats in contests around England. Council seats are up for grabs in Scotland, Wales and many parts of England, while there are elections to Stormont in Northern Ireland. Votes were only being counted in some of the English contests overnight, including key authorities in the capital.", "a5300fe1e74ed2ea82a04a355e0d00a0fa61d49a78516115aec9e91a": "Thousands of votes have been counted in English council elections overnight, with results declared by 58 authorities. With hundreds more to come across the UK, here's what we know so far. Labour makes advances in London  The clearest trend of the night was the Conservative vote going down in the capital, reflecting ongoing changes in voting habits that have increasingly tilted London towards Labour. In the most significant result overnight, the flagship Tory council of Wandsworth fell to Labour. 'Boris Johnson losing Wandsworth is monumental,' a Labour source said. 'This was the Tories' jewel in the crown.'  The south London borough is renowned for its low taxes and went Tory in 1978. It's almost obligatory to refer to it as Margaret Thatcher's favourite council. Labour weren't finished there, with the Conservatives also losing Westminster - which it had held since the authority was created in 1964 - and Barnet. These are two more huge scalps for Keir Starmer. Tory fury with Boris Johnson The elections are taking place against the backdrop of the partygate scandal, a Tory MP resigning over watching porn in the Commons chamber and the squeeze on household budgets. Unsurprisingly, national issues were having an effect as dozens of Conservative councillors lost their seats across the country. Labour won the new Cumberland Council, where all three local MPs are Tory, prompting a local Conservative leader to call for the PM to go. John Mallinson, leader of Carlisle City Council, which will be replaced by the new Cumberland authority, told the BBC: 'I think it is not just partygate, there is the integrity issue. 'Basically I just don't feel people any longer have the confidence that the prime minister can be relied upon to tell the truth.' In Portsmouth, where the Tories lost four seats, Simon Bosher the leader of the Conservative group, said Johnson should 'take a good, strong look in the mirror' because 'those are people that are actually bearing the brunt on the doorstep of behaviour of what's been going on in Westminster'. Ravi Govindia, leader of the Wandsworth Tories, said: 'Let's not be coy about it, of course national issues were part of the dilemma people were facing.' The Lib Dems and Greens make gains  It was a good night for the 'third parties'. The Liberal Democrats added to recent Westminster by-election successes in North Shropshire and Chesham and Amersham by securing victory in Hull in a straight fight with Labour for control of the authority. The Conservatives also lost control of West Oxfordshire after the Lib Dems made a series of gains. At around 6am, the Lib Dems had gained one authority and 34 more seats while the Greens had put on 19 councillors. Questions over Labour's progress nationwide The big war of spin in the next few hours is likely to be over whether Labour are making sufficient gains - particularly in the 'red wall' seats that transformed the electoral map in 2019. As well as success in Cumberland (a Labour source is quoted as saying: 'Workington man has voted Labour') and London, Labour also gained control of Southampton from the Conservatives. But Tories activists were quick to point to a lack of progress elsewhere. Labour maintained its grip on Sunderland, and slowed the shedding of seats in recent years. But is steadying the ship in its former heartlands good enough given the government's recent troubles? The Conservatives claimed the 'blue wall is building' after making gains in Nuneaton and Bedworth, which will be another disappointment for Labour. But Keir Starmer's party will be keen to point to the drubbing they took at the last general election, and the fact that the last time these specific seats were contested four years ago set a high bar to clear given Theresa May's chaotic administration.", "e774cb84e023df7cb7e89a8bb753d1a2a5041d5f3016fa4046570633": "Labour has taken two major scalps by winning the flagship Tory councils of Westminster and Wandsworth. The totemic victories came amid fresh calls from Conservatives for Boris Johnson to quit as party leader. In another boost for Keir Starmer, Labour gained Barrnet Council in north London from the Conservatives. Labour has also won the new Cumberland Council, where all three local MPs are Tory. Wandsworth, renowned for its low taxes, turned blue in 1978, a year before Margaret Thatcher, who considered the council her favourite, was elected prime minister. 'Boris Johnson losing Wandsworth is monumental. This was the Tories' jewel in the crown,' a Labour source said. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said that 'history has been made' with the victory. Khan tweeted a photograph of himself standing beside Labour councillor Simon Hogg, the council's new leader. Alongside the photograph, Khan wrote: 'The three words we've wanted to hear for so long: WANDSWORTH LABOUR GAIN.' Westminster has been held by the Tories since its creation in 1964, and was where Johnson cast his ballot yesterday. In Barnet, the outgoing Conservative leader Daniel Thomas said: 'I think this is a warning shot from Conservative supporters and I think our loss today is not only due to the fact that I have just mentioned but also a fair number of Conservative voters who just didn't go out to vote, stayed at home.' He added: 'Clearly if Labour are to get a majority in Parliament they need to win Barnet. They won the council, if they win our parliamentary constituencies as well, then it doesn't bode well for us to form a Government in future general elections.' The Tories also lost Worcester to no overall control, with gains for the Greens and Labour. Labour also gained Southampton from the Tories, who only won control of the council last year. But there were signs Labour was struggling to make significant gains elsewhere outside the M25. Meanwhile, the Lib Dems took Kingston upon Hull from Labour and were also edging towards winning West Oxfordshire from the Tories. Lib Dem deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: 'This is a great night for the Liberal Democrats. We're making progress all over the country - building on our historic by-election victories last year.' The elections are set against the backdrop of the partygate scandal and a cost-of-living crisis that could turn into a recession. Council seats are also up for grabs in Scotland, Wales and many parts of England, while Northern Ireland is electing its new assembly in what could be the most significant vote of them all, with Sinn Fein seeking to become the largest party. Many of the English seats were last contested in 2018, during Theresa May's chaotic administration, meaning there may only be limited opportunities for opposition parties to make further gains.", "a38eb269e6db57e00319566bbd07ec2b1171c9999dd70e82fc41eb7f": "Feeling powerless is a desperate, overwhelming sensation, yet one that's very much embedded in the human experience - especially lately. Many are facing this crippling, paralysing reaction, thanks to war, the pandemic, attacks on women's rights and so many more events seemingly out of our control. This emotion can affect anyone, including the therapists who often help others work through it.  'As a therapist, a lot of people assume that I have it all together, or don't experience mental health challenges myself - which couldn't be farther from the truth,' said Rachel Wright, a licensed therapist in New York. 'Not only do I have diagnosed major depressive disorder and panic disorder, but I also have times where I feel powerless and hopeless. While I can show up for my own clients, I sometimes struggle to show up for myself.'  Below, Wright and other therapists share their go-to coping tips for when they're feeling powerless: Schedule an appointment with a therapist They practice what they preach. Wright said therapy is a core component in mental health hygiene, and she's not alone in this belief. Dr. Paul Poulakos, a board-certified psychiatrist in New York, pointed out that therapy can help in situations when you're feeling hopeless and are struggling to navigate that. 'If you are not coping with your own mental health, it makes being empathetic very difficult, as well as burnout being more probable,' Poulakos said. 'More specifically, [therapy] can assist us in reframing our circumstances and the negative thinking that often leaves us feeling hopeless or powerless.' Say no to anything that is going to add to your emotion right now Poulakos said he cannot emphasise enough how important it is to have boundaries when you're feeling hopeless. 'Learn how to say no and make sure you are doing it once in a while,' he said. 'If I ever even start to feel selfish for saying no to things, this reminds me to take inventory and question whether I'm setting boundaries.' These boundaries can be as simple as taking a few moments to yourself in the middle of the day, or taking some time off work. 'Whether it be for a day or for a month, taking a vacation does not always need to be an extreme and costly trip -- sometimes closing the laptop and unplugging is all you need,' Poulakos said. Establish your 'core four' Identify four activities that help you to feel 'grounded, connected and happy,' said Forrest Talley, a clinical psychologist based in California.  For example, yours could be cycling, interior design, fostering dogs and traveling. One of his personal tools is building something, like home projects.  Terri Cole, a licensed psychotherapist and author of Boundary Boss, said her core activities include mindful movement like yoga, baking, journaling and getting out in nature. Therapist Alfiee Breland-Noble, founder of The AAKOMA Project and host of the Couched in Color podcast, also finds that spending time in nature is therapeutic and calming, and says this is one of her first lines of attack against feelings of powerlessness. 'I set my intention on being positive, and find activities for the remainder of the day that help me maintain my peace,' she said. Find a way to burn off anxious energy 'Exercise is so helpful in blowing off steam,' said Dr. Alex Dimitriu, a double board-certified psychiatrist and founder of Menlo Park Psychiatry & Sleep Medicine.  Talley said intensive exercise is one of his 'constant go-to' stress relievers. 'When things even begin to feel over the top, I'll put extra intensity into my workouts,' he said. Think: heavy weight training, HIIT or judo (some of his favorites).  If that's not your thing, try some gentle movement, like walking, biking, swimming or yoga. Moving your body may help expel some of the stress that's physically building up inside. Go somewhere calming without your phone It can be easy to doomscroll into oblivion when there are events happening in the world that you have no power over. Breaks are necessary for survival. Try spending some time in a relaxing place where you don't have access to constant information. Dimitriu personally enjoys sitting in a steam room or sauna. 'These are becoming [some of] the few places you can sit without access to your phone,' he said. 'I've had some amazing insights, peaceful meditation, and mind relaxation in the quiet silence of a steam room. The heat helps, too.' Spend a few moments focusing on something that makes you feel uplifted This could be practising a skill you know you excel at, leaning into your spirituality or faith (which means something different to everyone), or reading a book or poem that speaks to you. Breland-Noble uses mantras. Simple phrases with powerful messages, these short sentences provide meaning and hope. 'Phrases like 'The cream always rises to the top,' 'Remember who you are,' 'You come from a long line of proud people who overcame tremendous odds,' and 'You are equipped with everything you need,'' are some that allow her to find footing, she said. Lean on loved ones Whether it's your partner, immediate family, best friend or a wider community, nearly every therapist recommended talking to and spending time with loved ones.  'Spending time with family is important,' said Talley, who noted that he becomes even more conscious of the need for time with his wife and children when times are particularly tough.  Find something you can do 'Personally, when I feel powerless or hopeless - usually about the state of the world as opposed to the state of my life - I focus on what I can do,' Cole said. This can include sharing resources for people, donating to organizstions that make a difference in the world, advocating for causes you care about, posting your thoughts on social media, and engaging in thoughtful conversations with others. Another thing you can do? Take care of your basic needs. 'I try to eat a little better, sleep a little better, move a little bit more, and talk with that small circle of people that help me see more clearly and accurately,' said Kevin Gilliland, a clinical psychologist based in Texas.  You do have control over something, no matter what: yourself and your actions.", "d564b4bd45fa34c883e242bf151d446e443708e0c7bc0ccfdabade84": "It's easy to smile at the thought of a margarita.  'It's the world's favourite cocktail, and there are good reasons why,' Jeremy Bohen, mixologist and co-founder of the canned cocktail brand QNSY, tells HuffPost. 'The ingredients are widely available and relatively inexpensive, and it doesn't require much in the way of tools or technique. Plus, the flavours are straightforward enough for the occasional imbiber, but still sophisticated enough to appeal to a connoisseur.'  For many people, this drink is all about good times. 'Margaritas are for celebrating and getting together with friends,' says Ana Martinez, assistant director of food and beverage and agave spirits expert at Hilton Los Cabos Beach & Golf Resort. Yet as much as this is a cocktail that gives off laid-back, happy vibes, it also requires attention to detail and balance. 'Creating a well-made margarita is similar to dancing the tango,' saysGabriela Abaroa, bartender at the Ritz-Carlton Sarasota. 'The flavours are the complete opposite of one another, but they also complement each other perfectly.' And, like every good drink, this one should keep you wanting more. 'A perfect margarita should hold you in a perpetual cycle of being refreshed, while causing you to become thirsty for another one,' said Maxwell Reis, beverage director at West Hollywood, California's Gracias Madre. Experts prefer rocks, not blended Our cocktail experts are firmly on team 'rocks,' with none of them preferring a blended drink. 'A truly well-constructed margarita becomes too diluted when blended with ice,' says food photographer, recipe developer and author Jackie Alpers. 'I definitely prefer rocks to frozen, because you get a better sense of the details when you don't blend it into a slush,' says Eric Trueheart, co-founder of Black Yeti Beverage. 'Don't get me wrong, the slurpee margarita is a fun drink, without a doubt. But if you want to taste something complex, interesting and delicious, rocks is the best way to go.' One easy step that too many people skip Before you even get started, pop your glassware in the freezer. 'Just one minute in a freezer will keep your cocktail as cold as when you use warmed-up plates to keep meals warm,' says Jim Wrigley, beverage manager at the Cayman Islands Kimpton Seafire Resort & Spa's Coccoloba Bar & Grill. And pay attention to your ice As you're getting ready to shake your cocktail, keep in mind that another factor separating a 'meh' at-home drink from a 'wow' mixologist-made one is the quality of the ice you're using. 'If your ice tastes like the other things in your freezer, you're in for a not-so-tasty surprise,' Reis says. 'I don't think most at-home drinkers realise how much of that ice turns into water that becomes a large portion of your drink. And if you're using flimsy ice, it will melt too quickly, and you'll wind up with a watery marg that's not cold enough.' Don't worry too much about buying fancy bar equipment, because anything can be a shaker, experts say. 'Shake it up in whatever's easiest for you - an 'official' cocktail shaker, mason jar or blender,' says Valerie Alvarado, national portfolio agave ambassador at Pernod Ricard. It won't take long, we promise: 'Shake it five to 10 seconds, depending on how vigorous you want to be,' says Lime Fresh Mexican Grill's beverage director, Ethan Albrecht-Carrie. And then, as fun as it is to act like Tom Cruise in 'Cocktail,' stop. 'Don't overshake the cocktail, or you'll water it down,' says Anthony Aviles, director of operations at the Ritz-Carlton Sarasota. Get the right tequila The good news is that the alcohol you use in margaritas doesn't need to be an over-the-top brand. 'Choose a quality silver tequila, but don't go crazy on price,' Bohen says. 'Aged tequila is great to sip on its own, but in my opinion, it's out of place in a margarita.' As you're shopping, be sure to read labels carefully. 'Tequila should be 100% agave,' Abaroa says. He's a fan of blanco tequila, noting its 'definitive, clean flavour.' The presence of agave in tequila is key, the experts say. 'Any tequila that doesn't say '100% agave' is usually mixed in with other materials like syrups and extracts, so stay away from those,' says Xyza Dapal, food and beverage operations manager at Philadelphia's Sabroso + Sorbo in The Notary Hotel. While you're reading labels, take note of where the bottle was produced. 'Tequilas from the Los Altos region, with oven-baked agaves, really bring the citrus, fruit and roasted agave flavour,' Alvarado says. Add only the best ingredients Since it has just a few ingredients, you don't need to cut corners with pre-made mixers. Those bright yellow and orange concoctions, Aviles says, are akin to 'tempting the ulcer gods and dancing with diabetes.' Sweetener: Most recipes call for agave or simple syrup, and preferences varied among our experts. 'Use good organic agave nectar,' Albrecht-Carrie says. 'I prefer a light amber, because darker agave nectars tend to overpower and need to be diluted.' On the other hand, you've probably got what you need in your pantry to whip up simple syrup, if you'd rather use that. 'I know some people like to use agave in margaritas, and there's some poetry there, but I much prefer simple syrup,' Bohen says. 'It really is simple to make. Use equal parts water and sugar, warmed just enough to dissolve the sugar.' Fresh juice: 'I truly believe that without fresh lime juice, margaritas lack the tartness and acid that can only be attained from limes,' said cocktail influencer Carlos Ruiz. That fresh juice, it turns out, brings more to your drink than just its liquid. 'Hand-juicing the limes will introduce the delicate oils which come from the peel,' says Stuart Yurczyk, co-founder, vice president and general manager at Mixly Cocktail Co. 'Citrus oils have a fantastic aroma and add depth to your cocktails.' Once you've mastered the art of juicing limes, you may want to experiment with flavors by tossing in other fresh ingredients. 'Adding freshly cut jalapeno, mango, strawberry, avocado or even cilantro will elevate your margarita,' Alvarado says. Salt: Whether you're a salted-rim lover or hater, you can find a mixologist who shares your views. On the 'pro' side, Wrigley is a believer. 'Good salt is essential,' he says. 'We use Maldon salt for the classics and homemade spicy salt, using local peppers, for our Spicy Margarita. Another fantastic element is Gusano salt, a Mexican salt using the 'worm,' a grub that feeds on ripe agaves. And we house-smoke salt, using local logwood, for our Mezcal Margaritas.' But not everyone is pro-salt. According to Carlos Kronen, founder and executive director of The Bartender Company, a mobile bartending service, it's not a good idea. 'Salt kills your palate, so a salted rim is only recommended when using low-end tequila,' he says. Somewhere in the middle of the salt debate is Alicia Perry, general manager at San Diego's Polite Provisions. 'When it comes to a salt rim, I always ask about the customer's preference, because salt isn't for everyone,' she says. 'I personally prefer a partial salt rim, so I have a choice with each sip.' Garnishes: Use fresh citrus twists or wedges, fresh peppers or anything else you like. Perhaps try checking out local ingredients to make a margarita truly 'yours.' Alpers mentions a unique garnish she enjoyed at Tucson's El Crisol mezcal bar. 'It was finished with a dried lime slice and creosote leaves,' she said. 'Those leaves come from a bush native to Tucson that releases a sweet smell whenever it rains - or when it's floating on top of a drink. It was a perfect expression of the Tucson desert in every way.' Spicy touches: Once you've mastered the basics, you might want to incorporate other elements, like heat. 'I remember the first time I had a spicy margarita, and it changed my entire understanding of what a margarita can be,' Yurczyk says. 'I'm a Midwest native, so it didn't take long for sweat to begin beading up around my nose and cheekbones, but I was addicted. I hadn't realised it until that moment, but the tequila's smoothness, lime juice's acidity and orange liqueur's sweetness were practically begging for the addition of spice.' 'I was on my honeymoon a looong time ago in Puerto Vallarta and was served a pineapple chile margarita,' says Dora Stone, founder of the vegan Mexican recipe blog Dora's Table. She remains a fan of margarita heat, and her blog includes a popular recipe for a Spicy Hibiscus Ice Margarita. Another tip from Stone: 'Add candied jalapenos or chile powder on the rim, like the ever-so-popular mango chamoy margarita.'", "650dfbbb86e4929acdf7c50fcb2ce5c30c8f6b16a20360a04a5aec10": "We hope you love the products we recommend!

You don't expect that in your mid twenties your skin will, almost overnight, breakout in painful spots. But adult acne is actually super common.  The British Association of Dermatologists reported that 19% of adults aged 25 and over have reported experiencing some form of adult acne, with causes ranging from hormonal imbalances and stress to pollution and clogged pores. And it can be highly stressful if it happens to you.  I say this because I know. All through my teens I had pretty perfect skin (minus the odd party-pooping zit). I felt blessed by the skin gods. But in my early twenties, I noticed I was breaking out with lots of teeny tiny spots, primarily across my t-zone. My skin was painful, red and super sore.  Adult acne was completely new to me, and like any newbie, I tried product after product, each of which promised miracle results, but failed to deliver.  In fact, they often seemed to be making my skin worse. I didn't know it at the time, but acne can actually be exacerbated by using the wrong products for your skin type, and not having a proper targeted skincare routine. Whoops.  I was starting to feel I'd never have blemish free skin again. Then, a friend recommended that I try Nip+Fab's Teen Skin Fix range and, honestly, it's the one. While there's nothing wrong with blemishes (after all, we all get them), if you're finding it hard living with adult acne and the pain and soreness it brings, these are the products I swear by and have used religiously for five years. They might be designed with teens in mind, but don't be put off by the packaging - they're a total game-changer for adult acne, too - both targeting and future-proofing against the blemishes that can blight your skin. The range - face-wash, pads, roller-ball and moisturiser - combines a potent dose of salicylic acid with wasabi extract and tea tree oil, which penetrate deep into your pores to remove impurities and stop breakouts at the source.  If that sounds like blurb, what matters, of course, is results - and I've got them. Even for super sensitive skin like mine, the products didn't cause any issues. My skin now looks and feels much healthier, and my acne is finally under control.", "bc273d7112f307f3c9c85eef57fee8ac8290546e36148b74383b2ed1": "", "c44e8dbee3c9597758669e147f12b86b66238d21b43b5c3c09c4e844": "", "d89ca13b4203dec27acd083fc7cd361e0334d432bdb464038d7aafd7": "", "0bf8d07556aa89273e18a2be3fa38b969bdf737b14d473c93aa23ab0": "The Bank of England has issued a stark warning to British people that the economy is at risk of slipping into a recession as it raised interest rates to 1%. The central bank's hike - by a quarter of a percentage point - means the base rate is at a level last seen in 2009. The move is designed to curb the soaring cost of goods and services - known as inflation - which could go above above 10%, which would be a 40-year high. While effectively putting the brakes on spells bad news for people borrowing money, with mortgage holders likely to feel the immediate impact, it was largely predicted - and could be followed by more increases. The biggest shock came in the warning of a recession - a word that sends alarm bells ringing for many - as the Ukraine war compounds a crippling cost-of-living crisis. What is a recession?  A technical recession is defined by two successive quarters of falling economic output - measured by gross domestic product (GDP), which attempts to summarise all the activity of companies, governments and individuals in an economy in a single figure. Some people argue the term 'recession' is an unreliable indicator because people could be suffering all the effects of an economic downturn, such as long-term unemployment, but the data might not be officially say as much. For instance, a 'double-dip recession' is when a recession is followed by a short-lived recovery and another recession, but people's lives do not feel much different throughout that period. Recessions ultimately have an impact on living standards, but the full effect largely depends on the scale of unemployment and how long it takes for businesses and the jobs market to recover. What's the outlook? On Thursday, the Bank predicted that growth will contract in the final three months of 2022 as the cost squeeze sees households rein in their spending. The UK is set to narrowly miss a technical recession, but the Bank forecast 'very weak' quarterly growth in 2023 and a contraction as a whole next year. They predict GDP will fall by 0.25% and unemployment will pick up sharply. 'It is a very weak projection, a very sharp slowdown,' Bank governor Andrew Bailey told reporters. 'There's a technical definition of a recession it doesn't meet - but put that to one side - it is a very sharp slowdown in activity.' When was the last recession? Not that long ago. In 2020, the Office for National Statistics officially declared the UK in recession - the steepest on record - after the economy plunged by 19.6% between April and June due to the coronavirus lockdown. It followed a 2.2% contraction in the previous three months - marking the first time since the 2008 global financial crisis, when the UK fell into a year-long recession. But this was followed by growth of 17.4% in the third quarter of 2020 - underlining how the economy was lurching from one extreme to another during the early stages of the pandemic.  What is fuelling a potential recession? The world is being buffeted by a unique set of circumstances. Inflation is surging as a result of the easing of the pandemic. It means the costs of goods and services have become more expensive because of a number of factors - such as the scarcity of workers unwilling to do jobs they previously had, and pent-up demand from consumers. Economists believed this was a big problem as the cost of life's expenses was growing faster than people's wages, but that would only be temporary. Then Russia invaded Ukraine, which sent energy prices spiraling given the world's reliance and oil and gas from the region. The Bank has said it was also worried about the impact of renewed Covid-19 lockdowns in China which threaten to hit supply chains again and add to inflation pressures. What is 'stagflation'?  Economists think the Bank is walking a tightrope to avoid an economic 'perfect storm' called stagflation - a contradictory situation where costs are rising but fewer people are in work. The worst of all worlds. Raising interest rates might help to combat inflation, but that could mean the economy stalls. Using interest rates could be a particularly blunt instrument when the inflationary pressures are coming from overseas with higher energy costs. The risk is this: more nudges by way of further interest rate hikes could be the catalyst for a full-blown recession.", "0653fbe0f35311fdd04c56029bf1c164c12b057cd2b98557fcde66ec": "Lorraine Kelly has said she does not expect Boris Johnson to know who she is after he appeared to snub the presenter during an interview with Susanna Reid on Tuesday.  The prime minister's sit-down with the ITV breakfast show made headlines for a number of reasons earlier this week, one of which came after Susanna introduced Lorraine, who hosts the show directly after GMB. 'Who's Lorraine?' Johnson asked. 'Who's Lorraine? Lorraine is a legend,' Susanna replied. The moment soon went viral - and even drew a response from former GMB host Piers Morgan - with Lorraine now having her say on the matter.  Speaking on the Be Honest podcast, she said: '[It] was brilliant, and brilliant because she let him speak. She wasn't trying to point score. She was just trying to get to the heart of the matter. 'And it wasn't kind of two alpha males. It was a forensic, really intelligent interview. She absolutely did her homework and he was on the ropes, because he's broad strokes, he's not attention to detail.' Co-host Bruce Devlin asked Lorraine: 'You say Boris doesn't have attention to detail, how on earth does he not know who you are?' She replied: 'I don't expect him to.' Asked if Boris Johnson knows who Lorraine is, the PM's spokesperson previously told HuffPost UK: 'I think as was clear the prime minister was not fully across the ITV daytime lineup this morning. He has a number of issues to deal with.' Piers Morgan said it was 'over' for Johnson after his apparent knowledge gap.  Trailing his TalkTV show Piers Morgan Uncensored in a chat with the channel's Tom Newton-Dunn, Piers said: 'We all know Lorraine Kelly. I think he knows Lorraine Kelly, he just didn't know what on earth was going on in that whole interview.' He continued: 'I thought Susanna skewered him beautifully and he just lost his way and lost his mind, as he does so often. 'The trouble is he can probably survive partygate to a degree, maybe even survive surging inflation. He can't survive insulting Lorraine Kelly - it's over. It's over for him.'

The Call Me By Your Name actor was due to tread the boards in an adaptation of the critically acclaimed play 4,000 Miles at The Old Vic.  The production, which was also set to star Dame Eileen Atkins, was originally scheduled to open in London in April 2020 but was postponed when theatres across the country had to close their doors due to the pandemic.  However, The Old Vic has now confirmed the show will not be going ahead after it proved 'impossible' to reschedule.  A statement said: 'Following the postponement of 4000 Miles due to the pandemic, and despite an enormous amount of effort from all involved, we have now sadly and reluctantly concluded that we are unable to reschedule the production at a time possible for everyone involved. 'After two years of trying hard to make it work, it has proved impossible. 'We're sorry not to have better news, and we want to thank our audiences for their continued patience and understanding.' Timothee was due to star as 21-year-old Leo, who, after suffering a major loss during a summer bike riding trip, seeks solace in the New York home of his 91-year-old grandmother, Vera.  Thursday's announcement was met with disappointment from Timothee's fans on social media...

The term upskirting refers to someone taking photographs underneath another person's clothing, without their consent. The Countdown host recalled how the star - who she did not name - put his phone under her skirt while she was playing table tennis with her husband, former Strictly Come Dancing professional Pasha Kovalev.  Speaking on the Dirty Mother Pukka podcast, Rachel said: 'He just got an Apple Watch, and at a party at a friend's house, I was playing table tennis with Pash, and this guy, in full view of everyone, came, put his phone on the floor under my skirt where I was playing table tennis, and went and sat back down a couple of metres away while him and all his mates looked at his watch. 'It was like a video basically. So he went and put his phone down so he could look up and went two metres away to go and look at his phone, look up my skirt.' Rachel said she had been 'too polite' at the time, adding: 'Now, being able to digest it and think about it, if someone tried to do that to me again I would break their phone. 'If they've got a problem with that, they can go to the police and we can deal with it in the public. 'That a man obviously thought he could get away with blatantly, brazenly putting his phone, upskirting me on a video for his friends on his phone, and it would be fine! 'Now I would just break his phone and deal with it afterwards,' she said.  'I think the days of being polite, meek and mild, to someone who wants to grab you, nah, done with that.' During the interview, Rachel also reiterated her calls for social media bosses to do more to protect women on their platforms, as she spoke of how she had been sent unsolicited sexual content online. She also discusses the trolling she has experienced, revealing that after speaking publicly on a podcast about it she faced a stream of abuse during her birthday week which left her in tears. She said: 'Early doors, I had no idea how to deal with it. I took everyone at face value and tried to use education and be reasonable and explain and engage. 'At one stage I spoke publicly on a podcast, and it was like a tap had been turned on. Literally, it felt like someone's pressed a button and sent them all in my direction all at once.' The TV star admitted the trolling was 'overwhelming' and led to one of the only times she has argued with Kovalev as he was frustrated to see the 'horrible people' getting to her.

The landmark ruling, known as the Roe vs Wade case, was first established in 1973 and legalised abortion for the whole country. If the Supreme Court does strike this ruling down, America's reproductive rights will be taken back to the 20th Century. Here's everything you need to know. What is Roe v Wade? The ruling guarantees the federal constitutional protection of abortion rights. This means states could not ban abortion. So, since 1973, all women in the US have enjoyed the absolute right to an abortion in the first three months of their pregnancy. Abortion is partially permitted in the second trimester too, up to the point when the fetus could survive outside the womb - this is usually between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. Why is it in the news now? POLITICO obtained a leaked an initial draft majority opinion - labelled '1st Draft' - from the US Supreme Court on Monday night about Roe v Wade. If the document is accurate, it suggests Justice Samuel Alito wants to pull apart the federal constitutional protection of abortion rights, and that he has the majority backing from his peers on the US Supreme Court. This means 36 million people women could lose abortion access, according to Planned Parenthood organisation. In the document, Alito wrote: 'Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. 'And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe [has] enflamed debate and deepened division.' He claimed that the 'Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision', adding: 'It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected representatives.' According to POLITICO, four of the other Republican-appointed justices voted with Alito back in December when Mississippi first called for the case to be overturned and for abortions to be banned after just 15 weeks. This means five out of the nine justices in the Supreme Court supposedly back removing Roe v Wade now. What could the ruling mean? Abortion could become illegal in 22 states if the landmark case is dropped, as individual states could regulate the laws around abortion instead. There are already 13 states which have passed 'trigger laws' - meaning they would automatically ban abortion if the law is overruled in the coming months - while other states are expected to act only once Roe v Wade has definitely been dropped. It would not necessarily become illegal in all states. As California governor Gavin Newsom tweeted: 'We can't trust [the Supreme Court] to protect the right to abortion so we'll do it ourselves.' However, there's no doubt that it would have a substantial impact on the attitude towards abortion rights in the US, and beyond. Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives, said in a joint statement with fellow leading Democrat Chuck Schumer that if accurate, the court was 'poised to inflict the greatest restriction of rights in the past 50 years'. Protests have already begun The leak triggered passionate demonstrations from pro-choice activists on Tuesday, as crowds called on the Democrats in Congress to protect abortion rights. There are concerns that abortions will still happen, even if Roe vs Wade is overturned, but they will not be legal - and so will be unsafe.  While it would be possible for people to travel to states where abortions are still legal, not everyone can afford such a trip, meaning the ruling would affect the poor the most. Taking away the autonomy for people to decide what happens to their bodies is yet another pressing concern, while such a ruling from the Supreme Court may embolden anti-abortion activists all over the world, too. This wasn't out of the blue The clamour against reproductive rights in the US has been growing in the last few years. It really began to pick up pace when Donald Trump appointed three right-leaning people to the Supreme Court during his time in the White Office, making it more conservative than it has been in its entire history. Calls to restrict abortion in Republican states, most recently Oklahoma, have simultaneously been mounting. In 2021 alone, close to 600 abortion restrictions were brought in across the country. Of these, 90 were enacted into law. According to the BBC, that 'is more than in any year' since the Roe ruling. However, just because it was clear this was where the legislation was heading doesn't make it any less shocking. Here's a round-up of how some UK-based commentators feel about the leak: What will happen next? It is not apparent if the document represents the final opinion and justices have changed their minds in the past. The Supreme Court justices are expected to make a decision in late June or early July around the case.  Six of the nine justices who currently sit on the Supreme Court were appointed by Republican presidents. The court only needs a majority to come to a decision. At the moment, five of the Republican appointed justices have backed the move to remove Roe vs Wade, while the three Democrat-appointed are opposing it. Only Republican-appointed Chief Justice John Roberts' vote is unclear at the moment. The Supreme Court and the White House have not yet commented. The leak itself is also alarming, because the Supreme Court is the most secretive of Washington's establishments and so trust among justices - and staff - may now be significantly weakened. How could this impact the UK? No.10 has already slapped down any claims that it will reconsider abortion rights here in the UK.  On Tuesday, prime minister Boris Johnson's spokesperson said the decision was 'a matter for the US courts', but added: 'The UK fully supports women's reproductive rights globally and including the right to access safe and legal abortion.' However, there are usually concerns that the similarities between UK and US culture mean they can influence each other more than people realise.  As leader of the Women's Equality Party Mandu Reid told HuffPost UK, the news is 'chilling'.  She continued: 'It is an outright assault on the rights of American women, threatening to deny 50% of the population their bodily autonomy. 'It has ominous consequences for women everywhere and is a reflection of the global backlash against reproductive rights.' Reid also pointed out: 'Make no mistake, abortion access is not watertight in the UK, and has been under threat for years, as we've seen with recent threats to at-home abortions, the requirement for two doctors to sign off on an abortion, and the fact that it is still not a legal right.'

The Home Office caused outrage when it announced its plan to relocate anyone who arrived by so-called illegal means to the UK - particularly via the English Channel - to the east African country of Rwanda. These asylum seekers would then be inadmissible to the UK under new immigration rules, even once they were processed there. The new proposal has not yet been approved and Downing Street has admitted it will not come into effect for several 'months' - and it blamed this delay on all the legal challenges to the programme. Speaking to the media from Southampton Airport on Wednesday, the prime minister explained the government had always been aware there would be legal challenge to the programme. He explained: 'Of course, there are going to be legal eagles, liberal lawyers, who will try to make this difficult to settle. 'We always knew this was going to happen, but it is a very, very sensible thing. 'If people are coming across the Channel illegally, and if they are, their lives are being put at risk by ruthless and unscrupulous gangsters, which is what is happening at the moment.' Johnson just said that a solution was needed to push back 'those gangsters' behind the trafficking of people across the English Channel. 'I think that's a humane, compassionate and sensible thing to do,' he added. 'I'm not going to pretend to you that is going to be without legal challenges. I think I said that when I announced it, but we will get it done.' But the prime minister's acknowledgement of these 'legal challenges' only seemed to encourage his critics to ask why the policy was not legally sound in the first place. So what are the legal challenges? The prime minister's spokesperson initially promised that flights to Rwanda would happen 'at the earlier opportunity' and that the plan was 'fully legally secure approach that has been tested and thought through'. But, he added: 'We have received pre-action correspondence from a number of legal firms, I can't get into that more... but we still maintain our hope to have the first flights take place in a matter of months.' According to PA news agency, the president of the Law Society of England and Wales - Stephanie Boyce - is also particularly wary of the scheme. 'The PM appears to have little confidence the plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda is legal if he is even at this early stage preparing for it to be challenged in the courts,' she explained. 'It is not clear that the Nationality and Borders Act gives the government the powers to do this. 'There are questions as to whether this scheme would comply with the Refugee Convention, whether refugees threatened with being sent to Rwanda would be able to access justice if they are mistreated.' Heavily criticised by Labour as a sign of the 'complete chaos' in Downing Street, the proposal has also come under fire by the Archbishops of Canterbury and York on 'moral and ethical grounds'.", "6c93c8ee4b41d5007d65e537c0bf8df74aa81f13b1a66d46ac32fc2a": "As soon as Anne Robinson announced she was quitting Countdown after just a year presenting the Channel 4 show, everyone started speculating about who would replace her.

We're guessing filling a tub with some hot water does not cost the remaining 23 quid. Whatever the maths, it's not washing well with us.

The Office for National Statistics reported that there were 1,042 cases in the week leading up to April 22 where Covid was listed on the death certificate. This is a 4% increase compared to the previous seven days, and sadly the highest death rate recorded since February 11. This isn't also even the full picture - there's an expected delay in the data due to the long bank holiday weekend, Good Friday on April 15 and the bank holiday the following Monday. The national break meant fewer deaths were registered across the country. However, this is still far below the death toll recorded during March 2020 when the first wave of infection reached the UK long before vaccines became widely available.  January 2021 saw a staggering number of deaths too, as 8,433 were registered in one week. Rates were also higher in January this year, when the Omicron variant broke through to the general public. At its peak, that wave triggered 1,484 weekly deaths. Approximately 194,868 deaths in the UK had Covid mentioned on the death certificate - and nine out of 10 had the virus listed as the primary cause.  Why's this happening now? While the UK is operating under Downing Street's 'Living with Covid' strategy - meaning all restrictions have been lifted - Infection rates are also falling. Still, the prevalence of Covid within society is still very high. A study from March found Covid levels had reached their highest levels, with around one in 16 people in England having the virus. According to Imperial College React's study, most of these cases were caused by the Omicron stealth variant, BA.2. While this rate of infection has clearly levelled off since scientists did predict in April that - as these positive rates were mainly occurring in children and younger adults - the wave was about to move into the older generations. When it reached people aged over 55, there's a higher rate of severe infection and possible hospitalisation. Professor Paul Elliott, director of the React programme and chairman in epidemiology at Imperial College London, warned that older age groups would be affected as their vaccine immunity would wane earlier. He told the BBC: 'We also know many older people had their booster way back in October or November last year so it's likely there will be some waning of the vaccine against infection, if not hospitalisation.' The number of tests being conducted is also falling, according to the government's Covid dashboard. This is unsurprising now that lateral flow tests are no longer free and are not essential for entry into various venues, as they were under the government's Plan B.", "692d5a3bd0540a0d2969667ca31720dd663d990dd8f1ced690c5e065": "Victoria Beckham has made no secret of the fact that she has no desire to rejoin the Spice Girls (boooo), but could Prince William be the one who makes all of our pop dreams come true and get Posh Spice back on stage?  VB's former bandmate Mel B has revealed that the future king enquired about the possibility of all five Spice Girls regrouping when she collected her MBE on Wednesday. Recalling her brief conversation with William, Mel revealed: 'William told me, 'I'm so delighted that it's me giving you this'. And he asked, 'Will you get the Spice Girls back together?'.  'I told him I was having dinner with Victoria that evening and he said, 'Oh good, I'll work on David then'.'  If the future king can't make this happen then, quite frankly, who the heck can? Mel was honoured with the medal at Buckingham Palace for her services to charitable causes and vulnerable women. In 2018, she became a patron of the charity Women's Aid, after she was allegedly the victim of domestic abuse. Mel split from husband Stephen Belafonte in 2017 after 10 years of marriage. The singer claimed he had been emotionally and physically abusive during that time. Stephen has always vehemently denied all allegations made against him. Mel recently said she is still suffering with the trauma from her previous marriage and has terrible flashbacks that leave her drenched in 'shame, sweat and fear'. Scary Spice also made a cheeky confession after receiving her MBE, admitting she wasn't wearing underwear for the occasion. The 46-year-old wore one of Victoria's designs for the ceremony but she admitted she was 'stark, bollock naked' underneath the red dress. Mel told The Sun: 'Victoria asked me, 'Will you wear nipple covers?' I said, 'Why bother?' 'When it came to the part where Prince William had to pin the MBE on, he asked for a female official to do it. I didn't think I had that much cleavage on show,' she joked.", "3e4a153585c3d0e0ddd4108db3ee09a22a2e672cedc2091f8209e3b3": "Killing Eve star Sandra Oh has revealed there was originally an alternative ending planned for the show.  The hit BBC thriller came to a controversial conclusion last month, with fans and critics calling it out as 'lazy' and 'unoriginal'. The show wrapped up with main characters Eve and Villanelle finally getting it together, before the deadly assassin was shot on the orders of Carolyn Martens and bled to death after jumping into the Thames with Eve. Speaking to Deadline, Sandra, who played Eve, revealed that it was originally conceived that it was her character who would perish in the show's conclusion.  'Honestly, it was going to be the other way around,' she said. 'When I was talking to Laura Neal, our head writer - that was at the beginning of 2020 - and we were chatting about how we were going to end this. I was like, 'You should kill my character'. I thought that would be the strongest and the most interesting ending. 'And not only that, I felt emotionally, it was the right place of where I was at, because at the end of season three, I just felt like Eve was starting to get into kind of like a nihilistic place, and we're like, 'Let's just continue that line and let's go straight into it''. Sandra explained that Covid - which caused numerous delays to the fourth series - meant things changed.  She continued: 'The pandemic happened, and then somewhere in the summertime, they came to me and said, 'We can't do it. We need to change it. Eve needs to live'. 'Eve is the way into this world, she's our everywoman, so it's kind of really super depressing if she dies. So we switched it around and Jodie was very much on board with that.' It was heavily criticised by fans and critics, who noted that the decision to kill a queer character played into the 'bury your gays' trope present in many works of fiction, whereby more queer characters - and in particular lesbian, bisexual female and transgender characters - die compared to their straight cisgender counterparts. Luke Jennings - who penned the Codename Villanelle novels on which Killing Eve was based - later hit out at the ending in a piece for the Guardian. He wrote: 'The season four ending was a bowing to convention. A punishing of Villanelle and Eve for the bloody, erotically impelled chaos they have caused. A truly subversive storyline would have defied the trope which sees same-sex lovers in TV dramas permitted only the most fleeting of relationships before one of them is killed off. 'How much more darkly satisfying, and true to Killing Eve's original spirit, for the couple to walk off into the sunset together? Spoiler alert, but that's how it seemed to me when writing the books.' One of Killing Eve's writers Kayleigh Llewellyn also revealed the show was not originally due to finish with its fourth season.  All seasons of Killing Eve are available to stream now on BBC iPlayer.

Earlier this week BP reported profits of PS5bn the first three months of the year, its highest quarterly earnings in more than a decade. The company admitted it had 'more cash than we know what to do with'. Meanwhile voters are struggling with steep rises in energy bills, with Boris Johnson being confronted with stories of pensioners riding the bus all day just to keep warm. Labour has demanded the government impose a windfall tax on oil and gas companies in order to help people pay cope with the increase costs. But the prime minister has repeatedly rejected the suggestion. What is a windfall tax? A windfall tax is a one-off tax on a company or group of companies. It is so named as it targets excess profits the firms had not expected to make or were responsible for. In this case, oil and gas companies are raking in extra cash as a result of high energy prices in part due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. What does Labour say? Labour has proposed imposing a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas producers. Keir Starmer has said an extra 10 per cent should be added to their corporation tax bill for one year. Corporation tax is a tax companies have to pay the government on their profits. Labour has said the move would raise PS1.2bn, with the money used to save people PS600 on their bills. Starmer has made it the centre piece of his local election campaign, saying: 'The thing that has been keeping people up at night is worrying about paying their bills.'  What does the government say?  Boris Johnson has rebuffed calls from Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP for the tax. The prime minister has argued increasing taxes would 'stop investment' by oil and gas firms in the UK, especially in new green power that is needed to help wean the UK off Russian energy.  'We haven't invested enough in our own domestic energy and we need these big energy companies to step up to the plate and put their money into sustainable solutions, more green energy and to help keep costs down,' he told ITV this week.   'That is a much, much better solution than clobbering them and dissuading them, stopping them from making that investment.' There does however appear to be something of a cabinet split. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has hinted he is open to the idea. He told Mumsnet recently that a windfall tax was 'of course' something he would 'look at' if investments were not being made by firms. 'Nothing is ever off the table in these things,' he added.   But what do the oil firms say? Johnson's claim energy firms did 'not want' a windfall tax has also been undermined by none other than Bernard Looney, the chief executive of BP. He told The Times that a windfall tax would not stop any projects they currently have planned. 'There are none that we wouldn't do,' he said.", "dcc71031672e26e5272fe1c8eee02cd4571d920a6f78fdefcfc6c9df": "Anyone who has taken the tube in central London lately might be forgiven for thinking that Bridgerton star Jonathan Bailey was starring in a production of 'A Seriously Hot Ticket'. He's not, of course. He's actually been treading the boards in a production of Cock, but the title of the play has been removed from all ads on the London Underground, which kinda defeats the object of advertising the play if people don't actually know what it's called. Instead, the poster features Jonathan's name as well as that of his former co-star, Taron Egerton (who, to confuse matters further, withdrew from the production in April), alongside a photo of them both and a snippet of The Times review that reads 'A Seriously Hot Ticket'. The show's actual title has been censored by Transport for London (TFL), Variety reports. A TFL spokesperson told the US outlet: 'All advertising running on across the [TFL] estate needs to comply with both our own advertising policy and the Advertising Standards Authority's codes and rulings. Following advice from the Committee of Advertising Practice, the campaign was amended to ensure it was compliant.' The decision has been slammed by Cock producer Chris Harper, who said he was 'absolutely astounded' by the decision. 'It is 2022!' he said in a statement shared with Variety.  'The word is perfectly acceptable and has many meanings. Mike Bartlett's hilarious play, which is currently playing at the Ambassadors Theatre where the title is proudly displayed on the theatre, is a beautifully written piece which was inspired by a cockfight.' According to TFL's advertising policy, an ad will be deemed unacceptable if 'it is likely to cause widespread or serious offence to reasonable members of the public on account of the product or service being advertised, the content or design of the advertisement, or by way of implication,' and/or 'it could reasonably be seen as distasteful, indecent or obscene, in its use of imagery, language or otherwise.' Rocketman star Taron withdrew from his role in the play due to 'personal reasons' last month. The 32-year-old had been beset by difficulties since starting the run in March after fainting during the opening night and then later testing positive for Covid-19. He has since been replaced by his understudy Joel Harper-Jackson for the remainder of the run until 4 June.", "1b1519fcee6630bbe63280ada352c25a7d7cb9cc2afda217a6fb4fa7": "Russia is set to celebrate its national holiday Victory Day on Monday, and the West is worried that Vladimir Putin might use the occasion to declare all-out war. More than two months since the invasion of Ukraine, it's pretty clear that the Russian president's planned offensive has not gone entirely to plan.  The strength of the Ukrainian resistance has repeatedly stunned Russian forces, leaving them lacking morale and even functioning equipment. Meanwhile, the country's international reputation is in tatters as the war crime allegations mount. However, Putin has only increased his aggressive rhetoric and evidently has no intention to back down, even in the face of defeat. Now the highly symbolic Russian holiday Victory Day is just around the corner, is the Russian president about to take the barbaric war up a notch? What is Victory Day? Monday, May 9, will be the 77th anniversary of the Soviet Army's victory over the Nazis in 1945. It is always honoured as a national holiday and with a military parade through Moscow, while other celebrations take place across the country.  The director of the Russia-Eurasia Programme at Chatham House, James Nixey, told CNN: 'May 9 is designed to show off to the home crowd, to intimidate the opposition and to please the dictator of the time.' Warplanes have already been seen practising flying over Moscow's Red Square in the shape of the letter 'Z' - the pro-invasion symbol which has swept through Russia is recent weeks. The Kremlin is also allegedly trying to make the conquered Ukrainian city of Mariupol - which has been completely destroyed by Russian shelling - the 'centre of the celebrations', according to the Ukrainian defence intelligence agency. So why would Putin accelerate his plans on Monday? Victory Day is a very symbolic day in Russia, so it would make sense for the Russian president to choose this occasion to step up his acts of aggression. Putin has previously used the holiday to mobilise the nation for new battles and even laid the groundwork for tackling 'the ideology of the Nazis' last year. Russian state media has also suggested that the attacks on Ukraine are a continuation of the country's mission from World War 2, as Putin has falsely but repeatedly claimed that Nazis lead Ukraine. Defence secretary Ben Wallace warned last week that the Kremlin would see the national holiday as an excuse to champion greater violence against Ukraine. He told LBC Radio:'I would not be surprised [...] that he is probably going to declare on this May Day that 'we are now at war with the world's Nazis and we need to mass mobilise the Russian people'.' Wallace pointed out that Putin has 'failed in nearly all objectives' of the war, so 'may seek to consolidate what he's got' with a more aggressive declaration. However, Wallace did warn that he had no intelligence suggesting such an announcement was on the horizon, but said that was an educated guess based on Putin's previous comments. Russia is also on the cusp of being hit with an oil embargo from the EU, and is struggling under the weight of other Western sanctions - meaning he is likely to be looking for a quick win to unite the public under him. What might happen? So far, Putin has described the invasion of Ukraine as a 'special military operation', but he might use Victory Day to expand the scope of his aggression by declaring war on Nato for helping Ukraine. As Wallace pointed out: 'We have seen a number of statements from Putin about this becoming a war - 'this is a proxy war' - which it isn't - and 'Nazis are everywhere', basically, they are not just in Ukraine.' He continued: 'I think he will try to move from his 'special operation'. He's been rolling the pitch, laying the ground for being able to say, 'look this is now a war against Nazis and what I need is more people. I need more Russian cannon fodder'.' Wallace did point out though that he was not at all 'rattled' by Putin's threats towards Nato. A Kremlin spokesperson also said on Wednesday that there was 'no chance' he would declare war on the special occasion. However, Russia also continues to deny that it is at war with Ukraine. It also refused to admit it planned to invade its European neighbour right up until its troops crossed the country's borders on February 24. Alternatively, Putin could renew his vicious attacks on Ukraine and enact Russia's mobilisation law on Monday. This means the Kremlin may assemble more troops to help make up for the 15,000 troops lost through extending conscription, and calling in reservists. Martial law would then be announced to consolidate Putin's power at the helm of the country while men of fighting age would be prevented from leaving Russia. However, this is unlikely to be popular with the general public, and actually backfire, meaning Putin lost support for his attack on Ukraine. He could also put the country's economy on a war footing through full-scale mobilisation, or seek to consolidate Russia's few successes. To do this, he may annexe the breakaway Ukrainian territories of Lunhansk and Donetsk, push for the city of Odesa or declare full control over Mariupol. US State Department spokesman Ned Price said this week that there is 'good reason to believe that the Russians will do everything they can to use' the occasion for propaganda. 'We've seen the Russians really double down on their propaganda efforts, probably, almost certainly, as a means to distract from their tactical and strategic failures on the battlefield in Ukraine.' Could anything extra happen over the weekend? The Ministry of Defence has not predicted any further aggression to unfold over the weekend, even though Russia's ally Belarus always trains its troops en masse in May. In its daily update, the MoD explained: 'Russia will likely seek to inflate the threat posed to Ukraine by these exercises in order to fix Ukrainian forces in the North, preventing them from being committed to the battle for the Donbas.' However, it added that any 'threat to allies and partners' is not currently anticipated.", "1d9d6fc071f9aa6061121849f2d6b3c7d11d57ccbed7943680fa6f75": "Tipping Point host Ben Shephard has paid tribute to a contestant who died after filming an appearance on the show.

The Mayor of London conceded there was an 'equivalence' between the two events, but argued incidents repeatedly took place in Downing Street.  Starmer has struggled to shake off questions about a beer and curry he shared with up to 30 aides on an election visit to Durham last year.  The Labour leader has insisted he went back to work after stopping for the 10pm curry with colleagues during lockdown. However, critics point out a likeness between that and the prime minister and chancellor being issued with fines for a birthday cake shared in the Cabinet Room in 2020. Rishi Sunak was fined despite allegedly stumbling on the birthday gathering by accident while waiting to attend another meeting. Labour called for him to resign following the fine. Pressed on the equivalence between the two events, Khan told TalkTV's Tom Newton Dunn: 'I think you make a fair point. If there was one occasion where an instant happened in Downing Street, I think it's a fair point to say there's equivalence. 'We now know, though, there were many occasions and a culture versus one occasion having a bit of a curry at the end of a campaigning day.  'It's really important your listeners hear this, gathering for campaigning was allowed and what Keir Starmer was doing is not unreasonable, having supper is very different from a culture in Downing Street of 'bring your own bottle', having a karaoke machine and the police finding that in our prime minister, the rule maker, is a rule breaker as well.'  On the same programme Lib Dem leader Ed Davey defended Starmer, saying: 'The police have investigated what happened in Durham and haven't made any charges. They investigated what happened in 10 Downing Street and there were charges.'  Richard Holden, Tory MP for North West Durham, is leading efforts to get the police to re-examine the case after they found there had been no wrongdoing earlier this year. Social gatherings indoors were banned at the time but the Labour Party has insisted no laws were broken because Starmer and colleagues, including deputy leader Angela Rayner, were on a break and returned to work after they had eaten. Starmer accused the Tories of mud-slinging and said it was 'absurd' to suggest that people did not work after 10pm. He told the BBC: 'We stopped, we didn't break the rules, the police looked at it months ago. The rest of it is pure politics from the Conservative Party.'", "3f8cb90556adc03c47e9d8e6b1b2db73e8f5be68a96497663b995113": "A few students from nearby Central Saint Martins chat on the steps of the Queer Britain Museum, which is tucked away on one side of Granary Square in King's Cross, London, on the ground floor of a large 19th century building.  After years in the making, this is the UK's first permanent, national LGBTQ+ museum - and it's much needed. As the founders point out, queer people have impacted every part of culture, yet all too often their lives have been written in the margins of history books. This is a space for queer history to be 'preserved, explored and celebrated'. The museum itself is all on one floor, spread across three rooms, and opens with 'Welcome to Queer Britain' - a display showcasing artwork from the LGBTQ+ community alongside historical photographs. Once inside the fully-accessible threshold, the gift shop to the left is most immediately obvious. Laden with colourful memorabilia, it's got the usual staples: high-end chocolate, greetings cards and candles. But it's clear that this is an LGBTQ+ space: a table of books curated by the Gay's the Word bookshop sits in the centre, and there are plenty of rainbows - on badges, bottles and fridge magnets - plus Queer Britain's own branded merchandise. The museum comes after the successes of multiple temporary exhibitions in this area. Earlier this year, the Barbican held its Out and About! installation, exploring LGBTQ+ history in London, while last year, Museums & Galleries Edinburgh launched an online exhibition celebrating young Scottish LGBTQ+ people. Queer Britain will also not be the last: in June, another long-term LGBTQ+ cultural space in London will open, Queercircle in Greenwich. In fact, Queer's Britain's co-founder and director Joseph Galliano explains that it was while at another LGBTQ+ exhibition, the Tate Britain's Queer British Art, that his vision for a permanent museum really solidified. (Though, he had first had the idea as far back as 2007, when he was editor of Gay Times.) Held in 2017, the exhibit marked the 50th anniversary of the partial decriminalisation of male homosexuality. 'I was struck by the fact that so much momentum had been built up around that anniversary within the museums sector,' says Galliano. He spotted an 'opportunity to take that momentum, and broaden it' with his vision of a bricks-and-mortar museum truly reflective of the UK's LGBTQ+ community, including 'women's stories, people of colour, [and] trans people'. With that, Galliano set about putting Queer Britain into action, which he co-founded with Ian Mehrtens alongside a diverse committee of trustees and advisors, including Stonewall co-founder Lisa Power, Trans Britain author Christine Burns, and gal-dem founder Liv Little.  'We made sure that the leadership structures are very diverse,' adds Galliano. Of his hopes for the museum, trustee Krishna Omkar says in an email: 'Our relationship with our past defines our present, and helps direct what is to come. Telling stories that have remained untold, and collating a collective memory of the past is crucial. Representation matters. Remembrance matters.' In the first room, there are two large images: Sadie Lee's domineering oil painting of cabaret artist David Hoyle, whose eyes, shrouded in bright make-up, fixate on the viewer, plus Paul Harfleet's aptly-named Cock of the Rock, named after the South American bird. The second and largest room is split into two sections, the first dedicated to the topic of 'chosen family', originally shown by Queer Britain as a pop-up in collaboration with Levi's in 2019. For this, a series of bright images by four artists - Alia Romagnoli, Bex Day, Kuba Ryniewicz and Robert Taylor - show the diversity of the LGBTQ+ community, including people of colour and those of marginalised gender identities. Also in this room are a series of wide-ranging historical photographs, dating as far back as the 1870s. These cover various milestones in the UK's LGBTQ+ history, such as the introduction of Section 28 in 1988, which banned schools and local authorities from 'promoting' homosexuality, and the legalisation of equal marriage from 2014 in England, Wales and Scotland (followed by Northern Ireland in 2020). Among the imagery are notable figures including Leo Abse, the MP behind the bill that partially decriminalised homosexuality in 1967; TV presenter Sandi Toksvig; and Margeurite Radclyffe Hall, who wrote the classic lesbian novel The Well of Loneliness. The museum's opening comes during a time of increased visibility for LGBTQ+ people, with millions tuning in to watch Netflix's hit series Heartstopper. However, visibility and equality have not come hand-in-hand. Last December, it was reported that homophobic and transgender hate crimes soared in the summer of that year; in the five financial years up to 2021, anti-LGBTQ+ hate crimes rose annually, according to official Home Offices figures. The museum's theme is generally jubilant and celebratory, though, with little on the harrowing parts of LGBTQ+ history. For instance, while the AIDS epidemic is briefly referenced, including with a photograph of Princess Diana comforting an HIV-positive man, the museum does not delve into the sheer tragedy of the thousands of gay and bisexual men whose lives were lost during this crisis. A placard highlights the accomplishments of Justin Fashanu, the first openly gay professional footballer - and Britain's first black footballer to command a PS1 million transfer fee - with no mention of his tragic early death, at the age of 37 by suicide. For Galliano, it was a deliberate choice to focus on celebrating queer accomplishments, rather than the tragic parts. 'There is stuff there that needs to be celebrated, rather than just always starting with the sad ending,' he explains. 'That said we have to be telling hard stories and we have to be asking the hard questions.' Still, Galliano notes that displays may be adjusted depending on how they are received by the public. Since being registered as a charity in 2018, Galliano explains how Queer Britain has come up against multiple challenges, most notably financially. 'Funding was always a challenge from the start, [it] will always be a challenge,' he says. This is even more so given that entry to the museum is free, including for its exhibitions. 'If we're going to talk about inclusion, we need to talk about economic inclusion as well,' adds Galliano. The space, too, leased from the Art Fund, came up in January, which, says Galliano, was 'a year earlier than we were expecting...but it was too good an opportunity to not run full tilt', and so what is on display was pulled together quickly, in time for this Spring opening.  In July, Queer Britain will host its first exhibition, marking the 50th anniversary of the UK's first pride parade. Though Galliano is tight-lipped about its content, he says this will consist of a 'heritage items and community voices' which will also go towards 'addressing' representation of all four nations that make up the UK.  The current final room includes portraits from award-winning photographer Allie Crewe, which celebrate the trans and non-binary communities, and two images - both arresting and beautiful - donated by Robert Taylor, who is also a trustee of the museum. For Galliano, this museum is all about giving back to the queer community, alongside showing the richness - and diversity - of its history, not only to those who are LGBTQ+, but also to their heterosexual counterparts. 'I want queer people to feel celebrated, and belonging, and lifted up,' he says, 'and all their friends and families to recognise [where] their stories start and the importance of those.'

'It will take me a week to get my old man back on his feet again and I will be back.' Earlier this week, Sharon said the Black Sabbath star was now 'on the mend'.  The Talk airs weeknights at 9pm on TalkTV and YouTube.

The oil giant posted better-than-expected underlying earnings for the first three months of 2022, at 9.1 billion US dollars (PS7.2 billion) - nearly three times the 3.2 billion dollars (PS2.5 billion) reported a year earlier. On Tuesday, fellow FTSE 100 firm BP unveiled its highest quarterly underlying profits for more than a decade, at 6.2 billion US dollars (PS5 billion). It comes as calls mount from Labour and the Liberal Democrats for a windfall tax on oil and gas firms to help ease the cost-of-living crisis. The sector is reaping the benefits of rocketing oil and gas prices, which have been pushed to record levels by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and surging demand as economies emerge from the pandemic. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has so far resisted pressure to make the firms pay more tax, instead looking to companies making big profits to invest the cash back into the UK. Ed Miliband, Labour's shadow climate change and net zero secretary, said: 'Another day, another oil and gas company making billions in profits, and yet another day when the Government shamefully refuses to act with a windfall tax to bring down bills. 'Even the boss of BP has said that this will not impact investment. The Conservatives have run out of excuses, and been exposed for the political choice they are making by not acting. 'The truth is that the Government's priority is protecting oil and gas giants, not supporting the British people. And Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey condemned the Government's refusal to consider the move. He said: 'Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak's refusal to tax the super-profits of energy companies is completely unforgivable when people are too terrified to heat their homes. 'The excuses of Conservative ministers have been demolished by the boss of BP himself, who said a windfall tax wouldn't damage investment in the UK. 'This one-off levy would raise billions of pounds that could help vulnerable families with their energy bills now. It is a no-brainer.' Campaign group Greenpeace said a windfall tax would be the 'fastest and fairest way to ease pressure on households feeling the pinch and reduce our dependence on oil and gas'. Greenpeace UK's oil and gas campaigner, Philip Evans, said: 'By using a big chunk of the bloated profits that Shell, BP and others are raking in to make homes warmer, more energy-efficient and kitted out with heat pumps, the Government could start to really tackle the climate and cost-of-living crises simultaneously.' Like its FTSE 100 Index rival BP, Shell's figures also showed a hit from its move to pull out of Russia due to the Ukraine war as it booked a 3.9 billion dollar (PS3.1 billion) charge. Despite this, it still saw current cost of supply (CCS) earnings attributable to shareholders jump to 5 billion dollars (PS4 billion) in the quarter, up from 4.3 billion dollars (PS3.4 billion) a year ago, though it was down 38% on the previous three months. Shell said investor dividend payments and share repurchases hit 5.4 billion US dollars (PS4.3 billion) in the quarter, as part of a plan to buy back 8.5 billion US dollars (PS6.8 billion) of shares in the first half of 2022. It increased its dividend to 25 cents (20p) per share and said it also expects shareholder returns to be more than 30% of cashflow in the second half of 2022.", "be1b0d5cb726c273d5e8350d49d7888cf3103efa963c024a3c8b8327": "A former Conservative minister has revealed that he voted Labour at Thursday's local elections.  Nick Boles, a former MP for Grantham and Stamford who served as Boris Johnson's chief of staff while he was mayor of London, said he would be voting Labour for the first time since Tony Blair's 1997 general election landslide.  Boles tweeted: Boles served as a skills minister under David Cameron before going on to be a prominent backbencher critical of a no-deal Brexit. In April 2019, Boles resigned from the Tory party over what he called its 'refusal to compromise' over Brexit. Boles was one of a handful of MPs who had pushed for a Norway-style Common Market 2.0 soft Brexit which was ultimately rejected by the House.  Resigning in the Commons, Boles said: 'I have given everything to an attempt to find a compromise that can take this country out of the European Union while maintaining our economic strength and our political cohesion. 'I accept I have failed. I have failed chiefly because my party refuses to compromise.   'I regret therefore to announce I can no longer sit for this party.' Boles has also been a prominent critic of Johnson. In November 2019, he branded the prime minister a 'compulsive liar' who has betrayed 'every woman who has ever loved him' and revealed he would be voting for the Lib Dems at the general election.  Boles did not contest his seat in the 2019 general election, which is now represented by Tory MP Gareth Davies.

The Hollywood star arrived by helicopter, which then landed onto a US aircraft carrier, during an epic red-carpet arrival at the star-studded first showing of the reboot of the 1986 classic. Despite being able to fly the chopper in question, the actor admitted that someone else was in the cockpit on this occasion.  'No, not today. I do fly that helicopter, but not today,' he said after after touching down and stepping out onto the USS Midway carrier in San Diego, California. The actor said it had been a case of 'now or never' when discussing plans for the sequel, which comes 36 years after the release of the original aviation blockbuster. Due to be released in cinemas on 27 May, the sequel sees Tom reprise the role of US naval aviator Pete Mitchell. Other stars include Miles Teller, Jennifer Connelly, Monica Barbaro, Val Kilmer, Jon Hamm and Glen Powell. 'This moment right here, getting to see everyone, no masks. This is pretty epic,' he said, speaking to Deadline at the event. 'It was really now or never, it was a moment, we were looking at how to tell this story... I've been thinking about it and figuring it out. 'I thought if we're going to go in, we have to go in now.' He added: 'Of course (Top Gun) is this great summer experience, and what it became to audiences and generations is something I could never have imagined at the time we were making it. 'But it's a drama at its heart and it has that kind of storytelling that I cut my teeth on, that I love seeing with these characters. 'The movie means a lot to me, a lot to my career, a lot to the studio and a lot to audiences.' Tom provided his cast members with a rigorous training programme in preparation for the film, including real-life jet plane flying lessons. 'This cast is amazing, they're unbelievable these guys... they're a very talented group,' he said. The actor was praised by his co-stars as a 'mentor and friend' who 'cares that everybody wins'. 'Tom Cruise doesn't half-arse anything,' said Glen Powell, who plays Hangman in the film. 'Without Tom on this movie being our flight instructor, our mentor, our friend, there is no way we could pull this off. 'Tom is Maverick in real life, he's as cool as it gets. 'The thing that makes him special is that he cares that everybody wins. You watch this movie and every single character in the movie wins, everyone looks cool. 'It's never about him, it's about the end product.' Jon Hamm, who plays Vice, paid tribute to Tom's 'unparalleled work ethic'. 'He's the first guy on set and he's the last guy to leave. He works every day and he works harder than everybody,' he told Deadline. 'His enthusiasm for film-making, especially a film like this that he has such a rich history with, is infectious.' Top Gun: Maverick was originally due for release in July 2019 but was repeatedly pushed back due to the coronavirus pandemic.", "053143f3d6d08b3dcea74ce4abfeb0f900aaf3cc07aed864efc0eeb7": "Kim Kardashian's love for Marilyn Monroe just hit a whole new level.  Before the The Kardashians star rocked the late blonde bombshell's iconic 'Happy Birthday, Mr. President' dress to the 2022 Met Gala, she was gifted a lock of Monroe's hair from the Ripley's Believe It or Not! headquarters in Orlando, Florida.  During her Met Gala dress fitting, the museum team surprised Kim with a silver box containing actual strands of Monroe's legendary platinum hair. The reality star wasn't shy about revealing her bizarre plans for Monroe's tresses.  'Oh, my God, I'm literally going to do some crazy voodoo shit [to] channel her,' the reality star said in the video. 'This is so special to me. Thank you so much. This is so cool.' 'Wow, this is sleeping with me every night,' Kim added, turning to boyfriend Pete Davidson. 'Sorry, babe.' The Ripley's team also filled her Met Gala dressing room with an array of Marilyn Monroe and JFK memorabilia to make sure the fashionista had ample inspiration for her look. Kim confessed, however, that fitting into the dress was no easy task - she had to lose 16 pounds in three weeks. 'I would wear a sauna suit twice a day, run on the treadmill, completely cut out all sugar and all carbs, and just eat the cleanest veggies and protein,' she told Vogue on the red carpet. 'I didn't starve myself, but I was so strict.' Kim marked only the second time in history that the famous garment has been tried on, according to an Instagram post from Ripley's museum. 'The dress was transported by guards and I had to wear gloves to try it on,' she said. The American franchise that specialises in showcasing oddities captured Kim's emotional moment as she tried on the dress that had been preserved as a piece of pop culture history.  The problem was the dress wouldn't fully zip over her frame.  The museum had to consult with garment conservationists, appraisers and archivists to figure out the best way to preserve the condition of the dress since alterations could not be made to the gown.  In order to make it work, Kim wore a white, vintage fur coat that draped over the zipper, which was only partially fastened.  She didn't change into the dress until she was ready to stroll the red carpet, she said. She left her hotel on Monday in just a fitting gown and changed into the historic dress in a small room at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. After the initial big reveal on the red carpet, she changed into a replica dress to protect the piece of history. She then celebrated her three weeks of dieting by throwing a donut and pizza party in her hotel room.  On Monday night, she shared videos on her Instagram story showcasing the mini donut station and slew of pizza boxes on a table in her room.  'You guys, I haven't had carbs or sugar in almost a month,' she said. 'Definitely three weeks. This pizza -- I'm so excited!' Despite enduring disapproval from critics for endangering the gown by borrowing it, the head of Monroe's estate, Nick Woodhouse, sounded off his approval. He told TMZ he and his partners believe Monroe would have celebrated Kim's fashion tribute, citing similarities between the two icons.", "dfd478b290c3d1283a2c514bf590c85ddfd822e949de09a2aac063b5": "Kim Cattrall has broken her silence on the Sex And The City reboot And Just Like That, revealing that she was never asked to be a part of the series and that she found out about it through social media. The British-born actor starred as Samantha Jones in the original six series of the show, which ran from 1998 to 2004, as well as two feature films released in 2008 and 2010. The reboot sees Sarah Jessica Parker return as New York City columnist Carrie Bradshaw, Cynthia Nixon as Miranda Hobbes and Kristin Davis as Charlotte York. In an interview with Variety, Kim said she was not approached to reprise her character as she had previously made her 'feelings clear' after she turned down a script for a possible third movie in 2017. 'The series is basically the third movie. That's how creative it was,' she said. 'I was never asked to be part of the reboot. I made my feelings clear after the possible third movie, so I found out about it like everyone else did -- on social media.' Samantha had been written into the script for the potential third movie, which would have seen her receive unwanted 'dick pics' from Brady, Miranda's 14-year-old son - a storyline she described as 'heartbreaking'. Remarking that it was an 'understatement' to say her character wasn't progressing, Kim went on to offer what she believed to be a more compelling storyline. 'Why can't Samantha, who owns her PR company -- maybe she had to sell it because of financial woes? 2008 was tough,' she said. 'I mean that's a scenario that was kind of off the top of one of my reps' heads, and I thought that's a great idea. That's a conflict. Instead of an underage boy's...' 'I would have preferred for all of us to have some kind of event to warrant a third film. That didn't happen. But also, I was ready,' she added. 'As difficult as it was, and as scary as it is to stand up and not be bullied by the press or the fans or whomever -- to just say, I'm good. I'm on this track. It was so great working with you. I so enjoyed it, but I'm over here.' Kim also admitted that she had not watched the new 10-part series, which debuted earlier this year. Reflecting on why she closed the door on playing Samantha, she said: 'It's a great wisdom to know when enough is enough. 'I also didn't want to compromise what the show was to me. The way forward seemed clear.' Despite Kim's physical absence from the reboot, her character lives on in the series -- with Carrie communicating with Samantha via text throughout the season -- which Kim said was 'odd' and 'feels different than the Samantha that I played.' The show also depicted a dissolution of the pair's friendship after Samantha was apparently dropped as Carrie's publicist, prompting Samantha to move to London. For years there have been reports of a real-life rift between Kim and SJP, with some concluding this influenced her departure. Discussing her relationship with her Sex And The City co-stars, Kim said: 'I think we were colleagues. My colleagues aren't my friends. It was professional.' She admitted she found it 'odd' that she was still referenced in the latest storyline, but said knowing fans wanted more of her was a 'really wonderful feeling'. She added: 'That feels powerful, that I've left something behind that I'm so proud of. I loved her. I loved her so, so, so much. 'It's tough competition. The original show is in all of our imaginations. But for me, it feels clean.' She added that parts of her character, who became beloved by millions of fans for her sex-positive and ambitious attitude, remain with her and she feels 'ultimately protective of her'. Kim has since appeared in the new How I Met Your Father TV series as well as a reboot of 1999 series Queer As Folk.", "2b525e86482fd838574e25a35061efdc744841d00340384ea518a97b": "Since 1973, Roe v. Wade has protected the right of all Americans to access safe and legal abortions. But a leaked document published by Politico on Monday shows that the federal protections conferred by Roe may be struck down by the US Supreme Court this summer.  If Roe falls, the legality of abortion will be determined by each state. And though a handful of states are passing legislation that will protect the right to get an abortion, many others -- 26 to be exact -- are expected to quickly ban or restrict abortions.  If this happens, millions of people in the US will no longer be able to access safe abortion care within their communities. They'll have to wait longer and travel farther to access help. The impact on people's mental and physical health - along with their finances, families and livelihoods - will be astronomical.  Despite the misinformation that swirls around the internet (and beyond), abortions are extremely safe procedures. They're also incredible common - about one in four women will have an abortion by the time they are 45 - and, in many cases, they are life-saving.  'It is a common procedure, it is very safe, and I can't emphasise that enough. This draft ruling is egregious, it is a basically a war against women,' Dr. Melissa Simon, a Northwestern Medicine OB/GYN, tells HuffPost.  Here's what people get wrong about abortion One of the most common misconceptions about abortions is that the procedure is dangerous or detrimental to one's health.  A report from 2018 examined the safety of various methods of abortion - medication, aspiration, dilation and evacuation, and induction - and concluded that abortions are safe and effective and that complications from all types of abortions are rare.  It's the barriers and restrictions that legislators sign to prevent patients from easily and swiftly accessing abortion that jeopardise their health. It's well known that delaying abortion care increases the risk of complications.  Some US states require doctors to tell their patients that there's a link between breast cancer and abortion - despite the fact that many high-quality studies have put this question to rest, according to Dr. Jennifer Kerns, an associate professor in the department of obstetrics, gynaecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco.  Others fear that abortions cause infertility, but research hasn't found a link between abortions and the ability to conceive in the future. There's also no evidence that abortions increase the risk of complications (ie. preterm birth or low birth weight delivery) in the event of a future pregnancy. Another long-running mistruth is that abortions increase the risk of developing mental health issues. 'There is a huge body of work demonstrating that abortion in and of itself does not cause mental health problems,' Kerns says, noting that people often feel relief after getting an abortion.  What we do know is that unwanted pregnancies can cause significant maternal depression and parenting stress. And those mental health issues don't clear up with time; they are often long-lasting, afflicting the women who carried the unwanted pregnancies to term well into their 30s, 40s and 50s.  Many people falsely believe pregnancy is easy to avoid, but it's not that straightforward. Kerns sees many people, from all walks of life and phases of reproductive health, seeking an abortion. Contraception - though invaluable - is not foolproof. Birth control is not 100% effective; it can fail and lead to a pregnancy.  'Even in the setting of using contraception and safe-sex practices, having the option of an abortion is critical to the life and both physical and mental health of the woman,' Simon says.  Many anti-abortion bills have been labelled 'heartbeat bills' because they ban abortions at the first sign of foetal cardiac activity. This nomenclature is wildly misleading - while primordial electrical activity can be detected around six weeks of pregnancy, this does not mean a foetus has a functioning heart. The heart, valves and vessels do not form until 16-18 weeks of pregnancy.  'Just having cardiac activity does not mean the foetus, if born at that moment, would be able to survive,' Simon says.  Restricting abortion impacts people's health and livelihoods Evidence shows that being denied an abortion has a devastating impact on one's physical health, mental health and overall well-being.  The Turnaway Study, conducted by scientists at the University of California, San Francisco, found that women who carry an unwanted pregnancy to term have a four times greater chance of being below the US federal poverty level. They're also more likely to experience serious health complications, such as eclampsia and death, and to develop mental health issues, including anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation. They're more likely to stick with an abusive partner; their life goals tend to take a back seat, and their families' livelihoods suffer. Many go on to experience chronic pain.  'The health and welfare of the citizens of this country suffer - we see increased illness, we see increased poverty and we see increased death,' Kerns says.  Restricting the right to an abortion does not mean the need for an abortion disappears. A recent study predicted that banning abortion will lead to a 21% increase in pregnancy-related deaths; that jumps to 33% among Black women. Maternal mortality rates are at an all-time high. The US already has the highest maternal death rate among developed nations -- and that crisis would only get worse without access to safe abortion.   'There are some women who get pregnant who could die if they continue with the pregnancy, and, therefore, an abortion is a life-saving procedure in those circumstances,' says Simon, adding that those circumstances are not rare. Abortions, in many cases, can save the life of the mother.  Here's what the fall of Roe could mean for health care Kerns said the leaked document demonstrates that the court is no longer a neutral group. 'It really lays bare how out of touch their rulings are with people's lives,' Kerns said.  Much of the language used in abortion restrictions and bans - like 'abortionists' - really deeply divides people and shames those who get an abortion or provide an abortion.  Simon says the potential fall of Roe reflects a crisis in women's health care, specifically when it comes to maternal health. The end of Roe would mark a war against women and people who can get pregnant, who, for the record, comprise over 50% of the US population, she adds.  Simon is exceedingly concerned about what will happen to the growing maternal death rate if Roe falls and safe abortion care becomes harder and harder to access.  'That is what I am very worried about in this country - that we are going to go even more in the wrong direction than we already are with respect to caring for over half of our population: women,' Simon says.

The topic of porn can be a taboo subject, but we need to talk about it - especially in relationships. This week's reader, Jenny, wrote in to ask for advice related to her husband's porn consumption.  'My partner is watching porn and won't have sex with me,' she said. 'I found out that my husband is into porn and he won't turn from his ways. He's pleasuring himself but won't have sex with me, what should I do?' Navigating a situation like this can be tricky, but Counselling Directory member Georgina Smith is here to help.  How can this reader speak to her husband about this? 'Like any difficult subject in a relationship, pick a time when you are both able to talk freely, raising it when you are both calm and able to discuss rationally, don't wait until an argument,' Smith says. 'Invite some open conversation about his feelings around his porn habit and how that makes you feel - try to use empathy and good listening skills. 'Explore how you could find your way back to a sex life you both enjoy to feel more connected. You are entitled to express your desire for sex in a relationship and how their rejection may be causing you hurt.' When does watching porn become an issue in a relationship? Smith believes that watching porn in a relationship becomes an issue when it causes harm to the partner. 'Some people perceive watching porn as a form of infidelity, especially if it is done in secret,' she says. 'If porn watching is essentially a substitution for actual sex and that is impacting on the relationship (by stopping a couple connecting via sex and intimacy), I would consider that to be an issue. 'If watching porn has become addictive (i.e. unable to stop even if viewer wants to stop) then that person may need specialist help.' What should we do when porn becomes an issue in our relationship? Smith emphasises that we should 'communicate effectively around the subject, don't avoid it just because it can sometimes be an uncomfortable conversation.' 'Try to understand where you are both coming from if you have opposing views around porn and figure out how you might find a common ground that keeps both of you happy,' Smith says. 'Get some couple counselling to unpack in a safe space and reflect individually why you feel the way you do about porn would be two helpful places to start.'

But in child psychology, based on the work of Diana Baumrind, a developmental psychologist, experts point to four main parenting styles - neglectful, authoritarian, authoritative and permissive - that influence how children grow and interact.  'Without a lot of intentional thought, parenting styles are often a combination of learned instincts gained from a parent's own experience, temperament and role models,' says Rachel Robertson, vice president of education at Bright Horizons. 'It doesn't mean a parent is stuck with whatever style comes most naturally to them, if it isn't ideal.' She emphasises parents can fluctuate between styles depending on the situation - and by having awareness and intention can make thoughtful choices and create habits that will help them raise their kids the way they want.  'Simply being aware of effective parenting strategies can help a parent pause and act purposefully in a moment they may have otherwise acted instinctually or emotionally,' Robertson explains. 'Parenting is an in-the-moment kind of activity but it also is really about the long game - parents are raising human beings who we all hope grow to be contributing citizens, future leaders, lifelong learners and stewards of the future they will inherit.' HuffPost spoke with Robertson and family therapist Kelly Oriard to break down the four parenting styles and how each approach affects children.  Neglectful ''[Neglectful] style is hands-off and uninvolved,' Robertson says. 'This style may be intentional or unintentional, depending on the parent. Communication, interaction and involvement in activities is limited.' To better understand neglectful parenting and the other three styles, it's important to consider emotional climate, which is basically the overall mood and perception of a family and the relationship dynamics within it. 'For children, emotional climate, especially a warm emotional climate, is your caregiver wanting to be involved with your interests, supporting you, cheering you on and being responsive to your needs,' says Oriard, who is a co-founder of Slumberkins, an educational brand focused on emotional learning. 'It can look like snuggling up to read their favourite story or supporting them after something didn't quite go their way.' In the neglectful parenting style, there's low emotional warmth, as this type of caregiver tends to have low levels of interaction with their child.  'When disciplining, these parents tend to choose harsher techniques and offer little to no explanation,' Oriard says. 'This parent is like the boss who you barely see at work. You end up learning on the fly and figuring it out because direction and interaction is minimal. Then if you do make a mistake because of the low level of direction, your boss becomes enraged and takes it out on you in front of your peers and higher-ups.' She noted that this type of boss would not circle back or touch base with you, might dismiss you on the spot and may leave you feeling anxious about making future mistakes. A neglectful parent can leave similar negative feelings.  'Unfortunately, children who have neglectful-uninvolved parents tend to have numerous problems as they grow up,' Oriard says. 'These children may have mental health struggles related to depression and anxiety, they may have poor social skills and can even be prone to future substance abuse.' Authoritarian 'Authoritarian parents expect children to listen, follow directions and obey,' Robertson says. 'This style is considered to be strict and a disciplinarian. There is a lack of flexibility and high expectation of compliance.' Similar to the neglectful parenting style, authoritarian parenting involves low emotional warmth, but what makes it different is a high level of demand and control - terms that refer to the extent to which parents try to control their child's behaviour and development. 'We all want our children to be accepted and liked and part of that is helping them to navigate social norms,' Oriard says. 'When demandingness and control become problematic is when adults take an adult-centred approach and try to control their child for their benefit instead of for the betterment of the child.' She notes that the authoritarian style's combination of low emotional warmth and high demandingness can feel particularly strict and cold. 'Without the emotional support, these kids can struggle socially and suffer from mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression,' Oriard explains. 'This is due to the fact that high demandingness without a warm emotional climate can create an environment that is not only about behavioural control but psychological control. Psychological control is much harsher and uses shame and guilt to manipulate the child or coerce the child into doing what the caregiver wants or expects of them.' Under her office analogy above, this scenario is like having a boss who only cares about productivity and goals and is relentless about how they achieve those goals. This boss doesn't seem to care about the employee as a person and fosters a cold, harsh and restrictive environment. Authoritative 'Authoritative parents set clear expectations and provide structure and routine but remain flexible,' Robertson says. 'There is a clear parent-child dynamic, but children are respected, listened to and given choices. Authoritative parents are nurturing and reliable.' Research indicates that the authoritative style is the most beneficial for children's development and thus the style to strive for as a parent. It's about creating a warm emotional climate coupled with a healthy, moderate-to-high level of demandingness and control.  'This is the boss that we all love working for,' Oriard says. 'This boss is in the office and is friendly and welcoming to all of their employees. They know that Suzy fell off her bike last week and checked in to see how she was doing. This boss has high expectations of all their employees but communicates this openly and is willing to discuss trying things in a different way if you feel like it would help you.' For children, an authoritative parent is supportive, responsive and nurturing. They are kind, caring and loving but also set firm limits and have high expectations. They explain their reasoning and listen to their child's viewpoint, even if they don't indulge it. 'When high expectations are coupled with a warm emotional climate, kids are better able to thrive,' Oriard says. 'While neglectful-uninvolved parenting leads to numerous negative outcomes, authoritative parenting is known as the style that creates the most positive outcomes for children.' Permissive 'Permissive parents are warm and loving, but this style is without a lot of rules or structure,' Robertson notes. 'Sometimes this parent would be described as more of a friend relationship than parental. There is a lot less direction or expectation and children are given a lot of autonomy and a voice in most decisions. If rules are set, they are often unenforced.' Permissive parenting involves a warm emotional climate but low demandingness and control. 'If their child hits your child on the playground, they do not jump up to correct the behaviour, they just let it go and chalk it up to kids being kids,' Oriard says. 'In the office, this is the boss who doesn't exactly know what is up. They don't have a lot of demands and let you do your own thing. If you mess up a huge project, it's fine. No worries. You yelled at your client over the phone? Not a problem.' She noted that children of permissive parents tend to have behavioural issues and struggle socially.  'They might also struggle a bit at school or in environments where there are rules to follow,' Oriard adds.  Like the other styles, this one isn't fixed. There are practical ways to make changes to move away from a less effective style and more toward an authoritative style. 'If a parent tends to be more permissive and have informal schedules or unpredictability in routine, this can be tricky for children as they use routines and schedules to learn about the patterns of the day, what to expect, how to feel secure and what can be relied on,' Robertson says. 'A permissive parent can start by creating a consistent bedtime routine, knowing this will help their child's development.' Still, even the best of parents won't be authoritative 100% of the time.

Through a $50 million lawsuit, Depp is accusing his ex-wife of lying about her abuse allegations, made over the course of the couple's acrimonious split in 2016, when she sought a restraining order against him.  The Pirates of the Caribbean star testified last month, alleging that Heard had actually abused him during their relationship, in one incident by throwing a glass bottle that shattered and severed his fingertip. He has repeatedly denied all accusations of abuse. Wednesday was the first time the court was able to learn directly from Heard how Depp allegedly used his money and charm to cover up shocking behaviour. Heard described a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde scenario where Depp -- who has spoken candidly about his struggles with alcohol and drug addiction -- would sometimes show warmth, but sometimes be 'this other thing'.  'And that other thing was [an] awful, awful thing that would come out and take over, and it was hard to see the Johnny I loved underneath it. And no one told him. No one was honest with him,' Heard testified, referring to the people who managed Depp's career. 'He'd pass out in his own vomit, he'd lose control of his body, and everybody would clean up after him. I cleaned up after him,' she said, adding that she once saw Depp's bodyguards change him out of soiled pants. Heard told of a bizarre situation in which she was driving with Depp to an event and, along the way, the actor allegedly grabbed a teacup Yorkie and held it out the window of the moving vehicle while 'howling'. Despite there being other, unnamed people in the car, Heard said, no one reacted.  She became emotional during her hours of testimony, at times speaking haltingly. Depp looked down at the table in front of him much of the time; he appeared to be writing. The actors were married briefly in 2015 and 2016, having met on the set of the 2011 film The Rum Diary, which starred Depp. Asked to describe the first time Depp struck her, Heard began by telling the court that Depp had been drinking and, she suspected, using cocaine, since there was a 'vintage jar' of the drug nearby.  'He slapped me across the face, and I laughed. I laughed. Because I didn't know what else to do. I thought this must be a joke. This must be a joke because I didn't know what was going on,' Heard testified. 'He said, 'You think it's so funny? You think it's funny, bitch? You think you're a funny bitch?' And he slapped me again,' she said. Depp allegedly struck her a third time, causing her to lose her balance. Earlier in the trial, recordings were played of Depp screaming at Heard and calling her names. 'I knew it was wrong, and I had to leave him,' Heard said of the alleged assault. 'And that's what broke my heart, because I didn't want to leave him.' Then Depp started crying, Heard testified, and assuring her on his knees that he would never hit her again. Depp spoke about his addiction issue as if it were a 'monster' that he killed, saying he thought he had 'put that fucker away', according to Heard. At various times, she said that Depp hit her and broke things near her, appearing upset about the idea that Heard could be seeing other people. Heard said Depp took issue with low-cut clothing, commenting: 'That's really what you're wearing, kid?' She described a pattern in which Depp would 'blow up' and then 'disappear', returning after he had sobered up. Later in their relationship, Heard said that Depp started hiding his alcohol and drug use from her, leaving her to make educated guesses about the state he was in. 'Johnny on speed is very different from Johnny on opiates. And Johnny on opiates [is] very different from Johnny on Adderall, and Cocaine Johnny, which is very different from Quaaludes Johnny,' Heard said.  In one particularly horrific episode, Heard alleged that Depp became irate one night, ripped her dress partially off, groped her body and 'proceeded to do a cavity search.' 'He said he was looking for his drugs, his cocaine, his coke,' she said. The alleged incident took place at an isolated 'trailer park' retreat that had been rented, and when the manager took a look at the damage Depp had supposedly done to the place, Heard said he was angry -- until speaking to Depp, who smoothed things over. She is expected to resume testimony on Thursday.", "c6cd167bab18c0d9c641dee4d04d76419ae723212b4541d7dfbba35b": "If the polls have it right, Northern Ireland could be on the brink of seismic change.  Ever since the Protestant-majority state was found a century ago after the republic of Ireland's independence from Britain, its governments have been led by unionist politicians who defined themselves as British. But one recent survey had Sinn Fein, the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), with an 8-point advantage ahead of Thursday's election for the Northern Ireland Assembly. If the Irish nationalist party which seeks union with Ireland comes out on top for the first time in the province, it would represent an historic shift 24 years after the Good Friday peace agreement ended three decades of sectarian bloodshed. Sinn Fein, once a political pariah, would be closer to becoming the lead party in government on both sides of the Irish border, and the debate around Northern Ireland withdrawing from the United Kingdom of England, Scotland and Wales would intensify. Who are Sinn Fein? The party has long been linked to the IRA, a paramilitary group that used bombs and bullets to try to take Northern Ireland out of UK rule during decades of violence. But Sinn Fein in 2022 is led by a younger generation of politicians with fewer links to the IRA and Northern Ireland's Troubles, when 3,600 people were killed. A milestone triumph at Stormont this week shouldn't come as a surprise, as Sinn Fein was just one seat behind the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), the biggest pro-British party, in 2017. The party is also well placed to win elections in the republic of Ireland, which are due by 2025.  United Ireland downplayed While a united Ireland is Sinn Fein's over-arching aim, the issue has not been central to its campaign efforts. Instead, and in common with most elections set against the cost of living crisis, the focus has been on bread-and-butter issues. Constitutional goals are so little mentioned that Irish unity takes up just one page in the 17-page manifesto. Michelle O'Neill, the party's leader in Northern Ireland, said during a televised election debate she was not 'fixated on a date' for a unification referendum. 'The things that the public want us to respond to is trying to put money in their pockets to help them deal with the cost-of-living crisis,' she said. How would it work? If Sinn Fein does make history, it could trigger a constitutional crisis. Under Northern Ireland's power-sharing system, created by the 1998 peace agreement that ended decades of Catholic-Protestant conflict, the jobs of first minister and deputy first minister are split between the biggest unionist party and the largest nationalist one. Both posts must be filled for a government to function. The DUP, which has been the largest in the Northern Ireland Assembly for two decades, has suggested it might not serve under a Sinn Fein first minister. The new elected politicians will meet next week to try to form an executive. If none can be formed within six months, the administration will collapse, triggering a new election and more uncertainty. Is Brexit an issue?  Brexit bolstered the case for a united Ireland after a majority in Northern Ireland voted to remain in the European Union, and the controversy over post-Brexit customs and border checks on some goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK has prompted anger. The arrangement was designed to maintain an open border between Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland, a key pillar of the peace process. But unionists say the new checks have created a barrier between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK that undermines their British identity. The instability has led to rising tensions and sporadic violence. The DUP also says it will refuse to join a new government unless there are major changes to the post-Brexit border arrangements under the Northern Ireland Protocol. DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson said during the TV debate: 'The political institutions must be sustainable. And that means we have got to deal with the big issues that are in front of us, not least the harm that the Northern Ireland Protocol is doing to undermine political stability in Northern Ireland.' Changing politics in Northern Ireland Voting along strict tribal lines is crumbling as more support is going to parties that identify as neither nationalist nor unionist, with young people increasingly rejecting the traditional labels. A collapse in support over the last 18 months for the DUP has paved the way for Sinn Fein to take the office of first minister, and polls showed that even the cross-community Alliance Party could catch the DUP - an unthinkable prospect five years ago. Anger over the post-Brexit checks is set to spilt the unionist vote share more widely this time compared to 2017. Nonetheless, pro-British parties are using Sinn Fein's push to withdraw Northern Ireland from the UK, and a potentially divisive border poll, to galvanise support. Is re-unification inevitable? The immediate effects of a Sinn Fein victory are likely be symbolic, and there's very little certainty about any path towards a united Ireland. Even if Sinn Fein were to win in the Republic, there could be problems forming a government there too. What's more, nationalists with the upper hand on both sides of the border could deter less hardline voters from backing re-unification.  It is also solely up to the British government under the terms of the 1998 peace deal to call a referendum if they believe a 'yes' majority looks likely. Opinion polls have consistently shown most voters in Northern Ireland favour the status quo. But it's not inconceivable to think a united Ireland could soon become as dominant an issue as independence is in Scotland, and the future of a United Kingdom is put in great doubt.", "608443f7a7b8908e378be691b2759074e7177e74ead49d8ed9eb9b40": "", "f737a3b8519f5c6a1567f79af04986e5a992033dc8ad24181bfbcff1": "Downing Street's partygate scandal has been a godsend for Labour ever since it broke at the end of last year. Barely a week has gone by without further developments in the scandal over lockdown-busting parties in and around Number 10. Boris Johnson's personal poll ratings have tumbled, as have the Tories', as voters vent their anger. Even Rishi Sunak has lost his shine after being issued with a Metropolitan Police fine for attending a birthday bash for the prime minister in the Cabinet Room on June 19, 2020. But that invaluable political capital gifted to Labour now risks being squandered as Keir Starmer finds himself fending off his own allegations of breaking covid laws. It has also raised questions about the Labour leader's ability to get himself out of a tight spot when pursued aggressively by the tabloid media. The timing could not have been worse for Starmer, with voters across the UK going to the polls tomorrow. When a grainy photo of Starmer drinking a bottle of beer while campaigning in Durham first emerged a year ago, it was met with little fanfare. Starmer explained he and his team had paused to have a takeaway before getting back to work. Confirmation from Durham Police that they were satisfied no rules were broken appeared to suggest it was case closed. But a drip feed of new details -- including that up to 30 people may have been in attendance and that a PS200 Indian takeaway was ordered at 9pm -- threatens to make Labour's attacks on the Tories redundant, given the charges of hypocrisy and double standards that have inevitably followed. Party sources have also expressed frustration at the way the story has been handled, citing Starmer's refusal earlier this week to answer basic questions on whether Durham Police had spoken to him. Labour later confirmed that they had not. One party insider told HuffPost UK that they believed Lynton Crosby, Johnson's Australian poll guru, was 'eating Keir alive' over what the right-wing press have dubbed 'beergate'. 'Lynton Crosby is behaving like a fox in the hen house, smashing Labour's amateur and out-of-depth comms operation all over his Belgravia tennis court,' they said. 'It's classic Crosby -- kill your opponent's cat and throw it in their face. 'Labour now looks exactly the same as the Tories, and cannot get their message across days before the local elections.' Another source suggested the party needed to go harder and be clearer about the difference between Starmer's situation and the No.10 parties being investigated by the Metropolitan Police. 'We had a curry and a beer while we were working, they wheeled in a suitcase of booze and held a mock press conference where they joked about their wine and cheese party,' they said. 'We were working, they were on the lash while loved ones died without their families around them. 'It's completely different and the only reason anyone is trying to say anything different is because the Conservative Party don't want to talk about why people can't pay their bills. 'Keir should go for them -- but that sort of attack just isn't his strong suit. 'This is the Tory political operation - create a stench of wrongdoing even if there isn't one, and that will keep the real issues off the table.' When HuffPost UK spoke to Starmer about beergate while on the campaign trail, he made clear he felt no rules had been broken. 'We were working in the office, it was a few days before the election, we paused for food, carried on,' he said. 'No breach of the rules, no party, the police looked at it months ago and decided there was nothing wrong, and that's the long and the short of it.' What makes Labour's headache worse is the unambiguous stance it has taken towards Met Police fines.  After Johnson and Sunak were slapped with fixed penalty notices, Starmer called for both of them to go. Sunak has, by some, been seen as hard-done by, given that by his account, he stumbled on the birthday gathering by accident while waiting to attend another meeting. If Starmer believes that demands a resignation, then his beer in Durham would most likely warrant his too. Some allies believe Starmer's reputation as a former director of public prosecutions will ultimately help reinforce his reputation as law maker and not a law breaker. While Johnson has a reputation for playing fast and loose with the truth, Starmer is known for his seriousness. 'Keir was upfront when he said it was just mudslinging,' one ally said. 'He was DPP -- he is not going to actively bend any rules or laws. The police haven't been in touch. 'Keir was saying, in a very legalistic sense, that the case has been closed.' Voters will decide on Thursday whether they share the same verdict -- or whether this latest episode confirms the suspicion that all politicians are the same.", "4fc625ea076a15806619a4272aebc117012fe7ac520485c06e505112": "The BBC launched a 'Deprivation Study' to find out how people felt without the national service - and the outcome, published on Tuesday, just might deter its critics. The broadcaster commissioned the study from researchers MTM following uproar over its licence fee, which the culture secretary Nadine Dorries recently froze for two years. This means the levy will not rise with inflation (which is at a 30-year high) and so the institution is facing a PS2 billion funding cut. The government has also floated the idea of scrapping the licence fee altogether. To uncover how the general public actually feel about the institution, this new research took 80 households and deprived them of BBC content for nine days (including two weekends). This meant no TV and radio, recipes, podcasts, or access to social media platforms linked the broadcaster. After their hiatus, the participants were handed an envelope with the value of that nine days of content - it worked out to be less than PS4. The BBC licence fee is PS159 per year, or PS53.50 for black and white TVs. The study was meant to 'uncover the value of the BBC to households in the competitive media environment' of 2020 and 2021. Around 200 people were involved in the study and there was an emphasis on those who, 'if it was down to them, they would rather forego the BBC so they do not have to pay the licence fee and those who say the licence fee is too high'. Before the research began, 30 households said they wanted to pay nothing and not receive the BBC's services; another 30 said they would pay less than the current licence fee and the remaining 20 said they would pay the current fee or more. Out of the 60 who were not keen on the current price, 42 said they would now pay the full licence fee or more after the experiment - that means 70% changed their minds. Only one household out of the 20 who initially supported it said they would pay less. These results echoed the findings from the first time MTM conducted such a study into the public's perception of the BBC, back in 2014 and 2015. MTM concluded: 'Both times - with a sample of 150 households across the two waves - would indicate that people's initial view of the value of the licence fee and the BBC is most often likely to be an underestimation.' Afterwards, people were apparently more appreciative that the BBC is ad-free and high quality when compared to its competitors, and they found it was the BBC they wanted to turn to for most trustworthy news. One person told MTM: 'When you look at it, it offers more than what you think. You tend to just think the BBC channels and a bit of radio but like ... there's a lot more to it. There's all your websites, and obviously all the learning stuff for the kids. 'And I didn't realise how much I check on the weather and the news, and when you break it down to PS3 it's not that much really.' The content available on BBC Food and CBeebies were particularly praised, especially when compared to its competitors and the upcoming streaming platforms like Netflix. Yet, 19 of the 80 participants left the study and still wanted to pay less or nothing. One person allegedly pointed out that they don't like how 'everyone has to pay the same set amount regardless' of how much they use BBC content. Despite this encouraging research, more cuts to the BBC are expected to come soon as it looks to make up the losses from Dorries' tightening its budget. At the moment, the BBC is used by 90% of UK adults each week for around 18 hours on average.", "bc0d15241c96403f3c5e7649e5ff369a69127ce96c4cb46e9abe7c2d": "Boris Johnson has insisted the government will not impose a windfall tax on energy firms - because the companies themselves 'don't want' one. The prime minister insisted a one-off levy on their bumper profits would stop them being able to invest in jobs and renewable energy. But he was undermined by Bernard Looney, the chief executive of BP, who told The Times that a windfall tax would not stop any projects they currently have planned. Labour and the Lib Dems have both called for a levy on the huge profits currently being enjoyed by energy companies as a result of the global spike in oil and gas prices. Asked if Looney's comments had changed his views on the merits of a windfall tax, the prime minister said: '[Energy firms] don't want a windfall tax and there's a good reason for that, and that is because it would stop investment in new technology and in new green power that we need. 'The problem we have got is that ... this is an incredible country, incredible economy, fifth biggest in the world, but we're mainlining energy from France. It's insane. 'We haven't invested enough in our own domestic energy and we need these big energy companies to step up to the plate and put their money into sustainable solutions, more green energy and to help keep costs down. 'That is a much, much better solution than clobbering them and dissuading them, stopping them from making that investment. We need those companies to be investing now in the power supply that is going to keep costs down.' Pat McFadden, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: 'The prime minister's comments make it clear, the Conservatives are only interested in protecting oil and gas profits while Labour is on the side of working families. 'BP's chief executive has said that a windfall tax would not affect investment plans and profits are so high that the company is planning to buy back shares.

'It's amazing to have but it's not just for me - it's for all those other women.

Jonathan, who is originally from Wales, reached the semi-final of Simon Cowell's US talent show in 2020 after reaching the final of Britain's Got Talent the previous year. In October last year, he was rehearsing at the Atlanta Motor Speedway in Hampton, Georgia for America's Got Talent: Extreme when he fell 30 feet to the ground after being crushed between two cars in midair. The stunt was supposed to see the escapologist free himself and fall underneath the vehicles before they collided but the cars were released too early. His fiancee, the Sherlock actor Amanda Abbington has now revealed the horrifying extent of his injuries, which have left him paralysed. 'He fell 30 feet and lost a kidney, broke both shoulder blades, shattered both legs,' she told Jay Rayner on the Out To Lunch podcast. 'Third degree burns, broke his spine, severed his spinal cord and nearly died. And then on the operating table, he nearly died again. 'He's just been in rehab since October...

Although the UK is now months into the government's 'Living With Covid' strategy, that doesn't mean the disease has disappeared - more than 100,000 people have tested positive for the last week. Statista.com estimates 1.3 million people are suffering from long Covid symptoms as of January 2022. And scientists have now found that for those who had a severe infection, there is a chance that your cognitive recovery will be gradual. It's also possible that people with milder infections have been impacted.  How could your IQ be affected? Scientists from the University of Cambridge and Imperial College London have found severe infections could impair your cognitive function in the same way your brain naturally ages between 50 to 70 years old. This means people could lose around 10 IQ points from catching the deadly disease if Covid remains detectable in your system more than six months after the initial illness. The scientists' research suggested these long-term effects may even impact people who only had mild cases of Covid. The study looked at data from 46 individuals who received in-hospital care for Covid in Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge. Their results from various cognitive tests from around six months after they suffered from the acute illness were then compared to a control group. Those who had experienced more severe infections were found to be less accurate and slower to respond to the tests, particularly if they had to use mechanical ventilation through their illnesses. Yet, the impact on cognitive function may be felt by those who had more mild infections too. The scientists explained: 'By comparing the patients to 66,008 members of the general public, the researchers estimate that the magnitude of cognitive loss is similar on average to that sustained with 20 years ageing, between 50 and 70 years of age, and that this is equivalent to losing 10 IQ points.' What signs did scientists link to impairment?   Fatigue   Brain fog   Problems recalling words   Sleep disturbances   Anxiety   PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder)   Their memories, attention skills and reasoning abilities were all hit, as well as their problem-solving skills. According to the study, the slower processing abilities can be linked to the decreased brain glucose consumption in the part of the mind which is responsible for problem-solving and working memory. What does this mean for the future? Professor David Menon, the study's senior author from the University of Cambridge, said: 'Cognitive impairment is common to a wide range of neurological disorders, including dementia, and even routine ageing, but the patterns we saw - the cognitive 'fingerprint' of Covid - was distinct from all of these.' There were some early signs that this might be a temporary change, though. Prof Menon added: 'We followed some patients up as late as 10 months after their acute infection, so we were able to see a very slow improvement. 'While this was not statistically significant, it is at least heading in the right direction, but it is very possible that some of these individuals will never fully recover.' Still, he warned that around 400,000 people in the UK may be affected right now. And it's not the only study of its kind This particular set of data uses a relatively small sample size of just 46 individuals. However, another 2021 study from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City also found patients still suffered from cognitive impairment more than seven months after diagnosis. This date set studied 740 people with no prior history of memory problems. Individuals have been reporting long-lasting symptoms, including cognitive problems (often dubbed brain fog) for more than three months after the positive test since the pandemic really took hold of the UK back in 2020. Research from March - published in the scientific journal Nature - also found that Covid shrinks the human brain slightly even after a mild infection. It found that the overall brain size in 401 participants who had Covid experienced between 0.2 and 2% brain shrinkage months after their infection. However, the researchers were not able to discern if the changes were reversible, or what impact this had on the patients.", "c1904e40bfede21f1884b6613be3200c384549fa469397bbf588218e": "A Conservative MP who was found guilty of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy has resigned from parliament. Imran Ahmad Khan, who was elected MP for Wakefield, west Yorkshire, in 2019, was convicted at Southwark Crown Court three weeks ago. Jurors heard how he forced the teenager to drink gin and tonic, dragged him upstairs, pushed him on to a bed and asked him to watch pornography before the attack at a house in Staffordshire in January 2008. His resignation means there will be a by-election in his seat, which he won from Labour's Mary Creagh with a majority of 3,358. Under arcane parliamentary rules, MPs cannot directly resign their seat during a parliament and so have to apply for a paid office of the Crown. As a result, the Treasury today announced that Khan has been appointed Steward and Bailiff of the Three Hundreds of Chiltern. Khan's victim said he wasn't 'taken very seriously' when he first made his allegations to the Conservative Party press office days before the 2019 general election.  He made a complaint to police days after Khan helped prime minister Boris Johnson win a large Commons majority by taking Wakefield in the so-called 'red wall' that had formed Labour's heartlands in the Midlands and northern England.   The victim, now 29, told a jury he was left feeling 'scared, vulnerable, numb, shocked and surprised' after Khan touched his feet and legs, coming within 'a hair's breadth' of his privates, as he went to sleep in a top bunkbed.   He ran to his parents and a police report was made at the time, but no further action was taken because the youngster did not want to make a formal complaint.   But he told jurors 'it all came flooding back' when he learned Khan was standing for parliament. The Tory hopeful was literally parachuted into the constituency in a skydiving stunt after he was selected to replace Antony Calvert weeks before the election.  Khan claimed he only touched the teenager's elbow when he 'became extremely upset' after a conversation about his confused sexuality.   Khan, then 34, said he was trying to be 'kind' and 'helpful', but the teenager became upset and 'bolted' when the topic of pornography was raised. But he was found guilty by a jury after around five hours of deliberations. The date of the by-election will not be announced until next week at the earliest, but Labour will have high hopes of regaining a seat they had previously held since 1931. A separate by-election is also set to be held in Tiverton and Honiton after the sitting Tory MP, Neil Parish, announced he was also resigning after admitting he had twice watched porn in the House of Commons chamber.

Host Susanna Reid didn't waste anytime in grilling the squirming PM, kicking off proceedings at No.10 by asking him if he was a liar. Elsewhere, Susanna also asked the PM about the lockdown parties he was fined for, the war in Ukraine, and the cost of living crisis.  But it was the very end of the interview that provided an absolute zinger. As the PM attempted to get his final few words in, Susanna interrupted him to introduce Lorraine Kelly, whose daily morning programme airs right after GMB. 'Lorraine Kelly is waiting to take up all these issues that you have brought up in this interview,' Susanna told him. 'Who's Lorraine?' Johnson asked. Susanna replied: 'Who's Lorraine? Lorraine is a legend.' But it was Lorraine's reaction that made everyone's morning... 'Wow,' Lorraine said following the interview as the show linked back to the presenter in the ITV studio.  'A masterclass in a political interview, excellent stuff,' she added. Twitter had a lot of thoughts about the 'unforgivable' comment.... Lorraine saw the funny side when she referenced the comment in her mid-morning show , asking 'why should he know who I am?'. Asked if Boris Johnson knows who Lorraine is, the PM's spokesperson told HuffPost UK: 'I think as was clear the prime minister was not fully across the ITV daytime lineup this morning. He has a number of issues to deal with.' Good Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV.

In a major blow for the controversial policy, the prime minister's official spokesman said legal challenges were one of the reasons behind the delay. Johnson announced last month that anyone arriving in the UK via supposedly 'illegal' means would be handed a one-way ticket to Rwanda. Downing Street sources made clear that they expected the first flights to take off by the end of May. Since the policy was announced, hundreds more migrants have continued to make the dangerous journey across the English Channel in search of a new life. The PM's spokesman this morning conceded that the government would miss its initial deportations target. He said: 'It's too early to judge what the situation will be long-term on this policy. You will know - as we've seen - migrant crossings continue, criminal gangs continue to profit. This is unsustainable.' Asked when the success or otherwise of the plan could be judged, the spokesman said: 'I don't think there's a fixed date ... obviously, there are a number of variables we need to deal with, not least some of the legal challenges which have been talked about.' The spokesman was unable to say when the first flight would be: 'We have received pre-action correspondence from a number of legal firms, I can't get into that more ... but we still maintain our hope to have the first flights take place in a matter of months.'

In the US, a leaked draft document appears to suggest the majority of US Supreme Court justices support overturning Roe v Wade - the historic case law that legalised abortion.  According to the news organisation Politico, which published the leaked document, the draft opinion shows the court voted to strike down the landmark case. However, it is unclear if the draft represents the court's final decision.  If the law is overturned, 26 out of 50 US states are 'certain or likely' to ban abortion, according to research from the think tank the Guttmacher Institute. Speaking to HuffPost UK, Mandu Reid, leader of the Women's Equality Party, described the news coming from the US as 'chilling'.  'It is an outright assault on the rights of American women, threatening to deny fifty percent of the population their bodily autonomy. It has ominous consequences for women everywhere and is a reflection of the global backlash against reproductive rights,' she says.  'It brings into sharp focus just how fragile the right to free, safe, and legal abortions is - and that applies to the UK too. Make no mistake, abortion access is not watertight in the UK, and has been under threat for years, as we've seen with recent threats to at-home abortions, the requirement for two doctors to sign off on an abortion, and the fact that it is still not a legal right.  'What is happening in America is a warning to all of us, and must be a catalyst for abortion to be codified in law and health policies here in the UK, as a matter of utmost urgency.' Although abortion is legal across the UK, under a law passed in 1861, any woman who ends a pregnancy without legal authorisation from two doctors can face up to life imprisonment, which is why campaigners continue to call for abortion to be decriminalised.  And although abortion was legalised in Northern Ireland in October 2019, access to appointments remains limited.  Parts of the UK have already experienced a rise in anti-abortion activists outside clinics in recent years, with some claiming to have been directly 'recruited' by American religious groups.  Elsewhere in the world, women's reproductive rights have already been rescinded. In 2021, Poland enforced a near-total ban on abortion, having previously allowed terminations.  On social media, many people have expressed concern that the latest US developments will only embolden those who hold anti-women views.  Moves to eradicate women's reproductive rights are particularly disturbing for women like Kyanne Smith, who had an abortion in April 2020 via the telemedicine home-abortion system. The 23-year-old from London says our rights must be proactively protected.  'We know that a ban on abortion doesn't stop them from happening; it just stops safe ones,' she says. 'If I hadn't been able to legally access a pregnancy termination, I would have found a way to get one. 'Where does this leave pregnant people in the US? It leaves them with forced births, unsafe terminations or spending an insane amount of money travelling to access basic healthcare, which isn't an option for many. If we stand by and let this happen across America, a dangerous precedent is set for the UK. Keep your awful laws off our bodies.'  Clare Murphy, chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) - one of the largest abortion providers in the UK - echoes these concerns.  'It sends a dangerous message internationally,' she says of the leaked document. 'In many other countries, women are still fighting for safe, legal abortion care. If the US were to revoke the constitutional right to abortion, this will ultimately hamper progress in other nations.'  BPAS has launched a petition addressed to Liz Truss in her role as foreign secretary, calling on the government to 'clearly condemn' the Roe vs Wade draft opinion as a breach of human rights. Boris Johnson's spokesperson said on Tuesday that the decision was 'a matter for the US courts', but added: 'The UK fully supports women's reproductive rights globally and including the right to access safe and legal abortion.' Conservative Caroline Nokes, the chair of the Commons women and equalities committee, told HuffPost: 'It is a deeply worrying attack on long established women's rights which I certainly hope we see no replication of here.' MSI Reproductive Choices (formerly named Marie Stopes), which works across 37 countries, is also concerned the draft report could have global consequences.  'If it stands it would be the biggest setback to women's rights in the US in a generation and deeply concerning for global reproductive rights,' the charity's head of advocacy, Sarah Shaw, says.  'Each year, 25 million women around the world resort to dangerous and unsafe methods. At MSI, our teams worldwide witness and deal with the terrible consequences of this every day. No one should be seeking to replicate this situation in the US. The right to choose must be protected.'", "3c5fabf2c6e644fd27ed18bd2dbd15e3d81be78808e8223d8a5dd051": "Are you still working from home? Whether it's still WFH all week or a hybrid-situation, many of us enjoy the opportunity to work from our home offices without worrying about transport costs, time, and other logistics such as lunch and outfits. But one company is offering all those things at a price. A law firm has said it is offering staff the chance to completely WFH...if they agree to take a 20% pay cut. Stephenson Harwood said it would allow remote working but pay employees 20% less off their salary.  The firm told the BBC that it has started recruiting remote workers on a lower salary as they're hiring people from around the country who no longer need to commute into the capital, saving them money. Those who do decide to come in on some days could then claim travel expenses. The firm is also offering the remote working option to existing staff, bar partners, and applying the salary difference between the two packages.  But, it said, they don't expect many people to take up the offer and go fully remote as the role requires some experience of the office environment. Since it revealed its pay-cutting plan, many have pointed out the problems with such a model. Harriet Minter, a hybrid-work consultant and author of WFH, How to Build a Career You Love when You're Not in the Office, said it would encourage the gender pay gap, as those who are likely to take up the offer of full remote working are to be women, who often have more care responsibility. She tells HuffPost that there are other implications for a move like this. 'The short term implication is that it's damaging for an employer's brand. All employers want to look progressive and like a good place to work, but threatening to cut the pay of staff that work remotely suggests that your business just wants to go back to the old ways of working - regardless of what your staff want. It's hardly progressive thinking.' HuffPost has contacted Stephenson Harwood about these concerns and will update this article if we receive a response.  There are other potential consequences too, including people resigning. 'It will impact staff retention and recruitment,' says Minter.  'We know there is a battle for talent at the moment, businesses which offer more flexible working practices, without any penalty for them, are going to have their pick of the best talent out there. And your employees who are already feeling devalued and under-motivated as a result of this policy, are going to leave to go somewhere they are appreciated and paid properly.' Others said that working from home doesn't mean working less. In fact, research shows that half of employees are working longer hours at home. And by taking away large office spaces, companies could also save on renting spaces.  So those putting in extra hours at home would be getting paid less for it.  Other firms such as Apple who are also considering more time in the office have faced similar pushback. Hundreds of people signed an open letter to CEO Tim Cook saying plans to return to the office for the majority of the time would make the brand 'younger, whiter and more male-dominated'.  They wrote that this 'will change the makeup of our workforce and lead to privileges deciding who can work for Apple, not who'd be the best fit.' Those that it would benefit include young people, those without family commitments, or with a stay-at-home partner (most likely to be men).   What are your thoughts. Would you take a pay cut to stay home?

Explaining his absence, Mo said: 'I love being a part of the Masked team so I'm gutted to be missing most of the series this year as I'll be working in the US.

After this morning's roasting at the hands of Susanna Reid, it's likely to be even longer before he agrees to do so again. The PM's infamous run-in with a fridge before the 2019 election was the last time GMB came close to interrogating him live on air. There's a fair chance he was left looking for somewhere equally dark and cold in which to recover from this 25-minute grilling. Reid wasted no time in putting Johnson on the back foot by asking him: 'Are you honest, prime minister?' After eventually insisting that he was, the prime minister attempted to turn the discussion to the government's record. But Reid was having none of it, pointing out Johnson's reputation for having a loose relationship with the truth. It was already clear that if Number 10 thought this would be a soft soap interview giving the PM some free air time in the run-up to Thursday's local elections, they were sadly mistaken. The worst moment for Johnson - and there were a few to choose from - came when Reid told him about 77-year-old GMB viewer Elsie, who rides the bus all day because she can't afford to heat her home. Inexplicably, the prime minister attempted to make a virtue of her predicament by insisting - wrongly, as it turns out - that she could only do this because he had introduced the freedom pass for pensioners when he was mayor of London. 'Marvellous, so Elsie should be grateful to you for her bus pass,' Reid asked. A more empathetic politician would not have immediately sought to take credit for the fact that a pensioner is resorting to aimlessly travelling round London all day because it's preferable to being in her unheated home. As he attempted to bluster his way through the rest of his answer, Reid said: 'Prime minister, you can't say anything to help Elsie, can you?' The worry for the Conservative Party is that, with voters set to go to the polls in two days' time, the rest of the country has reached the same conclusion.", "e74d7ccc6b6fb2b3a8b518bb34623c7e4a71a8c1b0725ab63ff33a2e": "Katy Perry fully committed to the Disney theme on this weekend's American Idol when she dressed up as The Little Mermaid. However, after being carried to her chair behind the judging panel's desk - because, well, mermaids can't walk - the singer quickly found out the hard way that swivel chairs and finned tails really do not mix. Shortly after taking her seat, host Ryan Seacrest's face said it all before the cameras quickly panned round to show Katy flat on her back with her mermaid's tail flapping about in the air. Katy's Little Mermaid costume is the latest outfit she's worn for the annual Disney-themed night. Since signing on to be a judge on the US show in 2018, the Firework singer has come dressed as Cinderella, Snow White, Ursula, Mrs Dumbo and Tinker Bell. Maybe pick one with legs next time, Katy? The singer swapped her mermaid costume for a stunning black Oscar de la Renta gown for Monday night's Met Gala. It was a decidedly more understated look than usual for the star, who is well-known for rocking up to the annual fashion bash in some over-the-top outfits. In 2019, she dressed up as both a chandelier and a cheeseburger for the Camp-themed red carpet event. Ahead of this year's event, Katy told Page Six that she intended to switch it up 'You know, it would be pretty obvious for me to go play the kooky, crazy, wild, big, fun, colourful card,' she said last month.

Boris Johnson's spokesperson said on Tuesday the decision was 'a matter for the US courts'. But added: 'The UK fully supports women's reproductive rights globally and including the right to access safe and legal abortion.' The report came amid a legislative push to restrict abortion in several Republican-led states -- Oklahoma being the most recent -- even before the court issues its decision.

The leak jumpstarted the intense political reverberations that the court's ultimate decision was expected to have in the midterm election year.

The reality TV personality, known for starring in Keeping Up With The Kardashians, has become a style icon and beauty mogul in her own right over the years. So it's hardly surprising that Kardashian made headlines by wearing the exact dress Monroe wore in 1962, when she seductively sang Happy Birthday Mr President to JF Kennedy. However, people have pointed out several significant problems with Kardashian's look - especially when it came to her preparation for the event. The star revealed she had to lose 16 pounds in three weeks just to fit into the dress when speaking to Vogue magazine on the red carpet. She said: 'It was such a challenge. It was like a role. I was determined to fit.' 'I always thought she [Monroe] was extremely curvy,' Kardashian continued. 'I imagined I might be smaller in some places where she was bigger and bigger in places where she was smaller. 'So when it didn't fit me I wanted to cry because it can't be altered at all.' Kardashian even detailed how she lost more than a stone in such a short time. 'I would wear a sauna suit twice a day, run on the treadmill, completely cut out all sugar and all carbs, and just eat the cleanest veggies and protein. I didn't starve myself but I was so strict.' Losing so much weight in less than a month is rarely - if ever - recommended by health experts, especially as sweating out your water weight through a sauna suit is likely to just leave you severely dehydrated. The TV personality also said she wanted to 'cry tears of joy' when she finally fit into the gown, a direct contradiction of the positive messages coming from health and fashion campaigners that clothes are meant to fit our bodies, not the other way around. Kardashian skipped the afterparty for the event, too, and revealed she was going to gorge on 'pizza and doughnuts' instead. Again, binging is rarely a practice promoted by health professionals as it can have a huge impact on your body, especially after following such a strict diet. The star's weight loss is the latest talking point in the ongoing conversation about how we talk about our diets. It comes just after the UK decided to introduce calorie counts on restaurant menus, which already prompted fears that we are going backwards in our approach to body image. This isn't the first time Kardashian has faced significant backlash for promoting an unhealthy approach to her appearance either. In 2018, her sisters could be heard telling the star she 'looks anorexic' and 'really skinny' on her Instagram stories, to which Kardashian replied: 'Oh my god, the compliments!' The star has been criticised for her heavy use of Photoshop and accused of setting unrealistic beauty standards for her 307 million Instagram followers through her altered posts. Kardashian has promoted questionable weight loss products in the past too, including an appetite suppressant lollipop and so-called diet teas.

In a combative interview with ITV's Good Morning Britain on Tuesday morning, the prime minister was challenged over the cost of living crisis hitting many people across the country. Presenter Susanna Reid told Johnson about Elsie, a 77-year-old widow, who has seen her energy bills rise from PS17 a month to PS85 a month. 'To cut down on spending, Elsie has now resorted to eating one meal a day. She's 77-years-old. She's losing weight,' Reid said. 'She gets up early in the morning to use her freedom bus pass to stay on buses all day to avoid using energy at home. What else should Elsie cut back on?' Johnson said he did not want Elsie to cut back on 'anything', before adding: 'Just to remind you, the 24-hour freedom bus pass was something I actually introduced.' Reid replied: 'So Elsie should be grateful?' As London mayor in 2012, Johnson moved to ensure people aged 60 and over were entitled to free travel around the city, after the age at which people were eligible began to creep upwards.  Jon Ashworth, Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, said: 'It is utterly shameful that pensioners have no choice but to sit on the bus all day to avoid racking up heating bills at home, or are left shivering in blankets and only eating one meal a day.  'For Boris Johnson to respond by boasting about the London bus pass reveals just how out of touch this narcissistic Prime Minister is.' The government has set out a PS9 billion package of loans to cut energy bills and council tax rebates, but the PM faces calls to go further. Johnson insisted his government was doing 'everything we can' to help with the cost-of-living crisis. He warned that increasing state support beyond its current levels could drive inflation even higher. And Johnson said there was 'global context' caused by a surge in energy prices which is hitting all aspects of the economy including food, adding: 'The cost of chickens is crazy.' Labour has called for a windfall tax on on oil and gas firms to provide more direct help for cash-strapped households and businesses. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that price rises were the 'single most pressing issue keeping people up at night'.", "16018b72f238d697e4463153fd0bb26b32aabeeaa8bf6a72865e187a": "Boris Johnson has insisted he is 'honest' -- despite admitting he 'inadvertently' gave false statements in parliament over the partygate row. The prime minister was taken to task over his record of honesty by Good Morning Britain host Susanna Reid. She last interviewed Johnson since on the show five years ago when he was foreign secretary. Johnson has boycotted the programme since he famously hid in a fridge during the 2019 general election campaign to avoid a grilling from former host Piers Morgan in the studio. Reid kicked off the testy interview by asking Johnson: 'People want to know, are you honest, prime minister? He replied: 'Yes. I think the best way to judge that is to look at what this government says it's going to do and what it does.' Reid then asked: 'You're an honest speaker?' 'Yes,' Johnson replied.  'I do my best to represent faithfully and accurately what I believe, and sometimes it's controversial and sometimes it offends people, but that's what I do.' Last month Johnson was subject to a successful vote in parliament calling for an urgent investigation into claims he misled MPs about parties hosted in Downing Street during the pandemic. The prime minister repeatedly told the Commons that no rules were broken and that guidance was followed at all times as the partygate scandal began to break at the end of last year. Johnson was then slapped with a fine from the Metropolitan Police last month for attending a birthday party hosted for him in the Cabinet room in No.10 on June 19, 2020, when gathering indoors between more than two people was banned. The fine led to more calls for the PM to resign and raised questions over the credibility of his answers to MPs. Later in the interview Reid asked Johnson about the reputation he had garnered for lying. 'Sometimes people say you lie, prime minister,' she asked. Johnson hit back: 'If you're talking about the statements I made in the House of Commons, I was inadvertently, I was wrong, and I've apologised for that.' While the Met has said it will not issue any further fines during the local elections, Tory MPs remain nervous that the scandal will cast a shadow on Thursday 5 May, when voters elect or re-elect their councillors. Some estimates suggest the party could lose between 500 and 800 seats. A particularly bad result could prompt Tory MPs disaffected with Johnson to submit a letter of no confidence in Johnson, with 54 needed to trigger a vote on his leadership.", "6700c251e556eae538533e31839030896864cca389a04918f86894b0": "Boris Johnson has ruled out imposing a windfall tax on oil and gas companies - despite BP posting bumper profits this morning. The oil giant announced an underlying profit of PS5bn, more than double last year's figure and their biggest surplus in over a decade, thanks to soaring oil prices. But the prime minister rejected calls from opposition parties to impose a one-off levy on the companies, and to use the cash to help families cope with the cost of living crisis. The Prime Minister told ITV's Good Morning Britain that would 'discourage them from making the investments that we want to see that will, in the end, keep energy price prices lower for everybody'. He added: 'We have a short-term hit caused by the spike in energy prices across the world. 'If we respond by driving up prices and costs across the board in this country, responding by the government stepping in and driving up inflation, that will hit everybody. 'And that will mean that people's interest rates on their mortgages go up, the cost of borrowing goes up, and we face an even worse problem.' His comments appeared to put him at odds with chancellor Rishi Sunak, who last week told Mumsnet that he had not ruled out a windfall tax. He said: 'What I would say is that if we don't see that type of investment coming forward and companies are not going to make those investments in our country and energy security, then of course that's something I would look at and nothing is ever off the table in these things.' The cabinet split on the issue was highlighted on Sunday when business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said he was also opposed to a windfall tax. He told Sky News: ''I've never been a supporter of windfall taxes, I've been very clear about that publicly. I think they discourage investment.' Labour leader Keir Starmer said BP's profits demonstrated that a windfall tax is the 'right approach'. He told BBC Breakfast: 'I think those figures reinforce the case that we've been making, which is that, with so many people struggling to pay their energy bills, we should have a windfall tax on oil and gas companies in the North Sea who have made more profit than they were expecting. 'Have a windfall tax on that and use that to help people with their energy bills, up to PS600 for those who need it most.' Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said: 'The Conservative government's refusal to introduce a windfall tax on the super profits of oil companies is becoming impossible to justify.  'BP is raking in eye-watering profits while millions of people struggle to pay the bills.

'You've got some women there and they want to make something up. I've seen the headlines of feuds escalating,' Rachel said last year. The new mum then added: 'I've been on maternity leave for about six to eight weeks.' However, Rachel did go on to admit that her and Anne weren't exactly best mates. '[Anne's] not the cuddliest person in the world,' she said. 'But it's just a different show now, she's making it her own. She's getting some stuff out of the contestants - sometimes it's barbed, sometimes it's funny, it's just got a different flavour.'", "9bfdf8d5a5bb482801c01277b24429ae74d98511bb7790b41e6d4276": "The 2022 Met Gala's 'gilded glamour' theme is one that should be all too familiar to Bridgerton stars. Nicola Coughlan, best known for playing Penelope Featherington on the hit Netflix series, channeled her character with a regal pink-and-black dress with puff sleeves and, most appropriately, *feathers.* Meanwhile, Simone Ashley, who starred as Kate Sharma in Season 2 of the period series, wowed in a corset and skirt with statement sleeves. Fans were disappointed, however, when the diamond of Season 1 failed to produce the splendor they're used to seeing on her in the Regency-era drama. Phoebe Dynevor, aka Daphne Bridgerton, left some onlookers underwhelmed in a relatively muted black dress. From dramatic puff sleeves to corsets, ruffles, lace floral prints and opulent jewelry, Shonda Rhimes' adaptation of Julia Quinn's novels has been filled with fashion statements. Fans expected that to align with the theme of 2022's Met Gala, which asked attendees to 'embody the grandeur -- and perhaps the dichotomy -- of Gilded Age New York.' The one Bridgerton character who really would have met the brief, sadly, did not make an appearance.", "741f701d409d669a79d546b5faaea7b74ecb1d6b6cfe24acfbfb3ed8": "If anyone knows how to steal the show, it's Blake Lively.  Lively, who's co-chair of this year's Met Gala alongside her husband Ryan Reynolds, ignited the red carpet with her arrival on Monday evening.  Donning a copper Atelier Versace gown, Blake and her assistants performed an unexpected switch-a-roo right in the middle of the carpet.  Her bow-embellished dress metamorphosed into an aqua blue showstopper as her assistants helped 'unwrap' it on the red carpet.  'I arrived copper and then, like New York City classic architecture, I patinaed,' the actor said of her unveiling.  Resembling iconic New York City landmarks like the Empire State Building, the dress was accessorised with a crown featuring seven spikes in a nod to the Statue of Liberty. The Gossip Girl star said this year's event was 'especially nerve-wracking.' 'Being one of the hosts, you really feel like you need to bring your A-game,' she said.  This year's Met Gala theme was In America: An Anthology of Fashion, but Blake put her own twist on it by representing New York and focusing on the 'architecture rather than just the fashion.'  The actor has dominated the Met Gala red carpet over the years, and she has yet to disappoint.  At the 2018 Gala, themed Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination, she sported a crimson Versace gown with an embroidered bodice, an extra-long train and lots of bejeweled action. The entire ensemble took 600 hours to make by hand.

Just eight short months after we kinda sorta saw Kim Kardashian in her infamous all-black look at the Met Gala in 2021.  Vogue's annual fashion extravaganza at the Metropolitan Museum of Art has traditionally taken place during the first Monday in May. But thanks to Covid, last year's fashion fete got bumped from spring to September. So if you thought you were partaking in the great pandemic tradition of questioning your sense of time, don't worry. You're fine. But if you're wondering about the theme of Monday night's event, be prepared to be perplexed once more. The theme this year was In America: An Anthology of Fashion, which is a sequel to last year's theme, In America: A Lexicon of Fashion. People described the dress code as white-tie with an emphasis on 'Gilded Glamour.'  The Gilded Age was a tumultuous period between the Civil War and the turn of the 20th century that was known for robber barons, drama and grandeur. It was also a time of social inequality, in which a small population of elite folks enjoyed oodles of wealth. Think: John D. Rockefeller, Cornelius Vanderbilt and J.P. Morgan -- and Bertha Russell (Carrie Coon) and her fabulous, over-the-top hats in HBO's The Gilded Age. There weren't a ton of hats at the 2022 Met Gala, but there were plenty of capes, bodices and dramatic colours, plus a pirate of two (we're looking at you, Shawn Mendes and Lenny Kravitz) and what appeared to be, uh, gilded pasties (see: Cara Delevingne). Kim Kardashian's nod to America of yore was sporting the iconic dress Marilyn Monroe wore to sing Happy Birthday to President John F. Kennedy. The reality star didn't quite nail Monroe's signature hairdo, opting instead for a slicked-back look.  Sadly, both Zendaya and Rhianna kept true to their words and didn't show up. But, hey, plenty of other celebrities made an appearance in great, not-so-great and completely whacky outfits, so scroll on down and enjoy!

Before the reality star hit the carpet, sleuths across social media were debating the chance of catching Kim in the gown due to some not-so-subtle hints she dropped about this year's event.  Last month during an interview with Access Hollywood, she shared that her attire was still in the works for fashion's biggest night because the fit had to be exact. 'It really depends if I fit into my dress, so I hope I'm going,' she said. 'I think it will be up to the last minute because it can't be tailored, so I have to fit into it like exactly.' Only two weeks later, Kardashian and boyfriend Pete Davidson were spotted in Orlando, Florida, visiting the Ripley's Believe It or Not! museum, where the iconic dress Marilyn wore while singing 'Happy Birthday' to President John F. Kennedy is stored, according to The Sun. There was even a Reddit thread dedicated to speculating about what Kim would wear, with some suggesting that Marilyn's high-profile dress aligns with this year's white-tie 'Glided Glamour' dress code. The iconic dress became famous after her breathy, seductive take on 'Happy Birthday' at a fundraiser for Kennedy and the Democratic National Committee in 1962. Kim knows how to create some serious buzz with her previous Met Gala looks, including last year's widely memed Balenciaga 'shadow' ensemble and her jaw-dropping, barely-there corseted latex dress worn in 2019.", "0e5b5b968d37f6dc8c425fec0a598f7a03cb489014cd44eaa82a6b29": " Kids may say the darndest things, but parents tweet about them in the funniest ways.

He'll be the first to admit that he wasn't the best leader back in those days. In fact, by his own account, he was 'a terrible manager' back then. These days, Rechs says he's considerably better at leading - and a tweet thread he posted earlier this month that went viral seems to vouch for that. In the thread, titled 11 Promises From a Manager, Rechs, who's also a career and business coach, outlined the kind of relationship he tries to forge with employees who report to him directly. As he sees it, the manager-employee relationship should emphasize clarity and trust while also prioritising the individual worker's needs. 'I've managed about 100 people since I first started,' Rechs told HuffPost in an email. 'At some point I discovered the idea of servant leadership, which for me means that leaders should center the needs of their people rather than themselves.'  Rechs' promises as he wrote them are as follows:     We'll have a weekly 1:1. I'll never cancel this meeting, but you can cancel it whenever you like. It's your time.   Our 1:1 agenda will be in the meeting invite so we remember important topics. But you're always free to use the time for whatever's on your mind.   When I schedule a meeting with you, I'll always say *when I schedule it* what it's meant to be about. I will not schedule meetings without an agenda.   When I drop into your DM's, I'll always say 'hi and why.' No suspense, no small talk while you are wondering what I want.   News or announcements that significantly impact you, your work, or your team will come from me directly in a 1:1, not revealed in a big meeting.   You'll get feedback from me when it's fresh. There will be no feedback in your performance review that you're hearing for the first time.   I trust you to manage your own time. You don't need to clear with me in advance your time AFK or OOO.   Your work gets done your way. My focus is on outcomes, not output. Once we're clear on where we need to go, how to get there is up to you. If I ever find it necessary to suggest a specific approach, I will supply an example.   A team is strongest when it's working together, looking after one another, and taking care of each other. Please look to your left and to your right for opportunities to help your colleagues. Please ask for help when you need it. Nobody works alone.   I trust you to skip level and talk to my manager or other senior management about anything you feel is relevant. You don't need to clear it with me, and I'm not going to get weird about it when you do.   I will attribute credit appropriately to you and your team. I will never exaggerate my own role or minimize your contribution. I'll be especially certain to nail down attribution when senior management are hearing of our accomplishments.   At the end of the Twitter thread, Rechs shared the one thing he asks in return from his direct reports.  'If this sounds good to you, please reciprocate by giving me in return what I need most: The truth. Give me your feedback, say when I'm wrong, and tell me your ideas for how we can do better,' he wrote. 'If we trust each other, we can learn and grow together. That's how I want to work with you.' The initial tweet in the thread has racked up 7,124 retweets and 57,300 'likes' since Rechs posted it on April 18. 'This is what good leadership looks like,' one man said in a quote-retweet. Another joked, 'This is one of the most valuable threads I've run across and I'm bookmarking it as Best Practices For Not Freaking Out People With Anxiety. (hi. it's me.).' Melody Wilding, an executive coach and author of Trust Yourself: Stop Overthinking and Channel Your Emotions for Success at Work, isn't surprised the thread went viral.  With returns to offices happening in a hybrid form for many workers and with so many traditional workplace structures being reexamined, employees want to hold on to the autonomy they gained during the coronavirus pandemic, Wilding said. 'This thread encapsulates what employees want most right now: clarity, empathy, and transparency and trust,' she said.  'Bosses need to show their teams they trust them,' she added. 'It doesn't matter how something gets done as long as the final work product meets expectations. It's far more important that your team feels ownership and autonomy.' Workplace expert Lynn Taylor was a fan of the thread, too, but she had one minor criticism: When it comes to promise number 10 on the list - the one in which Rechs tells his direct reports it's fine to skip levels and talk to his manager and other senior management if they need to - Taylor doesn't think most bosses will be quite as open-minded about that. 'That's a highly motivational approach,' said Taylor, the author of Tame Your Terrible Office Tyrant: How to Manage Childish Boss Behavior and Thrive in Your Job. 'It may be a lofty goal in real life with some managers.' The best approach may be to test the waters first; maybe you even reference the viral tweets. 'Ask your manager how they feel about the idea,' Taylor said.  S. Chris Edmonds, a human resources expert and founder of The Purposeful Culture Group, wishes more managers would adopt the kind of leadership style described in the tweets.  'These 'promises' seem to be founded on service to team members, and far too few leaders see their jobs as serving,' he told HuffPost. 'One-on-one meetings, for instance, are one of the most powerful ways leaders can serve, develop, coach and validate their team members.' Most leaders 'are trained to focus on results, not respect,' Edmonds added. 'They have leadership role models that drive performance above all else.' Ultimately, though, there's room for growth with any manager, even bad ones. Rechs himself is proof of that. 'I don't believe in bad managers anymore,' he told us. 'No manager of mine was as bad, probably, as I have been myself. There really is no growth without failure.'

But now, a campaign has launched to accurately reflect the diversity of women and their bodies, in a bid to help all woman access the healthcare they need. In a new digital gallery, titled The Reframing Revolution, designers have created dozens of new illustrations to be released into the medical field, showing demonstrations of the following on a variety of skin tones:    IVF Bruising   PCOS   Linea nigra   Pregnancy breast changes   Ectopic pregnancy   Vaginal birth   Stillbirth   Postpartum body   C-section   Jaundice in babies   Breastfeeding   Hair loss   Hot flashes   Vulvas   It comes after a picture of a Black foetus, created by illustrator Chidiebere Sunday Ibe, went viral on social media last year.  The latest project was spearheaded by the women's community app Peanut and informed by doctors and medical illustrators.  They worked with Dr Somi Javaid, OB/GYN doctor, surgeon, and founder of HerMD, and the team at Biotic Artlab, a visual communications studio specialising in creative solutions for science and medicine, to ensure accurate depictions of the anatomy and recognition of underrepresented groups of women.  The campaign highlights how women have historically been misrepresented in healthcare, portraying all female anatomy as one-size-fits-all, when the reality is there is no 'normal' when it comes to body types.  One in four women has a degree of asymmetry in their breasts. Meanwhile, 97% of OBGYNs have been asked by women of all ages about genital normality, yet not all could confidently feel they could express what normal is. Using healthcare's current images of the female body is extremely damaging to both women's physical and mental wellbeing. When women don't fit within a biased image - particularly mothers, Black and other minority women and those who have traditionally fallen outside of commonly portrayed bodies - their representation is eliminated, which means they do not receive the healthcare they need.  Currently medical textbooks only show 17% of images as POC and of those images, a majority (75%) are women with light skin tones.  The unconscious bias in education can lead to inequity in medical practice often which has fatal consequences. Black women face greater barriers to accessing proper healthcare. Black women in the UK are still four times more likely to die in childbirth, for example. Omitting diverse bodies in medical literature allows a gateway for bias to enter medical treatment. The new gallery of images is available, royalty-free, for women, media, and the medical community to adapt into practices, journals, and more.  'It's just as important, if not more so, for women to see themselves in healthcare as they do in media and business,' Michelle Kennedy, founder and CEO of Peanut said. 'Women have been misdiagnosed and mistreated because their healthcare provider didn't recognise their physical symptoms on non-white skin. 'Our goal with these new illustrations is to not only educate patients and the medical field, but society at large. Women and mothers in all their forms, sizes and identities need to be represented.' Dr Somi Javaid added: 'As practitioners, it is our job to treat every patient to the best of our ability. When there are clear biases in the tools we use to diagnose, we're not bringing our best to every patient 'These new illustrations will showcase the diverse bodies and skin tones healthcare providers will see in their daily rounds and change the course of how we treat patients who have been underrepresented and under treated for so long.'

The prime minister left his partygate woes in London on May Day bank holiday Monday as he was pictured on his official Twitter feed with an ice-cream and surrounded by young people taking photos. An accompanying tweet read: 'It was a fantastic day to be out campaigning in Teesside, where we're delivering a massive programme of investment as part of our plan to level up the whole of the UK.' The trouble is, as plenty were keen to point out, he wasn't in Teesside. As The Whitley Whaler fish and chip shop in the background suggests, the PM was in Whitley Bay, the seaside town on Tyneside - or on the River Tyne, not the River Tees. 'Erm...how to say this...?,' tweeted Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner. 'That's NOT Teesside.' While both areas would have been part of the sprawling Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria, Whitley Bay today falls within the authority of North Tyneside Council, which goes to the polls on Thursday. Middlesbrough, on the banks of the River Tees, is 40 miles away, and Teesside is split between County Durham and North Yorkshire for the purposes of local governance. While there's every chance Johnson himself did not pen the geographically-confused tweet, someone on Team Johnson appears to have spotted the error and deleted the indiscretion - replacing it with a tweet referencing the safer 'north east'.

Speaking by video link, the prime minister will use a speech on Tuesday to call the fightback Ukraine's 'finest hour' as he set out details of a new PS300 million package of military support. Downing Street said it will include electronic warfare equipment, a counter battery radar system, GPS jamming equipment and thousands of night vision devices, as Russia's offensive in the Donbas region continues. It follows Johnson's unannounced visit to the Ukrainian capital last month, in a show of support and solidarity with president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. In his address, the prime minister will echo the words of Britain's leader during the Second World War, as Zelenskyy did when he spoke to the Westminster parliament in March. 'When my country faced the threat of invasion during the Second World War, our parliament, like yours, continued to meet throughout the conflict, and the British people showed such unity and resolve that we remember our time of greatest peril as our finest hour,' Johnson is expected to say. 'This is Ukraine's finest hour, an epic chapter in your national story that will be remembered and recounted for generations to come. 'Your children and grandchildren will say that Ukrainians taught the world that the brute force of an aggressor counts for nothing against the moral force of a people determined to be free.' The latest military support package comes after ministers updated Parliament last week on plans to send sophisticated long-range Brimstone missiles and Stormer air defence vehicles. In addition, the UK is to supply heavy lift aerial drones to provide logistical support to Ukrainian forces which have become isolated.

The opposition leader said he 'wants the chance to make our case to voters' amid speculation the prime minister could trigger a snap poll in the autumn. Allies of the PM believe the prospect of an election later this year will prevent any attempt by Tory MPs to remove him as leader over partygate or if the Conservatives do badly in Thursday's local elections. But speaking to HuffPost UK while campaigning in Worthing, West Sussex, Starmer said: 'I'm ready any time for an election. 'We've done a huge amount of work in the last two years and brought about an incredible change in the Labour Party and moved from an opposition to an alternative. 'The fact that here in Worthing we're talking about the possibility of a Labour council for the first time ever, I think shows how far we've come. 'We're absolutely focused on the issues that matter most to people at the moment. 'I don't mind when an election comes and I don't mind who the leader is on the other side. We want the chance to make our case because Britain deserves better.' Starmer also defended his decision to put Tony Blair in Labour's latest election video, despite the former leader's deep unpopularity with many activists who flocked to the party under Jeremy Corbyn. He said: 'I'm very clear that I'm happy to talk with Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. They won three elections and the whole purpose of the Labour Party is to be a party of government and to change lives. 'I didn't come into politics to be in opposition. I want us to win an election because I want to bring about the change that a Labour government can bring about. 'I'm very happy to talk to winners and Tony Blair is a winner.' On accusations that he has taken Labour too far to the right, despite pledging to maintain Corbyn's legacy, Starmer said: 'I'm focused on the electorate and the people I need to persuade to vote Labour and the millions of people who will be better off with a Labour government. 'What we've done in the last two years is to change the Labour Party profoundly. What's driven that for me is the strong sense that if we lose as badly as we did in 2019, I don't look at the electorate and say 'what were you doing, why didn't you hear us'. 'I looked at Labour and said we must change as a party, and we have, whether that's with anti-semitism or whether that's being completely clear about our unshakeable support for NATO. But more profoundly, aligning the Labour Party to the priorities of so many millions of people across the country. 'We got far too distant from the issues that most people in the country are talking about in their kitchens, in their cafes and in their workplaces.' Starmer also all-but ruled out any chance of Jeremy Corbyn being re-admitted to the Labour Party. The former leader lost the party whip over his response to the Equalities and Human Rights Commission's report into anti-semitism in Labour when he was leader. Asked if he could have it returned, Starmer said: 'I think that's going to be pretty difficult given the issues that there are between us.'", "f84723ce62dbbbed596da8df4e46bdcd47e4c6c7cba4e8143a830a91": "A Conservative MP says he 'feels sorry' for a colleague who was forced to quit after he admitted watching porn in the House of Commons. Neil Parish's political career came to an abrupt end after it emerged he was the Tory accused by female MPs of viewing inappropriate material in parliament. He admitted to the BBC on Saturday that he had twice watched adult content on his phone, claiming the first time was accidental after looking at tractors online. The select committee chairman had initially vowed to continue as MP for Tiverton and Honiton but said he would quit after recognising the 'furore' and 'damage' he was causing his family and constituency. Tory chief whip Chris Heaton-Harris suspended Parish from the parliamentary Conservative Party on Friday afternoon - three days after female Tory MPs first raised complaints of a male colleague watching porn on his phone in the Commons chamber. Parish's resignation means there will now be a by-election in his Devon seat, which he retained for the Tories at the last election with a majority of 24,239. Despite his dramatic fall from grace, Parish today received the support of Michael Fabricant, the Conservative MP for Lichfeld. He tweeted: 'Actually, I feel sorry for Neil. There. I've said it.' Friends of Parish have reportedly claimed he was searching for a 'Dominator' combine harvester when he first viewed porn in the Commons. Before being identified as the MP at the centre of the storm, Parish was asked about the allegations during an appearance on GB News. He was non-committal on whether the suspect should have the whip removed and denied there was a large cultural problem in Westminster, despite senior Conservative colleagues having decried it as being 'shameful'. 'We've got some 650 members of parliament in what is a very intense area,' Mr Parish said. 'We are going to get people that step over the line. I don't think there's necessarily a huge culture here but I think it does have to be dealt with and dealt with seriously and that's what the whips will do.' Earlier today, a minister poured cold water on suggestions that the Tory candidate to replace Parish should be drawn from an all-women shortlist. Universities minister Michelle Donelan told Sky News: 'I've never been in favour of shortlists and quotas. We've get more women in parliament by encouraging them, by breaking down barriers.

Crispin Blunt was forced to apologise after he criticised the conviction of Tory MP Imran Ahmad Khan as 'nothing short of an international scandal'. Khan, the MP for Wakefield, forced the boy to drink gin and tonic, dragged him upstairs, pushed him on to a bed and asked him to watch pornography before the attack at a house in Staffordshire in January 2008. In a statement following his conviction, Blunt said: 'I hope for the return of Imran Ahmad Khan to the public service that has exemplified his life to date. 'Any other outcome will be a stain on our reputation for justice, and an appalling own goal by Britain as we try to take a lead in reversing the Victorian era prejudice that still disfigures too much of the global statute book.'  But after deleting his initial message of support the following day, Blunt said: 'On reflection I have decided to retract my statement defending Imran Ahmad Khan.   'I am sorry that my defence of him has been a cause of significant upset and concern not least to victims of sexual offences. It was not my intention to do this.'  Khan has since announced that he is standing down as an MP. In a statement posted on his website, Blunt - who was first elected as MP for Reigate in 1997 - made no reference to the furore as he announced he would stand down at the next election. He said: 'This statement is not the place for the tale of the ensuing 25 years, that may or may not follow when this particular parliamentary journey is concluded. But its purpose is to use this 25th anniversary to make public, what those closest to me have known privately for some time, that after seven increasingly tumultuous parliaments, this will be my last.' Blunt added: 'In looking forward to the next two years or so of this parliament, whilst securing my re-election is no longer an interest, there will be continued joy in representing the citizens I've had the honour to serve for 25 years.  'I still enjoy the personal motivation to do this to the best of my ability, using my experience in their interests, individual and collective; to help secure the future of the party that has given me this opportunity; and to also continue to call out long established populist views on policy shibboleths that continue to cause damage to our society and beyond.

That's the damning finding in the largest ever survey of menopausal and perimenopausal women in the UK, which reveals a shocking lack of support for this demographic, who are routinely being ignored or bullied the workplace. The survey of more than 4,000 women aged 45-55 was commissioned by Channel 4 as part of Davina McCall's new documentary Sex, Mind & The Menopause - a follow-up to her agenda-pushing 2021 documentary Sex, Myths & The Menopause, in which the TV presenter shared her own experience and debunked some of the longstanding myths surrounding hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The latest programme focuses on the mind, exposing how memory loss and brain fog that begin during perimenopause as early as your 40s are pushing women out of work. The survey data has been analysed by the Fawcett Society, and a landmark report produced to lay bare the facts and crucial next steps.  The majority of women surveyed (77%) said they find at least one menopause symptom 'very difficult', while 44% of women experience three or more symptoms that are this severe. Women are most likely to say they find sleeping (84%), brain fog (73%), and anxiety or depression (69%) are difficult. The majority (eight in 10) of menopausal women say their workplace has no basic support in place for them - no support networks (79%), no absence policies (81%) and no information sharing with staff (79%). And the report uncovers the stigma many women face, with 41% saying they have seen symptoms treated as a joke by people at work. These are just a few of the quotes from anonymous women surveyed:   'I spent most of my time when I used to work with my head in a fan and colleagues laughing at my hot flushes. It was too hot in the office for me and I felt hot, sweaty and embarrassed all the time.'   'There is a stigma around the menopause in workplaces, it's a joke with most men and I don't think workplaces realise how horrible it can be.'   'I experienced being bullied at work and people not believing that my illness was real. I worked in a pharmacy, I was anxious, didn't want to go to work. It became that I didn't want to leave the house, it resulted that I walked out of my workplace and never returned.'   One in 10 women leaves a job completely under these circumstances, which equates to 333,000 women aged 45-55 in the workplace leaving their jobs due to the menopause. A further 13% of menopausal women who have been employed during menopause have considered leaving their job and 14% have reduced their hours.  The Fawcett analysis also exposes how some groups of women are disproportionately overlooked at work and in healthcare settings.  A fifth (21%) of women who have to wear uniform or a dress code to work say it is uncomfortable given their symptoms, rising to 28% among working class women.  Almost half (45%) of Black and minoritised women say it took many appointments for their GP to realise they were experiencing the menopause, compared to 30% of white women. And 22% of disabled women who have been employed during the menopause said they had left a job due to their symptoms compared to 9% for non-disabled women.  In this environment of stigma, almost half (45%) of women surveyed haven't spoken to their GP surgery about their symptoms. Of the women who have approached their surgery, 31% said it took many appointments before their GP realised they were experiencing menopause or perimenopause. Official guidance says that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) should be offered to women who are struggling with menopause symptoms, but just 39% of women say their GP or nurse offered HRT as soon as they knew they were experiencing menopause, and only 14% of menopausal women said that they are currently taking HRT. Recent HRT shortages have been widely reported as being due to increased demand - but this evidence suggests that we are only seeing the beginning of the potential rise in uptake. In light of the findings, the report recommends amending the Equality Act 2010 to ensure menopausal women are protected from discrimination at work. It also urges employers to create action plans on menopause and says the government should make flexible working the default.  Commenting on the findings, MP Carolyn Harris said: 'Women aren't asking for a lot - we make up 51% of the population and we all go through the menopause. But too many doctors are still out there prescribing antidepressants instead of HRT because they aren't getting sufficient training and they haven't got up to date information. And, whilst there are pockets of really good practice out there, too few employers are providing any form of support for the women who work for them. 'This is a big issue, and we need big solutions - but they don't need to be expensive or particularly complex. 'Women need the right information and support and for them to get that we need to ensure that medical professionals and employees are also getting the right information and support too - it's not that difficult to do.'

In another, the couple can be seen relaxing on a sunbathed yacht. 'I love you so much @davidbeckham you are the most incredible husband anyone could wish for and I feel truly blessed.  'You are my everything x I love you so so much x happy birthday,' she wrote.

'We all love you so much!! So many kisses from us all!!! Kisses @brooklynpeltzbeckham @romeobeckham @cruzbeckham #HarperSeven' Romeo Beckham also shared a snap of him with his famous dad on Instagram and wished him a happy birthday, 'HAPPY BIRTHDAY DAD, I love you so much thank you for everything, have the best day,' the 19-year-old wrote. David's birthday celebrations kicked off early on Saturday as his family gathered to help him mark the occasion over the Bank Holiday Weekend in London.  The star was treated to donuts and red wine as friends and family, including dad Ted, sang happy birthday to him at Guy Ritchie's Lore of the Land pub in London's Fitzrovia. Last month David and Victoria helped their eldest son Brooklyn celebrate as he married his American girlfriend, Nicola Peltz.  The couple went all out when it came to choosing a wedding gift for the newlyweds, which saw them splashing some serious cash on the young couple.

But often they are caught in a revolving door of repeat offending. This is hugely expensive for the taxpayer, highly disruptive for the children of women offenders, and doesn't work to tackle the root causes of women's offending. Many struggle with substance misuse or poor mental health. Some are coerced by a partner to commit crime or have themselves been the victims of abuse. Some commit crimes because they don't have enough money to pay the bills, or face homelessness on release. So when the government announced its female offender strategy in 2018, aiming to reduce the number of women in prison especially on short sentences, provide support on release from prison, and increase the proportion of women managed in the community, it was widely welcomed. But the Public Accounts Committee found that no meaningful progress has been made to implement the strategy. Worse, while PS200 million has been committed for 500 more places in women's prisons, only PS9.5 million has been spent on community solutions since 2018. Perhaps the relatively small number of women in custody has left the issue on the back burner. But the government's failure to prioritise the investment needed overlooks the ruinous financial, social and human costs of keeping women in custody. That's why we've said the Ministry of Justice must urgently assess the funding needed to improve outcomes for women and increase community provision. It must also publish what it aims to deliver, with an action plan and performance measures so that it can be held to account for progress. Implementing the strategy across government, and in partnership with specialist organisations, could transform the prospects of female offenders - and secure better value for the taxpayer.

'I've been so careful with myself that my own friends make fun of me,' the talk show legend told the Los Angeles Times in a lengthy interview. 'I didn't leave home for 322 days -- literally did not leave the house.' But the near-year spent at her sprawling California estate -- nicknamed 'The Promised Land' -- was no hardship. 'What has surprised me the most is how well I was able to adjust to the isolation and not being around other people,' Oprah said. 'I remember one point [Gayle King] said, 'Don't you just miss being around other people?' I go, 'Eh, not really.'' She believes part of the reason she adjusted so well is that it balanced out the years of intense social interaction her long career has brought her. 'I was in an audience of 350 people twice a day, so I've had shaking hands and autographs and selfies, and lots of attention, and exposure to being around a lot of people,' she said. But when she started staying home, she was 'able to be with myself in a way that I haven't been able to for years, because usually, even if I take time off for myself, I'm thinking about what is the next thing to come.' Oprah, a billionaire, acknowledged that she has a 'very blessed and privileged life,' and that a huge part of why she was able to embrace isolation is that she didn't have to worry about where her 'next paycheck' was coming from. She also wasn't totally alone for all 322 days. For one thing, she had longtime partner Stedman Graham, though he did famously quarantine in the guesthouse for two weeks at the beginning of the pandemic. She was also visited by close friend Gayle King -- along with King's team at CBS This Morning -- whom she also put on strict quarantine protocol. Oprah was talking to the Times to promote The Color of Care, a new documentary she executive-produced about the Covid-19 pandemic and racial disparities in the health care system. She was inspired to make the documentary after reading about Gary Fowler, a Black man who died of COVID in the spring of 2020 after multiple hospitals refused to help him. She was 'haunted' by the story and a photograph of Fowler, she told the Detroit Free Press, which was the first news outlet to cover the story.

Pearl - one of two projects announced as part of Harry and Meghan's Netflix deal - was set to focus on the adventures of a 12-year-old girl inspired by influential women from history. The Duchess of Sussex was to serve as an executive producer of the series alongside David Furnish - filmmaker and husband of Sir Elton John.   Pearl has been axed by Netflix as part of strategic decisions the streaming giant is making around animated series. It is understood Netflix has decided not to move forward with development on several projects, one of which is Pearl. This is believed to be not uncommon for development, and Netflix recently decided not to move forward with other animated series. Harry and Meghan signed a multimillion-pound deal with Netflix in 2020. The news that Pearl is being dropped comes after it emerged that Netflix lost 200,000 users over the first three months of 2022, falling well short of predictions it would add 2.5 million subscribers. Netflix has stumbled in the face of increased competition from the likes of Disney, Amazon Prime and the reopening of cinemas.   The US firm has seen its share value cut in half over the past six months as investors have grown increasingly concerned by the change in fortunes. Netflix said Archewell Productions remains a valued partner and they are continuing to work together on a number of projects, including the documentary series Heart Of Invictus. The show follows people competing at the Invictus Games, and a camera crew was seen close to Harry and Meghan during their time at the event in The Hague, Netherlands, last month. When Pearl was announced last July, Meghan said: 'Like many girls her age, our heroine Pearl is on a journey of self-discovery as she tries to overcome life's daily challenges. 'I'm thrilled that Archewell Productions, partnered with the powerhouse platform of Netflix, and these incredible producers, will together bring you this new animated series, which celebrates extraordinary women throughout history. 'David Furnish and I have been eager to bring this special series to light, and I am delighted we are able to announce it today.'   According to the Archewell website, Archewell Productions was created by Harry and Meghan 'to produce programming that informs, elevates and inspires'. The website - which says Archewell Productions will 'utilise the power of storytelling to embrace our shared humanity and duty to truth through a compassionate lens' - lists Heart Of Invictus and Pearl as the two 'exciting projects' it has announced.", "1c92642c9239d43026e52d8a21940c7310efbe0128fc8c794c0f5814": "John Whaite has spoken of his disappointment after it was announced that Cinderella will close before he's had the chance to make his stage debut in the West End musical. The former Strictly Come Dancing star was due to join the cast of the Andrew Lloyd Webber production as Prince Charming, however, the show will end next month, less than a year after its premiere. Cinderella, which has been playing at London's Gillian Lynne Theatre, has been hit with Covid-19 related disruption since the start, will play its final performance on 12 June. Responding to the announcement that the musical will close, former Bake Off champ John wrote on Instagram: 'This is heartbreaking news for me because I was due to take the role of Prince Charming in July, but more so for the current cast, band and production who have battled through Covid to bring a brilliant new show to the stage. 'My heart goes out to each and every one of them.' He continued: 'I was lucky enough to watch Cinderella in December 2021 and it was one of the most wonderful musicals I've seen in a long time. 'I was so excited to join the cast, and it was a lifelong dream come true, but sadly it isn't to be right now. Who knows what the future will hold - I won't lose hope.' The Cinderella premiere took place in August last year, having been scheduled to debut the previous month but was delayed due to Covid isolation protocols. The show opened with an audience capacity of 50% after the Lloyd Webber rejected Boris Johnson's offer for the show to be included in the coronavirus live events pilot scheme. Then in December, Cinderella was stopped due to 'Covid-related absences', alongside London productions of hit musicals Hamilton and The Lion King. At the time, Lloyd Webber said it is 'simply heartbreaking' to see the theatre industry 'decimated' by Omicron cancellations, adding 'no-one in the Government listens'. He postponed Cinderella until 2022 'to avoid more disruption' as the number of Covid-19 cases increased across the country. Written by The Crown star Emerald Fennell and starring Carrie Hope Fletcher, Cinderella is described as a 'complete reinvention' of the classic fairytale, and is based on an original idea by Fennell.

Parish announced his resignation as MP for Tiverton and Honiton on Saturday he was seen watching porn in parliament. The revelation was the latest in a series of reports about sexism and harassment in Westminster. Caroline Nokes, the Tory chair of the Commons women and equalities committee, has told The Times it would be a start if her party 'made sure' its candidate in the by-election was a woman. But Michelle Donelan rejected the idea of the party having an all-women shortlist in the seat. 'I've never been in favour of shortlists and quotas,' she told Sky News. 'We get more women in parliament by encouraging them, by breaking down barriers. 'We don't do it by putting in quotas which I find quite demeaning to women.' The minister said women could become MPs 'on merit', adding both female prime ministers had been Conservatives. Donelan added the MPs guilty of sexist or abusive behaviour were 'misogynistic dinosaurs'. Labour uses all-women shortlists in some seats to make sure more of its candidates are female. Current high-profile politicians -- including Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner and MPs Jess Phillips and Stella Creasy -- have all been selected under the system. Oliver Dowden, the Tory chairman, has said half of Conservative MPs should be women given 'half the population are women'. But the party has stopped short of using all-women shortlists to increase the number of women Tory MPs. Out of the 359 Conservatives, just 87 are women. But of Labour's 199 MPs, 104 are women and 95 are men. Cabinet minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan last week described once being 'pinned up against a wall' by a former MP. Attorney General Suella Braverman said some men in Westminster act like 'animals'. The Sunday Times reported drunken and disorderly behaviour, including a senior MP accused of repeatedly licking the faces of young male staff in parliamentary bars.

'How would you fit a giraffe into a fridge?' An asinine question in most settings, but especially peculiar during a job interview.  And yet, these kinds of 'quirky' and arbitrary lines of questioning seem to be commonplace during the interview process. In an attempt to make people think 'outside the box' or on their feet, hiring managers are coming up with increasingly difficult (and frustrating) tasks and questions for interviewees. And to make matters worse, many are leaving the applicants hanging once it comes to feedback or finding out the results of the conversation.  So, what does it say about their work culture when recruiting staff act like this when imbued with such powers? For starters, if you're being put in a difficult and tricky situation at the earliest stage of the job, then it might not be the best indication of the company's treatment of employees. And it also means they have no regard to the preparation that applicants may have completed in anticipation of a more traditional interview. After all, how does anyone answer how they'd put a giraffe in the fridge, or what words they'd have on their tombstone, or how they'd fare if locked in a room and asked to complete a challenge (all real requests)? Here are some of the most ridiculous requests people have received: It's understandable that companies would try get creative with their asks, and indeed some are known for tough brainteasers that showcase the best of people, but most of us can agree that some questions are just a bit bizarre and show nothing about the person.  That's what Hannah Langford, 31, from the North West, felt when she went for a job in law in Manchester. She tells HuffPost: 'I had a training contract interview at a law firm about 10 years ago and was asked two bizarre questions: 'Why don't polar bears eat penguins?' and 'How much water does it take to fill St Paul's Cathedral?'. 'These questions made me doubt myself and I felt confused as to what answer was expected (i.e., was I expected to give an actual answer to the water question or was my thought process what they were interested in?).' Langford ended up pivoting to a different sector altogether, deciding to work in charity.  Ramla*, 26, from London, can relate to navigating random questions that don't relate to the job. 'A charity that had many interview stages (and didn't even give feedback after despite saying it would) had some interesting questions,' she recalls. 'One was about who's your most problematic friend and why you are still friends with them. Another was about the last time you lost your temper. 'I'm not sure how far these questions really test someone's values. No matter what you say, they'd have to take it with a pinch of salt because it's an interview, not a chat with your best friend. 'These questions felt a bit like an interrogation. Surely what I've achieved and the places in which I've created transformative change should speak for itself - or at the very least, they could ask me directly about that?' Unfortunately, eccentric questioning seems to be commonplace in the job interview space, when that time could be far better utilised talking about the things that bring us joy, what we're passionate about, what we look forward to.

Bryant told LBC Radio: 'I remember when I came in, in 2001, I was regularly touched up by older, senior gay - well, they weren't out but - MPs.

Sir Lindsay said: 'I take recent allegations of bullying and sexual impropriety, comments and advances very seriously, which is why it is time we reviewed our working practices, particularly whether it is right that individual MPs are the employers of their staff. 'The question is: should someone else - or an outside body - employ the staff, as long as the MP has the right to choose them?'

Just days after Rishi Sunak hinted oil and gas providers could face a tax on their bumper profits, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng slapped down the idea.  The government is facing calls to impose a levy on leading energy companies, as BP and Shell are expected to unveil big payouts for shareholders this week. Labour and the Lib Dems are both demanding a windfall tax on energy companies to help families struggling with the cost of living crisis. However, Kwasi Kwarteng criticised the idea, despite the Chancellor not ruling out such a move. Kwarteng told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday: 'I've never been a supporter of windfall taxes, I've been very clear about that publicly. I think they discourage investment.' He described such a tax as 'arbitrary and unexpected' although he did refuse to rule out the government imposing one in future. Pressed on whether the government had ruled out a windfall tax, Kwarteng told the BBC: 'I am not going to be here on the programme ruling out what the Chancellor is going to do or isn't going to do in an October budget. That is not my job.' It comes after Sunak hinted at a possible U-turn on a tax on oil and gas providers, having repeatedly refused to consider the idea. He suggested that he would consider a windfall tax on the industry if it failed to ramp up investment in new energy projects. Speaking to Mumsnet, Sunak said he had not gone down the road of a windfall tax because he did not want to put off investment in new oil and gas extraction, highlighting a recent PS25 billion investment by one company in the North Sea. But he added: 'What I would say is that if we don't see that type of investment coming forward and companies are not going to make those investments in our country and energy security, then of course that's something I would look at and nothing is ever off the table in these things.' Kwarteng wrote to BP and Shell last week demanding a 'very clear plan' from them within weeks to reinvest profits. They are expected to present what is likely to be their best set of results for years while facing calls to cough up more in tax.

Kwasi Kwarteng instead blamed the long intense hours in Westminster when quizzed about the mounting allegations surrounding MPs' conduct.  It comes after Tory MP Neil Parish stood down after he was allegedly seen by two female MPs watching pornography on his phone in the House of Commons chamber. It prompted senior Tory MP Caroline Nokes to say her party is institutionally sexist and that there was a culture of 'male entitlement' in the party. But Business Secretary Kwarteng told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday: 'I don't think there's a culture of misogyny, I think the problem we have is that people are working in a really intense environment, there are long hours. 'And I think generally most people know their limits. They know how to act respectfully, but there are some instances where people don't frankly act according to the highest standards.' Kwarteng said Parish did the 'right thing' by resigning and added: 'He did something which in most other professions, you would be sacked for doing and he voluntarily resigned and I think his position was very difficult.'

The former party boss, who has been left out in the cold by successive Labour leaders since leaving office in 2007, said it now had 'a renewed sense of purpose and mission' ahead of Thursday's local elections. It is thought to be the first time Blair has appeared on an official Labour Party broadcast since quitting as leader. In the two-minute video, he lists his government's achievements, including the introduction of the minimum wage, tackling poverty, improving education standards, reducing NHS waiting lists and bringing peace to Northern Ireland. Blair, who led Labour to three general election victories, said: 'Today, just as in 1997, we have renewed leadership and a renewed sense of purpose and mission. 'Keir Starmer has shown strength, determination and intelligence in setting Labour back on a winning path.' The video marks a significant shift in the party's attitude towards its former leader after his successors Gordon Brown, Ed Miliband and Jeremy Corbyn all sought to distance themselves from his legacy. A Labour spokesperson said: 'The 25th anniversary of the 1997 election victory is a timely reminder of what Labour can achieve in power. 'We are proud of those achievements. Tony Blair's leadership serves as an inspiration for us, as we work to deliver a Labour government that tackles the challenges of the 2020s and beyond, with security, prosperity and respect for all.'", "f7fedd79eebef470fccf998717332007c57c79a4834fac6e45fc7779": "Naga Munchetty suffered an unfortunate slip-up while presenting BBC Breakfast on Saturday, accidentally telling viewers Boris Johnson had 'just spent his first night in prison'.  The presenter was sharing news of former Wimbledon champion Boris Becker's recent prison sentence when she got confused with the prime minister.  The former tennis world number one was jailed for two-and-a-half years for hiding PS2.5 million worth of assets and loans to avoid paying his debts on Friday. As Naga told Breakfast viewers about the news, she said: 'Three-times Wimbledon champion Boris Johnson has just spent his first night in prison.' Mike Bushell was then introduced to give more background on the story, with the error not immediately corrected. Needless to say Naga's slip-up did not go unnoticed on Twitter... Becker was found guilty of four offences under the Insolvency Act between June 21 and October 3 2017 earlier this month. The former BBC commentator transferred almost 427,000 euros (around PS390,000) from his business account to others, including those of his ex-wife Barbara and estranged wife Sharlely 'Lilly' Becker. He also failed to declare his share in a PS1 million property in his home town of Leimen, Germany, hid an 825,000 euro (almost PS700,000) bank loan - worth PS1.1 million with interest - and concealed 75,000 shares in a tech firm, valued at PS66,000. Judge Deborah Taylor sentenced the six-time Grand Slam champion to two-and-a-half years imprisonment, of which he will serve half, at Southwark Crown Court on Friday.

The Labour leader flat out denied there was any agreement with the party, saying: 'Everybody knows there is no pact.' It comes after Tory chairman Oliver Dowden claimed Starmer was standing down candidates 'in swathes of the country' where Lib Dem support is strong to avoid splitting the anti-Tory vote. Dowden alleged Sir Ed Davey's party had returned the favour where Labour is dominant elsewhere. Asked about the claims, Starmer told Sky News: 'I wouldn't take anything Oliver Dowden says particularly seriously. 'The fact that he is spending his Sunday...attacking Labour...why doesn't he say something about the cost-of-living crisis for heaven's sake? 'There is no pact, everybody knows there is no pact. We will put a candidate up when there is a by-election, obviously after the Neil Parish resignation of yesterday.' Starmer went on to claim that Labour was standing more candidates than ever in the local elections. Davey also denied making a pact with Labour, saying: 'There is no pact now, there is not going to be a pact in the future.' It comes after HuffPost UK revealed the pressure Starmer is under to make gains at Thursday's election. One Labour source said: 'The big picture is we're going after the Conservatives and laying the groundwork for the next election.' A shadow minister added: 'I'm feeling pretty confident and optimistic. 'If we can't make gains now - with everything going on with the cost of living crisis and partygate - then there is something seriously wrong with us.

The pair, whose characters' wedding was watched by 20 million UK viewers in 1988, have long been rumoured to return as part of the Aussie soap's send off.  It was announced earlier this year that the show would come to an end after 37 years on air.  In a statement, Neighbours' executive producer Jason Herbison said of the beloved 80s couple: 'Scott and Charlene are the ultimate Neighbours couple and it would not feel right to end the show without them. 'We are thrilled that Jason and Kylie have come home to play a very special part in our series finale. It has been an emotional experience for them, for us and I'm sure it will be for our viewers.' A post on the show's Instagram featured pictures of a Neighbours script with Scott and Charlene's names on, with Kylie and Jason also sharing their respective halves on their accounts.  The pair have yet to speak on reprising their roles, but the news has lit up Twitter... Earlier this year, it was revealed the future of the show was in jeopardy after UK broadcaster Channel 5 announced it would stop airing Neighbours from this summer. After the search for a new UK broadcast partner proved unsuccessful, it was confirmed the show would come to an end, with a statement saying: 'We are so sorry to say that after nearly 37 years and almost 9000 episodes broadcast we have to confirm that Neighbours will cease production in June. 'Following the loss of our key broadcast partner in the UK and despite an extensive search for alternative funding, we simply have no option but to rest the show. 'To our amazing, loyal fans, we know this is a huge disappointment, as it is to all of us on the team.

Kylie and Jason, who made their last Neighbours appearances in 1988 and 1989 respectively, previously spoke out about the show's fate, with the Can't Get You Out Of My Head singer tweeting: 'I'll be forever grateful for the experience and the friends I made on Neighbours. 'We had no idea how big the show would become and how passionately viewers would take it to heart. Pure love!' She added: 'I can still hear Madge calling... CHARLENE!!!!'

You might think this friend is a bad influence because of the language they use, the way they treat other kids or speak to adults, or their attitude toward school. Maybe this friend has been mean, controlling or otherwise inconsiderate toward your child.  Whatever the reason, it can be a tricky issue to navigate. Below, parenting experts offer advice on how to handle the situation.  Do some self-reflection. First, take a little time to consider what exactly is rubbing you the wrong way about this friendship. Are your feelings warranted - or is it possible you're bringing your own baggage to the table?  'Do you dislike the child because of your personal values, prejudice or opinion?' Amy McCready, founder of Positive Parenting Solutions and author of The Me, Me, Me Epidemic, told HuffPost. 'Your child may be benefitting from this friendship or have more in common with the child than you may realise -- even if you wouldn't choose this friend for yourself.' Or perhaps your feelings toward this friend are misplaced. You think you don't like the kid when really, it's the parents you have an issue with.  'In today's charged political and social climate, parents can be faced with interacting with families that don't align with their views,' clinical psychologist Cindy T. Graham -- founder of Brighter Hope Wellness Center -- told HuffPost.  Ask your kid about the friendship Put aside your preconceived notions for a moment and have a conversation with your kid about this friend. Ask why they like hanging out with them and what they enjoy doing together. Be curious and listen to what they have to say. This requires an open heart and mind, Graham said.  'Aside from being a great opportunity to connect with your child, it gives you the chance to learn about aspects of the friend's personality, demeanour or circumstances that you may not have previously been aware of,' she said. 'For example, sometimes kids can present as immature or standoffish when under stressful situations,' Graham continued. 'Moments that trigger anxiety -- such as meeting unfamiliar adults -- can lead to behaviours that may be perceived as disrespectful.' Try also putting yourself in the kid's shoes. Think about the struggles they -- or their family -- might be facing that could be affecting their behaviour.  'Take into consideration what they may be going through or have gone through,' McCready said. 'Your own kid or family may be just what this child needs!'  Get to know the friend and their parents better Spend some time with the friend and their family -- it might show you a different side of them. Go into the experience hoping to see what your child sees in them.  'It's also helpful for the parent to be willing to get to know the family on a few different occasions,' Graham said. 'This will give everyone a greater chance of getting past the initial anxieties of making a good first impression to instead get to know one another.' Judge the behaviour, not the person If the friend in question does something you don't like, it's OK to tell your child that their behaviour concerned you. But resist making accusations or assumptions about the friend's character because of it.  'You can comment on a friend's behaviour that you disapprove of and help your child problem-solve why that behaviour may be something they shouldn't mimic,' McCready said. 'The bottom line: Judge the behaviour, not the person.'  If you think the friendship is a danger to your child, step in There's a difference between not being particularly fond of your kid's friend and feeling like this person could be a true threat to your child's safety or well-being. If it's the latter case, you should intervene immediately, McCready said.  'If you're concerned, set limits - without prohibiting the friendship,' she said. 'Keep a close eye on behaviours and offer your home as a hang-out spot to keep your eye on the kids, or set an earlier curfew when your child is hanging out with that friend.'  Look out for negative changes in your child's behaviour that could indicate the friendship is an unhealthy one. For your child, that might mean a worsening mood, a sudden change in their grades or withdrawing from activities they once enjoyed. If you notice any of these signs, 'then parents would want to look into the social dynamics with the friend more closely,' Graham said.  Talk about what it means to be a good friend. Use this situation as an opportunity to have conversations about what healthy friendships look and feel like. Discuss important qualities like trust, respect and standing up for one another.  'Highlight the differences in how you feel in a healthy friendship - inspired, accepted, safe, encouraged, hopeful, versus the emotions that come from unhealthy, toxic relationships - feeling anxious, disrespected, put out, pressured to do things you don't want to do, or like you're constantly in competition with your friend,' McCready said. Try to remember what it was like to be a kid yourself It's normal for kids and teens to go through different phases as they try to figure out who they are. 'Many kids who may have seemingly off-putting personalities are going through a phase that many of us go through,' Graham said. Consider this: When you were younger, perhaps you weren't always the kind of kid your friends' parents were thrilled about, either. Keeping that in mind 'could help you to be more kind towards your kids' friends,' Graham said.  Also, remember that your kids are growing up in a different time than you did.  'Often what was once considered unacceptable can change over time,' Graham added.  Keep things in perspective Friends come in and out of our kids' lives. Just because these two are buddy-buddy right now doesn't mean they're going to be inseparable forever (even if it feels that way).  'Understand that these may not be your child's friends for life and statistically, they probably won't be,' McCready said. 'According to a study, only one percent of friendships formed in middle school are still going strong by the 12th grade.' Agree to disagree It's a fact of life: you're not going to like everyone your kid is friends with, and that's OK. Sometimes an 'agree to disagree' approach is the best thing for the health of your relationship with your child. (As McCready pointed out, trying to forbid the friendship could create a power struggle between you and your child -- one that could push them away from you and closer to this friend.)  'There is a lot to be said for social relationships that allow a child to thrive and feel supported,' Graham said. 'As long as the friend isn't having a detrimental effect on your child, it may be best to accept that you may not always like your child's choices, including their friendships.' And remember: Even not-great friendships can turn out to be positive learning experiences for your kid. For example, it may help them figure out which qualities they value in a friend or teach them how to set and hold boundaries.  'Friendships that are less-than-ideal aren't necessarily a recipe for disaster or a path to trouble,' McCready said. 'With your open mind and willingness to offer counsel, your kids will navigate friendships with the proper support.'  This is part of a HuffPost Parents series called Enjoy the Ride. Read more here.

Yes, offices are opening back up and many people are carrying on with their events and travel plans. But there's still a layer of uncertainty about what might happen next with Covid and when the pandemic will truly end -- especially as more variants pop up. Life doesn't exactly feel normal yet, and as a result, time drags by. Here's why, and how you can 'gain' some of it back: 1. We lost our routines. According to Ruth Ogden, an experimental psychologist at Liverpool John Moores University who studies how humans process time, this sensation that time is warped has been a global phenomenon. Through her research, she's found that people across the globe have experienced distorted time during the pandemic.  The biggest culprit of the time warp: the loss of our routines. 'All the things in our day that helped us know what time it was -- they were gone. That meant it became easy for time to slip and slide around,' Ogden said. During the pandemic, time stood still for many of us. We canceled our activities and we distanced from friends. People did everything -- sleep, eat, work, socialise, parent, exercise -- from their homes.  'We're all heavily routinised creatures, but this routine is important because it keeps us in time,' Ogden said.  Our day-to-day activities help us perceive time -- if we are commuting, we know it's morning, if we're running out for lunch, it's midday, and so on and so forth. Without daily routines, which act as markers of time, it becomes easy to get lost in time. The things that made your Saturday a Saturday, or your Tuesday a Tuesday, may no longer be there. Research also suggests that emotions significantly impact our perception of time. When we're happy and physiologically aroused, time feels like it's flying by; conversely, depression can make time feel sluggish.  Furthermore, our expectations of how things will occur (i.e., the pandemic is over!) versus the reality of how things play out (there's a new variant coming for us) can make time feel faster or slower, depending on if the actual outcome was better or worse than our predictions.  2. Memories help us process time, and our memories are different from the last few years. Think back to the beginning of the pandemic, when news of Covid spreading around China first leaked. How long ago does that feel to you? Months? Years? It's probably hard to tell.  Ogden and her research team have been studying how people feel about the length of the pandemic and have discovered that the brain processes length of time through memories.  'If we've got loads of memories, then it says, 'Oh, it must have been a long time,' but if it has very few memories, then we think it must have been a short period of time,' Ogden said.  In theory, most of us should remember the pandemic as being short -- because we didn't do a lot, Ogden said. But she's found the opposite: most people feel like we've been stuck in the pandemic for much longer than we have been.  The reason, it seems, is that while we didn't necessarily form a ton of fun, new memories for a period of time, we still formed memories. We learned how to bake bread, we got into puzzles and crafts and packed our days with Zoom meetings. We navigated life through restrictions, masking and distancing; we developed new skills and fell into new routines. Time moved forward.  3. People process time differently. Just how distorted time feels varies from person to person. It ultimately depends each person's personal experience with Covid and how much the pandemic has influenced or changed their daily activities, said Nicole Dudukovic, the director of the neuroscience major at the University of Oregon. Ogden's research, for example, has found that social satisfaction is one of the biggest factors behind how people process time.  'The more socially satisfied you were, the 'quicker' the pandemic went,' Ogden said, noting that this didn't just involve being around people, like family in your household, but seeking out and enjoying social connections.  People who have engaged in 'normal life' again, and are traveling and commuting to the office and engaged in activities, are probably going to have a more normal sense of time right now. People who are at-risk and are hunkering down, along with those who are stressed about returning to pre-pandemic activities, may continue to feel disoriented about time.  'For some people, this experience will continue for a long time and that will continue to cause distortion to their experience of time,' Ogden said.  4. We're more aware of time now. Ultimately, the pandemic has made people much more aware of time. We've had more time on our hands, which has caused us to become hyper aware of time and how it's passing, Ogden said.  At the same time, we often don't remember time accurately. It's very hard for people to remember how we felt about things, like time, in the past -- it's largely influenced by how we feel about things now. Memories of how time once passed can be very inaccurate, according to Dudukovic. While it may feel like time is passing differently now, it's totally plausible that we're just misremembering how time felt pre-pandemic. 'It's possible that if you'd asked me in 2019 about how fast time was going that maybe it would be not that different from how I'm feeling about it now,' Dudukovic said.  Here's how to overcome the time warp. Ogden said it's important to recognise that we are not going to return to life before the pandemic.  'So much in the world has changed as a result of the pandemic,' she said. We've carried on and adapted to new ways of work and socialising.  One of the best ways to mitigate the feeling that we're stuck in a time warp is to create new routines.  'There's a lot of evidence to suggest that your routine, and also the number of activities that you're engaged in, that that's going to influence how you're perceiving time,' Dudukovic said.  Changing your environments -- stepping out of the house, going on walks, or even switching up the room you work in -- can trick your brain into thinking more is happening, so that time passes more regularly.  If your days blend together, save certain activities and routines for specific days of the week. 'Make your Tuesday a Tuesday because of the things you do in it,' Ogden said.  Finally, try to keep busy. The busier we are, the less we tend to focus on how time is passing.

Neil Parish admitted to the BBC on Saturday that he watched adult material parliament, claiming the first time was accidental after looking at tractors online. The select committee chairman had initially vowed to continue as MP for Tiverton and Honiton but said he would quit after recognising the 'furore' and 'damage' he was causing his family and constituency. The 65-year-old former farmer, who was first elected in 2010, said: 'The situation was, funnily enough it was tractors I was looking at, so I did get into another website with sort of a very similar name and I watched it for a bit, which I shouldn't have done. 'My crime, my most biggest crime, is that on another occasion I went in a second time, and that was deliberate. 'That was sitting waiting to vote on the side of the chamber.' In a statement, his local Conservative association in Tiverton and Honiton, Devon, said: 'We would like to take this opportunity to thank Neil Parish for his service to our communities over the past 12 years. 'We support his decision to step down as our Member of Parliament.' It means a by-election will be held in his seat - which Parish retained for the Tories at the last election with a majority of 24,239 - later this year. Tory chief whip Chris Heaton-Harris suspended Parish from the parliamentary Conservative Party on Friday afternoon - three days after female Tory MPs first raised complaints of a male colleague watching porn on his phone in the Commons chamber. Parish, a 65-year-old farmer, said he had referred himself to parliamentary commissioner for standards Kathryn Stone. On Friday afternoon, the rural affairs committee chairman said he would be continuing his 'duties' as an MP while 'cooperating fully' with investigators. He also suggested that he had opened the pornography on his phone accidentally.  His wife Sue Parish said 'it was all very embarrassing' as she told the Times she was not aware of her husband having done similar activities before. 'No. He's quite a normal guy, really. He's a lovely person. It's just so stupid,' she said.  Before being identified as the MP at the centre of the storm, Parish was asked about the allegations during an appearance on GB News earlier this week. He was non-committal on whether the suspect should have the whip removed and denied there was a large cultural problem in Westminster, despite senior Conservative colleagues having decried it as being 'shameful'. 'We've got some 650 members of parliament in what is a very intense area,' Mr Parish said. 'We are going to get people that step over the line. I don't think there's necessarily a huge culture here but I think it does have to be dealt with and dealt with seriously and that's what the whips will do.' The pornography claims followed reports that 56 MPs, including three Cabinet ministers, are facing allegations of sexual misconduct that have been referred to the ICGS. They also follow outrage over The Mail On Sunday publishing 'sexist' and disputed claims from unnamed Tory MPs that deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner tried to distract Boris Johnson with her legs during PMQs.

Earlier this month, The Sun published an article claiming Big Brother could be returning to our screens as soon as 2023, with a brand new home on ITV2.    The tabloid quoted 'a TV source' who said that ITV was 'in talks' about potentially reviving the game-changing reality show.  In a new interview with the Daily Star, Davina said she 'really hopes' to see Big Brother back on our screens. She said: '[The prospect of] Big Brother returning is very exciting. I mean, I really, really hope it comes back, and I think if it's coming back to ITV2 then that is a really good home for it. 'I'd just be interested to see how they do casting and change it up at all. It would be good to kind of just get really interesting people in the house and maybe try a different mix. So yeah, very exciting.' According to The Sun, the comeback season could potentially air on ITV2 in the autumn of next year, after that year's series of Love Island has ended.  An ITV spokesperson previously declined to comment when contacted by HuffPost UK    Big Brother and its celebrity spin-off originally ran between 2000 and 2010 on Channel 4, with Davina McCall at the helm.   After Channel 4 decided not renew the show, it moved to Channel 5 in 2011, where Ultimate Big Brother winner Brian Dowling, and later Emma Willis, took over presenting duties. Channel 5 eventually pulled the plug in 2018, announcing the news shortly before the 19th series began airing.     Emma recently addressed the possibility of hosting the show again in the future, but insisted she would 'not fight' original host Davina for the role.  'Would I go back? It depends if they would want me to,' she told the Daily Star. 'There are lots of people who could do it. I wouldn't fight Davina... No way, she's the queen.' However, recent reports have linked former Big Brother's Bit On The Side host Rylan Clark to the main presenting role.  Rylan has been extremely vocal about another channel bringing back Big Brother, even tweeting ITV2 about it as recently as 2019:  ", "ac1ed30fc29bda18df1fbbcbe5f7a4c371b121f038056ecad2dd8229": "Three-time Wimbledon champion Boris Becker has been jailed for two-and-a-half years for hiding PS2.5 million worth of assets and loans to avoid paying his debts. The former world number one, 54, was declared bankrupt on June 21 2017, owing creditors almost PS50 million, over an unpaid loan of more than PS3 million on his estate in Mallorca, Spain. BBC commentator Becker transferred almost 427,000 euros (around PS390,000) from his business account to others, including those of his ex-wife Barbara and estranged wife Sharlely 'Lilly' Becker.   The father-of-four also failed to declare his share in a PS1 million property in his home town of Leimen, Germany, hid an 825,000 euro (almost PS700,000) bank loan - worth PS1.1 million with interest - and concealed 75,000 shares in a tech firm, valued at PS66,000. Becker, who was handed a two-year suspended sentence for tax evasion and attempted tax evasion worth 1.7 million euro (around PS1.4 million) in Germany in 2002, was found guilty of four offences under the Insolvency Act between June 21 and October 3 2017 earlier this month. Judge Deborah Taylor sentenced the six-time Grand Slam champion to two-and-a-half years imprisonment, of which he will serve half, at Southwark Crown Court on Friday. Referring to his previous conviction, the judge said: 'You did not heed the warning you were given and the chance you were given by the suspended sentence and that is a significant aggravating factor.' She told Becker: 'I take into account what has been described as your fall from grace. 'You have lost your career and reputation and all of your property as a result of your bankruptcy.' But she added: 'You have not shown remorse, acceptance of your guilt and have sought to distance yourself from your offending and your bankruptcy.   'While I accept your humiliation as part of the proceedings, there has been no humility.' Becker, wearing a striped tie in the Wimbledon colours of purple and green, tied his shoelaces on his black Puma trainers but showed no emotion as he picked up his Puma bag before being taken down to the cells. He earlier arrived holding the hand of partner Lilian de Carvalho Monteiro, while his eldest son Noah was also in court. Following his retirement, the tennis star has coached current world number one tennis player Novak Djokovic, worked as a TV sports commentator for broadcasters including the BBC and acted as a brand ambassador for firms such as Puma. His barrister Jonathan Laidlaw QC said the tennis star's 'fall from grace' was 'the most public humiliation'. 'Boris Becker has literally nothing and there is also nothing to show for what was the most glittering of sporting careers and that is correctly termed as nothing short of a tragedy,' he said. 'These proceedings have destroyed his career entirely and ruined any further prospect of earning an income.   'His reputation is in tatters. 'He will not be able to find work and will have to rely on the charity of others if he is to survive.' Becker told jurors his 50 million US dollar (about PS38 million) career earnings were swallowed up by an expensive divorce to his first wife Barbara, child maintenance payments and 'expensive lifestyle commitments'. The German national, who has lived in the UK since 2012, said he was 'shocked' and 'embarrassed' when he was declared bankrupt. He claimed he had co-operated with trustees tasked with securing his assets, even offering up his wedding ring, and relied on the advisers who managed his life. However, Becker was found guilty of four charges, including removal of property, two counts of failing to disclose estate and concealing debt. Prosecutor Rebecca Chalkley said the jury had found he acted 'deliberately and dishonestly' but added: 'Even now, Mr Becker is still seeking to blame others when it was obviously his duty.' The court heard he received 1.13 million euros (about PS950,000) from the sale of a Mercedes car dealership he owned in Germany into a business account used as his 'piggy bank' for his personal expenses. They included PS7,600 on children's school fees, almost PS1,000 at Harrods, and payments made to Ralph Lauren, Porsche, Ocado and a Chelsea children's club.   He also paid 48,000 euros (around PS40,000) for an ankle operation at a private Swiss clinic and spent 6,000 euros (around PS5,000) at a luxury golf resort in China, the court heard. Becker was acquitted of 20 charges, including nine counts of failing to hand over trophies and medals from his tennis career. He said he did not know the whereabouts of the memorabilia, including the 1985 Wimbledon title that catapulted him to stardom, aged 17. Becker was also cleared of failing to declare a second German property, as well as his interest in the PS2.5 million Chelsea flat occupied by his daughter Anna Ermakova, who was conceived during Becker's infamous sexual encounter with waitress Angela Ermakova at London restaurant Nobu in 1999. Mr Laidlaw said Becker had not spent money on a 'lavish lifestyle' but used funds to pay child maintenance, lawyers, business expenses and rent. 'He was in desperate financial straits and what in essence he has done is exercised his own choice as to which creditors to pay, choosing or preferring to my monies to dependents rather than allowing the joint trustees to determine how those monies should be applied,' he added.", "12632c4ece908758bfc1040c49625d6be642a97e541fd2317e49bc85": "Spring has sprung, and our taste buds are beginning to transition away from heavy, slow-cooked stews and more toward fresh, lighter fare.

After months of awful headlines about partygate, and with the mood among Tory MPs once again turning fractious, a bad night for the Conservatives next Thursday may well be the trigger for a move to unseat the prime minister. What is less discussed, however, is how the elections are also a key test for Keir Starmer and whether he has what it takes to lead Labour to victory at the general election in two years' time. With a new poll yesterday giving Labour a nine-point lead over the Conservatives, expectations are high that the party is set to make sweeping gains on Thursday. But Starmer's internal detractors are looking for any signs that the party is stalling to confirm their suspicions that he is failing to seal the deal with voters. Here, HuffPost UK assesses where the main parties are ahead of a crucial night on May 5. The State Of The Parties A total of 6,812 council seats in England, Wales and Scotland are up for grabs on Thursday. In addition, there are also mayoral elections in South Yorkshire, Hackney, Lewisham, Newham, Tower Hamlets, Watford and Croydon, as well as the Northern Ireland Assembly election. In England, the Tories are defending 1,404 seats, Labour 2,222 and the Lib Dems 517. The rest are held by independents. In Wales, Labour hold 462 council seats, with Plaid Cymru on 208, the Conservatives on 197 and the Lib Dems on 59. More than 300 seats are held by independents. And in Scotland, the SNP have 432 seats, with the Tories second on 277, Labour on 262 and the Lib Dems on 67. Nearly 200 of Scottish councillors are independents. What's At Stake? An awful lot more than which parties will be responsible for your bin collections for the next four years. With a general election expected in 2024, this is likely to be the last big electoral test that Labour and the Tories will face before then. As such, it will act as an important barometer of the national mood and indicate which parties, if any, are starting to build up momentum as the general election draws nearer. Johnson needs to prove to his restive MPs that he is still the election winning-machine who delivered an 80-seat majority in 2019, and that the damage done to his reputation by partygate is not terminal. The stakes are arguably even higher for Starmer who, two years after becoming Labour leader, has still to convince the public that he has what it takes to lead the country. Is Starmer's Labour Working? While Labour has established a consistent poll lead in recent months, there remains a strong suspicion that it owes more to the public's dissatisfaction with the Conservatives than any great enthusiasm for the Starmer project. HuffPost UK revealed this week that the Labour leader is facing internal pressure to show voters how the party would tackle the cost of living crisis rather than focusing on the partygate scandal. At a shadow cabinet meeting, communities spokesperson Lisa Nandy said Labour risked looking 'out of touch' at a time when families across the country are struggling to make ends meet. One senior frontbencher said: 'Lisa's not alone on this. There was strong agreement in the room to focus on the cost of living.' It's clear, therefore, that Starmer's critics will be scrutinising Thursday's results to try and assess whether the public support the leader's strategy or are yet to be convinced.  What Does Success Look Like? The main problem facing Labour is that the last time these council seats were up for grabs four years ago, the party did very well, making it harder for them to make sweeping gains this time around. That said, a failure to pick up a significant number of council seats, and at least show progress in the Red Wall areas the party needs to win back if it's to stand any chance of winning in 2024, will constitute a disappointing evening for Starmer. 'It's a strange set of elections,' said one Starmer ally. '2018 was a bad night for the Tories and a very, very good one for Labour. 'So another bad night for the Tories and a good night for us isn't going to result in a lot of exciting change.' As polling gurus Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher summed up the situation in a recent article: '[Labour] will do well to avoid making standing still rather than picking up gains seem rather underwhelming when the post-mortem takes place. 'For the Conservatives, by contrast, the less dramatic the results, the more they can claim not to be suffering traditional 'mid-term blues'.' Labour sources are attempting to play down the prospect of the party seizing totemic Tory councils like Westminster and Wandsworth, but they admit that winning back Barnet is a distinct possibility. Beating the Tories into second place behind the SNP is also essential if the party is to have any hope of re-establishing an electoral foothold in its former Scottish heartland. Just as important as winning more council seats, insiders say, are signs of progress in seats currently held by the Tories in England and the SNP north of the border. 'We are also tracking where we are in about about 50-70 constituencies that would put us in government at a general election, so we will be keeping an eye on them on Thursday,' said a Labour source. 'Places like Stevenage, Wakefield, Bury and Glasgow.  'We need to beat the Tories and SNP in them.' The Tory View Unsurprisingly, the Conservatives are keen to raise the bar as high as possible for what would constitute a good night for Labour in the hope they will come nowhere near clearing it. One Tory source told HuffPost UK: 'Labour are obviously saying how difficult it's going to be to improve on 2018, but the reality is they are ahead in the polls and so should be doing well. 'It's going to be very difficult for us in certain places, especially central London and in places like Wandsworth, Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea, where the demographics are turning against us. 'Outer London is a bit better, but things are also going to be difficult in the affluent south - places like Surrey and West Oxfordshire, where Labour are doing well.' Significantly, however, the Tories are more confident of holding off Labour in the Red Wall, where partygate is not the major political issue many at Westminster believe it is. 'The question for Labour is whether they can make adequate progress in the places they lost in 2019 and need to win back next time,' the source said. 'While those voters are bothered about partygate, they're more concerned with bread and butter issues such as the cost of living. They're pissed off with the PM about partygate, but they also like what we did on vaccines and furlough.' Winning Here? Like Labour, the Lib Dems performed well in 2018, making further progress more difficult this time around.  'What we're really looking to is consolidate the gains we made in places like South Cambridgeshire, Richmond and Kingston,' a source told HuffPost UK. 'If we hold our ground and edge forward a little in other areas, it should spook a few Tory MPs.' These include Stephen Hammond in Wimbledon, where the Lib Dems launched their local election campaign. The party also wants to make progress in Wokingham, where the local MP is one Dominic Raab. The source added: 'The big picture is we're going after the Conservatives and laying the groundwork for the next election.'  The Pestminster Factor In the past week alone, unnamed Tory MPs have smeared Angela Rayner by accusing her of using her legs to distract Boris Johnson, while another has been suspended by the party for allegedly watching porn in the Commons. The timing could hardly have been worse for the Conservatives. Will voters use their ballots to register their disgust at the latest examples of Tory sleaze? Keir Starmer and Labour certainly hope so. ", "11bb4546e9dd3556e640e68425bec2e13511dd0aa461727ac3d7ffbf": "  We hope you love the products we recommend!

The select committee chairman said he would be continuing his 'duties' as an MP for Tiverton and Honiton, in Devon, while 'cooperating fully' with investigators after he had the Tory whip suspended on Friday. Asked by broadcasters if he opened something in error in the Commons, he said: 'I did, but let the inquiry look at that.' Parish, a 65-year-old farmer, said he would only consider his position after the conclusion of an inquiry, having earlier been revealed to be the subject of the allegations, ending days of speculation after the claims surfaced during a meeting of Tory MPs on Tuesday. He told reporters: 'I will not remain if I am found guilty.' Parish said he told his wife on Friday afternoon, adding: 'Of course it's embarrassing and it's embarrassing for my wife and family, so that's my main concern at the moment.' His wife Sue Parish said 'it was all very embarrassing' as she told the Times she was not aware of her husband having done similar activities before. 'No. He's quite a normal guy, really. He's a lovely person. It's just so stupid,' she said. Parish, a 65-year-old farmer, said he had referred himself to parliamentary commissioner for standards Kathryn Stone over 'an MP's use of their mobile phone in parliament'. But he vowed to continue serving his constituents and remain chairman of the rural affairs Committee despite calls to resign or at least stop attending the Commons while under investigation. 'I will be cooperating fully with any investigation, and whilst it is ongoing I will continue to perform my duties as MP for Tiverton and Honiton,' he wrote on his website.   Conservative chief whip Chris Heaton-Harris suspended Parish, who has represented his constituency since 2010, from the parliamentary Conservative Party after they talked on Friday afternoon. 'Mr Parish has been suspended from the Conservative whip pending the outcome of that investigation,' a spokesperson for Mr Heaton-Harris said. First the Tories looked to refer the matter to the independent complaints and grievance scheme, which looks into claims of bullying and sexual harassment. It is understood that process has now started after at least one witness made a referral. But a second investigation could be launched after Parish's commitment to refer himself to Stone. It was unclear what potential breach of the MPs' code of conduct he would report himself for. But it is thought one line of inquiry could be whether Parish caused 'significant damage to the reputation and integrity' of the Commons. Before being identified as the MP at the centre of the storm, Parish was asked about the allegations during an appearance on GB News earlier this week.   He was non-committal on whether the suspect should have the whip removed and denied there was a large cultural problem in Westminster, despite senior Conservative colleagues having decried it as being 'shameful'. 'We've got some 650 members of parliament in what is a very intense area,' Mr Parish said. 'We are going to get people that step over the line. I don't think there's necessarily a huge culture here but I think it does have to be dealt with and dealt with seriously and that's what the whips will do.' The pornography claims followed reports that 56 MPs, including three Cabinet ministers, are facing allegations of sexual misconduct that have been referred to the ICGS. They also follow outrage over The Mail On Sunday publishing 'sexist' and disputed claims from unnamed Tory MPs that deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner tried to distract Boris Johnson with her legs during prime minister's Questions.", "df9de477f2225d736ab50e7ff5330014e12103a0bfd2cad7189a4bfc": "Neil Parish has been named as the MP alleged to have been watching pornography in the Commons chamber.

'Mr Parish has been suspended from the Conservative whip pending the outcome of that investigation.' Parish, a farmer from Somerset who chairs the rural affairs select committee of MPs, was elected to the safe Devon seat of Tiverton and Honiton in 2010 after a decade in the European Parliament as an MEP. In a statement, he said: 'Following recent allegations regarding an MP's use of their mobile phone in Parliament, I have referred myself to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards in the House of Commons. 'I will be cooperating fully with any investigation, and whilst it is ongoing I will continue to perform my duties as MP for Tiverton and Honiton. 'I will not be making further comments at this stage.' Parish later suggested he may have accidentally opened a pornographic video in the Commons and said he will quit as an MP if found guilty. Asked if he opened something by error in the Commons, he told broadcasters: 'I did, but let the inquiry look at that. 'I will await the findings of the inquiry and then I will consider my position. I will not remain if I am found guilty.' He said he told his wife on Friday afternoon, adding: 'Of course it's embarrassing and it's embarrassing for my wife and family so that's my main concern at the moment.' Labour said the Tories had known about Parish's alleged conduct for days, but had done nothing about it. Thangam Debbonaire, Labour's shadow leader of the House of Commons, said: 'The Conservatives knew for days about the disgusting behaviour of one of their MPs and tried to cover it up. 'From the Owen Paterson scandal to their failure to act against their paedophile MP Imran Ahmad Khan, this is a government rotting from the head down. Britain deserves better.' Earlier in the week, Parish appeared on GB News before his name was made public, where he was asked about the incident. He was asked whether the MP in question should have the whip removed, and responded: 'I think the whips office will do a thorough investigation and we will wait and see that result and I think from that then the decision will have to be made what action will be taken. He then denied there was a large cultural problem in Westminster, despite senior Conservative colleagues having decried it as being 'shameful'.

Deputy leader Daisy Cooper said: 'If Boris Johnson had any shred of decency left, he would tell Neil Parish to resign immediately. 'In any other workplace this would count as gross misconduct and the person responsible would lose their job. Parliament should be no different.

Conservative hopefuls across the country have chosen not to use the prime minister's image as his poll ratings plummet. Many are promoting themselves as 'local Conservatives' as a way of trying to distance themselves from the national party's woes. A new poll by Survation this morning gave Labour a nine-point lead over the Tories, with partygate and the cost of living crisis taking their toll on the government's fortunes. Voters across the UK will go to the polls on May 5 in what will be a key test for all the party leaders with the general election due in just two years' time. Speculation is mounting that a particularly bad night for the Conservatives could see moves to remove Johnson as leader In Ealing, 12 Tory leaflets have been sent out without using a single picture of the prime minister. In North Tyneside, local Conservative candidates have even ditched the traditional Tory blue and are urging voters to 'go green'.  Meanwhile, in Tynemouth, Conservatives are calling themselves 'local councillors' and issuing leaflets in Labour red in an apparent attempt to disassociate themselves from their own party. Leaflets being put through voters' doors in Redbridge feature pictures of local MP and former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith rather than Johnson. And in Leeds, the Conservative leader on the city council makes no mention of the party on his mailshot to voters. Other areas where the PM's image is notable by its absence include Bromley,Southampton, Reading, Lewisham and Tunbridge Wells. Shabana Mahmood MP, Labour's elections co-ordinator, said: 'From Exeter to Tyneside, you can't find a single Tory leaflet with Boris Johnson's face on it. 'But pretending the PM doesn't exist can't help them hide from his disastrous handling of the cost of living crisis, which will see households across the country PS2620 worse off this year.'

Party whips are under increasing pressure to suspend the MP but have so far left allegations to be dealt with by an independent complaints process.  The probe, by the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS), could last for years and will allow the accused MP to remain anonymous.  Now the party is facing accusations that it is 'shamelessly' dragging its feet and 'hiding behind process'. Anneliese Dodds, chair of the Labour Party, said it was 'inexplicable' that the Conservative Party was 'refusing to take action' against their MP. 'The Conservatives already know who this person is,' she added. 'If this happened in any other workplace they'd be sacked. Boris Johnson needs to take action today.' Wera Hobhouse, the Lib Dem women and equalities spokesperson, said: 'The Conservatives are shamelessly dragging their feet. They would rather hide behind process and allow this toxic behaviour to go unpunished instead of standing up for women. 'Enough is enough. Tory whips know who did it - they need to stop protecting him and come clean on who it is so he can face justice.' One Tory MP Nickie Aiken said the individual should resign because they were causing 'pain, suffering and embarrassment' to the Tory party and parliament.  Meanwhile, her colleague Caroline Nokes said she was 'disappointed' that party whips had not already suspended him. The chair of the women and equalities select committee told PoliticsHome the decision to refer the allegations to the ICGS showed the government was 'kicking it into the long grass'. It comes after separate claims that 56 MPs are currently facing sexual misconduct investigations, including three cabinet ministers and two shadow cabinet ministers. Asked about sexism she had faced in parliament, cabinet minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan today revealed she was once pinned up against a wall by a male MP. She told LBC some of the sexism she had faced included: 'A number of years ago being pinned up against a wall by a male MP who is now no longer in the house, I'm pleased to say, declaring that I must want him because he was a powerful man.'  The Tory party's chief whip Chris Heaton-Harris has called for the case to be referred to parliament's Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS) which investigates allegations of harassment and sexual misconduct.   The disciplinary process could lead to a recommendation that the MP is suspended or forced out of the commons if a complaint is upheld.  The Conservative Party has been approached for comment.

Often unprovoked, the couple share details of their relationship that we didn't ask for. Recently Fox shared that they occasionally drink each other's blood.   Fox announced the engagement -- and the blood consumption -- in an Instagram post in January. There was immediate outcry from various medical experts like Dr Shikha Jain, a Chicago-based haematologist and oncologist.  Jain told Glamour UK back in January that 'it is absolutely not safe to drink other people's blood'. The doctor added that there's a risk of contracting a blood-borne pathogen or infection.   Now, Fox says she probably didn't give people an accurate description of the blood-drinking process. 'So, I guess to drink each other's blood might mislead people or people are imagining us with goblets and we're like 'Game of Thrones' drinking each other's blood,' she told the magazine. She said the amount of blood they drink from each other is 'just a few drops,' but admitted: 'We do consume each other's blood on occasion for ritual purposes only.'  It might sound a little unique, but we don't want to kink-shame now. After all, kissing on the mouth and swapping saliva would be considered gross in some other cultures. Also, there's a whole vampirisim community who practice this ritual. But in case you're wondering, are there any medical effects of consuming someone else's blood? We found out.  Giulia Guerrini, a health practitioner at digital pharmacy Medino, commented that it's not the first time vampirism has been in the spotlight. 'Just like before thanks to the craze of Twilight, Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly have brought vampirism into the spotlight. If you also like to perform Wicca rituals like this or participate in consensual vampirism as part of sex play, there's no shame - but like with most kinks, anyone with a desire to participate or already actively participating should be aware of all the potential risks involved. Drinking someone else's blood can be very dangerous.' Guerrini mentions that there are some conditions to be aware of, no matter how little the risk. 'There's an incredibly serious risk of contracting a blood-borne disease by drinking your partner's blood. I wouldn't recommend drinking your partner or anyone else's blood, but if you want to do it anyway, at least seek medical assurances first that they (and you, if it's being reciprocated!) aren't carrying any blood-borne diseases. HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, malaria and syphilis are all potentially life-threatening and not fun to deal with.' She says there are other conditions to be aware of such as haemochromatosis, which occurs when you intake too much iron. Our bodies struggle to naturally discard any excess iron, and human blood is very rich in iron. 'Drinking a few drops of human blood is unlikely to cause haemochromatosis, but keep in mind that haemochromatosis can cause damage to your endocrine glands, heart, joints, liver and pancreas, as well as dehydration and low blood pressure. It can also cause fluid to accumulate in your lungs.' There are other rarer conditions too, to be mindful of. 'Clinically, there's also the rare mental health condition of Renfield Syndrome, which is conveniently named after the fictional character R. M. Renfield in the Dracula novel. Renfield Syndrome is a compulsive order where you believe that you have a biological need to drink animal or human blood in order to maintain your health and vitality.' Whatever your kinks, just make sure it's, safe, consensual and appealing to all involved.

The comedian and presenter announced in 2021 that the then-upcoming season of her show would be the last, saying at the time she felt she needed 'something new to challenge me'. Her announcement came after a year of controversy over an alleged toxic workplace environment, though she has maintained this was not the reason for ending her show. On Thursday, Ellen posted a snap of herself on set on her Instagram page, writing: 'Today we taped the final episode of The Ellen Show which airs on 26 May. 'When we started this show in 2003, the iPhone didn't exist. Social Media didn't exist. Gay marriage wasn't legal. We watched the world change, sometimes for the better, sometimes not. 'But whatever was happening, my goal was always for the show to be a place where we could all come together and laugh for an hour.' She continued: 'Being invited into your lives has been the greatest privilege of my life and has brought me incredible joy. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.' Ellen previously said of her decision to end The Ellen Show: 'It's going to be really hard on the last day, but I also know it's time. I'm a creative person, and when you're a creative person you constantly need to be challenged, which is why I decided to host the Oscars or why I decided to go back to stand-up when I didn't think I would. 'I just needed something to challenge me. And as great as this show is, and as fun as it is, it's just not a challenge anymore. I need something new to challenge me.' The news came in the wake of July 2020 reports of a 'toxic' work culture on the show. BuzzFeed News spoke with 36 anonymous ex-staffers, all of whom shared stories of the improper treatment they experienced or witnessed on set. Three producers left the show amid the allegations of 'sexual misconduct and racially insensitive remarks'. Ellen apologised to staff after an internal review by Warner Bros found 'deficiencies related to the show's day-to-day management'. Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, Ellen insisted these allegations didn't impact the show or the decision to end it, but that they 'almost' did. 'It was very hurtful to me. I mean, very,' she said.

On Thursday evening, James confirmed his plans to step down as host of the US talk show in 2023 - with some fans rushing to point out that this was the same year a new series of Doctor Who would be launching, with a new actor in the lead role. This speculation was then bolstered by James' fellow US talk show host Stephen Colbert, who tweeted: 'Congratulations, James, on what will be eight incredible years at CBS. 12:30 won't be the same without you. 'But looking forward to your exciting adventures as the new Doctor Who!'  Talk about stirring the pot. While many interpreted Stephen's comments as a joke, others took it more seriously, leading to quite the reaction from fans - both for and against the possibility of James taking over at the helm of the Tardis... HuffPost UK contacted James' representatives for comment, who had no official statement, but suggested Stephen's tweet had been intended as a joke. James has actually appeared in two episodes of the BBC sci-fi show in the past, playing Craig Owens, a flatmate of Matt Smith's Doctor. Announcing his exit from The Late, Late Show on Thursday evening, James said: 'Seven and half years ago I started hosting this show and there's no other way to put it, it has changed my life. 'I love it, I love all the people that work here, I am so proud of what we've achieved, it's been beyond my wildest, wildest dreams. When I started this journey it was always going to be just that, a journey, an adventure. 'I never saw as it as my final destination, and I never want this show to overstay its welcome, I love making it and I really think in a year from now that will be a good time to move on and see what's out there.' He will step down as host for good in the summer of 2023. During his tenure as host, he's interviewed a range of A-list celebrities, had former First Lady Michelle Obama appear in a comedy sketch and made his recurring Carpool Karaoke skits a viral sensation.

Turns out you might not need as much as you think. According to a major new study by Cambridge University, the magic number for good health is actually seven hours a night - not more, not less. The research, which looked at nearly 500,000 adults between the ages of 38 and 73, found that getting too much sleep - as well as too little - was linked with worse mental health, such as anxiety and depression, as well as poorer brain performance. Those who got seven hours a night performed best in tests that required memory and problem-solving, visual attention and speed processing. 'For every hour that you moved away from seven hours you got worse,' said Barbara Sahakian, Professor of Clinical Neuropsychology at Cambridge University, of the research findings. Scientists looked at brain imaging and genetic data from the UK Biobank for 40,000 participants and found the key to good sleep was consistency. In participants who got too much or little sleep, the part of the brain that included the hippocampus, which deals in memory, was found to be smaller. 'It's very clear that the processes that go on in our brain during sleep are very important for maintaining our physical and mental health,' said Prof. Sahakian. Whatever our age, sleep is 'as important as exercise' for good health, she added, but especially as we get older.", "15b58c3fde51e8f1cde7e642989aef38289ddae6d6be6fd3356cdd93": "Game Of Thrones actor Rose Leslie has opened up about her husband and former co-star Kit Harington's past alcohol abuse issues, saying in a new interview that he'd be 'in a very different headspace right now' had he not entered rehab. 'For Kit, being an addict, it's very important for him to recognise himself as such,' Rose told Harper's Bazaar UK . 'The AA community has provided such a loving space for him to feel heard, to make sure he's not alone,' she continued. 'But if it weren't for rehab, he would be in a very different headspace right now.' Rose and Kit married in 2018. He sought treatment in 2019 following the end of Game Of Thrones, the HBO fantasy drama that propelled both of them to worldwide fame. The couple welcomed their first child, a boy, last year. In a recent interview with The Sunday Times about his treatment, Kit recalled going 'through some pretty horrible stuff' after the conclusion of the hit show. 'Things that have happened to me since Thrones ended, and that were happening during Thrones, were of a pretty traumatic nature and they did include alcohol,' he said at the time. 'You get to a place where you feel like you are a bad person, you feel like you are a shameful person. And you feel that there's no way out, that's just who you are. And getting sober is the process of going, 'No, I can change.'' Now three years on, Rose told Harper's Bazaar UK that she was 'doing well' but it wasn't on her to police her husband. 'I've learnt a lot about addiction and it's something Kit is forever going to be aware of, but it's on him whether he chooses to drink again,' she said.

But some of us hold on to these mistakes longer than others.  Maybe you lie awake at night still feeling queasy and anxious over the way you frustrated a client by accidentally giving them the wrong information. Maybe you are avoiding co-workers on your team because you feel like they are all judging you for that error, even though it happened last week. If either of these scenarios sounds familiar, you may be prone to obsessing over mistakes. What fuels these constant worries is the shame of feeling completely inadequate and fear of others discovering your lack of capabilities, says Tanisha Ranger, a Nevada-based clinical psychologist. Once you start obsessing over mistakes because of your shame, it can steamroll into bigger problems like perfectionism. 'Shame often gives way to perfectionism, and perfectionism makes mistakes feel monumental. Essentially, 'If I don't do everything perfectly right then I am a failure and everyone will see my defectiveness,'' she says. 'I've had many clients who struggled with obsessing over mistakes at work. [They lay] awake at night ruminating and beating themselves up over a mistake, not an intentional or careless mess-up, but a mistake.' There's a better way to acknowledge a mistake while still letting it go. Here's how: 1. Put the mistake in perspective After you make an obvious mistake at work, you may want the ground to swallow you up to save you from the embarrassment, shame and anxiety of facing your co-workers again. If these worries are keeping you up at night, challenge those thoughts by getting more realistic with your thinking, suggests Shannon Garcia, a psychotherapist at States of Wellness Counselling. 'Will the world end? Nope,' she says. 'Will you get fired? Highly unlikely. Will you receive constructive feedback from your boss? Maybe. Will owning up to your mistake be uncomfortable? Probably. Have you survived past mistakes? Seems like it, if you're reading this. Will you survive this one? Yes!' Sometimes accidental oversights do hurt your job performance, but it's important to not catastrophise what happened. 'Sure, it caused a delay. Yes, it may have cost the company some money. OK, it negatively impacted job performance. But is it actually the end of your career? Really? Likely not,' says Ranger. 'Shrinking things down to their right size, not ignoring/suppressing and also not overblowing or exaggerating, is an important part of letting things go.' If it helps, try putting yourself in the shoes of co-workers who have also made mistakes. Once you see the compassion and sympathy you hold for their slip-ups, you may be more inclined to be compassionate about your own. 'When a co-worker has made a mistake in the past, is it something you've judged them immensely for? Did you spend your day thinking endlessly about their mistake? No. People at work are likely reacting the same way,' Garcia says. 'No one is thinking about this more than you are.' 2. Learn that you don't have to beat yourself up as penance To move past a mistake, you also need to rethink what it means to learn from a mistake. If you think turning over every angle of how an interaction with your boss could have gone better, for example, take a deep breath. Give yourself permission to release those thoughts, says organisational psychologist Laura Gallaher of the consulting firm Gallaher Edge. People ruminate because they believe there are payoffs to worrying so much; they think 'A conscientious person would worry about this,' Gallaher says. 'When you know that you can simultaneously be a conscientious person, and also forgive yourself to move forward, it will be easier to do so.' What Garcia tells her clients the most is 'be nice to yourself,' she says. Reframe your worries in a more positive light. 'The fact that you are anxious about it means you care. That's what your boss, co-workers and customers care about the most,' Garcia says. 'Try not to beat yourself up over it. Create an affirmation to repeat to yourself whenever those negative self-talk thoughts pop up: 'I accept my mistake, I choose to learn from it, and I am moving forward.'' If you are stuck in the world of 'could've/should've' in regards to your error, be honest with yourself about what you did not know. Ranger says she works with some clients by asking them to consider why they supposedly 'should have known better.' 'It's always so enticing to impose our current knowledge and wisdom on a past version of ourselves that could not have known to make that decision with the information we had at that time,' she says.  3. Don't hide the mistake. Own what happened, but don't take on other people's judgement, too When you make a big blunder at work, you may instinctually want to shut down, repress it, and forget it ever happened.  If you feel the urge to withdraw, challenge yourself to do the opposite. Be the one to bring it up in conversation with co-workers or your boss. 'If it was something that inconvenienced them, apologise for it,' Garcia says. 'Then it's a conversation happening where you are involved, people are likely to be gracious, and everyone can move on from there.'  It may sound counterintuitive, but being transparent about your mistake and its impact can be healing. 'It can feel like a cold shower - before you do it, you fear it and feel uneasy or anxious,' Gallaher explains. 'In the moment of being open, it can feel unpleasant at first, but once it's over, you actually feel more refreshed 99% of the time. Taking accountability without blaming anybody is the most healing.' Once you model being open and accountable, it may encourage others to do so as well. 'Most of the time, when you lead with self-accountability, that vulnerability is courageous, and courage is contagious: People usually respond with their own self-accountability as well,' Gallaher says.  Of course, sometimes being honest about a mistake can also inspire eye-rolling judgement and harsh criticism from mean-spirited colleagues. You should hold yourself accountable for your mistake, but the judgement of your peers is not something you need to take on, too. 'Let them know what you intend to do differently to try to prevent something like this from happening in the future, and then accept that they may move on or they may not. It is outside of your control,' Ranger advises. 'Taking on other people's emotions is detrimental to yourself and makes it difficult for you to treat yourself with the kindness and compassion you deserve from you.'", "b55fa75338995a146f921448e847529847c1a88da62e0687d1eed5d1": "If you're watching EastEnders, you'll see that Stuart Highway has been struggling with breast cancer.

Before the storyline kicked off, Champ met with Doug Harper, 61, from London, who was diagnosed with the condition in 2011.

After showing the nipple to a GP, they sent him to hospital and ran tests on Harper, sadly confirming that it was cancer. 'As soon as I showed the nipple to the GP, their demeanour changed immediately and they booked an urgent appointment at the hospital for it to be checked out,' Harper tells HuffPost UK. 'Being told I had breast cancer was a scary and confusing time, not only for me, but also for my friends and family. But everyone was so supportive, some even made light hearted comments about the news to lift the gloom, something they knew I would appreciate.' Just like Stuart on the soap, one of the reasons Harper felt confused was because he didn't think it could be breast cancer as it's not spoken about as much in men as women. When the oncologist told him he had cancer he says he doesn't remember anything else apart from asking if he was going to die - he was told hopefully that wouldn't be the case. Since having chemotherapy treatment, Harper has become passionate about raising awareness of the condition and informing people that it can happen to anyone, regardless of gender. He is also part of a male cancer support group that he attends monthly. So when EastEnders came to him to ask about his experience, Harper was glad for the opportunity.  He tells HuffPost: 'Ricky was brilliant. While he's been playing the part, he's identified the problems that men with breast cancer can get, he just really embraced it. He came along to our group support meeting, and it was uplifting because we need more publicity for men with breast cancer.  'The storyline was really subtle, Stuart's experience of first getting diagnosed was very similar to ours, being in denial, not thinking it was happening and the shock that comes with it.' Harper mentions that the soap accurately showed how alienating the condition can be as Stuart is handed two leaflets of support for breast cancer patients - but in both, women are pictured.  Harper, who has since had chemotherapy, is in a band called Steve White & the Protest Family and has written a song about encouraging people to 'check their moobs'. He hopes more men will check themselves, saying: 'Just know that men can get it. So, check your nipples, check under your arms. And if anything looks different, it could be a cyst or what looks like a cyst on your nipple, it could be a rash, an inverted nipple, or something else under your arms, if you see it, go straight to your doctor.' He has also been working with Macmillan Cancer support. The charity's strategic advisor for treatment, Dany Bell, who has more than 30 years' experience working as a cancer nurse, added: 'Nearly 400 men are diagnosed with breast cancer every year in the UK. But we know it's still not something that is widely recognised or known by many people. 'Storylines like Stuart's in TV shows like EastEnders play such a vital role in helping to raise awareness and to make more people aware of the signs of breast cancer in both men and women. Early diagnosis can improve - and even save lives - and we hope this important plot will get more men regularly check their own chests and reaching out for help, if needed.' If you're living with cancer and need to speak to people, about the big things and small things, you can contact Macmillan Cancer Support.", "7ec0f16fb52af03de47247e16e5613156b71a1dce7d84303c431e77a": "We hope you love the products we recommend!

A research team from Stanford University said the mixture of two medications had worked well in an initial test cohort of nine women to disrupt ovulation at the time of their cycle when the chances of ovulation were highest. This has led to hopes that a 'day before' contraceptive pill could one day be made available - rather than couples relying on the daily pill, barrier protection, or in cases of unprotected sex, the 'morning after' or emergency pill. 'Emergency contraception pills work by inhibiting ovulation,' said Dr Erica Cahill, author of the Stanford research. 'These medications do not affect anything about intercourse or sperm. If they are taken near or after ovulation, they are ineffective. The best way to be effective is to take them before ovulation occurs. 'Ideally, an on-demand or pericoital pill would allow people to take a pill to prevent ovulation ahead of intercourse.' How does the 'morning after' pill work? The 'morning after' pill is a progesterone-only hormone pill that works by delaying the release of an egg from an ovary.  In the UK, there are two types of emergency pill - levonorgestrel, known as Levonelle and ulipristal acetate, known as ellaOne. As the NHS explains, you need to take the emergency pill within three days (Levonelle) or five days (ellaOne) of unprotected sex to be effective. There's usually just one pill to take and the sooner you do, the greater your chances of avoiding pregnancy. The morning after pill does not end a pregnancy that has already implanted. How might the 'day before' pill work? The days just before ovulation are known as the luteal surge, the hormonal increase that triggers ovulation. It usually starts about 36 hours beforehand. This is the most challenging time to stop the ovulation process as it's when an egg is most likely to be fertilised.  Women in the Stanford study were given a mixture of ulipristal acetate, which is currently used in the ellaOne morning-after pill, and meloxicam, a type of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Ulipristal acetate can stop ovulation but only when it's taken before the beginning of the luteal surge. Research suggests meloxicam may be able to disrupt ovulation after the luteal surge has started.  This is why the research team combined both drugs to see if they'd be able to work at a women's peak fertility.  Nine women took the combined drugs around the time of their luteal surge and then underwent ultrasound scans and had their hormone levels monitored. In six of the women, ovulation was disrupted. Eight met some criteria for incomplete ovulation. On average, their cycles were three days longer than expected.  How promising is this development? As Dr Becky Mawson at The Lowdown, a contraceptive advice platform, explains to HuffPost UK: 'Contraception works on preventing egg and sperm meeting. The idea behind the day-before contraception is delaying the egg release till after the sperm has died off and therefore can't fertilise. 'Sadly, a 'day-before' contraceptive is still very far from being used even in research setting,' she cautions, stressing the small size of the test cohort. 'We can't comment on effectiveness as it isn't being used to prevent pregnancy at moment and only in nine women. Trials will be needed of thousands of women using it to prevent pregnancy and look at failures rates.' However, Mawson believes 'any new research in the area is great. The more options available to people the more chance people will use them to prevent unwanted pregnancy if women don't want to be using a daily pill anymore.'", "1d95915e44177b6080ac87864a866bbd45654cc3ca0b2dc2bcc43925": "The Spectator magazine has faced a backlash after publishing an article where a journalist argued in favour of a man's right to 'stare at women'. Labour MP Dawn Butler called the Cosmo Landesman's piece 'creepy' and 'misogynistic' as he responded to Transport for London's poster campaign warning people against 'intrusive staring'. The campaign aims to keep women safe against 'common examples of sexual harassment', including cat calling, exposing, upskirting and touching. And posters have been put up warning: 'Intrusive staring of a sexual nature is sexual harassment and is not tolerated.' In his rebuttal, Landesman went on a Tube ride 'to stare at women', used a variety of stares from 'sexy beast' to 'pervy bloke', and argued it was 'impossible to resist the gravitational pull' of an attractive face. Landesman wrote: 'For the purposes of research I went on a Tube ride to stare at women - and yes, I know how weird that sounds. At any sign of discomfort I would immediately have stopped. But believe me, staring - sexual or otherwise - is not an easy thing to do. Most men are too wimpy to make eye contact. We are socialised not to let our eyes linger, first by our parents - 'It's rude to stare!' - and then by the #MeToo activists - 'It's sexism to stare!' 'I tried a mix of stares - my best sexy stare, my pervy bloke stare, and my just-escaped-from-the-mental-hospital stare - each for at least 30 seconds. I got one titter, one smile and one roll of the eyes. Most women did not notice I was staring. Why? Because on Tubes most women - and men - are so busy staring at their phones that they don't pay attention to what anybody else is doing.'  The article comes days after The Mail on Sunday's much-criticised report on Angela Rayner, which caused an outcry over claims the Labour deputy leader crossed and uncrossed her legs during prime minister's questions to distract Boris Johnson. The reaction was as one might expect.  But when the police force that monitors the rail network feels it has to intervene, perhaps you haven't got the tone quite right.  The British Transport Police tweeted: 'Women who've been on the receiving end of this behaviour know when it's intrusive, and we'll always take them seriously. If you're ever made to feel uncomfortable, please do text us on 61016. Oh, and please don't travel on the tube to try out your 'pervy bloke stare', thanks.'", "b572b0d6af55b8605e698fb2a8c6732fc41027f72f2c289d1b4bfde9": "Westminster was nicknamed Pestminster just five years ago due to a series of sexual misconduct accusations - and judging from the recent news, the culture in parliament has hardly improved. As POLITICO's Playbook pointed out, 'it seems every few months we go through the same charade' of shock, 'empty promises of zero tolerance' and reforms - only for the cycle to soon repeat itself. An MP suggested to the outlet that the 'culture of rule-breaking' in parliament has worsened because 'nothing happens' when MPs act out. Of course, allegations of sexism stretch back much further. The first female MP, Nancy Astor, was not even elected until 1919, which was just one year after women were even allowed to vote. But here are all the most worrying claims which have hit the headlines in just the last five years. 1. Angela Rayner's techniques of 'distraction' Over the weekend, The Mail on Sunday published a story based on claims from anonymous Tory MPs that Angela Rayner, Labour's deputy leader, was deliberately trying to distract the prime minister during PMQs. According to the report, Rayner did this by crossing and uncrossing her legs, channelling Sharon Stone's well-known scene in Basic Instinct. Rayner said she was 'crestfallen' about the sexist comments, and received support from her colleagues across the house, including Boris Johnson. However, journalists from the newspaper refused to discuss the matter with the speaker of the house Sir Lindsay Hoyle, citing freedom of the press as their defence. 2. Tory MP accused of watching porn in the Commons On Tuesday night, a female minister alleged she had seen a male Tory MP watching porn on his phone while sat next to her in the house of commons, according to reports from The Mirror and The Sun. She told Tory chief whip Chris Heaton-Harris at a meeting of the Conservative MPs. Her claim then triggered a flurry of further stories about how male MPs behave in Westminster from 14 colleagues. The Conservative Party reportedly has the name of the culprit but will not be revealing it, although it is believed not to be a frontbencher.  Downing Street has already admitted that more needs to be done to improve the culture in parliament in light of these allegations and an investigation has been launched into the this 'wholly unacceptable' behaviour. Tory peer Nicky Morgan has even suggested expelling the culprit from the party as a 'minimum'. 3. Labour MP told she is a 'secret weapon' An anonymous Welsh MP told BBC Wales that a member of the shadow cabinet allegedly described her as a 'secret weapon' and a 'vote winner'. The shadow cabinet member reportedly told their colleague this was because 'women want to be her friend' while men want to sleep with her. A Labour spokesperson said that if a complaint was put forward, it would be taken 'extremely seriously', but the MP decided it was in her best interests not to reveal her identity or make an official complaint. 4. Fifty-six MPs under investigation for sexual misconduct Approximately 70 complaints about 56 MPs were reportedly sent to parliament's Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS) according to reports from The Sunday Times. These allegations - yet to corroborated - are said to include sexual harassment claims and 'more serious wrongdoing'. 4. Tory MP suspended over sexual offences allegations Tory MP Charlie Elphicke was suspended from the Conservatives in November 2017, following accusations of sexual offences against two staff members. He then had the whip restored to him in December 2018, during Theresa May's time in office. He was then able to take part in the confidence vote in the Conservative Party's leadership. Then in 2019 he was charged with three counts of sexual assault linked to two women. He denied the charges while the party whip was withdrawn on the same day. His now estranged wife succeeded him in the next general election. In September 2020, he was sentenced two years in prison - he was released a year later. 5. Tory MP suspended over explicit texts to female constituents Andrew Griffiths resigned from his ministerial role and was suspended from the Tory Party in July 2018. It followed reports from the Sunday Mirror that he had sent 2,000 sex texts across three weeks to two female constituents. In November 2018, he told The Sunday Times that the texts were 'the result of my mental breakdown'. He later had the whip restored and was then able to take part in the same confidence vote as Elphicke over May's leadership.  He was cleared of breaching the Commons' code of conduct in September 2019 over the texts as he had not been carrying out parliamentary duties at the time. Griffiths was succeeded by his estranged wife, Kate, in the 2019 general election. In 2021, Griffiths was found to have raped and physically abused his wife during their marriage in a civil court judgment that journalists had to fight to get published. He has said that he 'strongly denied the allegations put to me'. 6. Defence secretary admits behaviour 'fell short' Michael Fallon resigned as defence secretary in November 2017 telling the BBC: 'The culture has changed over the years. What might have been acceptable 10, 15 years ago is clearly not acceptable now.' It came after journalist Julia Hartley-Brewer claimed the politician repeatedly touched her knee during a 2002 dinner. 7. Minister resigns over inquiry into misconduct allegations Damian Green resigned as the cabinet office minister in 2017 after an inquiry into claims he sexually harassed a women and looked at porn on a work computer. The probe found he breached the ministerial code, although he maintained that he did not 'download or view' the porn. 8. Labour MP suspended over inappropriate contact Labour MP Kelvin Hopkins was accused of sexual harassment towards a Labour Party activist in November 2017, according to The Daily Telegraph, and was subsequently suspended from the party. He rejected the accusations. Fellow MP Kerry McCarthy then said he had been paying her unwanted attention for years in written notes, then republished in The Guardian. He resigned from Labour in January 2021. 9. Labour MP accused of sexual harassment MP Ivan Lewis was accused of sexually harassing a 19-year-old at a Labour event, a claim he denied. The Labour Party said it 'takes all allegations of sexual harassment extremely seriously' and suspended him pending an investigation. He then quit the party in December 2018.", "9c4d5c8a0681b6763b6f42acad34d1def054d1ce28694cdb93620079": "Implementing red tape to deliver the government's own Brexit deal 'would have been an act of self harm', Jacob Rees-Mogg has said. The Brexit opportunities minister's admission come as the Tories dropped plans to impose further checks on goods entering the UK from the European Union. The change means restrictions on the imports of chilled meats from the EU and border checks on plant and animal products will not be introduced in July. Rees-Mogg said not pressing ahead with the new restrictions is 'saving British businesses up to PS1 billion in annual costs'.  When pressed about restrictions that would have actually 'cost' PS1 billion, and the idea pushed by ministers that post-Brexit checks were not going to be disruptive, he told an interviewer: 'That's why we are not adopting them. This would have been an act of self harm if we had gone ahead with it.' The comments raise questions about whether Brexit will deliver the promised economic benefits of independence from the bloc, and whether the government was edging towards a position where it would unilaterally accept EU controls.  Goods moving from the UK have been subject to checks in the EU since the Brexit withdrawal agreement was implemented on January 1, 2021.  Rees-Mogg said a 'new regime of border import controls' will be established by the end of 2023. The new border regime will apply equally to goods from the EU and from the rest of the world. The government has vowed to have 'the world's best border' following the decision to leave the EU's single market and customs union. Port operators expressed frustration that time and money spent preparing for the new checks has been 'wasted'. Tim Morris, chief executive of the UK Major Ports Group, which represents UK port operators, said: 'Many ports have been working incredibly hard and have invested over PS100 million of their own money to build a network of brand new border checks to meet the requirements the government has been insisting on for several years. 'This now looks like wasted time, effort and money to develop what we fear will be highly bespoke white elephants.' On whether the UK would adopt EU controls, the prime minister's official spokesman said: 'That is not the approach we are taking. We are using the flexibility that the UK government has to decide how and when to introduce this approach. 'We think there is more work to do on a new model that better utilises data and technology. We are still committed to introducing these checks.'", "54429d44c2f349b9cbb951f568518c8be8709e0d81bce693d3bfc43b": "Sharon Osbourne is to take a break from her new TalkTV show just three days after its launch, after husband Ozzy tested positive for Covid overnight.

Asked whether the MP will lose the Conservative whip if the allegations are proven, Johnson said: 'I think it's obviously unacceptable for anybody to be doing that kind of thing in the workplace. 'It would be the same for any kind of job up and down the country, let's be absolutely clear about that.'

Since the series' debut on the streaming service earlier this month, fans have celebrated the touching moment in which Nick comes out to his mother as bisexual.  However, Olivia was so moved by the scene as the pair prepared to film it that she cried, Kit told ITV's This Morning.  Speaking to hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield, he said: 'We normally before every scene read it through about 50%, you don't go 100% of the way. We were reading it through and suddenly Olivia just started crying.  'At first, I was thinking, 'God, she's just really good, I need to step it up my game massively here,' so I was really worried at that point. I think then other people told me afterwards that it was because it's such a beautifully written scene and a crucial part in so many people's lives. I think it really touched her.

Despite that controversy, prorogation is a routine process that signals the end of a parliamentary session and brings nearly all of its business to a close. Parliament is proroguing Thursday afternoon and MPs will return to their constituencies until the Queen's Speech on May 10. Here, HuffPost UK talks you through what it means, what MPs do during that period and remind you of what happened during Brexit.  What is the prorogation of parliament? Prorogation is the means by which a parliamentary 'session' is brought to an end. A session is a parliamentary year which normally starts in the Spring, with the state opening of parliament, and runs for around 12 months, ending with the prorogation of the session. There are normally five sessions in each parliament. How does it work? Prorogation is what is known as a 'prerogative power' exercised by the Crown on the advice of the Privy Council - an advisory body to the monarch. Essentially, the government of the day advises the Crown to prorogue and that request is acquiesced to. Why is prorogation needed? Prorogation is required to prepare for a Queen's Speech which is held on the day parliament reopens during a ceremony known as the state opening of parliament. The speech allows the government to outline its priorities for the upcoming year. A new parliamentary session can provide procedural opportunities to revisit matters where legislation was unable to progress in a previous session. What impact does it have? Prorogation brings to an end the proceedings in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Unless a specific provision is made - such as the standing orders to 'carry-over' bills - no business of a previous Parliamentary session may be carried over into the next session. Motions set down and orders made for business to be considered on future days all fall at prorogation, as do unanswered parliamentary questions. Select committee inquiries continue, though no committee may meet during prorogation. Statutory periods for consideration of secondary legislation are suspended over prorogation, but the legislation itself does not fall. What do MPs do during prorogation? While Parliament is prorogued, MPs and peers cannot formally debate government policy and legislation, submit questions, scrutinise through parliamentary committees or introduce legislation of their own. It means hundreds of MPs will return to their constituencies to focus on local issues. With the local elections just a week away, many MPs will be joining campaign teams on the doorstep. How long is parliament prorogued? Since the 1980s prorogation has rarely lasted more than two weeks. It has always led either to the dissolution of the current parliament - prior to a general election - or the start of a new parliamentary session. This year, the state opening of parliament will take place on Tuesday May 10 when MPs will return to the commons. What happens at the state opening? The state opening of parliament marks the formal start of the parliamentary year and the Queen's speech sets out the government's agenda for the coming session, outlining proposed policies and legislation. The speech is written by the government and is read out by the Queen from the throne in the House of Lords chamber. It is main ceremonial event in the parliamentary calendar and for over 500 years, has served as a symbolic reminder of the unity of parliament's three parts: the sovereign, the House of Lords and the House of Commons. The event is steeped in pomp and ceremony with a procession from Buckingham Palace to parliament.   The Queen will travel in the Irish state coach, an ornate four-horse-drawn carriage. A coach carrying the royal regalia - the Imperial State Crown, the Cap of Maintenance and Sword of State - precedes the monarch. The Queen will enter through the Sovereign's Entrance under the Victoria Tower, at the opposite end of the palace to Big Ben, and the royal standard replaces the union flag over Westminster until the Queen leaves the palace at the end of the ceremony. When inside, the sovereign dons the Imperial State Crown and ceremonial robes before making their way to the House of Lords. More recently the Queen has not worn the gown or the crown on account of how heavy they are.   What happened during Brexit? At the height of the Brexit crisis in August 2019, just before MPs returned from their summer recess, Boris Johnson asked the Queen to shut Parliament for five weeks, between September 9 until October 14.   Critics said it was an attempt to suppress MPs' opportunities to block a no-deal Brexit because they would have been stopped from sitting for 24 working days.     The government claimed it had nothing to do with Brexit and argued prorogation was a 'proceeding in Parliament' to allow the prime minister to outline plans for domestic policies, such as NHS funding.   However, on September 24, the Supreme Court ruled the prorogation unlawful. The court's president, Lady Hale, said the suspension 'had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification'. Following the ruling, parliament reopened the next day. Johnson also personally apologised for embarrassing the Queen, according to reports.

He 'strongly rejects all allegations of wrongdoing' and stepped down from his Capital Xtra 'until further notice' on Wednesday. Here's everything you need to know. Where did the allegations come from? According to a joint investigation from the BBC and the Guardian, Westwood has been accused of misusing his powerful position. All of the allegations published in the investigation this week have come from Black women in the music industry. Three women accused Westwood of opportunistic and predatory sexual behaviour while an additional four alleged he groped them at events when they were in their late teens or early 20s. All of the incidents reportedly took place between 1992 and 2017. Two of the women claim he initiated unwanted and unexpected sex, while another said she was subjected to unwanted oral sex and four others accused him of touching their bodies inappropriately as they posed for photos with him. The accusers do not know each other. According to the BBC, 'some work in the music industry and fear repercussions'. One woman told the broadcaster: 'I would describe it as an abuse of power because...who they're going to believe? This little girl from the Midlands, or this big shiny star from London? He's on national radio, international.' The seven women, who all claim to have met Westwood through his work, have chosen to remain anonymous. Their allegations were unpacked in a BBC Three documentary, Tim Westwood: Abuse of Power, which aired on Tuesday at 9pm. None of the women who spoke to the BBC have reported the incidents to the police. They said they were coming forward to make sure Westwood is 'held accountable' for his behaviour and to encourage others to come forward. Who is Westwood? Westwood, 64, began his career in hip hop on local radio, before moving to Capital Radio in London. He then secured his own show on BBC Radio 1 in 1994 where he hosted the first nationally-broadcast rap programme. He has since become an influential figure in the hip-hop world. He left the BBC in 2013, and returned to Capital where, up until Wednesday, he was presenting regular Capital Xtra shows on Saturday nights. How has Westwood responded? A representative for the DJ told PA news agency: 'Tim Westwood strongly denies all allegations of inappropriate behaviour. 'In a career that has spanned 40 years, there have never been any complaints made against him officially or unofficially. 'Tim Westwood strongly rejects all allegations of wrongdoing.' Three of his planned DJ sets have since been cancelled and the events page of his website, which had more UK events planned for the next month, has been taken down. What's the history behind these claims? Aside from Westwood's status in the music industry, this case has caused a particular stir because this is not the first time concerns about the DJ have been raised. HuffPost UK had an exclusive in July 2020 about the pressure Global Media - the parent company of Capital - was facing to launch an investigation into Westwood's conduct at the time. Global was heavily criticised (including by its own staff) for not addressing the claims publicly and for keeping Westwood's show running when allegations of sexual misconduct against Westwood first emerged. Back in 2020, a source told HuffPost UK: 'Many presenters across the brands are uncomfortable with the situation and the executives have personally told staff not to speak to the media, which is unprecedented.' The exclusive followed an online hashtag which emerged that June called #SurvivingTimWestwood, as word of the claims against the DJ spread. The allegations also led to a change.org petition calling for the mayor of London and the Met Police to launch an investigation into Westwood's alleged behaviour towards Black female students. It accumulated more than 6,000 signatures. However, the Met was not able to explain whether it had launched a probe into the DJ. Westwood strongly denied the allegations at the time. He told HuffPost UK: 'I can categorically say that I have never had an inappropriate relationship with anyone under the age of 18. I am aware of attempts by anonymous sources to make fabricated allegations online. I can confirm that such allegations are false and without any foundation.' A representation for Westwood told HuffPost UK that no complaints against him had been received at Capital Xtra, although an anonymous producer from Global alleged in 2020 that staff were 'outraged' at the company's 'silence'. Several Black British public figures contributed to the conversation around Westwood then as well, such as presenter Grace Victory and DJ Funk Butcher. Westwood's peer in the hip hop industry, the late rapper Ty Chijioke, also previously referred to the veteran DJ as a vulture in reference to his behaviour with young fans.  Speaking to the BBC during the 2022 investigation, one of the women accusing Westwood said: 'Finally people's allegations are starting to be taken seriously.' What has the BBC and Capital said? BBC director general Tim Davie said he had not found any evidence of complaints made about Westwood when he was working there. He said: 'I've asked and we've looked at our records and we've seen no evidence. 'If something like this were raised or anything comes up, we investigate it fully. And I would hope we were doing that in that time as well.  'I would simply say if people have evidence where things weren't followed up, or they have concerns in this area, bring it to us. We want to investigate it.' He said the testimonies were 'shocking' and encouraged people to bring forward 'evidence of wrong doing', because 'there's nothing worse in life than abuse of power'. He added: 'You need to be absolutely clear that it's completely unacceptable.' A spokesperson from Capital's parent company Global confirmed on Wednesday that 'following the claims that have recently come to light, Tim Westwood has stepped down from his show until further notice.'

But he at least has confirmation that Guardians Of The Galaxy director James Gunn has his back, with the filmmaker coming to the actor's defence on Twitter Monday amid calls to axe him from future Marvel films. Responding to a viral tweet calling for Marvel to replace the actor with Patrick Wilson, Gunn said he would 'never' oust Pratt, who is set to reunite with the director in a third Guardians film next year.  'For what? Because of your made-up, utterly-false beliefs about him? For something that someone else told you about him that's not true?' Gunn wrote. 'Chris Pratt would never be replaced as Star-Lord but, if he ever was, we would all be going with him.'  Pratt has fielded plenty of backlash in recent years over his rumored political affiliation -- he sparked controversy ahead of the 2020 presidential election for mocking the importance of voting. However, the actor has largely stayed out of the political fray, having previously said that he doesn't feel represented by Democrats or Republicans.   He's also come under fire for his past connections to churches that have a history of discriminating against the LGBTQ community.   Back in 2019, Elliot Page publicly called Pratt out for attending an 'infamously' anti-LGBTQ church, which prompted Pratt to make a rare statement about his beliefs. 'It has recently been suggested that I belong to a church which 'hates a certain group of people' and is 'infamously anti-LGBTQ,'' Pratt posted on social media at the time. 'Nothing could be further from the truth. I go to a church that opens their doors to absolutely everyone.' Responding in a follow-up tweet on Monday, Gunn seemed to echo that same sentiment.  'I know the church he currently goes to,' the director wrote. 'Do you? (The answer is you don't, but you heard from someone who heard from someone who heard from someone where he goes to church, so decided, 'yeah, okay, I'll believe this terrible thing I heard online about this celebrity!').'  The people in Pratt's orbit have made a habit out of defending him in recent years. The actor's wife, Katherine Schwarzenegger, previously called out the 'meanness and bullying' of an Instagram post that ranked Pratt as the least popular Hollywood Chris -- a common internet competition that pits Chris Hemsworth, Chris Pine and Chris Evans and Pratt against each other. A handful of Marvel stars, including Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo, Zoe Saldana and Jeremy Renner also voiced their support for Pratt in strongly worded public statements. With Gunn, Pratt has at least returned the favour after the director was booted from the Guardians franchise over past offensive tweets that were resurfaced by far-right figures in retaliation for his opposition to Donald Trump. The actor along with the rest of the Guardians cast pleaded for Gunn to be reinstated as director for the upcoming third entry in the franchise at the time in an open letter. Marvel has since given Gunn a second chance, as he's set to direct Guardians of the Galaxy 3 along with a holiday special about the ragtag group of heroes set to be released in the coming years. Pratt, meanwhile, will next appear as Star-Lord in the studio's upcoming Thor: Love and Thunder, which will hit theatres in July.", "74120487f2317d176fb914215e8e9c8e1eaa1337db94ce022eb35868": "A new Samsung campaign has caused a stir on Twitter - but for all the wrong reasons. Showcasing its new smart watch, the advert shows a woman waking up at 2am and then going for a run through deserted, poorly-lit streets while wearing headphones. The voiceover says: ''Sleep at night. Run faster, push harder, follow the herd' - not for me. I run on a different schedule - mine. 'Your Galaxy. Your Way.' The runner can be seen interacting with various people during her outing including a cyclist, a person at a bus stop, someone on the side of road and a group who seem to have been for a night out. All of these encounters appear to be very friendly, which has certainly surprised people on Twitter. But the ad has also been accused of being particularly tone deaf as it comes after a year of heightened conversation about women's safety. Ashling Murphy was killed in January this year while out jogging in Ireland at 4pm, prompting another wave of public outrage over the dangers women face when out in public. Reclaim These Streets, a women's safety group, described it as 'totally tone deaf' in light of Murphy's death. Her murder also sparked the hashtag #shewasonarun, where people started sharing their own experiences of being harassed while jogging. Esther Newman, from Women's Running magazine, said the advert is 'not representing the truth'. She told Radio 1 Newsbeat: 'It's really shocking. I don't know any woman who would be running at 2am in the morning. Certainly not in a city.' She added: 'Wearing headphones is a contentious point. Most women runners I know don't wear headphones and that's during the day, because they are concerned about their safety.' Newman said her contributors believe 'it's a very very small' portion of men who make women feel unsafe, but encouraged advertisers to focus on how men can make women feel more comfortable while running. The online running community Run Mummy Run also told the BBC that the portrayal of women running at night was 'unrealistic' as they do not have 'the luxury of this type of freedom with [their] safety' in reality. It's not just the running aspect of this campaign which misses the mark - women's safety in general has become one of the most pressing issues of the last year. ONS stats revealed one in two women compared to one in seven men feel unsafe when walking alone after dark in a quiet street near their home. Only in September 2021, Sabina Nessa was attacked and killed while walking through a southeast London park. The campaign also launched just 13 months after the death of Sarah Everard, who was kidnapped, raped and killed by a then-serving police officer. She was walking home through Clapham at around 9pm at the time. These high-profile cases - particularly Everard's - pushed women's safety to the top of the news agenda. The Metropolitan Police's subsequent attempts to show it is enforcing this have missed the mark significantly - only in January, officers tried to reduce spiking by randomly drug testing women. People on Twitter this week have suggested that the ad is so out of touch it must have been produced with hardly any women. Many more openly explained their own personal angst over seeing the ad.", "80540a47e6d0154ffba418213c8b63971c59c5bce574c5d0dadd42a9": "Mother-in-laws are often the victims of 'cliches', according to the Pope. And I'm inclined to agree. Addressing crowds in St Peter's Square at the Vatican on Wednesday, the head of the Catholic church urged listeners to be kinder to the matriarchs of their families. 'I'm not saying we see her as the devil, but she is always presented in a pejorative way,' he said. 'But the mother-in-law is the mother of your husband and the mother of your wife.' Perhaps I'm biased, because my own mother-in-law in a gem, but I've always found the bitter, interfering mother-in-law trope absurd. It's drenched in misogyny - much like the cliche of the evil step mother - and perpetuates the idea that women can only co-exist in a state of conflict or competition. 'Controlling', 'judgmental', 'critical' and 'overbearing' are all words that have been used to describe mother-in-laws. The phrase 'monster-in-law' is often thrown around on parenting forums. And one article goes as far as to call them 'a soul-sucking parasite that feeds on your misery.' God forbid an older woman should ever express her opinion...  Sure, some mother-in-law relationships are tricker than others, but it doesn't help women one bit if we expect women after a certain age to become silent wallflowers. Let her share her thoughts - it doesn't mean you always have to agree with them.  Of course, the culture of kindness needs to go both ways. And the Pope also had advice for mothers-in-laws. 'I tell you, be careful how you express yourselves,' he said. But one part of his speech may make you eye-roll, just a little.  'We say to ourselves 'the further away your mother-in-law is, the better'. But no - she's a mother, she's an elderly person,' he said. 'One of the most beautiful things for a woman is to have grandchildren. When her children have children, it brings her to life again.' I'd argue the most beautiful thing for a woman is to make her own choice about whether she wants children or not - and no mother-in-law should base her happiness on the possibility of grandchildren, something that is (and should always be) outside her control. But baby steps and all. He's almost got it right. This stereotype is centuries old, after all. And if we don't start to course correct the internalised trope now, it'll only come back to haunt us if we ever become mother-in-laws ourselves.

The Independent Expert Panel (IEP) launched an investigation after a former member of Byrne's constituency staff made a complaint under parliament's Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS). The commissioner for standards, Kathryn Stone, found that Byrne, a former Cabinet minister, had 'ostracised the complainant' between March and July 2020 following a dispute that resulted in him sending the staff member home. The IEP found that the MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill had stopped all personal contact with the staff member for several months and denied him access to his Parliamentary IT account. Stone concluded that Byrne's behaviour 'was malicious behaviour that involved a significant misuse of power' especially given the staff member's ill health and the contest of the first coronavirus lockdown.  Byrne, who did not appeal the decision, said that he was 'profoundly sorry' about the incident and that he had 'apologised in full to the individual concerned'. Giving its verdict, the IEP said: 'This case involves a serious breach of the bullying and harassment policy which arose from the respondent abusing his position of power and ostracising the complainant, who was his employee, by ceasing personal contact with him for several months and denying him access to his parliamentary IT account. 'The impact of this behaviour was compounded by the fact that it occurred during the first period of lockdown when the complainant was physically separated from work colleagues, uncertain of his future work status and had undergone a period of ill health. 'The respondent's decision not to engage with the complainant following what he perceived to be acts of misconduct was not, as he argued, a reasonable HR strategy. It was bullying. 'He should, as he now accepts, have tackled any alleged misconduct through a proper disciplinary process not by ostracising the complainant.' As well as recommending a two-day Commons suspension, the panel also said Byrne must make a written apology to the staff member and take part in management training. GMB, the union which represented Byrne's former staff member, said the sanction was 'far beneath what is needed to address the abuse'. Chair of the GMB branch for members' staff Jenny Symmons said: 'GMB welcomes the decision to uphold our member's complaint of serious bullying and harassment.  'However, the sanction of an apology, a recommendation for training and a suspension of just two days is far beneath what is needed to address this kind of abuse.  'MPs have a duty of care for their staff which we see violated time and time again.  'It's time we removed the responsibility of employment from MPs for good and give staff the safety and security at work they deserve.'  In a statement following the ruling, Byrne said he was 'extremely grateful to the parliamentary commissioner for standards and to the Independent Expert Panel for their thorough investigation and careful judgement'. He admitted that 'did not resolve the dispute correctly with a proper disciplinary process' and 'failed to fulfill my obligations as an employer and parliament's behaviour code'. 'This constituted an ostracism which was a breach of parliament's behaviour code which I strongly support, and caused distress for which I am profoundly sorry. 'I have apologised in full to the individual concerned.' He added: 'I'm incredibly grateful to the panel for recognising the genuine remorse I felt about the impact on the individual concerned, the steps I have already taken to ensure this never happens again along with the work still to do, and for concluding that I did not deliberately act to delay the investigation. 'This has been a valuable lesson for me and one I am determined to learn as me and my team seek to offer the best possible service and voice for the residents of Hodge Hill.'

The 51-year-old Countryfile presenter revealed she had breast cancer in September last year and that she would be undergoing a mastectomy in order to remove a six centimetre tumour. During her appearance on the ITV show to chat about about her new documentary Julia Bradbury: Breast Cancer And Me, Julia and host Holly Willoughby were both in tears at one point as she recalled the moment she had to tell her two young children about her illness.  'Telling your children you have cancer is the hardest thing you'll ever have to do in your life,' Julia said. 'You also don't know how much you tell them to be realistic, and how much do you need to protect them.. It's a very tricky balance. I don't think any parent really knows what to do.' She added, 'One of my children said, 'Can I still hug you?' and the other said, 'Is it contagious?' I never thought about either of those two things. You just don't know what's going through their mind.  'You do your best, but it's a very difficult thing to navigate.'  The presenter and broadcaster also opened up about having a mastectomy, revealing it was a cathartic experience to say 'goodbye' to her breast. 'First of all, I was calling them 'masectomies' instead of mastectomies... you just don't understand what a mastectomy is - it's the amputation of your breast.  'There are so many different versions of that, so some women can have reconstructions, some women can't have reconstructions, some women like me can have immediate reconstruction because of the type of cancer I had.'  She added: 'I have a silicone implant. The surgeon was able to save my own skin and nipple, which I'm very grateful for.... I said goodbye to my breast... my friend said the best advice she got from a doctor was to say goodbye to your breast. It was really helpful and cathartic.

Partridge is known for his lack of tact and social awkwardness, with Richard long being famed for his 'Accidental Partridge' moments.  And in an interview with BBC Breakfast on Thursday, Steve also said he reckoned another former Good Morning Britain presenter bared a likeness to Partridge.  'I suppose if you fused Richard Madeley with Piers Morgan, you might get close to who Partridge is at the moment,' he told hosts Naga Munchetty and Charlie Stayt.  'I think Alan likes to think of himself as cutting edge and edgy and relevant.' Steve also revealed that many presenters now help inspire what his character gets up to.  'Almost every presenter has had a Partridge moment, and I sort of galvanise that and chuck it into a bucket marked 'Partridge' and regurgitate it,' he said.  Charlie noted how being compared to Alan Partridge had become 'a badge of honour', Steve said: 'He started out as a buffoon and now there's sort of a bit of affection for him. So although he's misguided and ill-informed, he's not nasty and he's not wicked. He tries to do the right thing. 'When people laugh at Partridge, I think people see a slightly inept uncle or their parents' generation getting things slightly wrong.' Last year, Richard finally revealed what he makes of the constant Partridge comparisons.  In an interview with the Daily Mail, he said he thinks it is 'actually quite funny', but does sometimes think the things he says or does are 'unfairly' taken out of context. 'I honestly don't care at all - it's actually quite funny. It's part and parcel of the job I do,' he said. 'It's so important that you don't take yourself seriously, because you're not gonna have a good time if you do. 'Judy and I started out on This Morning which isn't really hard news. I don't go to war zones, I do popular television, which on the whole is pretty pointless, it's just entertainment. It doesn't mean you're remotely important or interesting.' The I'm A Celebrity...

Just the idea of wrestling a duvet into a new cover can be enough to make you feel tired. So much so, that men in particular aren't washing them. Half of single men don't wash their bed sheets for up to four months at a time, according to a new survey. And 12% of them admitted to only washing them when they remember.  Pizuna Linens conducted a survey of of 2,250 UK adults over the age of 18 and found that 62% of single women changed their bedding once every two weeks whilst only 29% single men washed their sheets at the same rate. Almost half (45%) of single men said they only washed their sheets every three to four months.  But what happens when you don't change them? Not washing your bed sheets frequently can lead to a host of health problems such as infected wounds and athletes foot, according to Mary Malone, a laundry expert at about.com. According to Malone, during sleep we continue to perspire, meaning body oils and soil are released.  'Infrequent cleaning of sheets and pillowcases allows the fluids to seep into the pillows and mattresses, and those are much more difficult to clean than tossing sheets in the washer,' she told ATTN. Allowing dust, sweat and dirt to build-up for just two weeks can be enough to leave you with a scratchy throat or the sniffles, according to New York University microbiologist Philip Tierno  Leaving your bedsheets unchanged can result in sweat and dirt seeping into your pillows and mattress. So how often should we be changing our sheets? The general consensus is that we should all be changing our sheets - including duvet covers and pillow cases - once a week, Tierno says.  We should be giving our duvet a six-monthly clean or - at the very least - washing it once a year, according to The Fine Bedding Company. Bacteria and bodily fluids can build up in duvets over a short period of time, the company argues, with duvet covers and pyjamas merely acting as a 'first line of defence' against sweat. How you wash your duvet will depend on the type of duvet you have and how big your washing machine is.  Check for care instructions on your duvet first and follow the guidelines. But in general, natural-filled duvets (think: feathers and down) should not be washed and dried at home, regardless of the capacity or capability of your machine. When it comes to synthetic duvets, these are usually fine to wash at home. For larger or higher tog duvets - ie your winter ones - it's usually recommended that they are washed in a large capacity machine.

The prime minister made the erroneous statement during prime minister's questions. He said there were '500,000 more people in paid employment now than there were before the pandemic began'. But according to the Office for National Statistics, there are actually around 500,000 fewer people employed in the UK now than there were pre-Covid.  Between January and March 2020, just as the pandemic began, the ONS said there were 33,012,000 aged 16 and over in employment.   However, between December 2021 and February this year - the most recent period for which figures are available - that number had actually fallen to 32,485,000. The Liberal Democrats have now written to the UK Statistics Authority - which has previously rebuked the PM for making the same misleading claim - urging them to investigate. Christine Jardine, the party's Treasury spokesperson, said: 'By repeating his debunked claim about employment levels, the Prime Minister has onceagain shown he has no respect for the truth. 'Whilst families across the UK are struggling to cope with soaring energy bills and rising prices, Boris Johnson is continuing to misrepresent reality in a desperate attempt to score a good headline. 'The prime minister has brazenly misled parliament yet again and cannot go on. 'He must immediately retract these false claims and be honest with the public - for once in his career.'  The UK Statistics Authority has previously berated the prime minister for wrongly claiming employment levels are higher now than before Covid.    While the number of people on payrolls is higher than before the pandemic, this is more than offset by the number of self-employed people who are no longer working. In a letter to the PM, UK Statistics Authority chair Sir David Norgrove said: 'If, as seems to be the case, your statement referred only to the increase in the number of people on payrolls, it would be a selective use of data that is likely to give a misleading impression of trends in the labour market unless that distinction is carefully explained.'

Nicky Morgan, a former education secretary and women and equalities minister who now sits in the Lords, said she was 'shocked' when she first heard the allegation -- calling it a 'bit of a jaw dropper'. Baroness Morgan said it was not only just an 'extraordinary thing to do' but that there was an 'element of almost aggression about about it as well'. The incident was first revealed at a meeting of Tory MPs on Tuesday night where some female members expressed their concerns about alleged sexual harassment and misconduct in Westminster. On Wednesday night, a Conservative Party spokesperson said the matter was being referred to the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS). 'Upon the conclusion of any ICGS investigation the chief whip will take appropriate action,' the spokesperson said. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Morgan said that while there was a 'process to go through' regarding the accused, if the allegation was proven they should be expelled from the party as a 'minimum'. Her views were echoed by defence secretary Ben Wallace, who suggested that the MP in question could 'lose the whip... so they could no longer belong to the Conservative Party' 'That usually means they can't be reselected as an MP,' he told the programme. 'If they're a government minister they could lose their job. It would be for the House authorities to define what is an appropriate level of punishment for that type of behaviour.' Morgan also hit out at the 'male culture' that presides in parliament, saying sexism and misogyny was 'not just an issue on Conservative benches' but 'across the House'. She said the fact there were no employment contracts in place gave some MPs a 'feeling of invincibility -- that actually, ultimately it doesn't matter...nobody's actually going to take their job away from them, the job that gives them this sort of status to feel they can do these sorts of things'. Rachel Maclean, the Home Office minister responsible for safeguarding women, also called for the MP to lose their job. Ms Maclean, who was at the meeting on Tuesday where the allegations surfaced, said everyone present had been 'shocked and horrified'. 'It's just gruesome,' she told Sky News's The Take With Sophy Ridge. 'I'm the minister responsible for safeguarding women and for creating laws which protect women against sexual harassment and violence against women and girls, so it is deeply sickening and disgusting to hear that a male MP is watching porn. 'Action needs to be taken and I very much hope... we will see him out of Parliament, out of the party. I hope that's where we get to.' The latest allegation has rocked a Conservative Party that is already under heavy fire following a sexism row over an article about Labour's Angela Rayner in the Mail on Sunday. The newspaper carried quotes from an unnamed Tory MP suggesting the deputy leader deliberately crosses and uncrosses her legs to distract Boris Johnson during prime minister's questions. At the same time, the Sunday Times also revealed that 56 MPs -- including three Cabinet ministers and two Shadow Cabinet ministers -- were being investigated for sexual misconduct. On Thursday the BBC reported that that a female Welsh MP had been described by a Shadow Cabinet member as a 'secret weapon' because 'women want to be her friend and men want to sleep with her'.

Vampire devices are electronics that drain a large amount of power even when they're on standby, costing you money.  Households are spending PS2.2bn annually by leaving vampire devices on standby, British Gas research found. This equates to PS147 a year for the average UK household, which is the same as two month's electricity charges.  Most British households will now pay PS1,971 for gas and electricity as energy prices have risen by 54%. Energy UK deputy director Dhara Vyas told BBC News that more bills could be set to rise.  She said: 'We're seeing really high price rises at the minute. We don't know yet for sure, because global gas prices continue to be volatile. Some estimates do say that we're looking at bills of up to PS3,000 this winter.' Since 2009, legislation has required devices to switch into a low power mode (such as standby) after a reasonable amount of time. And since 2013, they must not consume more than 0.5 Watts in standby or in off mode. However, the latest research suggests the small amount of energy appliances do use on standby can still add up (and the total will be greater if you have old appliances in your home).  According to the British Gas research, some devices only need to be plugged in a wall for them to be draining power. Smart speakers, laptops and internet routers all cost to keep plugged in. It costs PS24.61 per year to keep your television on standby, the research found. With an additional PS23.10 for a set-top box, from TV providers like Sky or Virgin Media. Leaving a games console on standby can work out an average of PS12.17, whilst computers could cost around PS11.22 Other devices include:  Microwave: PS16.37 Shower: PS9.80 Washing machine: PS4.73 Printer: PS3.81 Phone charger: PS1.26  'There are smart plugs you can buy which will let you check everything is turned off from your phone,' British Gas energy expert Marc Robson says. 'At night, or when not in use, try switching off devices at the mains rather than switching to standby, as even the standby light on a television uses energy. Try not to overcharge your mobile phone and laptop unnecessarily. 'As soon as your device is charged, try and get into the habit of unplugging it.'", "3bda02a065efb03fd6935762b7d7779f3677a918edcc637dd751b312": "If you're anything like us, you're still reeling from the heartbreaking events depicted in Russell T Davies' It's A Sin, even a year after the show ended. Well, while the writer has ruled out the idea of penning a second series of the Channel 4 drama, it's been revealed that he did have a spark of an idea for a separate show featuring some of the characters. Speaking at a Bafta TV session, producer Nicola Shindler outlined Russell's idea, explaining (via Metro): 'There was a time when there were a lot of stories in the press about young boys being manipulated online to masturbate. They were being filmed and then they were being blackmailed, essentially. 'It was young teenage boys and it was something that Russell was really concerned about.' She continued: 'It sounds like it's not related at all, except that he thought: 'What if you cut to the present day, and what if Jill and Roscoe are going out there, trying to stop the people who are doing this?'' Admitting she may have revealed too much, Nicola added: 'He just wanted to pick up on that idea that one problem might have gone away, but there are still so many vulnerable people out there who need looking after, or who need some kind of attention shining on them. 'He never wrote any of it - it was a small idea. I don't know if he'll be cross that I've told people what the idea is. He just wanted to pick it up in the present day and say, 'Look, there are still so many people out there who need some kind of protection'. That was the point of it.' It's been well-documented that It's A Sin was originally supposed to have run for eight episodes, though this was eventually cut down to five. Among the scenes that ended up being axed included an epilogue that would have been set in the present day, featuring characters like Jill and Roscoe.", "d4318adad669cde789782a1afd7b49aa1a2f2ca5246c69c18bb67d4e": "Andrew Garfield has announced plans to take a hiatus from acting after the release of his next film. The British star has had a busy couple of years, landing an Oscar nomination for his leading role in the musical Tick, Tick... Boom! and appearing in the biopic The Eyes Of Tammy Faye, which earned Jessica Chastain her first Academy Award win last month. He also reprised the role of Spider-Man for a cameo in the Marvel film No Way Home last year, and is gearing up for the release of his new series Under The Banner Of Heaven. However, now he's nearing the end of a jam-packed run of acting roles, Andrew has shared his intention to put his feet up and take it easy for a bit. 'I'm going to rest for a little bit,' he told Variety when asked what's next for him. 'I need to recalibrate and reconsider what I want to do next and who I want to be and just be a bit of a person for a while.' Noting that awards season can be 'a washing machine', he added: 'I need to just be a bit ordinary for a while.' Sadly, that probably means we won't be seeing Andrew on Strictly in the autumn, despite his recent admission that he's dying to take part. Unless he's throwing us off the scent, of course. Under The Banner Of Heaven unites the former Spider-Man star with Normal People actor Daisy Edgar-Jones. The true crime drama centres around a police officer who is disturbed when he looks into the murder of a mother and her baby daughter and finds links to the Mormon Church. Based on a non-fiction book by Jon Krakauer, it was adapted for the big screen by Oscar winner Dustin Lance Black, whose previous work includes Milk and When We Rise.", "1192a903f088f5793df1a638c041633ba85a83401ebb147081fa14ec": "Russia is like a 'cancerous growth' in Ukraine that must be removed, Ben Wallace has said. The defence secretary said Britain would do all it could to 'get the limpet off the rock' and ensure Vladimir Putin does not retain any territory in the country. His comments came after foreign secretary Liz Truss said that Russian forces must be pushed out of 'the whole of Ukraine'. Appearing on Sky News, Wallace said Russian president Vladimir Putin had failed in his mission to occupy the whole of Ukraine, so was now trying to retain the territory he has held since 2014, when Moscow annexed Crimea. He said: 'I think it's certainly the case that Putin, having failed in nearly all its objectives may seek to consolidate what he's got, sort of fortify and dig in, as he did in 2014, and just be a sort of cancerous growth within the country of Ukraine and make it very hard for people to move them out of those fortified positions. 'So I think it's really about if we want this to not happen, we have to help Ukrainians effectively get the limpet off the rock and keep the momentum pushing them back.' He added: 'The international community believes Russia should leave Ukraine, the international community has condemned Russia for its invasion of Crimea, which was illegal in 2014. 'We've constantly said that Russia should leave Ukraine sovereign territory so that hasn't changed.' The defence secretary said there was 'a long way to go before Ukraine pushes into Crimea', but that the UK would back them if they chose to do so. 'I think what I would certainly say is, we are supporting Ukraine's sovereign integrity,' he said. 'We've done that all along. That of course includes Crimea. 'But you know, first and foremost, let's get Russia out of where they are now in its invasion plans and help Ukraine resolve and actually remember the Minsk agreement, which Russia has basically ripped up, was all about trying to resolve those two occupied territories. 'But the key thing is to continue to support Ukraine's sovereign integrity and their ability to defend themselves'.", "4dff3697057e7dea2cc715f7e7d8822667228343ec80ae52a02a50c8": "In today's edition of you-couldn't-make-it-up news, Jim Carrey has responded to a ludicrous claim that his latest role is playing US President Joe Biden.  Not in a film role, the actual Joe Biden In a recent video shared on Twitter, one Donald Trump supporter shared her belief that the US president is, in fact, dead and multiple actors have been standing in for him. After seeing the video featuring Jason Selvig of The Good Liars (a comedy duo that interviews conservative Americans about political matters), the actor - who starred in The Mask - was (almost) all of us in his response. 'Oh dear,' he wrote. The video shows Selvig talking with an American woman who says: 'The guy that's doing the stand-up job of trying to wake people up, is an actor wearing a mask.' 'I mean, there are several different people playing Joe Biden at this point,' she continued. Referring to the moment when Biden fell up the stairs of Air Force One in 2021, she added: 'I myself think that that was Jim Carrey.' She then explained that she believed the actor was 'being silly by falling up the stairs three different times'. 'And James Woods is also I think one of the doppleganger mask-wearing people,' she added. In response to Jim's tweet, The Good Liars wrote: 'Be honest, was the woman we interviewed in this clip just you in a mask?'", "75e41d43150589d29aab8c4a7ca8a7a9e4b8d8b9153cfb9e8ca57b78": "The city of York sent a strong message to Prince Andrew on Wednesday that they don't want him as their Duke anymore. Council members voted to remove his Freedom of the City status, an honour he was given in 1986 when he married Sarah Ferguson. Some additionally called on the prince to relinquish his Duke of York title in the aftermath of his now-settled sexual assault civil case with Virginia Giuffre. The decision to strip Andrew of the status was unanimous, according to Darryl Smalley, the City of York Council's executive member for culture, leisure and communities. 'I was pleased to see councillors of all parties support this motion and make it clear that it is no longer appropriate for Prince Andrew to represent York and its residents,' Smalley said. 'The removal of this honorary title sends the right message that we as a city stand with victims of abuse.' But that's not the end of it. Smalley also thinks the prince should 'do the right thing and relinquish his Duke of York title.' Smalley added: 'If he fails to do so, the Government and Buckingham Palace must step in to remove his title to finally end Prince Andrew's connection to York.' Neither Buckingham Palace nor Andrew have commented on the city's decision. Still, it's just the latest disgrace to befall the prince since the settlement was announced in February. In addition, he has been officially stripped of his military affiliations and royal patronages and gave up his honorary membership of the Royal & Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews, one of the world's most prestigious golf clubs. The prince settled his case with Giuffre in February. She claimed disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein had trafficked her to have sex with Andrew when she was 17, according to the Guardian. The prince has long denied Giuffre's allegations and made no admission of guilt in the settlement, which has been estimated to be more than $10 million (PS7.97 million).", "bbb237815e85af58901ff11c0f592db70164479c43a2d21e3de1e84c": "Olivia Wilde's presentation at CinemaCon on Tuesday night turned out to be a family affair -- but not in a good way. The director and actor was onstage at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas discussing Don't Worry Darling, her upcoming thriller starring Harry Styles and Florence Pugh, when an unidentified person came up front, placed a manila envelope on the stage and slid it toward her, according to The Hollywood Reporter. As she picked up the envelope, Wilde asked, 'Is this for me?' Turns out it was. Deadline is reporting that the mystery envelope, which was marked 'personal and confidential,' held custody papers from actor Jason Sudeikis, Wilde's ex-boyfriend and the father of her two children.  Despite the awkward situation, witnesses said Wilde handled the situation like a pro and continued to talk up her film to the audience, which was mostly theatre exhibitors. It is unknown how the person serving the papers got into the event, but CinemaCon official Mitch Neuhauser told Variety that security protocols are going to be reevaluated in light of the incident. An unnamed representative of Sudeikis told HuffPost that the papers were drawn up to 'establish jurisdiction relating to the children of Ms. Wilde and Mr. Sudeikis,' but said the actor had nothing to do with how and when the papers were served. ''Mr. Sudeikis had no prior knowledge of the time or place that the envelope would have been delivered as this would solely be up to the process service company involved and he would never condone her being served in such an inappropriate manner,' the representative said in a statement Wednesday.  Wilde and Sudeikis were together for nine years before splitting at the beginning of 2020. They share two children: son Otis, 6, and daughter Daisy, 4. Sudeikis told GQ last July that figuring out exactly what went wrong in the relationship was going to take him a while.   'I'll have a better understanding of why in a year,' Sudeikis said. 'And an even better one in two, and an even greater one in five, and it'll go from being, you know, a book of my life to becoming a chapter to a paragraph to a line to a word to a doodle.'

There's a reason why the friend to lover trope is so popular in film and TV. You're friends with someone for years, you date other people and then you realise the person you've been looking for has been right in front of you.  Having a solid friendship with someone can be a great foundation for a relationship. But the movies we watch don't tell us how awkward it can be to tell your friend you fancy them. What if they aren't attracted to us? What if it ruins the friendship? This is what this week's reader, Carol, is worried about. 'There's a man that I like and we have been friends for about five years. We are in the same running and wild swimming group and get on well. How can I move out of the 'friend zone'?' she asked.  Though the term 'friend zone' has been debated, there's nothing wrong with exploring the potential of a relationship with a friend - as long as you're fully prepared to accept that they may not reciprocate your feelings.  Though it can be scary to shift the dynamic, Counselling Directory member Simona Bajenaru says we should be honest and authentic. 'Speaking your feelings might be as rewarding as perhaps the hesitation to do so. Whether reciprocated or not, once the initial fear and shame subside, your sense of confidence and pride might blossom,' Bajenaru says. How can we get out of the friend zone?  Bajenaru first invites anyone in this situation to ask yourself five questions:    Why now?    What drives your desire to move out of the 'friend zone'?    What are your expectations, moving out of it?    Would you say he completes or complements you where you are at now?    What feelings come up when you envisage your future together?   Bajenaru emphasis that 'although answering these questions logically is important, digging deeper into your feelings will help clarify whether your desire to advance this relationship is genuine or acting on a temporary need to be fulfilled (company, intimacy) or fear to be satisfied (loneliness, low self-esteem).' In a situation like Carol's - where you usually see the other person in an activity group - asking them if they'd like to meet up one on one for a coffee or drink is probably a good first step.  Why do people struggle to move from friendship to romantic?  'Coming out of the 'friend zone' is terribly scary for most of us,' Bajenaru says. 'Hesitation is a natural reaction to such prospects since a non-reciprocation of your feelings blurs your treasured friendship's way forward. 'Best case scenario, his feelings are mutual and knowing each other well enough provides a beautiful and safe space to nurture the next stage of your relationship. 'The less fortunate scenario may be a slow distancing leading to potentially losing a valued friend, a perhaps abrupt end to his reliable, consistent presence in your life. Should this be the case, please know you have not done anything wrong.' How can we continue a friendship with someone if they don't reciprocate feelings for us? There is an overall risk of awkwardness between yourselves for a while after feelings are shared. 'Sometimes the response is not even immediate: your friend may choose to process his own feelings first. A beautiful placeholder to receive might be 'I am flattered, I need to process it,' Bajenaru says. 'However, they may choose to never respond nor engage, avoiding difficult conversations with you and themselves. Bajenaru adds that 'continuing the friendship would require an honest conversation about the attempt to have more than a friendship and setting some boundaries and perhaps 'ground rules' until some new kind of 'normality' is established.'

But for all the products we accumulate on our bathroom shelves, we often don't understand the best way to apply all this stuff. When are fingers OK? When do you need a sponge or brush? And, with so many expensive makeup tool options out there, which ones are worth an investment? We talked to experts to figure it all out and learn some of their favorite techniques. The case for using your fingers Beauty icon Bobbi Brown, founder of Jones Road Beauty, is a proponent of the benefits of skin-to-skin contact. 'Fingers are a makeup artist's go-to because the warmth of fingers melts the product into the skin, giving the most skin-like finish,' she told HuffPost. 'They're also your greatest tool for blending.' Others agree with her. 'Moisturizer, eye cream and other priming products all perform best when worked into the skin with the warmth of fingers,' makeup artist Diane da Silva told HuffPost. While she uses tools for professional work, 'I almost never use them on my own face for my day-to-day personal routine,' she said. 'I keep it very simple and often use the same color blurred onto my eyes, cheeks and lips. An imperfect application can also make it look a bit more believable. Plus, when you allow yourself five minutes for makeup, as I do, there's no time to fuss with tools.' Then there's the issue of cleanliness. As long as you're washing your hands well before applying makeup, fingers can be much cleaner than tools. 'The best of us only wash brushes and sponges thoroughly once a week,' dermatologist Loretta Ciraldo told HuffPost. 'I use my fingers to minimize any chance of spreading microbes that may be growing on brushes or sponges, including fungus, yeast or bacteria. I've even switched to Ilia's Multi-Stick or Merit Flush Balm for blush, since I can apply these directly without using a brush.' When it's best to use makeup brushes Still, makeup artists know the magic that can be achieved with time, talent and the right tools. Brown said, 'When you'd like more coverage on the skin or detail on the eyes, grab your brushes to layer additional product or color where needed.' 'When I'm working on other people, I'm a steadfast brush person,' Fiona Stiles told HuffPost. 'I deeply believe that the right brushes and tools create incredible shortcuts for achieving the look you want to create. So much about makeup is about blending, and tools really make that seamless look possible.' But not all tools are created equal, she said. 'I'm very anti Q-tip, because they leave bits of fluff on the lashes. Instead, I use tightly wound cotton buds, which don't leave cotton behind.' Many makeup artists mix and match application methods for the best results. Sebastien Tardif, co-founder of Veil Cosmetics, told HuffPost that he uses multiple tools, and fingers. One example is liquid concealer. 'I like to use a brush for placement of the product around the eyes, then I use my finger to pat into place as I like the warmth of my finger to melt it with the skin and spread it. Then I finish off the application using a fluffy concealer brush to perfect and blend to get that airbrush-like finish. I might even do one last pat with the fingertip for extra smoothing and locking into place.' Ashley Rebecca told HuffPost, 'I use both tools and my fingers, but for very specific things. For instance, I prefer to apply makeup first with brushes, then soften and lightly blend out the product with my fingers. I find that using a mix of both is really beneficial and yields seamless results.' And then there are those who are firmly Team Brush. 'Makeup brushes are the critical tools that allow you apply the product with precision, or to achieve a unique finish like airbrush,' Jamie Greenberg told HuffPost. 'Fingers are great in a pinch, but brushes will always be my go-to.' For those times when only a makeup tool will do, check out these favorites from makeup artists.

Hark back to the early days of the pandemic where in an effort to get moving, many of us went and downloaded Couch to 5K, the NHS' guided running app. The app takes the runner on nine different runs, incrementally adding time to the exercise so by the end you're able to comfortably run for 30 mins, and hopefully to the distance of 5K. But once you've completed the challenge, what next? Anyone who's finished it will know the excitement and eagerness that comes with wanting to tick off each week on the app. So when you've completed week nine, it can be difficult to muster the same enthusiasm to keep moving.  Don't let nine weeks of expert running go to waste though. There are still ways to motivate yourself to keep up all the good work. Especially as the weather gets warmer, you'll want to get out for a run.  Try a different app For many, a guided run is better than its counterpart - it's always encouraging having someone in your ear telling you you're doing great or that you only have five minutes left. If that's the kind of support you're looking for, there's options such as the Nike Run Club app or Runtastic, which offer stats such as distance, duration, speed, pace, calories burned, elevation gain and heart rate. You can also set yourself a new target - such as 8K or 10K, so you have something to work towards.  Get the gear A good run requires good gear. While you might be used to an old pair of running shoes, might you entice yourself to get back on the pavement with some shiny new gear? If you know you have a stylish pair of trainers, or new Lululemon leggings to break into, a half an hour run might just do the trick.  Sign up to a 5k That might sound a little daunting but remember, before you joined Couch to 5K, the idea of running for 30 consecutive minutes also seemed challenging.  Athlete and HYROX (fitness competition) trainer Jade Skillen says if you sign up to something more difficult, it'll motivate you to keep achieving your goals.  'For somebody who has just completed their first couch to 5km, they should keep motivation high by setting another goal for themselves,' she tells HuffPost. 'Start to look out for the next challenge, this could be using your new found love for running to signing up for a competition or race - be it with yourself or others. This could be a functional fitness event that involves running such as HYROX or striving for a new distance; 10km, half marathon, or whatever you set your mind to.' Give up running No, we don't mean stop exercising. But if you only completed Couch to 5K to feel a sense of achievement, but actually don't enjoy running, then there's no reason to force yourself. You could find a different activity that challenges and excites you and gets your heart rate going. Skillen adds: 'Incorporate some strength and functional training. Compound movements such as deadlifts and squats, plyometric exercises and core stability drills are all great things to add into your training schedule. This is ultimately why focusing on using your running achievements to direct your next challenge is a great way to expand your training methodologies, whilst also keeping up your enjoyment of training and fuelling your motivation.' Go back to Couch to 5K But if all else fails and you're struggling to get back to running without the comfort and familiarity of the NHS app then you could always just go back to it. In its new update you can choose from several celebrities to do your guided run. Theoretically you could do the challenge with a different person each time. That's one way to keep running. Move celebrates exercise in all its forms, with accessible features encouraging you to add movement into your day - because it's not just good for the body, but the mind, too. We get it: workouts can be a bit of a slog, but there are ways you can move more without dreading it. Whether you love hikes, bike rides, YouTube workouts or hula hoop routines, exercise should be something to enjoy.", "d0197e3c2250c41cb54bb3a49b1de5e309ffc743607c27b9fe51b651": "Head to Aldi for flavourful kebabs but drop into Asda for show-stopping burgers. And if you really want to impress guests, splash out on Iceland's pork ribs. Those are the just a few of the recommendations you'll find in Good Housekeeping's annual barbecue taste test, which rates the best meat and veggie BBQ products from supermarket brands and grocers.  The panel--which was made up of both expert testers and consumers--blind tasted each product, rating each on their looks, smell, taste and texture. Competition was particularly tight this year, with the panel testing a total of 121 products across all categories.  Planning a barbecue this weekend? Here's where to head for the tastiest food.  Beef burgers Coming out top for beef burgers, Asda's Extra Special 4 Salt and Cracked Black Pepper Beef Burgers (PS3.30 for 4) scored 77/100. The panel applauded the beef burger's bold, umami flavours and well-balanced yet simple seasoning.  Farmison came a very close second with its Hand Press Steak & Bone Marrow Burger (PS10.95 for 4), which scored a respectable 76/100. The tasting panel loved how well the burgers were seasoned, noting the umami notes from the bone marrow. They liked that the burger was deep and complex, being described as both 'meaty' and 'peppery', with a kick of heat.  Flavoured burgers  Asda's beef burgers reign continues with its Extra Special British Beef Burger with Truffle & Parmesan Melt (PS3.00 for 2) voted best in the flavoured burgers category, too, scoring a high 86/100. The panel said that the burger was 'succulent' and 'oh-so indulgent' with a bechamel-like cheese topper, gaining top marks for taste.  The runner-up for flavoured burgers was M&S, with its Chilli Cheese Beef Burger (PS4.50 for 2) which scored 81/100. Testers noted that the burgers had 'a really lovely hit of chilli that pairs well with cheddar', noting that they looked 'indulgent and moreish.'  Sausages The battle of the bangers was won by M&S, thanks to its Bacon & Cheese Sausage Swirl (PS4.50 for 300g) scoring 85/100. This centrepiece is packed with herbs and black pepper, then topped with a glossy BBQ-style sauce. The panel hailed the 'cheesy notes at the fore, with a touch of smokiness to finish', adding that the BBQ sauce was 'sweet and mouth-watering'. It was praised for being 'like a decadent cheesy hotdog in one mouthful, perfect for a big white bap'. Coming in second were the Tesco Finest 4 Pork, Cheese & Jalapeno Hot Dogs (PS2.60 for 400g), scoring 77/100. Taste-wise, these sausages have light spicing and jalapeno tang that builds. The panel liked the faint hint of chives, which adds freshness to the pork and red Leicester.  Kebabs  When it comes to kebabs, Farmison's Yakitori Chicken Skewers (PS10.95 for 4) scored 85/100, taking first place. The Asian influence was spotlighted by the panel, with testers praising the meat for being like a 'classic, spiced, umami-heavy chicken dish in a good quality Japanese restaurant', adding that the pockets of sauce had a great caramelised depth. The chicken is corn-fed and sold pre-marinated, with skewers provided to thread yourself at home.  Aldi did particularly well on the kebabs front, too. The Aldi Ashfields Grill Garlic & Rosemary Lamb Kebabs (PS2.99 for 4) scored 83/100, coming in a close second to Farmison. The panel loved that the skewers had an initial natural sweetness from the lamb, with the mint sauce adding a well-balanced tang. Meat-free Meat-free options have made great strides this year, with a total of 35 products being tested in total. The Beyond Burger (PS4.00 for 2) took the crown for best meat-free burgers, scoring 86/100. The panel unanimously agreed that the burger was an excellent meat replacement, praising the overall flavour for being well-balanced with a lightly smoky aroma.  The runner-up was the Co-op GRO The Bhaji Burger (PS2.50 for 2) scoring 90/100. Packed with veggies and bold, bhaji spices, our panel loved the chilli depth and aromatics at play in this vegan patty.  There were some strong contenders for alternative sausages, too. In first place, with an impressive score of 89/100, was Tesco with its Tesco Plant Chef 6 Cumberland Style Bangers(PS1.75 for 6). The panel loved the black pepper in these sausages, but the winning factor was the texture: the perfect balance of melt-in-the-mouth filling and a crispy skin. THIS Isn't Pork Sausages (PS3.00 for 6) scored 83/100 coming in second, and were hailed for their rich, meaty and 'marmite-like' flavour.  The showstoppers And finally, the panel crowned two 'BBQ heroes' for those who want to really impress guests and add something a little different in the mix.  Iceland's TGI Maple BBQ King Pork Ribs (PS7.00 for 700g) came in first place with a score 90/100, while Asda's Ultimate Extra Special Tomahawk Steak (PS25 for 1kg) was crowned runner up.

A spokeswoman for Boris Johnson said the frontbencher's behaviour was 'wholly unacceptable' and vowed that the MP concerned would be punished. She said: 'The chief whip is looking into this matter.  'This behaviour is wholly unacceptable and action will be taken.' According to the Sun and Mirror, the unnamed Tory MP was caught watching porn on his mobile phone while sitting next to a female minister in parliament. Female Tory MPs complained about the behaviour at a meeting of Tory parliamentarians on Tuesday night. On Wednesday night, a Conservative Party spokesperson said the matter was being referred to the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme. 'Upon the conclusion of any ICGS investigation the chief whip will take appropriate action,' the spokesperson said. Other female MPs at Tuesday night's meeting shared their experiences of harassment and sexism in Westminster. The revelations come just days after a sexism row broke out over a story in the Mail on Sunday about Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner. The article, which has been condemned across the political divide, quoted an unnamed Tory MP suggesting that the deputy leader tries to distract the prime minister by crossing and uncrossing her legs. The Sunday Times also revealed that 56 MPs -- including three cabinet ministers and two shadow cabinet ministers -- are under investigation for sexual misconduct. Asked about the misconduct claims in parliament, Johnson said if they were proven then that would be 'grounds for dismissal' for ministers. Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said: 'Fifty six members of this House are under investigation for sexual misconduct. That includes three of his cabinet ministers. 'The prime minister has just rightly said that there can be no place for sexism and misogyny in this House, so can he now confirm whether he considers that sexual harassment, apparently unlike bullying and lying, is grounds for dismissal under the ministerial code?' Johnson replied: 'Of course sexual harassment is intolerable and it is quite right that members should now have a procedure by which they can bring that to the attention of the House authorities and I think that is a good thing, and of course it is grounds for dismissal.'", "682b8a727c36bfb1bbf1dba926ee0d63e27afea9d34e2a7895707d1a": "Boris Johnson's ethics adviser has cleared Rishi Sunak of breaching the ministerial code over his family's tax affairs. The chancellor referred himself to Lord Geidt after it was revealed that his multi-millionaire wife, Akshata Murty, had 'non-domicile' status, allowing her to avoid paying UK taxes on her foreign income. Following a public backlash, Sunak wrote to Geidt saying he hoped referring his declarations for investigation would provide 'further clarity' for the public. In a letter to Johnson published on Wednesday, Geidt confirmed that he did not believe Sunak had broken the ministerial code. He said: 'I advise that the requirements of the ministerial code have been adhered to by the chancellor and that he has been assiduous in meeting his obligations and in engaging with this investigation. 'In reaching these judgments, I am confined to the question of conflicts of interest and the requirements of the ministerial code. 'My role does not touch on any wider question of the merits of such interests or arrangements.' Sunak was plunged into the centre of a storm when The Independent revealed Murty's non-dom status -- which potentially saved her millions of pounds in UK taxes -- as households up and down the country feel the impact of the rising cost of living. Murty later announced that she would start paying UK rates of tax on her foreign wealth -- derived from her shares in her billionaire father's Indian company Infosys -- to avoid the issue becoming a 'distraction' for her husband. Geidt said he had found two potential instances Murty's tax status 'could have given rise to a conflict of interest' for the chancellor but that 'appropriate steps were taken'. In the first instance he said the issue was properly declared, and in the second -- concerning a proposed change in arrangement for some non-doms -- had no bearing on Murty's interests and that she was unaffected by the change. 'Therefore, in both instances, no conflict arose as a result of Murty's nondomiciled tax status.' Geidt also looked at claims that the chancellor continued to hold a US green card 18 months into his role in No. 11, as well as a blind investment trust set up when he was made chief secretary to the Treasury in July last year.  On the green card issue, Geidt said he did not believe that possessing one would constitute 'an inherent conflict of interest'. 'Being subject to the obligations imposed by the card in his personal life could not reasonably be said to be in tension with the faithful discharge of his duties as chief secretary to the Treasury or as chancellor of the exchequer,' he wrote. The ethics tsar also said he was satisfied that there was no conflict of interest over Sunak's blind investment trust after he was assured by the chancellor that he does not have 'live knowledge' of the contents. Murty's shareholding in Infosys was also 'properly declared', Geidt ruled, adding that it held no contracts with the Treasury while her husband has been at the helm. The saga of Sunak's tax affairs appears to have dented his popularity with Tory party members as well as his chances of succeeding Johnson as PM if he is ousted by MPs angry over partygate. A recent chart compiled by the ConservativeHome website put his net rating at minus 5.2 on April 25 from 7.9 at the start of the month.  A survey by Ipsos taken in early April also found more Britons think Sunak is doing a bad job as chancellor, rather than a good job. Up to 37 per cent now thought Sunak was doing a bad job while 30 per cent said he was doing a good job.

The chancellor said it was better to wait six months until the autumn, when the new energy price cap is set, to see whether costs were still soaring. However, he insisted he was ready to come up with more support then if it was required. Sunak made his comments during a 25-minute interview on Mumsnet. He was asked by a disabled person whether the government would offer more support to cover energy bills.   The chancellor said they had already unveiled a PS9bn package to bring down the cost of electricity and gas, as well as council tax bills. He added: 'Now I know people are anxious about this and wondering if they are going to go up even more, and I have always been clear from the beginning we will see what happens.     'And depending on what happens to bills then, of course, if we need to act and provide support for people, we will.     'But it would be silly to do that now or last month or the month before when we don't know exactly what the situation in the autumn will be.    'So I'd say we'll see where we are with that if we need to do more.' Boris Johnson has called on his ministers to come up with ideas on how to bring down the cost of living. However, Sunak has insisted that any new measures should not cost the Treasury any more money as he seeks to tackle the mounting public debt. The PM chaired a meeting of the cabinet yesterday at which he impressed upon them the need to help people keep more of their money. But his spokesman said: 'He underlined the importance of not feeding in to further inflation rises and emphasised that the UK is currently spending PS80 billion servicing our debt.'  Transport secretary Grant Shapps has proposed that car MOTs take place every two years rather than annually, while the government is also keen on reforming health and safety rules to bring down childcare costs. However, a plan to slash tariffs on things like imported grain in order to reduce food prices has led to a cabinet split.

So far, the government has proposed reducing MOTs on cars to just once every two years, rather than keeping it as an annual obligation. Cuts to childcare costs were put on the table too, as ministers considered easing health and safety rules. When pressed about his own ideas at that meeting the follow day, justice secretary Dominic Raab also seemed particularly enthusiastic although he did not actually disclose any of his own plans. However, not everyone shared his excitement about the proposed changes ahead. Torsten Bell, chief executive of Resolution Foundation - a think tank which specialises in living standards - made his opposition to such plans very clear in a scathing Twitter thread of Tuesday. He began by pointing out that if the only answers are childcare reforms and changing MOTs, 'then we have lost the plot'. Here's why. 1. Changes to childcare wouldn't come into effect for 'years' The BBC learned this week that Johnson was particularly keen on reducing childcare costs by easing health and safety rules during Tuesday's meeting. Sources claimed that he wanted to lower the legal limits of adult supervision for children in England. At the moment, there must be at least one staff member for every three children for any groups where the kids are aged two and under. For those over two, there can be one member of staff for every four children. But, as Bell tweeted: 'Whatever you think about watering down childcare regulations to lower costs, it's not an answer to today's crisis. 'Impact would be years off and while it's poor households being crucified by rising energy bills, it's richer households that are more likely to use formal childcare.' Labour's Bridget Phillipson, shadow education secretary, has echoed this message and said the idea would 'drive down quality whilst making no difference to availability'. The Liberal Democrats also accused the prime minister of 'cutting corners' and 'endangering' our children. 2. Changing MOTs won't help those affected by the crisis Transport secretary Grant Shapps proposed reducing annual MOT test to once every two years. All vehicles over three years old need to have a MOT test certificate to check it is safe on the road. This can cost up to PS54.85 for a car. Implementing this measure would therefore save motorists around PS27.43 per year. Bell tweeted: 'More people have cars than kids - and at least targeting the cost of driving is targeted at a source of cost pressures. 'But again, poorer households won't benefit most: a third of poorer households have no care access versus 5% of the richest.' The AA has also argued it will make costs larger in the long run due to higher repair bills and would affect road safety. According to Sky News, a spokesperson for the AA said: 'Though well intended, moving the yearly PS55 spend on an MOT to every two years could make costs worse for drivers with higher repair bills, make our roads more dangerous and would put jobs in the garage industry at risk.' 3. It's energy prices that are the problem Bell said successful policy making is 'recognising the question that needs answering' - and in this case, it's the skyrocketing energy price rises. At the beginning of April, energy regulator Ofgem lifted the energy price cap meaning the average household would see a PS700 increase in its yearly energy bills, and prices are expected to rise again in October. Bank Investec even warned that bills could reach PS3,000 per year as the Ukraine war added to the surging global demand. The Resolution Foundation warned earlier this year that this 'fuel stress' would apply to 6.3 million households across the UK, particularly pensioners and those who live in local authority housing.  The think tank warned then that UK households are facing a 'catastrophe' when it comes to cost of living, while rising food prices and a hike in National Insurance - along with the highest rate of inflation for 30 years - create a high intensity situation. As Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey pointed out, the prime minister seems to be 'completely out of ideas during the most profound crisis in decades'. So what can be done instead? Bell concluded that the cost of living crisis has hit those from low to middle income households the hardest, so the only conclusion is reducing the costs for, or raising the income of, these homes. He added: 'The benefits system is by far the easiest way to do that.' The Lib Dems along with Labour and the SNP have called for an emergency budget and cut in VAT, as well as a proposal for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies' profits. However, such changes seem unlikely as the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, appears reluctant to pour any more money in to fix the problem. He just highlighted the PS22 billion he's already announced to reduce energy and council tax bills during the cabinet meeting on Tuesday. The PM's spokesman explained this week: 'He [Sunak] underlined the importance of not feeding into further inflation rises and emphasised that the UK is currently spending PS80 billion servicing our debt.' Johnson has, however, threatened to privatise the Passport Office and other publicly funded organisations if they do not start delivering better value for money. He told TalkTV on Tuesday: 'I'm not going to rule anything out. I don't mind if it's public or private, what I want is to deliver value for money and help keep people's costs down.'", "00d6238a7161752a48d20f5d2bb0f04b673ac3c87b42e169e988f4b4": "Boris Johnson has taken a swipe at Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle for trying to summon Mail on Sunday journalists to parliament over the paper's much-criticised report on Angela Rayner. The prime minister's spokesman said his boss was 'uncomfortable' at reporters having to answer to politicians. Hoyle demanded a meeting with the paper's editor, David Dillion, following an outcry over claims the Labour deputy leader crossed and uncrossed her legs during prime minister's Questions to distract Boris Johnson.  But in his reponse to the Speaker, published in sister The Daily Mail newspaper, Dillon said he would not be attending as journalists should 'not take instruction from officials of the House of Commons, however august they may be'. Asked abut the row, the PM's spokesman suggested Johnson was on the side of the newspaper. He said: 'The prime minister is uncomfortable with our free press being summoned by politicians 'We have a free press in this country and reporters must be free to report what they are told as they see fit.' The spokesman said Mr Johnson would not want 'any perception of politicians seeking to in any way curb or control what a free press seeks to report'.  In a statement yesterday, Hoyle said he wanted to use the meeting to ask that 'we are all a little kinder', issuing a plea to reporters to consider the feelings of MPs and their families when covering stories in parliament.  'I firmly believe in the duty of reporters to cover parliament, but I would also make a plea - nothing more - for the feelings of all MPs and their families to be considered, and the impact on their safety, when articles are written. I would just ask that we are all a little kinder.   'That is what I wanted to talk about at tomorrow's meeting.'  Appearing on ITV's Lorraine programme on Tuesday, Rayner said: 'When I heard the story was coming out and we rebutted it instantly... like this is disgusting, it's completely untrue, please don't run a story like that,' she said.   'All I worry about when I'm at the despatch box is doing a good job and being able to do justice to my constituents and the work I'm doing, so I was just really crestfallen that somebody had said that to a paper and a paper was reporting that.'

But even by his standards, he managed to be spectacularly incorrect about the UK job figures during his latest appearance before MPs. At prime minister's questions, Johnson was in bullish form as he rejected Keir Starmer's claims that the government was failing to get to grips with the cost of living crisis. The Labour leader said: 'He sounds like the Comical Ali of the cost of living crisis. He pretends the economy is booming... but in the real world our growth is set to be slower than every G20 country except one - Russia. 'And our inflation is going to be double the rest of the G7. Does he think that denying the facts staring him in the face makes things better or worse for working people?' But the PM hit back, insisting there were '500,000 more people in paid employment now than there were before the pandemic began'. But according to the highly-respected Office for National Statistics, there are actually around 500,000 fewer people employed in the UK now than there were pre-Covid. Between January and March 2020, just as the pandemic began, the ONS said there were 33,012,000 aged 16 and over in employment. But between December 2021 and February this year - the most recent period for which figures are available - that number had actually fallen to 32,485,000. It's not the first time Johnson has been caught out bending the truth about the number of people in work.  The UK Statistics Authority has previously berated the prime minister for wrongly claiming employment levels are higher now than before Covid.  While the number of people on payrolls is higher than before the pandemic, this is more than offset by the number of self-employed people who are no longer working.  Johnson's latest gaffe came just a week after he wrongly claimed that the government is 'cutting taxes for everybody'. But the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think-tank has said this is not true.  The IFS pointedly branded Rishi Sunak a 'fiscal illusionist' last month for claiming to have cut taxes when in fact he was allowing them to go up.

Speaking to Lorraine Kelly on Wednesday, Alan said that going on his latest stand-up tour had been like 'therapy' to him following their divorce.  Joking that he and Paul had been together for '207 years' in 'gay years', he said: 'I wrote the tour and then our marriage broke down during Covid, because it was so stressful and everything. 'Then I was going onstage, and I was just like 'this doesn't make sense'.' He continued: 'So we're divorced now. He's excited about the future, I'm excited about the future, but we'll still always be friends because we've been through so much.' He said his latest comedy material on his Regional Trinket tour is 'from the heart', adding: 'It's quite emotional, uplifting and it was actually my therapy really.'

He was released after two 'harrowing' nights in custody following a successful appeal against the ruling, with a judge telling him that he should be given the opportunity to turn his life around.

Earlier this month, the former This Morning presenter sparked controversy when he responded to a US TV interview with the Duke Of Sussex, in which he said he wanted to make sure the Queen had 'the right people around her'. Discussing Harry on his GB News breakfast show, which he hosts with Isabel Webster, Eamonn said: 'He's bringing a book out where he's slagging off Camilla and maybe William and his father. 'How on earth... why wouldn't they just throw him over the balcony and her with him?' The comments were met with criticism on social media at the time, with TV watchdog Ofcom confirming to HuffPost UK it has received 402 complaints about the broadcast.  As is standard procedure, the complaints will be assessed before Ofcom decides whether to launch an official investigation.  Eamonn, who left his long-standing hosting role on ITV's This Morning in December to join GB News, has long been a critic of the royal couple.  In 2019, he sparked a row after using the word 'uppity' - which historically was used in the US in the 19th Century as an insult to Black people who 'didn't know their place' - to describe the Duchess of Sussex on This Morning.  While it was later reported that Eamonn had been 'reprimanded' for his comments, a spokesperson for ITV denied this, but did say it had been a 'point of learning' for him.

This may be a significant turning point in the Ukrainian war, two months after Russia's president Vladimir Putin first ordered an unprovoked attack on its neighbouring nation. Poland and Bulgaria are now looking to find other sources of natural gas and preparing for the reality that Russia could soon block its oil exports, too. But the move is not going to do Russia any favours either. Here's everything we know so far. How is Russia 'blackmailing' European countries? On Wednesday, the majority state-owned Russian gas company, Gazprom, released a statement explaining that it had 'completely suspended gas supplies' going to Poland and Bulgaria. These countries are essential transmit states for the Russian exports. They were warned by the energy giant that if there was any unauthorised withdrawal of gas re-routed to other European countries, their supplies would be reduced by the same amount in retaliation.  In response, Polish gas company PGNiG said it was reserving 'the right to seek compensation', and intends to use 'all available' means to do so.  This dramatic decision from Moscow also comes after repeated Ukrainian appeals for Europe to stop funding the Russian invasion by buying their energy supplies elsewhere. Europe uses Russia for more than a third of its gas, and Gazprom has a monopoly on the pipelines the country, so cutting off Poland and Bulgaria's supplies is an incendiary move from Moscow. Gazprom claims it was following Putin's decree issued last month about how countries should pay for their Russian gas exports.  Why did Putin order this? The Russian president declared in March that all energy payments for Russian gas must be paid in roubles, the Russian currency. This was heavily resisted by European countries, as it would have helped prop up Russia's economy - effectively undoing the strict sanctions placed on the Kremlin over the invasion. The speaker of the lower house of Russia's parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin, even encouraged the company to take similar action against other 'unfriendly' nations. What will happen to Poland and Bulgaria? So far, neither nation seems too concerned. Poland's deputy foreign minister Marcin Przydacz declared that Russia was looking to 'foster divisions' between Western allies. Its state gas company has bought 53% of its gas imports from Gazprom this year so far. However, Warsaw claims it can source gas elsewhere (such as Azerbaijan) and it has been preparing for such a situation for years. Poland's PGNiG gas giant said its underground gas storage was close to 80% full and that with summer coming up, it was expecting demand for energy to drop. In Bulgaria, the prime minister Kiril Petkov said the country was reconsidering its contracts with Gazprom, which include moving Russian gas to Serbia and Hungary, pointing out: 'One-sided blackmail was not acceptable.' The country uses Gazprom for 90% of its gas supply but it is looking for alternative sources. For now, no restrictions are in place.  How has the rest of Europe responded? Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy's chief of staff - Andriy Yermak - said that Russia was 'beginning the gas blackmail of Europe', and using its gas supplies as a 'weapon'. He called for the EU to 'impose an embargo on energy resources, depriving the Russians of their energy weapons'. Deputy prime minister Dominic Raab said this move was only contributing to its 'pariah status' by threatening other countries. He told Sky News: 'We will stand shoulder to shoulder with our Polish friends and allies, they've said they can deal with this but of course it will have a very damaging effect on Russia as well. 'Because it is becoming further and further, more and more, not just a political pariah but an economic pariah and that will put the squeeze ultimately on Vladimir Putin. 'But one thing is true and clear. We cannot allow his bullying behaviour, whether it's economic warfare or military warfare, to succeed.' European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen dubbed the move 'blackmail', and warned the EU was coming up with a 'co-ordinated' response to this 'unjustified and unacceptable' act from Russia. However, Slovakia and Hungary have worked out separate deals with Gazprom, by paying a euro-denominated account into Gazprobank which then deposits the amount in roubles. Still, von der Leyen said Moscow's behaviour showed Russia's 'unreliability' as an energy supplier and maintained that the EU is 'prepared' for this. She promised that leaders have been working to 'ensure alternative deliveries and the best possible storage levels across the EU'.", "5f5209048b9e9551bdfa3157b57db183773b949d3faccee6e295297c": "The government broke the law by sending hospital patients into care homes at the start of the pandemic, the High Court has ruled. Judges said ministers failed to take into account the risk to elderly and vulnerable residents from non-symptomatic transmission of Covid. Two women, Cathy Gardner and Fay Harris, whose fathers died from virus, had challenged the health secretary and Public Health England over the policy. Lord Justice Bean and Mr Justice Garnham concluded that policies contained in documents released in March and early April 2020 were unlawful. Former health secretary Matt Hancock had claimed the government had put 'a protective ring' around care home residents when the pandemic began. But in their ruling, the judges said: 'In our judgment, this was not a binary question - a choice between on the one hand doing nothing at all, and on the other hand requiring all newly admitted residents to be quarantined. 'The document could, for example, have said that where an asymptomatic patient, other than one who has tested negative, is admitted to a care home, he or she should, so far as practicable, be kept apart from other residents for up to 14 days. 'Since there is no evidence that this question was considered by the Secretary of State, or that he was asked to consider it, it is not an example of a political judgment on a finely balanced issue. 'Nor is it a point on which any of the expert committees had advised that no guidance was required. 'The drafters of the documents of March 17 and April 2 simply failed to take into account the highly relevant consideration of the risk to elderly and vulnerable residents from asymptomatic transmission.' Dr Gardner's 88-year-old father died at a care home in Bicester, Oxfordshire, in April 2020. A barrister representing the two women told the court at a hearing in March that between March and June 2020 more than 20,000 elderly or disabled care home residents had died from Covid-19 in England and Wales. Jason Coppel QC said the fathers of Dr Gardner and Ms Harris were part of that 'toll'. 'The care home population was known to be uniquely vulnerable to being killed or seriously harmed by Covid-19,' said Mr Coppel in a written case outline. 'The Government's failure to protect it, and positive steps taken by the Government which introduced Covid-19 infection into care homes, represent one of the most egregious and devastating policy failures in the modern era.' Mr Coppel told judges: 'That death toll should not and need not have happened.' Charlie Williams, spokesperson for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, said: 'I lost my father in a care home back in April 2020. We kept him there because we had been told that no one in the care home had covid, that he would be safe, but later we learned from the staff, who were fantastic, that 27 patients had in fact died from the virus there. 'For the thousands of families like mine who lost loved ones in care homes, the last two years of cover ups and denials have been unbelievably painful. 'We've always known that our loved ones were thrown to the wolves by the government, and the claims made by Matt Hancock that a 'protective ring' was made around care homes was a sickening lie. 'Now a court has found their decisions unlawful and it's clear the decisions taken led to people dying who may otherwise still be with their loved ones today. 'We now need to see those responsible for those dark days held accountable and lessons learned to save lives, ensuring the grim scenes of spring 2020 are never repeated again.'"}
