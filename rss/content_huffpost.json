{"910497364d0392cfcbf065289296ab9f92a0904d0f64b8d3fd1bed7c": "An appearance by culture secretary Nadine Dorries at a select committee hearing is becoming must-watch TV. In November, the gaffe-prone Tory minister didn't fully grasp how Channel 4 was funded - an important detail since she is in charge of selling-off the broadcaster. And on Thursday, Dorries left viewers stunned as she responded to questions from the digital, culture, media and sport committee of MPs about online safety and public service broadcasters. Specifically, she was quizzed about the government's decision on Channel 4, the review of the BBC's funding model and where Netflix and its subscription model fits in. Here are her best bits. 1. Sharing Netflix account: 'Am I not supposed to do that?' The culture secretary admitted she shares her Netflix password with four other households across the country. Dorries said four other people, including her mother, have access to her account with the streaming service, in breach of its terms and conditions which say users must live together.  She described the current system for subscribers as 'incredibly generous'. She added: 'My mum has access to my account, the kids do. I have Netflix but there are four other people who can use my Netflix account in different parts of the country.' Laughing, she added: 'Am I not supposed to do that?' Her department's permanent secretary, Sarah Healey, reportedly told her that password sharing was not allowed on the service.  2. Channel 4 'didn't do themselves any favours' Asked what she thinks about Channel 4 News, Dorries said she 'gets on really well' with presenter Cathy Newman and had been asked on a number of times in the last two weeks, although she had declined. But in an apparent reference to eyewitness reports that former anchor Jon Snow shouted 'Fuck the Tories' while at Glastonbury Festival five years ago, she added: 'I have been on Channel 4 News a number of times. It is edgy. I am not going to justify a news programme whose anchor went out shouting obscenities about the Conservative Party. 'So they didn't do themselves any favours sometimes on the news programme and I think that is probably as much as I want to say about that.' 3. Fears profitable Channel 4 will 'hits the buffers' Dorries said Channel 4's pool of advertising budget had 'reduced considerably', justifying the decision to sell off the broadcaster, and that a platform such as Netflix would be another attractive prospect to advertisers. She said: 'If Channel 4 were to suffer as a result of decreased advertising, if all the advertising pool decided to go and spend it all on Netflix advertising ... if Channel 4 hits the buffers it's up to the government to pick that up, the taxpayer.' But Channel 4 achieved record financial results last year - something the government could only dream of - while Netflix last month suffered its first subscriber loss in more than a decade, causing its shares to plunge 25% in extended trading. Channel 4 has been publicly owned since its creation in 1982 by the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher, and is entirely funded by advertising. 4. 'I think the figure was about 96%' Dorries was asked by the SNP's John Nicolson about her Channel 4 privatisation consultation, and how many people supported the move 'I think the figure was about 96%,' she replied, fairly confidently. But Nicolson corrected her afterwards, saying 'the answer, of course, is 96% opposed privatisation'. 5. 'They were actually actors' In another attack on Channel 4, Dorries accused the broadcaster of hiring paid actors for a reality television show she appeared in 12 years ago. Dorries was one of four new MPs to appear in Tower Block of Commons, where they all spent a week living on a different housing estate. At one stage, she apparently smuggled in a PS50 note, which she claimed was intended to buy gifts for the children of her hosts. During the hearing on Thursday, Dorries claimed the hosts were planted by the show's producers, and that a 'pharmacist or somebody that I went to see who prepared food' was also a paid actress. A Channel 4 spokesperson: 'This is the first suggestion we have heard that viewers were misled about contributors on Tower Block of Commons. We will be contacting the secretary of state to seek further details so that we can investigate it thoroughly.'", "8513ea378fccfd11afe4c045f8c034cf2675ebcc0f08c60466de4c94": "Rihanna's reign of supreme maternity fashion seems to have come to an end -- for now at least. The Love on the Brain singer and her boyfriend, rapper A$AP Rocky, welcomed their first child, a baby boy, on May 13 in Los Angeles, sources told TMZ and Entertainment Tonight. Neither Rihanna nor Rocky has publicly confirmed the birth, and their reps did not respond to HuffPost's requests for comment.  The pair announced they were expecting a child in January, and Rihanna has since redefined pregnancy fashion.   The Savage X Fenty creator wore one of her most memorable looks during Paris Fashion Week in March: a see-through overlay, cape, knee-high boots and a strappy G-string from her own lingerie line.  In the final days of the Barbados National Hero's pregnancy, Rocky dropped a video for his new single, D.M.B. (Dats Mah B**ch), which co-starred Rihanna.   In the video, Rocky proposes to Rihanna with a grill that says 'Marry Me?' and Rihanna responds by baring a grill that says 'I do.' The video ends with the couple tying the knot. (It's unclear if the couple is married in real life.)       Rihanna told Vogue in April that Rocky 'became my family' during a road trip from Los Angeles to New York in the summer of 2020. She described spending time on the road, away from the public eye.   'I cooked our food on this little janky grill I bought from Walmart,' she said. 'I still have it, too. It works like nobody's business.'   She told the outlet that she and Rocky have a lot of fun together.   'I love the simple things, but also the grand adventures. There's no pretentious my-brand-your-brand bullshit, it's just us living,' said said. 'I just feel like I can do any part of life by his side.'   This is a breaking news story and will be updated.

The culture secretary described the news programme as 'edgy' when she was quizzed on the government's proposal to privatise the broadcaster. Dorries told MPs she 'gets on really well' with presenter Cathy Newman and had been asked on by her a number of times in the past two weeks. But, in an apparent reference to reports that former anchor Jon Snow shouted 'F*** the Tories' at Glastonbury Festival, she added: 'I have been on Channel 4 News a number of times. It is edgy. 'I am not going to justify a news programme whose anchor went out shouting obscenities about the Conservative Party. 'So they didn't do themselves any favours sometimes on the news programme and I think that is probably as much as I want to say about that.' The broadcaster has been publicly-owned since its creation in 1982 by Margaret Thatcher's government and is entirely funded by advertising. Dorries said she 'can't see a scenario' in which a privately-owned Channel 4 would become partly or wholly subscription-based. Giving evidence to the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee on Thursday, Dorries added: 'As a public service broadcaster that is not on the table, that is just not on the cards at all. I can't see a scenario in which that would happen.' The plans to privatise Channel 4 have come in for severe criticism, including from Conservative MPs. Tory backbencher Sir Peter Bottomley, the longest-serving MP in the Commons, said: 'Channel 4 is in the best state it's been creatively and financially for decades.' He suggested that ministers may have been offended by some of its news coverage - such as replacing Boris Johnson with a melting ice sculpture in a climate change debate - and added that the 'government could do best by leaving it alone'. Damian Green, another former Tory minister, expressed 'profound scepticism' about the government's privatisation plans and said the media industry was united in 'saying Channel 4 isn't broke and doesn't need fixing in this way'. Channel 4 news editor Esme Wren said: 'Channel 4 News is internationally-renowned for the depth and quality of its coverage ranging from the climate crisis to Oscar-nominated doc For Sama to the war in Ukraine. 'Since the start of 2022, C4N has seen the biggest increase in audience share across all the PSB national main news programmes and is up by 43% among younger viewers aged 16-34 year-on-year. 'C4N confirmed its new presenter line-up last month following the departure of Jon Snow, with Krishnan Guru-Murthy, Matt Frei, Cathy Newman and Jackie Long anchoring the programme. We are also recruiting a new Leeds-based presenter.'", "bfd8eadb6c030de44527e3934d65e4809047a8469222eb8acca12586": "Bruno Tonioli has permanently stepped down from the judging panel of Strictly Come Dancing, it has been confirmed. The Italian choreographer and dancer had been a Strictly judge since the show's launch in 2004, but took a two-year break in 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic and his work commitments in the US. For last year's series, long-serving Strictly pro Anton Du Beke took over the seat usually occupied by Bruno, alongside regular judges Craig Revel Horwood, Shirley Ballas and Motsi Mabuse. However, he did take part in the 2022 Strictly tour, judging with Craig and Shirley at shows around the UK. It's now been announced that Bruno will not be back on Strictly when it returns for its landmark 20th series later this year. On Thursday, the BBC confirmed in a press release - which, interestingly, did not mention Bruno's exit - that the judging panel for this year's series would once again consist of Craig, Motsi, Shirley and Anton. Speaking about his return to the panel, Anton said: 'Woohooo! This is BRILLIANT news. Everyone knows how much I absolutely love the show and I'm utterly delighted to be continuing as a regular judge. 'And I get to make the final again - now I know how Giovanni feels!' In the lead-up to the announcement, there had been lots of speculation about whether he would ever be back on Strictly, with both Craig and Shirley suggesting publicly that a five-person panel with both Bruno and Anton could be a potential solution. Earlier this week, it was reported by the Daily Mail that Bruno had made the decision not to resume his usual slot on Strictly. The BBC had no comment when contacted by HuffPost UK about this at the time. Bruno is expected to continue his judging duties on the show's US counterpart Dancing With The Stars, where he sits alongside former Strictly colleague Len Goodman, Derek Hough and Carrie Ann Inaba. He won't be the only familiar face not returning when the new series of Strictly debuts, with fan favourites Oti Mabuse and Aljaz Skorjanec both announcing their exits earlier this year. Strictly will begin airing on BBC One in its usual autumn slot.", "e57c388db88e3a092b4fc59d7cf02423347fa21fd51e54f5093bd869": "Our beds are our safe haven. There's nothing like coming home from a long day and snuggling under a duvet. We spend several hours in our beds each day, which is why it's essential to make sure our beds are clean.  For most people, making their bed each morning is part of keeping their bed clean and tidy. But apparently, we shouldn't be making our beds at all. TikTok user @sherifelsahly caught our attention recently by saying we should never ever make our beds in the morning. Our beds attract dust mites and making your bed first thing in the morning will allow them to keep growing, he said. 'But if you keep your bed unmade it exposes the dust mites to light and fresh air which actually helps kill them off,' he added.  And it seems he's onto something. The average adult loses 285ml of fluid each night, according to The Sleep Council.  What this means is that when you make your bed each morning, you are trapping in all of that moisture to fester during the day, ready to be slept on again in the evening. We should actually be pulling back the bed linen to give the mattress the chance to breathe and for moisture to evaporate. This is because moisture can get trapped between the mattress and the linen causing discolouration and potentially odours. Doing this will ensure your mattress lasts longer. They also advise us how we can clean our mattresses.  How to clean a mattress   Don't use a vacuum: it seems tempting to vacuum dust and fluff from your mattress but the powerful suction of a vacuum cleaner can cause the filling to become dislodged which can lead to bumps and dips. Instead use a soft brush to remove the debris onto the floor, which can then be vacuumed.   Blot don't scrub: stains should be immediately tackled by blotting with a clean cloth. If your mattress is filled with natural fibres this should be a dry cloth, 'wet cleaning' could damage the upholstery. Other mattresses may be able to withstand warm soapy water on a rung out clean cloth, but always check the manufacturer's advice before cleaning. Hacks such as bicarbonate of soda and various harsh chemicals are not recommended.   Regularly wash your bedding and mattress protector: wash your bed linen every one to two weeks and your mattress protector once a month. Regularly cleaning these will stop any dirt seeping through the mattress, keeping it cleaner for longer. In the summer, you may have to clean your linen and protector more regularly due to sweat.   Protect to prevent, rather than clean: mattress protectors are like taking out travel insurance on holiday, you hope it isn't needed but will be glad you have it if the worst happens.   Should you flip your mattress and if so, how often? Whether you need to flip your mattress or not is dependent on the type of mattress you have.  Double-sided mattresses can be flipped and should come with the instruction to turn over regularly. For the first three months of having your mattress, it is recommended that you turn it over once a week. After that, turn it over just once a month. This will ensure that the filling is evenly placed and stop dips from forming. Single sided mattresses (such as those with memory foam on top) can not be flipped but should still be rotated 180 degrees. Like with the double-sided mattress, for the first three months it is recommended that you rotate your mattress from head to toe once a week. After that, rotate it just once a month. For natural fibre mattresses, such as those by Vispring, it is recommended that you turn your mattress over twice a week for the first three months and once a season after that. This is to firstly encourage natural and even settlement of the mattress fillings and subsequently to extend its life.  How often should we be changing our bed sheets? Mary Malone, a laundry expert at about.com, previously said that we should be washing our bed sheets regularly. Not washing your bed sheets frequently can lead to a host of health problems such as infected wounds and athletes foot. 'Infrequent cleaning of sheets and pillowcases allows the fluids to seep into the pillows and mattresses, and those are much more difficult to clean than tossing sheets in the washer,' she told ATTN. Allowing dust, sweat and dirt to build-up for just two weeks can be enough to leave you with a scratchy throat or the sniffles, according to New York University microbiologist Philip Tierno. Leaving your bedsheets unchanged can result in sweat and dirt seeping into your pillows and mattress. So how often should we be changing our sheets? The general consensus is that we should all be changing our sheets - including duvet covers and pillow cases - once a week, Tierno says.", "fc2fcd592b914327022075d643f8e6e631c5512b4bc8762b9e194718": "  We hope you love the products we recommend!

The new chief inspector of constabulary, Andy Cooke, told The Guardian on Wednesday: 'I think whenever you see an increase in the cost of living or whenever you see more people dropping into poverty, I think you'll invariable see a rise in crime. 'And that's going to be a challenge for policing to deal with.' Cooke, who is the head of the independent assessor of police forces in England and Wales, continued: 'What they've got to bear in mind is what is the best thing for the community and that individual in the way they deal with those issue. 'And I certainly fully support police officers using their discretion - and they need to use discretion more often.' He said he was not 'giving a carte blanche for people to go out shoplifting', but said he wanted officers to make sure cases were 'dealt with in the best way possible'. The poorest UK households are already expected to experience even higher levels of inflation at 10.9% - compared to 9% for the majority of other households, which is already a 40-year high. Soaring fuel costs and energy bills mean more people are struggling this year, while the Bank of England governor has warned of an 'apocalyptic' rise in food prices on the horizon. However, Cooke, a former chief constable of Merseyside police, was keen to point out that this does not mean people got a free pass for various crimes. He explained: 'There's always individual cases where you can use your discretion that doesn't necessarily result in a prosecution but is dealt with in the best way possible. And the shoplifting one's a good example, isn't it?' This conversation about discretion around food has cropped several times since energy bills and national insurance contributions soared at the beginning of April. Yet, policing minister Kit Malthouse pulled apart Cooke's claim this week. He said this was 'old-fashion thinking' if the police chief really believed the economic problems would increase crime. He told LBC radio on Thursday: 'We first of all believe the law should be blind and police officers should operate without fear or favour in prosecution of the law. 'Secondly it's not quite right to say that as the economy fluctuates so does crime. We've seen economic problems in the past, or not, when crime has risen, or not.' He also said it was 'absolutely right' that ministers make sure police do not ignore shoplifting, explaining: 'In fact I wrote to chief constables just a year or so ago saying they should not be ignoring those seemingly small crimes.' He later told Times Radio: 'It still doesn't mean that we can solve every problem, it's still going to be hard, it's going to be tough for families, and what we have to hope is that this storm of inflation will pass quite quickly.' Concerns about how the UK will cope with access to even the basics - such as heating and eating - are still growing though. MoneySavingExpert's Martin Lewis shared his deep concern that the UK will soon plummet into 'absolute poverty' on Thursday. He said: 'The public mood is desperate, it's angry...if we don't sort this...I worry about civil unrest.'", "b07fc6b798a9fcae3ba884425bb640724f8c21e73d84f8e487bc7c9c": "People always say that having a baby is one of those life experiences that really 'changes' a person -- a total cliche, perhaps, but also a pretty accurate one. This can be especially true when it comes to returning to work after maternity leave. Some mothers find they have to navigate all sorts of new practicalities -- finding childcare, concentrating after nights with little to no sleep, and figuring out finances -- while coping with all kinds of confusing and complex emotions.  Although the pandemic has helped to normalise remote, hybrid, and flexible working to a degree and even led to an increased awareness and transparency about what some mums have to juggle when it comes to having a career and children, it's fair to say that there is still a long way to go. This year, MALTESERS(r) is continuing its support of maternal mental health by raising awareness of what mums may face when they return to work after maternity leave: both the positives and the not-so-positives... Here are some practical tips that have helped real mums on the return to work: 'Don't be hard on yourself; no one is perfect.' Donna, 40, works for the Metropolitan Police in London. After giving birth to twins 4 years ago, she took 18 months' maternity leave, before returning to work for two 10-hour shifts, 2 days a week. 'I was tired, very emotional, and felt insecure due to time off and changes that had happened. I struggled with becoming a mum and how different I felt,' she explains.  Going back to such an intense work environment as a police officer also came with new, unexpected challenges. 'I never used to be scared in my role but all of a sudden, I was frightened of getting hurt and leaving the girls,' she says. What got her through the emotionally tough times was a strong support network that included her wife, mum, her wife's best friend, and her best friend. 'Take the help when offered; get the sleep when you can,' she says. 'There isn't a written rule on how to be the perfect mother.'  'One of the things I suggest people do before going off on maternity leave is to make a list of all the things they like about working / their job / their workplace.'  London-based mum of two Rhiannon works in the public sector and remembers the emotions that came with going back to the office after a year of maternity leave for her first baby and that nursery settling-in period. Thankfully, her workplace has a buddy system which helps parents returning to work feel more at ease, as well as a parent and carers network she's a part of.  'I remember my first day back in the office, a lovely colleague and fellow mum came looking for me at 9am. Without saying anything else, she said, 'You know, you get used to it and sometimes you even enjoy it,' and I was nearly in tears because she was speaking my language and I was so happy to see someone who understood,' she says.  Her top tip for mothers going back to work? Write a letter or make a list reminding yourself of what you enjoy most about your job.  'When you are feeling a little nervous on mat leave, you read this letter and then on the way back in on your first day, you read it again,' she explains.  This list can be useful for all parents (even those who aren't taking a full year of maternity leave) to help remind them of their purpose when away from their little ones, the community they've cultivated in the workplace, or even how much they like the baked goods in the office canteen. Adding career and skills goals to the list can be a good way of seeing what your career priorities were ahead of having your baby and if they've changed.  'I ended up job-sharing with my maternity cover. She specialised in the area I was less familiar with so it worked well for everyone.'  Emily, now a mum of three, was head of marketing at a charity, newly promoted to the role a few months before starting her maternity leave. She and her mat leave cover got along swimmingly and they discovered that their skill sets complemented one another's so well, they could use them to both their advantages. 'The mat leave and I met to discuss it as my boss was reticent at first but said he'd consider it,' explains Emily, adding that her former boss had left a few months before her mat leave so she hadn't worked with the new one before returning to the workplace after her first baby. 'Me and my maternity leave cover came up with a plan together and then presented it to him. She (my job share) specialised in direct marketing and I have a background in above-the-line marketing (TV, radio, press) and brand partnerships, so it worked well. We both ran projects that suited our skill sets independently and so essentially divided the role, and had one day when we were both in to discuss things and share plans.  'We had managers who reported in to us so there was always someone there who was working on the projects. And we could ask each other to oversee things on the days we were off if need be.' One of the reasons Emily felt confident proposing this more flexible-working job share idea is because she'd been hired by the company initially to implement and run a new brand identity for the charity, a task that was more or less completed by the time she'd gone off on maternity leave. She was eager to come back to a new challenge, while still retaining some flexibility. 'Our job share worked really well. We had the odd difference of opinion but on the whole ran separate projects. We both wanted it to work so we made it work,' she says. 'I certainly hadn't recovered emotionally or physically by the time I returned to work but I had the support of a couple of colleagues.' Sarah is a 43-year-old mum based in Sheffield who went back to her teaching role after 9 months of maternity leave. She found that the physical impact of a traumatic birth in which she lost two litres of blood and experienced a fourth-degree tear -- a severe laceration of the perineum caused by childbirth -- was still impacting her life when she went back to work. 'A fourth-degree tear is in many ways harder to recover from both physically and emotionally compared to a caesarean but it's rarely recognised,' Sarah explains. She relied on the help of her colleagues, who would cover for her when she required urgent access to the toilet (teachers are not usually allowed to use the facilities when teaching).  Since her teaching role requires a lot of work outside of school hours (marking, planning, etc.) with no option for work from home, there was a lot of schedule-juggling when she went back to work. Everything felt rushed, like getting from nursery drop-off at 7:30am to school on time and running out of work meetings in the afternoon to make it to pickup for her daughter.  'We had support with childcare on some days I was working but only from one set of grandparents, which was great. But because we had no one else to ask, I struggled to keep on top of the work I needed to do outside my normal working hours, housework, and time for myself or as a couple. And we felt we couldn't ask the grandparents to do more than they were already doing,' she says.  When Sarah first went back to teaching, to make the juggling act of work and early motherhood a bit more feasible, she hired some outside help around the house. 'I negotiated going back to work four days a week, with one day in the office. After a year of maternity leave, I was so excited to go in again, while also having some flexibility.' Sharon took a year of maternity leave from her job as an editor of a website and arranged to go back to work four days a week, with one day in the office. She was excited to return to a job and workplace environment she enjoyed spending time in. 'I used to say that it was so great because at home with your child, if they fall, you're worried and anxious and saying, 'Are you OK? Are you sure you're OK?' At work, if someone trips with some tea, it's more like, 'You alright?' then you turn back to what you were doing. The lack of responsibility was freeing.' Going back to the office one day a week and working the other three days remotely while her daughter went to nursery was the right balance for Sharon, who maintained this schedule for the next year and a bit, before deciding to take on a more freelance, part-time position with the company alongside other writing and editing projects. 'I enjoyed going out to lunch with my colleagues. I love my child but who doesn't want a little break? Going back to work? It was a relief.'

Joao Vale de Almeida mimicked a comment made by Boris Johnson, when he said he wanted to 'fix, not nix' the deal which was previously agreed on trade between Britain and Northern Ireland. The prime minister was speaking as the government announced plans to bring in a new law ripping up the protocol if Brussels refuses to re-negotiate the arrangement. But at a Westminster lunch, de Almeida said: 'It's not very reassuring if you go into a negotiation where you are presented with two options - either renegotiation or unilateral action to override the treaty. 'This is not the best way to fix, this is rather a way maybe to nix. 'So if we want to fix it, which is what we want and I understand this is what the Government wants as well, we need to create a better atmosphere.' The government - as well as Northern Ireland unionists - are unhappy that the protocol has led to customs checks taking place on goods travelling between Great Britain and the province. The row has created a political crisis at Stormont, where the DUP have refused to enter a power-sharing government with Sinn Fein unless the protocol is radically redrawn. Foreign secretary announced on Tuesday that she planned to bring forward legislation within weeks overwriting parts of the post-Brexit deal on Northern Ireland. De Almeida said there was no chance of the EU agreeing to change the 'mandate' it has agreed on how the protocol should be implemented. Instead, he insisted the only solution was for the UK to accept the proposed reforms proposed by Brussels. 'We were told that we should get a new mandate but I can tell you very clearly what the member states are telling us is very simple: You don't need a mandate and even if you ask for one, you will not get it,' he said. On suggestions that the EU could launch a trade war if the UK decides on unilateral action, de Almeida said: 'There is still potential in the proposals that we've made, we would like to focus on that instead of going unilateral. 'Unilateral calls for unilateral. Action calls for reaction. 'And is that what we want, an escalation around Northern Ireland at this present point in time? I don't think so.'", "8cea8c5db3fd2ecf3bbfff206c028af42ec7c84c269455744636e917": "Under-performing leaders of Labour-run councils could be sacked under new party reforms, HuffPost UK has learned. Party hit squads would be sent in to turn around failing Labour groups under the plans. The party's national executive committee has been asked to approve the shake-up amid concerns some local authorities are harming Labour's general election hopes by letting down voters. One party source said: 'We aren't a private members club any more - we are servants of the people.' Under the changes being proposed by Keir Starmer, so-called 'campaign improvement boards' will be sent in to local council Labour groups identified as under-performing. The boards, which will be made up senior party figures with local government experience, will draw up recommendations for improving performance which the Labour groups will then have six months to implement. If the Labour group leaders fail to hit the targets they have been set, party bosses could remove them from their posts. A party source said: 'All Labour council groups must be focused on delivering for voters in their communities, and demonstrating the benefit of Labour in power. 'With the next general election at most two years away, Keir and [Labour general secretary] David Evans are determined that high standards are met at every level of the party, in every region. 'Campaign improvement boards will draw upon the expertise of the best Labour campaigners and officials from across the country, and ensure those local groups that require support implement the changes that are needed to deliver for working people.' It is understood that Croydon Borough Council is one of the local authority Labour groups which have been indentified as under-performing by party bosses.

She would have turned 38 on Saturday. 'Please don't say Marnie lost her battle to cancer. It's simply not true,' her husband, Succession actor Zack Robidas, wrote, per Variety. 'I watched her kick cancer's ass everyday since diagnosis. She is incredible. We chose to attack her diagnosis with blind optimism. We only talked about the future and continued moving forward. I don't know if this was right but it's all we knew how to do.' On Mother's Day, Schulenburg posted a photo with her two-year-old daughter Coda and her mother. She lamented being a 'half-life version' of herself for her child, but felt optimistic about her survival prospects. 'My mother showed up 100% all day everyday for me growing up or at least it seemed that way. I want to give Coda the same but I must be kind to myself and remember that nothing is permanent,' Schulenburg wrote. Schulenburg, a native of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, who earned a theatre degree at DeSales University in Pennsylvania, had her first regular role on the soap opera 'As The World Turns' from very late 2006 to the show's cancellation in 2010, according to IMDB. She earned a Daytime Emmy nomination for the final season, which featured Alison getting engaged, Variety noted. She also appeared in nine episodes of the One Life to Live reboot in 2013. Her most recent recurring role was on Showtime's Kevin Bacon-starring crime drama City On The Hill airing this year.", "6124abdefed0cefcf781ecfa6bffa8b91cddc6ae4a282b8c849ec68e": "Some refugees fleeing Russia's invasion are being left homeless on the streets of Britain, a Ukrainian MP has warned. On Thursday new government figures revealed 53,800 Ukrainians have so far arrived in the UK. Some 20,800 have come under the family scheme and 33,000 people under the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme. The data shows 107,400 visas have been granted under both schemes, meaning just over half of those with visas granted have arrived. The Homes for Ukraine programme places Ukrainians in the homes of ordinary Brits who volunteer to look after them. Speaking at an event in Westminster via video link, Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko said Ukraine had 'a lot to be grateful for' to the UK. But she warned some people were being left 'homeless because they have been kicked out by the host'. 'OK, it's a normal people-to-people situation,' she said. 'They are all human. Circumstances change. Something went wrong in the relationship. 'But there must be some kind of a backup plan from the UK government. Where do these people go? 'The hosts are not obliged, they have no legal duty to keep the Ukrainian family, there is no responsibility if they kick them out. 'But at the end of the day we have Ukrainian families out on the street, what happens to them?' Richard Harrington, the minister in charge of the Ukraine refugee programme who was also speaking at the event, admitted there was a problem but said it was 'very few cases up to now'. Vasylenko also urged the British government to improve its communications with Ukrainians waiting for their Homes for Ukraine application to be accepted. 'Some people came back to me asking whether it was a real programme or whether it was a scam about which they heard on the internet,' she said. She said the average time it took for someone to get approved was 'two to three weeks', not the three days she had been promised by Priti Patel. Vasylenko added: 'Some people in these three weeks remain in peril, in cities which are under attack like Kharkiv. 'Some people never actually made it in the end to the UK because they got trapped in occupied cities like Kherson or like Mariupol.' 'The government of the UK is doing a lot but could also do a little bit more.'", "03ea5cda60df3238a14aa7b4ced26a5455c4d9be063e2be1ca6a210d": "Love Island season is quickly approaching and for the first time ever islanders will be wearing second-hand clothes, as eBay is now the show's first ever pre-loved fashion partner.  This season, islanders will wear second-hand clothes, with a shared wardrobe situated in the new villa for the first time ever. Viewers will watch contestants show off outfits that will reflect their personality whilst playing their part to extend the life cycle of clothes.  It marks a huge tone shift for the show, considering it previously partnered with I Saw It First and alumni have gone on to be brand ambassadors for the likes of Boohoo, Pretty Little Thing and Asos.  It matters, because Love Island is big business in the world of fashion. Online fashion sales grew by more than a tenth while the reality show ran last summer, research found. The collaboration comes as new research from eBay highlights that UK shoppers are becoming increasingly aware of fast fashion. A fifth (20%) of Brits say they buy more second-hand fashion compared to two years ago and on average, they reckon 16% of their wardrobes are made up of pre-loved clothes. Those aged 18 to 34 have the highest average percentage of second-hand clothes in their wardrobe (22%), nearly double that of over 55s (12%). In the last year, searches for 'pre-loved clothes' have increased significantly, with Gen Z in particular driving the trend, as 80% confirm that they have recently bought second-hand goods. Fashion on Love Island is a big part of the show, which is why fans often look to replicate the looks of their favourite islanders. Last year's winner Millie proved the biggest trendsetter, with her one shoulder marble dress inspiring a 127% rise in searches for 'marble dress' and her hot pink co-ord causing a 114% search spike.  Cassandra Dittmer who is a sustainable stylist, thinks eBay pairing up with Love Island is incredible. 'Any person or platform with influence who promotes shopping more responsibly is a positive move,' Dittmer says.  'Like it or not, Love Island sets trends and causes spikes in shopping after each episode. Setting a trend to get creative with second-hand shopping and encouraging shared wardrobes could be game-changing.' Dittmer believes it's really important for people to see second-hand fashion on TV. 'Seeing this message amplified on TV will highlight this shopping approach to the masses, and also show that buying sustainably doesn't need to blow the budget. Any age, any budget, any size, and any style can all get involved,' she says. She explains that 'the rise of fast (and ultra fast!) fashion in the past decade has flooded our wardrobes, charity shops and sadly landfills all over the world, it's time to tune in to second-hand shopping and move away from thinking of clothing as short-term disposable pieces'.  When asked if she thinks more people are becoming aware of the consequences of fast-fashion, Dittmer says: 'I think it's still hard for people to connect the climate crisis to the shirt on our back. 'But with more and more awareness, education, and huge platforms like Love Island making changes, I think it's only a matter of time before the demand for newness, no matter the cost on people and planet, will be a thing of the past.' Unsurprisingly, the Love Island execs and team at eBay are pretty pumped for the collab.  'We are thrilled to be pairing up with eBay this year as our pre-loved fashion partner. As a show we strive to be a more eco-friendly production with more focus on ways in which we can visibly show this on screen,' Mike Spencer, executive producer of Love Island said.  Jemma Tadd, head of fashion at eBay UK, added: 'We're so excited to partner with Love Island this year and put pre-loved fashion, centre stage.  'The impact of Love Island and its stars across the UK is undeniable and together we want to inspire the nation to choose pre-loved first when shopping - even if this means buying or selling one or two pre-loved items to start with, it's a step in the right direction.'

A new report from the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response, which is part of the World Health Organisation (WHO), casts a damning light on society's response to global disease - and claims it has not changed since Covid broke out in 2019. The panel, set up in July 2020, suggested last year political leadership, financing and surveillance systems needed to be improved. 'One year on and political focus to prepare for more waves is flagging,' the authors behind the report explained. 'Work has begun to prevent the next pandemic but at the current pace, the transformative change required will take years to complete.' What else can we do to prepare? The new findings from the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response found one of the primary obstacles was vaccine inequity. Covid jabs are not being shared around the world equally, and according to the panel, high-income countries can now vaccinate their entire populations twice over with the large supply. For comparison, less than 13% of those in low-income countries are considered fully vaccinated. Without vaccines, the virus will be able to evolve and form new, stronger variants. As the report explained: 'Variants may still emerge that our vaccines cannot manage. 'The more quickly we vaccinate now, the less likelihood there is of ever more variants emerging.' It also called for more therapeutic and diagnostic tests around the world, too. And it's not the first warning we've had The report is an eery echo of the Global Health Security Index's findings from 2021, where it claimed the world was still 'dangerously unprepared' for any future outbreaks.  It also claimed the world was no better prepared in 2021 than it was before Covid emerged, and said even the countries with the best resources to hand - such as the US - still had a shocking number of deaths from the virus. Only last week, former prime minister Gordon Brown (who is also a WHO ambassador on health finance) warned that 'we are sleepwalking into the next variant' and that the world had become 'complacent' about Covid. Will anything trigger change? US President Joe Biden did host a virtual Covid summit in May with other world leaders, meant to revive vaccinations and testing, although the States itself did not pledge any money towards the effort. In its report, the independent panel did acknowledge this - but warned: 'A 'charity' approach is not serving the interests of ending this pandemic or tackling future pandemic threats.' The WHO has also warned there's a $15 billion (PS12 billion) financing gap to get to where we need to be on Covid around the world.", "1d45ccca2bbd7f23505e5913b0cac6ac0c29d093c31dd32467f03257": "The Derry Girls finale delivered everything it needed to and them some, pairing the usual shenanigans with some top tier cameos, quintessential Aunt Sarah, and a bewitching futuristic gadget: the microwave.  But writer Lisa McGee wasn't afraid to get political, either, doing what she does best: telling the story of Northern Ireland's history with relatable people at the heart.  The hour-long special was set around the time of the Good Friday Agreement referendum in 1998, which happened to coincide with Orla's 18th birthday.  We watched as Michelle and Erin debated which way to vote (Michelle longed for her brother to be released from prison, Erin worried about the safety of a mass prisoner release), before Grandpa Joe urged the 'wains' to take a leap of faith for a brighter future: 'What if no one else has to die?' While a quick straw poll around the office reveals some did learn about the Troubles at school, a lot of us did not. And on Twitter, it seems others missed out on this pretty critical history lesson, too.  The final, poignant scene in Derry Girls has been praised for teaching the rest of the UK more about Northern Ireland's history in five minutes than their entire secondary school education.  Why is education about this period of (very recent) history so shocking? It could partly be down to caution - but that's no excuse.  A 2021 report found education about the Troubles isn't even up to scratch in Northern Ireland. The report, titled 'It didn't end in 1998: Examining the Impact of Conflict Legacy Across Generations', found education via school and home varied widely among those born after 1998.  'Children's opportunities to discuss and make sense of the Troubles are limited,' the report said, according to the BBC.   'The potential to glorify or romanticise the past was a key concern where children were not included in discussions about the impact of the Troubles/conflict in communities and families.    'Participants noted that selective or partial accounts may perpetuate sectarian views that can reinforce a divisive mind-set between communities across the generations.'   But following Brexit, it's vital we all get clued up on this stuff. The UK and the EU are once again at loggerheads over the Northern Ireland Protocol. Northern Ireland is technically the only place in the UK with a European border, thanks to its border with the Republic. But understandably, many want to honour the Good Friday Agreement and avoid putting a hard border between the two.  Following the finale, people on social media urged politicians to watch Derry Girls for a 'timely reminder' of their responsibly to act in the best interests of the people.  You'd really hope the people leading these talks already have an in-depth knowledge of Northern Ireland's history. But if Derry Girls can make the rest of wake up to own ignorance - and commit to learning more immediately - that's a pretty good legacy.  A cracker job, some might say.

Earlier this week, it was revealed the love story between Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton) and Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan) will take centre stage in its forthcoming series, instead of going with the continuity of the original Bridgerton novels. In a new interview with Variety, Jess has revealed why it is 'the perfect moment' for the couple to take the lead in the hit Netflix show.   'I really feel like it's Colin and Penelope's time. Because we've been watching both of these actors on our screens since season one, we've already invested in them a little bit. We know who they are as people,' she said. 'I feel like, especially in the last season, there are these moments of tension between them where it's like, Colin walks up to the line of almost realising that Penelope has feelings for him but doesn't quite get there. 'Instead of treading water on that dynamic, we wanted to push it into their season. It really felt like the perfect moment to tee it up.' The third book in the Bridgerton novel series by Julia Quinn focuses on Benedict Bridgerton's romance with Sophie Beckett, and while his story will now be told at a later date on TV, he will still be a 'vital' part of season three.  Jess continued: 'We already differ from the books a little bit because we're an ensemble show. The books really focus on one on one romantic pair at a time and maybe the siblings have a little cameo here and there but they don't have full stories. 'In that way, even though we're reversing the order of the books, I think all the people you would expect to see -- Benedict, who is book three, he will be a vital part of season three.' Colin and Penelope follow in the footsteps of Daphne Bridgerton and Simon Bassett (Phoebe Dynevor and Rege-Jean Page) who took the spotlight during the first run, followed by Anthony Bridgerton and Kate Sharma (Jonathan Bailey and Simone Ashley) in the second.   The third season of Bridgerton will also see one of the Bridgerton family getting a whole new face, as one of the characters has been recast with a new actor. Both seasons of Bridgerton are now available to watch on Netflix.

The Met confirmed this morning that they had now completed their investigation into lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street and Whitehall.  A total of 126 fixed penalty notices for breaches of Covid-19 regulations have been handed out relating to eight parties over a 10 month period in 2020 and 2021, the Met said. Asked if the PM had received any more FPNs, his spokesman said: 'No, and the Met has confirmed they are taking no further action with regard to the prime minister.' Carrie Johnson has also been informed that she will receive no more fines, the spokesman said. Cabinet Secretary Simon Case has not received any fixed penalty notices, he added. In a statement this morning, Helen Ball, Acting Deputy Commissioner of the Met, said: 'There is no doubt that the pandemic impacted all of us in so many ways and strong feelings and opinions have been expressed on this particular issue.

In its latest Twitter update, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) claimed that Moscow's centralised command is only going to come under more pressure as it tries to re-establish control behind the scenes. The MoD explained that Russia, 'has fired senior commanders who are considered to have performed poorly during the opening stages of its invasion of Ukraine'. Who has been fired? This includes Lieutenant General Serhiy Kisel who commanded the elite 1st Guards Tank Army has been suspended after he was unable to capture Ukraine's second-largest city Kharkiv. Ukrainian resistance 'appear to have won the battle of Kharkiv' according to the US think tank, Institute for the Study of War, after Russian units were unable to hold their lines around the city. Russia has been bombarding the city since the war began three months ago, but the troops were not able to even encircle Kharkiv and were subsequently expelled. The commander behind Russia's Black Sea Fleet, Vice Admiral Igor Osipov, is also likely to have been suspended after the cruiser Moskva sank in April. It was Russia's flagship Black Sea missile cruiser which was struck down by two Ukrainian missiles, a huge symbolic and military blow to the Kremlin at a time when it was already losing morale. The UK officials also think that Russian chief of the General Staff Valeriy Gerasimov is still in post, 'but it is unclear whether he retains the confidence of President Putin'. What does that mean for the war? Without a clear command system, the Russian forces - already said to be disorganised and lacking supplies - are unlikely to secure any victories in Ukraine any time soon. As the MoD summarised: 'A culture of cover-ups and scape-goating is probably prevalent within the Russian military and security system. 'Many officials involved in the invasion of Ukraine will likely be increasingly distracted by efforts to avoid personal culpability for Russia's operational set-backs. 'This will likely place further strain on Russia's centralised model of command and control, as officers increasingly seek to defer key decisions to their superiors.  'It will be difficult for Russia to regain the initiative under these conditions.' Russia was already struggling There seems to be a major problem with top military officials within the Russian forces right now. Ukraine's ministry of defence claimed earlier this month that US intelligence has helped it to find and kill 12 Russian generals since the war began. Neither Russia nor the States have confirmed this number, although the US's National Security Council later claimed that it was providing 'battlefield intelligence' to Ukraine, and did not have intent 'to kill Russian generals'. While the details of this claim remain unclear, this is just one of many signs that central control is falling apart in Russia.  President Vladimir Putin is also said to have taken over the day-to-day management of the war, despite such tasks typically falling to more junior commanders. 'We think Putin and Gerasimov are involved in tactical decision-making at a level we would normally expect to be taken by a colonel or a brigadier,' a Western military source said, according to the Guardian. Yohann Michel, defence and military research analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told the i newspaper: 'If you're trying to be both general and captain, you are usually doing neither and you are creating uncertainty at every level of the chain of command.' He added: 'The Russian armed forces don't need to have this level of micro-management from the top who have problems of their own.' Russia's war effort is going so badly even a retired colonel broke rank on state TV and admitted: 'Sometimes information is being spread about some sort of psychological breakdown in Ukraine's Armed Forces, suggesting some sort of a breakthrough is imminent.  'None of this has a basis in reality.'

One woman had her ovaries removed by mistake even though the plan was to conserve them. Whilst six patients had injections to the wrong eye. Some 407 'Never Events' - things so serious they should never happen - were recorded in the NHS in England from April 2021 until March 2022, figures examined by the PA news agency show. This is the equivalent of nearly eight every week and is an increase from the same period the year before, which had 364 in total. Overall, there were 98 cases of a foreign object being left inside a patient after a procedure. Vaginal swabs were left in patients 32 times and surgical swabs were left 21 times. Some of the other objects left inside patients included part of a pair of wire cutters, part of a scalpel blade, and the bolt from surgical forceps. On three separate occasions over the year, part of a drill bit was left inside a patient. Overall, there were 171 cases of wrong site surgery. The wrong hip implant was undergone 12 times, a wrong knee implant was done 11 times, and patients were connected to air instead of oxygen 13 times. The wrong blood was transfused for seven people and one patient had a procedure to their breast that they had not consented to. Never Events are defined by the NHS as 'serious, largely preventable patient safety incidents that should not occur if healthcare providers have implemented existing national guidance or safety recommendations'. These figures are provisional as a further 29 cases occurred that fall under the 'Serious Incidents' category that do not yet fit the definition of a Never Event, but are under local investigation. The data also showed that patients were administered an overdose of the immunosuppressant Methotrexate twice, and an overdose of insulin was administered 11 times. Additionally, the data highlights the difference in the reporting of errors between NHS trusts, with Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust reporting the highest number of 11 in total. Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust and Sandwell and West Birmingham University Hospitals NHS Trust both reported 10 in total, followed by Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, and Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, who all reported nine each. An NHS spokesperson said: 'While these events are extremely rare, and NHS staff are working hard to provide safe care to patients, it is important that events are reported and learned from so that they can be prevented in the future.' A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: 'Patient safety is a top priority for the Government and these unfortunate events - although very rare - can have a serious physical and psychological impact on patients.

This life-like organ, which even drools, is the (ahem) handiwork of one Tobias Bradford, a Swedish artist based in London. If you're wondering where this rather stimulating bit of art can be viewed, it's on display at the Design Museum in London, as part of its current exhibition on ASMR - or 'autonomous sensory meridian response' for the uninitiated (you only need go to YouTube to experience thousands of ASMR videos yourself). Despite Bradford's serious and important contribution to science and art with his new contraption, horny TikTokkers who have happened upon the tongue while visiting the show can only think of one thing. And they're probably not alone (I mean, there's spit involved and everything). Named Immeasurable Thirst/Thirst Feeling, the disturbingly realistic wet rubber tongue - which moves up and down through a robotic system created by Bradford - can be found towards the back of the museum. Just don't all try to take it home. TikTok creator Anushka Chadha first posted it to her channel after visiting the Design Museum with a friend. To a soundtrack of Slipping Through My Fingers from Mamma Mia, she wrote, mouth agape in the video: 'the girls were too stunned to speak'. But other viewers were not - commenting on their hundreds on how much they wouldn't mind a device of their own. 'Drop the link', one wrote, while someone else asked: 'Is this on Amazon?' Others joked: 'I must be broken because this gave me butterflies'. And one women inevitably retorted: 'Does this come with different speeds?' You might be wondering why the tongue was made and what it's doing at the Design Museum. Well, the exhibition - suitably entitled WEIRD SENSATION FEELS GOOD (and the largest on ASMR to date) - was put together in collaboration with the ArkDes centre in Stockholm, Sweden. The show's curators and featured artists want people to come and see the displays to experience their effect on the body and mind (just like ASMR). 'The world of ASMR is a community, a culture, and a creative field,' said the show's curator, James Taylor-Foster. 'In this sense, it's a real site of imagination within an emergent field that acknowledges the internet as a territory for design.' And Bradford's inspiration for developing the disembodied tongue? More existential than you might expect.  He wrote on his website: 'An object which appears to act on its own interest carries many suggestions regarding free will and the 'self' in a philosophical sense, and the friction between rational thought and one's emotional experience of the world can be intensified when in a situation with conflicting sensory information.' 'Similarly to how a word can become absurd when uttered repeatedly, an action or a moment which is stuck in a loop can reveal some of the strangeness of everyday life.' Deep.

'I think that the gay actors should be able to play the straight roles too. I think some straight guys played great gay roles.' The 62-year-old star, who first found fame playing a gay public school pupil in 1984 drama Another Country, has spoken out about gay rights and previously said he believed coming out harmed his Hollywood career. 'I think the question is more 'Why can't gay actors play straight roles?... We shouldn't be making rules about this,' he continued. 'Yes, of course, it's great for gay actors who've had quite a hard time, you know historically, to be playing more roles to be getting the game.' The My Best Friend's Wedding actor praised performances by Michael Douglas and Matt Damon in Behind The Candelabra and applauded Tom Hanks in Philadelphia.   He added: 'It's quite frustrating. I was frustrated, I remember going to see Colin Firth in the film by Tom Ford. I thought, 'Well, thanks, Colin, that's the end of my career'. Because you know, that role really should have been mine. So you know, there's a frustration about that, of course.' It's A Sin creator Russell T Davies has previously said he believes gay roles should be played by gay actors. The writer and showrunner, who also worked on Queer As Folk, Doctor Who and A Very English Scandal, said 'it's about authenticity' when discussing the ongoing debate. 'I'm not being woke about this... but I feel strongly that if I cast someone in a story, I am casting them to act as a lover, or an enemy, or someone on drugs or a criminal or a saint... they are not there to 'act gay' because 'acting gay' is a bunch of codes for a performance,' Russell told Radio Times. 'It's about authenticity, the taste of 2020. You wouldn't cast someone able-bodied and put them in a wheelchair, you wouldn't Black someone up. Authenticity is leading us to joyous places.' Last year, US actor Neil Patrick Harris, who starred in It's A Sin and came out publicly in 2006, was asked if he agreed with Russell's comments about only wanting to cast gay actors in gay roles. 'I'm not one to jump on to labelling,' he told The Times. 'As an actor you certainly hope you can be a visible option for all kinds of different roles. 'I played a character [in How I Met Your Mother] for nine years who was nothing like me,' he continued, noting that he believes it's important 'to hire the best actor' for the part. Speaking of his own desire to play both gay and straight roles in the future, he added, 'In our world that we live in, you can't really as a director demand that [an actor be gay or straight]. Who's to determine how gay someone is?'", "0aee314353fdf8331ef5848c4c5ac3f452e69e0f4282f05dc1e11c1c": "George W Bush made quite the blunder on Wednesday night during a speech when he confused the Iraq invasion with Ukraine. The former US president, who was in the White House between 2001 and 2009, ordered the invasion of Iraq almost 20 years ago. His administration justified the invasion by claiming there were weapons of mass destructions in the country, but inspectors from the UN later confirmed there was no evidence weapons of the kind existed prior to the invasion. Bush has been heavily criticised for it ever since. It was therefore a rather unfortunate slip of the tongue when Bush, discussing Russia's unprovoked attack on Ukraine, accidentally made a reference to Iraq. 'Russian elections are rigged,' Bush said in a clip which rapidly went viral. 'Political opponents are imprisoned or otherwise eliminated from participating in the electoral process. 'The result is an absent of checks and balances in Russia, and the decision of one man to launch a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion of Iraq. 'I mean, of Ukraine.' According to some viewers, he then muttered under his breath: 'Iraq, too.' Amid laughter from the audience, Bush resumed and made a reference to his age to explain his error: 'Anyway - 75...' And it wasn't long before the Twitter reactions started to roll in.", "c90d003901611dfdc0c75bd2e442f31443ec528fe1cdecb8a97dcb3c": "On May 14, an 18-year-old gunman entered a supermarket in a predominantly Black neighborhood in Buffalo, New York and fatally shot 10 people. The accused, Payton Gendron, livestreamed the attack on Twitch. Gendron is a self-described white supremacist who posted a 180-page manifesto online espousing racist conspiracy theories including the 'great replacement theory,' which maintains that people of color are working to replace white Americans through immigration, interracial marriage and eventually violence.  A preliminary investigation of Gendron's internet history found that he had viewed white supremacist and racist content and studied violent events like the 2019 mosque shootings in Christchurch, New Zealand.  This act of extremist violence from a teenager highlights a terrifying issue that impacts families and communities: the radicalization of young people online.  'The sad reality is that if teens are online, they are being exposed to white supremacist content,' Dana Coester, an associate professor at West Virginia University's Reed College of Media who has researched digital extremism, tells HuffPost. 'While there is a lot of public awareness in the aftermath of mass shootings of platforms such as 4chan, 8chan, Gab and others, this content is on popular platforms for youth and teens, such as Instagram, Tiktok, Steam, and Discord, and within games.' In her research, Coester has observed middle-school-age children consuming memes with a mix of 'shame-inducing violent, pornographic, gore, misogynistic, anti-Semitic, anti-Muslim and racist content.'  'This content is often portrayed as jokes, and is combined with benign and even wholesome content, which works to desensitise youth to traumatic content, and to create feelings of shame and isolation, which can make them more susceptible for manipulation,' she notes.  Coester's research has also shown that a teen does not have to be seeking out extremist content to encounter it.  'As a mom of teenage boys, I've noticed that they appear to be the target of campaigns to push their ideology further from inclusion and diversity,' says writer and media critic Joanna Schroeder. 'These campaigns come in forms that are quite formal, like YouTube ads and paid, sponsored content on social media, to more subtle propaganda like commentary by YouTubers and TikTok accounts the kids already follow and streamers who add commentary into their live video game play.' She notes that YouTube's algorithm and autoplay function have been found to push young people 'toward biased and politicised content, even when they start on innocuous gaming videos.' The isolation of the past two years has exacerbated the issue, as teens have increasingly turned to the internet for connection.  'Thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic, teens have been spending more and more time online than ever before,' says Brian Hughes, associate director of the Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab (PERIL) at American University. 'That time was often unsupervised, so they were more likely to encounter this kind of propaganda and recruitment - and when they encountered it, were more likely to not have someone on hand to say, 'Hey, hold on, this looks like it's trying to manipulate you.''  Although online radicalisation is a complex and systemic issue, there are steps parents and caregivers can take to help combat budding extremism. Below, experts share their advice for what to do if you suspect your teen is getting radicalised online. Pay attention to your teen's online consumption 'As a parent myself, I often tell my friends to listen in on what the kids are watching on YouTube, ask what the people they follow are talking about, and ask if they've learned anything online,' Schroeder says. 'Often, our kids will surprise us with wonderful things they've learned, but we may also discover that they've been fed misinformation or even disinformation and believe it simply because they've never heard anyone challenge it.' Pay attention if you noticed your child laughing at or sharing memes with politically charged messages or extremist tropes and vocabulary.  'It's very easy to accidentally encounter hateful messages online,' says Adrienne van der Valk, senior fellow at the community organising group Western States Center (WSC). 'Young people may not have the digital literacy skills to know what they're seeing and might be repeating those ideas.' She emphasised that hearing these messages repeated doesn't always mean your teen has fully absorbed or understood them, but it's a good opportunity to intervene and start a conversation about what they're consuming.  Take note of new joke patterns 'Kids that are watching a lot of 'edgy' streamers, YouTubers and other social media personalities might push the boundaries of propriety at home, consciously or subconsciously mimicking the tone of these 'edgelords,'' Schroeder says. Pay attention if your teen is sharing new jokes and memes that are out of character or outside the culture of humour in your family. Humour is often a tactic of extremist groups to cultivate a following. In 2017, a leaked style guide from the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer highlighted the white supremacist organisation's strategy: 'Packing our message inside of existing cultural memes and humour can be viewed as a delivery method. Something like adding cherry flavour to children's medicine.' While humour sometimes involves plausible deniability ('I was just kidding!'), try to disrupt the idea that jokes pushing racist and white supremacist ideologies don't have real-world consequences. Ask your teen how they think that joke would sound to a friend who belongs to the group referenced. 'As a mom, if I heard this, I would take the opportunity to talk to my kids about how humour can be edgy without hurting anyone else - and that saying 'it's just a joke' doesn't undo the harm done when a person or individuals who are targeted,' Schroeder says. 'Often, these 'just a joke' jokes are ways to normalise harmful ideologies.' Look out for behavioural changes 'Parents should be looking for their teens changing their individual behaviour, feeling disengaged, disinterested in activities they enjoyed before or expressing grievances or ideologies that are new to their conversations,' advises Amra Sabic-El-Rayess, an associate professor at Columbia University's Teachers College who researches radicalisation. 'Parents might also see this culminate into their teens potentially withdrawing completely from expressing their views or engaging within school, local community and even with their own family members.' She added that radicalisation might manifest as teens struggling in school, cutting ties with old friends, spending extra hours online and displaying anger toward adults and peers. Listen to the views they espouse 'While there isn't a 'profile' for these types of situations, there are signs that, when intercepted, can be the difference between them falling deeper into the ideology and bringing them back to a positive space,' says Kesa White, a program research assistant at PERIL. She noted that potential signs can include discussing extremist beliefs, frequenting websites affiliated with harmful rhetoric or even former acts of extremist violence, harming animals, or using racial slurs and other hateful language.  'A big red flag is expressing beliefs aligned with the idea of the 'great replacement' or 'white genocide,'' Hughes says. 'Certain conspiracy theories, talking points, memes and cultural icons are perennial red flags, so pay attention to what your teen is becoming interested in.' Don't ignore any rhetoric that blames or scapegoats groups to which your teen doesn't belong for events or political developments they don't support. Other red flags include expressing strong loyalty to a certain figure online, showing a stringent new interest in politics or specific political beliefs that seem out of left field, or supporting and spreading anti-democratic groups and conspiracy theories. Talk to other people in your teen's life 'To the extent someone is able, try to talk to others in the youth's life,' says David Jones, the manager of applied research at the Organization for the Prevention of Violence. 'A teacher, coach, student counsellor, etc. is a good idea as they may have also noticed changes in the youth's personality or may be able to explain the root of these sudden changes. Trying to build a supportive network around the youth where everyone is on the same page with trying to help is a really good starting place.' Ask other influential adults in your child's life - whether it's a coach, uncle, cousin or spiritual leader - if they've noticed anything concerning. 'You can ask them to pay extra attention to your teen and help increase their sense of connection and belonging,' van der Valk suggests. 'This can be tricky because you don't want your young person to think you're going behind their back. But it can be a strategy to discreetly ask, 'Can you check on them?'' Don't shame them 'As a parent, it can be hard not to be angry, disgusted or even triggered by your child showing signs of having been exposed to this type of content, but it's important to take a deep breath and to try to talk to your child with respect,' Shroeder says. As you process your feelings and think about what you might want to say, turn to online resources. In 2020, PERIL and the Southern Poverty Law Center teamed up to put together a free guide called Building Resilience & Confronting Risk: A Parents And Caregivers Guide to Online Radicalization. WSC also has a free resource for parents and caregivers called Confronting Conspiracy Theories and Organized Bigotry at Home. Then, when you address the issue with your teen, be mindful of your tone and general approach. 'If you see something that seems strange, ask about it,' Hughes advises. 'Don't come at it from a position of condemning, scolding or ridiculing. Those approaches tend to cause people, particularly teenagers, to dig in their heels, so it could backfire and make things worse.' Foster open dialogue 'One of the most important things that parents can do is just to be curious and foster an environment in your home where everyone feels safe engaging in open discussion - even, and perhaps especially - about controversial or very political topics,' Jones says. 'Ultimately, a youth sharing their exploration of a radical or potentially dangerous ideology with a parent or caregiver is an indication that they trust the person and are open to discussing the new ideas they're exploring.' He noted that this opening can form the basis of constructive conversations. So, when you're addressing your concerns about radicalisation, do what you can to keep this line of communication open.  When you see a meme or hear a piece of information that is troubling, use a neutral tone to ask things like: What does that mean? Where did it come from? Who shared it? Why do you think they wanted to share it? What do you think makes this funny? Who do you think would dislike it? Who do you think might be hurt by it? 'It's tempting to just shut it down and say, 'Well, we don't say that in this house,'' van der Valk says. 'But if a conversation is shut down harshly, it drastically diminishes the opportunity to maintain an influential connection with that young person.' Instead, she advises casting yourself as someone who will be consistently available to talk about beliefs. Of course, you don't have to agree or tell them that something offensive is OK.  'But this affords the best opportunity to help them see things as they are and to bring them back to your family's values when they later realise down the road that these groups or ideas didn't deliver what was promised or are proven to be false or misleading,' van der Valk explains.  Try to figure out the root cause Keeping the lines of communication open not only maintains your status as a person of trust, but it can also help you understand and tackle why your teen is wading into radicalisation.  'If you can approach all of it with calm, loving interest, you can try to identify the need your child has that is being fulfilled by these sources online,' Shroeder says. 'Do they believe they aren't being told the 'truth' from their parents, teachers and the media their parents consume? Are they feeling lonely and the community they've found online (even if harmful) makes them feel less alone?' She also noted that there can be a heroism aspect to their connection with extremist ideologies.  'I think there is a strong desire within teens, especially teen boys, to be heroes, and I think a lot of these anti-democracy propagandists feed into that,' Shroeder says. 'They make them feel like diversity and inclusion are harming people (often using kids and white women as examples of who is supposedly being harmed) and convince them that resisting efforts to make the world safer and more inclusive for all people is the heroic thing to do.' Build critical thinking skills. 'Most of the time, the kids I've seen pulled into these dangerous ways of thinking are bright and interested in the world, and they simply don't feel they have anyone to talk to about the world whom they trust,' Shroeder says. 'They haven't been given critical thinking skills or media analysis tools. We need to practice this stuff with our kids starting when they are small, but it's not too late with teens.' Teaching media literacy helps young people learn to assess sources, motivations and points of view. It's also important to expose your kids to diverse stories and perspectives throughout their lives. 'Discuss those stories with them so that your child can critically think and question what an extremist group might curate for them,' Sabic-El-Rayess recommended. 'For many it is transformative as they become self-aware and understand they can connect with someone different from them. It helps them act differently and approach others with curiosity not hate.' Equipping young people with critical thinking skills and experiences helps them become informed consumers as they inevitably face propaganda and misinformation.  'There are plenty of young people engaging with extremist-adjacent content who will never become violent, or who will engage and ultimately reject it or move on to help combat it,' Coester says. 'That's what we try and foster. Help young people understand how they're manipulated and move them toward peer-to-peer disruption of those paths.' Reach out for help 'When in doubt, reach out to a trusted mental health professional for help in talking calmly to your child about these issues,' Schroeder advises. Although mental health counsellors can be a good resource, keep in mind that they may not be trained to specifically deal with extremism.  'If someone in your life -- young or old -- starts to become intensely focused on an ideology or some form of conspiracy theory, and starts to reorder their life around this new belief system, severs social ties, and talks about violence being acceptable, it is worth considering reaching out some form of specialised support,' Jones advised.  There are many organisations and programs involved in de-radicalisation. Hughes recommended contacting Hope Not Hate and Parents for Peace for guidance if you think your teen is being radicalised.  'While PERIL advocates for noncarceral solutions, if someone suspects the teen is on the verge of violence or discusses 'hypothetical' violence, law enforcement should be contacted immediately,'' White adds.  Remember that radicalisation is a complex, systemic issue that can't be fully combated in isolation. It impacts communities, as well as individual families.  'Organise with other parents, teachers, faith leaders, health professionals and community members to combat this and to fully recognise it for the battle for a generation that it is,' Coester says.", "c96e7ce296fb061cd2be0d65f034c01698feb3ab2138d367d425f7fa": "Welcome to New York ... University's commencement speaker, Taylor Swift.  The 32-year-old singer-songwriter delivered a heartwarming speech for NYU's graduating classes during the 2022 ceremony on Wednesday, where she also received an honorary doctor of fine arts degree.  'Last time I was in a stadium this size, I was dancing in heels and wearing a glittery leotard. This outfit is much more comfortable,' she joked in her opening remarks while dressed in the school's violet graduation attire. 'I am 90% sure I am here because I have a song called 22.' Before she took the stage at Yankee Stadium, Taylor shared a peek of her preparation for the day on Instagram, writing alongside a video, 'Wearing a cap and gown for the very first time - see you soon NYU.' Given Taylor's breakout success as a teenager, she never went to college or completed high school in a traditional sense, as she was homeschooled for both her junior and senior years. In her speech, the chart-topping star expressed gratitude to the 'patchwork quilt of those who have loved us, those who have believed in our futures'. including her own family for their support and sacrifices over the years. Despite recognising that she is in no way 'qualified to tell you what to do,' the music superstar went on to offer the crowd various 'life hacks,' including some lessons from her ups and downs in the music industry. 'Learn to live alongside cringe. No matter how hard you try to avoid being cringe, you will look back on your life and cringe retrospectively,' she said before poking fun at how she 'dressed like a 1950s housewife' for the entirety of 2012. 'Cringe is unavoidable over a lifetime. Even the term 'cringe' might someday be deemed 'cringe.'' Taylor then encouraged the graduates to embrace, not avoid the obstacles that inevitably lie ahead, as she's found that 'mistakes led to the best things in my life'. 'Having journalists write in-depth, oftentimes critical, pieces about who they perceive me to be made me feel like I was living in some weird simulation, but it also made me look inward to learn about who I actually am,' she said. 'Having the world treat my love life like a spectator sport in which I lose every single game was not a great way to date in my teens and 20s, but it taught me to protect my private life fiercely.' Seemingly making reference to the backlash she received due to her years-long feud with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, she continued, 'Being publicly humiliated over and over again at a young age was excruciatingly painful, but it forced me to devalue the ridiculous notion of minute-by-minute, ever-fluctuating social relevance and likability. 'Getting cancelled on the internet and nearly losing my career gave me an excellent knowledge of all the types of wine.' Taylor concluded her speech by offering some final words of encouragement, while also joking about her honorary doctorate. 'We are led by our gut instincts, our intuition, our desires and fears, our scars and our dreams. And you will screw it up sometimes. So will I,' she said. 'And when I do, you will most likely read about it on the internet.  'As long as we are fortunate enough to be breathing, we will breathe in, breathe through, breathe deep, breathe out. And I'm a doctor now, so I know how breathing works.' Taylor's songwriting and evolution as an artist were the focus of a class that Rolling Stone reporter Brittany Spanos taught this year at NYU's Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music. In the press release announcing Taylor as the school's commencement speaker, the university hailed her as 'one of the most prolific and celebrated artists of her generation' and the only female artist in history to win the music industry's highest honour, the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, three times.'", "16bae72dadd8905a8c831c979085d4863d8b34671d20fd71e0f0787f": "Derry Girls aired its final episode on Wednesday night, and managed to pack in some seriously impressive cameos to mark the hit sitcom's last outing. While the season three finale aired earlier this week, Derry Girls' last ever episode was a stand-alone special set around the time of the Good Friday Agreement vote, which happened to coincide with Orla's 18th birthday. Towards the end of the show, viewers said an emotional goodbye to the cast as they were seen voting in favour of the agreement. Following his cameo earlier in the series, Liam Neeson's character was also seen casting his vote as he returned for a silent appearance that viewers on Twitter found particularly moving: Fans were then treated to an even more unexpected scene in the middle of the closing credits, featuring none other than Bill and Hillary Clinton's daughter Chelsea. As Derry Girls devotees might recall, the gang wrote to Chelsea during season two in a moment set during the Clintons' 1995 visit to Northern Ireland. While they never received a reply, a scene set in present-day New York showed the writer and global health advocate receiving a hand-written letter that was apparently 'intercepted while on its way to the White House in the 1990s' She then read out the note from the Derry Girls asking if she would like to 'hang out' with them when she arrives in Northern Ireland with her parents. 'If they're anything like our parents, well, you'll be bored out of your tree,' the note said. Speaking about her surprise appearance, Chelsea Clinton said: 'Thanks to Lisa McGee's incredible talent, and that of the wonderful cast and crew of Derry Girls, people around the world have been able to better understand and relate to a hugely significant and important period of history in Northern Ireland and for the world. 'Like many, I am a big fan of the series, and I was honoured to be able to appear in the very special final episode. I hope people enjoy watching it as much as I enjoyed being a part of it.' Suffice to say, Chelsea's appearance in the show left fans suitably stunned: Set in 1998 - in the week of the referendum on the Good Friday Agreement, which set out a peace accord for the troubled factions in Northern Ireland - the last episode of Derry Girls explored the real-life tensions of the time while offering light relief as Erin and Orla attempt to throw a joint 18th birthday party. The group also faced tension as Erin and Michelle have an argument about the peace agreement as Erin feels it is not right that paramilitary prisoners could be released as part of the conditions while Michelle reminds her that her brother is in jail for such a crime. As the episode drew to a close, Erin reflected on the importance of growing up and moving on. The message became particularly poignant for the end of the comedy series and the historical moment as she speaks over video footage of The Troubles and discussions had by key political characters. She said: 'It's good, it's exciting and maybe a wee bit scary too. There's a part of me that wishes that everything could just stay the same. That we could all just stay like this forever. There's a part of me that doesn't really want to grow up. I'm not sure if I'm ready for it. I'm not sure I'm ready for the world. But things can't stay the same and they shouldn't. 'No matter how scary it is, we have to move on. And we have to grow up because things might just change for the better. So we have to be brave. And if our dreams get broken along the way, we have to make new ones from the pieces.' The characters have their final moments together in the polling station as they vote in favour of the peace agreement. As they walk out together, a voiceover by a news presenter says 'Yes - 71.12%. A record-breaking turnout and an overwhelming majority. 'The people of Northern Ireland have spoken. The country has just taken its first step into the future.' Derry Girls is available to watch in full now on All 4.", "9fdf433660fe565d881d608a48c87deed8df8d175cbe03f03d1abe4c": "Covid concerns may have subsided and though they're far from gone, now another virus, Monkeypox, has been making headlines. Here's what you need to know. What is Monkeypox? Monkeypox is a rare viral infection that typically does not spread easily between humans. It's comparable to smallpox but milder, less infectious, and less deadly. Most people recover within a week and the virus disappears on its own, prompting no long-term health effects. However, a more severe illness can occur in a few people.  The virus usually spreads through close contact with an infected person, although there's a low risk of transmission among humans. The symptoms include:   Fever   Headache   Muscle aches   Backache   Swollen lymph nodes   Chills   Exhaustion.   A rash can start too, usually on the face at first before moving to other parts of the body including the genitals. This rash then goes through different changes and can transform to look like chickenpox or syphilis before scabbing. The scabs then fall off, although it can leave a scar behind. People without symptoms are not considered infectious. How many cases have there been? Three cases in London and another in north east of England have just been detected by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), bringing the total up to seven confirmed cases all diagnosed between May 6 and 15. Those needing urgent care were treated in specialist disease units in hospital, although they were all found to have the West African strain, which is much milder compared to the Central African. So, why are people concerned? These four new cases do not have known connections with the previous cases announced earlier in May, although investigations are underway to understand the links between them. All four individuals were infected in London. They also all self-identify as gay, bisexual or other men who have sex with men. There's currently no link to travel abroad to places where monkeypox is currently endemic, meaning the medical community is still uncertain where the individuals picked up the virus. Chief medical adviser for UKHSA, Dr Susan Hopkins, said that this is 'rare and unusual', and has prompted the health agency to look into monkeypox transmission in the community. 'We are particularly urging men who are gay and bisexual to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions and to contact a sexual health service without delay. 'We are contacting any potential close contacts of the cases to provide health information and advice,' she added. The UKHSA's director of clinical and emerging infections Dr Colin Brown also noted: 'While investigations remain ongoing to determine the source of infection, it is important to emphasise it does not spread easily between people and requires close personal contact with an infected symptomatic person. 'The overall risk to the general public remains very low.' How is it usually transmitted? The infection is usually picked up from infected animals in rainforests. Minor outbreaks usually occur in West and Central Africa, but transmission is low because it can only happen through direct contact with lesions or respiratory sections. Infectious disease epidemiologist Mateo Prochazka explained on Twitter just why the new findings were so surprising. He wrote: 'Close contact between two people (such as during sex) could also facilitate transmission - but this has never been described before.'  He continued: 'What is even more bizarre is finding cases that appear to have acquired the infection via sexual contact. This is a novel route of transmission that will have implications for outbreak response and control.' He also pointed out that work is ongoing, especially when it comes to protecting health workers, a sexual health service response and preventing an increase in stigma and inequalities. Is this the first time it's been identified in the UK? No - three people were diagnosed in September 2018 and an additional person was named in December 2019 after flying back from Nigeria.", "412eb485c0acd1d3fc6ce13860b6938bf7a68f23a82d393f13261bc4": "Boris Johnson has been blamed for enabling Westminster's sleaze culture following the arrest of a Tory MP on suspicion of rape. Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said the latest allegations were 'utterly shocking' and there are some MPs 'who are behaving outrageously' and 'need to punished'. The unnamed parliamentarian, who is in his 50s, was arrested on suspicion of rape and sexual assault on Tuesday evening. He has been asked to stay away from Westminster by the party as inquiries continue and has been released on bail. The Tories have so far decided not to remove the party whip, meaning he can still sit as a Tory MP. Davey said it 'shouldn't even be a question' that the whip is removed as he accused the Tories of 'dragging their feet when one of their own has broken the law'. He told Sky News: 'I believe in the process of law, but in the meantime during these investigations, these extremely serious allegations, of course the whip should be removed. 'I can't believe the Conservatives are yet again, dragging their feet when one of their own has broken the law.' Alluding to the partygate scandal that has engulfed Downing Street, he added\\; 'This is becoming a theme. And maybe it's because the prime minister breaks the law and lies about it and gets away with it. 'It's a prime minister who has created a culture, particularly in the Conservative Party, and this is setting a very bad example for the country, for our young people. 'And the prime minister, frankly -- you know I've called for him to resign -- but I don't believe he's a decent person. 'He's not a decent person to be the prime minister of our great country. And I think true patriots would want him to go. 'This whole culture, it rots from the top sometimes, a fish rots from his head, and if I think we got rid of the prime minister, it will be a big step forward to beginning to address some of these problems.' Scotland Yard said the man was detained on suspicion of rape and sexual assault offences spanning seven years. He has also been accused of indecent assault, abuse of a position of trust and misconduct in a public office. The Metropolitan Police said officers initially received a complaint about the MP in January 2020.  News of the arrest came just weeks after Neil Parish resigned as a Tory MP for watching porn in the Commons. Imrad Ahmad Khan also quit as the Conservative MP for Wakefield after being convicted of sexually assaulting a teenage boy. David Warburton, the MP for Somerton and Frome, was suspended over allegations of sexual harassment and drug use. And Rob Roberts, the MP for Delyn in North Wales, was also suspended by the Conservatives for sexually harassing a member of his staff.

After an argument, he packed his bags and left. 'We were both devastated as we still loved each other. He begged to come back for ages, but I held my ground and he respected my wishes,' she says. 'After a few weeks he came to pick up his belongings and we had a very emotional talk.' Louise noticed her ex had been self-harming since their break up. He's currently seeking counselling and believes he might have bipolar disorder. 'He misses me terribly, as I do him but I'm getting on with my life, meeting friends, doing things I enjoy and building my own self esteem back,' she says. 'He seems to be relying on me. 'My concern is I've given him false hope. I'm not saying getting back together is out of the question, but I'm nowhere close to that yet.' Louise's ex wants them to get back together, but she's unsure. How can she navigate the situation, while being sensitive to her ex's mental health needs? Clearly this is a hard situation to be in. Counselling Directory member Jo Kierstead tells Louise: 'I can sense the battle between your heart and your head. Your connection to your ex runs deep, you've shared history and invested time into this relationship and navigated an especially challenging chapter of life together, under the intensity of the pandemic.' Here's some advice for those facing a similar situation:  How can Louise navigate this situation whilst being sensitive to her ex's mental health needs?  'I would encourage Louise to reflect on where her own mental health is at. When our own mental health is under strain, it's hard to find clarity and we can make poor choices, so, if she can make herself a priority, it will serve her better in the longer-term,' Kierstead says.  'Her ex's self-harm is complicated, it's known to be an unhealthy coping technique for issues she alone can't fix for him. So while she may be tempted into 'saviour mode,' she has to be honest about what she can or can't offer her ex right not.' Kierstead explains that 'putting boundaries around what feels ok, and as importantly, what doesn't, will help her safeguard her own mental health'. 'For example, she may feel she wants to keep in communication with her ex to offer him support, but I would encourage her to be clear in her mind about why and how and in what capacity.' Kierstead says she could start with 'I am willing to offer you support but only as a friend and not in a romantic capacity.' 'And backing this up with tone of voice, content and frequency of future messages to ensure she cannot be misinterpreted or offer more support than feels ok to give.' How can we support a partner who has mental health issues? 'Mental ill health affects one in four of us, and living without help can put a huge strain on individuals and further erode our own mental health,' Kierstead shares. 'The best support is shared, I would encourage everyone, whether as the partner or as an individual, to broaden their own support systems by seeking out ways to avoid feeling isolated, overwhelmed or trapped in a downward spiral. 'There may be a support on a national level - try Mind - or it could be closer to home through a local initiative. The best way forward to is to explore what's out there, keep talking, keep lines of communication open with friends and family.'

It's a trope that endures when it comes to parental roles too, with the 'dead mum' conspicuous in her absence. And nothing has a chokehold on the missing mum than the high school teen drama. We've seen it in the 90s - Clueless, She's All That, 10 Things I Hate About You - to the noughties - A Walk to Remember, Save the Last Dance, Wild Child, Coyote Ugly - and beyond, with The Descendants, The Pretty One, Geek Charming, and more.  It still persists in the modern day high school film, think of the To All the Boys trilogy, The Kissing Booth, and even Netflix's latest teen flick, Senior Year (and for some reason, the greatest honour to the departed in many of these films is for their daughter to become prom queen?). This convenient story of the mum who died in childhood acts as a mere plot device to add emotional depth to the (oft female) main character, without needing much exposition. While teen films have a bit of an obsession with the absent/dead parent(s) in general - A Cinderella Story, The Edge of Seventeen, many Nicholas Sparks movies - the dead mum reins champion over its counterpart, the dead dad. Though the dad figure can can also be missing, the ambiguously absent dad is often explained away by lack of interest in their daughter's life, deadbeat tendencies, overworking, or through being unknown to their offspring.  A woman is either absent by wilful neglect (to which the story is pegged) or death. There is no nuance or in between.  Of course, dead parents aren't just used as a plot device in teen movies. This is, after all, the leading origin story for much of the superhero universe. But the deceased matriarch trope seems to be especially revered in films with a young female character who usually takes on mothering responsibilities as well as spousal, taking care of their widower dad's needs.  You might think it could just be reflective of the household set-up in the US, but actually, according to the US Census Bureau, 19.5 million children, more than one in four, live without a father in the home - so why do films insist on killing the mother? After all, we don't often see absent and dead dads in coming-of-age male-centred high school films.  The motherless teen narrative actually serves a purpose, one that can be considered anti-feminist, say Dr Melanie Kennedy, lecturer in media and communication from the University of Leicester, as it's once again about surreptitiously strengthening our perceptions of male characters; in this instance, the father.  She tells HuffPost: 'Typically those fathers are either stiflingly over-protective of their young daughters, or immature, irresponsible and who need to grow up themselves; or sometimes they are concerned for their daughter's wild-child ways and work to 'tame' her. In the end the father is valorised for his role in the lead girl's onscreen journey.' Though these male characters might get less screen time, ultimately their coverage is positive.  'These contemporary representations of single widowed fathers of daughters very much speak to this notion of the 'new man' who is capable of nurturing and care-giving, offering a more sensitive form of masculinity, following depictions of tough, muscular action heroes of earlier decades,' Dr Kennedy adds.  Let's not forget that these depictions are portrayed during a girl's formative years, a time where they may seek or receive guidance about what it is to be a woman, which in real life usually materialises from the women in our lives. But films show otherwise. 'This trope can work as a subtly anti-feminist ploy to remove mothers from narratives of parent-child representations altogether, in order to bring to the fore the father as the ideal guide and care-giver in young girls' lives onscreen,' says Dr Kennedy. 'This is a really insidious move to remove adult women from the picture altogether and make them redundant.' Not only do these plot lines come across as disingenuous to those who did lose their mums in childhood - and indeed many without a parent might appreciate films that represent their experiences - it also erases opportunities for women to play older parts. Professor Jo Littler, from the gender and sexualities research centre at City University London, tells HuffPost: 'A missing parent or parents has been a longstanding trope of children's books and films, both because it provides a dramatic space and push for the child to grow up, and because it's a popular fantasy to escape parental control. 'However an increase in absent mothers - rather than both parents - in film is troubling. It does reflect how contemporary culture can be uncomfortable with middle-aged women and indeed all grown up women to some extent.' It seems particularly maddening that mothers are erased in the coming-of-age genre, when many of the transitional moments we experience in real life are grounded by the connection we have with our mothers - especially for girls and young women.  And not only that, it's just lazy writing.  Thankfully, we're seeing better representations of motherhood - including the flawed, the flimsy, the chaotic, in film and TV - but it shouldn't mean it's available to view only in genres catered to mums and older women.  Girls, young women, and men, as viewers or as fictional characters should be privy to a multifaceted, autonomous mother figure. So, enough of the dead mum, and more of the powerhouse women we see every day in real life, please.", "fd6fcd7581e0c76727611bf40af07e21a076bcdc1015c0c5f38d128d": "We hope you love the products we recommend!

In fact, hospital admissions for eating disorders have risen significantly in the pandemic, jumping 84% in the past five years - with boys and young men increasingly affected. There were 11,049 more admissions for illnesses such as bulimia and anorexia between 2020 and 2021 than in 2015/16, reaching 24,268 admissions across England, new research found. Admissions in children and young people rose from 3,541 to 6,713, with a 35% increase in the last year alone, according to analysis by the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCP). And the rise in hospitalisation of boys and young men with eating disorders is stark, jumping from 280 hospital admissions in 2015/16 to 637 in 2020/2021. The RCP is now launching new guidelines to help health professionals identify people whose eating disorders have become life-threatening, so they can get the right care. Two high profile cases amplified the conversation on eating disorders in April 2021, following the death of Big Brother star Nikki Grahame and, in the same month, the daughter of Trevor Phillips' Sushila, who had anorexia for 22 years. Just a week before Grahame's death, mum Sue Grahame spoke of how lockdown restrictions - from social isolation to the closure of gyms - had impacted her daughter's mental health. Eating disorders charity Beat told HuffPost UK that it had seen a 302% rise in demand for helpline services since the first lockdown in March 2020.  Beat's director of external affairs, Tom Quinn, said at the time: 'We know the pandemic has been particularly difficult for people affected by eating disorders. 'It is not surprising, as those affected and their families have had to cope with extreme changes to their daily routines, support networks and care plans, all while also dealing with the additional stress the pandemic has brought.'  Quinn urged anyone worried about their health to contact their GP. However, the RCP is worried that vital signs somebody is dangerously ill from an eating disorder are being missed by some GP surgeries and in A&E due to a lack of guidance and training - which is why it has issued the new guidelines. Even when seriously unwell, people with eating disorders can appear to be healthy, returning normal blood tests.  For example, somebody with anorexia can have dangerously low levels of electrolytes like potassium that are not reflected in blood tests, while patients with bulimia can also have severe electrolyte disturbances and stomach problems, even when presenting with normal weight or being overweight. Dr Dasha Nicholls, who chaired the development of the new guidelines for eating disorders emergencies said there was a need for greater awareness of common symptoms among medical professionals and the public. 'Eating disorders such as anorexia, bulimia and binge eating don't discriminate, and can affect people of any age and gender,' she said. 'They are mental health disorders, not a 'lifestyle choice', and we shouldn't underestimate how serious they are.' One in five deaths of people with anorexia are due to suicide, while all eating disorders see high rates of self-harm and depression. However, the right support could lead to recovery in most cases, Dr Nicholls stressed. 'Even though anorexia nervosa is often referred to as the deadliest mental health condition, most deaths are preventable with early treatment and support. Full recovery is possible if spotted and treated early,' she said. 'If we are to stop the eating disorders epidemic in its tracks, it's vital that this guidance reaches healthcare professionals urgently and that government backs them with the necessary resources to implement them.' A spokesperson for the NHS confirmed that it was treating a third more children and young people for eating disorders than it had two years ago and agreed that professionals needed support to better understand and respond to signs someone was seriously ill. They added: 'Parents can also find information on potential symptoms, such as binge eating, feeling guilty after eating, negative self-image, and other signs of a potential eating disorder on the NHS website, and they should not hesitate to contact the NHS if they or their child need support.' Beat also welcomed the new guidance. Tom Quinn told PA: 'We sadly know from the results of past inquests that insufficient training and failure to follow the previous guidance led to preventable deaths, which cannot be allowed to happen again. 'Everyone with an eating disorder deserves safe and effective treatment, regardless of the healthcare setting or specialism of their care team.'

In a sign the Tory response to the cost of living crisis will be a bout of trickle-down economics, Sunak used a speech to the CBI on Wednesday evening to call on businesses to 'invest, train and innovate more' - and a tax cut awaits in the next budget to 'encourage you to do all those things'. Trickle-down proponents argue that reducing the burden on business allows them to power the economy forward, ultimately benefitting everyone.  Calls are mounting for Sunak to take urgent action on the cost-of-living crisis as official figures showed inflation soaring to a 40-year high. Charities, think tanks and opposition politicians said the government needs to do more for the poorest households, who are being hit the worst under the crisis. Speaking at the annual dinner of the business organisation, Sunak said he 'stands ready' to do more to help families cope with the impact of rising inflation, as he faces pressure to cut soaring energy bills with a windfall tax on oil and gas producers. He outlined a three-point plan to help with the cost of living, boost growth and invest to deliver long-term prosperity. The chancellor told businesses 'we are on your side' and called on them to help increase productivity and enterprise, adding: 'We need you to invest more, train more, and innovate more. 'In the autumn budget we will cut your taxes to encourage you to do all those things. That is the path to higher productivity, higher living standards, and a more prosperous and secure future. 'Our role in government is to cut costs for families. I cannot pretend this will be easy. The next few months will be tough, but where we can act, we will. 'We have provided PS22 billion of direct support, and we are going further. In October, we're cutting energy bills by a further PS200. 'In just a few weeks' time, the national insurance threshold will increase to PS12,500. 'That's a PS6 billion tax cut for working people, and of course as the situation evolves our response will evolve. 'I have always been clear, we stand ready to do more.'  Households are struggling under the weight of prices that are increasing faster than at any point in more than a generation, data showed on Wednesday. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said Consumer Prices Index inflation rose to 9% in the year to April, up from an already high 7% in March. It was the fastest measured rate since records began in 1989, and the ONS estimates it was the highest since 1982. A large portion of the rise was due to the price cap on energy bills, which was hiked by 54% for the average household at the start of April. Already ahead of the figures being released, surveys showed people were switching to cheaper alternatives and trying to control how much energy they use. Much of the jump is down to the high cost of energy on international markets, especially gas, although oil prices have also shot up. This has also pushed up the price of many other items, including food, which are made or transported using gas and oil-based products. The war in Ukraine has also hit global food supplies. Just getting around, including to work, has become more expensive for households too. Prices for both petrol and diesel are at record highs, although recently soaring prices for second-hand cars eased off slightly in April. Meanwhile, restaurant prices are also increasing, rising 1.8% in just a month. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the news is 'a huge worry for families already stretched'. She added: 'We can't wait any longer for action from this out-of-touch government. 'Today, Labour force a vote for an emergency budget and for a plan for growth.'

Some 15 of the 72 people who died in the blaze five years ago were disabled, and a recommendation from the public enquiry - published in October 2019 - called for the introduction of personal emergency evacuation plans (PEEPs) for people who would struggle to get out of a burning building. It said that 'the owner and manager of every high-rise residential building be required by law to prepare personal emergency evacuation plans (PEEPs) for all residents whose ability to self-evacuate may be compromised (such as persons with reduced mobility or cognition)'. But in a consultation document published on Wednesday, the Home Office said it believed the cost of adopting the PEEPs policy would not be 'proportionate' and that it would not be 'practical' or 'safe' to implement. On the issue of 'safety', the document added that attempts to evacuate the 'very mobility impaired' could 'slow the evacuation of other residents'. Instead, the Home Office said it plans to keep the controversial 'stay put' policy - meaning that residents of most buildings should wait for rescue services rather than leaving in the event of a fire. The department said the 'stay put' policy is in place for buildings which are 'designed to give appropriate protection' from fire so it is 'generally safer' for residents to wait for emergency services to rescue them. It said this knowledge, combined with safety reforms in the Building Safety Bill means 'it would not be proportionate to mandate' the inquiry's recommendation. The Home Office has said it has launched a new consultation, in response to the previous consultation on PEEPs, to arrange an 'alternative package of proposals to support the fire safety of residents whose ability to self-evacuate may be compromised'. A spokesperson said one proposal is for designated fire safety residents in the highest risk buildings, and for fire services to be provided with up-to-date information on where the most vulnerable residents live within buildings. But bereaved relatives of the Grenfell blaze have said they are 'enraged' by the government plans. Grenfell United, which represents people affected by the 2017 tragedy, described the response as 'a disgrace' for putting disabled people at risk. The group said: 'We are enraged at the government, whose sole focus continues to be profit and not public safety. 'We've fought for years to create a legacy for our 72 loved ones, and to prevent another Grenfell. 'But five years on, the government has reverted back to the same policy in place before Grenfell. 'This policy resulted in 41% of those living with disabilities dying at Grenfell. 'It left them with no personal evacuation plan and no means of escape. 'They didn't stand a chance. This report is a disgrace. 'Disabled people have the right to leave their homes safely. 'The government must implement the recommendation from the Phase 1 report of the Grenfell Inquiry and ensure personal evacuation plans for disabled residents.' London Fire Brigade commissioner Andy Roe described PEEPs as a 'key recommendation' from the inquiry and urged the government to prioritise it. He said: 'It's vitally important that people feel safe in their own homes and have certainty about how to leave their building in the event of a fire or other emergency. 'Personal Emergency Evacuation Plans (PEEPs) were a key recommendation from the Grenfell Tower Inquiry and we want to work with government, communities and other partners to make progress on evacuation plans.' The Home Office also said it will 'improve the professionalism of the fire and rescue service through modern workforce practices' and 'potentially' establish a College of Fire and Rescue. The inquiry published 46 recommendations in 2019, of which 21 have now been incorporated into law, according to the Home Office.", "f04ebe238d94322f31f61a6e2b6a72a46b532e2018f21c5fb053bdcd": " TW: this article contains reference to suicide and mental health issues. An MP has spoken out about her friend's suicide in the hope she can highlight failures in the system that prevent many people from getting the help they need.  Kerry McCarthy, the Labour MP for Bristol East, lost her friend Ric O'Shea after he took his own life in November last year. The pair met in the 1990s when they bonded over their love of music while based in Luton. But O'Shea, who had experienced mental health problems since he was young, began to suffer from psychotic episodes in his late 30s that would often result in him cutting off contact with his friends for days at a time. In the lead-up to his death, he contacted a crisis team which referred him to A&E. A few hours later, he walked out. Calls and texts from friends went unanswered. His body was then discovered by police in a welfare check at his home on November 6 last year. McCarthy hopes to raise further awareness of suicide with an event in parliament on Wednesday with New Order band members Bernard Sumner and Stephen Morris. They will be joined by Simon Gunning, the chief executive of mental health charity calm. New Order was formed by Morris, Sumner and Peter Hook after Ian Curtis, the lead singer in their previous band Joy Division, took his own life exactly 42 years ago aged just 23. McCarthy told HuffPost UK: 'When it first happened we were all pretty numb. 'I'd actually gone to see New Order at the O2 when I got the news, and I came out of that for some reason thinking this was just Ric going to ground again, he's going to be ok but that this time, we were going to sort him out -- we can't just let him be like this. 'And then I switched on my phone and saw the message from my friend saying that they'd found his body.' McCarthy describes her friend as 'thoughtful, smart and creative' but that he slowly began to lose touch with reality through the psychotic episodes he experienced. 'He didn't pretend he didn't have problems, but he was very against the establishment, which is something that developed because of his mental health,' she says. 'He got angrier and angrier with everyone he came into contact with and thought that nobody cared.' The latest statistics show that suicides rose to their highest-ever number since reporting began, with 4,820 suicides recorded in 2021, up from 4,475 the previous year. This increase could be attributed to deaths that occurred before 2021 but had their inquests delayed due to the Covid pandemic. McCarthy believes that gaps in the system meant O'Shea was failed when he reached out for help. 'I don't think A&E is an appropriate place to direct people in mental health crisis,' she says, suggesting they should instead be cared for separately with specialist trained staff. McCarthy also cites problems with a lack of local provision that force some mental health patients to seek treatment miles away from home, and long waiting lists. Instead she feels intervention could be made at much earlier stages, including by identifying indicators such as difficult and traumatic childhoods. 'I think even just a tiny little thing, like if there hadn't been a busy A&E, if they'd just seen him a bit more quickly, and maybe had him sectioned...I don't think there was an inevitability about it,' she says. 'I feel a lot of regret that we kind of accepted his condition -- we accepted it as part of who he was. 'I'm now trying to do a bit of justice to him.'

That's according to a new report on racial equality in education that has found six in 10 English state secondary schools have an all-white teaching staff, while nearly seven in 10 primary schools have only white teachers. Every ethnic group except for white teachers was found to be under-represented at all stages of the teaching career, apart from during teacher training. This is even though teaching hopefuls from Asian, Black and other ethnic backgrounds were over-represented in applications for training. 'There is no shortage of interest in joining the profession among these groups,' the report by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) said. Teachers from Black, Asian and other minority backgrounds are under-represented at every other stage of the profession from newly-qualified teacher (NQT) through to headteacher, compared to their representation in the general population in 2021, the report found. At senior leadership levels and headships the disparity is most pronounced with 96% of heads coming from white backgrounds, compared to 83% of the wider population. It notes that 86% of state schools have an all-white senior leadership team and 60% have an all-white teaching staff. 'Although secondary schools have a more diverse teaching staff than primary schools, children entering school today have a high probability of rarely or never being taught by a teacher from an Asian, Black, mixed or other ethnic minority group,' the report said. Michaela Lawson, who is the founder of Prosperity Project, an anti-racist training organisation for schools says if children of colour don't see themselves represented in schools they won't feel that it's a profession they can enter. 'Children can only be what they see,' she tells HuffPost UK. 'People of colour in schools tend to only be in the lowest paid positions, so teaching assistants, site staff and admin staff.' Lawson believes having more teachers of colour in schools is also important so that children feel comfortable reporting any incidents of racism that occur. 'Often, students don't feel comfortable going to white teachers, when they have those negative experiences,' she says. When Lawson was a primary school teacher, she says children would report these experiences to her because they knew she could empathise with them. 'When I was in school there was one child who I was having an intervention with,' she recalls. 'The first thing he said to me was. 'Miss, you have the same hair as me.' And this was a mixed race child who was going through an identity crisis. It shows that he felt like we had a shared experience.' A lack of teachers of colour can also feed into a lack of representation in the curriculum, Lawson says.  The NFER report also stressed there were 'significant disparities' in career progression for non-white teachers from one career stage to the next, with the most serious disparities seen in initial teacher training. According to its report, the rate of acceptance rates on to teacher training courses were nine points lower for applicants from mixed ethnic backgrounds, 13% lower for applicants from Asian backgrounds and 21% lower for applicants from Black and other ethnic backgrounds compared with acceptance rates for white applicants. Though there are more teachers from non-white backgrounds in London, the report also shows that 'the gaps between the rates of promotion to senior leadership of middle leaders from Black ethnic backgrounds and their white counterparts are significantly wider in London than they are nationally.' The report highlights this is 'particularly important' given demographic differences between the regions - 62% of teachers from Black ethnic backgrounds work in London. And it found that volunteer governors from white backgrounds were over-represented - a concern given their importance in decision-making in schools. While the NFER highlights the need for more teachers of colour at all levels in schools, Lawson is hesitant to urge more Black teachers into the profession, when many wouldn't be going into safe spaces. 'The culture of a school can be quite negative and that's actually why there's such high turnover. [Teachers] experience the micro-aggressions and racism that students do, too,' Lawson tells HuffPost UK.  'There's a lot of racial battle fatigue that isn't talked about, in terms of them coming across lots of issues in the school and, and no one is supporting them or understands them.'  She also stresses how many Black teachers are faced with the burden of leading diversity and inclusion initiatives. 'The onus shouldn't be on those teachers it should be on anyone who's willing to engage with,' she adds. 'And that's why in our organisation, we talk about racial literacy as more important. Even white students can be racially literate and want to engage in those conversations - and they can lead those initiatives,' Lawson says.", "354db7a71df4f159080abe5464cb9a994955ca817c62dffe8ac70b02": "One of the internet's favorite creatures could have never seen the light of day. Baby Yoda, whose real name is Grogu, came with an initial question mark for The Mandalorian executive producer Dave Filoni. He told Vanity Fair that the Disney+ series' crew was 'very cautious' at first about the decision to keep the character in the Star Wars series. 'Honestly, it's something I never would've done because Yoda is Yoda,' Dave said. 'I think people now look back and think it was like a slam dunk, but we were very cautious. The amount of measuring, especially in the first season, for how we were framing this kid took a lot of effort.' The character, introduced in 2019, has become a marketing success for the Star Wars franchise and its parent company Disney. Since his debut, Baby Yoda has become the subject of numerous internet memes, waffle makers and Chia Pets. He's also been parodied by comedian Kyle Mooney on Saturday Night Live and was a balloon in last year's Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Beyond the debate over Baby Yoda's inclusion in The Mandalorian, series creator and executive producer Jon Favreau showed 'off-putting' concepts of the character to the magazine. There were different looks for the character until 'one that finally clicked.' 'He had kind of a goofy, ugly look,' Favreau said. 'We didn't want him too cute.' The two producers aren't the only people to raise questions about the character. (Caution: Spoilers ahead.) Star Wars creator George Lucas was concerned about Baby Yoda's experience with 'training,' Variety reported. The Vanity Fair piece also teased a number of upcoming Star Wars projects. A third season of The Mandalorian is expected to air at the end of this year or in early 2023.    HuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page.

Only last month, inflation was confirmed to be at a 30-year high of 7%. In a matter of weeks, this has jumped to 9%, according to the Office for National Statistics. This has jumped to a staggering 10.9% for the UK's poorest households, who have to use a larger portion of their budget to pay for their energy bills. For context, the Bank of England has a mandate to keep inflation under 2%. But what do these numbers mean for you and your bank balance? Here's what high inflation rates actually mean Inflation is defined as the annual change in prices for a set of goods and services, a way of measuring how quickly prises are rising. When inflation rates goes up, it means the average cost of living rises - which makes sense as the current average inflation rate is 9%, and the UK is in a cost of living crisis. The current inflation rate means a PS1 coffee becomes PS1.09. You might also have heard of the famous Goldilocks and the Three Bears analogy to help you understand why inflation is important. If it's too low, economic growth is too 'cold' and won't grow. If it's too high, the economy's too 'hot' and growing too quickly. The ideal inflation rate is 'just right' - much like that third bowl of porridge - and is generally around 2%, give or take one percentage point. This is how the current inflation rate compares to previous peaks over the last 70 years. What has caused this? After subsequent Covid lockdowns, the economy has struggled to regain its footing all over the world - but that's not the only factor. Surging energy bills are the largest contributor to inflation right now, because of the knock-on effect of the Ukraine war and how this has caused wholesale oil and gas prices to rise over a supply shortage. Many of the supply problems stem from the West's sanctions against Russia. As a result,the UK's energy price cap was lifted. The average gas prices jumped by 53.5% and electricity prices by 95.5% in April. Fuel prices have surged, with average petrol reaching 161.8p per litre in April this year (the highest on record) compared to 125.5p in April 2021. The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, has also warned of an 'apocalyptic' rise in food prices. Shopping bills are already up 6.7% compared to last month. The costs of other items, such as raw materials, household goods, furniture, restaurants and hotels are going up too, as is the rate of VAT for some firms. Rates for air passenger duty and vehicle excise duty (commonly known as road tax) have been raised along with the cost of postage, water bills in England and Wales and interest rates for mortgage payments. So are we heading for a recession? A recession is when the economy shrinks for two consecutive quarters, signalling that people are, on the whole, spending much less.  The Bank of England has forecast 'very weak' quarterly growth in 2023 and a contraction as a whole next year. It also predicts GDP will fall by 0.25% and unemployment will pick up sharply.   'It is a very weak projection, a very sharp slowdown,' Bailey said earlier this month. 'There's a technical definition of a recession it doesn't meet - but to put that to one side - it is a very sharp slowdown in activity.'   As we move away from the inevitable economic dip, inflation is expected to gradually head back towards the 2% level set out by the Bank of England. But, that could be years away.  Here's what the government has said Prime minister Boris Johnson has suggested that he is considering additional help to ease the cost of living crisis, but more details on this support are yet to emerge. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has warned that he can't 'protect people completely' from the 'global challenges' of increasing prices, while Johnson promised to 'look at all the measures that we need' to help get people 'through to the other side'. The Treasury has already pledged to spend around PS22 billion to support the public, including PS9 billion for energy bills and to mitigate the impact of the National Insurance Contributions. Is it enough? There are still pleas for the government to do more right now rather than wait for the autumn budget. The British Chambers of Commerce also called for Sunak to reverse the rise in national insurance contributions and give businesses a VAT discount on their energy bills. Labour want a full emergency budget and the Lib Dems want an emergency VAT cut while charities told HuffPost UK all kinds of urgent action is needed. Opposition parties tried to push for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies, meaning any profits they had not anticipated as a result of the high global prices could be used to alleviate households. However, the Conservatives voted against this tax on Tuesday, with ministers arguing that it would deter investment from oil and gas giants.", "5d23ba8740a67aa96efb970ed4dd0bcf3be9bf892db1b5f64e626daf": "", "1f8a60b500fda59828619a0adb227469c584ecffef8ca1eedbdbc68d": "Pressure is mounting on the Conservatives to remove the whip from an MP accused of rape. The unnamed parliamentarian has been asked to stay away from Westminster by the party after he was arrested on suspicion of rape and sexual assault on Tuesday evening.  The MP, who is in his 50s, has been released on bail pending further inquiries. The Conservatives' decision not to remove the party whip at this stage means he can still sit as a Tory MP. But a spokesman for Labour leader Keir Starmer said: 'Given the nature of the allegations that there are, it doesn't seem to be sustainable to argue that he shouldn't be suspended from the whip.'  He added: 'It's a matter for the Conservative Party what they do, but our view is that given the nature of the allegations then the whip should be suspended and obviously at that point [his name] would become public.' Asked whether Starmer would suspend the whip if it was a Labour MP, the spokesman replied: 'Yes.' Scotland Yard said the man was detained on suspicion of rape and sexual assault offences spanning seven years. He has also been accused of indecent assault, abuse of a position of trust and misconduct in a public office. The Metropolitan Police said officers initially received a complaint about the MP in January 2020. A spokeswoman for the prime minister said he was 'shocked' to learn of the investigation when he was told about it yesterday. News of the arrest came just weeks after Neil Parish resigned as a Tory MP for watching porn in the Commons. Imrad Ahmad Khan also quit as the Conservative MP for Wakefield after being convicted of sexually assaulting a teenage boy. David Warburton, the MP for Somerton and Frome, was suspended over allegations of sexual harassment and drug use. And Rob Roberts, the MP for Delyn in North Wales, was also suspended by the Conservatives for sexually harassing a member of his staff. Johnson's spokeswoman said it was unacceptable that a 'small minority' of MPs' behaviour had fallen below what was expected. 'The vast majority of MPs behave with the respect and decency you would expect,' she said. 'Clearly, there have been a small minority who have not lived up to those expectations and that is not acceptable.' Asked why the whip had not yet been withdrawn from the accused MP, the spokeswoman said: 'While there is an ongoing investigation I hope you will understand that it wouldn't be appropriate for me to comment on that specific question. 'It's a matter for the whips.' It is understood the Conservatives will not make a decision on whether to suspend the whip until after the police investigation is concluded.", "511bdf85a85e7e12750571ae5ec44b3858194677e85a5ff0b728212d": "Earlier this month, Ncuti Gatwa sent the Doctor Who rumour mill into overdrive when he shared a cryptic photo of himself and Nicola Coughlan on his Instagram page. Just hours after he was announced to be taking over from Jodie Whittaker at the helm of the Tardis, Ncuti posted a picture of himself and Nicola holding hands on the red carpet at the TV Baftas. 'A pair of dolls,' he teased, leading many to suspect the Derry Girls and Bridgerton star could be about to become a new companion for the Time Lord when Doctor Who returns in 2023. However, it turns out fans may have been getting ahead of themselves. 'I am not going to be on Doctor Who,' she told Variety, although she did confirm that she and Ncuti were 'doing something together'. And while she offered no additional information, Nicola noted that Ncuti's involvement in the mystery project had already been confirmed, though hers had not. Interestingly, Ncuti was recently added to the cast of Greta Gerwig's Barbie film, which could potentially explain his 'pair of dolls' comment.

He signed off the message with a winking face emoji, sparking one social media user to comment: 'What a disgusting tweet.' Labour MP for Warrington North Charlotte Nichols hit back: 'One of the grimmest things about working in Westminster is not just the regularity with which allegations of rape and sexual assault come up, but the fact people like Fabricant here trivialise these as a laughing matter or quirky bit of gossip complete with emoji.'

The prime minister came under pressure from Keir Starmer during PMQs on Wednesday to introduce a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas companies in order to help the public pay for surging energy bills. Johnson left the door wide open to eventually U-turn on his opposition to the plan. But he said: 'This government is not in principle in favour of higher taxation. 'Nothing could be more transparent from this exchange than their lust to raise taxes.' The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the official independent body that examines the government's public finances, recently dismissed the government's claim it was cutting taxes. It said the overall tax burden would be the 'highest since the late 1940s under Clement Attlee's post-war government'. The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think-tank has also criticised chancellor Rishi Sunak for claiming to have cut taxes while actually allowing them to rise.   'He can now expect to raise more in tax as a share of national income by 2025 than he expected last October,' the IFS said. Among the tax changes introduced by the government was the rise in national insurance contributions that kicked in from April. Sunak has promised to cut the basic rate of income tax from 20p to 19p in the pound - but has yet to do so. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, said Labour would reverse the rise in national insurance if it won power. 'We are the only G7 economy that is increasing taxes for working people right into the middle of a cost of living crisis' 'We are the only G7 economy that is increasing taxes for working people right into the middle of a cost of living crisis,' she said.

The leader of the opposition was hitting out at the Tories after they voted Labour's motion for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies on Tuesday evening, when he unexpectedly targeted Rees-Mogg. Unpacking the large list of people who are in favour of the tax, he pointed out the chairs of Tesco, John Lewis, the education select committee and the old CEO of BP all back the tax. He added: 'Even the current BP boss says it wouldn't discourage investment.' Then came the unexpected attack, as Starmer said: 'And on the other side? The member for North East Somerset - when he's not sticking notes on people's desks like some overgrown prefect, he's dead set against it.' Rees-Mogg frustrated many civil servants currently working from home, when he left notes on their Whitehall desks which read: 'Sorry you were out when I visited. I look forward to seeing you in the office very soon.' The note prompted an outraged response on social media, adding to the flurry of headlines the controversial minister has triggered. Despite this burn, Rees-Mogg can be seen smiling along with the rest of the MPs on the front bench at Starmer's comment. Starmer then resumed his attack on the prime minister Boris Johnson, asking the Commons: 'When is he finally going to get a grip, stand up for the people of Britain and get on the right side of the argument?' Although the Conservatives voted against the windfall tax on Tuesday, commentators widely believe that the Treasury will bring in such a tax in the near future.

And although food prices have also been a casulty of the cost of living crisis, there are a few hacks you can try to reduce your spending just a little.  In his latest newsletter, money saving expert Martin Lewis recommends downloading supermarket apps from Sainsbury's, Lidl and Tesco, some of which offer shoppers discounts of around PS200 per year.  Here's what you need to know about the apps.  Sainsbury's SmartShop Nectar card holders can save big bucks by downloading the Sainsbury's SmartShop app, because according to Money Saving Expert, you can get up to 30% off items you frequently buy. Using the SmartShop app will automatically trigger deals on selected, regularly-bought branded and own-brand products.  The app is designed to be used while you scan as you shop in store. The app syncs with your Nectar account, so you'll also get your usual points and coupons. Sainsbury's estimates shoppers can save up to PS200 a year. If you don't have a smartphone or are low on battery, some stores have SmartShop scanners available, but these aren't available in all stores.  Lidl Plus  If Lidl is your go-to for the big shop, you're missing a trick by not downloading the Lidl Plus app. It contains coupons for selected products and also gives you cash back as you shop.  At the checkout, you can scan your virtual Lidl Plus card within the app. You'll receive a PS2 coupon if you spend PS100 in one calendar month. If you spend an additional PS100 (totalling PS200 for the month), you'll receive a PS10 coupon, bringing your total monthly savings to PS12. This soon adds up to a potential saving of PS144 per year.  You'll also get a free in-store bakery item coupon off your next shop when you spend PS50 in a month.  Coupons automatically appear in the app when you reach the amount required and must be spent in a Lidl store within seven days of appearing.  The app is also designed to help you track your food shop spending, with a handy section showing your recent virtual receipts.  (Something to note: Lidl Plus is sadly not available in Northern Ireland, but can be used across the rest of the UK.) Tesco Clubcard Pay+ (via Tesco Bank) If you shop at Tesco, you'll probably already know about standard Clubcards (if you don't, be sure to sign up ASAP, because there are hundreds of discounts - called 'Cubcard prices' - to be found on branded and own brand products).  As well as the instant discounts, a Tesco Clubcard collects Clubcard points. For every 150 points, you'll get PS1.50 in vouchers to use on groceries, days out and more. This is nothing new, but what you might not know is that there's now a way to make your Clubcard points go further.  Tesco has launched a scheme called Tesco Clubcard Pay+ - it's a prepaid debit card where you can keep funds to spend on your food shop and replaces the traditional Clubcard. You'll need to download the Tesco banking app to load it with funds.  According to Money Saving Expert, 'it gives the standard 1 Clubcard point per PS1 spent at Tesco (including petrol), yet currently points are doubled for the first 100 days for newbies. You also get 1 point per PS8 spent elsewhere.' Be sure to check the T&Cs of any deals and store cards before signing up to make sure they're right for you.

Now, even prime minister Boris Johnson has joined the debate, alleging people are more productive away from home, so it's clear the argument isn't going anywhere. But the cost of living crisis means many of us are watching our bank balances more than ever before. Inflation is now at a 40-year high of 9%, energy bills are soaring, and childcare costs are through the roof. So, if you're lucky enough to have a choice, what's the most economical option for you? Here's what you need to consider. What's the average? On average, it is cheaper for people to work from home. The cost of commuting along with the tendency to buy lunch outweighs the increased energy bills from working from home - or at least, that was the case prior to the cost of living crisis. Confused.com claimed in 2021 that the average commute by car for five days a week cost PS128 per month, by train PS328 per month, and PS76 per month if travelling by bus. The website's research also found the average worker spent an additional PS46 on other items while working, such as food or socialising, which they then didn't spend when at home. Confused.com concludes that many office workers saved potentially more than PS2,500 in the first nine months of the pandemic, when the UK was in lockdown. But, there are other factors you need to consider Transport Fuel costs were already the largest expense for most people travelling into the office prior to the pandemic. Now, petrol costs have soared even higher, as the fuel is in short supply due to the knock-on effect of the Ukraine war. Public transport also costs more now. Bus fares and the London Underground tickets have just been increased by the largest amount in a decade (nearly 5%) in a bid to recover from the pandemic. An additional 3.8% hike in rail fares was introduced in March as well. While cycling is an option for some - if you already have a bike - not everyone is able to do so due to the distance they may have to travel, or various health conditions. Meals Food is getting more expensive, too - but buying any meals out will still be pricier than rustling something up at home. The hospitality industry has had to trickle extra expenses from the cost of living crisis down to the consumer, meaning your usual Tesco meal deal has increased from PS3 to PS3.50 (without a clubcard). One worker told the BBC that they spent 'more than a quarter of what I make per day just to be able to go into the office' due to buying breakfast and lunch. But, you can still prepare your own food at home and then transport it into the office to cut down on costs. Company stipends Some companies have offered workers a stipend to encourage commuters into the office. Consultancy PwC is offering an additional PS1,000, while bank Goldman Sachs is offering free breakfast and lunch to some. This obviously could have a huge effect on how much you spend of your own personal money day-to-day when travelling to the office - but this is not exactly an option available to all workers. Firms are also keen to get workers back into the office because just one day of UK commuting is worth PS82 million to the economy, according to the BBC. Childcare Some people have attempted to both look after their children and work at the same time when operating from home, but this isn't really an option when you head into the office. The Centre for Policy Studies think tank recently revealed the UK pays the highest childcare costs in the developed world. On average, it costs PS138.40 per week for 25 hours of childcare for an infant under two. This part-time care will cost of an average of PS7,212 per year per child. Although the government is considering reducing how many members of staff are needed per child in cost-cutting measures, two-thirds of families are also paying more or the same for childcare as they do for rent or mortgage,  according to a survey of 27,000 parents. Energy bills The most worrying expense for many people looking to work from home now is the energy bill. Using computers, the heating, kitchen appliances and other electrical devices all adds up. Annual energy bills have risen by an average of PS700 per household - but for people who travelled to work via car or train, this is still significantly cheaper than commuting. So... should we work from home? The best thing to do is to calculate the costs of your average working day in the office, and compare it to the energy bill during your working day at home to figure out which is cheapest. While everyone is tightening their purse strings, it's also important to think about what matters to you (and probably what your boss says, too).", "64c9d01d4c506cf4a8cfb3eaaef4d84ab002f9cf06703e696d53ae74": "Fashion royalty Bob Mackie has an issue with Kim Kardashian wearing Marilyn Monroe's classic dress. After Kim graced the Met Gala red carpet wearing Marilyn's gown earlier this month, the internet had mixed reactions.  The dress was originally donned by the Hollywood icon when she sang her legendary breathy rendition of the 'Happy Birthday' song to then-president John F. Kennedy for his 45th birthday.  Mackie, the costume designer who sketched Marilyn's iconic dress just months before she died, knocked the reality TV star for rewearing the dazzling dress to the event, Entertainment Weekly reported. 'I thought it was a big mistake,' he revealed to the outlet.  In Mackie's opinion, no one should have ever worn the dress except the 'goddess' herself.  '[Marilyn] was a goddess. A crazy goddess, but a goddess. She was just fabulous. Nobody photographs like that. And it was done for her. It was designed for her,' he said. 'Nobody else should be seen in that dress.' The heavy criticism the former Keeping Up With The Kardashians star received wasn't the only difficult thing about sporting the outfit.  Kim said she had to lose 16 pounds in three weeks to squeeze into the garment because it wouldn't fully zip over her frame. 'I would wear a sauna suit twice a day, run on the treadmill, completely cut out all sugar and all carbs, and just eat the cleanest veggies and protein,' she told Vogue on the red carpet. 'I didn't starve myself, but I was so strict.' Despite her dieting and exercising, the dress only partially fastened causing her to rock a white, vintage fur coat that draped over the exposed zipper.  Kim marked only the second time in history that the famous garment was tried on, according to an Instagram post from Ripley's museum, which housed the dress. The fashionista worked alongside the museum to preserve the piece of pop culture by carefully transporting it with gloves and ensuring she only wore the dress for a limited period of time on the red carpet.  She didn't change into the dress until she was ready to stroll the red carpet, she said.  When Kim left her hotel on the day of the event, she wore just a fitting gown and changed into the dress in a small room at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. After the initial big reveal on the red carpet, she changed into a replica dress to protect the original. Even with Kim's extra measures to preserve the dress and the blonde bombshell's legacy, Mackie wasn't the only person to denounce her tribute.

So much so, that experts are now urging people buying dogs not to select the breed in a bid to put the brakes on demand.  Pugs have high health risks and can no longer be considered a 'typical dog from a health perspective', a new study suggests. Experts are advising people not to buy the dogs until there is an improvement in their health and their body shape shifts to being less extreme. New research from the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) has revealed the health of pugs in the UK is now substantially different and largely worse than other dogs. Pugs are almost twice as likely to experience one or more disorders annually compared with other dogs. According to the experts, these findings suggest the pug can no longer be considered a typical dog from a health perspective. Dr Dan O'Neill, associate professor in companion animal epidemiology at the RVC and lead author of the paper, said: 'Although hugely popular as pets, we now know that several severe health issues are linked to the extreme body shape of pugs that many humans find so cute. 'It is time now that we focus on the health of the dog rather than the whims of the owner when we are choosing what type of dog to own.' Between 2005 and 2017, there was a five five-fold increase in Kennel Club registrations of pugs. However, there are growing concerns over health issues of the dogs, stemming from the breed's flat face, bulging eyes, wrinkled skin and tendency towards obesity. These are the same characteristics that are often considered cute by the public, researchers suggest. But until now the full scale of the health crisis in pugs has not been fully understood. The study, led by the RVC's VetCompass programme, compared the health of random samples of 4,308 pugs and 21,835 non-pugs. Overall, pugs were found to be around 1.9 times as likely to have one or more disorders recorded in a single year compared to non-pugs, indicating a poor overall health status in the breed. Compiling a list of the 40 most common disorders across pug and non-pug groups of dogs, pugs had a higher risk of 23 out of the 40 (57.5%) disorders compared with a lower risk of only seven out of 40 (17.5%) disorders. Brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome (BOAS) was the disorder with the highest risk in pugs - the breed is almost 54 times more likely to have the condition. This reflects the common respiratory difficulties experienced by flat-faced (brachycephalic) breeds due to the shape of their faces.  Pugs were also at higher risk of many other conditions compared to non-pugs, including narrowed nostrils, skinfold infections and obesity.  But they did have reduced risk of some conditions, including heart murmur, aggression and wounds. The researchers suggest their findings indicate many pugs may suffer from seriously compromised health and welfare because of the extreme body shape that humans expect of the breed. To correct this, their body shape must shift towards a more moderate, and less extreme shape if health and welfare issues for pugs in the UK are to improve. While waiting for these changes, the advice from experts to the public is to stop and think before buying a flat-faced dog. Bill Lambert, health, welfare and breeder services executive at The Kennel Club, said: 'Sadly, certain exaggerations that can cause health issues are often perceived as 'cute' or 'normal' for the breed and, worryingly, desirable by pet owners too.' Justine Shotton, British Veterinary Association (BVA) president, added: 'These statistics are shocking but, sadly, they will not be surprising to our members. 'Vet teams see pugs with these distressing health problems - from breathing difficulties to eye ulcers and painful spine abnormalities - in veterinary practices across the UK on a daily basis. 'This study clearly demonstrates how it is the extreme characteristics many owners find so appealing, such as squashed faces, big eyes and curly tails, which are seriously compromising pugs' health and welfare and often result in a lifetime of suffering.'", "1e53f8449c8fdaa631d8c1de660fdc1585b28819f9c94c3dcce79a90": "Rejoice, for the sun is finally sunning. But with great sunshine comes the risk of great dehydration. If you've been sitting in the garden while working from home, sweating it out on your commute, sunbathing on your days off, or just bowling out and about during the warm weather, you're probably feeling a lot thirstier than usual.  As we all know, warm weather makes us sweat more, leaving us at risk of dehydrating as that water leaves our body. That means we need to drink up. While we're encouraged to drink at least a litre of water on an average day, how much should we be consuming when it's really hot out? How much water should you drink on a hot day? The NHS recommends drinking 1.2 litres of water per day (six to eight glasses), but some experts advise a much higher amount, suggesting we drink up to 3 litres - spaced throughout the day. Bhaskar Somani, a consultant urological surgeon at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, told the Yorkshire Evening Post the UK needs a 'radical culture change towards the consumption of water' if the country is to stay hydrated during a heatwave. As with anything, too much of a thing can be dangerous, including water. You shouldn't drink more than a litre of water within an hour, advises Medical News. Drinking too much in a short space of time can lead to water intoxication - or overhydration - when the normal balance of electrolytes in your body exceeds safe limits. This disturbs your brain functions and in rare cases can be fatal. So how do you drink the right amount of water for you? Firstly, identify when you're need ingto drink more. What are the the symptoms of dehydration? Signs you are dehydrated can include:   Headache   Feeling thirsty   Dark yellow and strong smelling urine   Feeling dizzy or lightheaded   Tiredness   Dry mouth, lips and eyes   Sweating less than usual   Urinating fewer than four times a day.   How can you lower your risk of dehydration? The NHS says you can reduce the risk of dehydration by:   Drinking fluids when you feel any dehydration symptoms   If you find it hard to drink because you feel sick or have been sick, start with small sips and then gradually drink more   Using a spoon to make it easier for your child to swallow the fluids   Drinking enough during the day so your pee is a pale clear colour   Drinking when there's a higher risk of dehydrating. For example, if you're vomiting, sweating or you have diarrhoea   For children, as well as giving them water, try hydrating foods and drinks that they'll also enjoy, including ice cream, yoghurts, lollies, and soups. Three easy hacks for staying hydrated Invest in a good water bottle  There's no shortage of snazzy water bottles about. You could pick a smart one that tracks how much water you've consumed or simply one that looks pretty and nice to hold. Sometimes the right kit does help. Embrace the power of electrolytes There's a reason sports people love them - the same reason your mum used to give you Lucozade after you'd had a stomach bug. Dehydration can cause electrolyte imbalance in your body - when the concentration of essential minerals your brain needs to function is out of whack with the amount of water in your body. Sip an electrolyte drink or try a rehydrating sachet or tablet like Phizz (which contains electrolytes and multivitamins) to get back to a balance.  Drink small sips, not big gulps  How can you consume more liquid in the day without needing to go to the loo every five minutes and losing it? Well, the secret might be in how you drink it. According to the experts, you should take small sips throughout the day rather than chugging it down in one go. So now you know, drink up.", "663200812bef6de62d7760707832f0536ecbc377e1964aa9a13e64ba": "James Corden has paid an emotional tribute to the prolific TV writer Kay Mellor, following her death at the age of 71.

Following the news, James paid a heartfelt tribute to one of the UK's most popular TV writers, hailing her for 'changing his life' by casting him in the TV show Fat Friends, which was one of his first on-screen roles. 'She was the most generous, kind and loving person. An exceptionally gifted writer,' he wrote on Instagram. 'She changed my life when she cast me in Fat Friends on ITV. She saw something in me that no one had before that point. She gave so many people their first chances. 'I have the fondest memories of being on set with her. She will be missed by so many. My thoughts are with her family and friends at this time.' The ITV sitcom also starred Ruth Jones, with whom James would go on to create the Bafta-winning sitcom Gavin & Stacey, which also featured Fat Friends alum Alison Steadman. On Tuesday, the BBC's chief content officer, Charlotte Moore, also paid tribute to Kay in a statement, saying: 'I'm shocked and deeply saddened to hear that Kay Mellor has suddenly passed away.

The film event is famous for a few things - huge films debuting over the course of the week, a seriously star-studded guest list and, of course, glamour from the A-listers in attendance. At the 2022 festival, films like Armageddon Time, Final Cut and Baz Lurhmann's long-awaited Elvis biopic will be debuting, so we can expect to see some of the biggest names in the industry turning out to watch.

The foreign secretary declined to say whether a Conservative MP should be effectively expelled from the party after he was arrested on suspicion of rape and sexual assault offences. The MP in his 50s, who has not been named, has been released on bail to a date in mid-June, pending further inquiries. Scotland Yard said the man was detained on suspicion of rape and sexual assault offences spanning seven years. He has also been accused of indecent assault, abuse of position of trust and misconduct in public office. Truss described the accusations as 'appalling' but repeatedly swerved questions over whether the individual should keep the whip. Sky News presenter Kay Burley asked: 'Do you feel that they should have been suspended or had the whip withdrawn? Of course we're innocent until proven guilty, but someone's been arrested for rape. Is it right that they still have the whip at this stage?' The cabinet minister replied: 'I think it's a matter for the police about whether that individual is named. 'I don't know who it is. I know that the police are looking at it and investigating it and I think we need to wait for the police to conduct those investigations. 'I understand that this individual is not on the parliamentary estate but I think we need to allow the police to take those investigations forward.' Burley pressed her: 'Understood, but you are content for them to keep the whip for now?' Truss replied: 'As I've said, I don't know who they are and I know the police are looking at this case on an urgent basis.' Pushed again by the presenter, Truss repeated that it was a 'matter for the police' before adding: 'If there was a disclosure about the name of this individual there could be an impact on the victim and that is a matter for the police.' Tory chief whip Chris Heaton-Harris has urged the MP to stay away from parliament but has not suspended the whip, meaning the suspect remains a member of the parliamentary party. It was understood the Conservatives will not make a decision on whether he has the whip suspended until after the police investigation is concluded. The Prospect union, which represents hundreds of staff working in the Houses of Parliament, said firmer action is needed. Deputy general secretary Garry Graham said: 'What will it take for parliament to finally take its responsibility to its staff and visitors seriously and suspend access to the estate for parliamentarians under investigation for sexual offences? 'Voluntary agreements to stay away do not work, as demonstrated by Imran Ahmad Khan's attendance at Westminster whilst investigations were ongoing, despite agreeing to stay away. 'Parliament has the same responsibilities towards its staff as any other workplace and it must live up to them.'  The Met Police said officers received a report in January 2020 relating to alleged sexual offences committed in London between 2002 and 2009. The investigation is ongoing, led by officers from the Met's central specialist crime team. The arrest comes amid renewed scrutiny of sleaze in Westminster following a string of cases. Former Conservative MP Imran Ahmad Khan quit the Commons earlier this month after being convicted of sexually assaulting a boy. David Warburton had the Conservative whip withdrawn after allegations of sexual harassment and cocaine use emerged. Neil Parish stood down as the Conservative MP for Tiverton and Honiton earlier this month after admitting watching pornography in the Commons. The latest arrest also follows a Conservative MP being arrested on suspicion of rape in 2020. He was never identified and police took no further action after an investigation. A statement from the Tory whips' office said: 'The chief whip has asked that the MP concerned does not attend the Parliamentary estate while an investigation is ongoing. 'Until the conclusion of the investigation we will not be commenting further.'

The ONS confirmed that inflation in the UK has hit a 40-year high on Wednesday, but as the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) claimed, for the poorest 10% of households, inflation is higher. At 10.9%, it's three percentage points higher than inflation rates for the richest decile. The researchers explained: 'Energy price rises are disproportionately hitting poorer households. The poorest households spend 11% of their total household budget on gas and electricity, compared to 4% for the richest households.' National energy prices increased by 70% in the year leading up to April, triggered by energy regulator Ofgem's decision to lift the cap on costs. The regulator has estimated that the average household will now be paying almost PS60 extra per month for gas and electricity, adding up to around PS700 per year. IFS also noted: 'State benefits only increased by 3.1% in April. This means big real terms cuts to the living standards of many of the poorest households.' 'Continuing pressures, such as the war in Ukraine, are likely to push Ofgem's October tariff cap, as well as other prices including food prices, even higher later this year,' the IFS's research economist Heidi Karjalainen said. 'We are likely to be in a prolonged period during which poorer households are facing rates of inflation even higher than the headline figures would suggest.' Earlier this week, Ofgem suggested implementing a new system where energy price hikes are reviewed every three months rather than every six. This did not go down well with the general public who are already struggling to pay the sky-rocketing bills. MoneySavingExpert.com's Martin Lewis revealed on Twitter that he 'lost his rag' during a meeting with Ofgem because its decision would have 'dire consequences' for consumers. While this is a global crisis, the UK is particularly struggling due to both economic Covid recovery and managing Brexit. Only a month ago, inflation was at a 30-year high when it was just 7%. The temporary VAT cut for the hospitality sector has been cut too, meaning tax on meals out and hotel stays climbed from a rate of 12.5% to 20% this month. For comparison, it was just 5% in April of last year. These findings from the IFS reveal for the first time a disparity in terms of inflation across all income groups. The number of people using food banks has subsequently risen too. According to The Guardian's Hilary Osborne, Citizens Advice has already referred more than 750 people a day so far, just in May. The government has been repeatedly accused of not doing enough to help in this emergency, with the Conservatives voting down a windfall tax on oil and gas companies on Tuesday evening.

Official figures showed the inflation rate increased to 9 per cent in the 12 months to April, up from 7 per cent in March. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the announcement would be 'a huge worry for families already stretched'. It means the cost of living in the UK has increased at its fastest rate since 1982 as soaring energy bills put millions of households under pressure. Reeves said: 'We can't wait any longer for action from this out of touch government. 'Today, Labour force a vote for an emergency budget and for a plan for growth. The Tories must back it.' The figures, revealed by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Wednesday morning, will add to pressure faced by households to cut back on bills and everyday spending.  A large portion of the rise was due to the price cap on energy bills, which was hiked by 54 per cent for the average household at the start of the month.   Higher fuel and food prices, driven by the Ukraine war, are also pushing the cost of living up, with inflation expected to continue to rise this year.   Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the Office for National Statistics, said: 'Inflation rose steeply in April, driven by the sharp climb in electricity and gas prices as the higher price cap came into effect. 'Around three-quarters of the increase in the annual rate this month came from utility bills.' Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that inflation was hitting countries around the world and pointed to energy prices as a main culprit. 'We cannot protect people completely from these global challenges but are providing significant support where we can, and stand ready to take further action,' he said.   Lib Dem leader Ed Davey called for an emergency VAT cut to 'slash prices' at the till and fuel pump. 'The warning lights are all flashing red and Boris Johnson hasn't a second to lose,' he added. Meanwhile, the British Chambers of Commerce warned that 'unprecedented' inflation could spark a recession later in the year.

Producer Jerry Bruckheimer, who's steered the franchise into a multibillion-dollar earner for Disney with Johnny Depp at the centre, recently addressed the controversial actor's future amid his ongoing $50 million defamation trial against ex-wife Amber Heard. When asked whether Depp might ever return to his role as the legendary swashbuckler in a recent interview with The Sunday Times, Bruckheimer said, Not at this point. The future is yet to be decided. Instead, Bruckheimer and company are in talks with Margot Robbie to star in a separate project based in the same universe with the producer teasing, 'We are developing two Pirates scripts -- one with her, one without.' Depp -- who starred as Sparrow in five Pirates of the Caribbean films, with the most recent instalment, Dead Men Tell No Tales, arriving in 2017 -- has said that Heard's allegations of abuse against him ruined his career. The Aquaman star has accused the actor of physically and sexually assaulting her on multiple occasions during their brief marriage, which she alluded to in a 2018 Washington Post op-ed that's now at the centre of the former couple's trial. Depp, meanwhile, has also claimed he was the victim of spousal abuse. Both have denied each other's claims. In court earlier this month, Depp testified that days after Heard published the piece Disney effectively 'cut ties' with him, per Variety. His agent also claimed in court that the actor lost out on a $22.5 million payday for a potential sixth instalment of the Pirates franchise.  But Depp has previously stated that he would never play Sparrow again.  In an exchange with the actor, Heard's attorney asked whether it was true that 'nothing on this earth would get you to go back and work' with Disney on a new film in the franchise, according to Variety.  'That is true,' Depp replied, seemingly putting the nail in the coffin for his future with the franchise. As for Robbie's Pirates film, the female-fronted project is reportedly a 'wholly original story with new characters,' according to The Hollywood Reporter.

Do you have atrocious balance? Your core might be to blame. So this week, we're delivering a five-minute workout that helps to improve both. The quick, equipment-free routine has been written by Fiona Hawker at Curves, a fitness community designed specifically for women. It'll help improve your balance, whether you're constantly wobbling during yoga classes or find it impossible to do a basic quad stretch on one leg.  'Balance exercises are especially important as you age because yourproprioception (your ability to know where you are in space) gets worse as you age,' says Hawker. 'Improving balance is also excellent for posture - it teaches you're the static and dynamic positions that are natural to your human form.' Add these moves to the end of your next workout or try them while you're waiting for the kettle to boil. They really are that simple.  1. Leg swing Stand with your feet together and your hands on your hips. Transfer your weight to your right leg and slowly swing your left leg out to the side as high as you can comfortable without leaning to the side. Maintain your balance by keeping your core tight, swing your leg back slowly and with control to cross slightly in front of your supporting leg and repeat. Keep your torso upright and facing forwards. This is a great exercise for the muscles in your inner and outer thighs, hamstrings, quadriceps, abdominals and hip flexors. Do this for 30 seconds then change legs and do the same on the other side. 2. Statue of liberty Start with your feet about hip width apart. Raise your left arm straight up and raise your left leg up to 90 then take your left foot down and crossed behind you dropping your knee to the floor and bringing your arm to your side. Perform this exercise slowly to focus on balance and keep your chest facing forwards. This is a great exercise for your abdominals, hip flexors, glutes, hamstrings and quadriceps. Do this for 30 seconds then change legs and do the same on the other side 3. Single leg rotation Stand on one leg with your hands on your hips and place the other foot against your knee or upper calf. Rotate your knee out to the side as far as you can without twisting the hips. Keep your hips and torso facing forwards then bring the knee back to the front. Perform this exercise slowly and with control. This is a great exercise for your abdominals, hip flexors and glutes. Do this for 30 seconds then change legs and do the same on the other side. 4. Standing side stretch Start with your feet together and cross one foot over in front of the other keeping the feet close together, flat on the floor and pointing forwards. Raise both arms straight up and bend to the same side as your front foot. Keep your core tight and your back aligned so that you are not leaning forwards or backwards. Look up slightly towards your hands. This is a great exercise for your trapezius, deltoids, rhomboids, triceps, obliques, abdominals and hip flexors. 5. Balance table Start on the floor with your hands stacked below your shoulders and your knees stacked below your hips. Extend your opposite arm and leg out until you form a straight line from your finger tips to your toes, hold for a couple of seconds then return to the start position and extend the other arm and leg out. Look at point on the floor between your hands. Keep your core in tight and be careful not to extend your leg out higher than your shoulder. This is great for your abdominals and lower back strength as well as improving flexibility in your shoulders, and hips. Do this exercise for 30 seconds. 6. Forearm plank Support your weight on your forearms with your elbows stacked under your shoulders and your legs extended out behind you on your toes. Keep your head in a neutral position so its not hanging down or raised above your shoulders. Pull your core in tight and keep your hips down so your abs are engaged but not sagging as this puts pressure on your lower back until you create a straight line from your head down to your heels. This is a great exercise for your abdominals, obliques, your back, shoulders, triceps, glutes and hamstrings. Hold this position for 30 seconds and don't forget to breathe!

Prison - for most offenders - is not a question of turning the lock and throwing away the key. Prison must be the key to starting a new life, and fundamental to this is education. Prisoners who participate in education while incarcerated are 7.5 percentage points less likely to reoffend than those who don't. And yet, as highlighted in the latest Report by the Commons Education Committee, which I chair, adult prison education today is in a chaotic state. Nearly two in three prisons showed poor quality management for education, skills and work in the most recent round of inspections. Of the 32 prisons visited, only nine were graded 'good', and zero 'outstanding'. This is not an environment in which we can expect prisoners to attain the skills and qualifications they need to re-emerge into the world as employable citizens. As our report reiterates, one of the core pathways to rehabilitation is employment. This is a no-brainer, and one I have campaigned hard for the government to recognise. In February, my amendment to the Skills & Post-16 Education Act, supported by my colleagues from both sides of the Commons, was accepted by the government, extending the apprenticeship scheme to prisoners. This is a vital step in allowing prisoners to climb the ladder of opportunity and develop the skills to find stable, rewarding employment once they are released. The government must now harness this shift by providing incentives for employers to hire former prisoners, in the form of tax breaks and allowing businesses to direct the Apprenticeship Levy to rehabilitation schemes. It is crucial that the reform does not lose momentum. Welcome as the amendment is, it must contend with a cultural undercurrent which has disincentivised learning within prisons for nearly a decade. The number of prisoners engaging with level 3 education (equivalent to AS-levels or above) has fallen off a cliff in recent years. Between 2010/11 and 2017/18, the decline was a shocking 90 per cent. What has happened? Our report identifies the lack of value placed on education within the prison system, and the lack of incentives for prisoners to engage with courses. At present, prison education is often paid at a lower rate than unskilled work. Prisoners must not lose out by choosing education. If they can demonstrate progress within their studies, education should be rewarded at the same rate as prison work. Another telling example of the low value placed on studies is the casual way in which progress is disregarded when prisoners are transferred between prisons, leading to fragmented or abandoned courses. Prisoners, ones initially engaged with their learning - naturally become disheartened as their progress is lost or delayed for months on end. My Committee has called on the government to address this by introducing digital learning passports which would accompany prisoners throughout their incarceration. Not only this, but the continuation of studies should play a key role in determining transfer. Completing or continuing learning must be a key factor in the decision made about transferring prisoners.  This is not the only area where a digital overhaul is sorely needed. One of the most shocking findings of our report is the failure of the system to assess the educational needs of prisoners from the off. While, since 2019, some screening has been in place to assess prisoners for learning needs, it does not go nearly far enough. The current estimate of 30 per cent for the number of prisoners with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) is likely to be far smaller than the true number. Moreover, our inquiry heard that there are only 25 qualified Special Education Needs Co-ordinators (SENCos) across all public prisons, equating to just one SENCo for every four prisons. And it is not only SEND prisoners that the current system is failing. Many prisoners without SEND, given the proper screening to address their needs, would benefit from attention to gaps in their education, be that numeracy or reading. The government must address this by introducing rigorous, formal assessment for every prisoner. It must also redesign its hopelessly outdated education data and case management platform, enabling the system to log multiple and complex needs. Prisons must be held accountable for preventing re-offending, and to do so must recognise the individual learning needs of those incarcerated. What is needed within our prisons is a root-and-branch culture change, one that reframes education and places it at the heart of the prison system. This is not just good for prisoners, but good for society as a whole because we know that if prisoners get the right education they need, reoffending will fall significantly.

The motion expressed regret at the omission of the policy from the government's priorities for the next parliamentary session. In the event, the government won the vote by 310 to 248, a majority of 62. The division list suggest not a single Conservative MP backed the policy. Ahead of the division, Conservative former minister Robert Halfon and Mel Stride, Tory chairman of the Treasury committee, both indicated support for the policy, with the former labelling oil company bosses 'the new oligarchs'. Shadow climate change and net zero secretary Ed Miliband said he would have 'no idea' how he would cope with soaring energy bills if he was on the basic level of Universal Credit. He added on the windfall tax: 'The truth is, they have run out of excuses, and amidst the chaos and confusion about what their position is, I think a massive U-turn is lumbering slowly over the hill. 'But I say this to the Chancellor: swallow your pride and get on with it.' Chancellor Rishi Sunak repeated his claim that 'no option is off the table', and that only if oil and gas giants do not invest their profits back into 'growth, job and energy security' could the policy could be introduced. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady, responding to the result, said: 'Conservative MPs have chosen to side with profiteering oil and gas companies over working people. 'Millions are being walloped by soaring bills and prices - having been left badly exposed to this crisis after more than a decade of standstill wages and cuts to social security, overseen by successive Tory governments. 'All the while the likes of Shell and BP are registering eye-watering profits.' Conservative MP Laura Trott argued windfall taxes would be discouraging competition. She explained that while BP and Shell could absorb a windfall tax, the problem would be with the 'smaller players'. Trott said: '(Mr Miliband) was absolutely right when he said that BP and Shell have not said that this is a disaster for them, but in many ways they wouldn't. They are huge players in this market. 'Actually, they can absorb a windfall tax. The problem will be much more with the smaller players, the discouragement to competition that this might result in. And I strongly believe that the best way we can drive down prices in this market is by encouraging competition.'", "b4c3d627ddb87906f3e59f8a35c1cf3ae390638dfae13cab5e394c11": "A Conservative MP has been urged to stay away from parliament after police revealed a politician had been arrested over rape and sexual assault offences over a seven-year period. The serving male MP, in his 50s, remained in custody as the Metropolitan Police questioned him over allegations of offences committed between 2002 and 2009, the Metropolitan Police said. The unnamed man was also arrested on allegations of abuse of position of trust and misconduct in a public office, according to Scotland Yard. Following the revelation, the Tory party confirmed a Conservative MP has been told not to turn up to the Commons amid the investigation. A Conservative whips office spokeswoman said: 'The chief whip has asked that the MP concerned does not attend the parliamentary estate while an investigation is ongoing. 'Until the conclusion of the investigation we will not be commenting further.' It was understood the Conservatives will not make a decision on whether the suspect has the whip suspended until after the police investigation is concluded. The Metropolitan Police said: 'In January 2020, the Met received a report relating to alleged sexual offences having been committed between 2002 and 2009. The offences are alleged to have occurred in London. 'An investigation is ongoing, led by officers from central specialist crime. 'A man, aged in his 50s, was arrested on suspicion of indecent assault, sexual assault, rape, abuse of position of trust and misconduct in public office. 'He remains in custody.'  It's the latest sexual misconduct accusation to rock Westminster. Imran Ahmad Khan quit as a Tory MP after last month being convicted of molesting a teenage boy. David Warburton had the Conservative whip withdrawn after allegations of sexual harassment and cocaine use emerged. Over the last year, about 15 MPs are expected to have been investigated by parliament's Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme watchdog that examines allegations of bullying, harassment or sexual misconduct.

The former Labour leader, now shadow climate and net zero secretary, dubbed Sunak the 'dude from Silicon Valley' as he mocked the Conservative minister's reluctance to increase benefits (the chancellor blamed computers). In the House of Commons on Tuesday, Miliband condemned Sunak over his refusal to impose a windfall tax on oil and gas giants amid the cost of living crisis, and that his reputation has 'crashed like cryptocurrency'. Sunak was seen as the likely successor to Boris Johnson but his reputation has been tarnished by a partygate fine, his wife's non-dom status and revelations he held a US green card of permanent residency while in government.  Miliband said:   'Who does he blame for the massive cut to benefits? He blames the IT system. The dude from Silicon Valley. Madam Deputy Speaker, who is he trying to kid?   'If he had got its act together early enough, of course. he could have raised benefits properly. Indeed, he found it perfectly possible to cut Universal Credit by PS20 in the middle of the year in September.   'It is not a case of computer says no, it is a case of chancellor says no.   'It's not the case of a computer system not being up to it, it's the chancellor not being up to it.   'The story of the last few months, crypto has crashed and so has the chancellor. And how similar they are. The chancellor and cryptocurrency. They came out of nowhere, the value surged, looked like the future.   'But it has all turned out to be one giant Ponzi scheme.'  'He's been found out, he's been rumbled,' added Miliband. 'Let's face it, his colleagues all know it. He's out of touch with what is happening in the country, and he's out of his depth when it comes to the challenges this country faces.' Sunak told MPs he will act to cut costs for people but did not say when this will happen. Sunak said history shows an 'unconstrained fiscal stimulus' at such a time risks 'making the problem worse', adding: 'Prices pushed up still further, expectations of higher inflation becoming ingrained, a vicious cycle leading inexorably to even higher interests and more pain for tens of millions of mortgage holders and small businesses. 'Make no mistake, simply trying to borrow and spend our way out of this situation is the wrong approach and those paying the highest price would be the poorest in our society. 'Instead, on this side of the House we're taking a careful, deliberate approach. We will act to cut costs for those people without making the situation worse, we will continue to back people who work hard - as we always have - and we will do more to support the most vulnerable.'

Harry Styles' fans couldn't quite put their finger on what accent he was speaking in as he sat down for a new interview with Zane Lowe for Apple Music 1 this week.  Harry, who was born in Worcestershire before moving to Cheshire at a young age, was heard discussing a variety of topics in the interview, including his much-anticipated third album Harry's House, as well as his relationship with his One Direction bandmates.  Zane also shared a clip of the interview on social media, in which Harry was asked about his pace of life, which quickly got fans talking.

The presenter signed off from the programme after six years on Tuesday, following the news he is set to join Channel 5.  At the end of his final episode, which also featured a surprise return from his former co-host Louise Minchin, Dan praised the BBC endeavouring to 'make sure everything we do and say is fair and accurate'.  In a two-minute thank-you speech, he began by saying: 'I've had so many incredible memories of working on this programme and wonderful moments in this role as given me. 'We all know there aren't many jobs where you're given the chance to give a voice to people who don't have a voice and to tell other people's stories, and I think that's what we love doing more than anything else. 'And it's been a real privilege to sit here and to present this programme, which we all know means an awful lot to so many people who watch.' Dan then went on to thank BBC Breakfast viewers, as well as the on-air and behind-the-scenes teams on the show, calling them 'genuinely some of the best people that I've ever worked with in my career'. He continued: 'To be serious for a minute, I think at a time when trust and truth have never been more important, it's great to work with a team - and I know that I see this every single day - that do everything to make sure everything we do and say is fair and accurate, and that is so important. 'I've no idea who is going to sit here in the future and who this job is going to go to, but I hope that they care about the programme, and I hope they care about the people they work with and care about the viewers as well.'

The Queen has been gradually winding down her public appearances and, for the first time in decades, let her son and heir Prince Charles read the Queen's Speech for the State Opening of Parliament last week. Buckingham Palace stated the monarch was experiencing episodic mobility problems which prevented her from attending the formal event last Tuesday. A few days later, the problem seemed to have subsided as she was seen attending the Royal Windsor Horse Show for Platinum Jubilee. Of course, Twitter couldn't resist joking about her reappearance: The Queen has not missed a single one of these annual horse shows since they began in 1943 - and it helps that it is held just 300 metres from her home in Windsor Castle. This year's particularly spectacular show on Sunday included an extra equestrian display called A Gallop through History featuring horses from around the world. The Queen is known to be particularly passionate about horses and was pictured with two of her fell ponies to honour her 96th birthday in April. While her appearance at the big event alone was enough to delight her fans - she received a standing ovation when she turned up - she also handled praise from broadcaster Alan Titchmarsh with admirable nonchalance. He told the crowds: 'For over 70 years, there has been a constant heartbeat in this nation. And that heartbeat belongs to the Queen.' The camera then panned to the Queen, who shrugged and pulled a face while people around her applauded. She also looked like she was 'having a ball' throughout the special occasion according to royal journalists. She even lifted her arm and waved in a comical response to Omid Djalili's joke after he said: 'Thank you for choosing us over the Opening of Parliament.' The Queen reportedly stayed until the event finished at 10.30pm, even though provisions had been made for her to finish early. Then, she made a surprise appearance in London on Tuesday to mark the opening of the Elizabeth Line. Her youngest son, Prince Edward, had been expected to attend the event solo. She learnt how to top up an Oyster card (making her the first person to use one of the highly anticipated new tube line) while dressed in a bright yellow to honour the station named after her, and was clearly delighted to be there. Royal commentator Omid Scobie pointed out the Queen's happiness at these more lighthearted events, he said: 'The Queen has earned every right to conserve her energy for celebratory moments that the nation can enjoy alongside her.'", "9f0be0335322828adde25fece7229cc11791b43fa3fd03a25d1d335d": "Foreign secretary Liz Truss today unveiled the government's long-awaited plans for redrawing the Northern Ireland protocol. The post-Brexit agreement on trade between the province and Great Britain has been widely criticised by ministers and unionist politicians. Despite her bellicose language last week, Truss was far more conciliatory as she called on the EU to agree to renegotiate the terms of the deal. But she warned that if Brussels refuses to budge, legislation allowing the UK government to unilaterally over-ride the protocol will be introduced 'within weeks'. So what does the government plan to do and what does it mean?  Why does the government want to change the protocol? Despite Boris Johnson's previous claims to the contrary, the protocol has resulted in a customs border in the Irish Sea, increasing red tape for businesses trying to sell their goods. This has also angered unionist politicians, who see it as driving a wedge between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Following the Stormont elections earlier this month, the DUP has refused to form a power-sharing executive with Sinn Fein - who emerged as the largest party - unless the protocol is redrawn. The government has therefore called on the EU to drop its opposition to renegotiating the deal, claiming that failure to do so will put the 1998 Good Friday Agreement at risk. What has Liz Truss announced? In a statement to MPs, the foreign secretary said that while 'our preference remains a negotiated solution with the EU', the government had drawn up legislation to unilaterally over-ride the protocol if no agreement is possible. She said the legislation will propose separate 'green' and 'red' lanes for goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, with those destined to stay within the UK freed from EU-level checks. The cabinet minister said it would also allow the government to apply VAT on all goods at the same rate in Northern Ireland as it does in the rest of the UK, something the protocol currently prevents. Truss said: 'The bill will contain an explicit power to give effect to a new, revised protocol if we can reach an accommodation that meets our goal of protecting the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement. We remain open to a negotiated solution, but the urgency of the situation means we can't afford to delay any longer. How has the EU responded? They're not very impressed. Maros Sefcovic, the European Commission vice-president who has been negotiating with Truss, issued a lengthy statement shortly after the foreign secretary's statement. In it, he expressed concern at the UK's willingness to act unilaterally, and threatening to 'respond with all measures at its disposal' - Brussels-speak for a trade war.  A trade war could see punishing tariffs being slapped on British goods being sold to the EU, harming UK businesses and driving up prices in the shops. Sefcovic said: 'With political will and commitment, practical issues arising from the implementation of the protocol in Northern Ireland can be resolved.  'The European Commission stands ready to continue playing its part, as it has from the outset.'   What about the Northern Ireland parties? It's safe to say the jury is still out. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson described the announcement of legislation as a 'welcome but overdue step' and said his party will take a 'graduated and cautious' approach to re-entering government at Stormont. Michelle O'Neill, Sinn Fein's vice-president and the woman set to be Northern Ireland's next first minister if power-sharing is restored, Northern Ireland must not be caught in the middle of 'a game of chicken' between London and Brussels. She said: 'The behaviour of the British government and Boris Johnson in terms of initiating again legislation to override an international agreement does not bode well for a good faith negotiation and I think that puts us in jeopardy in terms of the uncertainty and instability that it provides for us here.' Colum Eastwood, leader of the nationalist SDLP, said the foreign secretary was 'going to against the majority' of citizens in Northern Ireland, who he said support the protocol. What happens next? More talks. A damaging trade war in the middle of a cost of living crisis is the last thing the UK needs, so it's in the government's best interests to reach an agreement with the EU. At the same time, the prime minister is desperate for power-sharing to be restored at Stormont. 'I think everybody should be rolling up their sleeves and get stuck in to the government of Northern Ireland,' Johnson said on a visit to Belfast yesterday. 'The province has got so much going for it but you need leadership and you need government.  'So you bet I said to the DUP in particular 'we want to see you back in the executive, we want to see you nominating, we want to see a speaker in the assembly', of course.   'The issue they have is that they object to the operation of the protocol. We don't want to scrap it, but we think it can be fixed.'

It comes as people from the island are asking potential visitors not visit, due to overtourism. Last year, the island struggled to cope with high levels of tourism demands as tens of thousands of extra US tourists left Hawaii in turmoil. US travellers who were fully vaccinated were allowed to visit the island and skip quarantine and pre-flight testing last year. This, however, led to several complications across the Hawaiian islands, such as shortages of hospitality workers, congested roads and 90-minute restaurant times.  Local residents also reported water shortages, with some pointing to the longer term consequences of overtourism, including the displacement of natives to prioritise tourist attractions and the ruining of sacred sites. A petition calling for an end to overtourism has gained almost 2,000 signatures.  While the Hawaiian tourism board has not banned tourists, is has posted guides for those visiting on how to minimise their impact on the island. But on TikTok, some Hawaiians are urging tourists to stay away altogether.  However, Benefit Cosmetics recently took a group of influencers to the island despite the calls not to. On Instagram, the brand shared a post telling followers: 'The Benebabes have landed in Hawaii' - though it's yet to post any images or videos from the trip. Benefit has long used Hawaiian culture within its marketing strategy. YouTube videos show the brand hosting influencers in Hawaii as far back as 2016. And though the brand has toned down its use of hula girls and lei garlands on products, you can still find plenty of examples on eBay. Fans were also encouraged to 'say aloha' to two new shades of the brand's Hoola bronzer in 2019.  The appropriation and commodification of traditional Hawaiian culture has long had its critics. This latest PR trip has only added fuel to the fire.  Comments on Benefit's Instagram post include sentiments like: 'You're so out of touch...I'm embarrassed for you.' Another user said: 'But native Hawaiians are literally asking people not to go. Don't tell me you ignored them? Why is your girly brand trip and coloniser mindset more important? What gives you.........the right?' This was followed by more critique on Twitter. We asked Benefit Cosmetics for comment and a spokesperson claimed the team is 'committed to supporting local communities in everything we do. Our global launch event in Hawaii is no different'.  'Across every touchpoint, we have partnered with cultural experts, local artisans, business owners, and entertainers from across the islands to ensure our time here is done responsibly and respectively,' they said.  'We have worked very closely and in dialogue with our partners and ensuring a cohesive working environment during our stay here. It is important to Benefit to organise meaningful activities and support the local organisations, the island's coastal foundations and facilities including small businesses in Hawaii.' Though we're yet to see what the influencers have been up to, the spokesperson said activities were chosen to 'pay tribute to the generations of Asian and Pacific Islanders, recognising and celebrating the contributions, history, achievements, and cultures'.  They also said the brand has carried out a beach clean at Manele- Hulopoe Marine Life Conservation District and made a donation to Sustainable Coastlines Hawaii, alongside supporting a number of local businesses.  'As always, supporting local communities is key to everything we do,' they said.  But some of these efforts have still fallen short on social media. When Benefit shared a separate Instagram post spotlighting 'treasures from our local Hawaiian friends', someone replied: 'It's really shitty that you had to post this instead of just not having a brand trip at all.'

A TikTok trend mocking Heard's facial expressions. Tweets demanding justice for a purportedly innocent Depp. A 'Fuck Amber Heard' mug that you can buy on Etsy for $12.90. Then there was the 'SNL' skit about the infamous poop incident, and the TikToks analysing whether Heard snorted a bump of cocaine while on the stand. The internet is having a field day.  But what's at stake in the case seems to have got lost in the media circus surrounding it.  The trial centres on a defamation lawsuit Depp filed against Heard for $50m (PS40m), claiming that Heard damaged his career and income by publicly discussing allegations of domestic violence against Depp. The lawsuit is based on a 2018 op-ed Heard wrote in the Washington Post discussing her experience of domestic and sexual violence throughout her life.  Heard has accused Depp of sexual, physical and emotional abuse, often triggered by his allegedly heavy drinking and drug use, over the course of their four-year relationship. She has filed a countersuit for $100m (PS80.1m), alleging Depp defamed her when his attorneys stated that her abuse allegations were a hoax. Depp claims Heard was the one who was physically violent in their relationship and denies all accusations of physical abuse on his part.  But the trial isn't, per se, about who did what. Depp is seeking a massive amount of money from Heard for publishing that op-ed - even though she never named him. The actor only identifies herself as a survivor of intimate partner violence, writing that two years prior to publication she 'became a public figure representing domestic abuse'. It's become more and more common for victims to be sued for defamation, especially in the wake of the Me Too movement, which saw a litany of high-profile and famous men accused of sexual assault. But it's less common for survivors to face defamation lawsuits when they never actually name their alleged perpetrator.  And the consequences of a case like this could have a lasting impact - not just on Hollywood stars, but also on ordinary people. In the same way that a few high-profile Me Too cases against the likes of Harvey Weinstein quickly cascaded through society, forcing reckonings in almost every aspect of American life, some people fear that if Depp is successful in making it costly to call out abuse, that could have a chilling effect that is similarly contagious. 'The main thing that's at stake here is whether women are allowed to identify publicly as survivors of gender-based violence,' Dr Nicole Bedera, a sociologist focused on gender-based violence, tells HuffPost.  'In that op-ed, Amber Heard was coming out in support of other survivors during the height of the Me Too moment. That kind of political organising wasn't really all that controversial before, and now it's becoming controversial,' says Bedera. 'It is a very slippery slope we could be headed down.' The standard in defamation cases doesn't require specifically using someone's name - if a person can reasonably deduce who someone is talking about with some degree of certainty, then that's enough. But legal experts tell HuffPost that a defamation case like this one is still in the minority.  'I wouldn't say it's common, but I wouldn't say it's unheard of,' Alena Allen, interim dean and professor of law at the University of Arkansas, says of defamation cases in which a survivor does not name their alleged perpetrator.  Depp's attorneys argue it's clear Heard is referring to their client in the op-ed, based on the timeline of the article and the timeline of the two actors' relationship, which went on for about four years. Depp testified during the trial that Disney dropped him from the Pirates Of The Caribbean franchise days after the op-ed published, costing him $22.5m, according to his manager's testimony.  But Depp's career had already taken several hits by the time the op-ed was published. The infamous Rolling Stone profile, which painted Depp as a mentally unstable, isolated and drug-fuelled celebrity past his prime, came out months prior to Heard's essay. Years earlier, Harry Potter fans criticised the franchise for including Depp in the Fantastic Beast series after Heard got a restraining order against Depp, citing physical abuse. The actor was later cut from the third instalment of Fantastic Beasts after he lost a libel case in 2018 against the British newspaper The Sun, which published an article that described him as a 'wife-beater'.  In addition to the type of defamation suit, the prominent nature of the case (every minute of the four week-trial has been livestreamed) could have far-reaching consequences well beyond ignorant TikToks and mindless tweets.  'This is so high profile and so widely covered... the potential impact here is the chilling effect on survivors who are going to add this to the calculation with all the other barriers there are: Do I talk about my experience? Do I report it? Do I talk about it publicly in any way, or even in circles of people in my life?' says Jennifer Becker, the legal director at Legal Momentum, a legal defence and education fund for women. If survivors are more reluctant to seek relief - whether it's from their employer, their school, the police or even a loved one - it means they will likely continue to stay in situations of violence. And the way the public is treating Heard, a self-identified domestic violence survivor, feels like an added layer of discouragement for any victim contemplating coming forward, Bedera says.  'From the very beginning, Amber Heard was facing a huge uphill battle performing what a perfect victim should look like,' she says. 'It's so easy to violate the perfect victim standard because it's contradictory. It's literally impossible to obtain. So it's not surprising, when an entire case is meant to pick apart a victim's behaviour, that it would lead people to think that Heard wasn't a good victim, or that she deserved what happened to her.' Another method often used to discredit victims is the idea of 'mutual abuse'. Mutual abuse was introduced into the trial after a clinical psychologist who was also the couple's former marriage counsellor used the phrase to describe the actors' relationship in testimony. The psychologist testified that Depp told her that Heard 'gave as good as she got' when it came to physical violence. But many domestic violence experts disagree, arguing that mutual abuse isn't really feasible in a situation of intimate partner violence. Some, like Bedera, believe this is just another perpetrator tactic referred to as D.A.R.V.O. - which stands for Deny, Attack and Reverse Victim and Offender. The perpetrator may deny the behaviour, attack the victim for confronting him, and then reverse the roles of victim and offender by blaming the victim for his violent behaviour.  'People say, 'How do you know which one to believe, should you believe both? We believe victims.' And that is exactly how D.A.R.V.O. is supposed to operate,' says Bedera. 'It is intended to make you doubt who is the victim and who is not. It's really common and it's really effective.'  No matter the outcome of the case, experts and advocates agree that a case as high-profile as this one will impact cultural conversations around gender-based violence - and probably not for the better.  'I do think this is going to add to the reasons survivors fear disclosing,' says Becker, of Legal Momentum. 'And that consequence might bear out, regardless of the outcome of this case.'

European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic said the bloc will 'need to respond with all measures at its disposal' if the UK government presses ahead with legislation to over-ride the post-Brexit agreement on trade between Great Britain and the province. A trade war could see punishing tariffs being slapped on British goods being sold to the EU, harming UK businesses and driving up prices in the shops. Truss told MPs that ministers were prepared to bring forward a new law within weeks unless the EU agrees to renegotiate the protocol, something it has so far refused to do. The agreement, which Boris Johnson signed up to, introduces customs checks on goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. That has led to the DUP refusing to enter a power-sharing executive with Sinn Fein unless the protocol is radically redrawn. In her Commons statement, Truss proposed separate 'green' and 'red' lanes for goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, with those destined to stay within the UK freed from EU-level checks. She said the bill will put in place the necessary measures to 'lessen the burden on east-west trade and to ensure the people of Northern Ireland are able to access the same benefits as the people of Great Britain'. But in response, Sefcovic said: 'Should the UK decide to move ahead with a bill disapplying constitutive elements of the protocol as announced today by the UK Government, the EU will need to respond with all measures at its disposal. 'Our overarching objective is to find joint solutions within the framework of the protocol. That is the way to ensure legal certainty and predictability for people and businesses in Northern Ireland. 'With political will and commitment, practical issues arising from the implementation of the protocol in Northern Ireland can be resolved. 'The European Commission stands ready to continue playing its part, as it has from the outset.' Boris Johnson insisted problems with the protocol must be addressed. On a visit to Paddington station, west London, he said: 'What that actually involves is getting rid of some relatively minor barriers to trade. 'I think there are good, common sense, pragmatic solutions. We need to work with our EU friends to achieve that.'", "45b427af50e804b7b4cf778167f424beff30b81dcfb24d46c2d7bd29": "People are facing an 'apocalyptic' increase in food prices, the governor of the Bank of England warned on Monday. Food inflation accelerated to 3.5% in April, up from 3.3% in March - the highest inflation rate since March 2013.  Archie Norman, the chairman of Marks & Spencer, has warned food prices could even soar by as much as 10% this year. But why is this happening? One key reason is of supply chain problems and surging energy costs caused by the war. 'What's happening is global prices are rising, it's not to do with UK food so much as the effect of freight costs, wheat prices, oil and energy prices knocking onto almost everything,' Norman explained. 'As a consequence, all food retailers in the UK are - because we operate on very thin margins - going to have to reluctantly allow some food price inflation to run through the system.' Global energy prices have soared, in part as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, because supply is disrupted.  This means not only does it cost more for food manufacturers, such as farmers, to make products, but more expensive petrol means literally transporting the food to shops costs more.  Ukraine and Russia also supply a lot of important basic food materials. Russia and Ukraine are both key suppliers of wheat, with around 30% of the world's supply coming from those two countries. To make matters worse, India, the world's second largest supplier of wheat, has also banned exports after a heatwave damaged production and sent domestic prices rocketing. Similarly, Ukraine is the world's main supplier of sunflower oil, and Russia is the second-largest supplier. The majority of the UK's sunflower oil comes from Ukraine. The price of oils and fats for food increased by 7.2% in March alone, adding to a more than 18% rise in the last year. The cost of nitrogen fertiliser, used to grow food in the UK, has also more than tripled. Russia is a key supplier of fertiliser.  This all comes as workers have seen their pay fall further behind rocketing inflation. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) revealed that regular pay excluding bonuses dropped by 2.9% in March - the biggest fall since November 2011. But data from the ONS are expected to show that inflation hit 9.1% in the year to April.", "520ca2065ffc2c486e629470be5bc525df5f6cba43a8b97478809c48": "Liz Truss has set out her intention to bring forward legislation within weeks overwriting parts of the post-Brexit deal on Northern Ireland. The Bill will propose separate 'green' and 'red' lanes for goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, with those destined to stay within the UK freed from EU-level checks. There will be no crossover between the channels, it is understood, with goods filtering through one or the other, depending on their intended destination. The legislation is due in the 'coming weeks', before the summer recess. It had been heavily tipped to have been introduced to parliament on Tuesday. Truss told the Commons the Bill will put in place the necessary measures to 'lessen the burden on east-west trade and to ensure the people of Northern Ireland are able to access the same benefits as the people of Great Britain'. 'The Bill will ensure that goods moving and staying within the UK are freed of unnecessary bureaucracy through our new green channel,' she said. 'This respects Northern Ireland's place in the UK, in its customs territory, and protects the UK internal market. 'At the same time it ensures that goods destined for the EU undergo the full checks and controls applied under EU law.' This will be underpinned by 'data-sharing arrangements', she said. 'It will allow both east-west trade and the EU single market to be protected whilst removing customs paperwork for goods remaining in the United Kingdom,' she added. Truss went on to say the Bill will remove regulatory barriers to goods made to UK standards being sold in Northern Ireland, with businesses able to choose between meeting UK or EU standards in a new 'dual regulatory regime'. The legislation will also provide the government with the ability to decide on tax and spend policies across the whole of the UK, she said. She added: 'It will address issues related to governance, bringing the protocol in line with international norms. 'At the same time it will take new measures to protect the EU single market by implementing robust penalties for those who seek to abuse the new system.' It is understood that the UK would pull the Bill in the event of all of its aims and objectives being met by the EU. The option of invoking Article 16 will remain on the table. More details are expected to be set out in the coming weeks.", "afa5fb74094a77107d1969dad503d48ea70666c4560293c7ff77e8c9": "Marianna Vyshemirsky, the pregnant woman photographed escaping a bombed maternity hospital in Mariupol who became a symbol of Russian president Vladimir Putin's bloody war on Ukraine, said she received death threats after false suggestions the photos were fake. 'I received threats that they would come and find me, that I would be killed, that my child would be cut into pieces,' Vyshemirsky told the BBC's Marianna Spring. The BBC interview was arranged through Denis Seleznev, a blogger who backs pro-Russian separatists. Speaking from a separatist part of her native Donbas region, where she has since relocated, the 29-year-old woman who used to work as a beauty influencer described how her life changed overnight. 'We had a quiet and simple life,' Vyshermirsky said. 'And then, of course, things were turned upside down.' She described the dramatic scene at the maternity hospital after it was bombed on March 9, with patients and staff staying in the basement for 15 minutes before they were evacuated. She was one of the last to leave, she told the BBC's 'War on Truth' podcast, because she was not as badly injured as some others. She became subject to online abuse following a Russian campaign to discredit the photos of her as fake. The claims that she used makeup to paint her bruises started on a pro-Russian Telegram channel. The claims later spread to mainstream Russian media. 'It was really offensive to hear that, because I actually lived through it all,' she said. Still, she does not blame the Russians, but instead The Associated Press journalists who took the photos, claiming they did not speak to enough people impacted by the attack and allowed readers to get 'the impression that it was all staged.'  AP didn't immediately reply to HuffPost's request for comment. This is not the first time Russia has used such tactics to undermine photos and news reports documenting the reality of its war on Ukraine. Russian state TV channels suggested photos and video depicting the atrocities in Bucha were fake. Some Russian media claimed Ukraine staged war crimes to gain world sympathy.  Ukraine's deputy defense minister said more than 260 fighters were evacuated from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol on Monday. The country continues to evacuate those remaining, saying they had 'completed their mission,' AP reported.

Ever since Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine in February, Moscow has been clamping down on any form of dissent which cast doubt on the war effort, with protesters being mysteriously arrested across the country. Instead, the Kremlin maintained that Russia had no choice but to start a war - falsely accusing their European neighbours of being run by neo-Nazis. As the weeks drag by, Russia has left a trail of destruction through Ukraine but ultimately has not been able to declare any concrete victories. Military analyst Mikhail Khodarenok has subsequently made headlines around the world for being the first senior Russian commentator to reveal the Kremlin is on the back foot and likely to lose. Speaking on Russian state TV, he said: 'Let's not consume info-sedatives. 'Sometimes information is being spread about some sort of psychological breakdown in Ukraine's Armed Forces, suggesting some sort of a breakthrough is imminent. 'None of this has a basis in reality. ''Of course, there are separate incidences with prisoners of war, some divisions, but those are separate incidents. 'We should be looking at the totality of circumstances.' He continued: 'Ukraine's Armed Forces can arm one million men. One million of armed Ukrainian soldiers should be accepted as a result of the near future. 'We should consider that in our strategic calculations. 'The situation in that sense for us will keep worsening. ''As far as the desire to defend their Homeland, according to the understanding that exists in Ukraine, it's most definitely present there. ''It is a component of an Army's high combat capability, it's one of the most important components.' As the TV host and hardline propagandist Olga Skabeyeva tried to undermine his claims, he replied: 'The most important thing is remain realistic.' Suggesting that Russia needs to be aware of just how strong the Ukrainian resistance is, he explained: 'If you don't then sooner or later reality will hit you so hard you won't know what's hit you. He said the Ukrainian Army's professionalism stems from its level of training and 'its morale and readiness to shed blood' for their country. Despite his words, the anchor maintained that Russia's entire existence is on the line and that they had 'no choice' in invading Ukraine. Khodarenok just pointed to the geopolitical isolation Russia is now facing, explaining that 'the whole world is against us, even if we don't want to admit it'', urging the Kremlin to resolve it as soon as possible. Th BBC's Francis Scarr, who translated the video, called it 'damning' take on the war. This is not the first time Khodarenok has spoken out against Russia. Ten days ago, the analysis dismantled the idea that Russian mobilisation would work, pointing out: 'We don't have the reserves, the pilots or the planes, so the mobilisation would be of little help.' He added: 'Sending people armed with weapons of yesteryear to fight against global-standard Nato weapons would not be the right thing to do.' Other commentators, such military analyst Konstantin Sivko, have also pointed out that the conditions are not favourable for a Russian victory right now. He said: 'Current economic market system is unfit to meet the needs of our Armed Forces and of the entire country under the conditions.' It appears morale is flagging among the general public in Russia, too. One local told The Guardian: 'I look at my government totally different since the war started. There are some very harsh things I would like to say about our leadership, but maybe best if I don't because they would put me in prison for it.' In late March, Moscow admitted that around 1,351 soldiers had been killed and 3,825 wounded in the first month. Since then, Russia has only said that the subsequent casualties are 'significant', although some Western estimates suggest the death toll could now be up to 30,000 soldiers. Russian troops' recent attempt to cross the Ukrainian Donets River - which failed, dramatically - alone left more than 485 Russians dead and up to 80 vehicles destroyed, according to the Institute for the Study of War. Russia has also been accused of hiding the real number of dead from its public, to keep people on side. There have been reports that Vladimir Putin is now commanding various elements of the war himself, despite his senior position - suggesting he is conscious that the conflict is not going as he had hoped.", "22f277493640ce32d0bf50218e763f04717572a13acae37d8adb6310": "In the months leading up to her wedding day, Elizabeth was looking forward to seeing all of her guests, but she did not anticipate how much people would try to monopolise her time.  'Several of my husband's family friends, who I'd barely even met, kept coming up to me during the reception and then they would proceed to talk for 20 minutes,' she recalled to HuffPost.  Once, she was stopped for a long conversation while trying to awkwardly balance plates and drinks for herself and the groom on the way to their table. And she almost didn't make the group photo with the couple's college friends because a guest she was speaking with wouldn't let her end their chat.  'It was sweet because clearly they were excited to be there and wanted to catch up, and obviously I wanted to say hi to as many people as I could -- but this was more than just a greeting,' said Elizabeth, who preferred to share only her first name. 'They just had no awareness of time and the context.' Of course, most newlyweds want to spend time with their wedding guests --hey, that's why they were invited in the first place -- but if they were to have a lengthy conversation with every single person, there would be no time for dining, dancing, cutting the cake or anything else. Thus, it's an etiquette no-no to demand extra time or attention from the happy couple.  'To be a gracious guest, you have to be aware that the bride and groom have a lot of people to see and thank and be mindful not to monopolise their time,' said Jacqueline Whitmore, an etiquette expert and founder of The Protocol School of Palm Beach. 'But a lot of people don't have that kind of common sense.' So what's the best way to share a moment with the newlyweds at the wedding? Below, Whitmore and other etiquette experts share their dos and don'ts.  Keep the conversation brief.  'The bridal couple is rightly in high demand on their special day,' said Thomas P. Farley, aka 'Mister Manners.' 'Particularly if there are a great number of attendees, guests should not dominate the attention of the newlyweds with long conversations.' He advised keeping the congratulations and chatter to a minute or two. Offer your well wishes and compliment the wedding dress, food, ceremony, venue or band.  'If guests have had the chance to speak with the couple at least once during the occasion, they should not attempt to co-opt additional time, unless circumstances permit,' Farley added. You can also spend more time with the newlyweds by joining them and the other guests on the dance floor. Making memories together doesn't always involve talking.  Nick Leighton, an etiquette expert and co-host of the 'Were You Raised by Wolves?' podcast, believes the amount of time you'll want to talk with the couple is on a bell curve and based on how close you are.  'If you're super close with the couple and hang out with them all the time, it's fine to be brief,' he said. 'Similarly, if you're such a distant acquaintance that you were surprised to even be invited, your chat with the newlyweds can also be relatively quick. But in the middle, the time you spend will often be slightly longer given there'll often be a bit of catching-up on everyone's lives involved.'  Keep it light. 'Guests should also ensure they keep conversation light and breezy,' Farley said. Avoid politics, family squabbles, drunken ramblings or important conversations they'd need to remember in the future. This is not the time to share big news or choose a date to grab lunch together.  'The Champagne is flowing, the relief is showing, and the occasion is flying by for them at hyper speed,' he added. 'Guests can focus their energies on the other guests in attendance and catch up with the couple after they've returned from their honeymoon.' Take advantage of the receiving line. 'Rather than continually seeking them out at various points during the reception, guests should have their words with the pair on the receiving line -- if there is one -- or on the dance floor,' Farley said. 'A benefit of the former strategy is it all but guarantees getting to speak with both members of the couple at once, which may prove difficult or impossible once the reception begins.' Instead of a receiving line, many couples take time to make the rounds and greet every table during dinner. Similarly, consider this your designated moment to share your thanks and congratulations or get a photo together. Take cues from the couple. 'The best way to speak with the wedding couple is by being aware of your surroundings,' said Jodi R.R. Smith, president of Mannersmith Etiquette Consulting, . Pay attention to what's going on. If you would like to have a slightly longer chat at some point, don't try to do it while the newlyweds are occupied, stressed out or en route to cut the cake.  'Take your cues from the couple,' Smith advised. 'If there is a crowd forming or if the couples' eyes are glazing, it is time to more along.'  Say you look forward to catching up at a later date. The wedding reception is not really the time to have a full catch-up with the newly married couple, so if you want the the chance to have a proper conversation with them, mention that you'd love to get together sometime in the future. 'I would suggest for a wedding guest, you go up to the couple, offer your congratulations, say how beautiful the bride looks and then add something like 'Thank you so much for inviting us, we'll definitely have you and Jim over for dinner when you come back from your honeymoon!'' Whitmore said.  Then give them a hug and carry on enjoying the rest of the event, food and dance floor with your fellow guests. You can reach out and make a concrete plan with the newlyweds at a later date.  Accept that you might not get to talk at all. Etiquette guidelines dictate that newlyweds should try to greet all of their guests at some point during the event, but at larger weddings, people inevitably slip through the cracks.  'You may not get to talk with the bride or groom at all,' noted etiquette expert Juliet Mitchell, also known as Ms. J, told HuffPost. 'The wedding is a gathering of friends, family and sometimes associates. The bride and wedding planner have taken under consideration who will be there, where they will sit, dance, etc. so that they can interact, engage and socialise with each other. One-to-one conversation may not happen. Be OK with that, and if you are a friend, connect with them after the wedding. Don't worry about saying goodbye. Unless you happen to pass by them on your way out, you also don't have to have a farewell moment with the happy couple -- unless they specifically asked you to. 'Guests should not feel the need to say goodbye to the couple prior to leaving -- especially if they will be departing before the end of the night,' Farley said. 'Rather, an Irish exit is entirely appropriate here, letting the celebration and merriment continue without an external reminder that the night is drawing to a close.'", "949985685455782974cb5b868081e96dfcc646b4e91eac5f1dfb8570": "From Instagram to TikTok to podcasts, there's a ton of information floating around about the ingredients found in many plant-based milks. There's carrageenan, xanthan gum, lecithin and more, and they're often framed as 'scary' or 'unhealthy,' which is a bit understandable in some regards. If you were to pull a plant-based milk from your pantry or refrigerator right now and look at the ingredient list, there's a very strong chance you'd notice some additives and ingredients that you're completely in the dark about.  But are these ingredients all that scary? Should we avoid them for the sake of our health?  Given that most of us have little understanding of what the heck carrageenan and other plant-based milk ingredients even are, it feels like a good time to get to the bottom of it. Here's what you need to know about some common ingredients found in non-dairy milks.  Carrageenan Carrageenan is a food additive made from red seaweed that's often used in almond milk and other plant-based milks as a thickener, emulsifier or stabiliser. One huge reason carrageenan is used so frequently in these products is that it's plant-based, whereas gelatin and many other thickeners are made from animal products.  Is carrageenan safe to consume? Carrageenan comes in two forms -- food grade (undegraded) and degraded. Undegraded carrageenan is FDA approved in the US for human consumption and said to be safe for food use, whereas degraded carrageenan is not approved for use in food and has been shown to be carcinogenic in studies on animals. In the UK, carrageenan is listed among the additives approved by the Food Standards Agency (FSA).  There's some controversy around the health effects of both forms of carrageenan. Research shows that even food-grade carrageenan can cause potential side effects like inflammation, bloating, irritable bowel syndrome, intestinal ulcers and other gastrointestinal problems. It's challenging to conduct this type of study on humans for a number of reasons, so most studies of carrageenan are on animals. 'Some researchers believe that potential adverse gastrointestinal side effects could be linked to the consumption of carrageenan, even the food-safe kind, as it breaks down during digestion,' said registered dietitian Maddie Pasquariello. 'That said, as a registered dietitian, I have not seen any conclusive evidence that would lead me to eliminate this ingredient completely from my diet.' She adds that we may never know with 100% certainty if carrageenan is harmful, due to research constraints. It's hard to say whether carrageenan is safe or unsafe, and some registered dieticians recommend avoiding it entirely. People who tend to experience gastrointestinal symptoms after consuming products with carrageenan may feel better eliminating this ingredient from their diet, or consuming it in moderation, Pasquariello said. Natural Flavours 'Natural flavours' is a somewhat vague term that describes ingredients that are derived from plant and animal products, such as from spices, fruits, vegetables, herbs, dairy products, meat and eggs, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In the UK, all flavouring is subject to approval. 'All flavourings and each constituent of a flavouring blend must be safe under general food law legislation,' the FSA says. 'In addition, some flavourings must undergo a safety evaluation before they're authorised for use in food in Great Britain.'  Natural flavours are added to non-dairy milks to enhance their taste. Often, they're added to make the milk taste more like the drink's base ingredient -- such as almonds, soy or oats -- or to give it a distinct flavour profile, registered dieticians explained. Are natural flavours safe to consume? Natural flavours are regulated and said to be safe for consumption, but they're not necessarily 'healthier' or safer than artificial flavours, said registered dietitian Rachel Fine. It's important to understand that the term 'natural' can be a bit misleading here. Natural flavours aren't necessarily ingredients that come straight from the earth. Sure, the ingredient may be derived from a plant or animal product, but it can later be synthetically enhanced with preservatives and other ingredients. Because natural flavours are so vaguely defined, someone buying a plant-based milk may not know exactly what is in the natural flavours that have been added. Thus, it's hard to say whether or not they'll experience side effects after consumption, said registered dietitian Shirlene Reid. She goes on to explain that if the natural flavour doesn't contain a common allergen like eggs or milk, food manufacturers aren't required by the FDA to reveal what's in their natural flavours. This is also the case in the UK. Gums If you read the ingredient lists on your plant-based milks, you've probably come across guar gum or other gums like xanthan, gellan or locust bean. These gums are added to non-dairy milks as stabilisers and emulsifiers, often helping to mix or thicken things up. 'These bind ingredients, keeping them emulsified and suspended,' Fine explained. 'Some gums, like xanthan gum, help to thicken the milk for a desirable consistency.' If you buy a plant-based milk that's made with only a nut or seed and water (meaning, no other additives), you may notice a separation between a liquid layer and a more pulpy layer at the bottom. 'Since nuts and seeds contain fat, when blended and combined with water, the two don't want to mix, so natural separation will occur,' Pasquariello said.  Another interesting thickener you'll see often is oil -- sunflower oil, rapeseed oil, canola oil, coconut oil or palm oil, and more -- which is used for its emulsifying properties. Are these gums safe to consume? The registered dieticians we spoke to say the short answer is yes. But some people may experience side effects like an upset stomach (especially with guar gum and xanthan gum), depending on how much they consume. A recent study in the journal Nature Microbiology found that xanthan gum may alter the gut microbiome in ways that could potentially affect intestinal health and caloric intake. Lecithin  Lecithin is an additive commonly used in commercial food production. It's added to plant-based milks as an emulsifier, to help combine different ingredients like oats, nuts or seeds with water. You may see it on an ingredient list as sunflower lecithin or soy lecithin.  Is lecithin safe to consume? Studies show that consuming lecithin is safe, and some people even take it as a supplement. But there are some potential downsides to this additive. 'Depending on the quantity consumed, lecithin can lead to adverse gastrointestinal side effects, like diarrhoea, nausea and stomach pain,' Pasquariello said. Though she pointed out that this side effect is mainly seen when lecithin is consumed as a supplement.  'Very few side effects have been seen in scientific literature when consuming food amounts -- such as the amount found in your plant-based milk,' she told us. Tips To Keep In Mind While Shopping For Plant-Based Milks   Pay attention to ingredients. 'Many people who are buying plant-based milks, who do not have an allergy to regular milk, are buying it because they may think they are getting a healthier form of milk,' Reid said. 'It's important to know what is actually in the milk before you buy it to prevent future health problems.'   Go for products with simple ingredient lists, if that's important to you. 'If it matters to you that your plant-based milk is made from the simplest ingredients possible, and you have the ability to access such products, you may wish to buy brands that list only two to three ingredients (like nuts or seeds or oats, plus water and sea salt),' Pasquariello advised.   Just because an ingredient is unfamiliar doesn't necessarily mean it's harmful to your health. 'Many consumers fear additives in food, but the truth is, these additives serve a very functional purpose not only to improve the taste of our food but to also make our food safe for consumption,' Fine said. 'Despite common myths, these ingredients have been thoroughly tested for safety.'   Know that for the most part, plant-based milks are safe to consume. 'If you can't access plant-based milk made with only a few ingredients, it's not something to worry significantly about,' Pasquariello said.

Voters will soon elect new MPs for Wakefield in Yorkshire and Tiverton and Honiton in Devon, it was confirmed on Tuesday.  The likely date for both, as first reported by The Times, is June 23, the sixth anniversary of the UK's vote to leave the European Union. Both seats are currently held by the Conservatives, but the party risks losing Wakefield to Labour and Tiverton to the Lib Dems amid a spiralling cost of living crisis. The contest in Wakefield was triggered after Conservative MP Imran Ahmad Khan was convicted for sexually assaulting a boy. The Tories won the seat 3,358 in 2019, until then it had been held by Labour since 1932. Winning back a parliamentary seat in the so-called red wall would be a huge boost for Keir Starmer ahead of the next general election. In Tiverton, a by-election was triggered after Tory MP Neil Parish quit over revelations he watched porn on his phone in the Commons chamber. Parish won the seat in 2019 with a healthy majority of 24,239 over Labour, it has been Conservative since its creation in 1997. But while Labour is currently in second place, the constituency had for many years been a close fight between the Tories and the Lib Dems. The Lib Dems, boosted by the capture of neighbouring Somerset council in the local elections earlier this month, are hoping for a resurgence in their former south west heartland. The party is aiming to repeat its success at the recent North Shropshire by-election, where it overturned a 23,000 Tory majority held by disgraced MP Owen Patterson.", "f4ee77e07c5febea0209bc1f923710e8ac1251f76c362abd6690ccea": "Boris Johnson has promised he will do all he can to fix the issues triggered by the Northern Ireland Protocol - but he seems to have forgotten that he's actually the person who agreed to it. The prime minister negotiated the protocol back in 2019 just months into his time in office. He hailed it as a breakthrough, considering negotiations about the UK's post-Brexit relationship with the EU had come to a standstill over Northern Ireland and a potential 'backstop' pushed by his predecessor, Theresa May. The protocol has now returned as the largest Unionist party (DUP) in the Northern Ireland Assembly is refusing to form an executive until their demands over the protocol are met. Although Johnson has vowed to resolve the crisis, he continues to blame the EU for the way the bloc has implemented the protocol, simultaneously downplaying his own role in signing up to it. But not many people are letting the prime minister get away with it that easily. He was cornered on Monday by various journalists who reminded him that he once championed the protocol as a 'great deal'. The BBC's political editor Chris Mason said: 'The reality of what you're dealing with today in Northern Ireland is a direct consequence of the deal you signed,' to which Johnson replied honestly: 'Yes, absolutely.' Then Channel 4's Paul McNamara took a firmer line, telling Johnson: 'Two years in, this deal, this protocol has caused the collapse of the Northern Ireland Assembly, economic hardship for firms in Northern Ireland and now needs a major revision. 'Prime minister, you must be furious with whoever signed off on a deal this bad.' Johnson replied, claiming that his priority was getting the Northern Ireland Assembly up and running, adding that 'not a single one' of the five parties he spoke to liked the protocol. He did not point out that many of these worries were first raised by politicians back in 2019. Johnson continued: 'Yes, I agreed it, but I agreed it on the basis that it protected the Good Friday Agreement, it protected the East-West strand of the agreement.' The Good Friday Agreement is the 1998 peace deal which ended the violence in Northern Ireland by ensuring the devolved government could only operate by giving a voice to Unionists and Nationalists. He said that he was also under the impression that it would protect the UK internal market, and 'that was the reason I went for it, because it seemed to me like those were things that our friends in the EU would mean sincerely'. McNamara replied: 'But you can't be surprised by any of the bits you don't like at the moment. 'Pretty much all of them were in the impact assessment papers.' Johnson said 'of course' he read them, but added: 'I hoped and believed that our friends would not necessarily want to apply the protocol in quite the way that they have.' Johnson's diplomatic attempts in Belfast on Monday have not gone down well either. The nationalist party Sinn Fein, which just took a majority in the recent elections, said they had a 'fairly tough meeting' with the prime minister and received 'no straight answers' about the protocol's future. The party also expressed concern that abandoning elements of the protocol would 'amplify the bad faith with which the Tory government has conducted itself from the beginning of the entire Brexit debacle', while claiming Johnson was just trying to placate the DUP. Meanwhile, the DUP said that 'the idea the prime minister is taking sides is for the fairies', while claiming that its mandate to see the protocol replaced with arrangements that restore our place within the UK internal market 'will be respected'. Alliance, the third largest party in the Assembly which is centrist, also said the meeting with Johnson was 'robust and very frustrating'. They explained: 'We were giving him a very clear warning that if he plays fast and loose with the protocol and indeed the Good Friday Agreement, that he is going to be adding more and more instability to Northern Ireland. 'On the one hand, he is coming here with a certain set of states outcomes, but all his actions belie what he is notionally trying to achieve.'", "4bf636c8a2f644b3829ce2d3c17d8f816e822c519e89e3ade1440b12": "The minister responsible for refugees has refused to endorse the government's controversial plan to send illegal immigrants to Rwanda. Lord Harrington repeatedly dodged the question while being interviewed on Times radio. The government was hit by a furious backlash when home secretary Priti Patel unveiled the Rwanda plan last month. Under the policy, illegal immigrants will be flown one-way from the UK to the African country to start new lives there.  The move is designed to prevent asylum seekers trying to cross the Channel from France in dangerous boats. Asked if he endorsed the plan, Harrington - who only returned to government in April to sort out the Ukrainian visa scheme - said: 'Well, I'm a minister for Ukrainian refugees. And it's my job to resettle them. 'They come in via legal routes. I mean, it is a legal route to come in as refugees from Ukraine. And this country has always been very good at legal routes.  'Illegal routes are different and the government has to do what it thinks right to try and stop these people smugglers from smuggling people in.' Asked again if the Rwanda plan sent the right message about the UK's attitude towards immigrants, he said: 'Well, as I say, I'm the minister for Ukrainian refugees. 'I was given this project to do by the government, which I changed my life to do and that's what I'm doing...I'm doing what I've been asked to do by the prime minister.' It is not the first time Harrington has indicated his opposition to the Rwanda policy. Asked about the plans before they were announced, he said: 'If it's happening in the Home Office, in the same corridor I'm in, they haven't told me about it. 'I'm having difficulty enough getting them from Ukraine to our country. There's no possibility of sending them to Rwanda.'    On Rwanda he said:", "294a283b68199989c78040e5bfae61712862b172d1e6e2411869e9e5": "TV star Charlie King today spoke out about how having plastic surgery plunged him into the 'depths of despair'. King, 36, who has spoken out about having body dysmorphia, underwent a nose job after the first Covid-19 lockdown that did not go to plan. He told MPs there needed to be more awareness around mental health before someone is allowed to spend thousands of pounds on surgery.  King also argued that there needed to be 'more transparency' in influencer culture. Speaking to the Commons Health and Social Care Committee, which is carrrying out an inquiry into the impact of body image on mental and physical health, King said his problems started at his all boys' school, where he was severely bullied. He said: 'With the plastic surgeons, I feel they need to at least offer the accessibility to potential mental health resources, body dysmorphia analysis, working with the charities and foundations to understand their condition. 'Because I had, I don't want to say botched nose job, I had a nose job that didn't go to plan. I couldn't do anything about it. 'There I was, with scar tissue, a collapsed columellar and the surgeon was like you have to wait. So every day of my life until I had surgery number two I just had to get on with it. 'I went to the depths of my despair, hence I've had to move back and live with my mum right now because I couldn't earn money, I was depressed, I'm still not myself.' He said there were no resources to help him while he waited a year for the next surgery, adding: 'That year, and still is, one of the most challenging times of my life because I took a decision because I thought there was an improvement to be made.' King, who found fame when he starred in The Only Way Is Essex back in 2012, said he is regularly contacted by people on social media who want to offer him Botox, fillers or veneers.  King said becoming an influencer was like a 'dopamine hit' that feels great and you are offered a lot ofmoney to promote products.  However, he said you fall into 'webs' and there needed to be disclaimers on products, influencer content and filter use.  'You see someone and they've been altered, blown up or whatever it is and you don't really know what is real anymore,' he said. 'Some people absolutely love it and they're all for it. I call it the Kardashian lifestyle, it's that aspirational world where you can make loads of money and look fantastic and your life is like a movie star. 'But we need to get real about this. That is a very unique situation and they are what they are - and good luck to them. But the average person or average influencer will never get to that standard and I think there needs to be a lot more transparency in it. 'I think the Hollywood lifestyle image that it can portray needs to come down a notch, we need to get real a bit more.'  Health Minister Gillian Keegan will also face questions in the final session of the committee's inquiry on Tuesday. The committee is looking at the powers in the new Health and Care Act which allow the government to introduce a licensing regime for non-surgical cosmetic procedures, such as Botox.

A spokesperson for her TV production company, Rollem Productions, has announced that Kay died on Sunday.  In a statement, they said: 'It is with profound sadness that we announce the untimely and sudden passing of our beloved friend, mentor and colleague Kay Mellor on Sunday 15 May 2022. 'We have lost a phenomenal talent and a true luminary. We ask that you please respect the privacy of the family and friends at this time.' Leeds-born Kay was arguably best known for penning series Fat Friends, which focused on the members of a slimming group and aired from 2000 until 2005. The Bafta-nominated series starred James Corden, Ruth Jones, Alison Steadman and Kay's youngest daughter, Gaynor Faye, and was later turned into a stage musical. Kay appeared on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs in 2017 and chose The Beautiful South's Perfect 10, the Fat Friends theme tune, as one of her sound tracks, saying 'every time I heard that I used to get excited and get butterflies'. She explained: 'It was such a lovely time of my life, it was a drama that was really important to me because I thought I had something to say about weight and body image.' Kay began her career writing plays, worked on Coronation Street and created the award-winning children's drama Children's Ward. She also wrote BBC One's women's football series Playing The Field and co-wrote BBC drama The Chase with daughter Gaynor, who previously starred in both Coronation Street and Emmerdale. The BBC's chief content officer, Charlotte Moore, paid tribute to Kay in a statement, saying: 'I'm shocked and deeply saddened to hear that Kay Mellor has suddenly passed away. 'Kay was an outstanding writer and the creative force behind many of the nation's best-loved television dramas. 'She wrote with such heart, humanity, humour and passion with strong female characters often taking centre stage. 'She will be missed and our thoughts are with her friends and family at this difficult time.' Kay and her husband Anthony were married in 1968 and have two daughters, actor Gaynor Faye and television producer Yvonne Francas.", "3f78d9dd9593eacae143930c9b813609fbfe71339d4e7b698747aacf": "A government minister has been criticised for wrongly claiming there are more people in work now than before the Covid pandemic. Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis repeatedly made the claim during his broadcast round on Tuesday morning. However, data published by the Office for National Statistics this morning showed there are 504,000 fewer people in work than pre-coronavirus. Lewis told Sky News: 'We've got more people in work than we had even before Covid.' Later in the same interview, he said: 'We've more people in work than we had before Covid.' In a BBC interview an hour later, the cabinet minister said: 'It is good to see that we have now got employment at an even higher rate than pre-Covid.' Pointing out his error, BBC presenter Sally Nugent said: 'There are fewer people in work than before Covid.' But Lewis again claimed: 'Unemployment is actually below where it was before Covid. 'We've got more people in work than we had even before Covid.' But Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said: 'Total employment, while up on the quarter, remains below its pre-pandemic level. 'Since the start of the pandemic, around half a million more people have completely disengaged from the employment market.' The ONS statistics also showed that while Britain's unemployment rate had fallen to its lowest level for over 47 years at 3.7%, workers' wages still lagged behind inflation.   Earnings, when adjusted for inflation, also dropped by 1.2% between January and March, the ONS said. Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine said: 'The government is failing millions and is now repeating misleading statements.   'The reality is there are now fewer jobs than before the pandemic, while wages have fallen in real terms and inflation is going through the roof. 'No amount of mistruths will hide the disastrous state of the economy under the Conservatives 'We urgently need a VAT cut and a windfall tax to tackle this cost of living emergency.' Boris Johnson also made the incorrect claim at a session of prime minister's questions last month, saying there were 500,000 more people in work when there were in fact 500,000 fewer people employed in the UK now than there were pre-Covid.", "5694e5176a8d45e2859fa541c9763204e08b615231758eea1c2ad373": "Walk down the aisle of a supermarket, high street pharmacy or clothes shop and you'll know which is the women's side, thanks to the abundance of pink and gimmicky frills that are still (somehow) being sold to us. And we know it comes with a cost. Known as the 'pink tax', it's no secret that women's toiletries are more expensive than men, even if they're the same item (think razors, skincare, hair products). But our clothes are also more expensive than our counterparts. According to Office for National Statistics data, even women's underwear is not safe from inflation (despite having less material than men's). Sky News analysis found that your knickers cost on average 37% more than they did five years ago (whereas mens' smalls have gone up by just 25%). Bras have also gone up in price, by about as much as wages. Items such as nail varnish and perfume have soared by 40%.  Inflation has seen widespread price hikes, linked to supply chain disruption as a result of the pandemic, Brexit and the Ukraine-Russia conflict. So it makes sense that all clothing is more expensive, too. Even budget retailers such as Primark reported higher price tags. But why is there so much discrepancy between men and women's items? Well, it could be to do with post-pandemic demand. Think about it, for the past two years, our shopping habits have stalled due to lockdowns and lack of occasions to get dressed up. Now people are keen to make up for it. And Kayla Marci, market analyst at retail intelligence platform Edited, told Sky News that customers haven't been deterred by higher prices yet. 'That could be due to the post-pandemic 'revenge spending' phenomenon where, after being indoors and wearing sweatpants for so long, people are meeting up with friends again and looking to buying new outfits,' she says. But given the cost of living crisis, it's unlikely that the consumer zealousness will continue. Let's hope that prices come down - even if our underwear stays up.", "e5ea2a23208b532112730588d63686230e8cd541649880609a393589": "Boris Johnson's decision to delay a ban on buy-one-get-one-free deals for unhealthy food products has been blasted as 'shallow, politically weak and morally reprehensible' by former Tory leader William Hague. The government had planned to block multi-buy promotions on foods and drinks high in fat, salt, or sugar, but this has been put back to October 2023. A ban on TV adverts for HFSS products before a 9pm watershed and on paid-for adverts online is also being delayed by 12 months and will now come into effect in January 2024. Ministers said the government did not want to ban cheap food at a time of an 'unprecedented' squeeze on living standards. But writing in The Times on Tuesday, Hague said the cost of living argument was 'baseless' as research showed buy-one-get-one-free deals actually encourage people to spend more. 'Conservatives support freedom of choice but have always seen that it is sometimes necessary to prevent consumers being abused or misled,' the former party leader said. 'That is why we have laws on labelling, standards and monopolies. People have not made a voluntary choice to become obese.' Hague, who also served as foreign secretary under David Cameron and now sits in the Lords, added: 'MPs who have pressed, seemingly successfully, for the dilution of the obesity strategy are profoundly mistaken. 'They are acquiescing in a future of higher dependence, greater costs, reduced lifestyle choice and endless pain. 'For the government to give in to them is intellectually shallow, politically weak and morally reprehensible.' Health campaigners reacted with dismay at the decision to delay the ban.  Graham MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine at Queen Mary University of London and chairman of Action on Sugar and Action on Salt, said the delays completely contradicted the Johnson's 'levelling up' agenda. 'He has given in to his own MPs, and an aggressive food industry, who, ironically, were starting to comply with these new policies,' he said. Barbara Crowther, of the Children's Food Campaign, added: 'Obesity is spiking and millions of families can't afford to put proper food on the table. Multi-buy offers make people spend more on junk, and less on healthy food,' she said. 'This delay threatens the UK target to halve childhood obesity by 2030. Boris is playing politics with our children's health.'", "cee3207edfa973dd69d58081af76152446b437d5176f9a1969e151ad": "Harry Styles has spoken out about his relationship with his former One Direction bandmates six years after the group parted ways. The chart-topping singer was one of the original five members of One Direction, who were put together on The X Factor in 2010, alongside Louis Tominson, Niall Horan, Liam Payne and Zayn Malik, who quit the boyband while they were still active. During their time together, 1D went on to achieve huge success, topping the UK singles charts on four occasions, scooping up five Brit Awards and selling out stadiums all over the world. After going on an indefinite hiatus in 2016, the band's members have all embarked on solo careers, with varying levels of success. Harry - who won his first Grammy last year - is now gearing up for the release of his third solo album, and spoke to Apple Music's Zane Lowe about his time in the hit-making group. 'I look at people who kind of went through some version of what [One Direction] went through, but on their own. I can't imagine having done that, really,' he explained. 'I feel really lucky that we always had each other to be this unit that felt like you could keep each other in check and you could just have someone else who gets it. 'Because it's impossible to not, at times I think everyone experiences this, feel like, 'Oh, everyone else is on the other side of the glass and I'm on this side of the glass, and no one really gets it'. And I think having that is kind of priceless.' He continued: 'I think there is very much a respect between all of us, if we did something together. And that is something that you can't really undo. 'And you know, it's like a very deep love for each other, I think.' Last year, Liam Payne spoke out about his continued friendship with Harry. '[Harry] called me because he has a sixth sense for if I'm struggling or if one of us is in trouble I feel like,' the Strip That Down singer revealed.

The most recent episode of the BBC opened with Callum and Frankie (played by Tony Clay and Rose Ayling-Ellis) having a conversation about his relationship in the kitchen. To a clearly upset Callum, Frankie was heard joking: 'This is about the Eurovision isn't it? But Ukraine deserved that win and there's always next year.' He responded: 'I never used to watch it, and then Ben got me into it and... nul points every year, the one year we don't watch it together we get second.' While EastEnders is usually filmed months in advance, the scene referencing the Eurovision result was filmed at the eleventh hour to reference the UK's success in Turin over the weekend. In the past, EastEnders has included similar topical references to events like the Brexit referendum result, goings on in the Royal Family and England's performance in the Euro 2020 tournament last year. Saturday night saw Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra triumphing on the Eurovision stage, while the UK representative Sam Ryder gave us our best result in over 20 years when he finished in second place.

On Monday afternoon, the 17-year-old spoke his truth in a statement published on his club's official website. He said: 'I've hated lying my whole life and feeling the need to change to fit in. I want to be a role model myself by doing this. 'There are people out there in the same space as me that may not feel comfortable revealing their sexuality. I just want to tell them that you don't have to change who you are, or how you should be, just to fit in. You being you, and being happy, is what matters most.' Since speaking out, Jake has received countless positive messages, including from his peers in the football world. Former footballer Ian Wright also retweeted a message sending 'move love' to Jake and saying his coming out 'will also mean so much to so many and help to normalise something that should absolutely be normal'. The Football Association issued a statement saying: 'Football is a game for all, with diversity at its heart, and this is a hugely positive step as we strive to build an inclusive game that we can all be proud of. 'We are with you and hope your story will help to give people across the game the strength and encouragement to be their true self.'

Jake is the only current openly gay male professional player in the UK, and the first male professional footballer to come out publicly since the late Justin Fashanu 32 years ago.

During the latest instalment of Piers' topical Talk TV show, he spoke with 'Jame' a protester at a trans rights demonstration organised by the activist group Trans Rise Up. Jame wore a wig, sunglasses and face mask to obscure their true identity, with the former daytime star beginning the conversation by insisting he had 'always supported trans rights to fairness and equality and I mean that sincerely'. 'That's bullshit, bro,' his guest then suggested, with Piers responding: 'You can say 'bullshit, bro' and you're entitled to. It's an uncensored show and you've just proven it.' Jame then reminded the host that after a previous discussion about gender identity, the host had mockingly changed his Twitter profile picture to what Piers described at the time as a 'two-spirit penguin'. As the conversation continued, Piers apologised to viewers for Jame's language, before stating his 'issue' with trans women being allowed to compete alongside cisgender athletes in women's sport. 'I think it's very unfair that trans women should be competing against women born to female biological bodies,' he said, before Jame urged him to 'shut up, bro'. 'Do you understand that a majority of women athletes do not give a shit about trans women in sports?' Jame asked. Piers then said: 'You can't just call everyone who disagrees with you transphobic. If you keep swearing I'll have to cut you off.' The interview then culminated in Piers asking Jame what their issue was with his position, with the guest beginning to take off their mic, saying: 'I don't really know. I'm going to leave the interview, now. I kind of only came on here because I thought it would be kind of funny. But I wanted to say, 'you're a c***'.' Responding to the jibe, Piers branded Jame a 'complete idiot' and 'very unpleasant piece of work'. After apologising to viewers again later in the show, Piers added: 'It's a shame. I wanted to have a rational, sensible debate. They didn't, so that's it. They won't be back on and we move on.' Piers Morgan Uncensored launched last month with a much-publicised interview with former US president Donald Trump. However, since then, reports have claimed that viewing figures for Piers' show have taken a nosedive since its debut, with other programmes on Talk TV reportedly recording no audience at all at some points. Piers previously tweeted: 'Linear TV [is] increasingly irrelevant [compared] to total eyeball potential for a global show like this, especially with younger viewers who don't really watch TV any more.' This somewhat contradicts what the divisive broadcaster repeatedly used to say during his tenure on Good Morning Britain, when he would often goad BBC rival Dan Walker over their respective ratings.", "dcc8aedc8d308199d2546446d78b4a6b933a0a75675c566c08bdefa4": "We know we're supposed to throw out our makeup and skin care products once they're past their shelf life, even if we don't always adhere to that rule (guilty as charged right here). In fact, experts have warned that using a cosmetic product for too long can lead to allergic reactions and increased risk of bacterial infections. But does the same go for fragrance?  In my latest bout of spring cleaning, I discovered a couple of bottles of perfume that I'm pretty sure I received as gifts in college - which means I'd had them for at least eight years. When I sprayed them into the air, I was pleasantly surprised to find they still smelled quite nice.  Still, I couldn't help but feel like I might be committing some sort of fragrance world sin. To address these concerns and get some answers, I turned to perfume professionals. Below, fragrance experts break down whether perfume actually goes bad, how to detect if it has, what to do with it, and more.  Does perfume go bad? 'Yes, perfume can 'go bad,'' says perfumer and founder of Eat. Sweat. Undress Alexia P. Hammonds. 'Depending on certain variables like the bottle, ingredient quality, light exposure and where it's stored, perfume can 'go bad' anywhere between one to 10 years.' She noted that over time, perfume tends to undergo a process called oxidation, a chemical reaction that takes place when the substance is exposed to oxygen or other oxidising agents.  'There are three main reasons why perfume goes bad: light, heat and air, specifically oxygen,' says Sarah McCartney, perfumer and co-author of The Perfume Companion: The Definitive Guide to Choosing Your Next Scent. 'If you don't open a perfume - and the bottle is sealed perfectly - then it can last for decades. I've opened a 100-year-old bottle of Guerlain's L'Heure Bleue, and it was magnificent, absolutely perfect. It had an airtight glass stopper and had been kept in a warehouse in the dark.' She noted that the more oxygen there is in a bottle, the faster it can deteriorate. So if you've used up more than half of a bottle, don't try to save it for special occasions - just use it up. How long does it take to go bad? 'Perfume can lose its potency and sophistication of fragrance notes, but some perfumes can last for several years,' says Terry Carter, chief perfumer at Travertine Spa, Inc. 'It is recommended that perfumes are used within two to three years, depending on the ingredient composition.' Fragrances that are formulated with more natural ingredients have a shorter shelf life.  'These days most fragrances are formulated with synthetics which means that they are 'man made' or made in the lab from 'aroma chemicals' which try to duplicate natural ingredients,' says Sue Phillips, founder of Scenterprises. 'Therefore, because they are mostly not made from natural ingredients, they have a longer shelf life and don't change.' Certain scents might be more or less likely to last longer, as well. 'What I really notice is that fragrances with a lot of citruses turn faster,' says Sebastian Jara aka The Perfume Guy. 'If you ever have fruits or vegetables in your house in a bowl or something and they gone bad, imagine how they smell. That's what I pick up.' Fragrances that are in tightly sealed spray containers also stand a better chance than the ones in bottles you pour and therefore expose to more air - though it can depend on how often the bottle is opened.  'I believe more than it being opened or not, it depends more on how perfume is stored and the weather conditions,' notes Rajiv Sheth, master perfumer, founder and creative at All Good Scents. Indeed, fragrances are best stored in dark, dry and cool places, so if you want your perfume to last longer, put it in a dark closet or other location that offers those three conditions. Do not keep your perfume in a humid environment like the bathroom or a sun-soaked area like the windowsill.  Can you still wear old perfume? When it comes to wearing older perfumes that may have gone bad, opinions are mixed.  'There is no harm in spaying a turned perfume on your body, except for the fact it will not have the desirable olfactory impact and can colour your clothes,' Sheth says. Even if it doesn't have its original 'olfactory impact,' the scent of an older perfume still might appeal. Jara explains that the top notes - the first impression notes of a scent - are more likely to be off in a fragrance that has gone bad, but that the base and heart (or aka middle) notes will likely be what you remember.  'I buy a lot of vintage perfumes and when I know it has a lot of citruses, I know i'm gonna deal with the bad top notes, but that doesn't mean I have to throw it away,' he says.  'In most cases, the odd or vinegar-like smell is in the top notes and will disappear in a few minutes,' echoes Sheth. 'Very few perfumes will actually go bad overall. This can mostly happen if kept for several years and/or stored in warm or hot places.' Perfumes typically don't have expiration dates, so you have to go with instinct and consider factors like when a bottle was first opened, how it was stored and what ingredients it contains.  'I wouldn't risk using vintage perfume on my skin even if it smells perfect,' McCartney said. 'Some materials - natural and synthetic - have been found to cause skin irritation and their use has been restricted. Some, including natural fig absolute, have been banned. Citrus essential oils contain natural molecules which can oxidise into other materials which are more sensitising, so 'off' perfumes have a higher risk of causing a rash. It's best not to spray them on skin.' She notes that she might consider spritzing vintage perfume onto her clothes, however. Carter advises using 'good and reasonable' judgment before spraying a fragrance you think may have gone bad directly onto your skin.  'Make sure the perfume smells as it previously did,' he says. 'One can perform a patch test to see if skin irritation occurs.' For people with fragrance sensitivity, certain scents can also trigger headaches and breathing problems, so be considerate of others you might be around.  How can you tell if your perfume has gone bad? Perfume that has gone bad will typically change colour, getting darker due to factors like light exposure. 'If the fragrance initially is a lovely golden hue and after a while you notice that it gets darker and more 'rum'-like, that is a good inkling that the fragrance has deteriorated and should not be worn,' Phillips says.  If you aren't sure on the colour front, test the aroma by spraying the perfume on a paper card or on fabric - ideally not your favourite clothes or anything light coloured. With older perfume, the scent can get stronger, but the aroma loses its freshness and takes on a stale quality. 'I am often given old bottles of fragrance to add to my scent library, and I'll always try them on card before deciding whether to keep them or not,' McCartney says. 'It can be just the fragrance in the pump tube which has gone off, so it's worth spraying a few times until the tube is completely clear, to see if the remaining fragrance is still good.' Hammonds advises also taking the type of bottle into consideration.  'For perfume in glass bottles, if you notice a change in colour or chemical makeup (separation or floating particles), trash it!' she says. 'If your fragrance is in an aluminium bottle - which extends the shelf life in most cases as UV rays cannot penetrate and alter the chemical makeup - then spray it and use your best judgment.' And all technical guidelines aside, you shouldn't keep a bottle of perfume if you find the smell to be unpleasant. If it's totally intolerable, find an ethical way to dispose of the fragrance. Never pour perfume down the drain.  'I might use it for room fragrance if it's on the turn but not terrible,' McCartney says. 'But it's best not to wear it.'", "b6c35eebed8d8f3c6448ebcbeeb988f62cf9690d5ae75c83dd080058": "When the pandemic closed schools in March 2020, Joe Wicks stepped in to keep the world active with a daily YouTube workout, titled 'PE with Joe'.  The videos reached more than 100 million people worldwide, proving as popular with adults as they were with kids. And no one was more surprised by the global success than the 36-year-old from Epsom.  More than two years on, Joe (aka The Body Coach) is still receiving messages from people thanking him for improving their mental health, as well as keeping the nation moving. And the experience has led to Wicks reflecting more deeply on his own life experiences.  In a new BBC documentary, Joe Wicks: Facing My Childhood, he speaks about growing up in a household where his parents were impacted by mental illness. His dad used heroin, while his mum struggled with multiple illnesses at different times, including OCD, anxiety and an eating disorder.  'My mum and dad were up and down, up and down my entire life,' he says in the programme. 'I remember being the child in that scenario, being so upset and confused and lost. It was really tough. 'I worry about what impact parents' mental health is having on kids. And how my own childhood is affecting me.'  There follows an illuminating discussion of the reality of living with a parent impacted by mental illness. Here are six things we learned.  1. This is a really widespread issue  Being the child of a parent who's mentally ill can feel incredibly isolating, but the documentary highlights just how common this experience is.  We hear that there are upwards of three million children in the UK living with a parent with mental illness. That's about six children in every class. NHS England and the Centre for Mental Health has forecasted that in the next few years, more than 10 million people will need support for their mental health as a direct result of the pandemic, so this problem is only going to get bigger.  2. Holistic family support is practically non-existent  Wicks visits Our Time, the UK's only charity dedicated specifically to helping children growing up with a parent impacted by mental illness. Children can attend workshops and engage in play-based activities to help them understand their parent's mental health. Crucially, these sessions drive home the message that it's never the child's fault.  Each year, the charity is able to work with 300 families, even though at least three million children could do with this support.  3. We need to talk to kids about mental illness  Wicks reveals that as a child, he thought he wasn't 'good enough' and blamed himself for his father's drug use. He also says his dad's addiction and mum's mental health problems were never directly spoken about at home. He meets Dympna Cunnane, psychologist and founder of Our Time, who says it's a mistake for parents to try to 'hide' their mental illness to protect their children, because children pick up more than you think.  'Children know everything that's going on at home and they worry about their parents. And most children want their parents to be happy,' she explains.  'So if your parents have any mental illness - like OCD, eating disorders, depression and anxiety, or whatever they're experiencing - by not talking about it, it leaves the child feeling confused and maybe even feeling responsible for not being able to make the parent happy or not being able to fix the situation. 'It's often the case that parents have never spoken to their children. But it's that silence that leaves people struggling alone and it leaves children struggling alone.' 4. Kids find different outlets  We hear from Cunnane that children have different responses to living in a home where mental illness is prevalent. Some children show signs of hyperactivity and difficulty concentrating at school - something which Wicks relates to heavily. He describes running five miles to school instead of getting the bus, because 'it was the best way of letting go of all those feelings'.  As he revisits his old school and childhood home, he has difficulty piecing together some memories from his childhood.  'I suppose I've just compartmentalised the feelings and the experiences and blocked it out as best I can,' he says. 'And maybe that's a natural defence mechanism, because why would I want to bring that into my mind? Why would I want to focus on that? Maybe that's just a natural response to stressful traumatic experiences - close it, put it away and don't go there.' 5. Parental mental illness can impact your own outcomes  There's a link between a parent experiencing mental illness and experiencing mental health issues yourself.  We learn that children with mental health disorders are nearly three times more likely to have a parent with poor mental health. We also hear that some children go on to repeat their parents behaviour as adults, while others are able to 'break the cycle'. 'I learned to slam doors because my dad slammed doors. And I learned to punch walls because my dad punched walls,' says Wicks. 'Now as a parent, I don't want to be that person. I'm really trying so hard to break that cycle.' 6. But parents shouldn't feel guilty  A number of parents in the show express the shame attached to mental illness. Wicks' own mum says this is partly what prevented her from getting help for a long time.  'It's the shame, the guilt... protecting you. I think there was a fear element that if social services knew what was going on, social services would get involved and that you would be taken away from me,' she says. 'That really frightened me.' But Wicks says he thinks people who get help are 'the best parents in the world' - something echoed by other children in the programme.  7. Wicks is doing way more than the odd fitness video The Body Coach is fast becoming the wellbeing coach. Although he doesn't profess to be a mental health expert, Wicks receives thousands of DMs per day and always tries to respond to people who've messaged him about their mental health.  We learn that he'll sometimes spend seven or eight hours replying to DMs, but that his inbox his still full. His wife, Rosie, is full of admiration, but is also concerned about the impact on him, because he can't 'save everyone'.  'He has taken on so much that he doesn't really have downtime,' she says. 'Sometimes I think he needs to just have moments to himself.'

And your fave condiment (let's be honest, does anything else topple it?), is going through a bit of a makeover at the moment. Heinz has announced that its iconic ketchup will soon be sold in paper bottles in a bid to have less impact on the planet.  While most of us are used to squeezing our ketchup out of a plastic bottle - or even old-school glass (and we all know the struggle of that), Heinz wants to introduce the paper counterpart as part of the company's long-term plan to make all of its packaging recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025. But if you're worrying these new bottles are going to end up a bit of a soggy mess (think paper straws), don't worry - these folks seem to know what they're doing. The new offering will be made with wood pulp, in partnership with UK plant-based packaging company, Pulpex - which also created a paper bottle for whisky brand Jonnie Walker, so it's not their first rodeo.  The condiment specialist, which also flog us mayonnaise and salad cream, currently uses 30% recycled plastic and recycled caps in its packaging, but hopes to do better in future. Heinz merged with the US-owned Kraft Foods in 2015 to become the Heinz Kraft company, and wants to achieve zero greenhouse emissions by the year 2050. Miguel Patricio, Kraft Heinz CEO, said: 'Packaging waste is an industry-wide challenge that we must all do our part to address.' Patricio added that it was about offering consumers choice. If you're a squeezy ketchup puritan (or a sucker for punishment), the plastic and glass bottles will still be available to buy in stores - at least for the foreseeable.", "33ff8827456b2169725ed3d357813ebd2bab4b17ec824aa3b71ffc29": "Boris Johnson has told the DUP to 'roll up their sleeves' and enter government at Stormont with Sinn Fein. The prime minister also defended government plans to introduce a new law allowing them to unilaterally rip up the Northern Ireland Protocol. Johnson spoke out after talks with the leadership of all five parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly. The DUP has refused to agree a power-sharing deal with Sinn Fein - who are now the largest party at Stormont - unless the Protocol governing trade between Britain and Northern Ireland is redrawn. They are angry that it has led to a customs border in the Irish Sea and last week refused to nominate a speaker, meaning the Assembly is unable to function. Asked if he had made efforts persuade the DUP to join a power-sharing executive, the PM said: 'I think everybody should be rolling up their sleeves and get stuck in to the government of Northern Ireland. 'The province has got so much going for it but you need leadership and you need government. 'So you bet I said to the DUP in particular 'we want to see you back in the executive, we want to see you nominating, we want to see a speaker in the assembly', of course. 'The issue they have is that they object to the operation of the protocol. We don't want to scrap it, but we think it can be fixed.' Foreign secretary Liz Truss will tomorrow unveil legislation which would allow the government to unilaterally over-ride parts of the Protocol which ministers are opposed to. Striking a conciliatory tone, Johnson said he believed it was possible for the UK and EU to agree reforms to the agreement which would make that unnecessary. But he said the legislation was needed as 'insurance' in case a deal could not be reached with Brussels. He said: 'None of the parties - I spoke to all five parties just now - not one of them likes the way it's operating, they all think it can be reformed and improved - from Sinn Fein to SDLP, DUP, all of them. 'The question is how do you do that? We would love this to be done in a consensual way with our friends and partners, ironing out the problems, stopping some of these barriers east-west. 'But to get that done, to have the insurance, we need to proceed with a legislative solution as well.' Speaking after his meeting with the prime minister, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said Johnson needed to back up his words with action. He said: 'The tabling of legislation is words. What I need is decisive action. And that means I want to see the government enacting legislation that will bring the solution that we need. But let's see what the Government are prepared to do.' Donaldson also hit out at Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald, who had earlier claimed the PM's priority was 'placating the DUP'. He said: 'Sinn Fein need to stop this puerile nonsense that they've been engaging in of late, get serious and let's deal with serious issues, instead of this silly approach that they take of attacking everybody who doesn't agree with them. 'The Prime Minister has a duty to resolve these issues, that is why he is here.'", "a19f687968274e3ee16df7bb9d9e620b139cfc18fa7eca221583ab39": "Going to the park and flying high on the swings is one of the happiest experiences of many of our childhoods. But, crucially, it is not a universal experience - for children with disabilities, it's common for many parts of a playground to be inaccessible. So when playgrounds do cater to their needs, it can be a wonderful occasion. This is what happened to Will Calvert, nine, when he first tried out a swing that could accommodate his wheelchair. The swing, which is located in Will's local park in Sunderland, features a detachable ramp that allows wheelchair users to drive in and enjoy the ride. It was remodelled after his aunty Angela lobbied the council for a new wheelchair friendly swing and roundabout to be installed. Will has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, one of a group of inherited genetic conditions that gradually cause the muscles to weaken, leading to increasing levels of disability. When another mum Susanne Driffield, whose son Joe also has the same condition, shared the video of Will's joy on Twitter, people all around the world, responded with hope that more playgrounds could be adapted this way. 'Build inclusive environments! Everyone deserves to experience joy, dignity and agency. And we all deserve to be on the receiving end of those smiles!' Critical Mass, a mobility company in Auckland, New Zealand responded on Twitter. And SpecialBridge, an online social and dating network for people with disabilities, based out of Atlanta, Georgia, tweeted: 'People with disabilities deserve to have opportunities to enjoy life and have fun. We deserve adaptive and inclusive choices. And we deserve your respect. It's that easy,' One Twitter user simply wrote: 'Every park MUST have one.' Driffield, 44, a regional development manager at Muscular Dystrophy UK, says seeing this content should inspire other councils to make the same changes. She met Will through her work with the charity and also revelled in his delight at the swings.  'I was motivated to do this work because of my son who is 12 as he has the same muscle-wasting condition as Will in the video,' she tells HuffPost UK. 'Will's family are huge advocates of the charity and I've got to know them really well and they know my family now, too. 'I feel this should be standard in every play park so children of all abilities can enjoy the park. The smile on Will's face says it all!'  Driffield and her family live in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, which is a long journey from Sunderland, so she wants more of these accessible parks around the UK. 'It would be amazing to have something like this closer,' she adds. 'My son, and Will, have Duchenne muscular dystrophy which is robbing them of the ability to walk and eventually to use their arms and even to breathe. 'That is why something as simple as a laugh on the swings is so important.'", "4046611418e3bca93da9fc7c7734ffc466793f30cd04d3204719272c": "Presumably to gather inspiration from real-life dystopian horrors that continue to abound, Black Mirror has gone three years without releasing new episodes.  But the break is finally over, as the sixth season of the critically acclaimed hit anthology series is currently in development at Netflix, according to Variety, to once again hold up a mirror to our own collective techno-paranoia. The new season will reportedly expand beyond the runtime of season five, which contained only three episodes, but will be 'even more cinematic in scope, with each instalment being treated as an individual film,' a source told the outlet. No additional details about the season, including a release date, have yet to be unveiled by Netflix. The series, created by Charlie Brooker, has only gotten more complex and expensive throughout its run, with each standalone story upping the ante with special effects and increasingly star-studded casts.  After dropping the interactive instalment titled Bandersnatch in 2018, which allowed viewers to shape the outcome of the story, the streamer released three new entries for season five the following year: Striking Vipers, Smithereens and Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too, featuring actors Anthony Mackie, Yahya Abdul-Matteen II, Andrew Scott and Miley Cyrus.  Since then, Brooker expressed some doubt as to whether there was still an appetite for Black Mirror, explaining in May 2020 that he was drawn to comedy at the time. 'At the moment, I don't know what stomach there would be for stories about societies falling apart, so I'm not working away on one of those,' he told Radio Times. 'I'm sort of keen to revisit my comic skill set, so I've been writing scripts aimed at making myself laugh.' But when asked about another season of Black Mirror, he cryptically replied, 'I've been busy, doing things. I don't know what I can say about what I'm doing and not doing.' Behind-the-scenes intellectual property disputes might also be responsible for the delay, as Netflix, which acquired the series following two seasons on Channel 4, only recently retained the licensing rights again. In January 2020, Brooker and producer Annabel Jones departed their production company House of Tomorrow that owns the rights to the series under Endemol Shine Group to start their own venture, Broke & Bones. That company eventually reached a deal with the subsequent rightsholder Banijay, which took over the Endemol Shine Group later that year, to license the show to Netflix, allowing for future episodes to air on the streamer. Brooker and Jones have also helped launch a pair of year-end specials for Netflix, Death to 2020 and Death to 2021, in addition to the interactive animated film Cat Burglar.", "b89a424676dc565a501528beb7809a1e22ae0f71b1818cec02af4a91": "Heartstopper star Yasmin Finney has joined the cast of Doctor Who.  The actress, who shot to fame as Elle in Netflix's hit LGBTQ+ coming-of-age drama, is set to play the character of Rose in the new era of the BBC series. Yasmin is filming scenes that are due to air in 2023 to coincide with the show's 60 anniversary.  Showrunner Russell T Davies previously announced David Tennant and Catherine Tate would be reprising their roles as The Doctor and his companion Donna Noble for the sci-fi series' milestone episode.  Yasmin's casting also follows the announcement that Sex Education star Ncuti Gatwa is set to take over from Jodie Whittaker as The Doctor for the next series.  Yasmin and Russell had teased her casting on Monday afternoon, as she posted a series of symbols on her Instagram page that have denoted impending Doctor Who announcements over the last few weeks, with Russell commenting: 'Doctor Who's own Heartstopper.' Speaking of joining Doctor Who, Yasmin said: 'If anyone would have told 8 year old Yasmin that one day she'd be part of this iconic show, I would have never in a million years believed them. 'This show has a place in so many people's hearts, so to be seen as a trans actress by the legend himself Russell, has not only made my year, it's made my life. 'I cannot wait to begin this journey and for you all to see how Rose blossoms. Get Ready.' Russell added: 'Life on Doctor Who gets brighter and wilder, how can there be another Rose? You'll find out in 2023, but it's an absolute joy to welcome Yasmin to the Doctor Who set. 'We all fell in love with her in Heartstopper, one of those shows which changes the world - and now Yasmin can change the Whoniverse!' A Doctor Who character called Rose was previously played by Billie Piper, who served as a companion to Christopher Eccleston and David Tennant's versions of The Doctor.  Russell previously teased that the 60th anniversary episode could be a 'missing story. Or a parallel world. Or a dream, or a trick, or a flashback', perhaps going some way as to helping answer the mystery about Yasmin's character.   David Tennant served as the lead in Doctor Who between 2005 and 2010.   He also made a brief return in the special 2013 episode The Day Of The Doctor, in which he shared the screen with his successor, Matt Smith.

'It was a tragedy,' John said in an interview published on Monday in The Guardian. 'But I think it strengthened our resolve and our resilience because we were there for each other. We came out even more sure of who we were as a couple and as a family.'  Chrissy and John, parents to Luna and Miles, experienced the pregnancy loss in September 2020 after she was diagnosed with a partial placental abruption and had to deliver at 20 weeks. The couple said they had named the baby Jack. The couple have been open about their fertility and pregnancy journeys in the past and shared their loss in personal photos. 'It was raw, sharing our experience,' John told The Guardian. 'I was worried but our instinct was to do it because people knew we were pregnant and Chrissy felt like she needed to tell the story completely about what happened.'  The photos -- like anything on the internet -- drew a polarising response, but John said the couple were 'amazed by the outpouring of love and support we felt.'  'We found out how many other families have gone through this,' he said. 'It was a powerful and brave thing that Chrissy did to share that because it made so many people feel like they were seen and that they weren't alone.'  Chrissy, in an essay for Medium in October, explained why she wanted the photos taken and addressed the backlash.  'I cannot express how little I care that you hate the photos,' the supermodel wrote at the time. 'How little I care that it's something you wouldn't have done. I lived it, I chose to do it, and more than anything, these photos aren't for anyone but the people who have lived this or are curious enough to wonder what something like this is like.' 'These photos are only for the people who need them,' she added. 'The thoughts of others do not matter to me.'  Chrissy said in January she'd been sober for six months.

Foreign secretary Liz Truss said the new 'International Development Strategy' would ensure the government can challenge 'malign actors' who use 'patronage, investment and debt as a form of economic coercion and political power'. That is thought to be a reference to China's Belt and Road Initiative, which has been criticised for loading large amounts of debt onto poor countries and coming with political strings attached. Truss said: 'We won't mirror their malign tactics, but we will match them in our resolve to provide an alternative. 'The new strategy, launched today, will ensure that our international development work brings benefit across the globe and here at home. Our strategy will deepen economic, security and development ties globally, while delivering jobs and growth in both the UK and partner countries.' As well as delivering 'honest, reliable investment' and creating new trade partners for Britain, the strategy focuses on support for tackling climate change and global health, providing humanitarian aid and empowering women and girls. But charities criticised the new strategy, and called for the urgent restoration of the government's commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on international aid. Sam Nadel, head of government relations at Oxfam, said: 'While there are some welcome words on the importance of addressing the climate emergency and supporting women and girls, when push comes to shove, this strategy prioritises aid for trade and the financialisation of development. 'It is clearly motivated more by tackling China than tackling poverty.' Stephanie Draper, chief executive of UK aid network Bond, said: 'Though this strategy contains some positive elements, it seems largely driven by short-term political and economic interests rather than the attempt to tackle the root causes of global crises such as inequality, conflict and climate change, which impact us all.' Opposition parties also condemned the Foreign Office plan. Preet Kaur Gill MP, Labour's shadow minister for international development, said: 'Aid for trade simply doesn't work. British people want the aid budget to help those most in need around the world, not horse-traded for favours to big British corporations. 'It's not just bad for those facing famine and conflict - it's short-sighted and wrong. 'If this government was serious about helping the world's poorest, it would start by returning to 0.7 per cent immediately, not in the distant future. Without money behind it, this strategy is barely worth the paper it is written on.' Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran said: 'The Conservative government is trying to run and hide from the devastating impact of their aid cuts. The callous decision to slash aid spending is so scarcely mentioned in the strategy it's like they're pretending it doesn't exist.  'The Conservatives' true strategy on international development is demonstrated by their actions, not their words. Development has been relegated from the cabinet table, the aid budget has been slashed and the UK's proud reputation as a development superpower has been comprehensively trashed.' A Foreign Office spokesperson said: 'The International Development Strategy is about helping partner countries, in particular low income countries, to build their economies sustainably, including through honest, reliable investment in infrastructure and trade. This strategy is not about providing 'tied aid' or aid in return for trade. 'The UK wants to offer a clear alternative to malign actors, so low- and middle-income countries are not burdened with unsustainable debt with strings attached.'", "eec55c622606ab19b2823daff04441cacd06da54f9a99d281f59c3b8": "Blackpool football player Jake Daniels has come out as gay in a historic moment for LGBTQ+ visibility in the British game. The 17-year-old has become the only current openly gay male professional player in the UK. He is also Britain's first male professional footballer to come out publicly since the late Justin Fashanu 32 years ago.  Speaking to Sky News, he said: 'I have been thinking for a long time about how I want to do it, when I want to do it. I know now is the time. I am ready to be myself, be free and be confident with it all. 'I feel like I am ready to tell people my story. I want people to know the real me.' Jake said he first realised he was 'probably five or six years old' when he knew he was gay and said he had spent a long time 'living with the lie'. He said: 'At that age you don't really think that football and being gay doesn't mix. You just think, one day, when I'm older I'll get a girlfriend and I will change and it will be fine. 'But as you get older you realise you can't just change. It doesn't work like that.' Jake praised his team for being 'absolutely amazing' after he came out to them, saying his team mates have 'all been so supportive and everyone has had my back', adding that his captain had told him he was 'so proud' of him. 'Their reaction has been brilliant. It's the best thing I could have asked for,' he said.  Jake also hopes he will be a role model for others to help them come out, adding that he thinks it would 'just be amazing' if a Premier League footballer also comes out.  'I feel like I would have done my job and inspired someone else to do that. I just want it to go up from here. We shouldn't be where we are right now,' he added.

Andrew Bailey said Russia's invasion had led to a global shortage of wheat and cooking oil, which was driving up prices. He said the potential for further food price inflation was a 'major worry' for the central bank. 'Ukraine and Russia is the big risk in a way,' he told the Treasury select committee. 'One is the risk of a further energy price shock, which would come from the cutting off of gas and distillates, such as products like diesel. 'And then, the one which I might sound rather apocalyptic about, is food. 'Two things the [Ukrainian] finance minister said is that there is food in store but they can't get it out.

The Bank of England has forecast a sharp slowdown in UK growth in the latter part of 2022 and has increased interest rates to one per cent in a bid to dampen rising inflation. It also recently made significant alterations to its inflation forecasts, predicting that it will hit 10 per cent this year.  However, there is growing frustration among Tory MPs and ministers that the Bank of England did not move quickly enough to attempt to curb soaring inflation. Some Cabinet ministers have 'turned on' the bank and suggested it is failing to 'get things right', according to the Sunday Telegraph. Senior ministers told the paper the bank had one job to do to 'keep inflation at around two per cent' while another said government figures were 'now questioning its independence'. Bailey told MPs he did not believe the central bank could have acted differently, adding: 'As you say, there have been a series of supply shocks and most recently with the impact of the war, Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 'We can't predict things like wars - that's not in anybody's power. 'I don't think we could have done anything differently; we could not have seen a war with Ukraine. 'There is also a further leg of Covid, with the situation in China, which appears to be affecting the country more seriously.'", "597ff6dda53476bf919ef7cd122688b8899d8ae9b2b4a2a38625361d": "Martin Lewis surprised his Twitter following when he revealed how he had lashed out in a meeting with Ofgem on Monday. As the founder of the Money Saving Expert website, Lewis revealed that he called Ofgem's recently proposed changes to energy bills a 'fucking disgrace' during a meeting with the energy regulator. Lewis has developed a reputation for providing sound financial advice to help every household in recent years, and has become a measured - and neutral - voice amid the political ire, meaning his outburst was all the more surprising. He explained what happened in the tense meeting in a Twitter thread, where he wrote: 'I'd like to formally apologise to the Ofgem staff for losing my rag in a background briefing just now and saying its changes are a 'fucking disgrace that sells consumers down the river'. 'I should've behaved better. My ire's institutional not individual, it was inappropriate.' Back in April, Ofgem raised the cap on energy bills (to a record PS1,971) meaning the average household's annual bill would be increased by PS700. It was one of the defining moments which pushed the country into the current cost of living crisis. Now, Ofgem has suggested energy price hikes should become smaller, but more frequent - meaning reviews would happen every three months instead of every six. Explaining just why this infuriated him, Lewis tweeted: 'I lost it when getting briefed about today's proposals, where it feels like at every turn, in these desperate times where lives are at risk, it has ignored all asks for consumers and instead kowtowed to the industry (I hope history proves me wrong).' He continued to explain his 'breaking point' came when he heard that Ofgem was planning to 'stop the harmful effects of competition - rather than follow the proposed market stabilisation charge'. Lewis said this meant Ofgem's aim was to effectively stop firms undercutting the price cap, in the hope of preventing other companies from leaving the market altogether. 'I finished the call by asking it to at least consider cutting standard charges, which huge rates stop people really saving by cutting energy use.' He said without these changes, there would be 'dire consequences for consumers', and that the energy industry 'must do more to make things better for them'. 'I have had good meetings with Ofgem for years, so I'm sorry this blew up (they were calm, I wasn't). 'Please accept that was (and this is) an emotional rant, not a considered piece.' The money-saving expert later told LBC's James O'Brien that he tweeted about what happened in this industry meeting, which is usually not broadcast, because it is an 'unprecedented time'. Although Lewis was evidently regretful over his outburst, Twitter was on his side in an instant:", "c16d591d82ad32aafa433f88b03bf7a52d1ea8689955fd2e815eca83": "", "66eb22c0ea4d32911170d67d914901809beb926dfcb1a8107fac6eb1": "He may have nabbed the silver medal at the Eurovision final on Saturday night, but UK entrant Sam Ryder could potentially be about to come in first in his latest musical battle. Following Sam's success in Turin, it was revealed on Sunday that his song Space Man was on course to chart at number eight in this week's UK singles chart. This would mark the first top 10 for a UK Eurovision song since Scooch's Flying The Flag (For You), but it turns out the song is even more popular with British music fans than first thought. On Monday, the Official Charts Company shared a second update on the impending chart, revealing Sam had been boosted up five positions to the number three slot overnight, making him a real contender for this week's number one. Just two artists, Harry Styles and Cat Burns, stand in between Sam and the coveted number one position, with only 340 sales in between the Space Man and Go singers. Excitingly, at the time of writing, Sam is also sitting at the top of both the UK Spotify and iTunes charts. Bookmakers Coral has also said its odds of Ryder reaching number one had continued to increase, and are currently at 1/2. However, the OCC has noted that if the Tik Tok star does want to topple Harry Styles - whose hit As It Was has been at the top of the charts for the past six weeks - he'll need to 'sustain his current momentum', which has been building since his performance on Saturday night for the rest of the week. If he does manage to top the UK singles charts, it'll be the first Eurovision song to do so since Gina G's Ooh Aah... Just A Little Bit, which competed back in 1998. At this year's Eurovision Song Contest, Sam's Space Man was named as the international juries' top entrant of the year, though televoting pushed the Ukrainian group Kalush Orchestra to the top of the scoreboard with their song Stefania. His second-place finish gave the UK our best Eurovision result in over 20 years, and he unsurprisingly received a hero's welcome after returning from Italy on Sunday.

Speaking at a Nato meeting on Sunday, secretary general Jens Stoltenberg placed his unwavering faith in Ukraine. He explained: 'Russia's war in Ukraine is not going as Moscow had planned. 'They failed to take Kyiv. They are pulling back from around Kharkiv. Their major offensive in Donbas has stalled. 'Russia is not achieving its strategic objectives. Ukraine can win this war.' While it's clear that the Kremlin has been falling short of its goals ever since it launched its invasion back in February, it's remained uncertain whether the Ukrainian resistance was strong enough to fully push Russia back. Updates from the UK Ministry of Defence have repeatedly suggested that the Russian president Vladimir Putin's forces are losing morale, troops and equipment as the war drags on - it's believed Russia has lost around a third of its ground forces in the last three months. It does still hold the port city of Mariupol but hundreds of Ukrainian troops are still refusing to surrender and are hiding in the steelworks, preventing Putin from claiming complete victory there. The MoD has also said: 'Under the current conditions, Russia is unlikely to dramatically accelerate its rate of advance over the next 30 days.' On top of Russia's failures on the ground, the international ramifications of the invasion will infuriate the Kremlin too. It's well-known that one of the reasons Putin invaded Ukraine is out of fear the country could join Nato, as it becomes more aligned with the west - a move which Russia thought could leave it alienated. Since the war began, Sweden and Finland have confirmed they are now looking to join Nato too, for protection - another own goal for Putin. However, there have been questions around how the west defines 'winning' for Ukraine in the war. In its most hopeful definition, this would mean pushing Russia out of all Ukrainian land, including the peninsula of Crimea which it annexed in 2014. Alternatively, the Ukrainian forces could settle with reclaiming all of its land aside from Crimea, or even allow the self-claimed rebel republics Donetsk and Luhansk to stay with Russia. Last month, Tory MP Tobias Ellwood told Radio 4's Today programme: 'The bigger question, not answered by Nato or indeed us, is what does success look like?  'We are doing enough to prevent Ukraine from losing but not enough to ensure they win.  'So what does our long-term mission objective look like? Is it pushing Russia back to pre-February lines or is it liberating the entire Donbas region? That's absolutely critical in how we choose to up-arm the Ukrainians.' There's also a question mark hanging over whether Putin would actually be willing to give up and pull back from the war without some form of victory. An intervention from Russia's ally Belarus could also change the direction the war is currently heading in. The Ministry of Defence explained in its latest update that Belarus is now joining the war effort to distract the Ukrainian advances, and prevent them from reclaiming the Donbas region. Even so, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has promised that his country will be safe enough to host Eurovision 2023, following the nation's victory in the song contest over the weekend. He said: 'Step by step, we are forcing the occupiers to leave the Ukrainian land.'", "c9e8f58020fbf93bc89085bee5c3f47fe4c4e0819a5d3563c8a0ec2c": "You're reading Life-Work Balance, a series aiming to redirect our total devotion to work into prioritising our personal lives. What's your dream job? Many of us have an idealised notion of what the perfect workplace would be like. Flexible working, a four-day work week, an outrageous salary? While there are certainly perks that mitigate the conditions of work, we can also ask whether it's our dream...to work? Given the choice, most of us would love to have more time to pursue the things that bring us actual joy and not worry about our professional endeavours, our performance, pay, and the day-to-day gripes of employment.  Really, our work should be a complementary part of our lives - something that has purpose, allows us to use problem-solving skills, make connections - but that doesn't bulldoze over everything else.  Instead, much of our lives are dominated by work - it's often the first thing we ask about when we meet someone new. But what if we stopped talking about 'dream jobs' and instead, overhauled our attitudes to aspire to something bigger than labour?  It can be hard to reset your thinking on this, so if you're someone who's constantly hustling for their next career move, it can be useful for hear from those who've managed to land their 'dream roles', because it doesn't always turn out dreamy. Londoner Shaima*, 27, who works in film, can relate to this. After acquiring a job with her dream company, she was shocked to realise it was a dud. 'I started working for a creative and cultural landmark for British film and the film industry which was a dream. They are known across the film industry and fund people's dreams of being a filmmaker through their grants. But for me it was a horrible experience with the way a creative, cultural institute is so obsessed with hierarchy and playing rank at every chance.' Shaima cites bureaucracy and rigid HR structures that made life difficult. 'Since it's a government funded organisation, they have a lot of red tape and the simplest of tasks becomes a huge chore,' she says.  Unfortunately, Shaima, who still works for the company, has given up on trying to change things. 'I have experienced gaslighting and painful HR processes that I have given up on challenging following a year of grief and pandemic hardships,' she says. For others, what was once considered a dream job failed to materialise, but they've established a happy medium between work ambition and outside work fulfilment.  Despite working in a career which she aspired to since her youth, associate editor Sam says she's realised there are more important things in life instead of constantly chasing thankless roles. 'I always knew I wanted to be a magazine journalist,' she tells HuffPost. 'And I worked hard in various unpaid internships. I was always proactive in doing all the right things to get there, so when I landed a role at a big magazine I was thrilled.' But the job, which changed to a branded content role based on precarious shifts, wasn't fulfilling for Sam who also dealt with a difficult boss.  'With a bully for a manager, I needed to make a change, so I put in for a part-time contract to allow me to freelance on the side,' she says. 'While I'd love to be full-time freelance, it's not practical with a mortgage and the state of my mental health, so the fact that the role pays my mortgage while I get to write the things I really care about on the side is a happy medium.' The perfect job, if the cliche is to be believed, is one that 'doesn't feel like work' at all. But let's get real: no one actually dreams of labour. If tomorrow money was no longer a factor, how many of us would stay in the traditional workforce?  Sure, work is a thing that has to be done if we want to live in a smooth-running society. But perhaps we ought to remove associations of work as the ideal and dream bigger.  *Names have been changed.

The Labour leader has pledged to resign if issued a fixed penalty notice over the so-called beergate row. Police are investigating whether Starmer broke the law by eating curry in an MP's office with staff after a day of campaigning for the local elections in April 2021. In an interview with ITV's Loose Women on Monday, the Labour leader said he had put 'everything on the line' because it was the 'right thing to do'. Starmer said the accusation made against him was entirely different from the 'industrial rule breaking' taking place in Downing Street. Boris Johnson has already been issued one fine for breaking his own Covid rules, but has rebuffed demands that he step down as prime minister. 'I'm very clear I haven't broken the rules,' Starmer said. 'But equally I've said if the police do issue me with a FPN I will do the right thing and I will step down. 'I've put everything on the line because I think that's the right thing to do. That's the complete opposite of the prime minister.' He added: 'I haven't broken the rules. I am sure that's going to be the finding.' Starmer found out Durham Police had reopened its investigation into him on Friday May 6, as he was celebrating local election victories. It was not until Monday that he called a press conference to announce his intention to quit should he be fined. But he told ITV it was his 'instinct' to make that move 'as soon' as the police made their announcement. 'In my heart I knew what I was going to say,' he said. 'There was no way I wasn't going to say that.' 'As soon as I knew there was a reinvestigation, I knew I was going to say that because that was so deep down inside me as to what I believed.' It is still not clear if Starmer would quit if police find he had breached the rules but do not issue a fine.  At the time of the event, the ban on indoor mixing between households remained in place. But there was an exemption for 'work purposes', and Labour has said Starmer simply legitimately took a break from work to eat.

Boris Johnson headed to Belfast on Monday morning to try and thrash out a solution with local parties, but as Brussels digs its heels in, it's not clear if a clean resolution is possible. With worries over a possible trade war and further potential divisions in Northern Ireland, here's everything you need to know about the post-Brexit EU-UK agreement which has come back to haunt politics. What is the Northern Ireland protocol? Back in 2019 when the UK was trying to negotiate the terms of its post-Brexit relationship with the EU, no-one could agree on what to do about Northern Ireland. It is the only part of the UK with an EU border, as it neighbours the Republic of Ireland. The bloc has strict trade rules and, as the UK was going to be treated as a third non-EU country after Brexit, any goods coming from it and going into the bloc need to be checked. Both sides were also keen to honour the 1998 Good Friday agreement by avoid putting up a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Johnson subsequently put forward the Northern Ireland Protocol where there would essentially be a trade border down the Irish Sea - something he had previously insisted would not happen. Goods could pass over the Irish border easily, because Northern Ireland would continue to follow the EU's trade rules - despite leaving the EU along with the rest of the UK. But, goods coming from Britain and entering Northern Ireland would have to be checked. So, what's gone wrong? Unionists have argued from the beginning that the protocol would split Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, cause huge trade delays and food shortages. The Democratic Unionists, (DUP), the largest unionist party, have insisted the Protocol must be redrawn to prevent Northern Ireland being treated differently from the rest of the UK. They have said that until this is done, they will not enter into a power-sharing government at Stormont with Sinn Fein, which gained the largest number of seats at the recent Northern Ireland election and supports the Protocol.  It is also worth noting that the Protocol has not even been fully implemented yet. As we are still in the grace period of the initial agreement, more restrictions are expected to be introduced in the months ahead unless it is substantially altered.  Does Downing Street agree with the DUP? Even though Johnson signed up to the Protocol as part of the withdrawal agreement struck when the UK left the EU, he has now sided with the unionists and insisted it must be changed. He pointed out in his piece in the Belfast Telegraph on Sunday, 'there is no disguising the fact that the delicate balance created in 1998 has been upset'. He added that the unionists of Northern Ireland feels their identity to being threatened by the current arrangement. 'We cannot allow the impression that one strand is deemed more important than others; or that EU custom codes - designed for vast container ships coming from Shanghai to Rotterdam, not supermarket lorries from Liverpool to Belfast - somehow trump everything else,' the prime minister explained. He also noted that medical testing and medicine access in Northern Ireland is a particular cause for concern in the post-Covid era. Northern Ireland is not part of the same tax and VAT arrangements as the rest of the UK either, so the country is not receiving the same help from central government as the rest of the UK, according to the prime minister. Johnson then took aim at the EU over the challenges, saying: 'We have been told by the EU that it is impossible to make the changes to the Protocol text to actually solve these problems in negotiations -- because there is no mandate to do so.' However, he has been heavily criticised for blaming others when he did actually agree to the Protocol himself. How does the UK want to resolve it? The UK wants to get rid of checks and paperwork between Britain and Northern Ireland.  Downing Street also wants to ensure British goods which do not then travel outside of the Northern Ireland only need to meet British standards, as well as removing the European Commission and European Court of Justice's authority over the protocol. Johnson has called for general willingness from the EU to help, pointing out: 'We must remember that all parties to the Protocol made a commitment to be willing to revisit, adapt and change these arrangements over time -- and to protect the internal market of the UK.' But, the prime minister has also warned that if the EU does not change its position, 'there will be necessity to act'. What does the EU think? In short - it doesn't really want to change anything. It has refused to renegotiate the contents of the protocol, and wants extra safeguarding for things going into the Republic. The EU has also claimed that the UK has breached international law by delaying the moment when the protocol comes into full force. Ireland's foreign minister Simon Coveney said: 'My message to the British government is crystal clear -- to act unilaterally to break international law, to not respect the democratic decisions in Northern Ireland would make matters significantly worse not better in terms of trying to solve the problems of the protocol.' He added that the UK is in for a 'very difficult summer' if it overrides the protocol. But, he also told POLITICO that the EU is prepared to move on the unionists' main demand, reducing checks on goods coming into Northern Ireland from Britain. The EU also wants the UK to share more data on the goods coming from Britain, along with an 80% reduction in checks on food products arriving in Northern Ireland. It has suggested halving the paperwork, reducing the customs informations firms need to provide, allowing trade in medicine between Britain and Northern Ireland to continue and relaxing rules so chilled meats can be sent across the Irish Sea. But, the UK said these suggestions only 'worsen the current trading arrangements'. Why is this week set to be particularly important? Downing Street will outline a more detailed assessment on what will happen with the Protocol 'in the coming days', once the prime minister has discussed the situation with local parties. Coveney will meet European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic too, this week and speak to foreign secretary Liz Truss. Truss will announce a new law to override parts of the protocol on Tuesday - a move which will undoubtedly spark a fierce response from Brussels. The government has repeatedly said 'no option is off the table' and even threatened to trigger Article 16, an element of the original deal which allows either side to completely suspend the agreement. Yet this could trigger EU retaliation and a trade war.  Former prime minister Theresa May also warned that this could damage the UK's reputation telling her colleagues in the Commons: 'What such a move would say about the UK and its willingness to abide by treaties which it has signed.' Should we be worried about the rising tensions? Protests in Northern Ireland have been increasing since 2021, along with sporadic street violence. Europe minister James Cleverly told the Commons European Scrutiny Committee at the end of April: 'Everyone in government is really focused on making sure we don't see Northern Ireland slip back into violence at all. 'We feel that this is one of the things we should address to prevent that happening.' It also looks unlikely that a trade war will kick off any time soon.  Truss' potential announcement about taking on the protocol would take weeks before it passed into law, which allows for some much needed negotiation time. Ireland's Coveney also said: 'The last thing the EU needs or wants right now is tension with the UK, but if the British government decides to move forward with unilateral action which will not reflect the majority view in Northern Ireland, that will of course be a huge problem for the EU.' The US is also looking for 'this to be resolved without any theatre around it', according to Conor Burns, the PM's Northern Ireland envoy to the States.", "c352342aa9fdcf2b7741de04ca0b1b8e663c46d27d40f589b84fcdee": "The Cabinet Office is refusing to say how much was spent on a 'custom built' wardrobe made for a former top aide of Boris Johnson. In January it was reported that Dan Rosenfield, the former Downing Street chief of staff, had 'insisted' on having a wardrobe put in his office and one was 'custom built overnight'. HuffPost UK submitted a Freedom of Information request on January 10 asking how much the wardrobe cost and what make or brand it was. The Cabinet Office spent nearly four months debating whether they should release the details. The FoI team came back three times confirming that they held the information, but each time claimed they needed to delay their response by 20 working days. They said the information could prejudice the commercial interests of a person and they needed more time to consider whether it passed the public interest test.  'The Cabinet Office has not yet reached a decision on whether the balance of the public interest favours disclosure of this information,' they wrote.  Separately, The Spectator was also pursuing the costs via FoI. Eventually HuffPost UK submitted a complaint to the Information Commissioner's Office, after which the Cabinet Office shut down the case once and for all, citing 'data protection' reasons. They claimed: 'We consider that there would be no overriding legitimate interest or necessity in disclosure that overrides the reasonable expectations of privacy of the individual concerned.' In their FoI response, the Cabinet Office said they had a 'duty of care' both to employees and former employees. They insisted that Rosenfield had 'no personal involvement' in the purchase of any such item.  'We would note that the former staff member had no personal involvement in either the procurement or the purchase of any such item,' they said.  The Cabinet Office press office has also declined to comment on the story or answer HuffPost UK's questions about the wardrobe.  Earlier this year a source told The Sunday Times Rosenfield 'insisted' that a custom built wardrobe was found for his office.  The source told the newspaper: 'He insisted on having a wardrobe put in his office so he had somewhere to hang his suits, because he cycles in. When a wardrobe was found, he didn't like it, so he insisted something was custom-built overnight. 'Facilities moved heaven and earth to sort it out; the next morning he was angry because his office smelt of wood stain.' Liberal Democrat MP Sarah Olney said: 'This government has gone from scandal to sleaze and almost everywhere in-between. 'Now we're seeing even more skeletons come out of the closet and this time it's custom-built at the cost of the taxpayer. 'While millions of families and pensioners struggle with a crippling cost of living emergency, the Cabinet Office are shelling out cash for fancy wardrobes. 'Yet again, the government have proved they are out of touch with the British people - they should at least confess and tell us how much has been spent.' Rosenfield resigned amid an exodus of Downing Street staff in February this year.  It came amid a shakeup of No.10 as the partygate allegations engulfed the government.  Repeated attempts to contact Rosenfield through the Cabinet Office were unsuccessful, as were attempts to reach him through a family member and other organisations.", "fc4764e0afd95e4b568cc335ff2234b857f50ec6ee31b744308b5bdc": "    The women of Twitter never fail to brighten our day with their brilliant and succinct wit.

The prime minister's official spokesman said the supporters' behaviour was 'a great shame'. The Duke of Cambridge was also jeered by Liverpool fans ahead of the team's victory over Chelsea.  At a briefing for journalists this morning, the spokesman was asked about comments by Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, who said: 'In this situation the best question is 'why does this happen?' The people do not do it for no reason. Maybe we should ask this question?' Asked if the PM agreed, the spokesman said: 'No. It was a great shame that as we were marking 150 years of the FA cup, an event that brings people together, that a small minority chose to act in that way.' Prince William, president of the Football Association, was met by loud jeers when he was introduced to both teams before kick-off. Liverpool supporters also drowned out singer-songwriter RAYE's rendition of God Save The Queen and the traditional cup final hymn Abide With Me. The boo, just weeks before the Queen celebrates her Platinum Jubilee, drew fierce criticism from across the political divide. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle told The Mail on Sunday: 'I utterly condemn any fans who booed Prince William at Wembley. 'The FA Cup final should be an occasion when we come together as a country. It should not be ruined by a minority of fans' totally shameful behaviour. In this year of all years - the Queen's Platinum Jubilee - this is dreadful.'

During Monday's show, Phillip left his co-host stunned during a chat with special effects artist Matthew Mungle with one particular remark.  The presenters were discussing with Matthew how he had made a prosthetic penis for Chris Hemsworth when he was shooting the film Vacation in 2015.  As a picture of Chris showing off the appendage in a pair of boxer shorts flashed on screen, Phillip remarked: 'Obviously, if you were going to do something like that, it would be nice if you could do it with your own. 'If you are deciding that you're not going to do it with your own and you're going to do it with a prosthetic, I'd want a proper schlong.' His admission prompted a giggle from Holly as she then held her hand up to her mouth in shock.  'You bet!' Matthew replied. 'I mean that's usually what they want - a bigger schlong... maybe bigger testicles too.' 'It's quite the wishlist,' Holly remarked.  Matthew then revealed the Marvel star took his prosthetic penis home and 'put it on his mantlepiece with his Thor hammers, so he's got both hammers together'.  'Not to mix those two up ever,' Holly laughed.  Elsewhere in the interview, Phil and Holly struggled to compose themselves when Matthew rattled off a list of X-rated questions he has to ask film bosses when creating each penis.

Conversations With Friends is finally here, and between the meaningful looks and long, long silences, there's a plot more poignant than anyone's love story. In the latest Sally Rooney adaptation, we meet socially awkward Frances (played by newcomer Alison Oliver) during the week of her period, where she's shown heating a water bottle and writhing on the bathroom floor in pain.  As the series progresses, so do her symptoms, to the point where she goes to A&E after losing a lot of blood, in what her mother identifies as a possible miscarriage. But it turns out she was never pregnant and after running some tests, doctors diagnose her with endometriosis - a painful condition where tissue similar to the lining of the womb starts to grow in other places.  This on-screen representation is a huge moment for the 1.5 million people in the UK living with the condition, many of whom have had to fight for a diagnosis.  But while it's great to see endo finally highlighted on screen, the TV show (understandably) can't tell us everything about the condition. Endometriosis symptoms vary from person to person, so while some sufferers (like Frances) experience flare ups around the time of their period, others can be impacted by symptoms at other times of the month.  The fact that Frances gets a diagnosis within 12 episodes - representing one single summer - is also a far cry from the experience of the majority of women, who wait, on average, a painful eight years for a diagnosis.  So, here's what else you need to know about endo that didn't quite make it into the drama.  What is endometriosis?  In the show, we learn that endometriosis is a condition where 'cells from inside the uterus grow elsewhere in the body'. Endometriosis UK, the leading charity on the condition, shares a little more info that explains what this actually means on its website.  'Each month these cells react in the same way to those in the womb, building up and then breaking down and bleeding. Unlike the cells in the womb that leave the body as a period, this blood has no way to escape,' it explains.  'This can cause inflammation, pain and the formation of scar tissue.' Symptoms of endometriosis  Symptoms of endo can vary from person to person, according to the NHS. However, the most prevalent symptoms are:    Pain in your lower tummy or back (pelvic pain) - usually worse during your period.   Period pain that stops you doing your normal activities   Pain during or after sex   Pain when peeing or pooing during your period   Feeling sick, constipation, diarrhoea, or blood in your pee during your period   Difficulty getting pregnant.    The diagnosis delay  Frances delays seeking help for her endometriosis until her symptoms reach crisis point. However, she's then diagnosed from what seems to be her first ever interaction with doctors. We know this rarely happens for other sufferers.  A 2020 report from the All Party Parliamentary Group on Endometriosis found that it takes eight years on average to get an endometriosis diagnosis.  According to the research - based on a survey of almost 11,00 people, including patients and healthcare practitioners - 58% of people visited a GP more than 10 times before diagnosis and 43% saw doctors in hospital more than five times. Around 90% said they would have liked access to psychological support but were never offered it, and 35% had a reduced income due to endometriosis. The report also highlighted the specific barriers faced by women of colour in accessing adequate care. 'Although there are commonalities for everyone affected by endometriosis with regards to misdiagnosis and lengthy diagnosis times, we know that there are health disparities and those from black, Asian, and minority ethnic communities can receive a lower quality of care,' the report said. 'More needs to be done on this in respect to endometriosis diagnosis, treatment and care.'  Endo can impact your sex life  On the one hand, it's great to see someone with a chronic illness enjoying their sex life in Conversations With Friends. And - just like Normal People which came before it - there's a lot of sex in the show.  But the focus is on penetrative sex when in reality, this can be tricky for some endo sufferers.  Tabitha Britt, founding editor of DO YOU ENDO, a magazine on living with endometriosis, has previously written for HuffPost on this topic.  She recalled 'wincing in pain and wishing it would end' during penetrative sex with her husband, until she revealed to him how painful it was. Her husband was horrified and they've now adapted their sex routine to utilise toys, massage and making things 'even more exciting than 'going all the way''.  'Before my diagnosis, I couldn't have sex without feeling inadequate and heartbroken,' she wrote. 'Once I came to terms with the fact that I'll have to deal with chronic illness for the rest of my life, we adapted, made small changes and things became easier. They became easier because I realised I needed to accept myself: burning urethra, endo-belly, and all.'", "bbf94cac5f49dd7e858a4d8dafb3bc6c67e7045a71f8759e24957a1a": "As the dust settles and the last of the confetti is swept up after Saturday night's Eurovision Song Contest final, attention is already turning to next year's competition, particularly given who ended up winning the show. It was a mammoth victory for Ukraine over the weekend, with Kalush Orchestra sweeping up an incredible 631 points at the end of the night. This was thanks in no small part to viewers showing their support in the phone votes, with every country involved giving Ukraine points in the televote. With Stefania officially this year's winning song, and the conflict in Ukraine still ongoing, talk has now begun about exactly how Eurovision will take shape in 2023. Here's what we know so far... First of all, here's some quick history about Ukraine in the Eurovision Song Contest As far as Eurovision goes, Ukraine is actually a bit of a newcomer, only debuting in the competition in 2003, and making a subsequent 17 appearances (they were absent in 2015 and 2019, both for reasons relating to the country's ongoing conflict with Russia). In that time, they've racked up three wins. During their sophomore Eurovision in 2004, Ruslana's Wild Dances secured the victory, while Jamala's poignant rendition of her song 1944 triumphed in 2016.  Jamala's song is significant as its title references the year of the forced deportation of Crimean Tatar people during the reign of Joseph Stalin. The chorus of 1944 also features lyrics in Crimean. Even in the years they've not won, Ukraine are known for consistently making a huge splash at Eurovision, with some of their more iconic entries including runners up Verka Serduchka's Dancing Lasha Tumbai and Ani Lorak's Shady Lady, as well as Go_A's Shum and Svetlana Loboda's Be My Valentine! (Anti-Crisis Girl).  What have Eurovision organisers said about next year's competition? Following Ukraine's victory on Saturday night, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) who help put Eurovision together every year issued a statement insisting that the country will be given first refusal on whether they want to host in 2023, as is standard for a winning entry. 'We congratulate Ukraine and Kalush Orchestra on their win and superb performance,' they said, noting that they would soon 'begin planning for 2023 with winning broadcaster UA:PBC'. While they acknowledged the 'unique challenges involved in hosting next year's competition', they said they would be as in any other year, 'discussing all the requirements and responsibilities involved in hosting the competition with UA:PBC, and all other stakeholders, to ensure we have the most suitable setup for the 67th Eurovision Song Contest'. The EBU had no further comment when contacted by HuffPost UK, but said they would update fans on the situation 'in due time'. President Zelenskyy has also insisted he wants to see the competition return to Ukraine in 2023 After two previous Eurovision finals were held in Kyiv, Zelenskyy has said he wants Ukraine to host the show next year. 'Our courage impresses the world, our music conquers Europe!' he said (via Deadline). 'We will do our best to one day host the participants and guests of Eurovision in Ukrainian Mariupol. Free, peaceful, rebuilt! I am sure our victorious chord in the battle with the enemy is not far off.'  Mariupol is almost entirely in Russian hands aside from a stalwart group of a few hundred Ukrainian fighters who continue to hold out in a steel factory. Zelensky's optimistic statement came as Russian troops are retreating from Kharkiv, the country's second largest city, after bombarding it for weeks, and Moscow's forces continue to engage in a grinding battle for the country's eastern industrial heartland.  Zelenskyy's comments have also been echoed by Kalush Orchestra Frontman Oleg Psyuk said at a Eurovision press conference: 'If the president said it's going to happen, then it's going to happen. We will host Eurovision in a newly rebuilt and happy Ukraine. He congratulated us and he is happy we won.' The group was given special permission to leave the country to compete in Eurovision in Italy, although one of its members, Vlad Kurochka, made the decision to stay behind in Ukraine. Kalush Orchestra will return to Ukraine on Monday, where Oleg will go back to running a volunteering organisation. 'It is chaos,' he said of the current situation. 'It's like a sick lottery with all those missiles. 'I am going back to Ukraine, I run the volunteering organisation, we help people with accommodation, transportation, medication, whatever is needed so I am just going to keep doing that.' Oleg added: 'We haven't really celebrated yet. We will probably have a big celebration after the war because victory is great, winning Eurovision is fantastic but there is just so much stuff going on. 'People are getting killed in the war or they fight in the war or lose their jobs in Ukraine, it is not really the best backdrop for celebrations.' If Ukraine can't host in 2023, what happens then? There are actually a few different options. Traditionally, when a winning country has been unable to host the following year, it's been the runner up who has stepped in. This could potentially mean Eurovision returning to UK soil for the first time since 1998, albeit under far less jubilant circumstances. In 1960 and 1974, the competition was held in the runner-up country rather than the winner - and in both of those cases, this meant the UK played host to the contest. In fact, the UK has more second-place finishes than any country in Eurovision history, a record that has now been extended by Sam Ryder. Other broadcasters have already spoken out about hosting, too Since Ukraine's win, the national broadcasters for Spain and Sweden - both of whom placed within the top 5 in 2022 - have said they would be willing to host the competition (Sweden pointed out that they last held Eurovision in 2016, and so are well-versed in what it takes to host the contest in the modern era). Italy has also said they'd be happy for the contest to be held in Turin for the second year in a row, though quite how that would go down with fans remains to be seen...", "0e84683713b70f2728ffc9a1ddc9e5cef9067866af1c952b5cbb8b1c": "The energy price cap could soon be examined every three months under plans announced by the industry regulator. Ofgem disclosed that it was putting the idea out to consultation after criticism that the current twice-yearly adjustment arrangement - in April and October - has led to the failure of suppliers last year at the peak of wholesale gas prices.  'Today's proposed change would mean the price cap is more reflective of current market prices and any price falls would be delivered more quickly to consumers,' said Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley. What is a price cap? The energy price cap is the mechanism that controls the gas and electricity bills for 22 million households. It's the maximum amount that companies can charge consumers per unit of energy.  The price cap is credited with preventing families from the worst of the Covid-linked rises in raw energy prices, by preventing companies from passing on unparalleled increases to their customers. However, Ofgem increased the price cap in April, meaning households saw average bills rising by 54% or PS693 annually, with energy bills now costing a yearly average of PS1,971 per household. Why are energy prices rising? There are various reasons why energy prices are increasing. The pandemic has played a large role in this. The price of gas has risen globally. This is due to global energy consumption decreasing dramatically during the pandemic as businesses shut down and traffic virtually disappeared. But since the bounce back and as things began opening up, the demand for energy has soared exponentially.  Increased demand from China as well - which saw a sticky hot summer, amping up the need for air conditioners - also affected the situation.  While other countries are also experiencing similar problems, the UK is hard hit as it is one of the biggest users of natural gas - 85% of British homes have gas central heating. Why is a price cap review being introduced? Currently, the price cap is only reviewed twice a year (in April and October). However, the proposed plan would make this more frequent.  Bills could rise to almost PS2,600 in October when the next price cap adjustment is due because of the impact of Russia's war in Ukraine, according to the latest forecasts. Changing the price cap more often will make it more reflective of international gas prices, taking some pressure off suppliers, Ofgem says.  Ofgem said it's plan would encourage great agility: allowing bills to rise or decline faster. But it's chief executive admitted during an interview with Sky News that the next movement would be upward. 'A more frequent price cap would reflect the most up to date and accurate energy prices and mean when prices fall from the current record highs, customers would see the benefit much sooner,' the regulator said in a statement. Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley added: 'Our top priority is to protect consumers by ensuring a fair and resilient energy market that works for everyone.'  When will this be introduced? The plan will bring in the changes from October so households would see no effects from an update until January 1 2023 under the new plans, Ofgem said.  'Remember that the total cost you pay over the year would be absolutely the same, because that reflects only the cost of the energy that we buy,' Brearley told Sky News. 'Yes, the price would go up more quickly as prices go up, but equally importantly as those prices come down, then the price cap comes back down again.'

Instead of going with the continuity of the Bridgerton novels, season three of the hit Netflix show will see the love story between Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton) and Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan) taking centre stage.  The news was revealed at Netflix's NYSEE panel on Sunday. Nicola also shared the news with her followers on Instagram, writing: 'Like Lady Whistledown I've been keeping quite a big secret for quite a long time... but I can finally tell you that @bridgertonnetflix Season Three is Colin and Penelope's Story.' The couple follow in the footsteps of Daphne Bridgerton and Simon Bassett (Phoebe Dynevor and Rege-Jean Page) who took the spotlight during the first run, followed by Anthony Bridgerton and Kate Sharma (Jonathan Bailey and Simone Ashley) in the second. In the Bridgerton book series, Colin and Penelope's story is the focus of the fourth novel Romancing Mr Bridgerton. Nicola previously said she is going to ask the makers of Bridgerton to do 'the PG version' of her character's sex scenes when she was to become series lead as she finds the prospect of shooting them 'terrifying'.  'Luke and I, we used to joke about it all the time, and then it becomes progressively less funny and more intimidating as time goes on,' she said.    'I think I'm genuinely and I'm not kidding - going to ask Shondaland for a special family friendly cut. Because I just think it's embarrassing enough watching the scenes that I am not in there like that.'   She continued: 'I'm just sort of like haha, so I think I'm going to put a special request in my contract to be like, can we just get one that's the PG version, like maybe a little kiss and then we're good, because I've read the book.   'So I know that it gets extremely racy in that scene. I know already stuff that's gonna happen. So I'm like, no, we're good. We're fine. It's intense.' The third season of Bridgerton will also see one of the Bridgerton family getting a whole new face, as one of the characters has been recast with a new actor.  Both seasons of Bridgerton are now available to watch on Netflix.

Skyrocketing energy bills, increased national insurance contributions and a 30-year inflation high has meant those hardest-hit have taken to skipping meals to cut bills. The government has been criticised for not doing enough to help. Speaking to Sky News' Kay Burley, Maclean defended the government. 'We have got these short-term pressures on us,' she said. 'Over the long-term we need to have a plan to grow the economy and make sure people are able to protect themselves better whether that is by taking on more hours or moving to a better paid jobs. 'These are long-term actions but that's what we are focused on as a government.' 'You say taking on more hours,' Burley said. 'Some people are working three jobs, they are working every hour that God sends them and they're still going to food banks to get food because they can't afford to feed their kids. 'So it's not as straightforward as that, is it?' 'No of course it's not,' the minister replied. 'And I'm not suggesting that for one moment, but we have often heard in the past when people are facing problems with their budget that one of the problems - and it may not be for everybody - is about being able to take on more hours or move to a better-paid job. 'Of course, it's an individual situation depending on that particular family's situation. 'But that's why the job centres exist, that's why the work coaches exist, that's why we put the support into those job centres to work with individuals to work with those individual situations.' She did then admit: 'Of course, it's not going to work for people who are already working in three jobs. 'That's why we have the other measures that we are putting in place, all the help we are putting into schools, the help with the local authorities, the help and support I've already mentioned. 'This is where we are going to target the help where it's most needed.' However, when she was asked if she wanted to retract these controversial claims an hour later on GB News, Maclean said: 'I think you have taken that slightly out of context.' She claimed these remarks were about getting people back into work after the Covid crisis, as well as enabling them to increase their skillset 'if it's right for them'. Her remarks definitely did not go down well on Twitter.  Labour's shadow economic secretary to the treasury, Tulip Siddiq, also said this claim from Maclean suggested that 'this Tory government could not be more out of touch or out of ideas'. She added: 'As energy bills rise by record amounts for millions of families, comments like this are ridiculous - as is the prime minister's refusal to back a windfall tax on oil and gas producer profits that could tackle the cost of living crisis.' The minister also indicated that there was 'more help' on the way for families hit hardest by the cost of living crisis, although the Treasury dismissed the idea that any emergency budget might be unveiled only last week. The Conservatives have been especially scrutinised for not understanding how difficult the crisis is for those hardest-hit. Tory MP Lee Anderson made headlines after saying people using food banks just needed to learn how to cook and budget - despite the backlash, he doubled down on his claim the following day.", "6be31e4b3e13b2d4023ddc875ca7c40a3e81f6a13bd978af0f70251a": "Home office minister Rachel Maclean struggled to explain the changes to the controversial new stop and search powers just announced by the government during an awkward interview. Home secretary Priti Patel revealed on Monday that she was lifting restrictions on police stop and search in areas where they anticipate violent crime.  Listed in section 60 of the criminal justice and public order act, this means officers can search people and look for weapons without reasonable grounds in certain areas. Restrictions on these controversial powers were initially introduced back in 2014 because stop and search was criticised for the disproportionate impact it had on people of colour. Lifting these police limitations is not expected to go down well, especially as they come at a time when the government is already being accused of not looking after people during the cost of living crisis. LBC's Nick Ferrari then locked horns with a minister on Monday over what these changes actually will do. He asked: 'How long is a section 60 in place for?' Maclean said there were various periods set out in the paperwork, but that she 'thinks' the time is 12 hours. 'I think it depends on the particular intelligence in the area. It has to be renewed on a proportionate basis. When the intelligence is renewed, and when the risk is no longer there,' she explained. 'Clearly when the risk is no longer, then the section 60 will no longer be there.' Ferrari quickly replied; 'But... it's not 12 hours is it? That's one of the new factors isn't it? It's 24 hours isn't it?' 'Oh forgive me, 24 hours - I need another coffee.' 'OK....and it wasn't 12 prior to that, was it minister, it was 15.' Ferrari continued with his grilling, pointing out: 'You're the minister who has been briefed for this, I'm merely the journalist asking the questions. 'So I'll put it to you again - superintendents needs to have authorise the extension. What hours are we talking about minister? You're the person who's briefed.' 'No, I'm being quite upfront with you, I haven't got the paper in front of me. Forgive me,' she said with a smile. Ferrari said: 'Do you not think you should know, minister?' 'Well, I do know, but the fact is -' 'Do share then, so sorry.' She replied: 'You're doing a very good job of demonstrating that clearly I don't have the papers in front of me now.'  'You're the minister who has been put forward to do this [...] I'm asking you about the thing you've been sent out to do and you don't know. 'Why should my listeners have confidence in this?' 'Because I am part of the government and the home secretary and the policing minister who have put these powers in place and are listening to the chief constables and what they've asked for,' she replied. Ferrari then offered the answer to the minister, explaining: 'A section 60 can be extended to 48 hours, rather than the current 39.' The minister also tried to justify why these stop and search measures even needed to be introduced to reduce knife crime. 'We want to continue to bear down on this violent crime,' she explained. Maclean said it was part of a wider response from the government, including providing 'other things for young people to do' other than engage with knife crime. She added: 'I can't imagine what it would be like to be a mother, watching my child go out of the door and thinking, 'will he or she come home tonight?''", "62d61ca2caa360fbdbe1a68669ee3d4b5cb20ffe8278bfbe8bc9dee1": "The BBC has responded to comments made by former Strictly Come Dancing contestant Rachel Riley about her experience on the show. Rachel competed on Strictly back in 2013, where she became the sixth contestant to be eliminated from the series. Speaking to the Sunday Times over the weekend, the Countdown presenter admitted she found Strictly to be 'very produced' and accused bosses of showing preferential treatment to some celebs. 'I think they know from the start who they want to win and what journeys they want to take different people on, to have the right balance, and they can obviously fix the scores,' she claimed. Rachel added: 'I think Brits want an underdog. We want to build someone up, not see someone who is good from the start - that's not the heart of these programmes.' Dismissing Rachel's suggestion, a BBC spokesperson told The Sun: 'This claim is categorically untrue. 'The BBC has strict procedures and editorial guidelines in place regarding impartiality and Strictly upholds all of these.' Throughout her time on Strictly, Rachel was paired with professional dancer Pasha Kovalev. While she was married at the time, Rachel split from her husband shortly after Strictly and later began dating Pasha, with whom she is now married and shares two children. Last week, the Maths expert voiced her frustration at her relationship being held up as an example of the so-called 'Strictly curse'. 'We've got two children. At what point can you just not call my children 'the Strictly curse'?' she said. Last year, Rachel admitted that Strictly is something she now intentionally avoids, having undergone therapy for PTSD after her time on the show. Rachel had previously claimed she'd advised famous pals against taking part, and also knows others who 'have dropped out of it due to the mental pressures involved'.", "24472008d4ac51300186a41e0f0950c79b139da8b271af08dc93fb63": "A senior Conservative has added his voice to those calling for a windfalll tax on energy giants to help people deal with the cost-of-living crisis. Mel Stride, the chairman of the Commons Treasury committee, said on Monday 'there is a case' for the move. Labour has been calling for the tax amid a steep rise in energy bills, but the government has so far rejected the demand. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said on Sunday he would be opposed to the idea as it would deter new investment. But Stride told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'Kwasi's absolutely right that, in principle, putting up taxes unannounced, effectively, retrospectively, just puts a large sign up that says, 'it's not a good place to invest', and we don't want to do that. 'At the same time, we are in extraordinary circumstances, the supernormal profits that these companies have made are vast. 'And I personally think there is a case now for looking at a one-off windfall tax and channelling that money in towards those who are really struggling and are bearing the brunt of these cost-of-living challenges.'  A windfall tax is a one-off tax on a company or group of companies. It is so named as it targets excess profits the firms had not expected to make or were responsible for.   In this case, oil and gas companies are raking in extra cash as a result of high energy prices in part due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Keir Starmer has said an extra 10 per cent should be added to their corporation tax bill for one year. Labour has said the move would raise PS1.2bn, with the money used to save people PS600 on their bills. It comes as Ofgem announced the price cap on household energy bills could be reviewed every three months. The energy regulator said that it might insert two new reviews a year, one in January and another in July. It would help pass on savings from a potential fall in gas prices to customers more rapidly, Ofgem said, and also protect under-pressure energy suppliers from being damaged by the cap.

Sam represented the UK at this year's song contest in Turin with his self-penned song Space Man, which finished in second place on the night, also landing the most points of any at this year from the Eurovision juries. With the contest now over for another year, the musician landed back in the UK on Sunday, where was given a triumphant reception. He was photographed arriving at Heathrow Airport sporting a pink bucket hat, in recognition of this year's Eurovision winners, the Ukrainian act Kalush Orchestra, whose song Stefania bagged a hefty 631 points to Sam's 466 on Saturday night.

On Sunday night, the BBC revealed that David Tennant, who portrayed the tenth incarnation of The Doctor, will be back in action in honour of Doctor Who's 60th anniversary in 2023. He'll also be joined by Catherine Tate, who played the Doctor's much-loved companion Donna Noble. Joking about the mysterious nature of David and Catherine's impending comeback, returning showrunner Russell T Davies said: 'They're back!

The prime minister said there would be 'a necessity to act' to protect the interests of consumers and businesses in the province if the EU does not budge. His comments, in an article in the Belfast Telegraph, came as he prepares to fly to Northern Ireland for crunch talks with political leaders.  The Protocol, a key part of the withdrawal treaty struck between the UK and EU after Brexit, has led to checks on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.   This has angered the Democratic Unionist Party, who have said they will not enter into a power-sharing executive at Stormont at Sinn Fein unless the Protocol is radically redrawn. The EU has insisted that it will not renegotiate the Protocol, and that any unilateral action by the UK would break international law. But in his article, the PM said 'many things had changed' since he signed up to the Protocol, including the covid pandemic and war in Ukraine, which he blamed for the cost of living crisis. He said the Protocol had prevented the government from being able to assist people in Northern Ireland in the same way as those in the rest of the UK. 'For the Chancellor of the Exchequer to say in his Spring Statement that people in Northern Ireland could not be granted the same benefits in terms of tax and VAT as those in the rest of the same country is a serious issue,' Johnson said. 'It means that our ability to assist with post-Covid recovery and - moreover, the long-term economic development of Northern Ireland - is restricted.' He added: 'We will always keep the door wide open to genuine dialogue. And we will continue to protect the single market - as it has been protected throughout the existence of the Protocol so far - and the open border with the Republic of Ireland which will always be of paramount importance. 'There is without question a sensible landing spot in which everyone's interests are protected. Our shared objective must be to the create the broadest possible cross-community support for a reformed Protocol in 2024. 'I hope the EU's position changes. If it does not, there will be a necessity to act. 'The government has a responsibility to provide assurance that the consumers, citizens and businesses of Northern Ireland are protected in the long-term.

What do hiring managers really think about how well you did? What does that radio silence after an interview mean? To demystify the hiring process, we asked a mix of career experts to reveal the biggest unspoken job interview rules they know of. Although they aren't often shared with job candidates, they're truths everyone ought to know.  Rule #1: Interviewers want a highlight reel, not an exhaustive list of everything you have done.  Job candidates are guaranteed to be asked some version of 'Tell us about yourself' and 'Why are you interested in our company/role?' said Anyelis Cordero, founder of Propel on Purpose Coaching, a career coaching service designed for first-generation professionals. You may think you can just repeat what your resume says. But that would be a mistake. 'Interviewers are going to expect [you] to be able to concisely walk them through your career. This is an area many experienced professionals struggle with, especially first-gen professionals, because the unspoken rule here is that the interview wants the highlight reel,' Cordero said. 'Since most interviews are 30 minutes, if you don't practice, you'll make the mistake of spending too much time on this answer and not leave enough time to answer other questions.' Other job interview questions come with silent subtext and expectations, too. The job search is all about demonstrating your competence, commitment, and compatibility, said Gorick Ng, a career adviser at Harvard University and the author of The Unspoken Rules: Secrets to Starting Your Career Off Right.  'The interview question 'Tell us about a time when...?' is really a competence question of 'Have you done a similar job before?' and 'Do you have a good head on your shoulders?' The interview question 'Do you have any questions for me?' is really a commitment question of 'Do you care enough about us to do enough research to ask a question that you couldn't have found the answer to on Google?' And the interview question 'Tell us about yourself' is really a competence, commitment, and compatibility question,' Ng said.  Rule #2: To be a stronger candidate, you need to understand the role of each person you interview with.  Tailoring your questions and answers based on the roles that individual interviewers hold is one of the best unwritten rules to a successful interview, said Daniel Space, a senior human resources business partner for large tech companies. 'The way I answer what a peer is going to ask me in an interview is going to be a little different than what I tell a manager,' he said. 'I know what the peer wants is: 'Can Daniel do his job? Can he hold up the team? Is he good for collaboration?' What the manager wants to know is 'Can Daniel do his job without a lot of interference from me? Can I trust him to make tough decisions? What level of support do I need to provide him?'' Sharai Johnson, a sourcer for Latinx and Black engineering talent for a large tech company, said she wants job candidates to understand the differences between a sourcer, a recruiter and a hiring manager. Johnson said a sourcer's job is to gain the interest of passive talent; sourcers may schedule the first interview, then pass off duties to a recruiter, who will be in contact with candidates through the end of the hiring process but doesn't make final hiring decisions.  'A recruiter and a sourcer can advocate on behalf of a candidate, but at the end of the day, the hiring manager is the one that actually can get the budget approval and send the 'yes' or the 'no,'' Johnson said. 'It's just important to understand those moving parts and those people, so you know who to reach out to and who to direct questions to.'  Rule #3: Your body language makes a big difference. Laura Hunting, CEO of Found By Inc., a talent agency and executive search firm specializing in design, said one unspoken job interview rule is that a candidate's body language can speak just as loudly as the words they actually say.  'Be aware of how you're sitting, what you're doing with your hands, your facial expression, your eye contact,' Hunting said. 'Your body language sends signals and impacts your success in an interview whether your interviewer is aware of its impact on their feedback or not.' Hunting recommends giving facial cues and eye contact to show you are being an active listener. It's a small step, but it can make a big difference. Rule #4: You need to be prepared with more than one career story to tell.  It's important to go into a job search process knowing how to tell the story of your career. But if you want to be an even stronger candidate, you need more than one story to tell interviewers, because often, they debrief each other.  Space said that ideally, you should have three or four success stories that you can rotate between interviewers because he has seen hiring panels in which it counted against candidates if they told the same story to every person they talked with. 'If they have that one amazing story of how they sold that really difficult client, if all five people were told that story, sometimes it helps them because it helps reinforce it,' he said. 'But in other cases, it actually helps to have different stories.'  Rule #5: Following up is not going to speed up an offer. Hearing nothing back after an interview you thought went amazingly well is frustrating to deal with. 'Am I being ghosted?' you may huff. The good news is that the silence is usually not personal, and likely due to other interviews being conducted or internal bureaucracy.  But the bad news is that those nudges and 'Just following up!' emails are not going to speed up the process. If you have followed up and held people accountable to their deadlines and you are still hearing radio silence, that's your signal to move on.  Space said when to follow up depends on your situation, but if you have reached out, understand that your nudges are not going to change interviewers' minds about their decision.  'Nobody likes hearing this,' he said. 'But I have yet to see a candidate send an email to a recruiter and all of a sudden, a recruiter being like, 'Oh, I totally forgot about you. Yes, they want to make you an offer.' They know who you are and who you are in the placement.' What actually can speed up a job offer is having another one in hand. If you are hearing silence after a job interview, you may be waitlisted. That silence may mean 'they liked you, but didn't like you enough to give you an offer immediately, so are interviewing other candidates,' Ng said.  'This is your cue to increase your market value and leverage to prove to this company, 'Hey, if I'm good enough for this other company, I must be good enough for you,'' Ng said. 'If you get another offer and are up against a deadline to accept, let this company know and see if they can accelerate your decision.' Rule #6: A thank-you note can be a networking opportunity, but it will not get you the job.  Thank-you notes can be a way to connect with someone after a job interview. If you are in a traditional job environment, they may be expected or desired, so you should double-check with your recruiter if you aren't sure whether to send one after an interview.  Just understand that it will very rarely make a pivotal difference between getting hired or not. 'If you make a decision based on that, that is poor leadership, because someone just did an extra step of administrative homework versus demonstrating their skill or value,' Space said.  'Never, ever, ever, in 20 years of sitting with leaders across eight different companies doing mass hiring, has a manager ever said, 'Well, we should go with this person because they sent a thank-you,'' he said.  Rule #7: No matter how great the interview makes you feel about a prospective employer, check with people who actually work there. Bernadette Pawlik, a career strategist with 25 years of executive recruiting experience, said one of her unspoken rules is to 'Never take a job without speaking with your peers.' Talking with colleagues who have worked with your potential new boss is going to give you a much clearer picture of what the management and company culture is like than whatever careful response you are given in a job interview.  'No one is going to say: 'Yes, I am a dreadful manager'... But if you ask your potential peers how work gets done and they don't mention the manager's support, that tells you that this potential boss may be a dreadful manager,' Pawlik said. 'It's the day-to-day reality which makes a difference between whether you go into work eagerly or whether you go into work thinking, 'Oh, God, so many more days until Friday,' she added.", "f9410007dbf0366b66732792f74eda69165a3e6b9b9e89eb3e9070c9": "Good food doesn't require a long list of ingredients. In our new series, PS5 Meals, we'll bring you recipes that keep things simple - and under a fiver. Writing your shopping list for the week ahead? It can be easy to fall into the habit of buying the same food on rotation (pizza, pasta, stir fry, repeat?).  So this week, we're sharing some mid-week meal inspiration to shake things up, with a recipe created by Dom Sherriff, the Brighton-based co-owner and head chef of vegan restaurant Bonsai. His miso glazed aubergine with seasoned rice is healthy, simple to cook, and works out at just PS1.24 per person.  Ingredients (serves 4) Aubergine x 2 PS1.38* Veg oil 50ml PS0.07 Glaze: White Miso 100g PS1.50  Maple syrup 40g PS0.64  Garlic 1 clove, finely chopped PS0.06  Water 50g  Rice: Basmati rice 420g PS0.56 Soy sauce 40ml PS0.42 Pure Sesame oil 10ml PS0.33  (optional coriander garnish)  Total cost from Tesco = PS4.96 Method:    For the glaze, finely chop one clove of garlic and place in a small saucepan, add in white miso, maple syrup, water, and mix together with a whisk until combined, heat up to a simmer and then set aside.   Cut both aubergines in half lengthways, heat up a frying pan, pour 50ml of oil into the pan. When the oil is at a medium heat, place the aubergine halves face down and cook until golden brown.   Preheat oven to 200degC. Place the aubergines onto greaseproof paper on a tray flat side facing up, cover with tin foil and roast in the oven for 20 minutes, remove from the oven, take the tin foil off and evenly cover with the miso glaze. Return to the oven for a final 5 minutes.   Place 420g rice in a medium sized saucepan and rinse with cold water. This helps to wash away the starch, repeat this process three times, then cover the rice with 600g of cold water.   Place the pan on a medium high heat with a lid, bring to a simmer and cook for 12 minutes.   After 12 minutes remove the lid and ensure all the water has been absorbed. Take off the heat and place the lid back on. Leave the rice to rest for 10 minutes with the lid on.   Finally fluff the rice with a fork and mix through the soy sauce and sesame oil.   To Serve:  Place half an aubergine on each plate. Divide the rice into four equal parts. Taking a small ramekin or coffee cup, dunk it into cold water and press the rice into the ramekin - the water will stop it sticking to the ramekin. Then, turn it upside down next to the aubergine to release the newly formed rice castle. Finely chop the coriander and sprinkle over the rice and serve. Garnish with chopped coriander or chives. *Prices correct at time of publication, based on volumes needed.

Simon Lightwood was picked to stand in Wakefield following a controversial selection process. The by-election is taking place after the previous Tory MP, Imran Ahmad Khan, resigned after he was convicted of sexually assaulting a teenage boy. HuffPost UK revealed last week that Keir Starmer's office had blocked the deputy leader of the local council, Jack Hemingway, from standing over his previous support for Jeremy Corbyn. At the final selection meeting today, the Wakefield constituency Labour party's executive - who resigned their positions on Friday - walked out after hearing from Lightwood and Kate Dearden, the other candidate shortlisted. In a statement, they said: 'Today's meeting should have had a good range of candidates to choose from, including quality Wakefield based aspirants. Instead they had just two, with all the Wakefield options already stripped out.' In a further blow to Labour's campaign, the powerful GMB union has also said it will not endorse the party's candidate. But a Labour source hit back: 'We are rightly setting a high bar for our candidates at every level. 'The Labour Party has changed and our priority is the voters, not obsession with internal machinations and niche political issues, and we know that Wakefield and Britain deserves better than this Tory government and that's what we'll set out to do in this campaign.' Speaking after his selection was confirmed, Lightwood said: 'It is an honour to be the Labour candidate for Wakefield. 'Twenty years ago I joined the Labour Party here in Wakefield, and for ten years I lived, studied and worked in this great city. We have a lot to be proud of in Wakefield, and a huge amount of strength and resilience in our communities, but the Conservatives and their disgraced MP Imran Ahmad Khan have failed us. 'I will fight tooth and nail for our hard working communities. Wakefield deserves a fresh start, and someone who is going to be their voice at Westminster, help people through the cost of living crisis, fix our broken transport system and ensure people feel safe on our streets.

Back in March, Nat was rushed to intensive care after being hit by a car in Halton, Leeds while walking home after a night out. Ellie hadn't appeared on the current series of the Channel 4 show since, with producers reportedly telling her to take as long as she needed. On Friday's episode of Gogglebox, Ellie made her first appearance on the show since the accident, and was also seen making a phonecall to Nat as they jokingly discussed weddings.  Referencing an earlier conversation they'd had, Ellie asked him what he thought a 'shotgun marriage' meant. 'You're forced to get married,' he replied, prompting much laughter from Ellie and Izzy.  When they cleared up that it actually a wedding that happens when the bride is pregnant, Ellie asked if that was what Nat had planned for them, to which he insisted: 'No!' Following the incident on March 18, Nat was reportedly initially placed on a life support machine with a family member revealing he had suffered a broken neck and back as well as two collapsed lungs. In a short statement at the time, West Yorkshire Police confirmed: 'The pedestrian remains in a critical but stable condition in hospital and enquiries into the incident are ongoing'. Prior to Friday's episode of Gogglebox airing, Ellie shared a snap of her and Izzy on Instagram thanking fans for their messages.  'Looking forward to getting back on your screens tonight!

The foreign secretary confirmed that the UK supports the Nordic country's application to join the military alliance. Finland, which has an 800 mile border with Russia, has been forced to rethink its policy on Nato membership by the war in Ukraine. Pekka Havisto, the Finnish foreign minister, said: 'By joining Nato, Finland will strengthen its own security and that of all of Europe. 'We are making this historic decision for future generations.' Sweden is also actively considering applying for Nato membership in light if Russia invasion of Ukraine. Last week, Boris Johnson signed security and co-operation agreements with both Sweden and Finland.  The prime minister said: 'This week, many of us have been paying tribute to the brave men and women who secured victory and peace in Europe 77 years ago.   'So, it's a sad irony that we've been forced to discuss how best to fortify our shared defences against the empty conceit of a 21st century tyrant.'  Nato was formed in 1949 to prevent a resurgence of nationalism and militarism in Europe after two world wars, and to deter the Soviet Union's expansion.   Its membership has swelled to 30 member nations, and over the 1990s and 2000s its enlargement stretched further east to include the former Soviet republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.     Article 5 of the Nato constitution says: 'An attack against one ally is considered as an attack against all allies.' Meanwhile, the Ministry of Defence has said Russia has lost around one-third of the ground troops since it invaded Ukraine in February.  'Russian forces are increasingly constrained by degraded enabling capabilities, continued low morale and reduced combat effectiveness., the latest MoD assessment of the war said. 'Many of these capabilities cannot be quickly replaced or reconstituted, and are likely to continue to hinder Russian operations in Ukraine.   'Under the current conditions, Russia is unlikely to dramatically accelerate its rate of advance over the next 30 days.'

Wade, Sabrina Fonfeder decided to tweet something that was partly inspired by the news and partly inspired by an ex-boyfriend.  'I tweet this every time men decide it's time to make decisions about women's bodies, but my ex boyfriend thought all women got their period on the 15th of the month,' she told her followers. 'He was 26 at the time.' In a follow-up tweet, Fonfeder, a development executive in New York for the TV and film company Irony Point and the podcast company Radio Point, explained her ex's confusion. He had once heard a comedian joke that he 'loves his girlfriend, except around the 15th of the month, if ya know what I mean.' Fonfeder's ex figured he knew what the comedian meant: All women get their period on the 15th, naturally! Fonfeder's tweet went viral, racking up more than 19,000 retweets and 196,000 likes. It also opened the floodgates for women wanting to share stories of exes who were equally flummoxed by the workings of the female body. 'My ex thought we could just start our periods whenever we wanted,' one woman said. 'He asked if I could schedule it around his birthday once. Someone married him and had his child.' 'My ex-husband - while I was pregnant with his child - believed the baby was in my literal stomach, and when I ate food, it fell on top of the baby,' another wrote. 'I once dated a 23 year-old who was furious that I mentioned drinking wine while on my period,' another woman said. 'He assumed it was dangerous because periods are related to pregnancy. I was like, sir, I am the opposite of pregnant right now.'  Then there was this doozy, from an aspiring physician no less: 'I had an ex that told me women shouldn't complain about their periods because they are clearly getting pleasure from their tampons. He was pre-med.' Reading the collected tweets is seriously funny but also seriously sad; the myriad misconceptions the men voiced about women's bodies and simple reproduction matters highlight the dire need for comprehensive sex education in America's schools - and around the world. According to the Sexuality and Information Council of the United States, only 38% of high schools and 14% of middle schools across the country teach the topics identified as critical for sex education by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That includes instruction on healthy relationships and lessons on birth control, abortion and sexually transmitted diseases. Currently, 21 states have no sex education requirements at all. The fight to improve reproductive health education in schools isn't getting any easier, either. Increasingly, critics of even basic sex ed are labe;ling teachers who provide the lessons as 'groomers' intent on 'sexualising' children in the classroom. If you're a parent worried that your kid will end up similarly misinformed, it's worth reaching out to your child's school to find out who oversees the health and sex education program, what their teaching entails and in what grades the lessons take place. If you want to cover your bases at home, Sex Ed for Social Change (SIECUS), recently put out a great list of online sex ed resources for kids of all ages. Fonfeder said the need for better sex ed is an obvious takeaway from her thread. But her intended argument was just that men shouldn't be able to legislate parts of reproduction and the human body that they don't understand.  'I mean, scroll through the responses to my tweet for 10 seconds and remember that literally anyone is allowed to run for office and make rules that govern your body,' she told HuffPost. It's frightening, Fonfeder noted, that the guy who thought his pregnant wife carried their baby inside her stomach, alongside her lunch, can run for public office and vote on legislation about women's bodies. It's not like elected officials haven't voiced similarly confounding beliefs. Think of former Congressman Todd Akin of Missouri and his infamous declaration about rape: 'If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.' Then there was Dan Flynn, a former Texas state representative who was one of the main architects of a 2013 proposed anti-abortion law in the state -- even though he had no idea how abortion actually worked. As an interview with Samantha Bee revealed, Flynn seemed to think that abortion providers cut into women's bodies. (Wrong procedure; that's a C-section.) 'Each story in the thread about someone's dumb ex is dumber than the next, but nothing in that thread is much crazier than some of the things current members of Congress have said,' Fonfeder said. 'Madison Cawthorn is someone's dumb ex. Ted Cruz is some poor, poor woman's dumb ex.' Besides providing comic relief, Fonfeder hopes her thread reminds readers that if lawmakers are intent on legislating women's bodies and reproductive health care, they should at least be able to pass a ninth-grade biology class. 'I shudder to think that someone other than the woman herself would have a say in health care decisions, especially if that someone is a guy who thinks women can swallow a camera to conduct a gynecological exam.' 'No,' Fonfeder joked, 'that's not a belief from a guy from my thread. That's an actual lawmaker from Idaho.'

When you want to increase your energy, it's easy to reach for the obvious boosters. But there are only so many protein bars, energy drinks and caffeine-charged coffees that you can take. And in excess, none are great for you. Which is where Phizz comes in. Described as the lovechild of Berocca and Lucozade, these effervescent multivitamin electrolyte tablets are designed to keep you hydrated and up your energy, but in a healthy way. We all know the key to staying alert, stimulated and vitalised is drinking water. Our bodies naturally lose it every day - especially after a workout.  The NHS Eatwell Guide suggests we should be trying to drink six to eight glasses to compensate for the amount of water we lose on the daily - which is about 1.2 to 1.5 litres. But getting those glasses in can be a challenge.  Phizz's two-in-one formula replenishes the water you need without having to drink your body weight in H20. It also contain the four main electrolytes you lose through sweating (sodium, potassium, magnesium and zinc). A recommended two tablets in 300ml of water can triple your normal water intake.  Not drinking enough water leads to dehydration. Even in its mildest form, this can give you difficulty concentrating, headaches, irritability, lethargy, and sleepiness. Sound familiar? Factor in last night's happy hour drink(s), that lunchtime spin class, 5k run or even just sitting at your desk under the office air con, and you'll be craving more. Phizz sorts out that hydration and is also formulated to boost you with 18 vitamins and antioxidants, including more vitamin C that three oranges, more potassium than a banana and as much zinc as 600g of spinach. The tablets comes in two fruity flavours - orange and apple & blackcurrant - and they're vegan-friendly as well as gluten, soy and GMO-free. Each tube contains enough tablets for 20 drinks.  More than 50 teams across the football Premier League & Championship use Phizz in training, but it's not just for pros. Instagram is full of people taking them before, during and after workouts, while others tame them on holiday to tackle jet lag and/or their hangovers (because we all need that help from time to time). You can buy Phizz on Amazon in a one-off purchase or in bulk with Save and Subscribe. It's time to get your energy back!

The couple, who have two daughters aged seven and four years old, sold their wooden kitchenware and home decor at local markets before the war began, supplementing their income with their online Etsy store. But now, as Russia's invasion continues, their business has been forced to move completely online, with Ihor trying to keep sales afloat while Alla and the children have temporarily fled to Germany.  Their workshop has thankfully survived the bombing, though it's surrounded by destroyed buildings. Operations are disrupted and sales are down, but Ihor and Alla are still donating part of their profits to the Ukrainian army and humanitarian efforts.  'My husband never held any gun or weapon in his hands, he can't fight, but he can do what he does the best: to make beautiful wooden tableware,' Alla, 36, tells HuffPost UK.  'A lot of businesses and shops didn't resume their work, a lot of our suppliers aren't at work yet. It's difficult to fill the car with gasoline. So, there are problems with logistics.' Folk craft is an integral part of traditional Ukrainian culture, so it's no surprise that Etsy is big business in the country, with more than one million product listings from sellers in Ukraine currently live on the site.  The company has made moves to support its community, including cancelling balances owed by Ukrainian sellers, including advert fees and listing fees, representing almost $4m (PS3.3m). But business is still difficult for those now relying on the site more than ever.  Another seller, Svitlana, from western Ukraine, shares how the war is impacting sellers even in areas that have not been invaded by Russian troops. Svitlana, who didn't want her surname to be published, runs a business selling traditional Ukrainian clothing out of the city of Ternopil in the west of the country. 'It is relatively calm here, if you do not take into account the frequent air raid alerts and curfews,' she says. 'The main battles are taking place in the eastern and southern regions of Ukraine.' However, neighbouring cities just 150km away are regularly bombarded with rockets. When the alarms siren, Svitlana and her team have to take refuges in basement bomb shelters, meaning the production time of goods has increased.  'The main risk, as I understand it, may be that fragments of downed missiles may fall on us,' she says. Ukrposhta - Ukraine's national mail service - is still operating in Ternopil, but delivery times have extended, also impacting the bottom line of Svitlana's business.  'The war has changed our lives, our way of life, our pace and working conditions,' she says. 'Logistics were disrupted, the supply of fabric for tailoring was disrupted. The delivery time of goods has increased, especially to European countries. 'But we are working no matter what in the name of our victory. Ukraine was, is and will be. We pray for peace in our land. 'We are grateful to all peoples and countries for their help in this difficult struggle against Russian fascism.' Faced with difficult or impossible selling conditions, many Ukrainian Etsy sellers have pivoted their businesses overnight in an attempt to generate income. This is the case for Kovtun Nadezhda, 38, who had a successful business selling doll's house furniture from her workshop in Priluki, not far from Kyiv, before the war started. Now, she's selling digital downloads of art created by her children.  'When the war started, our business came to an end. We were unable to ship physical items as all postal services were down,' she says. 'For this reason, our family was left without any income, and the price for food and goods increased several times. Leaving for Poland, we had 40 dollars [PS31].' Kovtun and her husband, Ruslan, and their four children, Diana, Rostislav, Vladislav and Daniel, fled to Poland with all they could carry, including their three cats. At the refugee centre, the couple's 11-year-old son, Vladislav, started drawing pictures 'expressing his love for home and Ukraine'. This soon turned into a way to raise much-needed funds.  Kovtun is now listing downloads of drawings by her children, available to purchase from PS8. Money raised is helping to support the family, and they're also donating part of the funds to the Ukrainian army. The family has now been housed in Poland. While her regular business is down, Kovtun continues to sell downloads of her children's artworks. 'Thanks to the support of people, we have housing, food and everything necessary for a peaceful life in Poland, as well as [the] cats are safe,' she says. 'But our thoughts and hearts are in Ukraine.' If you're someone in the UK or US who shops on Etsy regularly and wants to support Ukraine, you may be tempted to purchase one of the many pins, flags or slogan tote bags and t-shirts declaring Slava Ukraini! (Glory to Ukraine!) But Alla suggests checking where these sellers are based. Although often well-intentioned, many of these products are being created by Brits, Americans and Canadians.  'I think that now it is more important to buy products from Ukrainian sellers who stay in Ukraine and do their jobs no matter the war,' she says. 'We want to bring love and beauty to this world, not war and destruction.' Ihor has recently expanded his woodwork line to include new products featuring national Ukrainian symbols, for example, which Alla believes 'will remind people how they stand with Ukraine'.  'The Ukrainian economy fell to 50% and we can't sell our products on the local market as before. Etsy is the only one channel where we can sell our products,' she says. 'And it is one of the ways for people all over the world to support Ukrainian families and small businesses.'  Kovtun also wanted to express her gratitude for people across Europe who've chosen to support independent businesses in Ukraine.

In their latest assessment of the war, the Ministry of Defence (MoD), said Moscow's offensive in Ukraine's Donbas region has also 'fallen significantly behind schedule'. It is the latest evidence that Russia is losing a war which Putin had expected to be over within days of the invasion starting on February 24. The MoD set out its latest intelligence on the situation on the ground in a series of tweets this morning.  They said: 'Russia's Donbas offensive has lost momentum and fallen significantly behind schedule. Despite small-scale initial advances, Russia has failed to achieve substantial territorial gains over the past month whilst sustaining consistently high levels of attrition. 'Russia has now likely suffered losses of one third of the ground combat force it committed in February.' Russia has also lost 'critical enablers such as bridging equipment and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance drones', the defence officials said. The MoD added: 'Russian forces are increasingly constrained by degraded enabling capabilities, continued low morale and reduced combat effectiveness. Many of these capabilities cannot be quickly replaced or reconstituted, and are likely to continue to hinder Russian operations in Ukraine. 'Under the current conditions, Russia is unlikely to dramatically accelerate its rate of advance over the next 30 days.' At a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Berlin this morning, foreign secretary Liz Truss said it was essential to maintain support for the government in Kyiv to help it 'push Russia out'. She said in a statement: 'Putin must face a sustained defeat in Ukraine, Russia must be contained and such aggression must never happen again. 'Ukraine's security must come from it being able to defend itself. Allies must support Ukraine's move to Nato-standard equipment, immediately providing artillery, training and the required expertise.'", "36853c540a524abbb79793524fc6fb79143f5192fa303847f06ec946": "Sam Ryder has said the 'stigma' about the UK's Eurovision performance has finally been 'destroyed' after he brought home our best result in 24 years.

It was the the highest the UK has placed since 1998, when Imaani's Where Are You? finished just behind Israel's Dana International, who won with her song Diva. In the years since, Britain has suffered a number of embarrassment moments, receiving the dreaded 'nul points' in 2003 with Jemini's Cry Baby and in 2021 with James Newman's Embers.

The former leader - who has previously backed legalisation of the drug - spoke out after a row broke out over Sadiq Khan's decision to set up a commission to examine the issue. The London mayor announced during a visit to America that former cabinet minister Lord Falconer will chair a commission examining the current laws on cannabis. But that provoked an angry backlash from many shadow cabinet members, including Yvette Cooper and Wes Streeting, who believe it risks making Labour look soft on crime. 'Yvette is furious about it,' a Labour source told HuffPost UK. 'People are just rolling their eyes because it definitely is not the official party line.' Asked if he would like to see cannabis legalised, Miliband said: 'That isn't Labour's position, no. 'We welcome Sadiq looking at these issues because this debate carries on and should carry on.' He added: 'I've said in the past that this is something that needs to be looked at, I think you probably know that. 'But Labour's shadow cabinet position, which is a position I support as a member of the shadow cabinet, is that we're not yet convinced of the case for moving on decriminalisation, but obviously we'll look at what Lord Faconer's commission has to say.'  During his US trip, the London mayor visited a cannabis dispensary in California -- where the drug is legal for medical and recreational use by adults -- which he described as 'fascinating'.   Khan told the BBC: 'We need to have an honest, open conversation about the evidence in relation to the history of cannabis and our laws in the UK and our experience of the health consequences in relation to crime and the community.     'The best way to do that will be with the drugs commission we've now set up.      'You can hear from the experts, that's one thing, but seeing it for yourself ... hearing from those who cultivate and grow this plant has been fascinating.' Home secretary Priti Patel was one of a number of senior Tories who were quick to criticise Khan for his intervention, saying his time would be 'better spent focusing on knife and drug crime in London'. 'The mayor has no powers to legalise drugs,' she tweeted. 'They ruin communities, tear apart families and destroy lives.'

The former cabinet minister said 'talking about personalities is not a helpful thing to do'. Hunt, who Johnson defeated in the 2019 Tory leadership contest, also refused to give a definitive answer when asked whether the prime minister was the right person to take the party into the next general election. And while he insisted now was not the right time for another leadership race, he once again refused to rule himself out of running if once took place. Appearing on BBC One's Sunday Morning programme, Hunt was asked: 'Is Boris Johnson an honest man?' He replied: 'I think that talking about personalities is not a helpful thing to do.  'It's a simple question but it's not a helpful thing to do when I've just said that we need to recognise the international situation is very serious and we need strong leadership from the prime minister we have.' Asked if the PM is the right person to lead the Conservatives into the next election, Hunt would only say: 'I very much hope so. 'I do also hope we recognise that in order to do that, we have a big mountain to climb in terms of winning back the support of many of our core voters. 'I hope he can turn things round, because as I say, I don't think this is the moment for a leadership contest.' On his own political ambitions, Hunt said: 'I don't rule out the return from my politics myself, but I don't think now is the right moment. 'Britain has been the most robust member of the Western alliance in the face of the first major war in Europe in our lifetimes and I think the only person who would rejoice if we had a hiatus of several months in the leadership in Britain would be (Russian president) Vladimir Putin.'", "5d43ef283baf0ec9d9de2eaa164dc5b7534f3da0dce66419624f3dcc": "Anna Richardson has shared her take on heartbreak, following reports she split with partner Sue Perkins last year.  The couple were said to have gone their separate ways in July after seven years together.  In an interview with The Mirror, Anna admitted that 'no one can ever prepare you' for the agonies of breaking up with someone later in life.  'Even when it happens a handful of times in your life, you never quite get used to it,' she said.  'I suppose I don't know whether you become more resilient as you get older, but heartbreak definitely is still that mystery that needs to be solved, and how to get over it and become stronger.'

Business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the government was prepared to scrap the post-Brexit trade agreement - known as invoking Article 16 - in order to ensure 'political stability' in Northern Ireland. The Protocol, a key part of the withdrawal treaty struck between the UK and European Union after Brexit, has led to checks on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. This has angered the Democratic Unionist Party, who have said they will not enter into a power-sharing executive at Stormont at Sinn Fein unless the Protocol is radically redrawn. Boris Johnson will fly to Belfast on Monday in an attempt to broker an agreement between the political parties to get the Northern Ireland Assembly back up and running. Appearing on Sky News this morning, Kwarteng made it clear the government was prepared to ramp up tensions with Brussels by scrapping the Protocol.  Asked if ministers were prepared to do so unilaterally, Kwarteng said: 'Absolutely right. Throughout this whole debate, even before the Protocol and the [withdrawal] treaty, we've had a number of people in this country whose presumption has been that the British government is always wrong and the EU is always right and that's clearly too simplistic. 'We've tried to enter in good faith, we've tried to negotiate the withdrawal treaty, but we've always said, even Article 16 of the Protocol itself says, that it can be abrogated unilaterally if it's shown not to be working, and clearly, if political stability is our priority and people are saying they won't go into power-sharing if it doesn't change, we have to consider very carefully how we can change it. Pressed on whether that would break international law, the business ewcretary said: 'I'm unclear as to this because clearly Article 16 is part of the Protocol itself, and when you read it, it says quite clearly there's a scope to change it unilaterally - unilaterally means that we can do that ourselves without having to reach agreement with the EU.' Kwarteng also rejected suggestions that unilateral UK action could lead to a damaging trade war, with the EU introducing tariffs which would further increase prices in the shops. 'Any tariff situation would have to go to arbitrators,' he said. 'It is not something they can do willy nilly, arbitrarily. We got into a lot of problems because we simply ruled out the ability to walk away. 'Article 16 is enshrined (in the Withdrawal Agreement). It does allow people to act unilaterally and we have got ultimately to be prepared to invoke it. 'I don't think they are necessarily going to be able to slap on tariffs arbitrarily. I think it will take a very long time for that process to work out. As far as I am concerned, we have absolutely the right to invoke Article 16 and reopen or re-examine the protocol.' Appearing on the same programme, Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney accused the UK of 'sabre rattling and grandstanding', and said there was still a chance that a negotiated settlement can be reached. He said: 'At a time when the world needs the western world to be united, to be in concert solving problems together, this is a problem we need to solve together. The last thing Ireland wants, the last thing the EU needs, is tension with a country the size and influence of the United Kingdom.'", "d076600a683746ed51a8b50c49767c60522b7e208011f66dbd4a4315": "Northern Ireland is facing a fresh political crisis as the Stormont Assembly failed to elect a new speaker amid the fall-out from the post-Brexit trading arrangement. The DUP has blocked the election of a speaker in protest at the Northern Ireland Protocol, the agreement trashed put between the UK government and Brussels to prevent a hard border with the republic of Ireland. The stalemate - the Assembly unable to function - follows Sinn Fein topping last week's Stormont elections and fears of an impasse. The DUP's leader, Jeffrey Donaldson, said he is sending a 'clear message' to the EU and the UK government about resolving issues the Protocol. Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O'Neill said accused the unionist party of 'punishing the electorate' while Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said it had been a 'shameful day' for the DUP. The DUP is also refusing to nominate for the position of deputy first minister, which will prevent the forming of a new executive, as part of its protest against the protocol. Unionists oppose the post-Brexit treaty because of the economic barriers it creates between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, and fears over the re-unification of Ireland, which is Sinn Fein's over-arching aim. It comes amid increased tensions between the Westminster government and the EU over the working of the protocol, which forms part of the UK's Withdrawal Agreement with the EU.

We talked to chefs who regularly use canned tuna, salmon and other fishes as entrees and as ingredients in other dishes. 'I'm a big fan of conservas, which are preserved foods, such as pickles, jam or canned foods, which are 'put up' in jars or tins so the product lasts longer,' TV personality and chef Andrew Zimmern tells HuffPost, adding that they're often less expensive by weight than other comparable proteins. 'As meat and poultry prices continue to climb, home cooks can find tins of beautiful salmon, tuna - and mackerel, sardines, clams and mussels - in their local markets and save real dollars by incorporating them into their regular meal planning.' It's heartening to note that not only is canned fish often inexpensive, but it's nutritious. 'Canned fish contains omega-3s, with benefits include fighting inflammation, skin nourishing, gut healing, helping you feel full longer and more,' said Jen Smiley, founder of Wake Up & Read the Labels. And then there's the convenience factor. 'The best thing about canned fish to me is that I can always have it on hand to make into a quick dinner,' said Christine Pittman, founder of CookTheStory. 'If I forget to take the chicken out of the freezer, or if I run out of time and can't get to the grocery store, having some canned fish on hand always saves the day.' It's an affordable option that's probably already in your pantry Chef Rossi, owner and executive chef of New York caterer The Raging Skillet, credits canned tuna with helping her keep body and soul together during a cash-strapped time. 'When I left home to be a starving artist, I swiped an entire pantry shelf of tuna, which my mother had gotten with coupons,' she said. 'I took her Ragu tomato sauce and dried pasta, too. I survived on a concoction of tomato sauce, canned tuna and olives I swiped from the bar next door.' 'Decades later, when I became a chef, I needed to create pasta special one day, so I mixed tuna we hadn't sold for the lunchtime tuna melt special, marinara sauce, capers and olives to make 'Starving Artist Pasta Puttanesca.' It sold out.' Think canned fish is too fishy? Try these fixes 'If you're using a good-quality brand of canned fish, it shouldn't be too fishy,' said Curtis Stone, chef and owner of Maude and Gwen Butcher Shop and Restaurant in Los Angeles. 'I suggest relying on the acidity of lemon juice and zest and the brininess of capers to address any 'fishiness' issues.' One tip is to pair canned fish with boldly flavoured ingredients, chef and cookbook author Robin Asbell said. 'There's a reason they put mayonnaise in tuna salad, since it's got an assertive presence and lots of tang,' Abell said. 'Adding in spices, chilies, crunchy vegetables, cornichons and olives all work to play down the fishy qualities.' 'Really, the hidden secret is in the sauce, so I suggest you think about mustard,' Smiley said. 'Pour some on top and it's all you're tasting.'  What's best: packed in oil or water?  The great debate among tuna lovers still rages on - oil-packed or water-packed?  Rossi insists on white albacore tuna in water. 'I think 'light' tuna tastes fishy, and to this day I can tell when my tuna salad was made with light, not white,' she said. 'Even the smallest amount of fishiness and I'm out the door.'  Another member of the packed-in-water fan club is Robin Selden, executive chef and managing partner of Marcia Selden Catering. 'I love Bumble Bee white albacore tuna in water. It's not fishy, it never has that canned fish taste - and it's what I grew up with,' she said. On the other side of the debate is Davis, who loves Chicken of the Sea in oil. 'It's moister that way,' he said.  For Asbell, it depends on the dish. 'If you're using it in a pasta and want lots of fishy umami, buy it in olive oil and use that oil in the recipe,' she said. 'If you're emphasising other flavours, buy water-packed, drain it well, and marinate it a bit before adding it to the dish.' 6 standout tuna dishes Pan bagnat: 'I love a good Nicoise salad, and this sandwich is all those great salad flavours packed into crusty and chewy bread,' Stone said. 'It's the perfect make-ahead sandwich to take to the beach or a picnic. The flavours marinate with a bit of time, but it's just as delicious to eat straightaway.' Here's Curtis Stone's recipe. Tomato and tuna pasta: 'I toss fresh heirloom tomatoes and oil-canned tuna into hot, drained pasta,' Selden said. 'The pasta soaks up the olive oil, and the tomatoes almost blanch from the heat of the pasta. Hit it with some red pepper flakes, freshly grated Parmesan and freshly torn basil, and you'll feel like you're in Italy.' Tonnato sauce: This classic Italian sauce is made with anchovies and tuna. 'It's one of the very best summer dishes,' Sandy Davis, chef for New York-based Roxo Events, said. 'I make the classic sauce for cold poached meat and a looser version to dress salads,' Zimmern said. While it came to fame as part of the dish viella tonnato, which is made with veal, you can swap out the meat in place of pasta, rice or beans, and you'll still have a delicious meal at a lower cost. Tuna croquettes: 'One very nostalgic dish for me is my mom's tuna croquette recipe, which involves mixing tuna, eggs and breadcrumbs, forming it into small patties, then sauteing,' Selden said. 'It's a very simple and delicious way to get kids to eat fish. It worked for my mom, and to this day we all love them.' Tuna noodle casserole: 'There isn't a Baby Boomer around who isn't familiar with good old tuna noodle casserole with crushed potato chips on top,' Davis said. 'It's fast, cheap and tasty. One can - or maybe two if you've got extra coins - will feed many folks.' Tuna salad: 'There are those times when comfort is needed, and you just have to break down and make the tuna salad of your grandmother,' Davis said. For me, that means using Miracle Whip, boiled eggs and sweet relish.' Selden has a different take: 'My go-to tuna salad uses Hellman's mayonnaise -- just enough to bind it together -- freshly squeezed lemon juice, diced celery, sweet onion, green apple and lots of freshly chopped dill. The addition of tart, crunchy apples and savoury dill really do the trick. Slap that between two pieces of yummy bread and add some potato chips to your sandwich for even more crunch.' 6 superstar salmon dishes Appetisers: 'This simple canned salmon dip is always a crowd favourite,' Pittman said. 'Another party treat is my lox dip recipe. I add canned salmon along with the lox (smoked salmon), so there's a lot of salmon flavour, but at a lower cost.' Creamy pasta sauce: 'Warm up sour cream or creme fraiche with dill or parsley, garlic, salt and pepper,' Pittman said. 'Then add canned fish until just heated through before tossing with cooked pasta.' Salmon loaf: 'If you want to dress up canned salmon, there's a Great Depression favourite that my paternal grandmother used to make -- salmon loaf with mustard cream sauce,' Davis said. 'Use canned salmon, crushed saltines, eggs and mayo.' Salade Nicoise with salmon tonnato sauce: 'Trust me on this: Make a traditional Provencale salade Nicoise with salmon instead of tuna,' Zimmern said. 'Dress the egg, tinned fish, potatoes, greens, tomatoes and olives with a tonnato sauce made with salmon instead of tuna. You'll have your mind blown.' Salmon burgers 'Mix together a can of salmon, two eggs, breadcrumbs, dill and lemon juice,' Pittman said. 'You just need to heat the patties through and then pop them into buns, along with your favourite burger toppings.'

In September 2021 I gave birth to my son six weeks prematurely, and for almost a month, my husband Jamie and I spent every day in the hospital, willing him to be able to come home with us. But, bringing him home wasn't quite the newborn baby bubble I imagined it to be. Survivor's guilt  The day we brought Seb home after 24 days of neonatal care should have been one of the happiest of our lives, but instead I remember feeling an overwhelming sense of guilt. On paper, we had been among the 'lucky' ones - steroid injections had meant Seb's lungs developed fully and he was born able to breathe unassisted. Nor was he struggling to gain weight, a major reason premature babies are often kept in neonatal care.  Don't get me wrong, our journey was far from easy, but when we were finally told we were being discharged, I felt guilty we were going home when there were other babies who still had weeks ahead of them in hospital.  Throughout Seb's stay, I'd also felt guilty about leaving him in the hospital every day and returning home to what felt like my 'old' life. While most new parents experience sleepless nights with a newborn, I was still getting a full night's kip, eating with both hands and watching Netflix without interruption. I'd become a mum, but I felt like a fraud, because I didn't have a baby at home to show for it.  Dianne and Min Wei from Tunbridge Wells in Kent spent 39 days in NICU when their daughter Maiya was born at 32 weeks, and Dianne also struggled with being at home without her baby. 'Coming home without Maiya was very strange,' she says. 'Our lives were on hold because we only felt like we were parents to her when we were with her in the hospital. When we came home we felt guilty and almost like we were 'cheating' for getting a full night's sleep. However, those first few weeks did give us time to recuperate and get everything ready before Maiya came home.' Post-NICU anxiety Then, in those first few weeks with Seb at home (and this is probably going to sound strange), I missed the hospital. We'd got so used to having someone caring for our baby 24/7, and suddenly that was gone. The reliance on the NICU monitors and alarms was also a hard habit to shake - in hospital, at the slightest dip in heart rate or oxygen, an alarm would sound and a nurse would be right there. Now, we had none of that comfort, and I became very anxious. Dianne experienced similar. 'We felt a big relief that we could finally be all together in the comfort of our own home, but also anxious as Maiya was now in our care and we no longer had the support we had in NICU,' she says. 'While we were glad we didn't have to visit the hospital any more, we were anxious about Maiya's weight gain as this was a big challenge for her.' For Libby Monks, 36, from Salisbury, bringing her baby Rosalie home from NICU after nine days was a hugely emotional, yet anxiety-inducing time, because her nephew Teddy had passed away in a neonatal unit at just three days old. 'Because of what happened to Teddy, I was terrified of NICU or anything being wrong with my baby,' she says. 'We had a false start when we were due to be discharged, and we were told we'd have to stay another night. I remember sobbing and saying, 'I just want to go home, we have to make it home with her.' My original birth plan included my mum coming down to support us after the birth and for her to stay up all night making sure Rosalie didn't stop breathing like Teddy did, so there was a lot of trauma there.' Missed moments Once we got home with Seb, it dawned on me how many moments we'd missed during those early weeks, and I'd feel jealous when other friends brought their newborns home almost immediately and shared photos of them. Because of the premature birth, I'd missed out on having a baby shower, didn't even really get to the 'nesting' stage of pregnancy (we were mid house renovations when he arrived), and we didn't do things like change his first nappy, which I felt oddly sad about. Libby also felt like she'd missed out on milestones due to Rosalie's hospital stay, so when they were discharged, she wanted to make sure nobody else she'd met there felt the same. 'So many of Rosalie's firsts were in NICU and whilst I was there, I couldn't take a cute photo and post it on Facebook. I ended up buying around 25 sets of milestone cards as a thank you to the NICU unit and so that other parents didn't have to miss out in the future.' The NICU experience is an intense one that many parents it find easier to talk about with others who've been through the same thing. I found some friends and family didn't really 'get' how traumatic the experience had been. Other NICU parents just understood.  That said, sometimes talking about milestones with other neonatal parents could become competitive, especially with premature babies who have an 'actual' age and a 'corrected' one, based on their original due date. Despite reminding myself that all babies, premature or not, develop at different rates, I found myself comparing Seb to the other NICU babies, worrying whether he was on track, and then experiencing that survivor's guilt again when he gained weight quicker, or slept better than others. Silver linings While I wouldn't wish the neonatal experience on any parent, I did take a lot of positives from our time in their care. Of course it was horrible coming back without a baby night after night, but by the time Seb was home, my body had started to recover from labour and things like carrying him were a lot easier than they might have been had we brought him home the day after he was born.  We were also shown how to change his nappies, bathe him and dress him in the hospital - all things we would have had to navigate on our own if circumstances had been different. For Libby, her first positive experience of NICU meant that she was mentally prepared when three years later she gave birth to twin boys at 32 weeks, and they spent four weeks in neonatal care. 'A lot of the worry was taken away from a second NICU stay because we had been there before and knew the care was exceptional,' she says. 'With my boys I had the insight to use NICU almost as a transition zone. I got to bond with and feed them, but didn't have the responsibility of being their primary carers as the fantastic NICU staff did that.' On Instagram, Nick Jonas referred to their family's journey as a 'rollercoaster' and he's not wrong - but whenever that NICU baby finally comes home, the ride really begins... as does the sleep deprivation and the overflowing washing pile.", "d7eae22dcac68a5d87308a5ec65da4a57fb900b9f10c8ce494c8f9d5": "The image I see of myself in my mind is that of a photograph taken in 1992, when I was 22 years old. The photo is of me and my friend, Sean. I'd gone with him to have his professional headshots taken (he's an actor and songwriter) and the photographer offered to snap a few of the two of us. The frame is a close-up shot of both of our faces. I am sitting on his lap, my arm around his neck, my eyes fixed on something past the camera. Sean stares directly into the lens with all the confidence and defiance of youth. We are both so very, very young. While I know, as a relatively intelligent, mostly adjusted, grown woman, that I no longer look like the person in that photo, what I see in the mirror these days always takes me a bit by surprise. It is my mother's face that stares back at me, a face that sparks both distress and grief. When and how did I start to look so old? 'There's a certain amount of sadness, grief when we look at our faces [as we get older] - I should mention I'm 73,' Naomi Woodspring, an author and gerontologist, tells me. 'Yet notions, ideas about what we see in the mirror are seen through the lens of our current age.' And these ideas change as we change. Intellectually, I know I cannot magically remove all the effects of ageing from my skin and body, no matter what advertisers and (often) the media want me to believe. I also know there must be some way to let go of my inner psychological equation that youth equals beauty and that, without it, I am no longer attractive. I'm not sure, though, how to go about changing my outdated definitions of these things. I talked with three psychologists and researchers about ways to alter the narrative running through my head, the one that prattles on about how I look old and how unattractive the wrinkles and sags in my face are. How psychologists approach ageing 'First, you have to make a decision to accept yourself and accept ageing. Think about what prevents you from doing that. You may think, 'I'm not attractive, I'm invisible.' But what, really, does this keep you from doing?' asked Ann Kearney-Cooke, an author, lecturer and director at the Cincinnati Psychotherapy Institute. 'How do you really want to spend your time?' she asked me. I don't especially want to think about how I look. It was never something that really bothered me or occupied my time, at least not until a couple of years ago when I turned 50. Now I'm often overly focused on the grey hairs and the lines and creases on my face. I want to change this narrative in my head. Cognitive behavioral therapy and thought restructuring Goali Saedi Bocci, a licensed clinical psychologist and adjunct faculty at Pacific University School of Graduate Psychology, explained to me the process of cognitive behavioral therapy and restructuring thoughts. Essentially, she explained how I could start to alter the story in my head, the one that continually laments my apparent untimely demise. Cognitive behavioural therapy is a lot about changing our thoughts, Saedi Bocci told me - which isn't an easy thing to do, at least not for me. I have a very loud and insistent voice in my head that, at times, spews all sorts of negative things. I suspect many of us do. It's difficult to change that perspective. That, though, is exactly what I needed to do. 'Cognitive restructuring, cognitive reframing, and thought distortions are challenging,' Saedi Bocci said. One kind of thought distortion is catastrophising, she explained. An example would be taking notice of a line or a wrinkle and catastrophising by thinking something like, 'My ageing is premature. By the time I'm a specific age, I'm going to look a specific way.' The subtext, of course, being that that specific way will be old and no longer attractive. 'One thing doesn't have to lead to this rabbit hole of thoughts,' continued Saedi Bocci. 'I can make an observation, take a step back and say, 'OK, I'm assessing, yes, this is a true physical change. I'm not going to say this wrinkle isn't here, but I can change the meaning of it.'' This goes hand in hand with practicing mindfulness and non judgement, Saedi Bocci explained. 'We're so obsessed with good, bad, pretty, ugly. If we take back the label, remove ourselves and not make a judgment; well, that's the healthiest place we can be.' As soon as we label something as good or bad, delicious or disgusting, or whatever, it becomes that. Words are incredibly powerful. As Kearny-Cooke put it, 'If you move around the world thinking you're pitiful, then people will see you that way.' 'And so,' said Saedi Bocci, 'being aware and intentional with our words, with our thoughts is powerful. Look at the story behind it. What does beauty mean? What does attractiveness mean?' By thinking about these things, about the backstory of them, I realised that I was capable of changing some of my preconceived notions, or cognitively restructuring my thoughts. As Saedi Bocci explained, cognitive restructuring means taking a pre-formed thought - one based on societal norms, values, expectations or things your parents may have taught you - 'into a court of law and arguing all sides of it. Is this something that's true? Is it untrue? Is it helpful? Is it unhelpful?' These kinds of questions are important when there is a level of cognitive rigidity, such as believing that only one thing - youth - equals beauty. To combat this rigidity, talk and think about other forms of beauty. 'Ask yourself, what is leading to this? Where have you gotten those messages from?' she continued. She told me I needed to find a way in, the one place where I could begin the unraveling of whatever narrative has been looping through my mind in an unhealthy way. (I confess, at times, there are several.) Shifting the narrative One way to begin shifting your narrative is to figure out what your signature strengths are, Kearny-Cooke told me. This could be a great smile or great legs. Think about how you enjoy them and/or show them, she suggested. 'Also, challenge yourself to stop seeing yourself through men's eyes,' she added. That, as Kearny-Cooke said, is often a difficult thing. But what if I redefined that? She suggested I keep track each day of any thing I did that made me feel good about my body and/or myself - things like taking a walk or learning something new or planning a trip I wanted to take. She also suggested I alter my inner monologue to include phrases like: 'I'm eating healthy, I'm moving. I have good relationships with people. I have goals. I'm proud of what I've done in my life.' 'We all are proud of some of the things we did and not so proud of others,' Kearny-Cooke said, 'but if we really try to tell ourselves a story, a new narrative about our life story, we can decide what the next chapters will look like.' One way to help do this is that, instead of getting together with friends and lamenting our culture and how older women do not seem to be as valued as younger ones, spend that time with your friends going on a hike, planning adventures (I'm partial to ones of the cycling variety) or learning a new language.  'Remember, curiosity, courage and adventure-seeking are all youthful qualities,' she added. As I pondered this, I thought about another photograph of myself, taken a couple of years ago during a monthlong cycling trip across Central Asia. In this photo, I am laughing. I haven't showered or seen a mirror in days. And I do not think I look old. All three of the experts I spoke with emphasised the importance of creating my own narrative about my life. Kearny-Cooke described it as 'honouring all the things you've overcome, the things you may still be struggling with, and the knowledge you've gained through your whole life - really honouring them,' she said. 'And then, make a decision about what you want this time to look like. Ask yourself how you can gain power.' Who do you want to be? As most of us know, we can't control a culture's or other people's reactions to us. We can, though, decide to be somebody that people want to spend time with and get to know. We need to decide who we want to be. 'Am I going to speak out about issues or values I have? Am I free from that evolutionary selection of the young woman? Thank God I'm out of that. I'm free of that. I can create my own version of a middle-aged woman,' said Kearny-Cooke. Her suggestion on how to begin to accomplish this: Make deliberate choices and write them down every day until eventually they become a mindset. 'Regardless of how you live your life, you bring that many years of experience into that face in the mirror,' Woodspring told me. 'In my research, most people readily admitted that there was a certain amount of grief connected with ageing.' 'But there was also acceptance,' she continued, 'And I believe that the acceptance comes from all of those years of life experience and is part of what happens when people realise they have lived more life than they have left to live. We begin to see the world differently. We begin to see ourselves differently.' Essentially, what I think she wanted me to know was that I am at the beginning of this transition into what I guess could be called 'old age,' that, eventually, I would make what she called a pivot, a pivot where I would begin to see myself differently. A trick to help you pivot your mindset Kearny-Cooke has a rowboat metaphor that she uses when she counsels people about beauty, ageing and acceptance. Imagine you're in a rowboat and the rudder that steers the boat is stuck. There's also water in the bottom of the boat. You have a bucket with holes in it, but still you keep trying to bail out the water. You spend all your time and energy on the water problem that you can never solve, while completely ignoring the fact that the rudder on the boat is stuck, and is really what you should be paying attention to. What I take from this is that I need to stop bailing out the water. There is nothing I can do about ageing, but what I can do is focus on regaining control of my narrative and accepting that I cannot stop the effects of ageing. Though Sean and I are not as close as we once were, we still check in occasionally. In the early '90s, we'd go out dancing two or three times a week. About 10 years ago, I sent him an email rambling about those nights we spent in questionable bars and sketchy music halls and lamenting the absence of adequate dance time in my current life. He wrote back, simply, 'I am always, always dancing with you.' And I think that, for me, that is part of how I begin to accept ageing. It's not that I want to be 'young' again or go back and relive any of it (God forbid), but I find comfort in believing that there is a 22-year-old me always and forever dancing with a 23-year-old Sean. Her existence helps me to recognise (and honour) all that has transpired over the past 30 years, as well as this new version of myself -- who may have wrinkles, grey hair and the face of her mother, but is still alive, learning and growing and becoming, and maybe, maybe also a version of 'beautiful.' And as I write these words, perhaps I am taking the first step to making them so, of deciding what the rest of the story of my life will be.

Tom died in March the age of 33 after being diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour in 2020. In an extract of his forthcoming autobiography published in The Sun, Tom told of how Ed had offered to do 'anything he could' to help him after his diagnosis, calling him a 'very special man'.  Writing prior to his death, Tom said: 'Pretty much from the moment I was diagnosed, Ed Sheeran reached out to me with an offer to do anything he could to help. 'Ed and I have known each other since he joined The Wanted on our tour bus during a promotion trip in America more than ten years ago. 'We've always run into each other over the years and had a great relationship.' He continued: 'I've never publicly said this before (and he'll probably be mad that I'm doing it now) but Ed is a very special man -- he even helped out with my medical bills when I was seeking other treatment options and having private immunotherapy. 'He didn't need to do any of that, but my wife Kelsey and I are so grateful to him for his support. It meant the world.' Together with Max George, Siva Kaneswaran, Jay McGuiness and Nathan Sykes, Tom had numerous top 10 singles in the early 2010s as The Wanted, including Chasing The Sun, Walks Like Rihanna, Lightning and the number ones All Time Low and Glad You Came. Following Tom's death, which was announced on Instagram by his wife Kelsey, the band put out a statement saying they were 'devastated by the tragic and premature loss' of their 'brother'. The group reunited for a special series of gigs earlier this year, with Tom describing being back on stage as being 'in his happy place'. In a later tribute, bandmate Max said: 'I'm heartbroken beyond words right now and I cannot even begin to imagine what the future holds without you, but whatever I do going forward, even on my darkest days, I can always smile and say, 'I shared the stage with Tom Parker'.'", "63687ce0e9d1f8fc5e40464794218e3257e3ca66932bcbb71db522e7": "The Duke of Cambridge has presented podcast host Deborah James with a damehood at her family home. The 40-year-old, known online as Bowel Babe, was honoured for her 'tireless campaigning' to raise awareness of bowel cancer. Dame Deborah posted pictures of William with herself and her family on Instagram and said it was 'such a special day'. She wrote: 'Prince William actually came to our family house today!!   'I am utterly honoured that he joined us for afternoon tea and champagne, where he not only spent a generous amount of time talking to my whole family but also honoured me with my Damehood. 'It's quite surreal having a royal pop in at home, and yes you can imagine the cleaning antics and preparation went off the scale - but it was all irrelevant because William was so kind and he put us all at ease. 'He is clearly passionate about improving oncology outcomes as the President of the Royal Marsden. 'It was such a special day for my whole family, making memories to last a life time. He's welcome back any time!' Dame Deborah has raised more than PS5.2 million for Cancer Research UK through her Bowelbabe fund on Just Giving. Having set her original target at PS250,000, she has now raised more than 20 times her goal. Dame Deborah reached the PS5 million milestone on Friday after donations from more than 240,000 supporters, including William and his wife Kate. Her Just Giving page said it is 'raising money to fund clinical trials and research into personalised medicine for cancer patients and supporting campaigns to raise awareness of bowel cancer'. She said she was 'completely lost for words' after reaching the phenomenal amount. TV presenter Lorraine Kelly responded to the news, saying: 'This is just wonderful - tears and laughter - love you @bowelbabe.'   The presenter of popular BBC podcast You, Me And The Big C disclosed on Monday that she had moved to hospice-at-home care to treat her terminal bowel cancer. She wrote on Instagram: 'Nobody knows how long I've got left but I'm not able to walk, I'm sleeping most of the days, and most things I took for granted are pipe dreams. 'I know we have left no stone unturned. But even with all the innovative cancer drugs in the world or some magic new breakthrough, my body just can't continue any more.' Dame Deborah, a former headteacher, was diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2016 and has kept her more than 500,000 Instagram followers up to date with her treatments. On Thursday night, Number 10 confirmed that James was to be made a dame, saying: 'The Queen has been pleased to approve that the honour of damehood be conferred upon Deborah James.' Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: 'If ever an honour was richly deserved, this is it. 'Deborah has been an inspiration and her honesty, warmth and courage has been a source of strength to so many people. 'Through her tireless campaigning and by so openly sharing her experience she has not only helped in our fight against this terrible disease, she has ensured countless others with the Big C have not felt alone. 'I hope this recognition from Her Majesty - backed I'm sure by the whole country - will provide some comfort to Deborah and her family at this difficult time. 'My thoughts are with them and Deborah should know she has the country's love and gratitude.' Damehoods are usually handed out by members of the royal family, including William, at investiture ceremonies which take place at royal palaces including Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle. In a personal tweet written by William and Kate this week, they said: 'Every now and then, someone captures the heart of the nation with their zest for life & tenacious desire to give back to society. '@bowelbabe is one of those special people. Her tireless efforts to raise awareness of bowel cancer & end the stigma of treatment are inspiring. 'We are so sad to hear her recent update but pleased to support the @bowelbabef, which will benefit the @royalmarsdenNHS among others.

Earlier this week, Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle company posted a photo of its new disposable diaper, 'The Diaper,' which cost $120 (PS97) for a pack of 12. Goop described the diaper on Instagram as lined 'with virgin alpaca wool and fastened with amber gemstones, known for their ancient emotional-cleansing properties.' Goop has a long history of slinging questionable and ridiculous lifestyle products -- including (but not limited to) its notorious jade 'vagina' egg and a candle called This Smells Like My Vagina. Yet the luxury disposable diaper seemed like a step too far, even for Paltrow. The timing of its launch also felt off, due to the current baby formula shortage. So, naturally, people got pissed ... but it seems that was precisely the point. Paltrow posted a video Thursday revealing that she's well aware of Goop's notoriety and had used it against everyone for a pretty solid troll. 'Goop launched a luxury disposable diaper at $120 for a pack of 12 and there was a lot of outrage. Good,' Paltrow said in the video. 'If treating diapers like a luxury makes you mad, so should taxing them like a luxury.'  She then confirmed that The Diaper was fake, and meant to anger people to draw their attention to another issue. The video's caption urged people to donate to the organisation Baby2Baby 'to help provide diapers, formula, and other essentials to families in need.'  'Despite the absolute necessity of diapers, in 33 states, they aren't treated as an essential item,' the caption read. 'They're taxed as a luxury good. (We priced our fictional Diapers at $120, because that is what the diaper tax could cost families annually).' The caption added: 'Right now, many families in need are also struggling as a result of the nationwide formula shortage.'

It comes after Boris Johnson was criticised for unveiling 38 new bills in the Queen's Speech, with none of them designed to immediately alleviate the financial pain being suffered right now by millions across the UK. The prime minister insisted the government's plans would grow the economy and create thousands of new jobs, thereby bringing down living costs in the longer term. But charities and think tanks contacted by HuffPost UK said ministers needed to take steps straight away as the public deal with soaring energy bills, rising inflation, higher council tax and increasing interest rates. They warn that unless they do, minis risk turning a crisis into 'a national emergency'. What has the government announced so far? In Ferbruary, Rishi Sunak unveiled a PS9bn package of measures to help bring down energy and council tax bills. Under the plan, energy bills will be reduced by PS200, with the money being repaid in charges over the next four years. In addition, households in bands A-D are seeing PS150 knocked off their council tax bills. This is in addition to other measures including a 5p reduction in fuel duty, reducing the Universal Credit taper rate to allow people to keep more of the money they earn, increasing the national minimum wage, PS25 extra a week in cold weather payments and raising the national insurance thresholds. According to the Treasury, the total cost of the support already announced is PS22bn. Why was the Queen's Speech such a let-down? The Queen's Speech setting out the government's legislative plans for the next 12 months - delivered by Prince Charles after Her Majesty withdrew over health concerns - contained a total of 38 bills. However, Boris Johnson was at pains to stress that there was no new money to help people feeling the pinch. The prime minister said: 'We must remember that for every pound of taxpayer's money we spend on reducing bills now, it is a pound we are not investing in bringing down bills and prices over the longer term.  'And that if anything, this moment makes clear our best remedy lies in urgentlydelivering on our mission to turbo charge the economy, create jobs and spreadopportunity across the country.'   Does Boris Johnson get it? As an unapologetic populist, the prime minister's instinct will be to make a major announcement on an extra package of financial measures to help struggling voters. But as a fiscal conservative, the chancellor will be resisting any such moves at this time. This probably explains the bizarre mix-up between Number 10 and the Treasury on the same day the Queen's Speech was announced. Johnson told the House of Commons that he and Sunak would say more on the cost of living 'in the days to come', immediately increasing speculation of an emergency budget.  But sources close to Sunak quickly made clear that they knew nothing about it, and insisted no new measures were due before the autumn. One ally of the Chancellor told HuffPost UK there were 'no announcements as far as we are aware'. They added: 'Rishi has always been clear that we would set out plans for support on energy bills for autumn when we know what the [energy] price cap is going to be - but we're not there yet.' Does the government have any plan at all? Johnson chaired a special cabinet meeting at an away day in Stoke with his top team on Thursday, where the government's response to the cost of living crisis was top of the agenda. Although no new announcements were made afterwards, it is understood that the PM and chancellor are eyeing a potential tax cut before MPs depart for the summer recess. Talk of a windfall tax on energy firms' profits - as demanded by Labour - is also increasing, despite both Johnson and Sunak repeatedly voicing their scepticism about such a move, arguing that it could hamper investment. We also know that the chancellor will unveil a further package of financial support in the autumn, when the energy price cap is expected to rise significantly once again. But critics say those on those on the lowest incomes, many of whom are regularly forced to choose between heating their homes and feeding their children, cannot wait several months for the government to step in.  What should the government be doing right now? HuffPost UK contacted a range of charities to get their take on the crisis and ask what they believe Johnson and co should do without delay to alleviate the suffering of so many people across the country. The universal view was that the government should be using the benefits system to urgently target support at those who need it most. Katie Schmuecker, principal policy adviser at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: 'The widening gap between the incomes of the poorest and what they need to afford the essentials is not just something that happens naturally - it is a political choice. 'The chancellor could have used the Spring Statement to ensure that benefits were uprated in line with this year's very high inflation, and it is not too late to act to protect people from the worst of this crisis. It just needs a political will and speedy action.' Tom Marsland, policy manager at disability equality charity Scope, said disabled people were already dealing with the increased cost of electric wheelchairs, ventilators or adapted vehicles, before factoring in soaring energy bills.  'The Queen's Speech was an opportunity to help disabled people, but this didn't happen,' he said.  'The government must urgently provide increased financial support to disabled people direct through the welfare system.  'Disabled people have seen a real terms cut to their cut to benefits as they rise less than inflation. The government has said it will uprate disability benefits again next April, but what are disabled people supposed to do for the next 12 months if they can't afford basic essentials like food and heating? We need to see benefits rise in line with inflation now.' Polly Neate chief executive of Shelter, said: 'Housing is at the root of the cost-of-living crisis. Private rents are higher than ever, bills are skyrocketing, and housing benefit is lagging dangerously behind. We've heard from renters whose landlords have said unless they agree to a hike in their rent they will be kicked out. 'As a priority, the government needs to end the freeze on housing benefit so people can still pay their rent. It must also scrap no-fault evictions as quickly as possible to prevent more people from losing their homes unnecessarily, and the additional financial hardship that brings.' Peter Grigg, chief Executive of Home-Start UK, said: 'As a minimum, the government should ensure benefits rise in line with the cost of living. Benefits are rising by 3.1 per cent, but inflation is around 8 per cent and prices and energy bills rising even higher. 'So for low-income families this all means an income drop. If we can't find ways to reduce bills and increase financial support for families, it will be pushing even more parents and children into poverty. Our children deserve better.' Emma Revie, chief executive of the Trussell Trust, said: 'We are calling on the UK government to bring benefits in line with the true cost of living. As an urgent first step benefits should be increased by at least 7 per cent. 'In the longer term, we need the government to introduce a commitment in the benefits system to ensure that everyone has enough money in their pockets to be prevented from falling into destitution. By failing to make benefits payments realistic for the times we face, the government now risks turning the cost of living crisis into a national emergency.' Isabel Hughes of the Food Foundation said: 'A commitment to a new Food Bill would have demonstrated that the government was serious about tackling the problems in the food system and making sustainable long-term action to reduce spiralling food insecurity levels a priority. Families need and deserve more support.'  The economist's view HuffPost UK also asked the highly-respected Resolution Foundation for its view on what the government could be doing, but is currently failing to. Mike Brewer, the think tank's chief economist, agreed with the charities that the benefits system must be mobilised to help the poorest in the country before it's too late. He said: 'With average incomes on course to fall by around PS1,200 this year - the tightest squeeze in half a century - new support will need to be bold. 'Another big rise in the energy price cap this October means that further help with energy bills is inevitable. And while further universal support will be welcome, the Government must also target support at the low-and-middle income families who are at the sharp end of rising cost pressures. 'The most effective way to do this is to bring forward the big increase in benefits due next spring to this autumn, or even sooner if possible. This would deliver significant cash support to millions of hard-hit households, hold back rising poverty levels and would carry no long-term cost to the Treasury.'

Influenza spikes in the winter months, as do infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenoviruses and other coronaviruses. Earlier this year, Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said she expects Covid to also become a seasonal illness - but whether or not that will come to be remains to be seen.  Most scientists agree that Covid isn't going anywhere, and that we'll be living with SARS-CoV-2 for decades, if not forever. Though we tend to see the biggest waves in the winter and early spring, Covid isn't seasonal yet. It doesn't retreat in the spring-to-summer off-season - it is smoldering throughout the year.  'Covid is steadily burning through the population as we speak. But it is also able to piggy back on top of our ebbs and flows of the typical cold and flu season, so it's a double whammy,' Mark Cameron, an infectious disease researcher at Case Western Reserve, tells HuffPost.  Will Covid ever become a seasonal illness? Andrew Noymer, an epidemiologist and demographer who studies infectious diseases at University of California, Irvine, expects Covid to become winter-dominant, like the flu, in the long run. SARS-CoV-2 is already somewhat seasonal and predictable in nature.  'In the United States, all of the largest spikes have been in the winter, so it is kind of seasonal in that respect,' Noymer says.  But, even between those peaks, the virus spreads at pretty significant levels. It hasn't totally settled into a seasonality. Many epidemiologists thought Covid would have already fallen into much more of a seasonal pattern by now - but it hasn't.  'A seasonal infectious disease is something that pops up predictably at the start of the cold and flu season and persists throughout that period of time,' Cameron says.  Keep in mind, this is only our third 12-month period with Covid. The illness is still relatively new. Even though over half of the US population and seven in 10 people in the UK have likely already had Covid, others have not and remain susceptible. We're all antsy for the virus to become predictable, but the virus is still just getting started, Noymer says. He suspects that one day - maybe 10, 15 years from now - we'll be looking at a very seasonal phenomenon. Is there a chance Covid may never sync up with the flu and cold season and become a winter-dominant illness? Of course, Noymer says. 'I can't absolutely rule out that it never will - that it will be the one exception that disproves the rule.' The fact that, one, people can get Covid multiple times, and two, that even vaccinated people can catch and spread Covid, makes the epidemiology of this respiratory infection chaotic. Population-level immunity influences when waves occur. After people recover from Covid, they are typically protected from infection for a few months. As time passes, those recently recovered people can become susceptible again. And, on a greater scale, a population can become susceptible to a wave again.  This isn't an exact science - people get infected and recover at different times. Their immunity wanes at different speeds. 'There's a lot of wheels turning and it's very hard to predict,' Noymer says.  Here's what causes respiratory viruses to become seasonal It's not entirely clear why respiratory viruses tend to get more active in the wintertime - but they do. Flu activity surges in the winter as do the common cold coronaviruses. Even measles was winter-dominant when it circulated at higher levels in the US, according to Noymer.  'We see this with respiratory virus after respiratory virus after respiratory virus,' Noymer says. There are a few hypotheses as to why this happens. The first theory is atmospheric conditions - viruses, including influenza, tend to spread more easily when there's less humidity. Viruses do better in drier conditions. Another contributing factor is our behaviour. In winter months, when it's cold outside, we gather indoors together and create plenty of opportunities for viruses to spread from person to person.  Incidentally, this is also believed to be why the US South experiences summer spikes. Contrary to those in the northeast, people living in southern states head indoors during the summer months when the temperature soars and humidity becomes wet and sticky. Schools are thought to contribute to the seasonal spread of respiratory viruses like flu and RSV, Noymer adds.  The behaviour of the virus plays a role, too. The flu, for example, tends to shoot through the population then burn itself out by 'mutating to its demise,' Cameron said. Covid, on the other hand, is evolving to become more fit and more transmissible - it's not acting like a typical respiratory virus that infects people and goes away before bursting back into the population in a different form months later.  If we look to other circulating coronaviruses that cause the common cold, we can reasonably expect Covid to eventually become endemic and more seasonal in nature, according to Cameron. But we don't know when those coronaviruses settled in their seasonality. How long that will take with Covid is a mystery. This is wide-open territory that has yet to be studied.  'How can we understand how long Covid will take to become just another garden-variety coronavirus that is circulating and causing sporadic disease?' Cameron said. 'It certainly isn't now.'  Experts are still learning about Covid-19. The information in this story is what was known or available at the time of publication, but guidance could change as scientists discover more about the virus.

Does the relationship feel stable and safe enough to take that step? Is your child emotionally ready to meet someone new since you split from your co-parent? What will your ex say?  The stress doesn't end there; once the introductions have been made, you need to check in with your kids to make sure it's all not too much, too fast, and that they're comfortable around your new partner.  This common post-divorce dilemma has played out on a very public stage in recent months, since reality star Kim Kardashian has started dating Saturday Night Livekim comedian Pete Davidson. Things seem to be going swimmingly for the new couple, but Kardashian's ex, Kanye West, has expressed concern about Davidson's relationship with his kids. (At one point West even dramatically wrote, 'NO YOU WILL NEVER MEET MY CHILDREN' on an Instagram post.)  Still, photos taken recently show that Davidson has met the couple's kids. And earlier this month, another photo popped up showing what appears to be a new tattoo for the comedian: The ink reads KNSCP, letters many fans believe stand for Kardashian's four children with West: North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm. If the tattoo is real - and Davidson does have a history of getting tattoos for the women in his life, including a branding in dedication to Kardashian - it's a showy display of commitment on his part. Family therapists we spoke to wondered just how committed a person could be after roughly six months of dating. 'The tattoo seems more like evidence of his impulsivity rather than his genuine attachment to his girlfriend's kids, which he could not possibly have in any substantive way after only six months,' says Virginia Gilbert, a Los Angeles-based therapist specialising in high-conflict divorce. 'I think six months is too soon to meet her kids, especially with an in-process messy divorce and Kanye being so opposed to the meeting, but everything Kim does is in the public eye, it would have been hard to keep Pete a secret, so the question is probably moot,' she added.  Kurt Smith, a family therapist in Roseville, California, who mostly works with men, says that the desire to connect deeper with your significant other by showing interest in their kids is understandable. Ultimately, though, new partners need to recognise that it's a delicate dance -- one that usually requires a healthy distance. 'Pete should be asking himself why that was so important for him to do at this stage of the relationship,' he says.  Since this co-parenting quandary is top of mind for many right now, we decided to ask family therapists and other experts on blended families to share the advice they'd give to parents newly dating again like Kardashian. Here's what they say.  First off, when should introductions be made? For divorced parents, when to introduce and involve a new partner in children's lives is a complex question, with no 'one size fits all' answer. For some people, six months is enough; for others, a slower approach might be necessary, says Dawn O. Braithwaite, a professor of communication studies at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Braithwaite has spent her career studying how families interact to create, navigate and change relationships, routines and traditions, especially in stepfamilies and chosen families. According to her, parents need to consider the following six things before making introductions:   What they believe will be the future of their new relationship   The age of the children   How long it's been since the separation or divorce   How well children have adjusted to changes in their family situation   The relationship with the co-parent   The interest the new partner has in meeting the kids   'While there are exceptions, most scholars have found that new partners can play a positive role in children's lives, but that they should go slow and act as a friend for children rather than overstepping and acting in ways that are confusing or inappropriate for children,' the professor says.  Meetups should be casual at first To avoid coming on too strong or overstepping boundaries, keep those early getting-to-know-you meetups as casual as possible: Arrange a park date or meet up for a Marvel movie and pizza. 'The onus needs to be on the new partner to meet the kids where they are -- meaning you need to participate in the kinds of things they like to do,' Gilbert says. 'I would also suggest postponing adult sleepovers until the kids become comfortable with the new partner.' Remember that your relationship is not with your partner's kids -- it's with your partner only If you're the parent, reinforce that you're not a package deal - not yet, anyway. 'Maintaining this boundary is important for both partners, the health of the new relationship, and, most importantly, for the kids' health,' Smith says.  Move too quickly and you could quickly incur the annoyance of the kids -- and the potential ire of the other parent. 'I've counselled divorcing parents where his new girlfriend posted pics on social media of his kids at a birthday party like they were her own and believe me, it did not go over well with the other parent,' Smith says. 'It's hard enough bringing in new partners and blending families, so avoiding anything that could cause tension or conflict should be avoided,' he explained. Be comfortable being an outsider for a while. Kids in situations like this are usually grappling with competing, confusing concerns, says Amy Begel, a family therapist in private practice in New York City and author of the blog Most Human: 'Will they betray their father if they have a relationship with this new guy? Will they betray their mother if they are loyal to their father and want to protect his feelings?'  That's why it's important to take a backseat for a bit if you're the new partner. It may feel like a blow to the ego to be treated as marginal, or worse, an intruder, but patience during this process is crucial, Begel says.  As Jenna Korf, a stepmom and founder of StepmomHelp.com, previously told HuffPost, you're an outsider joining an already-formed family - even if your partner and their kids eventually move into your home. 'A lot of this is unintentional, but kids automatically go to their parent,' she says. 'You might be sitting right next to your partner and they won't address you, often leaving you out of the conversation.'  If you're the new partner, take the approach of a new friend or neighbour, not an automatic stepparent.  New partners should try to befriend the kids, but move at a pace determined by the kids, says Ron Deal, the founder of SmartStepfamilies.com and author of a number of popular books on blended families. 'In my book with Dr. Gary Chapman, Building Love Together in Blended Families, I tell stepparents it's like making friends with a new neighbour,' Deal says. 'You don't just push your way into their house and tell them you're their new BFF. That makes enemies.' Instead, the stepdad and author advised, you knock and wait patiently on the doorstep. 'You may even have to talk to them through the door for a while until you find a few things you have in common. Only when they open it can you begin to connect face to face,' Deal says. 'Slowly, over time, a friendship is made that stands on its own terms.' Avoid 'erase and replace' messages if you're the new partner  According to Deal, exaggerated gestures like Davidson's tattoos send the wrong message to kids. The goal for new partners is to come across as additive rather than substitutive. The kids should feel like they're potentially adding to the family, not getting a substitute dad or mum. 'Pete's tattoo may sound romantic - that's the kind of thing people do to win the affections of their dating partner - but to the children it declares, 'You're mine.'' Deal says. 'Someone might say, but isn't that great as well? Not necessarily to a child. In their world, it may seem like Pete is trying to 'erase and replace' their father.' A child's loyalty lies, understandably, with their biological parent, not the new stepparent. A message like that threatens their relationship with their father 'may partially explain Kanye's strong reaction and only escalates the battle between the parents,' Deal tells HuffPost. 'Here's my rule of thumb: a new partner who tries to erase and replace a biological parent is, in fact, going to be erased and replaced themselves,' he says. Most kids with newly divorced parents are dealing with abandonment issues; don't add to them It's awful for a child to get attached to a new partner who then disappears from their lives. If your partner is coming on too strong with the kids, Gilbert says to acknowledge that this is a tough transition for everyone and tell them you really appreciate their efforts. Then, shift the conversation: Try to encourage them to see things from the kids' perspective: Among other things, your kids may be feeling extra loyal to your ex or they may be experiencing grief that their parents are no longer together. They may not want to share you with a new person and they may not want someone to have control over changes in their lives. 'Your new partner needs to understand how overwhelming your relationship might feel to the kids and that their ambivalence is not about them,' Gilbert says. 'If the issue is creating conflict between you and your new partner, consider seeing a therapist who can help you both make child-centred decisions.' The big takeaway here, though, is to take things slow: 'As a general rule, it takes at least two years before a new partner can assume any sort of traditional parenting role,' Gilbert says.", "c0aa57c6607e7ec35a1234f7866703e2fd203684346a3cb1290ba80e": "One of the only good things to come out of 2020 (we're sure we don't need to remind you that there really were not many) was Normal People.  The BBC's adaptation of Sally Rooney's best-selling novel charting the love story of teenagers Marianne and Connell was lauded by viewers and critics when it was released during the first lockdown, and made overnight stars of its leads Daisy Edgar-Jones and Paul Mescal.  And while it doesn't look like fans will be getting a second series, that's OK, because this week sees the arrival of Conversations With Friends. Adapted from another of Sally Rooney's hit books, the 12-part series is set to be your new obsession - here's what we can tell you about it... What is Conversations With Friends about? An official synopsis reads: 'Frances is observant, cerebral and sharp. Her ex-girlfriend, now best friend, Bobbi is self-assured, outspoken and compelling. Though they broke up three years ago, Frances and Bobbi are virtually inseparable and perform spoken word poetry together in Dublin. It's at one of their shows that they meet Melissa, an older writer, who is fascinated by the pair.  'Bobbi and Frances start to spend time with Melissa and her husband, Nick, a handsome but reserved actor. While Melissa and Bobbi flirt with each other openly, Nick and Frances embark on an intense, secret affair that is surprising to them both. Soon the affair begins to test the bond between Frances and Bobbi, forcing Frances to reconsider her sense of self, and the friendship she holds so dear.' Who is in the cast of Conversations With Friends? Screen newcomer Alison Oliver plays Frances, an English student and aspiring writer studying at Trinity College in Dublin, who also performs spoken word poetry with her best friend (and ex-girlfriend), Bobbi, with whom she has an intense friendship.  Frances is described as 'smart, sharp and observant', with Alison saying of her character: 'When we meet Frances at this point in her life she's stuck in a lot of patterns of behaviour, and there's a lot of change happening within her relationships with Bobbi, her dad, her own identity and changes within her body that she's having to figure out. 'It's putting her in situations where she has to confront her own vulnerabilities and defences, and confront life in a sense, which is something she's always trying to avoid. It's a tricky time for her, but it's very compelling to observe.' Sasha Lane (Loki, Utopia, American Honey) plays Bobbi, Frances' best friend, who she remains inseparable with, despite their romantic break-up years prior. Bobbi is 'undeniably cool and charming' and is drawn to Melissa - played by Jemima Kirke (Girls, Sex Education) - a married successful writer.  'I feel Melissa is like a spark to her,' Sasha says of her character, Bobbi. '[Melissa's] clearly intelligent and when they first meet, she radiates strong energy, I think she's the opposite to some of the people she hangs around with, so I think Bobbi is attracted to the fact that there's someone who is as big of a mountain as her.' Melissa's husband Nick is played by Joe Alwyn (A Christmas Carol, The Favourite) who is described as 'reserved and insecure'. When we first meet the couple, they are seemingly in a strange place in their relationship, with 'lots of cracks' lying beneath the surface.  'They are functioning but there's no real warmth, love or spark between them that there might have once been,' Joe says, with Melissa adding that Nick is 'passive enough to allow just about anything, even an affair'. However, he soon develops an undeniable chemistry with Frances.  Also among the cast are Justine Mitchell (Cheat, Finding Joy) and Tommy Tiernan (Derry Girls, Small Potatoes) as Frances' divorced parents Paula and Dennis.  Alex Murphy (The Young Offenders) stars as Philip, a friend of Frances and Bobbi's who gets Frances her summer internship, while Tadhg Murphy (Brassic, Absentia) and Sallay Garnett (Striking Out, Finding Joy) play couple Derek and Evelyn, who are close friends of Nick and Melissa.  Kerry Fox (Shallow Grave) also stars as Melissa's mentor and agent Valerie, who also owns the Croatian holiday villa that serves as one of the settings in the series.  How is it different from Normal People? Being the second BBC adaptation from Sally Rooney, Conversations With Friends is bound to draw comparisons to its predecessor Normal People.  While there are some common themes of relationships and coming of age, executive producer and director Lenny Ambrahamson explains how it is different to Marianne and Connell's more traditional love story.  'In Conversations with Friends, you have a much more varied set of relationships and a complex story with a single focus, which is Frances,' Lenny says.  'It's more of a coming-of-age story than anything else but that story is told through these relationships she has with Bobbi, Nick and Melissa. In an interesting way, it's a messier and complicated story which doesn't give easy solutions or conclusions.' While the world the characters inhabit is 'similar' in both dramas, Conversation With Friends has a 'different visual palette' than Normal People and was shot on 35mm film.  'It's probably more adult and grown up,' says executive producer Ed Guiney. 'The nature of the story is more about the challenges of being an adult, it lives more in that world than Normal People did.' He added of shooting on film: 'It gives it a texture, quality and a beauty which is very particular to the show.' However, like Normal People, Conversations With Friends will be told in 12 half-hour episodes.  Originally, Conversations With Friends had been developed as a feature film with BBC Films, but explaining how that changed, Ed says: 'We commissioned a script and were working away on that when the book for Normal People came out and we were lucky enough to become involved in making that as a TV series. 'It was through the process of making Normal People that we understood the way to make Conversations with Friends was also as a TV series.' How faithful is the TV adaptation of Conversation With Friends to the book? According to executive producer Emma Norton, Conversations with Friends was 'much harder to adapt' than Normal People, which she says served as a good way of learning how to adapt the second drama. 'It's a very different book, written in the first person and with a much more complex narrative line running through it,' she says.  'Bobbi, Melissa and Nick are described through Frances, but in the show, the audience sees those characters with their own eyes. We had to work out what that would look like when it wasn't just Frances inflecting those characters. We had to work out what they would say, not just what she'd heard them say.  'There was a lot of filling in that was different to Normal People, as that moved between two characters and two story strands, you didn't have one person's viewpoint shaping that.'  Alison, who plays Frances, says the series will remain faithful to the book, though, despite some things being translated slightly differently for TV.  'The heart of all the characters remains completely intact,' she says. 'I think with any adaptation there's things that will work in a book but then when they are translated into a visual form might not have the same effect, so there's slight differences but the narrative and Sally's tone remain true and present throughout.' When can I watch Conversations With Friends? All episodes of Conversations With Friends will drop together as a boxset on BBC iPlayer on 15 May at 10pm, also airing on BBC Three and BBC One. It will also air in the US on streaming service Hulu.", "eaeff752961ad719d583da62159d4f37e01b545f53e5b58f5efc77a9": "No Eurovision party is complete without a banging playlist - and we've got just the thing for you. We've been speaking to former winners and other famous faces from the iconic song contest about their all-time favourite songs from the Eurovision back catalogue, which we've compiled into a handy playlist ahead of this weekend's festivities. Here are some of the all-time Eurovision greats as chosen by legends from the contest like Katrina, Alexander Rybak, Loreen and Mans Zelmerlow... Rise Like A Phoenix - Conchita Wurst Chosen by Cheryl Baker 'Rise Like A Phoenix is such a powerful song, Conchita is fantastic and she sang it brilliantly. I love that whole build-up to the chorus, the expectation of where's it going to go, it's wonderful. 'And, of course, in the end Conchita was the phoenix, wasn't she?' Soldi - Mahmood Chosen by Mans Zelerlow 'Soldi stands out because Mahmood was so laidback and cool. When a song hits you as much as Soldi did, in a language you don't understand, and you still sing along to it, that gives a singer extra points in my book. And the signature hand-clap [stands out]. 'The fact that I was there that year makes it more special too, I think. When we went out afterwards, at every club we were at we just wanted to hear Soldi.' Euphoria - Loreen Chosen by Dai Freyr 'This song changed a lot of people's perspectives on Eurovision, and how you can use the platform to do different kinds of performances. It's just an explosion of a pop song. 'And also the performance on the stage was really powerful. In order to do well in Eurovision, to have a good song is one thing, but you have to really capture a moment. But that doesn't necessarily mean you need to do all the confetti and the pyro... you just need to capture the moment.' Fuego - Eleni Foureira Chosen by Mahmood 'I was at a club in Tel Aviv after Eurovision in 2019, and everybody was dancing. At one point they played Fuego by Eleni Foureira, and it was massive! People went crazy, and I remember dancing like crazy to that.' Heroes - Mans Zelmerlow Chosen by Loreen 'If I had heard Heroes before Mans Zelmerlow, I would honestly have taken that song for myself! I love it. 'Mans and I have a very special connection. He has a very special place in my heart - he's a Gemini, so of course, he has - and when he did Heroes at Eurovision, everything was perfect.' Hard Rock Hallelujah - Lordi Chosen by Sam Ryder 'My favourite Eurovision moment ever was Lordi's Hard Rock Hallelujah. I was just starting to learn the guitar around that time. And seeing them on stage, in their prosthetics and big platform shoes, bat wings and battleaxes, what's not to like about that?' Dancing Lasha Tumbai - Verka Serduchka Chosen by Dai Freyr 'This song [represents] so much of of what I love about Eurovision. It's just fun and ridiculous and you don't really see that anywhere else, especially on a huge stage with so much production. It's just a crazy song, with crazy costumes and a crazy dance, it's just fun. 'Also, I love how iconic Verka Serduchka is, and how the Eurovision community has really embraced her as a god of Eurovision.' Jan Jan - Inga & Anush Chosen by Mans Zelmerlow 'I just remember this very well, and I loved it so much. It had kind of traditional vibes, but was still very catchy. They were really good.' Nocturne - Secret Garden Chosen by SuRie 'I love the quirky ones. The fact that an instrumental, cinematic soundscape of a track can win at Eurovision is just amazing.' Eres Tu - Mocedades Chosen by Katrina 'This is a very, very moving song, I've got goosebumps talking about it. Sweet, moving and anthemic, with a beautiful, beautiful melody.' Amar Pelos Dois - Salvador Sobral Chosen by Alexander Rybank 'Heroes by Mans Zelmerlow is beautiful because it's perfect. And Amar Pelos Dois is beautiful because it's imperfect.' Divine - Sebastien Tellier Chosen by Dai Freyr 'Sebastien Tellier was definitely an influence on me. He is, I think, the artist that I discovered through Eurovision and listened to the most afterwards. I just really enjoy his music in general, and I first heard about him through Eurovision. 'His song Divine is something different. It's catchy, there's a lot of emotion to it, but it's still quirky and weird.' Follia D'Amore - Rapahel Gualazzi Chosen by Mahmood 'I love that song. It was a little bit jazzy, and I love jazz. In Italy, it's not so popular, so when Rapahel Gualazzi represented with a pop-jazzy song, for me, he felt like a kind of innovator.' Arcade - Duncan Laurence Chosen by SuRie 'There can be a strength in stillness and simplicity, and songwriting rising to the top in this theatrical spectacle of a show. Arcade is a beautiful song.' Waterloo - ABBA Chosen by Loreen 'Waterloo just reminds me of my childhood. We listened to it all the time, and I just loved the way ABBA dressed!' Puppet On A String - Sandie Shaw Chosen by Cheryl Baker 'I remember Sandie Shaw winning in 1967. I was a young girl then, and because I was a runner, I wanted to win an Olympic gold medal, that was my ultimate aim. But when I saw Sandie Shaw win the Eurovision, I thought, 'oh my word, that's what I want to do, I want to win the Eurovision Song Contest for my country'. 'And this young kid from Bethnal Green, east London, living in a council flat, with a dream like that, to think that it actually happened is pretty bloody fantastic, to be honest.'

But with so many acts competing every year, it's inevitable that some will be less memorable than others - and it turns out that includes some pretty famous faces. As we get ready for this year's crop of performances, here are 11 musicians you'd completely forgotten once competed at the Eurovision Song Contest... Jedward Represented: Ireland Year: 2011 and 2012 How did they do? Eighth and 19th place, respectively Best known for annoying Simon Cowell on The X Factor back in 2008, Jedward made a colourful return to our screens as the representatives for Ireland at Eurovision with the surprisingly catchy Lipstick. A year later, they returned to the contest with the surprisingly-even-catchier Waterline. However, they didn't fare quite as well second time around, and are yet to make it a Eurovision hat-trick (though knowing Eurovision - and Jedward - we wouldn't rule that out). Since competing, Jedward have continued making music, as well as appearing on Celebrity Big Brother (twice!) and a recent season of Celebrity Coach Trip, where they butted heads with their fellow passengers. Samantha Womack Represented: UK Year: 1991 How did she do? Joint 10th place Long before we knew her as EastEnders' Ronnie Mitchell, Samantha Womack - or Janus, as she was then known - had embarked on a singing career, making it all the way to Eurovision in 1991. Her song A Message To Your Heart ended up being her only single, after landing just within the top 10 at the contest that year, where she was supported on backing vocals by none other than Hazell Dean. Michael Ball Represented: UK Year: 1992 How did he do? Second place A year after Samantha, we sent West End staple Michael Ball to Malmo, where he seriously impressed and finished in a respectable second place. While Michael may now be best known for his rendition of weepy ballads, his Eurovision offering One Step Out Of Time was a bit more of a toe-tapper. And if you don't believe us, you can check out his *ahem* energetic performance in the video above. Nice moves, Michael!  Blue Represented: UK Year: 2011 How did they do? 11th place The BBC was met with controversy in 2011 when they announced they were ditching their usual Eurovision selection shows and would instead try and reverse the UK's fortunes by choosing our representatives itself. With a string of hits to their name in the 2000s (including three number ones), we sort of get what the BBC was going for when Blue were selected, and at one stage it looked like they were actually going to do quite well. Unfortunately, on the night things didn't quite go to plan, and while 11th place is nothing to be sniffed at, Blue fell short of some people's expectations. Still, that was nothing compared to what would befall the UK at Eurovision in the decade to come... Cascada Represented: Germany Year: 2013 How did they do? 21st place Who doesn't love a bit of Cascada on a night out, eh? Everytime We Touch, Evacuate The Dancefloor, What Hurts The Most - all indisputable bops. Still, it has to be said that what they turned out at Eurovision in 2013 didn't quite hit the mark, and they ended up falling near the bottom of the leaderboard on the night with just 18 points (to put that in perspective, the night's winner Emmelie de Forest had 281). Darude Represented: Finland Year: 2019 How did he do? Failed to qualify past the semi-finals Darude is known for his huge club bangers, so people were really intrigued when it was announced he'd be teaming up with Sebastian Rejman to compete at Eurovision. Unfortunately, the song failed to cause a storm, sandy or otherwise. After their performance in the semi-finals, Darude and Sebastian failed to secure enough votes to make it through to the final stage of the competition. If it's any consolation, Darude, Finland is one of Eurovision's unluckiest entrants, finishing last on eight separate occasions, three of which were with the unenviable nul points. Julio Iglesias Represented: Spain Year: 1970 How did he do? Fourth place The legendary crooner (and dad to fellow singer Enrique Iglesias) was already a big star when he agreed to compete on behalf of Spain at Eurovision in 1970. His song Gwendolyne was one of the night's biggest successes, landing comfortably within the top five on the scoreboard, with Ireland achieving one of their record-breaking seven wins that year. Olivia Newton-John Represented: UK Year: 1974 How did she do? Fourth place The UK really thought they had it in the bag in 1974 when they sent Olivia Newton-John to the contest. Olivia was already a popular singer by this stage, with a string of UK hits, though this was still years before she'd shoot to international stardom in Grease. What the UK hadn't banked on was the popularity of a certain Swedish act by the name of ABBA. The story goes that the UK jury even went as far as allegedly giving the band's offering Waterloo zero points, as a tactical move to boost Olivia's Long Live Love higher up the scoreboard. If that's true, it was all in vain. Waterloo stormed ahead regardless, going on to become one of the most recognisable Eurovision hits ever, while ABBA would only go from strength to strength from that point on. Celine Dion Represented: Switzerland Year: 1988 How did she do? First place Alongside ABBA, Celine Dion is undoubtedly one of Eurovision's biggest ever success stories, to the point many don't even know that's where she got her international break. Long before Titanic, Las Vegas and the Met Gala came calling, the Canadian star performed her French-language song Ne Partez Pas Sans Moi on behalf of Switzerland, beating the UK's entry by just one point. Since then, Celine has become world-renowned as one of the best vocalists of a generation, continuing to perform all over the world. Lucia Moniz Represented: Portugal Year: 1996 How did she do? Sixth place You may think you're not familiar with Lucia Moniz, but there's actually every chance you sit down to watch her every festive season. Although best known as a singer in her home country of Portugal, rom-com fans might recognise Lucia as Aurelia, the love interest of Colin Firth, in the Christmas classic Love Actually. Domenico Modugno Represented: Italy Year: 1958 How did he do? Third place Again, even if you think you're not familiar with Domenico Modugno, we promise you'll know his song Nel Blu, Dipinto Di Blu, perhaps better known as Volare. Although Domenico only took the bronze in 1958 at the third ever Eurovision, his song has definitely stood the test of time, even scooping both Record Of The Year and Song Of The Year at the inaugural Grammys. It's also been covered by everyone from Dean Martin to the Gipsy Kings. Give the song a play and we guarantee you'll have heard it - even if it is just while waiting for your pizza at a Frankie & Benny's somewhere.", "3fcd8d768781035f0beeacc0c15b68700d0485e3dea0fbca451f8ba2": "A dark, empty stage. Sudden flashing lights. Then, from nowhere, an ear-splitting siren that was heard around the globe. That's how Swedish singer Loreen began her performance at the Eurovision Song Contest a decade ago. The first time viewers saw Loreen, she was almost completely in darkness, barefoot and with her thick fringe down to her eyes, singing the opening lines of her song Euphoria. Over the next three minutes, her performance would incorporate strobe effects, a fake snowstorm and choreography reminiscent of martial arts.  All of this helped make Euphoria an immediately-iconic performance, and gave Sweden the runaway win at the competition that year. It also changed Eurovision in ways that are still being felt in 2022. Before she became one of Eurovision's most recognisable contestants, Loreen freely admits she didn't have much of a grasp of what the competition was about. 'I was a hippie,' she tells HuffPost UK. 'I wasn't aware of Eurovision, I didn't even own a television at that time. 'My life was basically about being in a spiritual place where I could meditate and work on that at that time. Media, television and everything, that was not even in my sphere, and especially not competitions.' When Eurovision entered her world, Loreen had already had a few brushes with the music industry. After finishing in fourth place in her native Sweden's version of Pop Idol in 2004, she competed in Melodifestivalen - the Swedish selection show, which is watched by around half of the population - for the first time in 2011, the year before her actual win However, Loreen notes that these past experiences had left her feeling a little dissatisfied. 'A lot of things I did before Eurovision were a compromise, basically,' she explains. 'People having ideas and thoughts about how I should be, and me trying to satisfy that. 'We see you like this', 'we see you like that', and I was just like, 'OK, OK, OK'. And it was painful to do that.' That's why, she says, when Eurovision came along, it was imperative that she took on creative control and create the performance herself - without having to present to anyone before it was fully realised. As she puts it: 'Nobody knew anything. They didn't know what I'd created. And they were scared as fuck. 'Basically, this was my first performance that was actually a reflection of something that was really me. I wanted to prove that if you create something authentic, no matter what it is, if it comes from a real place, people will feel it. That was my main goal.' However, this journey to a truly 'authentic' performance was not an easy one for Loreen. 'It was scary as fuck,' the singer recalls. 'You feel so alone in that moment when you believe in something that nobody else believes in.' Loreen remembers 'a lot of pushback' from 'all the people that had some financial interest in me', who came with their own suggestions of how to improve a performance she had put her heart and soul into - which would ultimately have taken away so many of the aspects of what made Euphoria so iconic. 'It was never aggressive, but it was still there,' she says. 'Their ideas were like, 'could you just please wear shoes? Do you really have to be barefoot? Maybe a pair of high heels? Something like that?'. 'Or, 'could you just try to turn up the lights so we can see your face? Or change the look?' - because my fringe was down over my eyes, I don't understand how I could find my way around the stage. 'Could we make the song a little bit less spiritual and more happy? Can we just give you more makeup, maybe some red lipstick?'.'  Things apparently came to a head the day before Loreen's first performance of Euphoria, when she was told outright that one of its most distinctive details was going to have to go. 'The producer said to me, 'we can't have the siren at the beginning',' she says. 'And I told him, 'we need the siren at the beginning to neutralise the space'. He said, 'if you have the siren, you're going to kill the song'. Basically I was told, 'you're jeopardising the whole thing'. 'This was very late, I was exhausted, it was just before midnight, and he said, 'it's never going to work, Loreen'. And so I said, 'it's either the siren or I'm out'.' Loreen got her siren, but admits: 'I remember thinking, 'what have I done? What if it doesn't work?'. You know, all these thoughts you get when you're really hard on your own intuition.' As for the producer in question, he felt rather differently once he saw the finished product. 'To his credit, when he saw the performance he came up to me with tears in his eyes - I know this sounds funky but it really was what happened,' Loreen reveals. 'He was like, 'I don't know what to say, I'm so sorry, this is so beautiful and it doesn't even matter if it wins or not'.' Of course, neither Loreen nor her team had any need to worry. Euphoria went down a storm on the night, beating its nearest competition by almost 100 points and giving Sweden its fifth Eurovision victory. 'I really didn't expect to win,' she insists. 'That was not even important to me at the time. But I can't even describe the spiritual feeling when I did. 'I was standing there, and there was this connection between myself and the crowd, we were all together, we were all one. I know how that sounds - but it was a massive feeling. It was not about 'look at me and what I've created'', it was just a mutual understanding. And it was fucking beautiful.' She continues: 'I was standing there with 50,000 people on the other side and they were so happy... because what I presented was spirituality in a forum where everything is just 'glitter!'. And as a woman, there's 'high heels!' and there's 'sexy!' - and I love that, and I can be that too if I want to - but it was almost as if people had longed for things to be simple and clean and raw.' The impact of Euphoria is still in effect a decade later, and it doesn't feel like a stretch to say that without Loreen, modern-day winners like Jamala, Duncan Laurence and even reigning champions Maneskin may never have had their own moments of Eurovision glory. 'I think it made room for another type of music, another way of doing things, another type of creator,' Loreen says. 'It's OK to be anything, and everybody is welcome in this forum. And that's so fucking cool. 'It just makes me so happy that the vision came true - if we have that energy of, 'I really love this, this makes me happy', that energy is so powerful and it creates change.' However, she's also quick to shut down the suggestion she's any better or more 'credible' than any of the more weird and wonderful acts that have graced the Eurovision stage before her. She explains: 'Not many people know about this, but my upbringing, as a child, was pretty rough. Coming from where I'm from, there's no judgement from me. There's no 'credible' or 'not credible'. 'A lot of journalists at the time that were like, 'aren't you a little bit too 'good' for this forum?' and that made me upset. Like, 'what the fuck are you talking about?'. Or, you know, 'these performers are maybe not so serious?'. How the fuck do you know that? They might have been working on their stuff for their whole life. This is their expression. What gives anyone the right to decide whether it's 'credible' or not?' As the 10th anniversary of her game-changing win approaches, Loreen says she's feeling particularly nostalgic. She says: 'Time is moving too fast. Like, are you fucking kidding me? 10 years? What happened? 'It feels surreal that it's been that long, because I still feel that moment sometimes. It literally feels like it just happened. Although it belongs to the past, it's still very much here with me, and everything that I do. But also I feel thankful because looking back I understand how important it was.' A decade on, Euphoria has more than earned its place in the Eurovision history books, and Loreen says she hopes the message of the song, the performance and the story behind both can still ring true today. 'When you're different you always have to go through this struggle to fight for your ideas or for your own self,' she says. 'It just scares people when somebody says something different, looks different, has something different. It's always like that, there's always this resistance to change. And at the same time, the one thing you can't change is change. 'What the experience taught me, is that if you trust your first intuition, then things will happen. It will work out. You don't have to know how, that's not your job. But it will.' To mark the anniversary, Loreen is gearing up to release her first musical project in some time, led by her new single Neon Lights. 'This era now is about a character I've created called 'the Alpha Lady',' she explains. 'All of these songs starting with Neon Lights are about this 'superwoman'. I'm playing this avatar - a person that I would love to be but am not. She's basically the Euphoria character that has evolved and has turned into a warrior and a soldier, but with good values.' And as for how she'll be marking the 10-year anniversary of Euphoria's win privately? 'I'm going to drink some wine,' she admits with a laugh. 'A couple of bottles.' Loreen's new single Neon Lights is out now.

The prime minister is pushing for a 'rapid return' of officials to their Whitehall desks after working from home became the norm during the pandemic. He widened the call on Friday as he urged businesses to help boost the economy by doing the same as Covid-19 eases.  In an interview with the Daily Mail, Johnson made the case for workers to get back to in-person working.  He said: 'We need to get back into the habit of getting into the office. I believe people are more productive, more energetic, more full of ideas, when they are surrounded by other people. 'My experience of working from home is you spend an awful lot of time making another cup of coffee, and then you know, getting up, walking very slowly to the fridge, hacking off a small piece of cheese, then walking very slowly back to your laptop and then forgetting what it was you're doing.' The PM's WFH 'experience' did not chime with many people on social media.  Last month, Jacob Rees-Mogg - a government minister with responsibility for efficiency - was labelled a 'nasty patronising man' after leaving notes on the desks of civil servants who were not in the office. It read: 'Sorry you were out when I visited. I look forward to seeing you in the office very soon. Wish every good wish.'  Earlier on Friday, Rees-Mogg defended Johnson's plans to slash the number of civil servants by 91,000, arguing the government wanted to bring the Whitehall headcount back to where it was in 2016.

The London mayor made the announcement during a trip to America. Former Labour frontbencher Lord Falconer will chair the new body, which will make recommendations on what more can be done to tackle drug-related crime. But HuffPost UK can reveal that some members of the shadow cabinet, including shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, are furious at Khan's plans, fearing it will allow the Tories to portray Labour as soft on drugs. In the wake of the mayor's announcement, Tory chairman Oliver Dowden sent an email to supporters declaring: 'Will you help stop Sadiq Khan legalising drugs?' 'Yvette is furious about it,' a Labour source said. 'People are just rolling their eyes because it definitely is not the official party line.' Another added: 'There is frustration across the frontbench at being completely blindsided by this. 'We're clear what our position is and our drugs policy position is extremely firm. 'This is not something that Sadiq can change unilaterally because he doesn't have the power to do that as mayor. It beggars belief.' Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting is also understood to be angry at Khan's intervention. However, another Labour source said: 'YouGov says a majority of the public support legalisation of cannabis. 'Sadiq has positioned himself as a progressive mayor on the side of the public prepared to take on the tough questions to genuinely tackle crime rather than pointless posturing that isn't even popular anyway.' Allies of Khan also pointed out that the commission announcement met a pledge contained in his last election manifesto. During his US trip, the London mayor visited a cannabis dispensary in California -- where the drug is legal for medical and recreational use by adults -- which he described as 'fascinating'. While on the trip, Khan told the BBC: 'We need to have an honest, open conversation about the evidence in relation to the history of cannabis and our laws in the UK and our experience of the health consequences in relation to crime and the community.   'The best way to do that will be with the drugs commission we've now set up.    'You can hear from the experts, that's one thing, but seeing it for yourself ... hearing from those who cultivate and grow this plant has been fascinating.' Patel was one of a number of senior Tories who were quick to criticise Khan for his intervention, saying his time would be 'better spent focusing on knife and drug crime in London'. 'The mayor has no powers to legalise drugs,' she tweeted. 'They ruin communities, tear apart families and destroy lives.'

The confrontation took place outside the hospital where mourners, many waving Palestinian flags, picked up Abu Akleh's casket. They intended to march on foot to a church in nearby Old City, as Abu Akleh was a Christian, but were assaulted by Israeli forces.  Video shows the pallbearers being violently shoved to one side of the street, struggling to maintain control of the casket as officers beat and kicked those in the crowd.  Abu Akleh, 51, was shot in the head on Wednesday while covering an Israeli military raid in the occupied West Bank. A colleague who was injured and the Al Jazeera network identified Israeli forces as firing the fatal shot.  After the clash outside the hospital, Abu Akleh's family was permitted to transfer the casket to a vehicle and drive it to a Catholic church in the Old City, The Associated Press reported. Police fired tear gas at those who remained. Even the hearse was not unscathed. Video showed Israeli officers snatching Palestinian flags from the vehicle carrying Abu Akleh's body. Israeli police said in a statement to The New York Times that they took 'enforcement action' after witnessing 'nationalist incitement' during the procession. The violence appalled some in the international community. The Netherlands' ambassador to Israel said he was 'shocked by the disproportionate and disrespectful behavior of the Israeli police'.  At various points in the procession, mourners sang the Palestinian national anthem and chanted things such as 'Palestine, Palestine', 'we die for Palestine to live' and 'our beloved home', according to the AP.  Abu Akleh was a Palestinian and US citizen who had covered life in the disputed lands for decades, becoming a well-known Palestinian journalist. Thousands of people turned up for her funeral in Jerusalem's Old City. Israel claims the whole city as its capital, although much of the world does not recognize it as such due to the ongoing conflict with Palestinians, who hold claim to the eastern part of the city. Earlier this year, Amnesty International joined the human rights groups accusing Israel of perpetuating an apartheid system against Palestinians both within Israel's borders and in disputed territories, including the West Bank.  The day of Abu Akleh's death, she was wearing protective gear identifying her as a member of the press. Other reporters at the scene told AP the journalists had made their presence known to Israeli soldiers. They said they did not see any Palestinian militants, and there were no clashes in the immediate area where Abu Akleh was hit, contradicting claims from the Israeli military that Palestinian fighters had fired hundreds of rounds, some in her direction. US State Department spokesperson Ned Price called Abu Akleh's death 'an affront to media freedom everywhere' and said the investigation must hold responsible parties accountable. The reaction contrasted with the furious US denunciation of Russia in response to journalists killed in the Ukraine war; unlike Russia, Israel is considered an American ally.", "5088898132655021000a0c6b79ee463a063a11b6f884b912832493dd": "Boris Johnson did not apologise to Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe as he met her for the first time since her release from an Iranian prison. The prime minister has been accused of lengthening her ordeal when, as foreign secretary in 2017, he wrongly claimed she had been training journalists at the time of her arrest in 2016. Zaghari-Ratcliffe told the PM his comments had 'a massive impact' on her and that she had 'lived in the shadow of his words' while in prison. Asked afterwards if the prime minister apologised, her husband Richard Ratcliffe responded: 'Not specifically.' However, he insisted it was not an 'abrasive meeting' and that it was 'undeniable' that Mr Johnson was sorry for the impact his mistake had had. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was finally released in March after being detained for nearly six years. Fellow detainee Anoosheh Ashoori was also freed after the UK agreed to settle a historic PS400 million debt to Iran dating to the 1970s Zaghari-Ratcliffe's daughter Gabriella and local constituency MP, Tulip Siddiq, were also present at the Downing Street meeting. Mr Ratcliffe said his wife challenged the Prime Minister on 'why did it take so long' to secure her release. Siddiq, the Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn, said Johnson 'looked quite shocked' when Zaghari-Ratcliffe challenged him. She said: 'I was really proud of Nazanin. She was sitting next to the prime minister, and she told him very clearly and categorically that his words had had a big impact on her and that she had lived in the shadow of his words for the best part of four-and-a-half years. 'I have to say the Prime Minister looked quite shocked, I think, when she said that, but I was really proud she did say that because she wanted to make it clear to him that she's happy now, she's grateful, she appreciates the fact that she is home now, but there was a time when the words had a big impact.' Four days after Mr Johnson's damaging remarks as foreign secretary, Zaghari-ratcliffe was summoned before an unscheduled court hearing, where his comments were cited as proof that she was engaged in 'propaganda against the regime'. A No 10 spokesman replied: 'I think it is important to remember that it was the Iranian government who were responsible for her unfair detention, and the decision to release her was always in their gift.

Party bosses have drawn up a shortlist of two candidates in Wakefield, but the local party's executive quit today in protest at what they perceive to be a 'stitch-up' by Keir Starmer's office. And in a separate blow, the powerful GMB union regional branch also refused to endorse a candidate. The by-election is taking place following the resignation of Tory MP Imran Ahmad Khan who was convicted earlier this month of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy. HuffPost UK revealed on Thursday that Starmer's office had been accused of blocking the deputy leader of Wakefield council's deputy leader, Jack Hemingway, from being the Labour candidate over his previous support for Jeremy Corbyn. The two hopefuls chosen to battle it out to be Labour's candidate are Kate Dearden and Simon Lightwood, who are not from the local area. The move prompted the entire executive of the Wakefield Labour party to resign in protest. In a statement, they said they had asked the central party to plan for the selection early to 'avoid a rushed job' and that they had made it clear they wanted a local candidate. HuffPost UK also understands that shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh, who is leading Labour's by-election campaign, warned party bosses there would be a 'robust response' locally if the shortlist did not include candidates from Wakefield. In a statement on Friday afternoon, the GMB said that despite having a 'proud tradition of campaigning across Yorkshire' it would not back a candidate in the by-election. 'This afternoon we concluded interviews on who to endorse as part of the upcoming selection for Labour candidate in Wakefield,' the union said. 'Both candidates performed well but we have on this occasion decided not to endorse a candidate. 'We wish the candidates well in the upcoming selection and look forward to campaigning for a Labour victory in the upcoming by-election.' Following the announcement a Labour source said: 'Not sure the Leader's Office saw that coming.' They added: 'GMB are generally supportive of Starmer, but they're also not going to let their own people get done over so that one faction or another can win -- they're not really into that. 'It's not how they do things, and there's a big feeling that this just isn't really in the spirit of fairness.' On the issue of the CLP executive resigning, another source said it 'showed the strength of feeling' and that 'working class voters are basically just collateral in political games'. 'Could you really say, as a Labour Party officer in Wakefield right now, to the people you live alongside, that the party is doing the right thing for people in Wakefield?' the source said. 'Or is it doing the right thing for a certain group of people inside the Labour Party?' A Labour Party spokesperson said: 'We're really pleased to have two fantastic candidates on the shortlist with strong connections to the local community. 'On Sunday local members will make the final choice on a candidate who will be a strong champion for Wakefield and represent a fresh start against a backdrop of Tory failure.

One expert said if both sides were in the same situation by September, it would be 'reasonable' to describe it as a stalemate.  They said: 'I can understand why people are describing it in those terms. 'I think, from our point of view, if it continues like this then we can see it ending up as a stalemate. 'I think things are still playing out over the summer months. So if we were to describe a kind of frozen conflict if it was a stalemate in those terms. 'If we were still in this position come September then I think that's a reasonable description. 'Any battle ebbs and flows and we would expect losses and gains on both sides. So the question really is does it come to a tipping point?  'The rate of progress and gains for the Russians seems to have slowed it's certainly not what they would expect and, overall, the battle is finally balanced.' It comes after a US official said the Russian invasion in eastern Ukraine was reaching a stalemate, warning that neither side could win in the present circumstances. Earlier it was revealed that the mistress, ex-wife and family members of Russian President Vladimir Putin had been added to the UK sanctions list. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is targeting the 'shady network propping up' the leader and the announcement will result in his inner circle being hit.  The Foreign Office said Putin's official assets were modest but his lifestyle was 'funded by a cabal of family, friends and elites'.  One of the most high-profile figures on the list is Alina Kabaeva, a retired Olympic gymnast who is widely reported to be Putin's mistress. A UK official described her as having a 'close personal relationship' with the former KGB officer. Unconfirmed reports suggest the 2004 Athens gold medallist has been engaged to the Russian leader and has had his children. Despite officially owning few assets, Putin is said to have displayed a lavish lifestyle, with the Whitehall department pointing to reports exposing links to a PS566 million yacht and a $1 billion 'Putin palace' - officially owned by close associate, Arkady Rotenberg, who was sanctioned in December 2020.  Officials also said Russia was now in the grips of the 'worst recession since the end of the Cold War' after being hit by international sanctions. One expert said: 'Well over 60 per cent of Russia's foreign currency reserves have been frozen, there are continuing reports of Russia being on the brink of defaulting on its foreign debt and confidence in the Russian economy continues to be extremely low. 'Even even though the ruble has to some extent stabilised, estimates for Russia's GDP growth this year range from a drop of 8.5 to 15 per cent. 'And the IMF forecast that the economy will shrink quite significantly further in 2023. This is the worst recession since the end of the Cold War. It is a huge crash for the Russian economy.' On the fact that Russia appeared to be staving off some of the worst predictions about its economy, the official added: 'We don't share the assessment actually that Russia's economy has been resilient. 'What you see at the moment is a kind of veneer perhaps of stabilisation. If you go to Moscow and drink coffee in a nice cafe and you may you may not witness it, but below the surface there is some real panic in the Russian economic system. 'And I think we will continue to see that play through in the coming months as some of the short run effects continue, but also the longer run effects come in as well.'  Also today, Truss urged a meeting of G7 foreign ministers to maintain sanctions against Russia until it has fully withdrawn from Ukraine. The cabinet minister used the meeting in Germany on Thursday to urge for rolling sanctions until all troops have left the country. She also said a 'clear pathway to Nato-standard equipment' needed to remain in place for Kyiv if it was to secure long-term security in the face of Russian aggression.

Sunak, along with the rest of the government, is facing growing backlash over the cost of living crisis. More than two million Brits have admitted they skip a meal at least once a day just to cut back on costs. Benefits were increased just 3.1% in April, even though inflation, which is at a 30-year-high, has risen to 7% - and it's only expected to get worse as the year progresses. Sunak also refused to postpone his hike in national insurance contributions which kicked in last month. Speaking to Bloomberg UK on Friday morning, the chancellor once again shrugged off calls for the treasury to step in and offer more financial aid to struggling households in light of soaring prices. Instead, he blamed the government's antiquated IT system. He said: 'Technical problems sounds like an excuse, but the operation of our welfare system is actually, technically complicated and it's not necessarily possible to do that for everybody. 'And actually many of the systems are built in a way that can only be done once a year and the decision was taken quite a while ago before we even realised.' When Bloomberg Economics' Stephanie Flanders pointed out: 'You designed the furlough scheme for most of the UK workforce in two weeks.' Sunak replied: 'The welfare system works in a very different way and we are constrained somewhat by the operation of the welfare system, but we are still supporting people.' Not everyone was convinced by his explanation for the treasury's actions. Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, said: 'The chancellor is right that it's very difficult to change benefits outside the usual cycle, particularly for pensions. But these barriers can be overcome.' He also tweeted that the problem is not the treasury's reluctance to spend money, but its refusal to target those 'being hardest hit'.

Sharon Bell, 58, is said to be under the delusional belief that she was in a relationship with the former Manchester United and England footballer, that he and wife Victoria Beckham stole her eggs, and that their 10-year-old daughter is her legitimate child. Bell allegedly sent a series of letters to the Beckhams' homes in Oxford and London before attending the addresses in July and September last year. Westminster Magistrates' Court heard that she also turned up at Harper's primary school in a bid to speak to her, and was there when Victoria, 48, arrived to collect her daughter.   Prosecutor Arizuna Asante said of 47-year-old ex-Real Madrid, PSG, AC Milan and LA Galaxy star Beckham: 'He felt threatened, he felt frightened for the safety of his family, and he believed this behaviour was targeted and intimidating. 'He says he does not know the defendant and she is not the mother of his children.' Bell, of Boundary Way, Watford, has previously pleaded not guilty to a charge of stalking and faces trial on July 12. She did not attend the hearing on Friday, which heard that she is currently in hospital, where she has been sectioned. Her lawyer, Lisa Wilson, said that if her client is not found by the court to be insane, she wants the Beckhams, who will be on holiday at the time of the trial, to be called as witnesses so they can be questioned about her claims.   The court heard that this would include putting the suggestion to former Spice Girls singer Victoria, who has four children with her husband, 'that she conspired with David Beckham to steal the eggs of Sharon Bell'. However, District Judge Michael Snow said the 'absolutely bizarre assertion' would amount to 'further harassment of the Beckham family' and said it is in the interests of justice that their statements be read. 'There is a risk of the family suffering further harassment, alarm or distress because of delusional allegations being put to them,' he said. The judge extended a civil interim stalking protection order until the end of the proceedings, which he indicated are likely to go down the 'psychiatric route', resulting in a hospital order.", "5249b229cbbd73ef608eff7c3880165448948bc1098cd8d5423c560b": "Hair loss is far more prevalent among men than women and for some, it's a sensitive subject. Now, an employment tribunal has ruled that commenting on someone's baldness in the workplace is a form of sexual harassment.  The ruling - made by a panel of three men - comes after an electrician, Tony Finn, claimed he'd been sexually harassed at the factory where he worked, when he was called a 'bald c**t' during a row with a manager. Interestingly, he wasn't so offended by the expletive, but felt discriminated against due to his appearance.  The panel compared the comments on a male's baldness to commenting on the size of a woman's breasts, saying baldness is 'inherently related to sex'. And although this comparison has sparked some debate, it's also made some men reflect on the interactions they've had in relation to their baldness at work.  Nick Chowdrey, a 33-year-old from London, started to lose his hair when he was 19 and says the decision to shave it off completely was actually 'underwhelming'.  'I walked into work and expected jeers and shock, but mostly I was met with positivity, bar the one toxic masculine sales guy who made a cliche comment like 'get into a fight with a lawnmower?'' he says. 'I haven't ever received any comments in the workplace about it since, but I expect I'm just lucky, having worked in the charity sector for the last five years where toxic masculinity tends not to be so prevalent.' However, he has still read about the tribunal case with interest. 'What I would say is that any form of making fun of someone's appearance in the workplace is clearly harassment and should not happen, especially if coming from a boss to an employee,' he says. 'I do think that the equivalence being made to sexual comments about women is unhelpful outside of the legal context: we're all humans, at the end of the day, and we all bleed the same. Whatever the law is, my clear opinion on this is that bosses, in their privileged position of power, should be building their employees up, not tearing them down.' Jeremy Helm, a 37-year-old financial analyst for MWB Solutions, also thinks the publicity the tribunal is receiving is a good thing. 'I can certainly say that people seem to be more relaxed about insulting certain physical issues, ailments or limitations. People have no issue calling someone tall 'lanky' or someone with red hair 'a ginger', all used maliciously to insult someone based on a characteristic,' he says. 'I'm not sure why rude names are deemed acceptable by anyone to be honest.' Helm started 'balding properly' at 28 and used to feel self-conscious about it at work. 'I did used to hate it when anyone made comments when I was younger. It wasn't a nice thing to go through,' he adds. Today, he's more relaxed about his baldness and will often be the first to make a joke about it if a colleague is going for a haircut. 'Ironically, I go get my haircut the most, as I get bits growing around the sides of my head and nothing in the middle, so I prefer to be completely bald, as I look 10 years younger than when the remaining hairs try popping through,' says Helm, who's based in Cambridge.  'I guess it's about owning the joke, I used to be really self conscious and if anyone said anything I used to feel a little depressed about it. But as I got older I started to care less, I could make jokes about myself more easily and felt more relaxed. 'Settling down and getting married meant I felt more comfortable in myself. I didn't obsess over what others thought as much. 'It's not a laughing matter, I know if I saw a younger me, I'd try and discuss it privately with them.' Others also use humour in relation to their baldness at work. Paul Aitken, 49, from Oxford, started losing his hair aged 20 and was sensitive about it in the early days.  'I did and still put up with light-hearted name-calling - typically 'baldy' or other less polite things from my colleagues - but it's never said maliciously or with aggression,' he says. 'I always take it with the humour that's intended.' Now the chairman of a number of fintech and traditional finance businesses including Suros Capital, Suttons and Robertsons and CasaFi, and an investor in start-ups, he continues: 'I've never let being bald affect my work life, the good-humoured teasing continues and I accept it's just part of who I am.' A few men who got in touch to say they'd never had any interactions at all in the workplace relating to their baldness, including Peter MacCiarrai, 45, from Westcliff-on-Sea. However, he's twice had random women rubbing his head on a night out, which was 'not entirely welcome'. But it's not all bad. Jordan James, a 35-year-old Londoner who works in PR for small businesses at Unlockd Marketing, says his baldness has helped build rapport with certain clients.  'I'm newly bald (before this I had a blonde ponytail) and I've noticed that it's actually helped my relationships with both colleagues and clients,' he says. 'Typically, being bald makes me seem older (and wiser) and I feel like I'm respected more. For many men, it's a right of passage - it shows you've got some experience.'  With fellow bald male clients, it also seems to incite an instant sort of camaraderie. 'It's strengthened my relationships and rapport with them and with some, we've instantly bounded over our lack of hair! People like to deal with people they can relate to,' he says.  'I can't recall a negative experience and it certainly saves on the hair dressing bill!' For men just starting to lose their hair, hearing positive experiences can make a huge difference and Chowdrey says he'd love for more men to be openly proud about their baldness.  'I shudder every time I see a new baldness medication advertised to me in some quirky way on the tube, or on Instagram, as I don't think treating baldness with serious drugs should be normalised. And I worry for the mental health of those men - whose self esteem has been preyed upon to sell them this treatment - who will suffer the mental health impacts of both the drugs and delaying the inevitable loss of their hair,' he says. 'But the fact is, this is an extremely emotional and sensitive area for many men, and I'm happy if those not yet in 'bald nirvana' feel their dignity is more protected by this tribunal decision.'", "8fe3939c1186c46d1f2faca66044027618e26523785ce225d6fc1a26": "In recent years, Sports Illustrated has made a concerted effort to expand the, shall we say, limited perception of female beauty highlighted in its annual Swimsuit issue.  In 2016, the publication featured its first plus-size cover girl, Ashley Graham. In 2019, Halima Aden became the first model to appear in the magazine wearing a hijab. And in 2020, Valentina Sampaio became the first openly transgender model to appear in the issue.  The latest first for the 58-year-old Swimsuit edition? A model proudly showing her visible caesarean section scar. In SI Swimsuit 2022, model Kelly Hughes flashes a big grin and pulls down her bikini bottoms a smidge to reveal a C-section scar above her pelvic bone. The photo feature was done in collaboration with pregnancy and postpartum brand Frida Mom, the first brand to partner with Sports Illustrated Swimsuit under its Pay With Change advertising platform. In a statement, Frida Mom founder Chelsea Hirschhorn said the partnership provides a 'valuable platform to disrupt the traditional narrative around women's bodies -- especially those they feature who are mothers.'  In her Instagram post of the photo, Hughes, who delivered her son via caesarean three years ago, shared her complicated feelings about her C-section scar. 'I struggled with insecurities from my scar being that I'm a model and my incredibly difficult recovery but it wasn't until I embraced my scar that I experienced the true power in it,' she wrote.  Hughes isn't alone in having mixed feelings about her C-section According to the latest research from the World Health Organisation, births by C-section continue to rise globally, now accounting for more than 1 in 5 (21%) of all childbirths. In the US, nearly a third of people who give birth now deliver babies via caesarean section, and they account for one in five UK births. Despite how common the procedure is, many people are left with guilt or shame after having a C-section, especially if their intention going in was to have a vaginal delivery. As Sports Illustrated notes on its site, 'the cultural misconception of labelling C-sections as 'the easy way out'' doesn't help matters.  Then there's the body shame many feel about their visible scars, even years later, said Carla Korn, a psychotherapist and body image expert in Westlake Village, California. 'So many women feel uncomfortable about their scars being on display and make attempts to hide them,' she told HuffPost. Korn thinks seeing a C-section scar in Sports Illustrated 'helps send the message to postpartum women that their scar is nothing to be ashamed of.' For male readers coming across the photo, Korn thinks the message conveyed is just as powerful. (Though if they're familiar with the newer, more inclusive Swimsuit edition - 'Woke Illustrated,' as some have called it - they probably won't be too surprised to see it.) 'I think the photo shows that women's bodies are uniquely capable and magical, especially in how we grow babies and give birth,' she said. 'Our bodies' diversity and perceived imperfections make them even more beautiful.' Melissa Weinberg, a psychotherapist in private practice who specialises in the treatment of anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder, especially during pregnancy and in the postpartum period, loves that the magazine is normalising postpartum bodies.  Still, she wishes the publication had pushed even further.  'It's certainly a step in the right direction, but it's hard to get too excited about photos that completely reinforce every other aspect of unhelpful and unachievable beauty ideals that makes most women, including postpartum women, feel like garbage,' she told HuffPost. As nice as the photo is, it doesn't do much to disrupt the norm of 'thin white cis blond women' being revered for their beauty, she added.  'Will this be the new standard of how postpartum bodies should look? Will a woman who in most ways looks nothing like this model, aside from their shared C-section scars, feel even worse about her postpartum body in comparison?' she asked.  'These photos are really cool, but not enough,' she added. 'We need more diversity and inclusivity.' That being noted, Weinberg said it's always refreshing to see C-sections normalised.  'I hope that these photos send the message to anyone viewing them, men included, that C-sections and the marks they leave are unbelievably common and not something to be hidden, but celebrated, something as normal as freckles,' she said. 'As a society we want to ignore the details - glorious and gory - of such a normal part of the human experience: childbirth.' On social media, the glossy photo has elicited a range of emotions for women who have had C-sections themselves. Some are happily surprised to see scars like theirs shown in the pages of Sports Illustrated. Others have noted that their scars aren't quite as subtle as Hughes' due to a 'classic' vertical incision rather than a side-to-side 'bikini cut,' or that they healed weirdly. Amanda Kammarada, an artist and author who had two C-sections, in 2009 and 2012, was so happy to see the photos featured in a NowThis video, she tweeted it out to her followers.  'It made me feel proud of my scar,' she told HuffPost. 'Seeing that kind of representation in that type of magazine is a really big deal.' If the picture chips away at the stigma associated with C-sections even slightly, Kammarada said she's happy. 'There are some who say that a C-section isn't really 'giving birth,'' she said. 'A woman's body is incredible and there should be no shame in how you have your child.'", "96aefa08807ff42ea3c7ec8ef1a4ad6ef217977e63012f71630fdd47": "The attorney general was put on the spot over the government's handling of the cost of living crisis on Thursday's BBC Question Time, in a clip that makes for toe-curling viewing. Suella Braverman was listing how Downing Street has accounted for the 30-year high inflation rates in its efforts to help alleviate the crisis, when she claimed some families will be '1,600 better off this year compared to last year because of these cumulative changes'. The audience laughed at her claim, while Braverman said: 'Would I love to do more? Of course I would! But we have to pay for our backlogs.' Miatta Fahnbulleh, chief executive of the New Economics Foundation, then cut in and pointed out that even when the government's measures are taken into consideration, families on average are still PS1,100 worse off. She claimed: ''Your numbers are literally made up!' The crowd began to clap in support, as Fahnbulleh continued: 'It doesn't feel like the government has grasped the scale of the challenge, because if you had, you would have acted by now. ''You talk about the lowest families - the chancellor took PS1,000 from those families last year and then in the spring statement we just had there was literally not a single measure that would support families on the lowest incomes in this country. 'And there are things you could do to act, but you're choosing not to,' the economist said, while the attorney general simply shook her head. Fahnbulleh pointed out that the government could employ a windfall tax, along with a great homes upgrade to improve insulation over the next three years. The economist called for a PS15bn package to boost benefits too, so would help families which are 'at the sharp end of this crisis, which the chancellor has left to languish'. Fahnbulleh continued to talk to Braverman - who refused to meet her eye - as she said: 'People are moving well beyond the choice between heating your home or feeding your kids. People are not doing either. 'The fact you're not acting I think is unforgivable.' The government has introduced a number of small measures to address the cost of living crisis including a PS200 energy rebate, the cut and freeze to fuel duty, the household support fund - but critics still believe these proposals don't go far enough. The attorney general's entire Question Time performance went down like a lead balloon, even when the conversation moved away from the cost of living crisis. She was also criticised for her answers over legal queries on the Northern Ireland Protocol, which is now causing fresh friction between the EU and the UK as Downing Street looks to re-write the agreement.", "5ef6f2afc044752cc632e5e15e1c13c7fb19fc66621e68d8da2a49da": "Women who suffer from fibroids will now be able to take an oral tablet that could help them avoid invasive surgery.  Ryeqo pills should be added to the treatment options considered if a woman has moderate to severe symptoms of fibroids, the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has ruled. These symptoms include heavy and painful periods and bloating that makes a woman look pregnant.  NICE says that around 4,500 women with uterine fibroids will be eligible for the pills in England and Wales when they become available in three months. Designed to be taken daily at home, the Ryeqo tablet combines several different medications - relugolix with estradiol and norethisterone acetate - to control symptoms. Tests suggest they are be safe to be take on an ongoing basis without affecting a woman's fertility.   Maria Caulfield, minister for women's health, called it 'a ground-breaking step forward to not only improve women's quality of life and reduce symptoms, but to give them greater choice in the medication available and options for alternative, less invasive treatment.'  What are fibroids?  As Dr Deborah Lee, a sexual and reproductive healthcare doctor from Dr Fox Pharmacy previously explained to HuffPost UK, fibroids are 'benign tumours of small muscle which arise in the wall of the uterus (womb). Each fibroid grows from one individual muscle cell, which grows out of control. As the fibroid enlarges, it presses on any surrounding structures.' While non-cancerous, fibroids can sometimes lead to infertility and they affect one in three women in their lifetime, the NHS says, with Black women are disproportionately impacted. Nearly a quarter of Black women between 18 and 30 have fibroids compared to about 6% of white women, according to some estimates. And by age 35, that number increases to 60%. Despite this, many Black women report it taking months - and in some cases, years - for their symptoms to be taken seriously be medical professionals. What are the signs of fibroids?   Heavy menstrual bleeding   Painful sex   Lower back pain   Abdominal distension (when the abdomen is swollen outwards)    Fatigue   Inter-menstrual bleeding (bleeding between periods)   Fatigue   Urinary symptoms (such as frequent urination or incontinence)    Why is this new so pill important?  The oral tablet will limit how many women need surgery and help them deal with their symptoms. This could be a gamechanger in particular for the many Black women who suffer with fibroids and struggle to get surgery to remove them.  Rasheedat Olarinoye, a 25-year-old civil servant from Slough, recently had a myomectomy to remove her fibroids. It took nine months for her to be diagnosed, and her fibroids got so big, she says she looked six or seven months pregnant. At first she thought it could be something to do with her digestion. She didn't link her stomach issues to her periods, even though she would have painful cramps and often bleed for up to 10 days.  'Uterine fibroids can have a profound effect on quality of life. Along with the many debilitating symptoms, there is a real lack of long-term options,' said Helen Knight, interim director of medicines evaluation in the NICE Centre for Health Technology Evaluation, when announcing the new pill. 'As well as effectively reducing symptoms, it can be taken at home and is therefore more convenient than the injectable treatment, given in a hospital setting. It can also be used long term, which could mean improved and sustained symptom relief, it is well-tolerated, and it will mean thousands of women can avoid invasive surgery which always carries some risk.'   Why are Black women more likely to have fibroids? As Dr Lee previously explained to HuffPost UK, fibroids are sensitive to oestrogen and Black women more commonly possess a specific oestrogen receptor known as the oestrogen receptor-a PP variant, which has also been linked to the presence of fibroids. 'Some research suggest fibroids may be linked to vitamin D deficiency, and Black women are more likely to vitamin D deficient than white women,' she added. 'Vitamin D is an essential vitamin for bone health but it also plays a vital role in regulating the immune system.' Black women's health concerns not being taken seriously due to structural racism is also a factor in low diagnosis rates, Lee stressed. 'In a shockingly recent 2016 study of first and second-year medical students, nearly half believed that Black skin was thicker than white skin and that Black people did not feel so much pain as white people,' she added.

Dowden, the MP for Hertsmere and the Conservative Party chairman, donated a champagne bottle signed by prime minister Boris Johnson for the local charity event which was held on Thursday night - and it was quickly perceived as a joke about the government's breach of Covid rules during the partygate saga. The description, not added by Dowden, reads: 'A bottle of champagne signed by Boris. Hugely valuable as a souvenir of partygate and the exemplary behaviour and morality of our dear leader.' Just below this tongue-in-cheek message, the note adds: 'Donated by Oliver Dowden.' Food critic Jay Rayner tweeted an image of this description, alongside the following caption: 'Perhaps you thought the Conservative Party took partygate seriously.' Twitter users were furious, and Rayner's message had amassed more than 18,000 likes less than two hours after he posted it. But, many people did slightly misunderstand the descriptive note and believed that message itself had come from Dowden. A spokesperson for the minister later cleared this up, telling: 'This item was donated in good faith several months ago for a local charity auction. 'Oliver Dowden had no prior knowledge of the description and this is obviously not his view.' Even so, the photo was published just as efficiency minister Jacob Rees-Mogg dubbed partygate a 'non-story' during his morning media rounds and a day after Scotland Yard confirmed that it has now issued more than 100 fines over the Downing Street lockdown gatherings.", "b7120b3b21d7f72f25ad9c6b71a608c93a0169a5a37ca1752c9a5241": "A Tory MP has accused No.10 of 'spewing out' sensationalist headlines, after Boris Johnson demanded cuts of up to 91,000 civil service jobs. Tobias Ellwood, a critic of Johnson, slammed the proposed cuts, saying it was 'not about numbers' but about the 'engine' driving policy.  He quipped that he was starting to think Downing Street had created a 'Dead Cat Committee' - referring to a political strategy to divert media from failures in other areas.  The chairman of the commons defence committee, who previously submitted a letter of no confidence in the PM, tweeted: 'I'm beginning to believe there's a 'Dead Cat Committee' in No.10 spewing out a regular drumbeat of sensationalist headlines. 'It's not about numbers, but outputs and productivity - the engine driving wider inspirational policy objectives that thematically sit together as a vision.' Unions are also furious over the plans, accusing ministers of plucking figures off the 'back of a fag packet'. Some are even threatening a national strike over the controversial plans. The Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) is to hold an emergency meeting of its executive committee next week to discuss its response. General secretary Mark Serwotka told PA that any job cuts would affect anyone relying on public services. He said: 'Our members will not be the scapegoats for a failing government. We have our conference in 10 days' time. Taking national strike action is very much on the table.' Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union for senior civil servants, told Times Radio: 'It's back of the fag packet stuff. What they've done is they've taken what is the average salary in the civil service and multiplied it by 91,000 and that's nonsensical because is that the people who are going to go? 'Where are the people are going to go? Are they more senior? Are they more junior? Which bits of the civil service are you going to cut? Does that apply equally to every department? So, again, these are just figures that are plucked out there for the headline.' TUC deputy general secretary Paul Nowak said: 'The government is yet again treating the civil service with contempt. Civil servants are key workers who keep this country running.' He said it was 'shameful' that the prime minister was 'throwing them under a bus' to distract from the government's 'failure to deal with the cost of living crisis'. Mike Clancy, general secretary of Prospect union, said the proposal represented an 'outrageous act of vandalism on our public services'.  Jacob Rees-Mogg was sent out today to defend Boris Johnson's plans to slash the number of civil servants by 91,000. The government efficiency minister said they wanted to bring the Whitehall headcount back to where it was in 2016.  Boris Johnson is understood to have told ministers on Thursday that the service should be slashed by a fifth. Rees-Mogg told Sky News: 'I know it sounds eye-catching but it's just getting back to the civil service we had in 2016. Since then, we've had to take on people for specific tasks. 'So dealing with the aftermath of Brexit and dealing with Covid, so there's been a reason for that increase, but we're now trying to get back to normal.' The Prime Minister told the Daily Mail: 'We have got to cut the cost of government to reduce the cost of living.' Ministers are expected to report back within a month with plans for achieving the cuts from their departments. A government spokeswoman said 'the public rightly expect their government to lead by example and run as efficiently as possible' as the nation faces rising costs.", "5d1b03846816177013730220e775ab47f63a47e1c306ac31104ee322": "Piers Morgan has blocked fellow broadcaster Simon McCoy on Twitter after the pair had a tense public exchange over viewing figures. The divisive former daytime star launched his new show on Talk TV last month, saying in the lead-up that he hoped to use his platform to 'cancel the cancel culture' which he claimed had 'infected societies around the world'. While reports have claimed that viewing figures for Piers' show have taken a nosedive since its debut - with other shows on the network reportedly recording no audience at all at some points - he seemed undeterred by this when he tweeted about his ratings on Wednesday. 'UPDATE: [we] beat Sky News and GB News in the UK ratings AGAIN last night,' he wrote. 'Still very early days, but the show is already gaining real traction around the world, making lots of news, and as I hoped, annoying all the right people.' However, Simon McCoy - who knows a thing or two about struggling start-up stations, having stepped down from GB News' on-air team last year - seemed unconvinced. 'Please show the figures,' he wrote back, alongside the hashtag #Facts. Piers responded within 10 minutes: 'Show me yours. Oh wait...' 'Retirement, Piers,' Simon replied. 'Try it.' 'What, and be as bitter as you?' Piers then wrote back. 'No thanks.' Following this, Simon posted a screengrab on his page, showing that Piers had blocked him on Twitter. Referring to Piers' repeated comments about not shutting down debates, Simon joked: 'Can't have been. He says he's open to debate...' Piers did actually speak about his penchant for blocking those he disagrees with on an edition of his show Piers Morgan Uncensored this week.  'Believe me,' he told his viewers. 'This may shock you, but people do say nasty things about me all the time on the internet. I don't cancel them. But I do sometimes block them or call them morons.

Depending on how far along you are, you might want to sort out your childcare needs. Sadly, we're not joking.  That's because waiting times are ridiculously long at the moment and some mums are sharing the advice they wish they knew before they had children.  One mum, author Libby Page, says her ultimate parenting advice would be to arrange childcare before the baby is here, so you have nothing to worry about when you want to go back to work. It does depend on the area you live in as some might be in high demand, while others may require a deposit before securing a place, but the general advice it to book it during pregnancy.  Don't forget that many parents register their baby on a waiting list as soon as they're expecting, which means places will go quickly.  Others replied to the thread sharing the difficulties they've had accessing childcare, even when they started extremely early. When should I start my childcare search? According to the Baby Centre, you should start looking during your pregnancy.  They say don't worry if you're unsure whether you'll return to work full-time or part-time, or even at all. Making enquiries as early as you can means you'll be armed with all the information you need to make a decision when the time comes. When do I need to make a decision about childcare? In areas where there's high demand, you may need to secure a childcare place for your baby before they're born or shortly after. However, in most cases you won't need to decide this early. It depends on the kind of childcare you want. According to Baby Centre, these can be   Day Centres which have a waiting list, so be prepared to put your child's name down up to six months before you need the place. You may need to pay a deposit or booking fee.   Childminders usually need to be booked at least a month in advance. However, it's worth making enquiries well before this as demand can vary.   A nanny may take time to find, so start your search at least several months before you need one.

The senior backbencher - who Johnson beat to the leadership in 2019 - warned the Tories they have 'a big mountain to climb' to win another term in office. It follows months of concerns over Johnson's leadership amid partygate allegations and heavy losses at the local elections.  Hunt told The Times Magazine it was not the 'right time' for a leadership change due to the war in Ukraine. However, he added: 'But I would be very open with you that I don't rule out a return in the future.' The former health secretary also told Times Radio that to win an election, the Conservative Party has to promise a 'well-funded NHS and the prospect of tax cuts'. 'If we make people choose between one or the other, we're not going to win the election,' he added.  There have been ongoing calls for the PM to resign over the saga from opposition MPs, as well as his own backbenchers, but he has repeatedly said he is determined to get on with the job.  Polling guru Lord Hayward has also said Johnson is on course to be toppled by his own MPs in the coming months. After the local elections, the Conservative peer said the 'mood has turned against the prime minister' and that he believed he will be dumped as Conservative leader.   Separately, HuffPost UK has heard that staff working for some Tory leadership hopefuls have been trying to 'tap-up' MPs for support for weeks.   One MP has also admitted they are a campaign manager-in-waiting for one hopeful.   However, any challenge depends on whether enough letters of no confidence have been submitted to chairman of the 1922 Committee Sir Graham Brady.  It comes after the latest tranche of Partygate fines issued by the Metropolitan Police left Boris Johnson and the Cabinet Secretary unscathed.  Yesterday the Met Police announced they had made around 50 further fixed penalty notice referrals as part of the investigation into possible lockdown-breaking parties in Downing Street and across Whitehall. It brought the number of fines to more than 100 - with Johnson, his wife Carrie and Chancellor Rishi Sunak hit with fixed penalty notices in April over a birthday party in June 2020. Johnson's official spokesman confirmed that neither the PM nor Cabinet Secretary Simon Case were among those fined in the latest batch.

The presenter has confessed there have been a number of occasions this week where he has been wished 'good luck' by other people believing he was competing.  Appearing on The One Show on Thursday evening, Rylan's co-host Scott Mills told Alex Jones and Ronan Keating: 'So I don't know if you saw Rylan's outfit on Tuesday and again this evening, you can see why some people in Turin may think that he is one of the contestants.' Rylan, whose Eurovision outfits were made by Great British Sewing Bee contestant Raph Dilhan, admitted he had been embracing the mix-up, joking: 'We've got to the point now that I just put on an Eastern European accent and I think they think I'm Romania.' Scott said it had actually happened moments before they came on air with Alex and Ronan via a link live from Turin in Italy, where the contest is being held.  'So it just happened again as we walked in, someone said 'Good luck tonight,' and he was like, 'thanks',' Scott said. Rylan then added in an accent: 'Thanks so much, so happy to be here.' Romania is being represented by WRS with Llamame during this year's competition - and it has to be said the singer's fashion isn't exactly dissimilar to Rylan's: Rylan has been involved in Eurovision since 2018, when he took over as one of the BBC's commentators during the semi-final stages of the competition. Speaking ahead of this year's contest, the TV presenter told The Sun it's become something of a 'tradition' for him to take the UK's representative out on the town in whatever country Eurovision is being held in - though this hasn't always gone down so well with organisers.  'It is tradition that I always take the British act out, normally on the Wednesday or the Thursday,' he explained. 'And then the head of delegation always has a go at me because I take them out.' This year's entrant is Sam Ryder, who is competing with his self-penned song Space Man, which is among the top of the bookies' favourites to win. The UK last won Eurovision 25 years ago with Katrina And The Waves' Love Shine A Light. This year's Eurovision final will air live on Saturday at 8pm on BBC One.

Just a day later, North Korea said a new fever had spread 'explosively' across the nation, infecting at least 350,000 people since April and causing at least six deaths, including one confirmed to be linked to the coronavirus. At least 18,000 people were diagnosed with the fever nationwide on Thursday alone, and more than 187,000 people were being isolated and treated.  'A fever whose cause couldn't be identified explosively spread nationwide from late April, and more than 350,000 people got fever in a short span of time,' North Korea's state-run KCNA said Friday. The agency added that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un expressed: 'It is the most important challenge and supreme tasks facing our party to reverse the immediate public health crisis situation at an early date, restore the stability of epidemic prevention and protect the health and wellbeing of our people.' The figures echo what many other countries experienced at the outset of the Covid pandemic in 2020. But for North Korea, which has effectively sequestered itself the past two years and maintained an iron grip on its people, the outbreak presents a stark public health challenge and raises deep concern that it could prompt a humanitarian crisis. State media said Thursday that authorities had found the first case of the highly transmissible omicron variant of the coronavirus, a rare admission from Pyongyang. All North Korean cities and counties were ordered into strict lockdown to prevent any spread. NK News reported some experts believe North Korea's large-scale military parade on April 25 could have been a superspreader event that triggered the current outbreak. Tens of thousands of maskless North Koreans participated in the event, which celebrated the 90th anniversary of the country's military. Kim himself wore a mask in public on Thursday, the first time he's believed to have done so. Yonhap News said the decision likely demonstrates the troubling situation North Korea is in with the latest outbreak. The New York Times noted that North Korea has not accepted any COVID-19 vaccine donations from other nations and has a woefully under-prepared public health system. Any strain on its health infrastructure would also be exacerbated by two years of border closures with China, its main trading partner, and fierce United Nations sanctions over its ballistic weapons programs. Joshua Pollack, the editor of the US-based Nonproliferation Review and a close follower of North Korea, said the country's years-long strategy to keep Covid out only imperiled it when the virus eventually arrived.  'North Korea's weak public health system has pushed them into a corner: to keep COVID out, they have sealed the borders right [up],' he wrote on Twitter. 'But this also keeps most food and medical imports out. The public is vulnerable.' South Korean officials have expressed hope that any request for aid from the North could help restart diplomatic talks that have languished for years. Seoul's Unification Ministry, which focuses on relations between the two nations, said the country would provide medical assistance and other help to the North if requested, The Associated Press reported. The US said Thursday it had no immediate plans to share vaccines with Pyongyang, with White House press secretary Jen Psaki accusing the Kim regime of focusing more on military power than medical supplies. 'We do continue to support international efforts aimed at the provision of critical humanitarian aid to the most vulnerable North Koreans, and this is, of course, a broader part of the DPRK continuing to exploit its own citizens by not accepting this type of aid,' Psaki said Thursday. 'It's not just vaccines. It's also a range of humanitarian assistance that could very much help the people and the country, and instead they divert resources to build their unlawful nuclear and ballistic missiles programs.'", "f8235481645b483e719817624299a0ec359692b2800fe6b3e81e5616": "It's 3pm, and your boyfriend/girlfriend/partner/crush hasn't messaged you back (if at all). You try not to hover over your chat, waiting for their 'last seen' to turn to 'online'.  In an age of digital intimacy, it's totally normal to fret over online connection, the abundance of it and its quality. Are we making an effort to converse enough? Are we updating one another about our days, our lives? Are we utilising the resources at our disposal - pictures, GIFS, emojis, videos and voice notes (love them or hate them?) - to show that we care? During a pandemic that took most of our interactions online, we've grown accustomed to relationship maintenance and courting turning virtual, too. So much so that someone has come up with a name for this attachment: 'Whatsapp Intimacy'. Coining the term for the New York Times's Modern Love column, writer Layla Kinjawi Faraj even suggests this connective need is a 'sixth love language' - for her and her Syrian family and the wide diaspora, a necessary bond between loved ones separated by many oceans and borders. While quality time, words of affirmation, physical touch, receiving gifts, and acts of service remain the five primary love languages named and identified by Gary Chapman in 1992, there are alternative ways of expressing your affection. WhatsApp (other messaging media are available!) has long bridged the distance between lovers, family members and friends unable to meet regularly. Even among those who share proximity, life online means constant communication and almost limitless opportunity to 'spend' time together, establishing the mundanity and excitement of day-to-day life that can bring us closer together. It's no wonder then that WhatsApp intimacy might be described as a love language - with many of us expecting a 'good morning' or 'goodnight, I love you' text daily without miss, not to mention little updates throughout the day.  So, why is this style of communication so addictive and where are its pitfalls? We spoke to Charisse Cook, a relationship psychotherapist, to find out how to navigate different love languages where one partner is online more than the other. She tells HuffPost UK: 'WhatsApp creates an immediacy with people that can mimic in-person intimacy. For many people it is reassuring to be reminded of someone's presence in their life throughout the day. Being in contact over WhatsApp allows for short, flirtatious or reassuring messages to be exchanged and that connection to be confirmed and reinforced.' But just as different people hold the other five love languages in greater or lesser regard, not everyone necessarily 'speaks' this one as fluently either. 'Some people may struggle with the expectation of this kind of contact during the day, and feel somewhat suffocated or under undue obligation,' she warns. So what can you do if this is you with a partner (or indeed a friend)? As with most matters of the heart, being open about your needs and limitations is a good rule of thumb. 'Agreeing ahead of time on the amount of messaging that both partners feel they can do wholeheartedly can help manage expectations and reduce upset or disappointment,' advises Cook. 'If one member of the relationship likes to message, they can understand that - for example - three messages from their partner shows a significant effort. 'Likewise, for the member of the relationship for whom constant contact is not necessary, they know they can respond three times and that will be meeting the needs of their partner, and will not be subject to criticism or complaints later on.' Don't want to shoot the (non) messenger? Best follow Cook's simple advice.", "4fe9f06bdb9afdcb4bcbbdecd9da5d0ebb7b1e5057e65079e6946732": "James Corden has heaped praise on Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, calling them 'brave' for stepping away from royal life.  The Gavin & Stacey star has become friends with the couple, attending their 2018 wedding and enjoying playdates for their children at the Sussexes' LA mansion.  James also interviewed Harry on his US chat show The Late Late Show, where the Duke went viral for rapping the Fresh Prince Of Bel Air theme last year. James says he is a 'huge fan of both' Meghan and Harry, and said it was 'hard to judge, or be judgemental' about them when he was asked about the couple in a new interview with The Sun. He said: 'People process things and deal with things in different ways and that's OK, and it's all right to think whatever you think about somebody. 'I don't know if it necessarily needs to be voiced the whole time but my experience of them has been nothing but positive. 'I have a huge amount of respect and admiration for Harry, and anyone who has been around him and spent time with him would feel exactly the same way.' The Duke and Duchess of Sussex revealed their unprecedented plan to step back from royal duties in January 2020 and are now living with son Archie and daughter Lilibet in Montecito, California. James continued: 'I think he is a devoted and loving husband and father and I think what they have done [in turning away from royal life] is incredibly brave and I'll always be in their corner.' The talk show host also added that he was also a 'big fan' of William and Kate, who Harry and Meghan are rumoured to have a rift with.  During Harry's interview with James last year, the host brought up his decision to walk away from the royal family, and the Duke was quick to clarify: 'It was never walking away. 'It was stepping back rather than stepping down,' Harry said. 'It was a really difficult environment as I think a lot of people saw. We all know what the British press can be like. And it was destroying my mental health. I was like, 'This is toxic.' So I did what any husband and what any father would do and was like, 'I need to get my family out of here.'  'But we never walked away,' he added. 'And as far as I'm concerned, and whatever decisions are made on that side, I will never walk away. I will always be contributing. But my life is public service. So wherever I am in the world it's going to be the same thing.'

The cabinet minister insisted it was a 'non-story' and that the public had now moved on from the scandal of lockdown-breaking parties in Number 10 and Whitehall. He also took aim at the BBC, who he said had 'loved' covering the story. The Metropolitan Police announced yesterday that the number of fixed penalty notices they had issued over the affair had doubled to more than 100, with the investigation continuing. Munchetty asked Rees-Mogg for his reaction to the news when he appeared on BBC Breakfast. The BBC presenter asked Rees-Mogg whether the news that more than 100 Downing Street staff have now been fined for breaking lockdown rules 'reflected well on this Conservative government'.  Rees-Mogg said: 'I'm afraid I think this is a non-story. The BBC has absolutely loved it, but what is important is we get on with the business of government.' Munchetty then interjected to ask: 'Why do you think this is a non-story? Have you not heard people upset, genuinely devastated, that people in Downing Street thought it was OK to break the rules that they set while other people didn't break the rules and missed out on meeting dying family members?' Rees-Mogg replied: 'I think people were upset. I think this was an important story in February when it first became known, and that there was great concern and there was a feeling of people who were bereaved particularly about it. 'I also think we need to look in the inquiry at the rules to see if they were proportionate.' The minister said the rules were 'too restrictive' because they prevented people from 'giving comfort to the dying'. Munchetty then asked: 'Can I just understand your interpretation of where we are with the rules and why you think this is a non-story? So, the fact that more than 100 fines have been issued in a non-story because the rules that were set in the first place were too rigorous?' The minister said: 'What I'm saying is the fines are a consequence of things we knew in February and it was a story in February and people now know about it and have made their judgment on it and there are other things going on that are more important.'", "2816635fd1dc7fdf0c9e960ecc8e21973023e10dcdde86c363f50793": "Jacob Rees-Mogg has defended Boris Johnson's plans to slash the number of civil servants by 91,000. The government efficiency minister said the government wanted to bring the Whitehall headcount back to where it was in 2016. He said the extra staff were brought in to help deal with the pandemic and the 'aftermath of Brexit'. Rees-Mogg told Sky News: 'I know it sounds eye-catching but it's just getting back to the civil service we had in 2016... since then we've had to take on people for specific tasks. 'So dealing with the aftermath of Brexit and dealing with Covid, so there's been a reason for that increase, but we're now trying to get back to normal.' The minister said there was currently too much 'duplication' in Whitehall, and insisted most of the jobs could be lost by not replacing the 38,000 civil servants who leave the government every year. He said: 'What I've seen within the Cabinet Office, which is where I work and bear in mind each secretary of state will be responsible for is or her own department, is that there's duplication within government, so you have a communications department and then you have within another department some people doing communications. 'So it's trying to ensure that you use the resources that you've got rather than duplicating it bit by bit.' Asked why the cuts were not being described as a return to austerity, he said: 'I don't think it is because what is being done is getting back to the efficiency levels we had in 2016.' Rees-Mogg has previously angered civil servants by leaving notes on the desks of those not in the office in an attempt to discourage working from home. They read: 'Sorry you were out when I visited. I look forward to seeing you in the office very soon. Wish every good wish.' The drive has been branded 'vindictive' by Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA representing senior civil servants, who said ministers were out of step with practice in the private sector.", "e294433e59259263d0fef00ec867d9ce22dea05e5ad760af185cdd92": "Applications have now closed for the role of Met Police commissioner, and whoever takes the role will need to work hard to win back the trust women lost during Cressida Dick's reign.  The outgoing commissioner acknowledged this, prior to her departure saying: 'We know a precious bond has been broken and I am committed to rebuilding the trust and confidence of all Londoners.' Winning back this trust won't be easy, but it is vital. Victims of crime need to have absolute trust and faith in those to whom they will tell their story. Already fewer than one in six women report rape, as they fear the police won't do anything about it.  But the lack of trust goes much deeper than a fear that interaction with police will result in lack of action: The horrific case of Sarah Everard, raped and murdered by serving Met police officer Wayne Couzens, has left women afraid.  While it has always been the approach of police forces to label criminality by police officers as the work of 'bad apples', the litany of ignored incidents by a man nicknamed 'the rapist' by colleagues speaks of an organisation with little regard for women's safety.  Couzens had joined the Met from the Civil Nuclear Constabulary before being assigned to the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection (PaDP) branch, but had not undergone enhanced vetting nor gone through the mandatory two-year probation period with the Met before joining the PaDP.  There were at least three allegations of indecent exposure filed against him. Radio presenter Emma B also came forward to say that she had attempted to report Couzens in 2008, after he flashed her in an alley in Greenwich, but that the Police had laughed at her.  We now need to know that police vetting will be stepped up and that behaviour such as that displayed by Couzens will not be tolerated. Indeed, it would not be in most work places. Even within Sarah's case there are more examples of deeply disturbing police behaviour.  An officer who had been a part of the search was suspended from duties after sharing an inappropriate graphic on social media, five officers were placed under investigation for sharing grossly offensive material with Couzens before he killed Sarah and several officers gave character references supportive of Couzens during his sentencing hearing.  Several female officers told the press that they did not feel as if they could report concerning behaviour by male colleagues. So another question that needs answering from all applicants for the commissioner job is how they will root out this behaviour, rid the Met of this hugely offensive culture and make sure anyone reporting concerning actions - including other police staff -- is protected.  If female police officers feel unsafe making reports to colleagues, it is hard to see how other women could possibly feel able to. The sharing of offensive material appears epidemic by Met police officers. Last December two Met police constables who took photos of the bodies of murdered sisters of Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry and shared the images on WhatsApp groups were jailed for 33 months.  Meanwhile, officers at Charing Cross police station were found to have joked about rape and exchanged offensive social media messages.  In April, responding to the IOCP investigation into the Charing Cross police station, the police said they would have a zero-tolerance approach to misogyny. Yet, of the 14 officers investigated, nine are still serving, while another is working as a contractor in a staff role. I am not sure this sounds like 'zero tolerance'. Talk about organisational cultural change is easy - finding ways and implementing them is much harder. But women and girls simply cannot be safe whilst misogyny is allowed to be part of the Met's culture.  Like women across the capital, I look forward to hearing the new commissioner's plans for fundamental change.

Appearing on BBC's Question Time, the four-time world champion said the global climate crisis has made him question whether continuing in the sport is the right thing to do. When asked by presenter Fiona Bruce whether being a star in a 'gas guzzling' sport and campaigning for reducing carbon emissions made him a hypocrite, he replied: 'It does.'  Vettel wore a T-shirt ahead of last weekend's inaugural Miami Grand Prix which read: 'Miami 2060. First Grand Prix under water. Act now or swim later.' But when it was put to the German, who won four consecutive titles with Red Bull between 2010 and 2013, that he competes in one of the most gas-guzzling sports in the world and if that makes him a hypocrite, he replied: 'It does, it does and you [the audience] are right when you laugh because there are questions I ask myself every day.

This realisation often comes around the time you notice your battery is running low. And sometimes, buying a new charger isn't an option. Having your phone battery die is hardly the end of the world, but it can certainly pose challenges if you need to navigate an unfamiliar place or keep in contact with people. Fortunately, there are ways to extend your battery life and buy yourself some time before you can reach a charger. Below, tech experts share their tips. Turn on low power mode 'Most phones nowadays have a battery-saving feature, and iPhones specifically have a feature called 'low power mode,'' says technology reviewer and journalist Elly Bailey, aka Elly Awesome. 'This reduces or alters many features to save battery life, such as your phone's display brightness, automatic downloads, background app refresh and more. So, if you can toggle this on, it's a no-brainer. While iPhones automatically ask users if they'd like to turn on low power mode once the battery falls below a 20% charge, turning it on even sooner can help save more power. You can find the 'low power mode' option under the Battery tab in Settings on iPhones and the analogous 'battery saving mode' feature in the same place on Android phones. Disable location services 'Some apps keep close track [of] your location, even when you're not using them,' notes Jessica Naziri, founder of the technology and lifestyle blog TechSesh. 'They do this through a process called Location Services, and although it's meant to be unobtrusive, it can take up precious amounts of battery power.' Naziri advised going into your settings and turning off location tracking for all your apps at once, or going through them one by one and making choices. Turning off location services means those apps will use less power. Bailey made a similar recommendation: 'If you're really desperate to keep that last bit of charge, I would suggest going into your location services and turning it off - if this isn't a safety issue for you.' Reduce screen brightness 'Your phone's display is one of its most power-hungry components, so if you've got the brightness slider pegged at maximum, it's going to drain your battery in no time,' says technology writer and video creator Michael Fisher, aka MrMobile. 'If you're not outdoors in broad daylight, bumping that brightness down a little - or a lot - is a great way to conserve battery power.' Naziri notes to 'make sure the 'auto-brightness' is turned on, so the screen will automatically dim if you're in a dark setting.' Go into dark mode Reducing screen brightness isn't the only display adjustment you can make to help extend your battery life. 'If your phone has an OLED screen (most modern high-end phones do), switching your software to dark mode can save battery, since dark pixels on an OLED panel take no power to illuminate,' Fisher says. 'They're just off.' Dark mode is available under Display & Brightness in iPhone settings and under Display in Android settings. Turn off Wi-Fi Many features that make smartphones such a great convenience - like Wi-Fi access - naturally use a good bit of battery power. So if your goal is to prevent reaching 0% before you can get to a phone charger, disable those functions. 'Turn off extra features like Bluetooth or Wi-Fi if you're not using them,' Bailey advises.  Close battery-draining apps If you want to preserve battery, pay attention to the apps you have open on your phone and what they're doing. 'Those apps that suck up our time are also the biggest battery-drainers,' Naziri notes. 'I'm talking about social media apps including Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Snapchat, YouTube and WhatsApp. And if you're low on juice, this is your reminder that FaceTime and playing games can kill the battery much faster than you can reach a charger.' Watching videos and playing games are taxing on batteries, so keep this in mind if you're trying to preserve power. Turn off push notifications for apps and close them strategically. 'Make sure background apps aren't performing power-intensive tasks - eg. Spotify downloading a new playlist, or Google Photos performing a backup,' Fisher advises. 'Note that this doesn't mean you should go on a swiping spree, closing out all your apps. That might feel good, but it causes more harm than good by interfering with your phone's automatic background management. The preferred approach here is a precision strike, not carpet bombing.' Turn on airplane mode 'If you're using your phone for offline features, or otherwise don't need constant connectivity before you can find a charger, toggle airplane mode,' Fisher suggests. 'This disables all the wireless radios, which saves a fair amount of power.' Turning on airplane mode preserves power and serves as a good reminder to stay off your phone until you can plug it into a charger.  'Personally, when I put my phone on airplane mode, I only remove it when I need to do an urgent or necessary action,' says Marie-Philippe Gill, creator of Girl Knows Tech. Don't skip app updates In addition to the above steps you can take in the moment to preserve battery, there are more general ways to promote longer battery life.  'Don't skip app updates,' Naziri advises. 'If you've been putting updates off, this is your sign - improving efficiency and battery management along the way. In fact, you should probably just turn on auto-update if you can.'  Be mindful about charging It's also important to keep overall battery health in mind when you are able to charge your phone.  'Fast charging is convenient, but it reduces the overall longevity of your battery,' Fisher notes. 'If your phone has a 'smart charging' or 'healthy charging' mode and you're not in a rush (say, if you're sleeping and charging overnight), use it. It will charge the battery slowly and prolong its life.' He also advised carrying an external battery pack, or asking a friend if you can use their phone to charge yours through the 'power share' or 'reverse wireless charging' features, if that's an option.  'I usually try to follow Apple's guidelines on battery health,' Gill says. 'For example, I try to minimise the amount of battery cycles that my devices go through.' Naziri says she generally avoids charging her phone to a full 100% when possible. 'A lithium-ion battery doesn't like to be fully charged or warm,' she explains. 'The lithium-ion batteries in our phones last longest when we keep them charged between 30% and 80% throughout the day - not just topped up to 100%, then down to zero. Also, wireless charging is so convenient, but batteries prefer a slow and steady input. Consider using a standard charger when you can.'", "e34120f89ca55dd714e68df3d9b7b0ce0f3937d410ef8f4a38724520": "We hope you love the products we recommend!

Now the two semi-finals are behind us, we're ready for the main event, with everything from Euro-bangers and heartbreaking ballads to dancing wolves and some throwback noughties rock to keep us entertained on Saturday night. Just two questions remain now. Who are the frontrunners? And are they any good? Well, wonder no longer, as we round up our ones to watch at this year's Eurovision, our verdicts on their competing songs and even their winning odds (via Betfair)... Kalush Orchestra - Stefania Representing: Ukraine Odds: 8/15 Our verdict: For obvious reasons, Ukraine is the odds-on favourite to be crowned this year's Eurovision winners, and between traditional imagery of Ukrainian beauty showcased on stage mixed with the band's passionate performance, this one is sure to pack an emotional punch on the Turin stage. It's worth noting, though, that even outside of the context of the tragedies still ongoing in Ukraine, the Kalush Orchestra's offering would still be one of the strongest of the year (hardly surprising, given Ukraine always deliver something remarkable at Eurovision, one way or another). Like Go_A last year, the group have taken traditional elements of Ukrainian music and put a contemporary twist on them by including rap verses and electronic instruments, while including a message of maternal love that transcends language barriers. And while it's pretty much a dead cert that the public will be showing their support for Ukraine at Eurovision with their votes - the question remains whether the juries will be doing the same. Mahmood & Blanco - Brividi Representing: Italy Odds: 4/1 Our verdict: In a year that's actually pretty heavy on ballads, this passionate tune between returning star Mahmood (who came in second place with Soldi back in 2019) and Italian musician Blanco (primarily known as a rapper in his home country, interestingly enough) stands out for the sheer drama that it delivers on. Sung entirely in Italian, the two musicians swap lines about the difficulties of a turbulent romance over the course of the lush and orchestral track, and their voices sound really beautiful together. Brividi has already had huge success in Italy, and impressively landed among the five most-played songs on Spotify worldwide when it was first released, so it's undoubtedly one to keep an eye out for. If they do win, Italy will become the first country to triumph at Eurovision two years in a row since Ireland back in the early 90s (when they pulled off the still-amazing triple win). Sam Ryder - Space Man Representing: UK Odds: 7/1 Our verdict: After last year's result, we didn't think we'd be seeing the UK so far up the list of potential winners any time soon - but that's the power of a good song (not to mention the power of a UK representative who understands Eurovision as much as Sam Ryder seems to). This year a number of the favourites have leaned into traditional elements from the country they're representing, which is kind of what Sam has done with his lyrical and musical nods to Queen, David Bowie and Elton John - who he told HuffPost UK were his 'holy trinity' of British musicians - within Space Man. Unlike some of his predecessors, Sam has also put in the leg-work when it comes to promoting his track. As he put it: 'We wanted to make sure that no matter what happens at the end of this, we can look back and say 'we didn't leave any stone unturned'. We went everywhere, we sang on street corners, we did TV promo in countries where the UK entrant has never gone before. 'We paid respect to the actual institution of Eurovision, because the fans deserve that. And I think that's also your responsibility.' And while we can't say we're 100% convinced Space Man is a winning track, we're still backing Sam all the way, and can't wait to see if his hard work pays off on the night. Cornelia Jakobs - Hold Me Closer Representing: Sweden Odds: 9/1 Our verdict: We're going to be completely candid and say we've been obsessed with Hold Me Closer since Cornelia's first performance at Melodifestivalen way back in February, and we're over the moon that the whole world is going to get a chance to fall in love with this song. Sweden has become known for sending undeniable bangers like Benjamin Ingrosso's Dance You Off, Mans Zelmerlow's Heroes and, of course, the iconic Euphoria by Loreen. It's interesting, then, that this year's offering is a ballad, particularly one as straight-up heartbreaking as Hold Me Closer, on which a downcast Cornelia sings about an inevitable break-up. There's still enough here to keep your average pop fan interested, though, including the slow build-up of Cornelia's passionate delivery and the mix of organic instruments and electronics on the production - even if it doesn't have you up dancing around the sofa. One way it does hark back to some of Sweden's greatest Eurovision stars, though, is the simplicity of both the track and its staging, which we can only imagine will help the message of the song really shine through on the Turin stage. Amanda Tenfjord - Die Together Representing: Greece Odds: 20/1 Our verdict: Anyone who thinks Eurovision is about cramming as many gimmicks and elaborate costumes into a three-minute space as possible needs to take a listen to what Greece is serving up this year. Mixing the sounds of Lorde, Billie Eilish and Imogen Heap with a touch of Olivia Rodrigo, Amanda Tenfjord's emotional tune Die Together is almost completely acapella for a full minute, with the sparse production letting her heartbreaking lyrics really resonate, and the build-up that comes later feel all the more satisfying. Quite how this will translate to the big Eurovision stage remains to be seen, but if she can pull it off (and she gets a decent spot on the running order, so she doesn't blend too much into the other ballads on the night), Amanda could definitely be onto a winner. Chanel - Slo Mo Representing: Spain Odds: 18/1 Our verdict: If you're tuning in to Eurovision for bangers and/or a full visual production, then trust us when we say that this is what you've been waiting for. Chanel is serving us a fully bilingual bop here, complete with full choreography and that rare thing of beauty that is a Eurovision dance break just for good measure. In a year that's relatively low on upbeat numbers, SloMo may well be just what people need as a palate cleanser after a string of ballads and midtempo tunes, and we definitely think it's going to make people sit up and pay attention. There are obvious comparisons to be made to Eleni Foureira's Fuego here, but this is far from a retread of what we've already seen at the competition. Between Spain, Italy and the UK, the big five are really bringing it this year, and we defy anyone not to be dancing along with Chanel by the finish (even if our armchair moves are somewhat less impressive than hers). Subwoolfer - Give That Wolf A Banana  Representing: Norway Odds: 50/1 Our verdict: Well, there always has to be some element of novelty at Eurovision, doesn't there? Norway's entry is definitely one of the year's most controversial, thanks in no small part to its borderline-nonsensical lyrics, including lines like 'not sure you have a name, so I will call you Keith', 'if you don't like the name Keith I'ma call you Jim' and the earworm chorus: 'Before that wolf eats my grandma give that wolf a banana'. Alrighty then. Completing the ridiculousness are Subwoolfer's bright yellow wolf costumes and their accompanying dance routine which, in what we're sure is no accident, is totally TikTok-ready. It might all seem like a bit of silly fun, but Subwoolfer are genuine contenders - and they've got the Spotify streams to prove it, so we definitely wouldn't count them out just yet. Oh, and for any millennial pop fans out there, that's Ben Adams (the one with the curtains from 90s boyband A1) underneath one of those masks. Konstrakta - In Corpore Sano Representing: Serbia Odds: 80/1 Our verdict: Another of the year's more unusual offerings is this folksy number from Serbian singer-songwriter Konstrakta. At first glance, there's not a great deal to this song or its performance, aside from Konstrakta giving her hands a scrub while surrounded by some fairly intimidating backing singers. It's only when you give the lyrics a run through Google translate you realise there's a bit more going on than you might realise. 'What's the secret to Meghan Markle's healthy hair?' Konstrakta sings at the beginning of the song, before referencing everything from 'an enlarged spleen', the 'autonomic nervous system' and walking the dog on a summer's day, which suffice to say has left a lot of room for interpretation, with fans online offering their own theories about exactly what the lyrics might mean. In fact, the song seems to deal with the importance placed on good physical health and traditional beauty at the expense of mental health, particularly after the Covid-19 pandemic. The Rasmus - Jezebel Representing: Finland Odds: 100/1 Our verdict: Rock has always had its place on the Eurovision stage, whether that's the heavy metal stylings of Lordi's Hard Rock Hallelujah or the more contemporary stylings of Maneskin. This year, The Rasmus are taking up the rock mantle on behalf of Finland, with their tune Jezebel. It's a total throwback to the emo era of the 2000s, and also happens to be catchy as hell. We'll admit we don't quite see it among the big hitters like Italy, Ukraine and Sweden - but it's bound to score a few votes from anyone who spent their teenage years rocking out in their bedroom to In The Shadows. The Eurovision Song Contest final airs live on Saturday night at 8pm on BBC One.", "b31293dbe2cb490fdc0de1eeaa9b8016b2919e68801df49634970601": "The mood seems to be shifting in the UK with regards to Eurovision this year, and it's largely thanks to one man: Sam Ryder. After - let's be honest - a shaky few years for us at the contest, the Essex-born singer-songwriter seems to have charmed Eurovision fans both around Europe and at home, which is no mean feat when you consider many Brits' attitudes towards the contest of late. This must be music to Sam's ears, who has said changing people's feeling towards Eurovision in the UK is one of his main aims by taking part. 'It's not just about the three minutes on stage,' Sam tells HuffPost UK from Turin during some rare down-time in the lead-up to this year's final. 'That's the grand finale at the end of everything. 'But the build-up is so long, so it's more about what you do with that time, how you carry yourself and what your attitude is publicly. What are you standing for, what is your message that you're trying to put out there? Regardless of winning, that's the real stuff. That's the real task when you sign up to do it. 'I think that's where your eyes have got to be. Not, 'I hope I don't get nil points' or 'I hope I come at a certain place on the leaderboard', it's what you choose to do in the time leading up to it that's going to change those attitudes. 'If we can do well in that regard, and change a certain attitude and try and tear some of that self-perpetuating negativity down, even just a little bit, surely that is the biggest win? That's even more of a win than winning the contest.' Eager as he is to be representing the UK, Sam freely admits he had his own reservations about getting involved, after two back-to-back last place finishes for us - including last year's infamous nil points moment. He recalls: 'My initial reaction was that of a Eurovision fan. Like, 'this is wicked, what an opportunity, I'd love to do this'. And then a split second later, that's when the other voices come in, don't they? Voices that are like, 'yeah but what if you get nil points' or 'this might ruin your career' or 'you'll never work again!'. That sort of stuff.' Still, he insists, those feelings were short-lived. 'It's important to remember that those thoughts are completely fabricated by yourself,' Sam continues. 'No one else is saying those things, you are making them. You are bringing them to life in your mind. 'In regards to past experiences and focussing on that negativity, it's so much better to look forward, and I firmly believe that a positive mindset can completely shift your experience of a situation that you're in. My enthusiasm is greater than my fear of that scoreboard.' And what of those cynics who argued that, after last year's result, the UK should reconsider even taking part in Eurovision? He says: 'If people have a tired view of Eurovision, I would urge them not to put so much weight in your joy coming from where the UK or your country comes on the scoreboard. 'Put your attention and your focus into the time you spend with your family and loved ones watching this bonkersness unfold on TV in front of you, and having an absolute blast.' 'And if the scoring bothers you, turn it off and do the washing up afterwards,' he adds with a laugh. 'That's not what it's all about. I bet everyone else goes out to restaurants or the cinema or the pub, and they don't have to wait for a scoreboard before they leave and go home. Life isn't about that. You can enjoy something despite that.' Here's what else Sam had to say as we asked him about all things Eurovision... Were you always a fan of Eurovision, and has your opinion of it changed over time? I've been a fan since I was a kid, hanging out with my mum and dad, my sisters and my grandad, sitting in my lounge and watching it every year. I've got such memories of joy, and in a way, they're some of the warmest memories I have, actually. All getting together and doing stuff like that, they're rare opportunities where you get to do that. And you carry that tradition on with your friends as you get older. The food gets worse, but the company is always good. What's your earliest memory of watching Eurovision at home? It's not necessarily the songs that I remember, it's more the feeling of sitting with my family. There was always music in our house, my parents are massive music lovers, so of course, Eurovision would be on the telly every year. I have memories of togetherness and family time - and real joy.  What are your three all-time favourite Eurovision songs? My favourite Eurovision moment was Lordi's Hard Rock Hallelujah. I was just starting to learn the guitar around that time. And seeing them on stage, in their prosthetics and big platform shoes, bat wings and battleaxes, what's not to like about that? I've got to shout out Lucie Jones and Never Give Up On You, because she's one of the best vocalists in the UK. Her technique and her pitch are incredible, and she's a lovely human being. Also, Waterloo by ABBA, of course. Because it's a belter.  Obviously besides yourself, who are you rooting for at Eurovision this year? Everyone has taken that leap of bravery to play in front of 200 million people, and so everyone deserves respect, so it would feel a bit like bad manners to pick someone. Everyone is putting themselves on the line in some way, or battling some kind of nerves to get on that stage. Everyone has my admiration in that regard, and everyone is so lovely as well. Why is Eurovision still so important? I think it reminds us how important expression is, and the freedom to express yourself. How many people do you think feel afraid to express themselves freely? And Eurovision... it's amazing, people just feel good in their own skin, and that's inspiring. Or not even your own skin, it might be prosthetics, with regard to Lordi. But I think it's so cool. It's so inclusive, I don't think there's a more accepting fanbase in the world than Eurovision, and I am so humbled and grateful to just be a little part of that story. I'll never forget it.

The co-host of the You, Me and the Big C podcast, who was diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2016, on Monday revealed she is receiving end-of-life care. The mother-of-two said she was sharing the message she 'never wanted to write'. 'We have tried everything, but my body simply isn't playing ball,' she wrote on Instagram and Twitter. 'My active care has stopped and I am now moved to hospice at home care, with my incredible family all around me and the focus is on making sure I'm not in pain and spending time with them.' The podcast, which James co-founded with Lauren Mahon and the late Rachael Bland, has touched millions of lives worldwide. But James wanted to drive this last fundraising push to give 'one final F you to cancer', and has raised more than PS3m for Cancer Research UK. In a statement, Downing Street said the Queen was 'pleased to approve the honour of damehood' be conferred upon James. Prime minister Boris Johnson praised her for her work helping others with cancer. He said: 'If ever an honour was richly deserved, this is it. Deborah has been an inspiration and her honesty, warmth and courage has been a source of strength to so many people. 'Through her tireless campaigning and by so openly sharing her experience she has not only helped in our fight against this terrible disease, she has ensured countless others with the Big C have not felt alone. 'I hope this recognition from Her Majesty - backed I'm sure by the whole country - will provide some comfort to Deborah and her family at this difficult time. My thoughts are with them and Deborah should know she has the country's love and gratitude.' Speaking about the damehood, James told The Sun: 'I don't know what to say. I'm blown away and feel incredibly honoured. 'I don't feel like I deserve this. I can't tell you what this means to my family, it's so much to take in.' She told the newspaper her fund has 'surpassed all expectations', adding: 'I'd love to get it to PS5 million by the end of the weekend.' This is a breaking news story and will be updated.

But just how realistic are these concerns? Here's everything you need to know. What nuclear weapons does Russia have? Russia has the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons in the world, although it has cut down on its supplies since the Cold War. The Nuclear Threat Initiative claims that, as of 2022, the country has approximately 6,257 warheads. It also has both smaller tactical weapons along with larger strategic missiles. Tactical nuclear weapons vary in size and strength, but - in the very unlikely event Russia does start to use its nuclear supply - Moscow will probably deploy these first. They can be one kiloton (the equivalent to 1,000 tonnes of explosive substance) while the larger ones can go up to 100 kilotons. Russia's largest strategic weapons are believed to be at least 800 kilotons. For context, the atomic bomb that killed around 146,000 people in Japan during Second World War was 15 kilotons. But, it's important to note that the impact from each of these weapons would depend on the size of the nuke, how far above the ground it detonates and the surrounding area. Aside from Russia, the US, the UK, China, France, Pakistan, India, Israel and North Korea are all known to have nuclear weapons. Russia - along with the US, UK, China and France - also signed the 1968 Treaty of Non-Proliferation promising to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. What has Putin said about the weapons? Putin has been holding his nuclear arsenal over the West ever since he launched his attack on Ukraine, and has claimed that Russia is 'one of the most potent nuclear powers and also has a certain edge in a range of state-of-the-art weapons'. The country's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov then warned in April that the risk of nuclear war was 'considerable' because the West continues to supply Ukraine with weapons, even though the West has done this since the invasion began. Russia has also repeatedly promised that its nuclear weapons will be used 'exclusively as a means of deterrence', although it's not entirely unclear what would qualify as a provocation to Moscow. Why would Putin deploy them now? The invasion has not gone to plan Russia's invasion of Ukraine has definitely not gone as smoothly as the Kremlin originally planned. The Russian forces' attack has been barbaric and caused millions of Ukrainians to flee. But, with skyrocketing losses and no real victory in any part of Ukraine,  the strength of the nation's resistance continues to take Russia by surprise. The West is teaming up Putin's invasion was at least partially motivated by his fears that the West, particularly Nato, was uniting against him. Since his invasion, Ukraine has decided to step back from the defence organisation. However, Finland - which also shares a border with Russia - has announced it plans to join Nato as soon as possible.  Sweden is considering it as well, despite being neutral historically.  The West appears to be doing the exact opposite of what Putin supposedly wanted and is coming together.  The UK also went further than any Western country and pledged to send troops to Sweden if it comes under attack from Russia on Wednesday. The deputy chairman of the security council, Dmitry Medvedev, said on Thursday that as Nato is still sending weapons to Ukraine, it 'increases the likelihood of a direct and open conflict between Nato and Russia'. Such a conflict, he claimed, could turn into a 'full-blown nuclear war'. Russia's isolation The sanctions in the West are starting to have a real impact on Russia, as prices rise and goods are harder to buy. On top of that, the West is gradually severing its ties with the country's oil and gas industries. Even Germany revealed on Thursday that it believes it can cope with a boycott of Russian gas by this winter, despite being previously reliant on the export. But do people think Putin will actually use them? Director of national intelligence in the US, Avril Haines, warned on Tuesday that defeat in Ukraine could lead to an escalation of tensions. While she clarified that the Russian president is not expected to use a nuclear weapon unless he saw an existential threat to Russia or regime, there is a chance that losing in Ukraine could fall into such a category. Haines said: 'The current trend increases the likelihood that President Putin will turn to more drastic means, including imposing martial law, reorienting industrial production, or potentially escalatory military actions to free up the resources needed to achieve his objectives as the conflict drags on, or if he perceives Russia is losing in Ukraine.' However she added that she expects there to be some form of 'signalling beyond what he's done thus far before' if he were seriously considering it. Former US under-secretary of defence for policy, Walter Slocombe, also told the US think tank Atlantic Council: 'There is some non-zero (perhaps a worryingly high 1 or 2%) risk he will carry out his threats.' Not everyone is as concerned though. When Russia moved to put its nuclear deterrent on high alert, defence secretary Ben Wallace dismissed it. He said the move was an attempt to distract 'the world and the public from what he's actually doing in Ukraine'. Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said at the end of April: 'This only means Moscow sense losing hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraine.' According to nuclear expert James Acton, from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in the US, Putin would use the weapons only to 'terrify everyone and get his way'. Ukraine is also very close to Russia, geographically, and Putin claims the two are one country, meaning the use of a nuke is a high risk move for the Kremlin. Although the Russian leader has crossed lines before (see: invading Ukraine) others such as Kings College London's nuclear expert Dr Heather Williams think that Kremlin's dependence on China would deter such a drastic move. Speaking to the BBC, she said: 'China has a 'no first use' nuclear doctrine. So if Putin did use them, it would be incredibly difficult for China to stand by him. If he used them, he would probably lose China.' What would happen if Russia did use nuclear weapons? In the unlikely event Putin were to use his nuclear power, experts believe he would deploy the weapons in Ukraine and they would be used against the military rather than civilian targets. Former senior staff member for the National Security Council in the US, Jan Lodal, told the Atlantic Council: 'The sequence would look like this: Putin would first create a 'provocation', then hit a high-value target such as Kyiv in hopes of getting Ukraine to accept 'peace at any cost'. 'However, he would also seek to avoid any potential spillover, such as radiation, into any NATO state.' However, it's not clear how the West would respond to a nuclear attack. The UK and its allies would probably want to avoid escalating the situation, but how authority in the face of Putin's dangerous actions at the same time. So far, US intelligence suggests there has been no significant change in Russia's storage of weapons, so they are not deployed and ready to fire. As nuclear expert James Acton told the BBC: 'Once you have crossed the nuclear threshold, there is no obvious stopping point. 'I don't think anyone can have any confidence of what that world would look like.'

The foreign secretary told European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic that the bloc needed to budge during a 'tetchy' phone call this morning. She said a failure to do so would leave the UK with 'no choice' but to tear up the agreement on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. But in response, Sefcovic said the EU had moved as far as it could and would be making no further concessions. He said: 'The EU cannot solve all the problems created by Brexit and the type of Brexit that the UK chose. 'That is the reason why the EU's position has been consistent: we will not renegotiate the protocol, and the EU is united in this position. 'Unilateral action, effectively disapplying the protocol, is not a solution for the way forward.' He said the commission 'stands ready' to carry on working for a joint solution to the frictions being caused by the accord, and urged the UK 'to do the same'. The UK insists the Protocol, which created a customs border in the Irish Sea, must be radically redrawn in order to protect the Good Friday Agreement and restore power-sharing government at Stormont. If no agreement is reached, legislation over-riding parts of the Protocol is set to be introduced by ministers next week - a move which could trigger a trade war between the UK and EU. In a statement issued after the call between Truss and Sefcovic, a Foreign Office spokesperson said: 'The Foreign Secretary outlined that the UK's overriding priority is to protect peace and stability in Northern Ireland and said that the Northern Ireland Protocol had become the greatest obstacle to forming a Northern Ireland Executive. 'She also noted that the current situation was causing unacceptable disruption to trade and had created a two-tier system where people in Northern Ireland weren't being treated the same as everyone else in the UK. 'She reminded Vice President Sefcovic of the importance of defending the Belfast [Good Friday] Agreement, and said that the commission bore a responsibility to show more pragmatism and ensure the protocol delivered on its original objectives.'", "5e0f6071b5a83f23287a9085f25a2feaf66c8c23d2dffd10e23c5282": "Boris Johnson has been accused of a 'cover up', after the government withheld detailed security advice related to the awarding of a peerage to the Russian-born businessman Evgeny Lebedev. Earlier this year, MPs voted to force ministers to release documents about the prime minister's involvement in the appointment. But in response, the government has simply released the blank form Lord Lebedev was required to fill in by the House of Lords Appointments Commission. It has also published the public citation announcing his appointment, a list of the other peerages awarded at the same time, and a letter congratulating him on the news. Angela Rayner, Labour's deputy leader, said: 'This looks like a cover up and smells like a cover up because it is a cover up.' It followed questions as to whether the PM asked anyone in the security services to reconsider or withdraw their assessment of Lord Lebedev ahead of his appointment in November 2020. Lord Lebedev is the owner of the London Evening Standard and a shareholder in The Independent. His father, the oligarch Alexander Lebedev, was a former KGB agent. In a statement, Cabinet Office minister Michael Ellis said the government was 'committed to openness and transparency'. But he said it had to take into account security concerns as well as the need to maintain the 'integrity' of the honours system. 'It is also the case that when considering requests for information from parliament, the government has a responsibility to consider whether it is in the public interest to place information into the public domain,' he said. 'As laid out in today's House of Commons paper, the disclosure of these documents reflects the need to protect national security, to maintain integrity in the system for the awarding of honours and dignities by the Crown, the vetting of nominees for probity and the data protection rights of individuals.' Ellis added: 'Lord Lebedev is a man of good standing. No complaint has been made about his personal conduct. He has been vocal in his criticism of the Putin regime.' Rayner said: 'If the prime minister is claiming he was not involved in forcing through the award of a peerage to an individual of concern to our intelligence services, he should come clean and publish the documents as Parliament instructed. 'The public have a right to know the truth about Boris Johnson's interference in the appointment of his friend Lord Lebedev, the son and business partner of an ex-KGB agent, to a seat in the heart of our parliament. It is time to get to the bottom of this whole murky business.'", "d2aebfa225c57c59fbc902888f13180f345caf65e921972706641869": "Hilary Duff's Women's Health cover shoot has caused quite the stir. The star and mother of three, who found fame as a teenager in the Disney Channel's Lizzy McGuire, is posing nude.  'Who cares?' we hear you say. Well, a lot of people, actually.  Though some are championing the beauty of her photos, others are questioning if it was really necessary for her to get naked.  The pictures have clearly caused a division, but do we always need to have an opinion on what women do with their bodies? Whenever a woman chooses to get naked, there's always a discussion around it. Of course no celebrity is exempt from critique, but why do we always feel the need to comment on their choices? Women have the freedom to be able to do what they want with their bodies, when they want.  The commentary hasn't even stopped with the nudity thing, with people bringing Duff's age into the conversation, even when it sounds like a compliment. Call it Lizzie McGuire fans who can't believe it's been almost two decades since their favourite show wrapped, but suggesting Duff has 'aged like fine wine'? (FYI, she's only 34). Readers are also chewing over the contents of the interview inside the cover. The article focuses on Duff growing to accept her body and rejecting 'Hollywood's standards'. 'I'm proud of my body. I'm proud that it's produced three children for me,' she says. 'I've gotten to a place of being peaceful with the changes my body has gone through. I also want people to know a makeup artist was there putting glow all over my body and someone put me in the most flattering position.' This is all good news - we're happy for Duff, who's spoken about struggling with an eating disorder when she was 17. And we also applaud her honesty about the way these cover shoots work.

Andrew Bowie, a former Conservative Party vice-chairman, told HuffPost UK the move would lead to job losses in the North Sea. The West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine MP said it was the 'consensus view' among all of his Scottish colleagues that a windfall tax was a bad idea. His comments came as it was reported that the chancellor had ordered Treasury officials to assess the impact of a windfall tax, amid growing speculation the government will bring one in. The government has repeatedly rejected calls from Labour and the Lib Dems for a one-off levy on the bumper profits being enjoyed by energy firms due to the global spike in oil and gas prices. However, Sunak today left the door open to bringing in a windfall tax unless the companies use their extra cash to increase investment in things like green energy. 'These companies are making a significant amount of profit at the moment because of these very elevated prices,' he told the BBC.  'What I want to see is significant investment back into the UK economy to support jobs, to support energy security, and I want to see that investment soon. If that doesn't happen, then no options are off the table.' But Bowie told HuffPost UK: 'Scotland's economy would be damaged most by a windfall tax. 'I'm of the belief that any windfall tax would hamper investment and cause uncertainty in the North Sea. 'BP and Shell could swallow it given the size of their operation, but medium-sized businesses would find it difficult. Any change to the fiscal framework could lead to jobs being lost and a lack of investment. 'It gets raised with me by these firms all the time. They are firmly against it and I agree with them. 'Every time I meet with the chancellor I raise it with him. He says he is looking at a variety of options, but I very much hope it is not a windfall tax. 'The last time I spoke with the chancellor he was of the opinion that a windfall tax was not his favoured option and I hope that is not the direction he is heading in.' Asked about the government's position on a windfall tax today, the prime minister's official spokesman said: 'We do keep options on the table - rightly so. 'But, as the prime minister has set out, as the chancellor has said, we do not think this is the right approach. 'We want these companies that are making profits to make further investments. But we are simply not cutting off options given the circumstances that we find.'", "9e62c0aecbaf46d681be9260100fc3b9643f636563635f5d2a232e36": "", "d3e8fc56f7919b06cd63fc26809d254c4591174fabc390699eb3931a": "One member of the Bridgerton family will be looking a little bit different when the hit Netflix show returns for its third season. Bosses have announced they have recast the role of Francesca Bridgerton ahead of filming starting this summer.  Hannah Dodd will take over the role from previous actor Ruby Stokes, who has now left the show.  Francesca is the sixth-eldest Bridgerton sibling, and made a handful of appearances in the first two seasons.

So far, the character has been a mystery within her chatty, extroverted family, but her recast suggests she could be about to take a more prominent role in future series.

The Mysterious Girl singer was mentioned in court as Rebekah was quizzed this week about a 2004 newspaper interview she gave about a purported sexual encounter with Peter. The article carried the headline 'Peter's hung like a small chipolata, shaved, slobbery, lasts five minutes,' with Rebekah now admitting she was 'forced into a situation by my ex-husband' to do the interview. Responding to comments about his anatomy being discussed in court, and subsequently in the media, Peter shared a two-minute video on his social accounts revealing he felt like he 'had to say something'.  'Sorry to Emily [his wife] and the children that have had to see and hear some not very nice things,' he wrote in the caption, before going on to say in the video: 'Seeing as I haven't had much of a say in this, and just let everyone have a laugh and whatever, whatever, I'm just going to put it out.  'Fifteen years this has been going on, and I kept quiet and I didn't say anything, and I let everyone have their laugh and I let everyone say what they wanted to say. 'Okay yes, now, [Rebekah] has gone to court and admitted that the story was made up, and she did that because her ex-husband forced her to do it. Fair enough. 'But put that all aside and just think how it feels that if a man, or if I had said this, about her anatomy, or a man said something about a woman's anatomy, and made up something, whatever, I don't know - you can use your imagination - of saying something very unflattering.  'There would be outrage, there would absolute outrage. But because it's been said about me, it's been the butt of all jokes, I've taken it for fifteen years.' He continued: 'Some of you are gonna go, 'oh get over it, don't say anything, whatever'. You've got to understand, what's even worse is it's brought up in a High Court, and the lawyer is bringing it up... and it's brought up again. And the only one that sits there and takes hit after hit about it is me. 'And I'll be laughing about it for a while, but think about how it would feel if it was the other way around, that's all I'm saying.  'Okay yes, I think we all know now it's just a made-up story fine, fine, fine. But it's a little bit more serious than that. And I think it's not fair that something like this can happen again and again and again.

The Oscar nominee played Karen Smith in 2004 film, with her character ending up becoming a weather presenter, following on from an earlier comment in which she said her breasts could 'tell when it's raining'. In a new interview with Marie Claire, Amanda opened up about being recognised as the film grew in popularity, with the magazine claiming this was 'mostly boys asking her if it was raining'. 'I always felt really grossed out by that,' she said. 'I was like 18 years old. It was just gross.' Speaking about fame, Amanda added: 'I think being really famous [young] must really fucking suck. It must make you feel completely unsafe in the world. 'I see these younger actors who think they have to have security. They think they have to have an assistant. They think their whole world has changed. It can get stressful. I've seen it happen to my peers.' Amanda appeared in Mean Girls alongside Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams and Lacey Chabert, who made up the 'plastics' clique, with Tina Fey, Lizzy Caplan and Amy Poehler also among the cast. In the 18 years since its release, the film has gained a loyal following, and even inspired a Broadway musical which ran between 2018 and 2020.

Boris Johnson, his wife and chancellor Rishi Sunak were all fined for attending a birthday party in June 2020 only last month. This was during the first wave of 50 fixed penalty notices issued in the Met's ongoing investigation into Downing Street's Covid breaches. As that number has now more than doubled, the government is coming under further scrutiny. As Johnson decided to hold a cabinet meeting on Thursday Stoke-on-Trent, Sky News' Sam Coates caught the ministers on their way to the gathering - and he didn't hold back. Addressing home secretary Priti Patel, he said: 'Are you embarrassed or are you just going to play deaf to the scale of the law-breaking in No.10. Do you still back the prime minister?' She avoided looking at the camera, briefing saying, 'good morning Sam' and asking the journalist how he is - all the while keeping her gaze steadily on the ground. Michael Gove was up next. He looked directly at the journalist as Coates asked: 'Is it just best to ignore law-breaking in Downing Street Mr Gove, or do you have the full confidence [in] the prime minister?' With a large smile, the levelling up secretary looked at the camera and said: 'Hi Sam!' As Sunak approached, Coates said: 'Chancellor, are you prepared to dig deep to help with the cost of living or is the prime minister going to bounce you into spending more?' The chancellor simply smiled and said, 'morning', before walking on. It wasn't just the cabinet minister who faced a grilling either. When Guto Harri, Downing Street's director of communications, arrived with a crowd of colleagues, Coates asked: 'Guto Harri, is it hard to spin your way out of this one after a hundred fines this morning confirmed by the Met?' Smiling, the spin doctor replied: 'Good morning! How are you?' Nigel Adams - cabinet minister without portfolio - was also filmed arriving for the meeting, prompting the Sky News journalist to ask: 'Have you fixed it for Boris Johnson to get through this despite the scale of law-breaking in No.10?' 'It's great to see you too, Sam,' Adams replied without breaking his stride. 'Wonderful to be here in Stoke.'  Adams actually tweeted about Labour leader Keir Starmer only last week when he was accused of avoiding scrutiny about 'beergate', which is now also under police investigation for breaching Covid rules. He wrote: 'It's not a good look to be dodging questions about #beergate. 'Most voters can spot BS and a #hypocrite from a mile away.' Coates also tweeted clarifying that not all attendees chose to enter the building, where the government will be trying to follow up on its promises from the Queen's Speech, via the TV cameras.", "b88e8088dfad8cdcc5b87ac21376cb761494113d0121627098492769": "More than half of patients who were hospitalised with Covid during the pandemic still experience at least one symptom two years after their first infection, according to new findings. In the longest study of its kind, research published in the Lancet Respiratory Medicine has revealed that even after being discharged, these Covid patients still experience a lower quality of life and poorer health compared to the rest of the general public. Lead author Professor Bin Cao from the China-Japan Friendship hospital said: 'Our findings indicate that for a certain proportion of hospitalised Covid-19 survivors, while they may have cleared the initial infection, more than two years is needed to recover fully.' The research is particularly eye-opening because the long-term effects of contracting Covid have been, for the most part, unknown until now. The longest study before this looked at patients for around 12 months. How was the study conducted? The experts looked at how 1,192 patients who had acute Covid and were hospitalised in Wuhan (the Chinese province where the disease first broke out) between January 7 and May 29 2020. The patient's average age at discharge was 57. The study then checked in with the individuals at six months, 12 months and two years.  They had to take part in a six-minute walking test, lab tests, questionnaires on their symptoms, mental health, quality of life linked to their health, and if they had gone back to work along with their use of healthcare facilities. For comparison, there was a control group of people who had no history of Covid infection. What did the study find? Half a year after the initial infection, 68% of patients reported at least one long Covid symptom. Two years later, this number dropped to 55%, with 31% reporting fatigue and muscle weakness. Around 11% of the individuals in the study had still not returned to work. The participants were also more likely to report other symptoms including joint pain, palpitations, dizziness and headaches along with extra pain, discomfort, anxiety and depression compared to the control group. Professor Cao said: 'Ongoing follow-up of Covid-19 survivors, particularly those with symptoms of long Covid, is essential to understand the longer course of illness, as is further exploration of the benefits of rehabilitation programmes for recovery. 'There is a clear need to provide continued support to a significant proportion of people who've had Covid-19, and to understand how vaccines, emerging treatments and variants affect long-term health outcomes.' But the findings are not concrete As all individuals involved in the study were treated at Jin Yin-tan Hospital, it's not clear what variants they were infected with. The impact of the virus on an individual's health is thought to vary according to which strain they were infected with - new data has even suggested that Omicron is less likely to trigger long Covid than Delta. Many of the symptoms in the study were self-reported too, meaning there is a chance of information bias. How many people have long Covid in the UK? According to Office for National Statistics, around 1.3 million living in private households experienced self-reported long Covid symptoms as of January 2022. This means more than four weeks after their suspected infection, people are still experiencing Covid symptoms, particularly fatigue, shortness of breath, loss of smell and loss of taste. The prevalence of it is greatest in people aged between 35 and 69 in particular women, people who live in more deprived areas, those who work in health care, social care, teaching and education, or those with another underlying health condition. Is the rate of new Covid cases in the UK dropping? New infections in the UK were steadily falling but have now plateaued. The ZOE Covid Study predicts that UK cases will stall around 100,000 per day. Professor Tim Spector, co-founder of the ZOE app, said: 'It is too early at this stage to know what is causing the slowdown but it's a strong signal that Covid is not going to disappear for summer.' However, the number of hospital patients in England with Covid has dropped to below 10,000 in the UK, suggesting infections are not causing such severe symptoms at the moment.", "4207ccc895d6f2215fc1062ce66ca069c4f5f37044b5b2765321580a": "Spain is on its way to becoming the first European country to offer paid menstrual leave, up to three days per month.  The move, set to be introduced from next week after Spain's next cabinet meeting, also welcomes workers to take time off for other reproductive health reasons, such as abortions.  The Secretary of State for Equality and against Gender Violence, Angela Rodriguez, announced a range of measures set to offer women and girls better provisions. The reform also includes free period products to students in school. 'The rights related to menstrual health have never been discussed and the data is chilling,' Rodriguez told a Spanish news website. 'One in four women cannot choose the feminine hygiene products she wants to buy for financial reasons. That is why we propose that they can be dispensed free of charge in educational and social centres.' While not everyone who gets periods will suffer from debilitating symptoms, there are some who experience extreme pain which can be a sign of health conditions such as dysmenorrhea and endometriosis. But the provisions are to be reserved for extreme pain. Rodriguez added: 'It is important to clarify what a painful period is, we are not talking about a slight discomfort, but about serious symptoms such as diarrhoea, severe headaches, fever. 'Symptoms that when there is a disease that entails them, a temporary disability is granted, therefore the same should happen with menstruation and that there is the possibility that if a woman has a very painful period, she can stay home.' Other countries around the world also offer a similar package to menstruating women including Japan, Indonesia, South Korea, and Zambia. So, should the UK be next? And what does it mean for women in the workforce?  While leave that accommodates different needs is certainly welcome, period leave might still perpetuate period stigma. In fact, research shows young women are being subjected to verbal abuse and bullying around their periods, with many of those affected suffering in silence. One in five (20%) of 14-21 year olds has experienced teasing around their periods and made to feel shame, with only half (49%) telling anyone about it. This teasing and bullying often takes place in school - but for one in 10 girls, it has happened online.  Many people have also been missing school and work due to periods, missing out on their work as a result.  Research published in the BMJ in 2019 found 13.8% of women who have periods had missed work or school because of it - but most felt unable to be honest about the reason. Among those who'd called in sick, only 20.1% told their employer or school that their absence was due to menstrual complaints. In Japan, they've considered introducing period badges to alert work staff that a person is menstruating.  But the move faced backlash as it segregates workers and others those who have periods.  It could also lead to discrimination in the workforce, with bosses and companies hiring fewer women over fears of them going on period leave. So what do women need?  Emma Barnett, journalist and author of the book Period told HuffPost: 'I don't think this helps.'   'Women don't need a badge. They need the voice to vocalise any issues their periods present. They also need others - loved ones and colleagues - to rid themselves of their unnecessary and ill-founded squeamishness about a perfectly normal bodily process.' That might certainly be a start.

The Foreign Secretary held what sources described as a 'tetchy' phone call with her European Commission counterpart Maros Sefcovic this morning.  Truss called for the EU to show 'more flexibility and pragmatism' following long-running negotiations. Prior reports suggested she was set to warn Brussels they had just 72 hours to change their position on NI border checks or the UK government would unveil legislation to override the protocol.  The protocol is part of the UK government's Brexit deal that keeps NI aligned with the EU single market for goods as a means of retaining an open Irish border. However, it has resulted in additional checks for goods moving between Great Britain and NI and plunged the region into political crisis.  In a statement, issued after their high stakes call, a Foreign Office spokesperson said: 'The Foreign Secretary noted this with regret and said the situation in Northern Ireland is a matter of internal peace and security for the United Kingdom, and if the EU would not show the requisite flexibility to help solve those issues, then as a responsible government we would have no choice but to act.' Shortly after, Sefcovic also issued a statement saying it was 'simply not acceptable' for the UK to threaten to unilaterally suspend parts of the protocol. Britain has been preparing legislation that would unilaterally override parts of the protocol - which the EU has warned would result in the suspension of the entire Brexit deal. During the call, Truss also made clear the UK's 'overriding priority' was to protect peace and stability in Northern Ireland. She told Sefcovic the protocol had become 'the greatest obstacle' to forming a new NI executive. After last week's elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly, the DUP has refused to enter into a new power sharing administration with Sinn Fein unless there are significant changes to the protocol which governs post-Brexit trading arrangements. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: 'The Foreign Secretary outlined that the UK's overriding priority is to protect peace and stability in Northern Ireland and said that the Northern Ireland Protocol had become the greatest obstacle to forming a Northern Ireland Executive.  'She also noted that the current situation was causing unacceptable disruption to trade and had created a two-tier system where people in Northern Ireland weren't being treated the same as everyone else in the UK. 'She reminded Vice President Sefcovic of the importance of defending the Belfast [Good Friday] Agreement, and said that the commission bore a responsibility to show more pragmatism and ensure the protocol delivered on its original objectives.' Sefcovic said: 'It continues to be of serious concern that the UK government intends to embark on the path of unilateral action. 'I am convinced that only joint solutions will work. Unilateral action, effectively disapplying an international agreement such as the protocol, is simply not acceptable.'

The Conservative for Ashfield triggered an online outcry after he made a speech in the Commons on Wednesday saying a large portion of food bank users simply need to taught these basic skills - despite the crippling cost of living crisis which means millions are skipping meals. On Thursday morning, he defended his claims and told Times Radio that a lot of people out there would be able to stop using food banks with the 'right support and the right education'. He added: 'The point I was trying to make was I think the actual food bank use is exaggerated.' Anderson said he works with a local food bank in Ashfield and they've got a 'wonderful initiative' where people receive one food package but have to sign up to a cooking course along with a budgeting course at the same time. The MP also claimed that he was able to make 170 meals for PS50 by cooking from scratch, using fresh vegetables and meat from the local supermarket while batch cooking. He said this would feed a family of five for a week and a half - suggesting the 'real nub of the problem' is the 'generations of people out there who simply haven't got the skills to 'budget properly'. Referring to the backlash from his remarks in the Commons, he said: 'I'm sort of glad it caused all this fuss because it brings that debate out.' He then claimed he had invited all Labour MPs to join part in these courses and 'as yet not one has accepted'. Anderson said until people had attempted the cooking course in Ashfield, 'you've got no right to comment' on his remarks. 'This not me being a nasty Tory,' Anderson claimed. The MP did then clarify: 'There's always genuine people, Stig, in need. I wasn't making that point. 'The point I was making is that there's a lot of people out there who with the right help and the right support and the right education they will be able to fend for themselves.'  However, shadow communities secretary Lisa Nandy suggested Anderson's comments show the Tories are 'living on another planet'. Speaking to Sky News, she said: ''We've got, at the moment, a crisis that is engulfing families and businesses across the country, record inflation - it's not that people aren't budgeting properly, it's that they simply cannot afford the basics. 'And is a damning inditement of 12 years of a Conservative government.' She said there was a food bank in Wigan which was now giving out 'cold boxes' because people can't actually afford to cook the food they're being given. The Labour MP called for significant government intervention to ease the crisis, explaining: 'We've got to get help to people now, we've got to get money back in their pockets, and most of all we have to stop with this sort of patronising rubbish that this is somehow the fault of families who have seen their income drop dramatically in the last few months.'", "8d667c1991ee68aed08345dec8610bda1d09e7f7d0c29bcdfde86b62": "Scotland Yard has announced it has issued more than 100 fines for covid lockdown breaches as part of its partygate investigation.  The police had been waiting for the local elections to be over before revealing its latest round of fixed penalty notices for gatherings held in Downing Street and Whitehall during lockdown. Previously, the Metropolitan Police had confirmed that 50 fines had been issued over partygate. In a statement, the Met said: 'As of Thursday 12 May, Operation Hillman, the investigation into breaches of Covid-19 regulations in Whitehall and Downing Street, has made more than 100 referrals for fixed penalty notices (FPNs) to the ACRO Criminal Records Office. 'These referrals have continued to be made throughout the period since our last update on Tuesday 12 April and the investigation remains live.' Boris Johnson is not thought to be among those given one of the additional fines. The prime minister, his wife and chancellor Rishi Sunak have previously received fixed penalty notices for attending a birthday party for the PM in 10 Downing Street. A Downing Street source said: 'If the PM receives a further FPN we will let you know, as we always have.' Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said: 'Boris Johnson stood up in Parliament and said Covid rules were followed in Number 10 at all times. 'Now 100 fines have been issued by the police over partygate.

Both sides are locking horns over how to resolve this crisis which could see the whole Brexit agreement torn up and trade war potentially erupting. Here's what you need to know. What is the Northern Ireland protocol? The protocol was proposed as the solution to the Brexit stalemate between the EU and the UK back in 2019. Just months into his time in Downing Street, Boris Johnson signed off on it. It seemed to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, therefore avoiding a revival of any past tensions which have cropped between the two countries. But, it means Northern Ireland now, like the Republic of Ireland, has to follow the EU's trade rules so there's no border checks when goods travel around the island of Ireland. As Northern Ireland technically left the EU along with the rest of the UK but still follows EU's single market rules, border checks had to be introduced in the Irish Sea instead. Anything travelling from Britain to Northern Ireland has to be checked as though coming from a third country. Why is everyone talking about it again now? Unionists have repeatedly said that the protocol separates Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK and disrupts trade ever since it was introduced. Their arguments have come to a head after the Northern Ireland Assembly elections, which saw the main unionist party lose their majority for the first time since the Assembly was established. The DUP (Democratic Unionist Party) is currently refusing to nominate someone to be the deputy first minister. The Northern Ireland executive cannot operate without this role. The DUP claim, until the protocol is addressed, it will not only paralyse the executive but the whole assembly. The party could do this by refusing to back the nomination of an assembly speaker on Friday, which would have enabled the legislative body could operate without an executive. What has the UK said? Foreign secretary Liz Truss said on Tuesday night that the government was going to reject the EU's recent suggestions about how to fix the problem. She said: 'The current EU proposals fail to properly address the real issues affecting Northern Ireland and in some cases would take us backward.' The senior minister suggested that the bloc's reforms would see various chilled meats from Britain needing a vet certificate to enter Northern Ireland, and foods outside of the EU no longer available in the country. She explained: 'Our preference has always been for a negotiated solution but will not shy away from taking action to stabilise the situation in Northern Ireland if solutions cannot be found.' What has the UK proposed? The UK could set up new legislation to unilaterally scrap parts of the Brexit agreement signed in 2020, although Brussels says this would be a breach of the UK's obligations. According to The Times, this could mean scrapping checks on goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland, simultaneously ending the EU's Court of Justice role in the country and allow businesses to stop following the bloc's trade regulations. Truss has promoted a new arrangements which would include a green and red division, along with a bespoke data-sharing system, to reduce the trade barriers down the Irish Sea. A Whitehall source told POLITICO's Playbook: 'What is most disappointing here is Brussels truly holds some remarkable brilliant thinkers and yet the negotiations over the past year have shown the EU still clearly misunderstands what is practically happening in Northern Ireland and the structural issues with the protocol.' How has the EU responded? The EU is refusing to back down or renegotiate the protocol. European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said: 'The protocol, as a cornerstone of the withdrawal agreement, is an international agreement. Its renegotiation is not an option. The European Union is united in this position.' This was echoed by the German chancellor Olaf Scholz who said: 'No one should unilaterally cancel, break or in any way attack the settlement we have agreed together.'  Ireland's Taoiseach Micheal Martin has also admitted that the protocol issues were 'very serious'. However, Belgian prime minister Alexander De Cross would be happy to cancel the entire Brexit deal, claiming he could not see any 'other solution'. So...What happens next? Truss met Sefcovic on Thursday in a bid to resolve the tensions, but they were not able to find a solution. She told the EU representative that the Commissions bore a responsibility to show more pragmatism and ensure the protocol delivers on its original objectives. According to the Foreign Office's breakdown of their meeting, Sefcovic simply said there was 'no room to expand' the EU negotiating mandate or introduce new proposals to reduce the trade friction - to which Truss replied that as a 'responsible government we would have no choice but to act'.  The foreign secretary is likely to now be considering announcing the radical bill (which would unilaterally scrap parts of the protocol) next Tuesday, even if the EU has not acted by then. Levelling up secretary Michael Gove warned on Wednesday that 'no option is off the table' when it comes to fixing the problems.

In the episode, heartbreakingly titled Deborah James' Last Dance, the presenter and campaigner talked from her parents' garden to friend and producer Mike Holt about her decision to end 'active treatment' for the bowel cancer she's had since 2016. She has now switched to palliative hospice care at home with her family because, in her own words, 'my body simply isn't playing ball'. James, who goes by the name Bowelbabe on social media, also spoke movingly about her co-hosts, Lauren Mahon, now in remission, Rachael Bland, who died of cancer in September 2018, and Rachael's widow, Steve. 'Rach is always in my mind even now,' said James. 'I just don't know how brave she must have been to do what she did because I don't feel that brave. 'I think I am still in awe of how she seemed to take it in her stride. Quite frankly, I'm a quivering mess half the time. But I think if she can do it, I can do it. I'll go and party with her.' On Tuesday, James launched a Bowelbabe fund that has already raised a staggering PS3m for charity as members of the public follow her request to 'buy her a drink' by donating money to future cancer research. But in the final moments of the podcast, she had just two asks to make. 'We'll see each other again, somewhere, somehow, dancing, and until then, please, please enjoy life because it is so precious. l can't tell you. All I want right now is more time and more life,' she said, her voice breaking as she spoke. 'Oh and also, check your poo. I can't leave on any other word apart from check your poo. I still have images of me dancing in poo outfits everywhere. So maybe I should leave on that final word. Check your poo.' Bleeding or blood can be a 'red flag' symptom of bowel cancer, but only a third of people are aware of this, according to the charity Bowel Cancer UK. What are the main symptoms of bowel cancer?  Deborah James is not alone in using her platform to raise awareness of bowel cancer. Newsreader George Alagiah recently discussed how his diagnosis has changed his whole outlook on life, while Radio 1 DJ Adele Roberts has been open about her time out in October 2021 for surgery to remove a tumour. However, recent research by Bowel Cancer UK for Bowel Cancer Awareness Month in April suggested awareness levels aren't where they should be. More than four in 10 people cannot name a single bowel cancer symptom, according to a survey by the charity - with awareness lowest among men. Half of UK men (55%) were unable to spot the signs, compared to 36% of women.  This is Bowel Cancer UK's list of the most common symptoms of bowel cancer, experienced by many who go on to be diagnosed with the disease.    Bleeding from your bottom and/or blood in your poo   A persistent and unexplained change in bowel habit    Unexplained weight loss   Extreme tiredness for no obvious reason   A pain or lump in your tummy    As Bowel Cancer UK stresses, these symptoms don't mean you definitely have cancer, as each of these symptoms can be caused by other health problems. But if you are experiencing one or more or, as the charity says, 'things just don't feel right', you should speak to your GP. If you think you have a blocked bowel, you should also see a doctor straight away or go to your nearest A&E. Don't be embarrassed by bowel issues If you have any of the symptoms listed above, contact your GP 'as early as possible', advises Dr Philippa Kaye, author and a bowel cancer patient herself. 'As both a GP and someone who has had bowel cancer, I completely understand it can be daunting visiting your GP with symptoms. However it is so important that you book an appointment as early as possible - please don't feel embarrassed, don't ignore any symptoms and don't put it off,' says Dr Kaye. 'As GPs we are used to seeing lots of people with bowel problems and if you are worried that something is wrong we want to see you. Early diagnosis could save your life.' In a statement to HuffPost UK, Genevieve Edwards, chief executive of Bowel Cancer UK, echoes this advice, praising James for her closing podcast message, which she called a 'crucial' reminder. 'Deborah has always worked tirelessly to raise awareness of bowel cancer, and her determination to continue helping others is shining a huge spotlight on bowel cancer and its symptoms,' Edwards says.  'There is no doubt that lives have been saved, and will be saved now and in the future, thanks to the increase in awareness of the disease and its symptoms that Deborah has generated.' She adds: 'Bowel cancer is treatable and curable, especially if diagnosed early.'  So, let's all take a long hard look in the loo - it's what Bowelbabe wants us to do.", "5175185bfc99f010e7d6192eb388b27d2942a09c75fd04acdea3bf73": "Two members of the anti-Kremlin punk activist collective Pussy Riot have revealed the daring way they evaded police restrictions and surveillance to leave Russia. Lucy Shtein and Maria 'Masha' Alyokhina, who are a couple, tricked officers surrounding Shtein's Moscow apartment by donning food delivery worker disguises. They managed to escape the country amid a heightened crackdown on anti-Putin sentiment as the Russian president's invasion of Ukraine falters on. 'It was really convenient that delivery couriers have such big bags. I even managed to put my beloved Mr. Rat in the bag,' Shtein, who left Russia in March, told The Guardian newspaper. Mr. Rat is her pet rat.  'We have become so used to delivery couriers roaming Moscow, so it was a foolproof way to escape,' she added. Alyokjina had initially planned to stay in Russia but followed her girlfriend out of the country last week. They have since reunited in Lithuania. Alyokjina detailed her dangerous escape to CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday, recalling staying at safe houses and her multiple attempts at crossing the Belarus-Lithuania border.

The singer shared a loved up picture showing her and the US sports agent each holding a set of keys outside their new home.  Adele revealed the relationship update in a series of snaps she posted to Instagram on Wednesday that charted her romance with Rich.  'Time flies,' she wrote.  The couple were first publicly linked last year, and were rumoured to be engaged after sporting a ring on her engagement ring at this year's Brit Awards - something she didn't deny during a later interview on The Graham Norton Show. She previously how they first met, saying during her interview with Oprah Winfrey on her US TV special One Night Only: 'I met him at a birthday party, we were on the dance floor. And then we met a couple years later. 'We went out for dinner, which he says was a business meeting and I'm like 'A business meeting about what?' And then it was the first time we hung out on our own.  'Without friends and I think that was a natural way that people would meet each other in real life.' Earlier this month, Adele - who officially finalised her divorce from ex-husband Simon Konecki in March 2021 - said she's 'never been happier' as she shared a thankful message with fans on her 34th birthday. The singer said she had 'so many blessings to be grateful for' as she reflected on the previous 12 months, which also saw her release her long-awaited fourth studio album 30. 'What a difference a year makes!' Adele wrote on Instagram. 'If time keeps healing and smoothing out all the creases in my life like it does as the years fly by, then I can't wait to be 60! 'I've never been happier! So many lessons, so many blessings to be grateful for. 'This is 34, and I love it here! Thank you for the birthday love as always x.' This year will see Adele performing for fans again - five years after she was forced to cancel dates at Wembley Stadium on doctor's orders. She will play two nights at Hyde Park's British Summer Time festival in July, while she is also expected to announce her rescheduled Las Vegas residency. Adele pulled the plug on the US dates at the last minute in January due to the show not being ready. In a Graham Norton interview the following month, she said she is 'working her arse off' to reschedule the dates, and that it will '100% happen this year'.", "28cb331c75d989f5e9b832c7247d9339df2381694e85be6922f28b00": "In a speech in Manchester on Tuesday, Prince William opened up about living with grief. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited the city to open and attend a memorial, called the Glade of Light, in honour of the victims of the 2017 terrorist attack at Manchester Arena. Twenty-two people were killed by a suicide bomber at an Ariana Grande concert on May 22, 2017, and more than 50 people were seriously injured. An estimated 800 further victims suffered physical and psychological wounds. William spoke about visiting the city just after the attack, saying he remembered 'only too well the shock and grief on the faces of those I met.' 'Five years on, I know that the pain and the trauma felt by many has not gone away,' the duke said. 'As someone who lives with his own grief, I also know that what often matters most to the bereaved is that those we have lost are not forgotten,' he went on, in an apparent reference to his mother, Princess Diana, who died in 1997, when William was 15. 'There is comfort in remembering. In acknowledging that, while taken horribly soon, they lived. They changed our lives. They were loved and they are loved.' 'It is why memorials such as the Glade of Light are so important,' William said. 'Why Catherine and I so wanted to be amongst you today.'  The duke has mentioned his own grief in public remarks before, alluding to his mother's death in a powerful speech against extremism after a terror attack in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019. William and his brother, Prince Harry, unveiled a memorial to their late mother last year, on what would have been her 60th birthday. The statue, created by sculptor Ian Rank-Broadley, occupies a permanent space in Kensington Palace's Sunken Garden. 'Today, on what would have been our Mother's 60 birthday, we remember her love, strength and character -- qualities that made her a force for good around the world, changing countless lives for the better,' the brothers said in a statement at the time. 'Every day, we wish she were still with us,' they continued.

Conservative Lee Anderson told the Commons there was 'not this massive use for food banks'.  'You've got generation after generation who cannot cook properly. They can't cook a meal from scratch. They cannot budget,' he said. Speaking to Sky News on Thursday morning, prisons minister Victoria Atkins said that was 'absolutely not right'. 'This is not the view of me or anyone else in government. We want to give not just immediate help but longer-term support as well,' she said. 'I've spent my ministerial career working with very vulnerable people ... cooking lessons will not be the complete solution to that.' Anderson has defended his comments, arguing they have been misinterpreted.  'I did not say poor people cannot cook or there is no need for food banks. I said there is not the need currently being parrotted out by the MSM [mainstream media],' he wrote on Facebook. 'Today I challenged the whole Parliamentary Labour Party to come to Ashfield to visit the food bank I work with. The give food parcels away on the condition the enrole for cooking and budgeting lessons.' Labour branded Anderson's remarks 'beyond belief', the Lib Dems described them as 'disgraceful' and the SNP said they were 'crass'. The Child Poverty Action Group claimed politicians 'would do better to back real-world solutions, like bringing benefits in line with inflation this autumn'. While the Trussell Trust charity insisted 'cooking meals from scratch won't help families keep the lights on or put food on the table, if they don't have enough money in their pockets'.

The prime minister failed to answer the question when asked by LBC's Nick Ferrari whether he was 'out of touch'. Johnson - who has two young children with his wife Carrie - also refused to answer when asked how much a pack of nappies cost from Boots. The PM is under increasing pressure to offer more help to those struggling with the cost of living after the Queen's Speech was criticised for offering no new support. Speaking to Johnson on a flight back from Helsinki, Finland, Ferrari asked: 'You stand accused of running an administration that's out of touch with the common man or woman. 'You have a supremely rich chancellor of the exchequer with a non-dom wife who doesn't know how to put petrol in his own car. 'Can you tell me you are in touch with people?' Ferrari asked the PM how much he thought 24 Pampers nappies cost at Boots. Johnson replied: 'I'm not going to get into...what I can tell you is that we will do everything we can to help people through a difficult time.' After refusing to answer whether he economised in the current climate, Ferrari then moved on to the energy price cap. 'What's the value of the price cap currently?' he asked. 'I'm not going to get into that.' 'Do you not know that prime minister?' Ferrari continued. Johnson replied: 'What we will do is make sure that we help people afford their weekly outgoings and the best way to deal with the energy price cap...is to make sure that we are not only helping people in the short term, it's helping people immediately.' Ferrari interrupted: 'It's PS1,971, just to help you out.' The prime minister set hares running when he said during the Queen's Speech debate on Tuesday that the chancellor would say more on the matter 'in the days to come'. However, the Treasury appeared blindsided by the move, with one Sunak ally telling HuffPost UK there were 'no announcements as far as we are aware'. Meanwhile, Lee Anderson, the Tory MP for Ashfield, has been criticised after he claimed people used food banks because they cannot 'cook a meal from scratch' or budget. His comments were immediately criticised as out of touch by Labour and MPs from other parties. Tory minister Victoria Atkins also condemned the comments this morning, saying Anderson's view was 'not the view of me or anyone else in government'. Energy bills have spiralled since the sector's regulator, Ofgem, raised the price cap in April. The government is under pressure to bring in measures that would provide immediate relief to struggling families, including a windfall tax on the profits on energy giants. In his LBC interview, Johnson repeatedly refused to rule out bringing in a windfall tax but he also said: 'I don't like them. I didn't think they're the right thing. 'I don't think they're the right way forward.

Joining the US-led military alliance would mark a radical break in the policy of both north east European countries, underlining once again how Vladamir Putin's aggression has reshaped the post-Cold War order.  On Wednesday, British prime minister Boris Johnson toured both countries and formalised bilateral security agreements during a whirlwind 24 hours. Johnson said his government would give the countries 'whatever is requested' as part of the new pact. Here are some of the issues that have led to the Nordic rethink about entering the 30-nation alliance.  What is Nato?   The military alliance goes by the acronym of Nato.   The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation was formed in 1949 to prevent a resurgence of nationalism and militarism in Europe after two world wars, and to deter the Soviet Union's expansion.   Its membership has swelled to 30 member nations, and over the 1990s and 2000s its enlargement stretched further east to include the former Soviet republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.   They agree to mutual defence - military action - in response to an enemy attack. The principle goes: 'An attack against one ally is considered as an attack against all allies.' This is Article 5 of the Nato constitution.    Ukraine is not a member of Nato, which is the main reason why the Western support for Volodymyr Zelenskyy has fallen short of putting their troops on the ground. Ukraine's admission to Nato has been a stated goal going back to its constitution in 2002, but Ukraine's president has accepted his country can't join at present. Nato's enlargement has been Putin's biggest publicly-stated grievance with the West during the build-up up to war, claiming the eastward expansion and potentially sweeping up the largest other former Soviet republic breaks promises. Adding Sweden and Finland is likely to trigger Putin's ire too. Moscow has warned it could deploy nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles in Russia's Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad - sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania - if they do. Nato has been adamant it will not accept limits on the nations that it admits and has always maintained an 'open door policy'. What is Finland and Sweden's position?    Russia's invasion of Ukraine has pushed Finland and Sweden to the verge of applying for Nato membership, a move that would end staunch military neutrality for the two European nations. Finland, which shares a 1,300-km (810-mile) border with Russia, announced on Thursday that they're in favour of apply ing for Nato membership. In a joint statement, the country's president Sauli Niinisto and prime minister Sanna Marin pointed out that 'Nato membership would strengthen Finland's security'. They added that they would apply 'without delay' in the next few days, although a few steps remain before the country can become an official part of the alliance. Neighbouring Sweden is expected to announce its decision in the coming days. Any applications will usher in a tense wait during the months it takes to be ratified by all Nato members, though the alliance and the White House have said they were confident any security concerns could be addressed in the interim. Both countries have been non-aligned militarily since the Second World War, but have been edging towards their current position in response to an increasingly belligerent Russia.  Finland and Sweden switched from formal neutrality to military non-alignment in 1995 when they joined the European Union, and both have drawn closer to Nato in recent years, exchanging intelligence and participating in alliance exercises.  What is 'Finlandisation'? Finland gained independence from Russia in 1917 and fought two wars against it during the Second World War, where it lost some territory to Moscow. Finland signed an Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance with Russia in 1948, cementing a degree of economic and political dependency and isolating it militarily from western Europe. The strict policy of neutrality is referred to as 'Finlandisation'.  The end of the Cold War, bringing a break-up of the Soviet Union, allowed Finland to step out of Russia's shadow as the threat from Moscow diminished. It has relied on its own military deterrence and friendly relations with Moscow to keep the peace. But with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, perceptions of relations with Russia as 'friendly' have been undermined. Opinion polls show support for membership in Finland is high, with people mindful of the long land border it shares with Russia. Support in parliament for an application is also broad. Sweden's post-Cold War cuts Sweden has not fought a war for 200 years and post-war foreign policy has focused on supporting democracy internationally, multilateral dialogue and nuclear disarmament. It ran down its military after the Cold War, cutting defence spending of up to four percent of its GDP to about one percent during the 1990s and early 2000s. Despite Putin's offensive, many on the left in Sweden remain suspicious of the US security agenda and Nato, which ultimately relies on the deterrence provided by America's nuclear arsenal. Polls show a substantial majority of Swedes back joining Nato, with support running just above 60% in the latest poll, and there is a majority in parliament in support of an application. When could they join? Finland has a Nato 'option', a kind of a plan of action that mandates applying if the security situation deteriorates, while Sweden's parliament will present a new security policy review on Friday, though the latter is not expected to contain an explicit recommendation concerning Nato. Sweden's ruling Social Democrats have called a parliamentary debate over Nato for Monday. Should the party as expected back joining, the government could call a vote about sending through an application, but it is not formally required to.", "b5aca8af12b8547af78378d05a03f8fa8fa4e8340211f7a64f522b9d": "Selena Gomez is shutting down rumours that she threw shade at Hailey Bieber. After Selena posted a look at her skin care routine on TikTok earlier this week, some fans accused her of subtly mocking a video that Hailey had posted just hours earlier. Hailey, who married Selena's ex Justin Bieber in 2018, shared a 'get ready with me' video to TikTok showing fans her beauty routine. Later, Selena posted a video of her own, showcasing her skin care routine to Fleetwood Mac's Dreams. Selena - whose 2019 song Lose You To Love Me was widely thought to be about Justin Bieber - took to her comments section to clear the air about the misunderstanding.  'This is why I believe in taking care of your mental health. Guys no idea what I did but I really am sorry. Zero bad intention. Deleting soon,' Selena commented on her video, as seen in a screenshot from a fan. Still, some fans continued to speculate about possible tension between Selena and Hailey, given the timing of Selena's video. 'LOL I know who she's referring to,' one commenter wrote on Selena's TikTok video. 'Wait ... is she tryna make fun of you know who,' another commenter wrote. The Wizards of Waverly Place leading lady later turned off comments on the video. Selena said goodbye to her on-and-off relationship with Justin months before he wedded Hailey. The couple have been married since 2018. Over the years, fans have theorised that Selena and Hailey Bieber hold resentment toward each other, but the two women have always denied the rumours.

Wakefield deputy council leader Jack Hemingway was one of a number of candidates vying to become the city's next MP following the conviction of Tory Imran Ahmad Khan for child sexual abuse. The by-election is seen as a must-win for Labour, given the circumstances surrounding the contest and the opportunity it provides for the party to claim it is winning back its former heartlands. But in a surprise move, Hemingway has been left off the longlist of candidates being considered. HuffPost UK understands the Leader of the Opposition's Office (Loto) was concerned about some of Hemingway's social media posts. A Labour source said: 'We don't block candidates for no good reason -- they must be thinking of the last leadership.' In one deleted post from July 2018, Hemingway said adopting the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of anti-Semitism would be a 'disastrous move'. In another post, Hemingway called for Corbyn to be reinstated as a party member after he was suspended over his response to the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) report into anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. The EHRC found evidence of unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination while Corbyn was leader.  In response to the report, Corbyn said allegations about anti-Jewish racism on his watch had been 'dramatically overstated' by his political opponents. Corbyn was reinstated as a Labour member in November 2020 but he still does not have the party whip, meaning he sits as an independent MP. Hemingway told HuffPost UK: 'I'm a committed anti-racist and I think anti-Semitism is a scourge that should be eradicated. 'I've never hid the fact that I supported Jeremy Corbyn for leader and I voted for Rebecca Long-Bailey to be deputy...but I have always respected Keir's right to lead the party.' Hemingway also pointed out that as soon as the EHRC report was published he called for the party to adopt the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism in full. HuffPost UK understands that Loto wants either Kate Dearden, who works for the Community union, or Simon Lightwood, a former staffer for ex-Wakefield MP Mary Creagh, to be the party's by-election candidate. Both are known to have supported Remain in the EU referendum, which some local sources say may be a disadvantage in a seat that voted to leave the EU by 66.3 per cent. When Dearden confirmed via Twitter that she was standing in the by-election, her post was retweeted by Deborah Mattinson, Starmer's director of strategy. The retweet was later undone. Other candidates who have confirmed they want to stand for Labour in Wakefield include Sam Howarth, who used to work for Starmer's ex-political secretary Jenny Chapman, and who now works for Dan Jarvis MP. Wakefield councillor Michael Graham has also confirmed he is seeking the Labour nomination, as is law student Jakob Williamson. One Labour insider told HuffPost UK: 'Loto have seen Jack's tweets and they are not happy. 'They are going to put it down to two names: Kate and Simon. And they are going to keep Jack off.' A local source said: 'The most important thing is that we have a candidate that can withstand a by-election. 'You've got to have a candidate that is fireproof. 'Keir Starmer simply cannot afford to lose this -- end of. He's got to win, and he's got to be very, very careful that he gets the right candidate. 'Keir is trying to put out a particular image and he cannot afford to take any risks.' A Labour source with knowledge of the region said there was a perception within the local constituency Labour party (CLP) that the candidate shortlist would be a stitch-up. 'The CLP are convinced that their local choices are going to be blocked,' they said. 'It's pretty clear that the leaders' office want Dearden, and a screen grab of Deborah Mattinson retweeting her launch has spread like wild fire as proof of that. 'Locally there's a feeling that the higher ups have made their mind up of who is acceptable and who isn't. 'Everyone is really worried that it'll be a shortlist of non local people foisted on us so we have to choose the lesser of the evils not who we really want.  'Kate is not from Wakefield and doesn't know the membership. There's going to be a big push back against anyone seen as being parachuted in. 'It's not the sort of place that will take kindly to it.' A local party member added: 'The CLP have made it clear they want someone who has a genuine connection to the area and not someone who has been flown in.' The NEC drew up its longlist on Wednesday, with shortlisting and interviews taking place on Thursday. Hustings will be held on Sunday May 15, when local members will choose the candidate. A Labour Party spokesperson said: 'Working people in Wakefield have been badly let down by Boris Johnson's Conservatives, who ignored serious allegations of child sexual assault against their paedophile former MP Imran Ahmad Khan before his election. 'Wakefield deserves better and our selection process is now underway. 'Party members in the constituency will consider a shortlist in the coming days and be able to choose the Labour candidate to be Wakefield's new MP.' Labour lost Wakefield to the Tories by 3,358 votes at the 2019 general election after holding the seat since 1932. Imrad Ahmad Khan tendered his resignation on May 3, three weeks after he was found guilty of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy. A date for the by-election has yet to be announced.

You can submit a question here.  When you're first dating someone everything feels so exciting. From speaking to them every day, going on dates and feeling butterflies when you see them, it feels like you're on cloud 9. But sometimes in this honeymoon phase we can get so caught up with the romance, it can blind us from our actual feelings. Do we actually like our new found lover or do we just like the attention they give us? This week's reader Carol writes in asking: 'How do I know if I like someone or like the attention they're giving me? I've started dating someone and we have fun together, but I'm not sure if I like him or like the attention.' How do we know when we like someone?  Counselling Directory Claire Elmes says 'when we like someone everything feels more exciting and positive'.  'You may start to notice your thoughts and feelings change to be centred around them such as starting to like the same things, or missing them when they aren't around,' she says.  'Our bodies have physiological changes when we like someone and we release dopamine and norepinephrine which can make us feel excited and energetic and almost euphoric. Oxytocin levels also increase which boost attachment and safety feelings and can also make us feel a bit uneasy if relationships have been difficult in the past.' How do we know when we only like the attention someone is giving us?  Elmes advises watching out for these signs:    You may not be interested with them as a person, and find it difficult to get to know them on a deeper level.    You may get lonely easily when they're not around.   It can be hard to know whether we like a person or if we just like the attention they are giving us, especially as all of us like to feel special and so if we get positive attention from someone we are likely to respond with positive emotions.    Do you tell others about the other person? Sometimes if we just enjoy the attention that a person gives us we won't find them exciting to speak about and therefore don't tell our friends and family about them.    How can we tell someone that we don't have feelings for them without hurting them? 'Communicate with the other person in a warm and kind way, express that you currently don't have feelings for the individual in a clear but warm way,' says Elmes. 'Don't ignore them - it's important to confront the issue and give an explanation that you do not have feelings for someone rather than ignore them. Being ignored can be hurtful for the individual, and is often the least effective way to let someone know you don't have feelings for them.' If you are confident in your decision and your feelings, Elmes says it's important not to give the person false hope by putting the decision off (while you soak up that attention).  If you only like hanging out with someone for the attention - but can't see a future with them - it's not fair on the other person.  'This may lead to them having hopes for the future, and eventually getting let down and hurt when this doesn't happen,' says Elmes.  'It is also useful to remember that feelings grow over time so if you are not sure it might be useful to explore this with the person. Sometimes love grows and depending on the past relationships of both parties it might be that you get to know each other first.'

More than two years on from the first Covid lockdown, many of us are still working from home, at least some of the time.  Working remotely comes with a load of pros (no long dreary commute being a major one), but if your work setup at home isn't right, it can have a serious impact on your mood and productivity, not to mention job satisfaction.  Perhaps your home office felt like a dream at first, but is now as messy and uninspiring as the actual office. Whether it's overly cramped thanks to a lack of storage, bland and boring because you've run out of steam, or causing you actual physical pain, it's time to make some changes.  The good news is that some simple buys, from a healthy houseplant to the right desk chair, can make all the difference - and needn't cost a lot either. We've rounded up some cheap and cheery essentials to upgrade your workspace and help you fall for WFH all over again.", "9e6b401a82f4526be0a4ecea5b3ea51f80cd2f59122de4c3b000b7b1": "Since finishing in second place at Eurovision in 2019, it's safe to say that Italian singer Mahmood's star has only continued to rise. Not only has his track Soldi swiftly become a modern-day classic of the competition, held up by the BBC and Eurovision icon Mans Zelmermow as one of the best entries of all time, Mahmood also achieved huge highs in his career. He has broken streaming records in his home country of Italy, and just last week performed a sold out show at London's Shepherd's Bush Empire where he was given a welcome usually reserved for the likes of Harry Styles or Shawn Mendes. This year, he's returning to the competition alongside fellow Italian singer Blanco with their theatrical ballad Brividi. Since the pair's duet won the Italian selection show (the Sanremo Music Festival) in February, the track has reached number one in multiple countries, racked up 50 million views on YouTube and even landed among the top five most listened-to songs on Spotify worldwide. Not bad, considering Mahmood wasn't even sure whether to enter the song at Sanremo at all. 'It took me seven days to decide,' he admits to HuffPost UK, recalling Blanco's initial text message suggesting they take Brividi to the national competition. 'I'd already done Sanremo, and already won. So, I thought, 'is it better to be left with a good memory, or do we want to take a risk and try it again?'. Finally, I said that in life, if you don't take a risk, you are already dead. So I said, 'OK, let's go again to Sanremo'.' Now gearing up to return to the Eurovision stage, this time on his home soil, Mahmood's song with Blanco has been among the bookies' favourites for the win since its debut. Here's what he had to tell us ahead of this year's competition.... Were you always a fan of Eurovision, and how has your opinion of it changed over time? In reality, Italy hasn't always been a part of Eurovision. So, in Italy, the Sanremo Music Festival is much more visible, and Italian people are really attached to that. But Eurovision has become more famous in our country since around four or five years ago. And now Eurovision in Italy is really big. Do you have a favourite memory of being part of Eurovision? After the final in 2019, there were great parties. And I remember someone gave me a cocktail with my face on it - so that was really, really incredible, like a movie. No, that's the funny [answer]. The emotional [answer] is being in Tel Aviv for the first time, seeing a new country for the first time. I remember the people working for Eurovision were so professional, so precise. I'd never seen anything like that before in Italy. What are your all-time three favourite Eurovision songs? In 2011, Raphael Gualazzi went to Eurovision with Follia D'Amore. I loved that song, and he actually came in second place too! It was a little bit jazzy, and I love jazz. In Italy, it's not so popular, so when Rapahel Gualazzi represented with a pop-jazzy song, for me, he felt like a kind of innovator. And I remember in Tel Aviv, I was in a disco club, and everybody was dancing,. At one point they played Fuego by Eleni Foureira, and it was massive! People went crazy, and so I remember dancing like crazy to that. And maybe Waterloo by ABBA is another favourite, too. I really like that one. Why is Eurovision still so important? It's so important because it represents music from all over Europe. It's one of the biggest shows outside of America, you know? And also for people like French singers, Spanish singers or Italian singers, it's a huge platform to show a different type of music. For example, a lot of the songs this year are all in different styles. In Italy, music is so different to other countries, so it's important for Eurovision to show the different styles of other countries to all of Europe. Are you feeling any pressure ahead of competing at Eurovision, particularly as you did so well the first time around? No, we don't think about it. The only pressure that I have in this moment is that all the things that will go into the performance have to be perfect. Because it's not going to be a simple stage, you know? It's a huge stage. And to make sure it's a great performance, we have to check everything. We want to do the song justice. I'm zero competitive. I'm really competitive [when it comes to my own] music, you know, I want to do good music and do a great performance. But for me, competition [with others] in music is not a good thing. Because in a competition, where is art? Really, my biggest goal will be to do a great performance on stage. The rest is not important for me. This interview has been edited for clarity and length. We'll be publishing an interview with a new Eurovision legend every day leading up to this year's live final on Saturday 14 May. Come back tomorrow when we'll be speaking to this year's UK hopeful Sam Ryder.

Host Fiona Bruce announced at the end of last week's programme that the outspoken German driver would be on the next panel in Hackney, London.  But there was a wave of excitement on social media when Question Time's Twitter feed paraded this week's guests ahead of Thursday's broadcast. Vettel has voiced his opinions on various political topics over the years, notably the environment and LGBT+ rights. Earlier this month he turned up at the Miami Grand Prix wearing a T-shirt suggesting it would be the first Formula 1 race to take place underwater thanks to climate change. When asked why he was appearing on QT, Vettel said it was a 'different format' and there will probably be 'different sorts of questions or topics to be spoken about'. It's unclear whether Vettel has actually seen the, at times, free-wheeling show that has given a platform to a philosophy graduate to 'vaxx-plain' to a vaccines expert, seen an audience member kicked off, and brought the 'passionate Highlander' to prominence. It was perhaps the prospect of a delicious encounter between a sporting great and the unpredictable British public that led to the online reaction. "}
