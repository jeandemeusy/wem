  "32b3dd8f7adaaa65f2db4ae9a582c04144a7cfa3cc28e3f5182e9d4c": "Boris Johnson boasted of giving free bus passes to pensioners today - after being told about a 77-year-old widow who travels London all day because she cannot heat her home. The Prime Minister faces an uncomfortable grilling on Good Morning Britain today about the cost-of-living crisis facing Britons, including soaring bills.  Presenter Susannah Reid raised the plight of Elsie, whose energy costs in her council flat have risen from PS17 to PS85 a month. In the No10 interview, Ms Reid told how Elsie leaves home early and rides buses using a freedom pass, which allows the over-60s on London unlimited travel, in order to not have to heat her flat. Asked what else Elsie should cut back on, he said: 'I don't want Elsie to cut back on anything, let's talk about Elsie and what we are doing and - just to remind you that the 24-hour freedom bus pass was something that I actually introduced.' Susannah Reid: 'Elsie is a widow and she is a pensioner who lives in a council house. She receives a pension of PS170 a week, her energy bills have gone, get this, from PS17 a month to PS85 a month. She will pay an additional PS816 a year.  'To cut down on spending, Prime Minister, Elsie has now resorted to eating one meal a day, she is 77 years old. She is losing weight. She goes to the supermarket at the end of the day to buy yellow-stickered discounted items, she gets up early in the morning to use her freedom bus pass to stay on buses all day to avoid using energy at home. What else should Elsie cut back on in your opinion?' Boris Johnson: 'I don't want Elsie to cut back on anything, let's talk about Elsie and what we are doing and - just to remind you that the 24-hour freedom bus pass was something that I actually introduced...' Reid: 'So Elsie should be grateful to you for her bus pass? What else should she cut back on?' Johnson: 'There are plenty of things more that we are doing. What we want to do is make sure we have people who are in particular hardship looked after by their councils, we are putting much more money into local councils. Wwe have the particular payments to help elderly people in particular with the cost of heating.' 'So Elsie should be grateful to you for her bus pass? What else should she cut back on?' Ms Reid replied. Mr Johnson went on: 'There are plenty of things more that we are doing. What we want to do is make sure we have people who are in particular hardship looked after by their councils, we are putting much more money into local councils. We have the particular payments to help elderly people in particular with the cost of heating.'  Shadow employment rights minister Justin Madders said: 'I really don't think the response to a pensioner traveling all day on a bus to avoid using energy at home is to claim credit for a bus pass system- he really doesn't have a clue or any answers.' Mr Johnson also insisted the Government is doing 'everything we can' to help with the cost-of-living crisis, but warned that increasing state support beyond its current levels could drive inflation even higher. There is a 'global context' caused by a surge in energy prices which is hitting all aspects of the economy including food, he said, adding: 'The cost of chickens is crazy.' On energy, Mr Johnson said: 'This country is in the insane position of having to take in, pipe in, electricity from France and elsewhere because we haven't done enough to invest in our own security of energy and electricity.' The PM also distanced himself from remarks by Chancellor Rishi Sunak last week in which he suggested the Government could 'look again' at a windfall tax on energy firms.  Both Labour and the Lib Dems are pushing for a one-off levy on massive profits made by firms at the same time families struggle with their costs. Mr Johnson warned that a windfall tax on energy companies would deter investment, and set out why taxpayer support for households has to be managed to avoid fuelling inflation.  'If you put a windfall tax on the energy companies, what that means is that you discourage them from making the investments that we want to see that will, in the end, keep energy price prices lower for everybody,' he said. Petrol and diesel prices could hit new records within weeks - just in time for the Platinum Jubilee bank holiday getaway in early June. Analysis by the AA found wholesale prices surged by 5p a litre last week - a rise which takes two to three weeks to be passed on at the pumps. It could mean a repeat of the situation in March, when prices were hitting new records daily. Average fuel prices were 162.4p a litre for petrol and 176.5p for diesel last week, down from a record 167.3p and 179.9p. The AA's Luke Bosdet said: 'Drivers need to brace themselves for a jump in the cost of petrol.' It is the latest hammer blow for Britain's 33million motorists, many of whom are already feeling the pinch and cutting back on journeys due to the spiralling cost of living. Challenged about benefits failing to keep pace with rising inflation, he said: 'We have a short-term hit caused by the spike in energy prices across the world.  'If we respond by driving up prices and costs across the board in this country, responding by the Government stepping in and driving up inflation, that will hit everybody. 'And that will mean that people's interest rates on their mortgages go up, the cost of borrowing goes up, and we face an even worse problem.' The Government has set out a PS9 billion package of loans to cut energy bills and council tax rebates, but Mr Johnson faces calls to go further. On ITV's Good Morning Britain, the Prime Minister said: 'I accept that those contributions from the taxpayer - because that's what it is, taxpayers' money - isn't going to be enough immediately to cover everybody's costs.' Put to him that that means the Government is not doing everything it can, Mr Johnson admitted: 'There is more that we can do. 'But the crucial thing is to make sure we deal with the prices over the medium and long term.' BP today notched up its highest quarterly underlying profits for more than a decade thanks to rocketing oil and gas prices as calls mount for a windfall tax on the sector. The oil giant saw underlying replacement cost profits - its preferred measure - more than double to 6.2 billion US dollars (PS5 billion) for the first three months of the year from 2.6 billion US dollars (PS2.1 billion) a year ago. But on a statutory basis, BP swung to a 23 billion US dollar (PS18.4 billion) loss after taking a mammoth 25.5 billion US dollar (PS20.4 billion) hit from its move to ditch its near-20 per cent stake in Russian oil producer Rosneft in response to the Ukraine war. The underlying result was far better than the 4.5 billion US dollars (PS3.6 billion) expected by analysts and is likely to further fuel demands for a windfall tax. In response, BP unveiled plans alongside its quarterly figures to invest up to PS18 billion into the UK energy system by 2030. It pledged to invest in North Sea oil and gas, while driving down operational emissions, and said it is also working on a range of lower carbon energy projects in the UK, which are set to create jobs and develop new skills. In a further sign that it is seeking to head off criticism, BP also stressed it expects to pay up to PS1 billion in taxes for its 2022 North Sea profits, on top of around PS250 million paid annually in other UK taxes. Chief executive Bernard Looney insisted the group is 'backing Britain'. Boris Johnson today insisted he is honest and just got it 'wrong' over Partygate as he faces a huge blow in local elections with a poll suggesting the Tories are set to lose nearly 550 seats. The PM said he did his best to represent his beliefs 'faithfully and accurately' as he was interviewed by Susanna Reid on ITV's Good Morning Britain. A clearly uncomfortable Mr Johnson stressed that he 'inadvertently' misled Parliament over whether lockdown rules were breached in Downing Street, and had apologised since being fined by police. He said he had not received any other penalty notices yet but had 'no idea' whether that would change.  He also wriggled as he was grilled on how he was going to help people with the cost-of-living crisis, batting away calls for a windfall tax on energy firms reaping the benefits of soaring oil and gas prices. Mr Johnson conceded that inflation could hit 10 per cent in the coming months, and suggested there was 'more' the government could do - but declined to say what that might be.  The comments came as a shock survey found Labour is in line to gain more than 800 councillors in the contests on Thursday. Meanwhile, the Conservatives could see their numbers dive by 548 - in what would be a disastrous result for the PM as MPs mull a coup in the wake of the Partygate scandal.  It would be the worst Tory showing since Tony Blair was Labour leader, with flagship councils such as Wandsworth and Westminster on the line as well as Southampton and Thurrock.   The latest research for Electoral Calculus and Find Out Now interviewed 1,749 adults in the 201 councils holding ballots this week.  Asked on GMB if he is 'honest', Mr Johnson said: 'Yes. I think the best way to judge that is to look at what this Government says it's going to do and what it does.' He added: 'I do my best to represent faithfully and accurately what I believe, and sometimes it's controversial and sometimes it offends people, but that's what I do.' In response to a suggestion that some people believe he is a liar, Mr Johnson said: 'If you are talking about the statements I've made in the House of Commons, I was inadvertently... I was wrong and I've apologised for that.' The snapshot suggested Labour will end up holding 3,500 council seats compared to under 980 for the Conservatives.  The vote share of 24 per cent for the Tories and 39 per cent for Labour means the biggest advantage in local elections since the mid-1990s.  Martin Baxter, chief executive of Electoral Calculus, which conducted the survey with Find Out Now, told the Telegraph: 'The renewed partygate focus has made a poor situation for the Conservatives even worse by persuading even more Conservative supporters not to turn out at the local elections. 'The results could now be bad for Boris Johnson, especially if the Con servatives lose many hundreds of council seats and key flagship councils like Wandsworth or Westminster.' However, Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan denied that the results would be a verdict on Mr Johnson's premiership. She told Sky News: 'I think there are some places where there's some close fights but I think also in many places, certainly on doors I've been knocking on, there's been a continuing support at a local level.' She added: 'As ever with local councils' elections, we'll win some and we'll lose some, that's the nature of the beast anyway ... but what I think we will see is a really strong showing by Conservative voters who want to come out and demonstrate that they know that locally-run councils run by Conservatives are better.' Asked if the results would be seen as a referendum on the Prime Minister, she replied: 'No.' She added: 'As I say, 12 years into government you do get ... sometimes a protest vote and that's the beauty of democracy, that's one of the reasons we're supporting Ukraine as they fight to maintain their democratic right to be a free nation.' Local elections are taking place across the UK on May 5, with more than 4,000 council seats up for grabs in England. They include parts of the Red Wall such as Bury, as well as Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and all 32 London boroughs.  There have been claims that the Tories are facing an even worse outcome, losing up to 800 seats. But a narrower outcome could be tricky to interpret as many of the seats were last contested when the UK was still in the EU, Theresa May was in No10 and Labour was led by Jeremy Corbyn. Experts have pointed out that Labour had a very strong performance in 2018, suggesting the party could struggle to make further big gains - despite polls showing a national lead and massive advantage in London.    Although many of the issues that decide local elections remain the same - such as bin collections and services - they will inevitably be interpreted through the prism of Partygate in the wake of Mr Johnson's fine. Restive Conservatives have been holding off a decision on whether to mount a coup until the results come in, meaning the aftermath is likely to be the moment of maximum danger for the PM.  In a number of boroughs such as Wandsworth, Conservative candidates have been adding 'local' to ballot papers in an effort to offset the impact of Partygate.  Labour and the Lib Dems have been accused of giving each other clear runs in seats where they are taking on Conservatives. ",

Now, a new study led by the Newcastle University shows that they were in fact used for butchering and carving animal carcasses. By analysing Bronze Age daggers previously recovered from Pragatto, Italy, they found traces of animal residue suggestive of cutting 'bone, muscle and tendons'.  First appearing in the early 4th millennium BC, copper-alloy daggers were widespread in Bronze Age Europe including Britain and Ireland, but archaeologists have long debated what they were used for.  The Bronze Age is the third phase in the development of material culture among people of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.  The date at which the age began varied with regions; in Greece and China the Bronze Age began before 3000 BC, whereas in Britain it did not start until about 1900 BC. The Bronze Age, which marked the first time humans started to work with metal generally, came after the Stone Age and before the Iron Age.  Source: Encyclopaedia Britannica  'Metal daggers are widespread in Chalcolithic and Bronze Age Europe, yet their social and practical roles are still hotly debated,' researchers at Newcastle University say in their paper.  '[Our] method has proved successful in extracting and identifying animal residues located on cutting edges including bone, muscle, and tendons.  'These are interpreted as evidence of prehistoric carcass butchering and carving.'  As daggers are often found in weapon-rich male burials, or 'warrior graves', many researchers had speculated that they were primarily ceremonial objects used in prehistoric funerals to mark out the identity and status of the deceased.  Early metal daggers were long thought to be 'non-functional insignia of male identity and power' due to perceived weaknesses in their design and composition, previous studies have suggested.  Other academics had said that the objects may have been used as weapons or tools for crafts, based on the fact they show evidence of being sharpened.  However, previous studies in the last 50 years have been inconclusive due to a lack of a targeted method of analysis for copper-alloy metals, according to the Newcastle experts. Archaeologists working in the deserts of Oman uncovered an ancient stone board game in a Bronze Age settlement that was likely played some 4,000 years ago. Completed in December, the digs around Ayn Bani Sa'dah in the Qumayrah Valley were led by the University of Warsaw and Oman's Ministry of Heritage and Tourism. The game board, found buried within the remains of a room, sports at least thirteen marked squares, each with a central indentation. While its rules have been lost to time, if the Ayn Bani Sa'dah game was played like the Royal Game of Ur, its closest modern equivalent would be backgammon. Read more: Ancient stone board game found at Bronze Age settlement The new method performed what researchers say is the world's first extraction of organic residues from 10 excavated copper-alloy daggers. The daggers were excavated between 2016-2017 from Pragatto, a Bronze Age settlement site in northern Italy.  The project team, led by Dr Andrea Dolfini and Isabella Caricola, developed a technique that used picrosirius red (PSR) staining solution to stain organic residues on the daggers.  Biologists commonly use PSR to make collagen appear in various in tissue sections under cross-polarized light.  The residues were then observed under several types of optical, digital, and scanning electron microscopes.  This allowed the team to identify micro-residues of collagen and associated bone, muscle and bundle tendon fibres, as well as animal fur residues.  The Pragatto daggers had come into contact with multiple animal tissues and were used to process various types of animal carcasses, the team found.  Uses seem to have included the slaughtering of livestock, butchering carcasses and carving the meat from the bone. The team then carried out wide-ranging experiments with replicas of the daggers that had been created by an expert bronzesmith.  This showed that this type of dagger was well suited to processing animal carcasses.  Residues extracted from the experimental daggers were also analysed as part of the research and matched those observed on the archaeological daggers. 'The research has revealed that it is possible to extract and characterise organic residues from ancient metals, extending the range of materials that can be analysed in this way,' said Professor Andrea Dolfini at Newcastle University. 'This is a significant breakthrough as the new method enables the analysis of a wide variety of copper-alloy tools and weapons from anywhere in the world.  'The possibilities are endless, and so are the answers that the new method can and will provide in the future.' The fact people were buried with their daggers suggests they were important symbolically too. They were likely 'multi-functional implements'.  'Back in the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age, when daggers were placed in graves as a matter of course, I think they were also used as weapons and also as symbols of identity, e.g., gender, age, and perhaps status. But this cannot be demonstrated experimentally,' Professor Dolfini told MailOnline.  'By the later Bronze Age, swords would be the main weapons; daggers might perhaps have retained an ancillary function for close up combat (as they are sometimes still found in warrior graves), but I think we hit on the main non-martial use with our research.'  The study has been published in Scientific Reports.   The Bronze Age in Britain began around 2,500 BC and lasted for nearly 1,500 years. It was a time when sophisticated bronze tools, pots and weapons were brought over from continental Europe. Skulls uncovered from this period are vastly different from Stone Age skulls, which suggests this period of migration brought new ideas and new blood from overseas.  Bronze is made from 10 per cent tin and 90 per cent copper, both of which were in abundance at the time. Crete appears to be a centre of expansion for the bronze trade in Europe and weapons first came over from the Mycenaeans in southern Russia. It is widely believed bronze first came to Britain with the Beaker people who lived about 4,500 years ago in the temperate zones of Europe. They received their name from their distinctive bell-shaped beakers, decorated in horizontal zones by finely toothed stamps. The decorated pots are almost ubiquitous across Europe, and could have been used as drinking vessels or ceremonious urns. Believed to be originally from Spain, the Beaker folk soon spread into central and western Europe in their search for metals. Textile production was also under way at the time and people wore wrap-around skirts, tunics and cloaks. Men were generally clean-shaven and had long hair. The dead were cremated or buried in small cemeteries near settlements. This period was followed by the Iron Age which started around 650 BC and finished around 43 AD.",
  "463810ea3ce4551f21233cef2c9abdbb3f2009fb1b004901fe713923": "More than 7,000 migrants have crossed the Channel so far this year - treble last year's rate for the same period of time - as the Bank Holiday weekend saw a surge in journeys feared to have been caused by delays to Priti Patel's controversial Rwanda plan. The Ministry of Defence said that it had intercepted nearly 550 migrants in two days - 254 on Sunday and 293 yesterday - following an 11-day break in crossings. Critics said the break had simply been due to the poor weather, and insisted that the Home Secretary's Rwanda policy - under which illegal cross-Channel migrants will be sent 4,000 miles away to the east African state - would not act as a deterrent to those seeking to reach Britain.  But anxious Border Force officials have now suggested that further delays to the Rwanda scheme will only embolden migrants to attempt the dangerous voyage, warning that the Channel crisis could 'get worse before it gets better'. Tony Smith, a former director-general of the Border Force, said: 'If you can show people will fly from Manston [the Kent RAF base where they will be held] directly to Rwanda, that will hit the smuggling gangs and that will hit the migrants. At the moment, it seems a bit of a game of bluff. No one has been sent to Rwanda yet.' Last night, France claimed the Rwanda policy had actually created a window of opportunity that people-smugglers were exploiting.  Calais MP Pierre-Henri Dumont said there was evidence that criminals were encouraging migrants to attempt the crossing. 'From what I heard from the migrants, it seems that the news of the new legislation in the UK with Rwanda gives the smugglers the availability of new commercial arguments [to] the migrants to urge them to cross quickly for them not to be sent away because of this new legislation,' he added. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is said to have wanted the first flights of migrants on a one-way ticket to Rwanda to leave at the end of this month.  But government sources admitted last night that they were likely to be delayed by legal challenges being mounted by three different groups. Calais MP Pierre-Henri Dumont has admitted that the more than PS80million that Britain has given France to stop Channel migrant crossings the past two years is a waste of money. He said no amount of funding or manpower would stop migrants crossing the Channel and that the money being sent from the UK to France was only 'making both sides of the Channel angry'. In an interview with The Times in Calais, Mr Dumont said: 'I strongly believe that we need to exit the relationship that we have right now with the UK, which is basically the UK is giving us money to do the job, because it makes both sides of the Channel angry. 'The UK taxpayer because they say, 'We're giving money to the French, what are they doing, we still have crossings?' But we are not your b***h.  'We know that the migrants will continue to cross and at the end it will only make people on both sides of the Channel angry and unhappy because we think you're not giving enough money and you think you are giving us enough money and you don't see the results.' He said there was no prospect of France agreeing to take back migrants who had crossed the Channel.  Conservative MPs urged the Government to press ahead with the flights regardless. Tim Loughton told Radio 4's The World At One: 'It may seem a very robust, extreme scheme, but it is the first thing that has actually been put forward that would actually practically do something about this problem. 'People in the South and up and down the country are just sick and tired of these people smugglers making a fortune out of human trafficking, this misery coming across the Channel. 'The Rwanda scheme is an attempt to do something practical about it. But is very early days - it was only announced three weeks ago and it hasn't started yet.' Fellow Tory MP Andrew Bridgen added: 'The sooner people realise that it's not a hollow threat, the sooner the crossings will be reduced. 'The sooner flights start removing illegal entrants to Rwanda the sooner these economic migrants will stop placing themselves in the hands of the ruthless people traffickers and the sooner their exploitation will stop.'  The MoD said Sunday's crossings were made in seven small boats. Those brought ashore yesterday were put on coaches to be taken to the immigration processing centre at the former Manston airport near Ramsgate. Pictures showed large groups of mostly working-age men in life jackets and blankets. Several women and young children were with them. Channel migrants are still processed in the same was as before the Rwanda deal was announced, with most placed in hotels while their claims are processed. The MoD took over control of migrant operations in April, when the Government also announced controversial plans to send some of those making the cross-Channel journey to Rwanda. The Government's Nationality and Borders Bill - dubbed the anti-refugee Bill by campaigners as it makes it a criminal offence to knowingly arrive in the UK illegally and includes powers to process asylum seekers overseas - became law on Thursday. Mr Johnson has said tens of thousands could be sent to Africa under the PS120million deal, which will let them apply for asylum there.  But refugee organisations said the Bill does 'nothing to address the reasons people come', with one charity saying the majority of migrants it spoke to said the plan will not put them off crossing to the UK.  The Care4Calais charity said a survey of 64 migrants found 87 per cent had heard of the plan and 75 per cent said 'it won't put them off crossing to the UK'. A spokesman added: 'They have no choice: they've fled danger made long, dangerous journeys'. The charity branded the Rwanda deal - which Miss Patel has described as a 'world-first' agreement - as 'just another in a long line of deterrence policies announced by this Government over the last few years'. Care4Calais said: 'Refugees have escaped from the worst horrors in this world. When you're risking your life, what else do you have to lose? When someone explains 'even death wouldn't stop me' trying to get to the UK, it's clear that even the threat of Rwanda won't change anything.' Enver Solomon, chief executive of Refugee Council, said the resumption of crossings at the weekend showed that 'draconian policies enshrined in the Nationality and Borders Bill and their (the Government's) Rwanda deal are doing little to deter desperate people jumping on boats because they do nothing to address the reasons people come'. He called on the UK to have a 'grown-up conversation with France and the EU about sharing responsibility'. He said: 'We need a fair and humane asylum system, with means well thought-out, long-term solutions that address why people are forced from their homes, and provides them with safe routes to the UK.' Sunday's figures mean at least 6,947 people have reached the UK since the start of the year after navigating busy shipping lanes from France in small boats, according to data compiled by the PA news agency. That is more than three times the amount recorded by this time last year (2,004) and over six times the figure for the same period in 2020 (1,006). Typically there can be periods of several days or weeks without migrant crossings, often depending on weather conditions. Two longer gaps of 16 and 13 days without crossings were recorded earlier this year, before the Rwanda deal was announced. The longest period without any crossings so far in 2022 was 16 days, between January 27 and February 11, PA analysis of Government figures shows. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said there needs to be 'an international co-ordinated criminal response' to tackle the 'criminal gangs' that he said are driving the migrant crisis. Speaking on the campaign trail in Worthing, West Sussex, he said: 'I know what can be done if you've got teams working together across Europe all the way along those routes, absolutely bearing down on these criminal gangs, and working very closely with the French authorities as well.'",
  "ca33408b279f21c8e30297dc4a7462c9409dc7d8ce90ecae2b7d0b06": "Boris Becker's girlfriend has been spotted for the first time today since the disgraced tennis star was handed a two-and-a-half-year jail sentence for flouting the terms of his bankruptcy.  Lilian de Carvalho Monteiro, who is in her forties, was seen yesterday walking down a street in London with a female companion, who was holding a baby.  The political risk analyst, who wore a long black jacket and blue jeans, looked glum as she took turns pushing the child's pram.   London-based Lilian started dating the three-time Wimbledon champion in the summer of 2020 after he split with his ex-wife Lilly in 2018 following nine years of marriage.  She has three degrees, including a masters in African studies from the School of Oriental and African Studies, and speaks five languages, including German, according to German newspaper Bild.  Lilian was born in the African island state of Sao Tome and Principe and is the daughter of Victor Monteiro, the republic's former Minister of Defence who ran for the presidency in 2014. She spent much of her youth in Rome where she attended a private school before studying at the University of La Sapienza, before coming to London to study at the School of Oriental and African Studies, where she earned her master's degree at the age of 25. After arriving in the capital she met father-of-four Boris Becker - who had been married twice before, to Lilly between 2009 and 2018, and Barbara Becker from 1993 to 2001.  Lilian and Becker were reported to have linked in June 2020, before they spent time together in London as well as being seen in Dubai back in January 2021 during the third UK lockdown. In the summer of 2021, the couple were seen kissing and enjoying the warm weather on a boat trip in Ibiza. This year, Lilian has been a constant presence by Becker's side while attending court hearings, in which he was initially accused and later found guilty of hiding PS2.5million worth of assets and loans to avoid paying his debts. Lilian was seen attending Southwark Court Court alongside Becker and even blew him a goodbye kiss after he was jailed for two and a half years and blasted by a judge for showing no remorse. Becker, 54, was declared bankrupt in June 2017, owing creditors almost PS50million over an unpaid loan of more than PS3million on his estate in Mallorca, Spain.  The BBC pundit transferred around PS390,000 from his business account to others, including those of his ex-wife Barbara Becker and estranged wife Sharlely 'Lilly' Becker. He also failed to declare his share in a PS1million property in his home town of Leimen, Germany, hid a bank loan of almost PS700,000 - worth PS1.1million with interest - and concealed 75,000 shares in a tech firm, valued at PS66,000. Becker - who got a two-year suspended sentence for tax evasion and attempted tax evasion worth PS1.4million in Germany in 2002 - was found guilty on April 8 of four Insolvency Act offences between June and October 2017. As he was led away, Becker was red-faced and appeared to struggle with his overnight bag. Lilian blew him a kiss before he disappeared out of the court to the cells below.  Becker had earlier arrived at court with Lilian, dressed smartly in a suit and wearing a Wimbledon tie as he walked up the steps and into the building while holding hands with her. He then entered the dock of the court, while his eldest son came into the courtroom carrying a large Puma-branded bag, which the tennis star had previously been seen carrying outside his home.  After Becker was sentenced, former British number one tennis player Andrew Castle said he felt sorry for Lilian.  Few sports stars have ever hit the height of Boris Becker's tennis careers - and none as young as the German ace. Born in Leimen, West Germany, in 1967, Becker, the son of an architect father and a Czech immigrant mother, was thrust into the world of tennis from a young age. His father founded a tennis centre in the town, where Becker honed his skills early on. By the age of 10, in 1977, he was a member of the junior team of the Baden Tennis Association. He went on to win the South German championship and the first German Youth Tennis Tournament.  After winning funding for training from the German Tennis Federation, he turned professional at 16 in 1984, winning the Tennis World Young Masters at the NEC in Birmingham in 1985, before claiming victory at Queens in June. Two weeks later, in July, aged 17, he entered Wimbledon as an unseeded player and took the tournament by storm, beating Kevin Curren by four sets in the final.  At just 17 years and 228 days old he became the youngest men's singles champion at SW19 - and immediately became a household name. The following year he defend his title, beating then world number one Ivan Lendl to secure back-to-back Wimbledon titles. He appeared in 77 finals and won 49 singles titles during his 16 years as a tennis pro. But by 1993, facing criticism over his marriage to wife Barbara and tax problems with the German government, had caused Becker to slide into a severe mid-career decline. In 1997, Becker lost to Sampras in the quarterfinals at Wimbledon. After that match, he vowed that he would never play at Wimbledon again. However he returned one more time to the prestigious west London tennis club, in 1999, this time losing in the fourth round to Patrick Rafter. Off the court, his personal troubles continued. He had to pay PS2.4million after he fathered a daughter, named Anna, with a Russian model while married to wife Barbara. That incident took place after he crashed out of Wimbledon to Rafter in 1999 and decided to retire from the sport, aged 31. Becker, in his 2003 autobiography, Stay A Moment Longer, revealed how he 'cried my eyes out' and felt the need to go out for a few beers with friends. However his then wife Barbara, seven months' pregnant with their second son, wanted him to stay at their hotel with her.  'She couldn't and wouldn't understand that she suddenly wasn't first in my priorities,' said Becker.  'I said, 'Just once more with the lads, Barbara, just once more to say farewell and then it's only you'. That didn't work. We rowed for two whole hours. Suddenly she was in pain and decided to check into hospital.; Becker said he told his wife to call him if the baby was really on the way, then hit the town. By 11pm he was at the bar in Mayfair's Nobu and spotted Russian model Angela Ermakowa. The pair had sex on the staircase in the London outpost.  The following February his secretary handed him a fax in his Munich office. It read: 'Dear Herr Becker, We met in Nobu in London. The result of that meeting is now eight months old.'  He later split from his first wife Barbara Feltus, a divorce which is estimated to have cost him more than PS15million, as well as their home in Miami.  Becker found a new post-tennis purpose soon after, joining the BBC for its annual coverage of Wimbledon - to great success. But his personal problems continued. He had a short engagement to Alessandra Meyer-Wolden in 2008, before announcing that he and Dutch model Sharlely 'Lilly' Kerssenberg would marry in 2009. After nine years of marriage, and a child, Becker's fourth, the pair split in 2018.  A year earlier, Becker had been declared bankrupt in June 2017 over an unpaid loan of more than PS3million on his estate in Mallorca, Spain. His former business partner, Hans-Dieter Cleven, also claimed that the former tennis ace owed him more than PS30million - though the case that was rejected by a Swiss court.",

The road had to be closed in both directions on Sunday, while emergency services attended the scene. Initially another person involved in the crash, who they thought may have been seriously injured, left the scene and was being searched for by the police - but they have now been located. The crash happened on the B3274 just after 1.30am. Police are carrying out enquiries to identify the victims and locate their next of kin. The emergency services sealed off the road for hours and called it a 'critical incident' at the time. Now they have confirmed the deaths and officers from the Serious Collision Investigation Team are investigating the circumstances surrounding the crash. Police have not stated if the victims are male or female or their ages. Four people have been killed over the Bank Holiday in the Devon and Cornwall area - after a pedestrian was killed in a hit and run in Torquay, Devon. A woman has since been arrested. Last week a family paid tribute after Paul Parker, aged 63, and Pamela Osborne, aged 69, died in a traffic accident in Bude, Cornwall on April 18. They were travelling on a motorbike which was involved in a collision with a van on the A39. The couple sustained critical injuries and, sadly, died at the scene. Paying tribute to Pamela Osborne, her family said: 'Our mum; so loving, caring, and thoughtful. She thought the world of all her family; she was a great mum, nan and great nan and always tried to make the most of her later years of life with her partner Paul, doing what they both loved - anything to do with bikes.' The family of Paul Parker also paid tribute to him, saying: 'Dad was a larger-than-life character. He would always stop for a chat with anyone, and this would normally end in plenty of laughter too. During his action-packed life, he competed in many forms of motor sports; on two and four wheels, took to the air and travelled the world.'",
  "da4a20d9c7991e68cefb30f282d898fa6bf4f3e9286f6ac12b9538c2": "Helen Skelton's husband Richie Myler has begun a new relationship with the daughter of the multi-millionaire President of the Leeds Rhinos club he plays for, MailOnline can reveal. Heartbroken Countryfile presenter Helen, 38, feels 'bewildered' by the breakdown of her marriage to Richie, 31, who is believed to be living with his new partner, Stephanie Thirkill, 32.  Helen and Richie's split came just four months after the arrival of the couple's third child, a baby daughter. A source close to the couple told MailOnline: 'Helen is absolutely devastated. Now she is contemplating life without him while he has moved on with his new partner. 'Richie is insisting there was no crossover, that he began the romance with Stephanie after their marriage collapsed, but Helen feels let down. They are still married, and their baby is literally four months old. 'She thought their marriage was safe and secure and is totally shocked by what's happened.' Ms Thirkill is the daughter of Andrew Thirkill, who is one of the richest businessmen in Leeds and is worth an estimated PS175 million.  In 2019, the lifelong Leeds Rhinos fan, who attended his first match in 1968, became President of the club. Richie plays scrumhalf for the leading rugby league club, who he joined in 2017 and also represents England at international level. Former Blue Peter star Helen confirmed their breakup on Instagram last week, writing: 'Very sad to say that Richie and I are no longer a couple. 'He has left the family home. We will be doing our best to co-parent our small children.' She added two broken heart emojis to the post shared on Monday evening with her 278K followers. 'Helen's holding it together well, which is admirable given she was blindsided by his new relationship.' The source added: 'Mutual friends think he's treated her appallingly.' The new woman in Richie's life, Ms Thirkill is listed as a director of two companies run by her father; Age Partnership and Advise Wise which are among a group of businesses he established to help build his considerable fortune. She previously studied Retail Marketing Management at Leeds Metropolitan University and on a day-to-day basis, works as Marketing Executive at Age Partnership. In 2018, she married in a lavish ceremony at Bolton Abbey, the Yorkshire estate of the Duke of Devonshire. It is believed the couple have now separated. Helen married Richie in December 2013, and the pair have three children together. Until the announcement of the break-up, they appeared to the outside world to have the perfect marriage, with many expressions of their devotion on social media in recent weeks. The couple bought a PS550,000 cottage on the edge of Leeds during lockdown two years ago and have spent hundreds of thousands renovating it with a beautifully appointed kitchen and huge French windows overlooking the idyllic garden. Like her father, Ms Thirkill is an ardent Rugby League fan and regularly attends Leeds Rhinos matches, where she is believed to have met Richie. Mr Thirkill, 62, was born in the Leeds working class district of Meanwood and has enjoyed a phenomenal rags to riches rise, which has made him one of the leading figures in the Yorkshire business community who also appears on The Sunday Times Rich List. He is also well known for his philanthropic ventures. He lives in Harrogate, North Yorkshire on an exclusive estate, where homes easily cost in excess of PS1 million, with his wife Jill.  The couple also have a son, Jonathan, 29 who runs his own customer experience company and is also considered a successful businessman. Mr Thirkill senior started working life as an apprentice brick layer in 1976, after leaving Leeds Central High School. He once admitted in a media interview: 'I wasn't particularly bright. I wasn't thick but I wasn't interested in school. It was just a place to meet people, have a good time and play football. I couldn't see the point of it all and just wanted to get out and make money.' After realising that he did not want to work on building sites, because of harsh winters, he then got a job as a filing clerk for two years before moving to the Yorkshire Post newspaper as a trainee sales rep. In April 1981, Mr Thirkill left to start up his own advertising agency, which became such a success that he sold it in 1988 for PS2.7 million. He then launched a number of other businesses before eventually starting Age Partnership in 2004, which significantly increased his wealth. The company specialises in equity release for homeowners aged over 55 and is the largest provider of this service in the country. Mr Thirkill once revealed that he came up with the idea after watching his mother struggle to release equity from her home because of bureaucracy and high interest rates. In addition to his business success, he is widely praised for his charitable work with the Leeds Rhinos Foundation, which runs programmes for disabled, isolated and disadvantaged people. He is also involved in sponsoring Jamaica's rugby league team as a way of maintaining contacts with the sizeable Jamaican community in Leeds.",
  "0df66d147ecebcd87fd8d31a3369f3809f18bdc1a44f7aab2067e599": "The US Supreme Court looks set to overturn a landmark ruling that effectively legalised abortions across America, handing the power to decide whether or not to permit the procedure back to individual states.   A draft legal opinion, which was leaked to Politico, reveals a majority of the court's nine judges are in agreement on the issue which would be enough to force a change in the law - though their decision is not final until the ruling is officially published. In the document, Justice Samuel Alito writes that Roe v Wade - the 1973 Supreme Court ruling which found that excessive state regulation of abortion is unconstitutional - was 'egregiously wrong from the start' and 'must be overruled'. If the ruling is overturned, it would give individual states the power to decide on whether to ban abortion. The Guttmacher Institute, a pro-choice research group, has said that 26 states are 'certain or likely' to ban abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned.  Alito, who was nominated to the court in 2006 by George W Bush, also takes aim at another 1992 case - Planned Parenthood v. Casey - which upheld Roe's findings. He argues that Roe's 'reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. Far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division.' But there were few signs that the new ruling will do anything to heal those divisions, with protesters gathering outside the court in Washington DC last night. Politico reports that, aside from Alito, four other judges voted in favour of overturning the law: Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, all of whom were nominated by Republican presidents. Partisan fighting over the issue began almost immediately, with Democrats vowing to defend abortion rights while Republicans demanded a probe into the leak.  If the leak proves to be genuine - and the Supreme Court has not denied that it is - it would mark the first time that a draft opinion has ever appeared in public before being officially published, a move expected within the next two months.  A decision in the case had been expected before the court begins its summer recess in late June or early July, so it could be more than a month before the court actually issues a final opinion. If the court does what the draft suggests, the ruling would upend a nearly 50-year-old decision; its advance publication would also disturb an almost unbroken tradition of secrecy at the court. Key points emerging from the Roe vs Wade legal opinion The Roe v. Wade decision nearly 50 years ago recognised that the right to personal privacy under the US Constitution protects a woman's ability to terminate her pregnancy. On January 22, 1973, the Supreme Court decided that the constitutional right to privacy applied to abortion. Roe was 'Jane Roe,' a pseudonym for Norma McCorvey, a single mother pregnant for the third time, who wanted an abortion. She sued the Dallas attorney general Henry Wade over a Texas law that made it a crime to terminate a pregnancy except in cases of rape or incest, or when the mother's life was in danger. Roe's lawyers said she was unable to travel out of the state to obtain an abortion and argued that the law was too vague and infringed on her constitutional rights. Filing a complaint alongside her was Texas doctor James Hallford, who argued the law's medical provision was vague, and that he was unable to reliably determine which of his patients fell into the allowed category. The 'Does', another couple who were childless, also filed a companion complaint, saying that medical risks made it unsafe but not life-threatening for the wife to carry a pregnancy to term, and arguing they should be able to obtain a safe, legal abortion should she become pregnant. The trio of complaints - from a woman who wanted an abortion, a doctor who wanted to perform them and a non-pregnant woman who wanted the right if the need arose - ultimately reached the nation's top court. The court heard arguments twice, and then waited until after Republican president Richard Nixon's re-election, in November 1972. Only the following January did it offer its historic seven-to-two decision - overturning the Texas laws and setting a legal precedent that has had ramifications in all 50 states. A spokesperson for the Supreme Court said: 'The Court has no comment.'  Politico executive editor Dafna Linzer sent a note to staff after the story posted, expressing confidence in the story and their verification of the draft opinion. 'After an extensive review process, we are confident of the authenticity of the draft. ... We take our responsibilities to our readers with the greatest seriousness,' she noted.  Politico posted the entire draft opinion online.  If the Alito decision is adopted, it would return the issue of abortions to the states and over half are likely to ban abortion. Numerous Republican-led states have passed various abortion restrictions in defiance of the Roe precedent in recent years. Republicans could try to enact a nationwide abortion ban, while Democrats could also seek to protect abortion rights at the national level. Twenty-six states are certain or likely to ban abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned, according to the pro-abortion rights think tank the Guttmacher Institute. Of those, 22 states already have total or near-total bans on the books that are currently blocked by Roe, aside from Texas. The state's law banning it after six weeks has already been allowed to go into effect by the Supreme Court due to its unusual civil enforcement structure. Four more states are considered likely to quickly pass bans if Roe is overturned. Sixteen states and the District of Columbia, meanwhile, have protected access to abortion in state law. This year, anticipating a decision overturning or gutting Roe, eight conservative states have already moved to restrict abortion rights. Oklahoma, for example, passed several bills in recent weeks, including one that goes into effect this summer making it a felony to perform an abortion. Just hours after the stunning leak of draft opinion emerged, hundreds of pro-choice and anti-abortion activists gathered in front of the US Supreme Court on Monday night. Squaring off on either side of the white marble building a stone's throw from the Capitol, the pro-choice and anti-abortion groups railed at each other. 'Roe v. Wade is going to go,' anti-abortion protesters taunted, while the pro-choice crowd yelled: 'My body, my choice.' The two groups chanted and waved placards in the plaza in front of the steps to the Supreme Court, with barriers and a few uniformed police officers barring access to the colonnaded building. Abby Korb, a 23-year-old graduate student and congressional aide, said she was 'in literal shock' when the news broke and quickly headed to the Supreme Court with a friend. 'I'm a woman and my rights are being taken away every single day,' she said. Like many others at the spontaneous demonstration, Korb, originally from Wisconsin, is now calling for legislation at the federal level to protect access to abortion. 'We need access to safe abortion because making it illegal isn't going to stop it, it's just going to make it more dangerous,' she said. The growing crowd took turns to hurl expletives at Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, who reportedly wrote the opinion, and called on Democratic Party leaders to 'do something'. Madeline Hren, a 25-year-old from North Carolina, said she was very angry. 'I called everyone I knew to be very angry,' she said, holding a small sign with a drawing of a bloody coat hanger that said 'We will not go back.' 'I'm really upset about it... I didn't cry. I'm mostly just mad,' said Hren, who works for the UN Foundation. She now fears that an abortion ban will extend to her native North Carolina. For opponents of the right to abortion, however, it was time to celebrate. 'You don't care if people die,' they sang at the pro-choice crowd. 'I hope they overturn it,' said Claire Rowan, a 55-year-old mother of seven children, some of whom accompanied her to the demonstration. Rowan said she hopes people will now be 'asking God for forgiveness so that the nation can heal.' Politico reports that four of the five remaining Republican-appointed justices voted with Alito in December, after hearing oral arguments on a Mississippi abortion case. And that line-up remains unchanged as of this week. Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett all voted to strike down Roe.  Democrat-appointed justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan are working on dissents.  It is not clear how Chief Justice John Roberts, nominated by W Bush, voted - though the fact that he did not pen the majority opinion could suggest he voted against. Sources told CNN that he would've dissented with the liberals on Alito's opinion draft.  But if the justices stand firm, it would not matter how Roberts votes as five back the Alito draft opinion. Draft opinions can change and the ruling will not be final until it is published. If the Alito draft is adopted, it would rule in favor of Mississippi in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization - a case involving the state's  attempt to ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.  More than half of all US states have some kind of abortion ban law likely to take effect if Roe v Wade is overturned by the United States Supreme Court.  According to the pro-reproductive rights group The Guttmacher Institute, there are 26 states that will likely make abortions illegal if the Supreme Court overturns the landmark 1973 ruling. 18 have existing abortion bans that have previously been ruled unconstitutional, four have time limit bans and four are likely to pass laws if Roe v Wade is overturned, the organization found. The 18 states that have near-total bans on abortion already on the books are Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.  In addition, Georgia, Iowa, Ohio, and South Carolina all have laws that ban abortions after the six-week mark.  Florida, Indiana, Montana and Nebraska, are likely to pass bills when Roe v Wade is overturned, the Guttmacher Institute said. Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas, West Virginia and Wisconsin's bans all have pre-Roe v Wade laws that became unenforceable after the Supreme Court's 1973 decision - that would kick into effect if the federal legal precedent established in Roe were overturned. Arkansas, Oklahoma, Mississippi and Texas have further bans that will come into effect if the law was overturned. These were passed post-Roe v Wade. They're joined by Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah and Wyoming, in passing such laws.  The states that will limit abortions based on the length of time a patient has been pregnant are Arkansas, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, North Dakota and Ohio. There are four states that have laws that state abortion is not a constitutionally protected right: Alabama, Louisiana, Texas and West Virginia.  If the US Supreme Court votes to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision that legalised abortion nationwide, conservative states will have more confidence that their new limits on abortion will stand while liberal states will feel more urgency to protect and expand abortion rights. Here are some restrictions and protections state legislatures have taken up in 2022: ABORTION RESTRICTIONS ABORTION PROTECTIONS   The draft opinion runs 98 pages, including a 31-page appendix of historical state abortion laws, Politico notes in its report. The document is replete with citations to previous court decisions, books and other authorities, and includes 118 footnotes. The appearances and timing of this draft are consistent with court practice.  Politico said only that it received 'a copy of the draft opinion from a person familiar with the court's proceedings in the Mississippi case along with other details supporting the authenticity of the document.'  Katyal described how the Supreme Court handles its decision making process. 'After oral argument the Justices take a tentative vote. This would have happened in December. The senior most justice in the majority gets to assign the opinion. That might have been Roberts, but doubtful since Alito wrote this draft,' he noted on Twitter. 'Now, once the draft is circulated, the justices in dissent will write an opinion. That's presumably happening now. But the tenative vote seems strong, and Chief Justice Roberts is irrelevant if the 4 + Alito hold with their tentative votes,' he added.  The unprecedented leak has likely shaken the Supreme Court to its core.  Barricades were being posted around the building shortly after the report was posted online. Posts to social media showed people gathering at the metal fencing, holding candles in vigil.  The hightly-respected SCOTUSblog, which covers the court in-depth, noted: 'The document leaked to Politico is almost certainly an authentic draft opinion by J. Alito that reflects what he believes at least 5 members of the Court have voted to support -- overruling Roe. But as Alito's draft, it does not reflect the comments or reactions of other Justices.' 'It's impossible to overstate the earthquake this will cause inside the Court, in terms of the destruction of trust among the Justices and staff. This leak is the gravest, most unforgivable sin,' SCOTUSblog tweeted.  Other observers called it a crisis for Roberts' tenure as chief justice. 'The article represents the greatest crisis that Chief Justice John Roberts has faced in his tenure on the Court,' wrote legal scholar Jonathan Turley. Turley also pointed out the leak happened to put pressure on the court to change its ruling before it's publicly announced.  'The most likely motivation is obviously to pressure the Court and push the legislation in Congress on a federal abortion law before the midterm elections. It will also likely renew the call for court packing,' he added.  And Democratic campaign stratgist Brian Fallon tweeted: 'Is a brave clerk taking this unpredecented step of leaking a draft opinion to warn the country what's coming in a last-ditch Hail Mary attempt to see if the public response might cause the Court to reconsider?'  Such a ruling would immediately become an issue in the 2022 midterm election where Democrats are struggling to keep control of Congress.  Abortion would also become a major political issue in governors' races with states being given the right to determine whether or not to allow the procedure.   Both sides of the political aisle immediately jumped on the report with Democrats outraged and Republicans praising the news. 'Abortion care is a fundamental human right and we must legislation like it,' wrote progressive Rep.. Ayanna Pressly of Massachusetts on Twitter.  'This is bulls***,' wrote Democratic Senator Tina Smith of Minnesota on Twitter.   'Our daughters, sisters, mothers, and grandmothers will not be silenced. The world is about to hear their fury. California will not sit back. We are going to fight like hell,' wrote Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California.  'The Supreme Court is preparing to overturn Roe - the most significant and glorious news of our lifetime. Join me in praying to God for the right outcome. Life begins at conception. Let's protect it,' tweeted conservative Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia. Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida claimed the leak was done to influence the ruling. 'The next time you hear the far left preaching about how they are fighting to preserve our Republic's institutions & norms remember how they leaked a Supreme Court opinion in an attempt to intimidate the justices on abortion,' he wrote on Twitter.  And Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas called for an investigation of the leak. 'The Supreme Court & the DOJ must get to the bottom of this leak immediately using every investigative tool necessary,' he tweeted.   The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, in September, passed legislation that would codify abortion rights protections amid threats to Roe v. Wade. That bill has been stalled in the 50-50 Senate, where it needs at least 60 votes to move forward. And it may need more than that as not all Democratic senators are guaranteed to vote for such a bill, particularly moderate Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Progressive Senator Bernie Sanders said that 60-vote thresh hold, often called the filibuster, must be removed to legalize abortion. 'Congress must pass legislation that codifies Roe v. Wade as the law of the land in this country NOW. And if there aren't 60 votes in the Senate to do it, and there are not, we must end the filibuster to pass it with 50 votes,' he tweeted on Monday night.  Democrats SLAM Supreme Court's draft decision overturning Roe v. Wade - as Republicans celebrate  Following the news that Justice Samuel Alito penned a draft opinion in February repudiating both Roe vs. Wade and the 1992 Planned Parenthood vs. Casey decision, prominent Democrats have vowed to fight it. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders demanded Congress pass legislation that codifies abortion rights into law - and potentially end the filibuster to pass that bill, while Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren branded the Supreme Court as 'extremist.' Several Democratic governors, like New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, also vowed to protect abortion rights in their state, with Hochul writing: 'I refuse to let my new granddaughter have to fight for the rights that generations have fought for and won.' Meanwhile, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy dubbed it a 'truly dark day in America,' and California Gov. Gavin Newsom vowed to 'fight like hell. 'Our daughters, sisters, mothers and grandmothers will not be silenced,' he tweeted. Feminist attorney Gloria Allred wrote: 'If the leaked draft opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade becomes the final opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court, then countless women and girls will die or be maimed from illegal, unsafe abortions. Urge SCOTUS to support Roe v. Wade and stop endangering women.' Republicans, though, seemed excited by the news - but still remained wary of the decision to leak the draft decision. Sen. Josh Hawley wrote that the leak of Alito's decision was 'an unprecedented breach of confidentiality, clearly meant to intimidate. 'The Justices mustn't give in to this attempt to corrupt the process,' he wrote, urging them to 'stay strong.' Florida Sen. Marco Rubio also questioned the motives behind the leak, writing Monday night: 'The next time you hear the far left preaching about how they are fighting to preserve our Republic's institutions and norms, remember how they leaked a Supreme Court opinion in an attempt to intimidate.' And controversial North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn asked for prayers for the end of Roe v. Wade, writing: 'Evil MUST not triumph. 'Science, common sense and LIFE will win.'  Roe vs Wade: The Texas mother who won the landmark 1973 case but then became a fierce opponent of abortion rights - and her 'Roe Baby' daughter who finally revealed her identity last year ByStephen M. Lepore For Dailymail.Com The Supreme Court has voted to strike down Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that legalized abortion in the United States, a bombshell report revealed on Monday. The history of the legislation, which has proved controversial since it was made in 1973, dates back half a century. The case was filed in 1971 by Norma McCorvey, a 22-year-old living in Texas who was unmarried and seeking a termination of her unwanted pregnancy.  She married at the age of 16, but separated shortly after while she was pregnant. She gave custody of her daughter to her mother.  She gave a second child up for adoption, but when she got pregnant a third time she decided to have an abortion.  She said she couldn't afford to travel to one of the handful of states where it would have been legal. Because of state legislation preventing abortions unless the mother's life is at risk, she was unable to undergo the procedure in a safe and legal environment. So McCorvey sued Henry Wade, the Dallas county district attorney, in 1970. The case went on to the Supreme Court, under the filing Roe vs Wade, to protect McCorvey's privacy. Sarah Weddington and  a former classmate, Linda Coffee, brought a class-action lawsuit on behalf of a pregnant woman challenging a state law that largely banned abortions. She had been among only five women out of a class of 1,600 to graduate with a law degree from the University of Texas in 1967.  The Supreme Court handed down the watershed 7-2 decision that a woman's right to make her own medical decisions, including the choice to have an abortion, is protected under the 14th Amendment.  In particular, that the Due Process Clause of the the 14th Amendment provides a fundamental 'right to privacy' that protects a woman's liberty to choose whether or not to have an abortion. The landmark ruling saw abortions decriminalized in 46 states, but under certain specific conditions which individual states could decide on. For example, states could decide whether abortions were allowed only during the first and second trimester but not the third (typically beyond 28 weeks).  Among pro-choice campaigners, the decision was hailed as a victory which would mean fewer women would become seriously - or even fatally - ill from abortions carried out by unqualified or unlicensed practitioners. Moreover, the freedom of choice was considered a significant step in the equality fight for women in the country. Victims of rape or incest would be able to have the pregnancy terminated and not feel coerced into motherhood. However, pro-lifers contended it was tantamount to murder and that every life, no matter how it was conceived, is precious. Though the decision has never been overturned, anti-abortionists have prompted hundreds of states laws since then narrowing the scope of the ruling. Following the ruling, McCorvey lived a quiet life until the 1980s when she revealed herself to be Jane Roe. McCorvey became a leading, outspoken pro-abortion voice in American discourse, even working at a women's clinic where abortions were performed. However,  she performed an unlikely U-turn in 1995, becoming a born-again Christian and began traveling the country speaking out against the procedure. In 2003, a she filed a motion to overturn her original 1973 ruling with the U.S. district court in Dallas. The motion moved through the courts until it was ultimately denied by the Supreme Court in 2005. McCorvey died at an assisted living home in Texas in February 2017, aged 69. She admitted before she died that she made the change in exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars. This is my deathbed confession,' she says. 'I took their money and they took me out in front of the cameras and told me what to say. That's what I'd say.'  In the interview, McCorvey refers to herself as 'the Big Fish' in the eyes of evangelical leaders who were eager to have her publicly switch sides and take up their cause.  In addressing her activism for the religious right, McCorvey boasts: 'I'm a good actress.' Shelley Lynn Thornton, now 51, is the biological daughter of Norma McCorvey and spoke on the record for the first time in 2021. Shelley appeared on Good Morning America for her first ever TV interview. Her identity was only made public in September by The Atlantic.   'A lot of people didn't know I existed,' she said, adding she fears the world blames her for abortion being legal.  'It doesn't revolve around me, I wasn't the one who created this law. I'm not the one who created this movement. I had nothing to do with it. I was just a little itty-bitty thing and, you know, circumstances prevailed.  'My whole thinking is that, 'oh God everybody is going to hate me because everyone is going to blame me for abortion being legal,' she said.  Thornton, who never met her birth mother in person before her death in 2017, told journalist Joshua Prager she had decided to speak out after more than half a century because she wanted to free herself from the 'secrets and lies.' 'Secrets and lies are, like, the two worst things in the whole world. I'm keeping a secret, but I hate it,' she said, in an adapted excerpt from Prager's new book 'The Family Roe: An American Story', published in The Atlantic.   'I want everyone to understand that this is something I've chosen to do.'   Politico reported Monday night that Justice Samuel Alito, one of six justices appointed by Republican presidents on the nine-member court, wrote a majority draft opinion in February repudiating both Roe and the 1992 Planned Parenthood vs. Casey decision. 'Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,' Alito writes in the opinion, which was reportedly circulated among the court members. 'We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled,' he continues in the document, titled 'Opinion of the Court.' 'It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected representatives.' The news sent shock waves throughout Washington D.C. with Democrats vowing to codify the legal right to an abortion into law and Republicans celebrating the news.  Politico noted that this is the first such case in modern history of a Supreme Court draft decision being leaked to the public while the case was still pending. The draft document is not final until the court formally announces its decision in a case, meaning the ruling could still be changed. The court is expected to issue its final ruling before its term is up in late June or early July.  In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court recognized a woman's constitutional right to an abortion in Roe v. Wade. The landmark ruling legalized abortion nationwide but divided public opinion and has been under attack ever since.  The case was filed in 1971 by Norma McCorvey, a 22-year-old living in Texas who was unmarried and seeking a termination of her unwanted pregnancy.  Because of state legislation preventing abortions unless the mother's life is at risk, she was unable to undergo the procedure in a safe and legal environment. So McCorvey sued Henry Wade, the Dallas county district attorney, in 1970. The case went on to the Supreme Court, under the filing Roe vs Wade, to protect McCorvey's privacy.

For example, states could decide whether abortions were allowed only during the first and second trimester but not the third (typically beyond 28 weeks).  Impact  Among pro-choice campaigners, the decision was hailed as a victory which would mean fewer women would become seriously - or even fatally - ill from abortions carried out by unqualified or unlicensed practitioners. Moreover, the freedom of choice was considered a significant step in the equality fight for women in the country. Victims of rape or incest would be able to have the pregnancy terminated and not feel coerced into motherhood. However, pro-lifers contended it was tantamount to murder and that every life, no matter how it was conceived, is precious. Though the decision has never been overturned, anti-abortionists have prompted hundreds of states laws since then narrowing the scope of the ruling. One such was the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act signed by President George W. Bush in 2003, which banned a procedure used to perform second-trimester abortions.    Norma McCorvey (Jane Roe) Following the ruling, McCorvey lived a quiet life until the 1980s when she revealed herself to be Jane Roe. McCorvey became a leading, outspoken pro-abortion voice in American discourse, even working at a women's clinic where abortions were performed. However,  she performed an unlikely U-turn in 1995, becoming a born again Christian and began traveling the country speaking out against the procedure. In 2003, a she filed a motion to overturn her original 1973 ruling with the U.S. district court in Dallas. The motion moved through the courts until it was ultimately denied by the Supreme Court in 2005. McCorvey died at an assisted living home in Texas in February 2017, aged 69. ",
  "9aa31115291800aa5bc8d5faa71aebd976eca1eda5ae1f81a7c711d1": "Nicola Sturgeon has declined to define what a woman is, saying it would 'oversimplify' the debate over gender reform and could harm trans people. The Scottish National Party leader yesterday angered female rights groups by refusing a definition in an interview ahead of the local elections. She said: 'I'm not going to, I'm just not going to get into this debate at a level that's about simplified and lurid headlines. Trans people are amongst, possibly the most, stigmatised and discriminated against minorities in our society. 'And every time we oversimplify this debate, trans people actually suffer and I think it's important, they're such a tiny minority, that we actually take the issues around protecting and enhancing the rights of trans people seriously.' It comes amid reforms planned by the SNP that would allow people in Scotland to change their legal sex just by signing a declaration - and would not need a medical diagnosis or the approval of a doctor. Miss Sturgeon also said in The Times interview that she would argue until her 'dying breath' that there was no conflict between women's rights and trans rights. Female rights campaigners have written to politicians and election candidates urging them to define 'woman', and they said anyone who does not reply with the dictionary definition of 'adult human female' should not be trusted. The For Women Scotland campaign group said: 'Sturgeon reminds us of no one so much as Thatcher around the time of the poll tax, wilfully ploughing on despite all evidence that she is wrong and declaring that she knows better than others but refusing to explain why.' The Scottish Tories have pledged to protect female-only spaces in council facilities. But former leader Ruth Davidson failed to wholeheartedly support this policy. She said: 'In terms of making sure that we absolutely look after women's safety and women's rights and single-sex spaces and all the rest of it - I agree that we need absolute reassurances about that.  'But we also need to have a real understanding and compassion for people who are one of the most persecuted minorities in this country.' Pressed again on whether she can say she supports her party's stance on single-sex spaces, she said: 'I absolutely support the position that we need to give our women and our girls reassurances about single-sex spaces. 'But I also believe that we can be better about making sure that both trans men and trans women are safe and have understanding and services to help them in their transition. I don't think these things have to be in conflict.'",

Johal Rathour, 18, of Grays, Essex, can be seen in CCTV footage driving into oncoming traffic as terrified motorists veer out of his way to avoid being hit.  But the teen eventually crashed head on with a Mercedes van, before fleeing the scene on foot.   He was identified by officers from the Met's Road and Transport Policing Command after he caused the crash just after 4am on August 6 last year.  There were no serious injuries but Rathour caused PS80,000 of damage to the van and the stolen Range Rover he was driving. He also cost Transport for London PS585,000 in lost revenue, due to Blackwall Tunnel having to be shut for more than two hours during rush hour traffic. Rathour ran away from the scene of the crash but was arrested a short time later after officers forensically identified him and tracked his mobile phone. After he was charged with the offences, Rathour failed to attend court.  He was subsequently tracked down and arrested by RTPC officers in January this year.  Police Constable Adam Lamb, the investigating officer in the case, said: 'Rathour was guilty of an incredibly dangerous piece of driving and it was a miracle that nobody was seriously injured. 'Watching the video of him driving the wrong way through the tunnel is very distressing as it seems inevitable that a fatal collision would happen. 'As well as the damage to the stolen vehicle and the van he collided with, Rathour also disrupted and delayed the journeys of thousands of people using Blackwell Tunnel on the day of the crash. 'I am glad that he has faced justice for his actions and will not be able to drive on the roads of London for many years.'",
  "781a1f2f6e5944be484022324c2320c3b285ea3e6fbd2374614ce3fc": "Boris Johnson today insisted he is honest and just got it 'wrong' over Partygate as he faces a huge blow in local elections with a poll suggesting the Tories are set to lose nearly 550 seats. The PM said he did his best to represent his beliefs 'faithfully and accurately' as he was interviewed by Susanna Reid on ITV's Good Morning Britain. A clearly uncomfortable Mr Johnson stressed that he 'inadvertently' misled Parliament over whether lockdown rules were breached in Downing Street, and had apologised since being fined by police. He said he had not received any other penalty notices yet but had 'no idea' whether that would change.  He also wriggled as he was grilled on how he was going to help people with the cost-of-living crisis, batting away calls for a windfall tax on energy firms reaping the benefits of soaring oil and gas prices. Mr Johnson conceded that inflation could hit 10 per cent in the coming months, and suggested there was 'more' the government could do - but declined to say what that might be.  The comments came as a shock survey found Labour is in line to gain more than 800 councillors in the contests on Thursday. Meanwhile, the Conservatives could see their numbers dive by 548 - in what would be a disastrous result for the PM as MPs mull a coup in the wake of the Partygate scandal.  It would be the worst Tory showing since Tony Blair was Labour leader, with flagship councils such as Wandsworth and Westminster on the line as well as Southampton and Thurrock.   The latest research for Electoral Calculus and Find Out Now interviewed 1,749 adults in the 201 councils holding ballots this week.  Asked on GMB if he is 'honest', Mr Johnson said: 'Yes. I think the best way to judge that is to look at what this Government says it's going to do and what it does.' He added: 'I do my best to represent faithfully and accurately what I believe, and sometimes it's controversial and sometimes it offends people, but that's what I do.' In response to a suggestion that some people believe he is a liar, Mr Johnson said: 'If you are talking about the statements I've made in the House of Commons, I was inadvertently... I was wrong and I've apologised for that.' The snapshot suggested Labour will end up holding 3,500 council seats compared to under 980 for the Conservatives.  The vote share of 24 per cent for the Tories and 39 per cent for Labour means the biggest advantage in local elections since the mid-1990s.  Martin Baxter, chief executive of Electoral Calculus, which conducted the survey with Find Out Now, told the Telegraph: 'The renewed partygate focus has made a poor situation for the Conservatives even worse by persuading even more Conservative supporters not to turn out at the local elections. 'The results could now be bad for Boris Johnson, especially if the Con servatives lose many hundreds of council seats and key flagship councils like Wandsworth or Westminster.' However, Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan denied that the results would be a verdict on Mr Johnson's premiership. She told Sky News: 'I think there are some places where there's some close fights but I think also in many places, certainly on doors I've been knocking on, there's been a continuing support at a local level.' She added: 'As ever with local councils' elections, we'll win some and we'll lose some, that's the nature of the beast anyway ... but what I think we will see is a really strong showing by Conservative voters who want to come out and demonstrate that they know that locally-run councils run by Conservatives are better.' Asked if the results would be seen as a referendum on the Prime Minister, she replied: 'No.' She added: 'As I say, 12 years into government you do get ... sometimes a protest vote and that's the beauty of democracy, that's one of the reasons we're supporting Ukraine as they fight to maintain their democratic right to be a free nation.' Local elections are taking place across the UK on May 5, with more than 4,000 council seats up for grabs in England. They include parts of the Red Wall such as Bury, as well as Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and all 32 London boroughs.  There have been claims that the Tories are facing an even worse outcome, losing up to 800 seats. But a narrower outcome could be tricky to interpret as many of the seats were last contested when the UK was still in the EU, Theresa May was in No10 and Labour was led by Jeremy Corbyn. Experts have pointed out that Labour had a very strong performance in 2018, suggesting the party could struggle to make further big gains - despite polls showing a national lead and massive advantage in London.    Although many of the issues that decide local elections remain the same - such as bin collections and services - they will inevitably be interpreted through the prism of Partygate in the wake of Mr Johnson's fine. Restive Conservatives have been holding off a decision on whether to mount a coup until the results come in, meaning the aftermath is likely to be the moment of maximum danger for the PM.  In a number of boroughs such as Wandsworth, Conservative candidates have been adding 'local' to ballot papers in an effort to offset the impact of Partygate.  Labour and the Lib Dems have been accused of giving each other clear runs in seats where they are taking on Conservatives. ",
  "174ad03f63751ad5bbb8d33eee61a760f402802999d6d4a8419e23f6": "Chris Kamara has revealed he offered to quit new ITV series The Games over his recent health worries but was talked out of it by show bosses. The former Leeds United and Bradford City, 64, star recently developed apraxia of speech resulting in him taking a break from his long-standing role on Sky Sports, which he subsequently quit from on Saturday after 24 years. And he admits his diagnosis almost threatened his latest TV gig until ITV chiefs persuaded him to stay on and signed up an experienced commentator to work alongside him. Speaking at the launch of the show, Chris, affectionately known as 'Kammy', said: 'I did offer to quit, which would have been good news, but ITV wouldn't have it in any way shape or form, they said 'you're staying, you're part of the team' and I'd like to thank them for that. 'They bought in Simon Brotherton to work alongside me in the commentary box, Simon and I know each other, we did 5 Live back in 1998 together when I first started broadcasting. I am on the mend, which is the great thing.' Chris told how he was flooded with messages of support from people in and outside of the football world wishing him a speedy recovery. Fans had become concerned with his welfare last month after noticing he was slurring his words on TV, with the presenter later revealing he had been struggling with the neurological condition that makes speech difficult. He's now inspired other sufferers to come forward and get help. Chris explained: 'So many people came forward when I said I was struggling and they said you can get better and I've had professors, people getting involved with me and I am on the mend hopefully in two weeks' time I'll be even better and back to my old self. 'I am in an oxygen tube weekly, I have micro currents going through my body, I am trying absolutely everything to get it sorted and thankfully it is working.' Former England cricket captain Freddie Flintoff, 44, who will front the series alongside Holly Willoughby, 41, is delighted Chris remained onboard and says he based his own commentary skills on the Soccer Saturday cult hero. He said: 'He used to do Ninja Warrior and I ended up doing his job on Ninja Warrior in Australia for three or four series and I'm going to admit it Kammy, I just ripped you off. He helped me so much without even knowing it.' The Games, which airs this month, sees 12 celebrities, including Strictly's Kevin Clifton, 39, Love Island star Wes Nelson, 24, and Spice Girl Mel B's daughter Phoenix Chi Gulzar, 23, go head to head across a week of different challenges such as diving, swimming, cycling and running. And Freddie has already picked up his favourite. He explained: 'Wes Nelson is a proper athlete - but the pressure is going to be on him. 'Colson Smith, probably at the end of the spectrum but he's got a chance. A lot of it is how they throw it together. 'It's not just about how physically fit you are it's about putting it all together, it's live TV, which I am slightly nervous about.'",
  "a040f684b1c699485db0f375eca8144027527b77add6370ed05904f6": "It was once mooted as a home for newlyweds Harry and Meghan. Now it is said to be the first choice of properties on the Queen's Windsor estate for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their boisterous young family. But could there be a rival to take over Adelaide Cottage, just a few minutes' walk from the Queen's private apartments at Windsor Castle? For the Mail understands that Prince Andrew, who lives nearby at Royal Lodge, has long had his eye on it for his younger daughter, Princess Eugenie, 32. She has been living with her husband, Jack Brooksbank, and their baby son August in Frogmore Cottage, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's home on the Queen's estate. Harry and Meghan kept it on despite moving to the US, after coming to an undisclosed financial arrangement with the Crown Estate. In November 2020, a year after they quit the UK, they allowed cousin Eugenie and her husband to move in. The Yorks had vacated their first home together - Ivy Cottage at Kensington Palace - for a life in the country close to the princess' parents. But while Harry and Meghan's gesture is clearly a generous one, the couple know it might not be long-term, especially if the Sussexes start to return to the UK more regularly. When they flew to see the Queen just before Easter, Harry and Meghan stayed at Frogmore overnight with Eugenie and her family. But that clearly wouldn't be very practical for a longer stay, especially if the Sussexes have children Archie and Lilibet in tow. Yesterday, sources close to the Yorks told the Daily Mail that Eugenie 'had been trying to secure Adelaide Cottage for a while [ready] for when she moves out of Frogmore.' They added: 'Before Andrew's most recent scandal it was definitely a property he was [also] trying to secure for his daughter.' It is not clear whether they still have an interest in it. And there is no doubt that if push comes to shove, the Cambridges and their children - all direct heirs to the throne - would get first refusal. As first revealed by the Mail, the couple have been planning a move to Berkshire since last year and have enrolled Prince George in a new school there, where he is expected to be joined this September by his siblings Charlotte and Louis. William, 39, and Kate, 40, are keen for the youngsters to have a country upbringing and want to be closer to the duchess's parents, Michael and Carole Middleton, who play a hands-on role in their upbringing. The couple have looked at several properties on the Windsor estate including Frogmore House, which is now used for royal functions but would need a great deal of work and money to turn into a family home, and Fort Belvedere. Both are believed to have been deemed unsuitable. They have also been looking at private homes in the area as well. But Adelaide Cottage, which has been used as a grace-and-favour home for royal staff and family friends in recent years, could be the one. The news that the Cambridges were first eyeing up the property was revealed in the Mail on Sunday last month. Yesterday it was further claimed that the couple, who want to be in their new home by the summer, are viewing it as their 'first choice'. Nestled at the heart of the Crown Estate's private 655-acre royal park, Adelaide Cottage was built in 1831 as a retreat for William IV's wife Queen Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen. It was also known to be a favourite home of Queen Victoria, as she frequently enjoyed taking her breakfast there. However, the most famous former resident has to be the late Princess Margaret's ex-beau, Group Captain Peter Townsend, whose affair with the Queen's sister caused a national scandal. The cottage underwent major renovations in 2015, which means the Cambridges would not have to shell out millions in remodelling the house. After all they still have a 20-plus room home, Apartment 1A at Kensington Palace, and Anmer Hall on the Queen's Sandringham estate. And Adelaide Cottage still boasts original features including a marble Graeco-Egyptian fireplace and a principal bedroom with a coved ceiling featuring gilded dolphins and rope ornament reused from the Royal yacht Royal George. It also has seven gated entrances and exits to Windsor Castle so the family can come and go in relative privacy. Kensington Palace declined to comment last night. But the Mail understands an announcement about the Cambridges' plans is expected in the coming weeks. Ghosts of Margaret's scandalous romance still haunt Victoria's cherished retreat By BETH HALE  As royal residences go, Adelaide Cottage has neither the proportions nor grandeur of its larger, more illustrious neighbour. But what it lacks in stature, this picture-postcard cottage standing in the shadows of Windsor Castle more than makes up for in its intriguing role in one of the best-known love affairs of the 20th century. For back in the years following the Second World War, Adelaide Cottage was the grace-and-favour home of Group Captain Peter Townsend. He, of course, was the dashing RAF pilot and later equerry to King George VI who would precipitate a scandal, becoming the divorced lover of Princess Margaret. Back when it was built in 1831 by King William IV for his wife Queen Adelaide, the cottage was a day retreat for the royal couple. Although it seemingly fell out of favour with the queen after the death of her husband in 1837, it remained a popular destination for breakfast or tea with his successor, the young Queen Victoria. So popular, in fact, that a new private carriageway was created for her. Not only that, her beloved King Charles spaniel, Dash, was buried in the grounds. But the most intriguing interlude in the cottage's history came with the appointment of Peter Townsend to the King's staff. The Battle of Britain pilot was married to Rosemary and had a toddler son, Giles, and another, Hugo, on the way, when he was made the King's equerry in February 1944 and granted the use of a grace-and-favour property, tucked behind a ten-foot privet hedge, within walking distance of the 'office'. Adelaide Cottage became the first proper marital home for Townsend and his wife after three years of wartime marriage - though back then it was far from a glamorous proposition. Power was delivered along cables running from Windsor Castle, but the current was so poor it could only support a vacuum cleaner and a small electric heater at any one time. The inside of the cottage was apparently a gloomy affair, decorated with Victorian wallpaper and heavy furniture, which might explain why one 1950s commentator described it as 'poky and unattractive'. Not that it deterred a certain young princess - and her family - from visiting. When Townsend's second son was born, King George VI was named the boy's godfather and the christening tea, with two princesses in attendance, was held at Adelaide. As a 1950s report from this newspaper would later remark: 'It was the first of many Sunday visits. Princess Elizabeth liked to chat with Rosemary, while Princess Margaret played with the children on the lawn and Peter Townsend, off duty, sat back in a deckchair. 'Sometimes the King and Queen arrived to collect their daughters, more often Peter ran them home himself. Princess Margaret never came to Adelaide Cottage unless she was accompanied by Princess Elizabeth or the Queen. A schoolgirl when Townsend first moved in to the cottage, Margaret was largely unnoticed by Townsend at first. Although he made quite an impression on her. Years later the princess, who was 13 at the time of his appointment, would admit: 'When he first appeared, I had a terrific crush on him.' How intriguing then to think of the visits the young princess, together with her older sister, made to Adelaide Cottage in those post-war years and how that crush developed into the passionate affair that rocked the monarchy. Quite when the spark was lit is unknown. It wasn't until after the Townsends divorced in 1952 - and a famous moment during the Queen's Coronation the following year when Margaret was seen tenderly removing a piece of fluff from Townsend's lapel - that the affair would become public knowledge. But it is now widely believed it began years earlier, during that time when the two sisters were occasional visitors to Adelaide Cottage - a time when, significantly, Townsend was never far from the Royal Family in his work for the King. It was a three-month State tour of South Africa, from February 1947 - on which the two princesses accompanied the King and Queen - that pitched Townsend, 32, and Margaret, then nearly 17, into near-constant company. Part of the equerry's role was to chaperone the teenager - the two were in each other's company every day, riding out and taking in the sights. She would later tell a confidante: 'We rode together every morning in that wonderful country, in marvellous weather. That's when I really fell in love with him.' In 2017 Daily Mail columnist Craig Brown revealed how a reader of his book about Margaret -- Ma'am Darling: 99 Glimpses Of Princess Margaret - had unearthed fresh information which some might view as startling. What it suggested was that the affair began years earlier than is popularly accepted. Indeed, it seems that when the Princess launched the ship the Edinburgh Castle on October 16, 1947, she was already in a relationship with Townsend, who was then 32 and the father of two young sons. While there is no proof they were intimate at that stage, the reader had uncovered notes among official paper showing that on the visit to the shipyard, on which Townsend accompanied her, a request was made for them to have adjoining bedrooms at Hillsborough Castle, the then governor's official residence in Belfast. Was this request spurred on by an intimacy already established at Adelaide Cottage? Further evidence of the closeness of the pair when Townsend lived in the Windsor house came in Sarah Bradford's 2002 biography of the Queen. She recounted how courtiers noticed Townsend spending more time with Margaret as his marriage faltered. One courtier recalled being at the cottage for the birthday party of one of the Townsend children. 'The telephone rang and it was someone saying 'would Peter go riding with Princess Margaret?' He was not on duty. And he went.' Townsend and his family quit Adelaide Cottage in 1952, when he divorced Rosemary. The affair, however, would be doomed by the Royal Marriages Act which stated no member of the Royal Family was permitted to marry a divorcee while the ex-partner was still living. On October 31, 1955, the Princess announced she and Townsend would not marry. Since then the cottage has been home to a host of well-connected dignitaries and courtiers, including most recently Simon Rhodes, son of the Queen's cousin and best friend Margaret Rhodes, who died in 2016. But for the most part, Adelaide Cottage had sunk back into its backdrop under the shadow of Windsor Castle's grey walls. Will it now be thrust into the spotlight again?",
  "cf9f2d44a7435aea508de8b14dbd4206bcf1d37cfb0f2854981d93a5": "Officers restrained and tried to handcuff the son of a Bournemouth university professor as he lay dying in the road after being struck by an unmarked police car, horrified witnesses claimed. Arthur Holscher-Ermert, whose father is economics lecturer Jens Holscher, died after he was hit by the black BMW in Peacehaven, East Sussex at around 11pm on Saturday night. Witnesses claimed they saw officers put handcuffs on the amateur footballer as he lay face down in the road in a pool of his own blood, crying out for help. They added that the unmarked car appeared to swerve towards Mr Holscher-Ermert before it struck him. The police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), confirmed it had launched an investigation into the death. Video footage of the immediate aftermath obtained by The Times appears to show police kneeling on Mr Holscher-Ermert's back as he lies face down in the road - as a panicked onlooker shouts at the officers: 'You've killed the man, you've killed the man'. A second clip shows Mr Holscher-Ermert on his back while an officer attempts CPR on the dying man.  A friend said he believed the police had been pursuing Mr Holscher-Ermert because he had been driving without insurance.   One witness, who gave his name as Matt, told The Times: 'A black BMW and a blue Audi came round the corner. Their blue lights came on and the BMW swerved over the road and hit this bloke.'  He claimed that Mr Holscher-Ermert was 'rolling around on the floor in pain and in shock' - and that police officers 'were still trying to cuff him', adding: 'The copper who was driving the car didn't know what to do. He tried to say he didn't do it, but we saw him.' Another man, who gave his name as Jason and said he had been near by at the time of the death, added: 'The police were judge, jury and executioners on Saturday night.'  Paying tribute to Mr Holscher-Ermert on Facebook, his brother Karl said: 'RIP my baby brother. I don't really have the words but need to get this out there.  'Last night at roughly midnight my brother Arthur Hoelscher-Ermert was run over and killed by police on South Coast Road, Peacehaven.  'Rest easy up there my boy, look after mum make sure you give her a big squeeze from me.' A friend of Mr Holscher-Ermert added: 'It's so tragic. He was such a nice guy and he's got a five-day-old baby and a girlfriend. It's devastating. I'd known him for a few years - he was just one of the lads.' Mr Holscher-Ermert had been in trouble with the police before over drugs offences, and has at least one conviction for cannabis possession from 2018.  His German-born father has taught economics at the Universities of Berlin, Swansea, Birmingham, Chemnitz and Brighton before moving to Bournemouth. His mother, Karin Ermert, a project administrator at Bournemouth University, died in 2018 aged 63. Police were examining the scene with sniffer dogs on Sunday morning and Sussex police officers spent Sunday morning trying to contact next of kin.  An IOPC spokesman said: 'We have begun an independent investigation into police actions prior to a fatal road traffic collision involving a pedestrian on Dorothy Avenue in Peacehaven, Lewes, on Saturday night. 'A man in his 20s sadly died at the scene. We were notified of the incident by Sussex Police and sent investigators to the scene and the police post incident procedures to begin our enquiries. 'Our thoughts are with the man's family at this time.' A spokesman for Sussex Police said the man died following a collision with the police vehicle on the A259 at Peacehaven just after 11.10pm. Chief Superintendent Jo Banks said: 'This is a tragic incident and we are fully supporting the IOPC investigation. 'We want to thank drivers and residents for their patience while the A259 South Coast Road was closed.'",
  "c7394cb3e8585ee406aadf418bf4232e7609b3ecea1f886227647427": "Meghan Markle 'hated' touring Australia with husband Prince Harry back in October 2018 and found the visit 'pointless,' according to former Vanity Fair editor Tina Brown. The British writer revealed Meghan's feelings during her time Down Under in her new royal biography, 'The Palace Papers'. Brown, who was Princess Diana's diarist and had close ties with the royals, discovered Meghan's seemingly unimpressed opinion of Australia through a former Palace staffer.   When the Sussexes arrived in Australia in October 2018, thousands of Australians gathered from all corners of the country to see Harry and Meghan in the flesh. The press and the public became enamoured by the presence of the two royals as they visited sites in Sydney, Melbourne, Dubbo and Queensland's Fraser Island, as well as going to the Invictus Games.   Despite the warm reception and a lively itinerary, Brown claims Meghan actually loathed the trip. 'So, Meghan must have been thrilled with it all ... right? No. She apparently hated every second of it,' she wrote.  'She didn't understand why things were set up in that way. Instead of being excited when thousands of people showed up at the Opera House, it was very much like, 'What's the purpose? I don't understand this',' a Palace employee told Brown.  The staffer said Meghan didn't appear to grasp the 'representational role' of the British monarchy when they toured, adding she was more interested in 'causes she wanted to spotlight'.  Brown's claims are supported in an article printed in The Times last year, which asserts that Meghan found it 'silly' when people crowded to see the Sussexes when they arrived in Sydney. 'What are they all doing here? It's silly,' she reportedly said to her team. A source said that she simply 'didn't get it'. The Sussexes completed 75 engagements in 16 days across Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga during the whirlwind tour - all while Meghan was in the early stages of her first pregnancy.  They were often pictured having intimate conversations, embracing fans or receiving numerous gifts from admirers during their time Down Under. Brown claims in her book that one of the main things Meghan took away from the tour was her and Harry's unrecognised importance in the royal hierarchy.  'It was head-turning for Meghan to experience the full-throttle motorcade-purring, outrider-vrooming, crowd-roaring adulation of a popular young royal on a tour planned to the last teacup by the Palace machine. 'Meghan seemed to interpret the success as a call for Brand Sussex to be elevated in the Palace hierarchy.' However, Meghan reportedly felt 'snubbed' of appreciation by the Royal Family after the couple returned to the UK.  When they did arrive home, word soon spread that all was not well within the palace, including rumours of a rift between brothers and a falling out between Meghan and Kate Middleton. Then in 2020, Meghan and Harry announced they were stepping down as senior working members of the royal family, and were later stripped of any remaining titles and patronages they had. ",
  "b0bf4876f607fa5ea299aa88e6b21e6a367c0b57f8ddef292477fbb5": "Private menopause clinics are seeing ten times as many patients as they were 18 months ago as women desperately try to access HRT medication. Experts said many women feel dismissed by NHS GPs who tell them they are 'too young' to be going through the menopause or wrongly diagnose them with depression. Many research HRT online and choose to seek treatment at private clinics due to delays in getting prescriptions and waits of around a year for an appointment with an NHS specialist. One private practice is seeing 4,000 patients a month - up from 300 in just a year and a half. GPs are under growing pressure due to a national shortage of HRT, particularly Oestrogel, which is used by around 30,000 women in the UK to help manage debilitating symptoms of the menopause. Freelance book editor Kerri Sharp had to pay PS42 online for a month's supply of Oestrogel after failing to find any at 12 pharmacies across London. Miss Sharp, 61, who would normally get her prescription free because she is over 60, said several pharmacists told her they had seen up to 50 women who had been prescribed the HRT medication but were unable to get it. She tried at least five online pharmacies before finding one that was rationing the oestrogen gel to a pack per order. Miss Sharp, from Forest Hill, south-east London, said: 'These are seriously debilitating issues that can affect your daily life. 'It's an insult and it needs to be sorted out.' The British Menopause Society has advised doctors to consider alternative medication, including Sandrena gel and Lenzetto spray. The Daily Mail launched a HRT manifesto on Saturday calling for changes including making it mandatory for medical students to be taught about the menopause and for women to be given menopause information at NHS health checks. Women must ask GPs for a new prescription when they cannot access medication. Jane Pangbourne of the HRT Truth Collective said: 'GPs are under pressure because they don't understand menopause and HRT in the sense that they haven't been trained. 'I'm not blaming GPs at all. They've been left hung out to dry in a lot of cases because they've been given misinformation or no information about HRT, so there's extra pressure on them to provide a solution to these poor women. 'The NHS waiting lists, of course, are really long anyway for everything specialist. The menopause specialist waiting lists are sometimes over a year, so women are paying to see a private specialist and even in those cases, the waiting list can be up to six months.' A survey of 464 women by a private online menopause centre found 30 per cent would consider seeing a private specialist because they do not feel they can access the care they need on the NHS. Dr Louise Newson, a menopause specialist, said her waiting list of 8,000 was 'unheard of for a private clinic'. She added: 'We have clearly reached crisis point.' The GP said she is 'appalled' that so many women are coming to her clinic for something that 'should be adequately managed in the NHS'. A statement on the website of Dr Alice Scott said the GP's private clinic has been forced to close its waiting list and is unable to make appointments for new patients due to 'unprecedented demand'. Dr Shirin Lakhani, a women's health expert, said: 'I have seen a huge increase in demand in patients coming to see me about menopause symptoms. 'Sometimes women are told they are too young to be going through the menopause or that they don't have the obvious symptoms, but the perimenopause can start in women in their 30s, although is more common between 40 and 45. 'While many women are now finding the confidence to come forward to speak about their health with their GP, they are finding that their symptoms are overlooked or diminished. 'Many are either told that this is a normal part of life and they should just put up with it until the symptoms pass, or prescribed anti-depressants to treat the associated symptoms of the menopause rather than treating the cause.' The menopause should be treated with 'protective' HRT before it 'reshapes the brain', US researchers have said. A study found it reduces grey matter, a major component of the central nervous system. How does HRT work? Hormone replacement therapy eases symptoms including brain fog, disturbed sleep and hot flushes by replacing hormones that are at a lower level as women approach the menopause. HRT can come in the form of patches, tablets or gels which are available on prescription through the NHS. How much does it cost? A single NHS prescription charge costs PS9.35, or PS18.70 if a woman needs two types of hormones. This is often provided on a short-term basis, meaning regular payments - once a month, or every three. The Government has pledged to make annual prescriptions available, but this won't be implemented until next April. Many have now resorted to buying HRT for up to eight times the NHS price online. Why is there a crisis? NHS England data shows that prescriptions for HRT have more than doubled in five years following an increase in campaigning and media coverage. Besins Healthcare - which makes Oestrogel, used by 30,000 women in the UK - has expressed 'regrets' that 'extraordinary demand' has led to shortages. Other products have been affected as women switch to alternatives. What can be done? The British Menopause Society has advised women struggling to find Oestrogel to discuss other products with their GP. However, some experts have noted that women are often on a particular HRT regime that is specifically tailored to their needs. Can the pharmacist help? If a pharmacy is out of stock, a patient must first be referred back to their GP to be given a prescription for an alternative. The Royal Pharmaceutical Society has called for pharmacists to be able to make minor changes to a prescription to provide a suitable alternative. In addition, patients face a postcode lottery as pharmacies often cannot share stock with each other. Is it dangerous to swap your HRT medicine? Medical professionals have warned that sharing or swapping HRT products could lead to 'serious side effects' that can be debilitating, not least because different products will have different dosages. Trading with others also could mean accidentally using out-of-date medicine. When will the crisis end? Besins has said it is doing 'everything we can' to increase supplies to wholesalers and pharmacies across the country. The company said it is on track to meet growing demand in June. What are ministers doing? The Health Secretary has appointed an HRT tsar to help tackle the crisis. Madelaine McTernan, the woman responsible for securing Covid vaccines for the UK, will lead efforts to address shortages. Sajid Javid said he will leave 'no stone unturned' to make sure women get the HRT they need.",
  "a24e09608137d22e9bf884434ece74d43c6e1537f59b889fe03b6c2d": "More than half of all US states have some kind of abortion ban law that is likely to take effect if Roe v Wade is overturned by the United States Supreme Court, according to a report. On Monday, a leaked Supreme Court draft opinion written by Samuel Alito and published by POLITICO revealed that the court has voted to strike down the landmark 1973 ruling, which legalized abortion in the United States. Alito wrote in part, 'Roe was egregiously wrong from the start.' The George W. Bush-appointed justice goes on to say that the issue of abortion should be returned to the 'people's elected representatives' to decide.  The opinion was drafted in February 2022. It's likely that a final ruling will be made public within the next two months, reports Politico.   Republican-appointed justices - Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett voted with Alito.  And states across the country are laying the groundwork for what comes after the more than 40-year-old ruling is nullified.  According to the pro-reproductive rights group The Guttmacher Institute, at least 22 states have laws on the books that would come into effect once the decision is officially adopted. The organization also identified four more states that it expects to pass new abortion bans in the near future, marking a total of 26 states that appear set to ban the procedures.  The 18 states that have near-total bans on abortion already on the books are Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.  In addition, Georgia, Iowa, Ohio, and South Carolina all have laws that ban abortions after the six-week mark.  At the time of writing, those six-week bans have been ruled unconstitutional.  On the same day as the Alito opinion was made public, The Washington Post reported that Republican lawmakers were plotting with pro life activists for a federal ban on abortions if Roe was overturned and the GOP won back the house.   The institute also says that four other states: Florida, Indiana, Montana and Nebraska, are likely to pass bills when Roe v Wade is overturned.  Florida already has a 15-week abortion ban that will go into effect in July 2022. The law does not make any exceptions for cases of rape or incest. There is an exception if the health of the patient is in danger. In signing the law into effect, Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a statement, 'Life is a sacred gift worthy of our protection, and I am proud to sign this great piece of legislation which represents the most significant protections for life in the state's modern history.' Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas, West Virginia and Wisconsin's bans all have pre-Roe v Wade laws that became unenforceable after the Supreme Court's 1973 decision - that would kick into effect if the federal legal precedent established in Roe were overturned. Alabama, Arizona, Michigan, Mississippi, Oklahoma, West Virginia and Wisconsin's laws allow for abortions if the patient's life is in danger.  Alabama also allows for abortions in order to preserve the health of the patient.  Arkansas, Oklahoma, Mississippi and Texas have further bans that will come into effect if the law was overturned. These were passed post-Roe v Wade. They're joined by Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah and Wyoming, in passing such laws.  The Oklahoma legislature just passed a six-week abortion ban, similar to Texas, in April 2022. Similar to the Texas law, it allows for the state to file lawsuits against those who are found to have helped someone to get an abortion after the six-week period.  Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt said in September 2021 tweet, 'I promised Oklahomans I would sign every piece of pro-life legislation that came across my desk.'  The states that will limit abortions based on the length of time a patient has been pregnant are Arkansas, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, North Dakota and Ohio.  There are four states that have laws that believe that abortion is not a constitutionally protected right are Alabama, Louisiana, Texas and West Virginia.   On the other side of the spectrum, 16 states and the District of Columbia have laws that protect a person's right to an abortion.  The Guttmacher report notes that there are over 40 million women who live in states with laws considered hostile to those seeking abortions.",
  "d6ccd1c0b07661dae01b7c6cf3526a5659612f08e7e4c68468c7d6d7": "GPs are being forced to care for 2,200 patients each because of NHS staff shortages. An extra 3.1million patients have been registered since June 2017 yet the number of fully qualified family doctors has fallen by 1,343 over the same period. It means each GP has 10 per cent more names on their lists than five years ago. And a postcode lottery is leaving some areas desperately short of cover, with just one doctor to look after 3,000 patients. The shocking figures come after NHS Digital revealed that GPs are rushing through a fifth of appointments in five minutes or less. The revelations will pile pressure on ministers to honour their promise of hiring an extra 6,000 family doctors by 2024. 'The national shortage of GPs means it is a struggle securing an appointment,' said Dennis Reed of Silver Voices, which campaigns for elderly people. 'Some people give up trying, which leaves them at risk of deteriorating, while others will end up at the door of busy A&Es. More needs to be done to get doctors into general practice and to stop experienced ones from retiring early. 'But we need to increase GP numbers equitably, so we can end this postcode lottery of care.' There were 58.4million patients registered with a GP in England in June 2017, rising 5.4 per cent to 61.57million by March this year. Meanwhile, the number of full-time and fully qualified GPs fell 4.6 per cent from 29,112 to 27,769 over the same period. It means the number of patients per GP rose by 10.46 per cent, from 2,007 to 2,217. Blackburn with Darwen was worst off, with 3,004 patients per qualified GP in March, according to analysis of NHS data by the Liberal Democrats. By contrast, Wirral had just 1,762 patients per GP - the lowest ratio. More than a third of GP practices have stopped booking routine appointments after being overwhelmed with calls, a survey reveals. Family doctors say severe staff shortages and unprecedented demand have forced them to turn sick patients away. Of 824 doctors surveyed by GP magazine Pulse, 35 per cent said their surgery had stopped booking routine consultations at some point over the past year. Dr Nick Morton, a GP partner in Norfolk and Waveney, said: 'We operate a safety valve system so when we are overwhelmed, we stop pretending we have enough resources. Patients are directed to the walk-in centre, local pharmacies or if they perceive it to be an emergency, A&E.' The system does not apply to some, including 'the vulnerable and end-of-life patients', and is not used often. But it gives practice staff a 'sense of being able to cope when deluged with demand', Dr Morton said. Dr Gaurav Gupta, a GP and chairman of the Kent Local Medical Committee, said it was 'not surprising' practices had been unable to provide services. In March, GPs in England had more than 15million patient consultations - the highest number since records began, according to NHS Digital data. Daisy Cooper, Lib Dem health spokesman, said: 'Our health services are at breaking point following the Conservative Government's broken promise to recruit more GPs. 'People are struggling to get appointments and GPs are under more pressure than ever. We need a proper plan to recruit the GPs the country desperately needs and prevent so many doctors leaving or retiring early.' Commenting on the numbers, Healthwatch England, which represents patients, said access to GP services was one of the most common issues raised by the public. It added: 'Things need to change for the sake of patient care, staff welfare and the sustainability of the wider NHS.' Dr Kieran Sharrock, deputy chairman of the British Medical Association's GP committee, said: 'With fewer doctors to treat more patients, it's harder to see people in a timely way and GPs share their patients' frustration with longer waits. 'Remaining staff are forced to stretch themselves further, risking their own physical and mental health, which then drives them away from the profession, making the problem even worse. 'We need the Government to listen to and support GPs and their colleagues, and make good on its pledges to boost the GP workforce so that practices can provide the safe, quality care that patients deserve.' Dr Rachel Ward, of the Rebuild General Practice campaign, described the shortage of GPs as a 'national emergency'. She added: 'Years of underfunding, neglect and broken government promises have led to fewer GPs, at a time when there are more patients than ever. 'GPs want to provide the best quality care for their patients, but the current situation is unsafe. 'That's why we're calling for urgent support to rebuild general practice.' More than a third of appointments at GP surgeries were still not face to face in March, the NHS Digital figures show. Many switched to video or phone consultations during the pandemic but have not returned to normal levels. Some 81.0 per cent of appointments took place in-person in October 2019, pre-Covid. This dipped to a low of 46.7 per cent in April 2020 and climbed to a recent high of 64.3 per cent in October 2021 as restrictions were eased. But only 62.0 per cent of the 29.6million appointments conducted this March at GP surgeries were face to face. This total includes appointments at surgeries with nurses, physiotherapists and pharmacists as well as doctors. Government research shows most GPs now work no more than three days a week. The study commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Care shows a 'substantial' fall in hours worked since the pandemic, with just half of family doctors in work on Friday afternoon. A spokesman for the department said the number of GPs in England had increased in recent years when considering those still in training. They added: 'We are working with the NHS to improve access to GPs, tackle the Covid backlog, and grow the general practice workforce to ensure everyone receives the care they need - including making PS520million available to improve access and expand general practice capacity during the pandemic. 'There were over 1,400 more full-time equivalent doctors working in general practice in March 2022 compared with March 2019, a record-breaking number started training as GPs last year, and we've invested PS1.5billion until 2025 to create an extra 50million appointments a year.' A survey earlier this year revealed that patient satisfaction with GP surgeries has plummeted to its lowest ever level. Fewer than four in ten patients said they happy with the service. The British Social Attitudes survey found the approval rating had almost halved in the pandemic.  ",
  "d0319f0998bad9c7a90e6b7c26e218ebd80a11961ed862726fe52502": "Four and a half years ago, on a characteristically gloomy November day on the River Clyde, Nicola Sturgeon was having a very special day out.  At Ferguson Marine shipyard in Port Glasgow on Scotland's west coast, just a few miles down the road from Scotland's largest city, the First Minister was guest of honour at the launch of its pride and joy, a new ferry named the Glen Sannox, built to serve Scotland's island communities.  A special platform had been constructed for her and other VIPs. Scotland's First Minister was given pride of place as the new ship slid down the slipway and into the black waters of the Clyde estuary. That day in 2017 saw Ms Sturgeon and the SNP at the peak of their powers. Three years earlier, just before the Scottish independence referendum, the yard had been saved from collapse in a deal brokered by her predecessor Alex Salmond.  After succeeding him, Ms Sturgeon had awarded it the contract to build the Glen Sannox and another vessel.  In a part of Britain where the history of shipbuilding occupies a near-mythical grip on the popular imagination, it was a proud moment, and it was the First Minister who had made it happen.  'Ship launches are always emotional occasions but to have the return of commercial shipbuilding here on the Clyde at Ferguson's is extra special,' she gushed to waiting cameras. It seemed all was well. But the reality was rather different. Attentive observers noticed that the windows on the bridge of the Glen Sannox weren't real; they were fakes, painted on to make the ship appear finished for the occasion.  Nor was the hull in any way seaworthy. The 'launch' was for the cameras. At the end of the day, the cameras and Ms Sturgeon all went home.  And, staggeringly, 52 months on from the First Minister's big day out, the Glen Sannox remains at the dock, unfinished.  Its sister vessel is even further behind.  Islanders, for whom these ferries are a lifeline connecting them to the mainland, are having to make do with an ageing fleet that regularly breaks down -- only last week, the CalMacferry which serves the nearby Isle of Arran broke down.  The two new ferries are now more than four years overdue. On one level the debacle over the Glen Sannox is laughable -- unlike Helen of Troy, Nicola of Edinburgh is the face who hasn't launched so much as a dinghy.  But this scandal on the Clyde is now shining a spotlight on a much wider Scottish phenomenon: what might be called the 'Sturgeonisation' of government north of the border.  Like the fake windows of the Glen Sannox, it is a government that is often painted-on only. Governing isn't the priority; its primary purpose is the break-up of the United Kingdom.  And up till now, Scots have lapped up Ms Sturgeon's pledge to 'stand up for Scotland' -- while giving the boot to the unpopular Boris Johnson. Now the act is wearing thin.  The ferries fiasco has shown my fellow Scots that the SNP games and the endless politics are not cost-free. It leads to a government both incompetent and corrupt.  And as the full scale of the scandal emerges, the question lingering alongside the unloved, unfinished Glen Sannox is whether Ms Sturgeon's struggle to break up Britain is also beginning to slide down the slipway, to sit marooned in a siding.  The story of the ship that didn't sail has dominated the home news agenda in Scotland over the past few weeks. It began in late March with a devastating report by the country's independent spending watchdog, Audit Scotland.  Right from the off, the report concluded, the project had been beset by 'a lack of transparent decision-making, a lack of project oversight and no clear understanding of what significant sums of public money have achieved'.  And the detail of the report revealed something highly irregular. In 2015, the Ferguson yard told transport chiefs it couldn't provide a refund guarantee if things went wrong -- normally a standard element in any contract. Scotland's public ferry agency consequently warned the SNP the project was too risky.  Yet while the alarm lights were flashing, we have now learned that Ms Sturgeon's government insisted the plans -- and the photo-ops -- carry on. Audit Scotland has drily concluded there is 'insufficient evidence' to explain why. And over recent weeks, the plot has only thickened.  Pursued for an answer, Ministers have shrugged -- either the documentation has gone missing or never existed in the first place.  This, commented Ms Sturgeon last week, was 'regrettable'. The stench of a cover-up is everywhere.  Back at the yard, there are fears the two ships will remain stuck in the dock for some more months, possibly years, to come.  Which is also where, this spring, we find the SNP. Ever since they rescued the yard in the run-up to the referendum, both Alex Salmond and then Nicola Sturgeon took every opportunity to enjoy their apparent success down on the Clyde.  Even when the SNP was forced to nationalise it as the project turned bad, the rescue was sold as a triumph. Here was a perfect opportunity to show off the SNP's mantra that they, and they alone, 'stand up for Scotland'.  Indeed, in one cringingly embarrassing promotional video, Ms Sturgeon boasted of just this in front of the ship itself.  But the Audit Scotland report and the growing scandal around secret decisions and conveniently misplaced documents, has shown Scotland the price tag attached to this hubris.  The original cost of PS97 million could potentially now hit more than PS400million. The profligacy has been summed up by revelations over the hiring of a government appointed 'turnaround' director who came in as things went dowhill.  He was paid an eye-watering PS3,000 a day, and when he quit last year, as his parting shot, he revealed that a series of cables, bought for the ship's wiring, actually weren't long enough to be used. It stinks.  The refusal of the SNP to say why they insisted this disaster go ahead despite warnings has prompted former First Minister Jack McConnell to suggest the police should now get involved.  The question is simple: what are they hiding? One badly run project might be brushed aside. But this tale of incompetence, secrecy and alleged corruption fits a fast-emerging pattern.  It isn't just ferries. For Scotland is now becoming littered with examples of disastrous SNP interventions which look great to begin with, cost a lot, deliver little and are often left mired in secrecy and denial.  There is Prestwick Airport, also nationalised by the SNP in 2013, after it had been incurring annual losses of PS2million.  The then deputy First Minister, one Nicola Sturgeon, promised the government would soon be 'turning Prestwick around and making it a viable enterprise'.  Almost ten years on, a cross-party committee of MPs slammed the now First Minister for ploughing in PS50million, with no prospect of a buyer.  Edinburgh and Glasgow airports have rightly questioned why a publicly owned airport has been given cash, while they had to suffer during the pandemic. No answer was given.  There is the SNP's flagship Scottish National Investment Bank , championed as a way to boost growth in Scotland but whose chief executive -- who took home a cool PS235,000 a year -- resigned last month.  She hasn't explained why and, as with the ferries, Ms Sturgeon insists it's nobody's business to know.  There was the quiet deal the SNP struck with Indian steel magnate Sanjeev Gupta under which he bought an aluminium plant in the Scottish Highlands in return for state guarantees worth more than PS500million.  Last week, the offices of Mr Gupta's Liberty Steel company were visited by the Serious Fraud Office. The taxpayer is on the hook.  On the other hand, at least Ms Sturgeon got a nice photograph alongside the businessman. Then last month, the Scottish Government took over the country's rail operator, too.  It's fair to say taxpayers and rail users are not brimming with optimism. Ms Sturgeon is still Scotland's most popular politician, it should be said.  During the pandemic, ever keen to present herself as an alternative to Boris Johnson, she held press conferences literally every day. She didn't just lead the news, she read it out.  An army of SNP spin doctors and Scottish Government press officers are on hand to promote her every utterance. She dominates the public landscape as a result.  But with the ferries scandal destroying the SNP's reputation for governing, it is all beginning to wear thin. And the true nature of Ms Sturgeon's operation is emerging. Instead of focusing on improvements to the NHS or sorting out schools, the relentless aim is to craft a story of 'us' up here and 'them' down there, south of the border.  Lest you think I exaggerate, consider internal documents released a few weeks ago under freedom of information laws.  They showed instructions from SNP ministers to their civil service speechwriters. Official addresses should 'try to avoid getting bogged down in policy unless necessary', the advice came down.  Rather, 'constitutional points' -- ie, the case for independence -- should be emphasised. And as the SNP prepares this spring and summer to restart its push for a second referendum on independence, this Sturgeonisation of our politics is becoming ever more prevalent.  Under this obsessively political plan, every issue and opportunity is used to emphasise difference between Scotland and England.  The SNP -- and their Green helpers in government -- set themselves up as ultra 'progressives' -- by, for example, introducing radical new gender laws that have incurred the ire of Edinburgh resident JK Rowling, or opposing exploration in the North Sea.  Loathing of the 'disgusting' regressive Conservative government is then ramped up. Scots are invited to reach the conclusion that Scotland is different, that Britain is divided and its end is therefore inevitable.  Dare to disagree? Then a reliable army of hypernationalists around the SNP movement are there to shout you down for being 'anti-Scottish'.  In this world, nothing is ever the SNP's fault. Scotland is instead always the victim. And this divisive rhetoric and grievance culture has consequences.  Scotland is a wonderful country but for all that the SNP preaches openness and diversity, it can often feel like a less tolerant place. Power has been centralised in Edinburgh, handing the government more control.  The theocracy of nationalism takes no prisoners. And criticism of orthodoxy is met with shin-kicking personal attacks on whoever dares put their head above the parapet.  Does it work though? On Thursday, the SNP should easily win the largest number of council seats in the local elections. More than 70 per cent of younger voters now support independence.  Wait for older sceptics like me to die off, goes the thinking, and the dream of separation will come.  Unless one of Scotland's opposition parties steps up to become a genuine alternative, they may well be right. But counter to that, as the ferries scandal shows, is the fact that time works both ways.  Because the SNP now has a dreadful record hanging over its head. To add to the ferries affair and the long list of flops already discussed, there is a cloud hanging over the mammoth Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, where at least two children died due to infections picked up in the facility.  A public enquiry into the way the SNP managed its construction, and that of another hospital in Edinburgh, is ongoing.  There is the SNP's mishandling of the Scottish economy: only the north-east of England and Northern Ireland have had lower growth rates in recent years -- even though Scotland spends more per head on economic development than anywhere else in Britain.  Then there is its record on education, where performance in maths and science recently fell to a record low. Will Scots notice? Time will tell.  When the Scottish Parliament came into being in 1999, Billy Connolly, who began his working life as a boilerman in the Glasgow shipyards, noted with that merciless humour how Scotland now had its own 'pretendy parliament'. It turns out it's worse.  Twentyfive years on, Scotland is lumbered with a pretendy government: all show, and few solutions.  In Port Glasgow, on the banks of the Clyde, can be found its pitiful legacy: a stricken boat with fake windows.  For Ms Sturgeon and co, we can only hope the tide is going out.",
  "45eccc727b68f90d9eaddddc14ff56152a29d511a449d74223f75529": "She said that her acerbic personality would be the perfect contrast with the cosiness of Countdown: 'It's like strawberries and cream - the perfect marriage.'  However, Anne Robinson told me today that she has quit her PS500,000 job as Countdown host after a year - amid rumours of a rift with Rachel Riley.  Miss Robinson, 77, informed her bosses at Channel 4 on Friday and said: 'I have had a blast - we have taken the ratings up and transformed the guests too.  'We no longer have northern newsreaders in Dictionary Corner - we have had a raft of top celebrities.  'But I have made up my mind to quit the show. I only signed on for a year and I have helped them out by doing about 40 shows more than my contract.  'I am moving on because I've got a lot going on - grandchildren, a big garden, an apartment in New York - and I want to enjoy them. Countdown has taken up more of time than I thought it would.'  She added: 'It is great fun but it is intense. I go up [to Media City in Salford] and we do 15 shows in three 11-hour days. I'm built to last so I don't really mind, but it does take up quite a chunk of my time.'  She filmed her final shows earlier this year and Channel 4 will need to find a new host by June.  Miss Robinson, who had a successful career in newspaper journalism before embarking on an even more successful career as a broadcaster, was the first female host of the show. It irritated her when this was pointed out.  Now she jokes: 'I am quitting to make way for an older woman.'  But what of her chemistry - or lack of it - with Countdown's maths whizz Rachel Riley, and Miss Riley's close friend Susie Dent in Dictionary Corner?  There were reports last year that Miss Robinson, who suffers from tinnitus, found Miss Riley unacceptably loud and was irritated by her habit of chatting on her mobile phone, and by her time-keeping.  A source said that Miss Robinson asked for Miss Riley's microphone to be muted before the show started so that she alone could talk to the contestants.  A source said: 'Rachel can be quite loud on set... Anne felt she couldn't do her job properly, or bond with the contestants to help them to relax, before the cameras started rolling. 'Poor old Rachel didn't work it out for a couple of days, and was babbling away happily before realising no one could hear her. When Anne said she wanted silence, Rachel turned around in front of the whole studio and stated that she disagreed; that she didn't find it necessary.'  Miss Robinson - famed as the host of The Weakest Link, where she gained the nickname the Queen of Mean for the way she insulted contestants - said talk of a rift is overblown. But she doesn't deny a certain distance between her and her colleagues.  'I'm not saying I would go on holiday with Rachel Riley, but she is brilliant,' she said. 'Absolutely honestly, I do admire her - she is really, really good at what she does, as is Susie Dent.  'Look, Rachel has just come back from having a baby and she is standing throughout and faultless, whereas I get to sit down. She is noisy, yes she and Susie both are - they are a formidable pair those two. But there isn't a question of my going because of a rift, that's nonsense.'  She added that the three women are virtual strangers.  'The way that it's filmed is so tight that... we don't have time to talk to each other. We shoot for an hour for a 45-minute show, it's a well-oiled machine.  'Between shows we have a ten-minute turn around to get changed. We can go for almost a whole run without doing more than waving to each other from the end of a corridor.'  Countdown started in 1982 and its first host was Richard Whiteley, who served until his death in 2005. He was followed by Des O'Connor, Des Lynam, Jeff Stelling and Nick Hewer.  Miss Robinson was chosen to succeed Hewer by Channel 4's head of daytime Jo Street.  She said: 'They asked me and I didn't even take 30 seconds to say, 'Yeah, that's great, that's exactly what I want to do.''  In an interview before she began she observed: 'When Channel 4 said to me, 'You'll be the first woman', I groaned, because I was rather hoping we'd got past the stage of being completely astonished that a woman can do the same job as a man.'  So what will come next for Miss Robinson?  A summer in the garden with the grandchildren appears to beckon.  She said: 'I have learned a new lesson which is saying 'No'. I'm not going on Strictly, I'm not going to the jungle [for I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here], I'm not doing Pointless and I'm not doing Masterchef.  'The channels have upped their game with ethnic diversity, but there's not much evidence of putting older women on screen.'

New eco-friendly tags will include the person's name and their chosen pronouns, with options such as 'he/him/his', 'she/her/hers' and 'them/theirs'. Phonetic name spellings will also be available, the Sunday Telegraph reported.  The changes will be optional and name badges will be available to NatWest's 6,500 branch staff, who are also set to receive uniforms made from recycled plastic. Marks & Spencer, the BBC and the Ministry of Defence already give employees the chance to state their pronouns.  NatWest said the initiative was aimed at making staff feel more 'comfortable or respected'.   This follows a successful trial that was first announced by the banking group last year. NatWest, formerly known as the Royal Bank of Scotland, serves about 19million customers across the UK and Ireland. Last month, the Home Office sparked controversy after it told employees to declare their pronouns in their emails to make life more welcoming for trans people. Staff working at the Visa, Status and Immigration Services department were instructed to say in their emails whether they are a man, woman or non-binary. They were informed that the new rules on pronouns were taking place because of 'the wider cultural changes' taking shape in the department.",

The National Citizen Service (NCS) was launched in 2011 as part of Mr Cameron's 'Big Society' plans and has received more than PS1.3billion in taxpayer funding - including PS75million in public money last year. The NCS, which was designed especially for 16- and 17-year-olds, now faces accusations of putting young people at risk by letting them choose which showers, toilets and dorms they use, The Telegraph reports.  One mother who voiced concerns about the policy was allegedly told that if girls were not comfortable with a male in their bedroom then they needed to be 'educated to respect the identity' of that person.  Another claims that in 2019 her son left a camp because he was sharing a male dorm with a trans boy and a teenage male who were in a sexual relationship.  One 16-year-old boy who recently started identifying as female had signed up to the camp this year and was asked which room he would prefer to sleep in, one mother said, adding that she was told the camp would 'allow the young people to self-ID' and they would be placed in 'whichever dorm they feel comfortable in'.  Organisers said that if a girl had a reason for not sharing such as a past trauma or religious belief then they would not be placed with a biological male.  Chief executive of the NCS Trust, Mark Gifford, said that safeguarding is taken 'incredibly seriously'. He added: 'It is of paramount importance and we are proud of our exemplary track record. While our policy does acknowledge that accommodation decisions are made on a case-by-case basis by our delivery partners, we would never condone any decision that leaves a young person feeling vulnerable or at risk.'

Now Kirsty Young is set to make her return to the BBC - fronting its coverage of the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. The presenter, 53, hosted the classic Radio 4 interview programme for 12 years before taking a break from it in 2018.  She announced she would be leaving to receive treatment for a form of fibromyalgia - a condition that causes pain all over the body - and was replaced by Lauren Laverne, 44. In July 2019 she confirmed her temporary break would be permanent, saying it had inspired her to 'pursue new challenges'.  Now Miss Young will return to the BBC in June to anchor a full weekend of programming for the Platinum Jubilee.  She will be joined by presenters including Huw Edwards, Clare Balding, AJ Odudu, Roman Kemp and Anita Rani.  Reporters across the UK will include Jermaine Jenas at Buckingham Palace, Gethin Jones in Wales, Carol Kirkwood in Scotland, and Holly Hamilton in Northern Ireland.  Miss Young and Kemp, 29, will lead coverage of the Platinum Party at the Palace on June 4. The celebration will see famous faces from the world of entertainment brought together to perform for a night of musical tributes to celebrate the Jubilee. English singer-songwriter George Ezra is currently the only act to have been confirmed for the live concert. Ahead of her return to the BBC, Miss Young said: 'I'm delighted to be back on the BBC for such an historic, unique, and happy event. 'It's going to be quite a weekend and our coverage will bring viewers everywhere a front row seat at the celebrations. I can't wait!' The celebrations will also include the Platinum Pageant, during which Miss Young will be joined by a variety of presenters, including Strictly Come Dancing's Anton Du Beke. The pageant will bring together artistic performers, dancers, musicians, military personnel, key workers and volunteers from across the UK and the Commonwealth who will unite to tell the story of the Queen's reign in a festival of creativity. During the pageant's finale a number of national treasures will feature and Ed Sheeran will appear on stage to lead a special tribute to the Queen. The BBC will also host a variety of programmes celebrating the Queen's 70-year reign during the lead up to the Jubilee weekend and following the main celebrations. Journalist and newsreader Clive Myrie will present The Crown Jewels documentary on June 3. Speaking about the programme, Myrie, 57, said: 'It's been a really powerful journey of discovery for me finding out more about the amazing crown jewels, their importance to the monarchy and their role in the complex history of our islands.' Dame Mary Berry will host The Queen's Jubilee Pudding: 70 Years In The Baking on May 12, which will follow a nationwide competition to find an original celebratory cake or pudding to celebrate the Queen's Jubilee. The winning recipe will become a part of British culinary history, and the amateur baker who devised it will be revealed in the programme. The show's five finalists have been revealed as Shabnam, Susan, Sam, Jemma and Kathryn. A number of the BBC's most-loved shows will receive a Jubilee makeover including EastEnders, The Repair Shop and Bargain Hunt. CBBC will also be marking the weekend with a Blue Peter Jubilee takeover special on June 3, as well as continued specials on June 4 and 5 to involve younger audiences in the celebrations. BBC chief content officer, Charlotte Moore said: 'The BBC is marking The Queen's momentous Platinum Jubilee in spectacular style with an unprecedented range of special programming. 'In celebration of Her Majesty's 70 years of service the BBC will bring the people of the UK together with something for everyone to commemorate this historic anniversary culminating on the extended bank holiday weekend.' Special programming across BBC networks will start in early May through to June 5 with significant live events broadcast across the Queen's Platinum Jubilee bank holiday weekend.",
  "9534b77aac366bac088b826975c9ce75567bcc7634964fa3bbb0c76b": "The former deputy commander of the Royal Navy submarine that sank Argentine cruiser the General Belgrano today defended the controversial attack in an interview to mark the 40th anniversary of the sinking.  Vice Admiral Sir Tim McClement, who is now aged 70, was the second in command on HMS Conqueror when the vessel fired two torpedoes at the ship on May 2, 1982, during the Falklands War. The attack led to the deaths of 323 Argentine sailors and controversy has raged ever since, with critics arguing that the ship had been sailing away from the 200-mile exclusion zone that had been declared around the Falklands by Britain.  But, speaking to BBC Radio 4, the now retired Vice Admiral McClement defended the attack on the ship. He said: 'In my mind, it was definitely not a crime and it was the right thing to do. [General Leopoldo] Galtieri had invaded the island where British people were living peacefully and their independence was brutally threatened.  'It was our duty and responsibility to recover the islands for them. They started the war, it was our duty to evict them. They were a threat and they had to be dealt with, and it was exactly the right thing to do.'  The Belgrano was sunk by the Royal Navy four weeks after the start of the 10-week conflict with Argentina, which broke out after troops from the South American country invaded the Falklands, on the orders of dictatorial leader General Leopoldo Galtieri. Speaking of the moment that HMS Conqueror opened fire, Vice Admiral McClement said: 'When we heard the first explosion and the captain reported seeing smoke from the aftermath of the Belgrano there was an instant cheer on board the submarine because we had done the job we had been tasked to do by our Government successfully.  '[It was] followed almost instantaneously by absolute silence as we all thought our own thoughts.  'Mine were [that] there were over 1,000 sailors on board the Belgrano doing exactly the same, the job their government had tasked them to do. They were a long way from home and it was a cold sea.' Asked by interview Justin Webb if the Argentine sailors 'needed to die', Vice Admiral McClement insisted that they did.  'Yes they did, unfortunately. War is brutal,' he said.  'The Argentinians had two task groups, one the Belgrano to the south-west and another their aircraft carrier to the north-west of the islands.  'And they were both a threat to our carriers and if either of those groups had got through and damaged one of our carriers that would have been the end of our ability to retake the Falkland Islands.' On the question of the exclusion zone established by the UK, Vice Admiral McClement said that he later discovered that the British government had told the Argentine government on April 25, 1982, that any Argentinian forces deemed to be a threat would be dealt with.  They then gave them seven days notice to heed the warning. That warning period expired on May 2, the day the Belgrano was sunk, Vice Admiral McClement said.  He added: 'We had actually detected the Belgrano on the 1st May but we were not allowed to sink her because the seven days hadn't expired?  The Argentinian government later said the sinking of the Belgrano was an acceptable act of war, but that did not stop furious critics from arguing that Margaret Thatcher's government was wrong to attack the vessel.  In 2011, it emerged in a book that the Belgrano had in fact been sailing into the British exclusion zone when it was hit.  The book, by Major David Thorp, revealed details of a formerly top secret report that was written after Mrs Thatcher requested a 'complete and thorough investigation' into the Belgrano's sinking, amid pressure from opposition backbenchers in Parliament.  Major Thorp wrote the original report after being provided with 'every conceivable document, file, report and note imaginable that related to, or included the name, Belgrano.'  In his book The Silent Listener, he wrote: 'Shortly after the UK's announcement of the exclusion zone, the Argentinian Navy HQ notified its warships, possibly for the purpose of re-grouping, of a pre-arranged rendezvous (RV) point. 'When the co-ordinates for the RV were plotted on a map, the actual location, though east of the Falkland Islands, was nevertheless inside the 200 nautical miles exclusion zone. 'Some considerable time prior to the Conqueror firing its torpedoes, my analysis revealed that the General Belgrano had been instructed to alter course and head in the direction of the RV inside the exclusion zone. 'The findings of my report stated that the destination of the vessel was not to her home port as the Argentine Junta stated, but the objective of the ship was to relocate to a pre-arranged RV within the exclusion zone.' Major Thorp's report was never disclosed by Mrs Thatcher during her time in office because she did not want to reveal the extent of Britain's ability to intercept enemy electronic and radio signals. The book was cleared for publication by the security services.  On the BBC's Nationwide TV programme, Mrs Thatcher was famously quizzed by teacher Diana Gould about the sinking of the Belgrano.  During a fiery exchange, she fended off Ms Gould's assertions that the vessel was sailing away from the British exclusion zone.  The strike on the Belgrano signalled the first loss of life in the Falklands conflict. But two days later Argentina hit back with a missile attack on the British destroyer HMS Sheffield, killing 20. The sea battle continued for many more weeks, then the conflict turned to the land before the Argentine forces finally surrendered and peace was declared on June 20, 1982. A total of 255 British servicemen were killed, with a further 775 wounded. Argentina lost 649 men, whilst 1,657 servicemen lost their lives. ",

Jonathan Gullis, a former teacher, has launched a campaign to scrap the ban so that poorer areas can benefit. There are no grammars in the North East and almost half of the 163 in the UK are in London and the South East. Mr Gullis, the MP for Stoke-on-Trent North, said: 'We can level up the country by offering students in the most deprived constituencies the same choice in education as the least deprived.' The ban was brought in by Tony Blair in 1998. It is understood that most Tory MPs want to scrap it. But the Department for Education said there were no such plans. Mr Gullis added: 'Education is currently the very definition of a postcode lottery. Protecting existing grammar schools without creating new ones is reinforcing this. 'We cannot and must not continue with this geographic sweepstake approach to education. Pupils should be able to stay local and to go far, to coin a phrase.' Last night, a supporter of the campaign, Sir Graham Brady, told the Mail: 'Grammar schools have been a tremendous driver of social mobility and their abolition across most of the country has removed opportunity from many people. 'I strongly support Jonathan Gullis' campaign to reopen those opportunities, especially in the less affluent parts of the country. 'After 12 years of Conservative-led government, it is absurd we still have Labour's law and I hope the government will move to remove that senseless piece of legislation as soon as possible.' Mr Gullis' campaign argues that wealthy areas of the country have a 'monopoly' on grammar schools, meaning poorer areas of the UK cannot reap their benefits. In February the government identified 55 Education Investment Areas to raise school standards. Mr Gullis said there was a unique opportunity to 'end this education podcode lottery' in the target regions. Boris Johnson has historically voiced support for grammars, saying in 2014 that the 'decision to get rid of them was a real tragedy for this country.' When asked about reviving Mrs May's plans in March, Mr Zahawi said: 'Their ethos is fantastic, their DNA I want to spread in the system. 'We will continue to make sure whether it's grammar schools or Church of England or Catholic schools, they feel they can join the journey and they feel they can be part of that journey and protected as well.' He also told the Commons in March that he wants 'to spread the DNA of grammar schools across the system.'",
  "0a3c3d8dd92e80fc83a83f20da94b5a88ef86c069f8665b704ef937d": "Petrol and diesel prices could hit new records within weeks - just in time for the Platinum Jubilee bank holiday getaway in early June. Analysis by the AA found wholesale prices surged by 5p a litre last week - a rise which takes two to three weeks to be passed on at the pumps. It could mean a repeat of the situation in March, when prices were hitting new records daily. Average fuel prices were 162.4p a litre for petrol and 176.5p for diesel last week, down from a record 167.3p and 179.9p. The AA's Luke Bosdet said: 'Drivers need to brace themselves for a jump in the cost of petrol.' It is the latest hammer blow for Britain's 33million motorists, many of whom are already feeling the pinch and cutting back on journeys due to the spiralling cost of living. It also spells pain at the pumps for drivers planning on getaways during next month's Platinum Jubilee Bank Holiday and over the summer. The four-day Bank Holiday has been created to mark the Queen's 70 years on the throne. Millions are expected to take to the roads to be with friends and family for a series of events across the country marking the milestone. Prices were hitting new daily records for several weeks up until mid-March after the war in Ukraine pushed up costs amid fears of future fuel shortages. Russia is the world's third-largest oil producer. Pump prices only started falling after Chancellor Rishi Sunak slashed fuel duty on petrol and diesel by 5p a litre in his March mini-budget. Mr Bosdet said: 'Supermarkets, because of their contracts, will take longer to pass on the increases and that is where drivers should be heading to keep their costs down.' He said motorists should look to adjust their driving style if they want to further cut back on costs. 'Motorists can soften the impact of the pump price rises,' he said, 'by moderating their speeds and smoothing their driving by leaving more space between them and the car in front. 'Accelerating more gently can also save pounds.' He said one of the major factors pushing up prices was a predicted surge in demand for fuel in America and other countries as their drivers start to hit the road for their summer holidays, with the extra global demand inflating prices. He added: 'The predictable seasonal boost to petrol prices is coming into play.' The continued war in Ukraine also continues to have an impact. In March, average petrol and diesel prices surged more than any other month on record - 11p and 22p a litre respectively - meaning motorists have already endured the most costly Easter and early May Bank Holiday getaways on record. It is often at least a few weeks before retailers pass on wholesale increases because this is the time it takes to sell their cheaper stocks before re-stocking at the higher price.",

High-tech UK parts for jamming systems and military radios were discovered as experts picked through hardware abandoned by Russian forces.  One Borisoglebsk-2 mobile jamming system contained components made in the UK, US, Germany, South Korea, Taiwan and the Netherlands.  Investigators from the Royal United Services Institute military think-tank found that the Kremlin uses front companies, intermediaries and blackmail to obtain Western components. It appears that manufacturers do not know where the parts are ending up.  The UK's Department for International Trade is now exploring how it can prevent British-made parts being used by Russia's war machine.  Russia is thought to have lost 40,000 troops, either killed, captured or wounded, as well as thousands of tanks and aircraft since the war began.  Admiral James Stavridis, a former Nato commander, last night attributed Russia's failures on the battlefield to 'amazing incompetence'.",

The Prime Minister will evoke Sir Winston Churchill and salute the resistance of Ukrainians in the face of the brutality of the Russian invaders. He will also announce a new PS300million package of military support as he addresses the country's politicians by video link. His appearance comes after his surprise visit to the Ukrainian capital last month. Mr Johnson is expected to say the UK is 'proud to be among Ukraine's friends' after reopening the British embassy in Kyiv last week. In his address to Ukraine's parliament - the Verkhovna Rada - the Prime Minister will echo the words of Churchill to the British people during the Second World War. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky also invoked him when he spoke to the Westminster Parliament in March. Mr Johnson is expected to say: 'When my country faced the threat of invasion during the Second World War, our Parliament, like yours, continued to meet throughout the conflict, and the British people showed such unity and resolve that we remember our time of greatest peril as our finest hour. 'This is Ukraine's finest hour, an epic chapter in your national story that will be remembered and recounted for generations to come. 'Your children and grandchildren will say that Ukrainians taught the world that the brute force of an aggressor counts for nothing against the moral force of a people determined to be free.' Mr Johnson regards Sir Winston as his political hero and wrote a biography of the wartime leader's life called The Churchill Factor. The new military support will include electronic warfare and GPS-jamming equipment, a counter-battery radar system and thousands of night vision devices. The package comes after ministers updated Parliament last week on plans to send sophisticated long-range Brimstone missiles and Stormer air defence vehicles. The UK will also supply heavy lift aerial drones to provide logistical support to Ukrainian forces. Downing Street said it would also send more than a dozen new specialised Toyota Land Cruisers to protect civilian officials in eastern Ukraine and to evacuate civilians from frontline areas. Mr Johnson visited Kyiv last month to meet Mr Zelensky after a pledge to give PS100million worth of weapons to Ukraine. The country's parliament praised the Prime Minister, declaring: 'Be brave, like Boris. Be brave, like Ukraine.' The key Ukrainian city of Odesa is planning to honour him by naming a street or square after him. During Mr Zelensky's address to the Commons in March, he told MPs: 'I would like to remind you the words that the United Kingdom have already heard, which are important again. We will not give up and we will not lose. We will fight until the end, at sea, in the air. We will continue fighting for our land, whatever the cost. We will fight in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets.' Thanking 'civilised countries' for their support, he said: 'I'm very grateful to you Boris... Please make sure you do what needs to be done and what is stipulated by the greatness of your country. Glory to Ukraine and glory to the UK.' Britain is at the forefront of the West's response to Russia's invasion and has sent more than PS450million in military aid to the Ukrainian army, including thousands of missiles. The British embassy in Kyiv recently reopened more than two months after it was moved due to fighting. The US said yesterday it hoped its diplomats would be able to return 'by the end of the month', while Sweden will reopen its embassy tomorrow. Washington closed its embassy in Kyiv and moved its diplomats on February 14, ten days before Vladimir Putin's invasion. President Joe Biden proposed a $33billion (PS26billion) aid package to Ukraine after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi met Mr Zelensky on Saturday. Russia is continuing its assault on the industrial Donbas region, attempting to advance in the south and east after failing to capture the capital. Mr Zelensky has accused Russia of trying to 'empty' the region of people, saying peace talks are in danger of collapsing. The death toll of civilians in Ukraine has exceeded 3,000 as of yesterday, according to the UN's human rights office.",
  "62947576b0ad1205a84c47d8dd7e49aec3d0e75c121627b2d3b02507": "At least five British soldiers have been arrested in a sting by military police on suspicion of dealing cocaine at their base.  The gunners from the Royal Artillery were hauled into custody after raids on military accommodation in Wiltshire last Tuesday.  While cases of soldiers being caught taking cocaine are not uncommon, it is rare for troops to be suspected of dealing Class A drugs.  Following the arrests, the camp at Larkhill was locked down while other troops underwent compulsory drug tests (CDTs).  Royal Military Police (RMP) officers accompanied by specialist military dog units swept through the base following a tip-off about drug dealing.  The soldiers suspected of dealing face certain expulsion from the Army if found guilty. Anyone who purchased the drug will also face court martial.  While, officially, the Army says it operates a 'zero tolerance' approach towards drug taking, junior soldiers with unblemished disciplinary records are often given a second chance.  Last night, a source at the base said: 'It was a shakedown.  'The RMPs clearly had some good intelligence on what was happening and had come prepared. Afterwards, everyone was getting CDTed. You couldn't get off camp without being tested. Nobody was being let out otherwise.  'The officers are furious, the suggestion that their soldiers are dealing drugs when their backs are turned has made them livid.'  Last night, the Ministry of Defence confirmed the dramatic events last week. A spokesman said: 'A number of soldiers at Larkhill Garrison were arrested by the Royal Military Police on April 26, 2022.  'As the matter is the subject of an ongoing Royal Military Police investigation it would be inappropriate to comment further.' This is the latest drugs scandal to hit the Royal Artillery.  Last year the Daily Mail revealed how ten soldiers from the Royal Horse Artillery, which is part of the same Corps, were booted out after failing drug tests.  Their commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Simon Harris won praise for his hardline stance when it emerged he ordered the troops to be driven hundreds of miles to the nearest available drug testing centre after he suspected them of misusing illegal substances at a weekend party on their camp.  Had he waited for a closer testing facility to reopen on the Monday morning the drugs may have been flushed out of their bodies.  Those given their marching orders included two female soldiers. The wider Army has suffered a series of drug scandals in recent years.  In 2021, a record 19 members of the 1st Battalion, the Yorkshire Regiment, failed the same CDT after they had taken cocaine and cannabis.  Also last year, ten soldiers from the Yorkshire Regiment's 2nd Battalion were caught taking cocaine at the Cypriot resort of Paphos near the base on the island. They were confronted by drug testers on their return to camp. The Royal Navy has also suffered its share of drug scandals with a nuclear submarine having been dubbed 'HMS Sex and Cocaine' after a breakdown in discipline among sailors.  In 2017, 17 members of HMS Vigilant were booted off the vessel after traces of the Class A drug were found in their bloodstream#.",

Both were thrown together at school as teenagers where they became close friends... before losing touch.  So when Olya Robertson heard Inna Horbenko was hiding in a basement in Ukraine as missiles rained down, she did not hesitate to offer her old schoolmate shelter in the British home where she now lived.  The pair met aged 13 at school in the town of Novy Urengoy in western Siberia.  Mrs Robertson later met and married her financial adviser husband Jack, 57, in 1995 while studying English in Norwich.  While a reunion in 2005 was the last time the friends had met in person, they had kept in contact on social media.  Now Mrs Horbenko and her son have moved into the Russian's four-bedroom home in Norfolk.  Mother-of-three Mrs Robertson, 48, said: 'I am Russian and Inna is Ukrainian but it makes no difference. You do what you can to help your friends.  'Like many other Russian people, I am totally against president Putin and his invasion of Ukraine. Inna and I were close friends as teenagers and were in a group of about six girls who hung out together.  'Now I am just happy that I can help her when she is in need.'  Mrs Horbenko, 48, said: 'I am so grateful to my friend and the UK for supporting us. In the back of my mind, I am still worrying about my daughter, my country, our home, cat and dogs and my husband, who is not allowed to leave the country.'  She is learning English in the hope of getting a job and trying to find her son Yehor, 13, a place at a school. She went to university in St Petersburg before returning to Ukraine.  Mrs Robertson said: 'When the war started, I told Inna that I was scared for her. 'When the Government said they would allow Ukrainians to come in, I asked her if she wanted her son to stay with us.'  They then agreed Mrs Horbenko should also come. She and Yehor, who had been sheltering in their Lviv basement, managed to get a lift to Poland.  The accountant left her dentist husband Valerii, a Ukrainian army volunteer, and daughter Anastasia, who is at a Kyiv military academy.  They met the Robertsons at the border on March 24 and their visas were granted on April 13.

  "60eebafa38ac75be8a24c3c138d11352a84eccb1b17214b1df700162": "Senior ministers tonight dramatically ramped up pressure on Durham Constabulary to fully investigate allegations Sir Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner broke Covid rules.  After a string of revelations in the Daily Mail, three Cabinet ministers went public yesterday to say Sir Keir clearly had questions to answer over the so-called 'Beergate' affair.  One suggested 'no reasonable person' now believed the Labour leader's account of the event and asked how Durham Constabulary could.  And although Home Secretary Priti Patel has declined to intervene, her allies voiced frustration today about the lack of action from the force.  Sir Keir was caught on camera swigging beer with colleagues at a time when England was slowly emerging from lockdown last year, when indoor socialising was banned. Labour insisted it was a 'work event'.  But last week, after being presented with video evidence by this newspaper, it was forced to admit deputy leader Mrs Rayner was at the gathering - something it had denied for months. The Mail's revelations have also raised a string of other questions over Labour's account of the event, particularly over whether Sir Keir returned to work after drinking beer at 10pm.  Durham Constabulary has so far declined to launch a full investigation - apparently deciding to clear Sir Keir of any offence on the basis of video footage it reviewed in February.  But pressure is now mounting on the force to begin a full probe.  Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: 'Keir Starmer clearly has questions to answer on this affair, which isn't going away.  'Given his unrelenting focus on events in Downing Street, it is only right that he observes the same standard in regard to scrutiny that he applies to the benches opposite. Otherwise, he leaves himself open to the charge of hypocrisy.'  Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said: 'We are expected to believe that a curry and beers arrived for about 30 people at 10pm, and this was a break for a work meeting?  'No reasonable person believes Labour's story, so why do Durham police and what were they told?'  Tory chairman Oliver Dowden said: 'The revelations that have come to light in the past week clearly do not stack up with his [Sir Keir's] account of events.'  While Miss Patel has declined to intervene, as the police are operationally independent, her allies voiced frustration about a lack of action from Durham Constabulary.  A Home Office source said: 'Taxpayers across the UK expect the law to be enforced equally.  'It's clear Starmer has more questions to answer in light of recent revelations.'  Sir Keir faced questions yesterday about the Durham Miners Hall gathering on April 30 last year during a visit to Worthing, East Sussex, ahead of Thursday's local elections.  He was also grilled on suggestions there could have been as many as 30 attendees.  An Indian restaurant delivery driver claimed he had dropped off 'quite a big order' at the hall, estimating there were 'probably about 30 or so' people there, but after the Mail made further inquiries, he said he had no recollection of the delivery.  Asked if he had gone back to work after drinking beer at 10pm, Sir Keir said: 'We were working, it was days before the election. We paused for something to eat, there was no party, no rules were broken. There's nothing I can add to that.'  Tory MPs yesterday accused Sir Keir and Mrs Rayner of hypocrisy for calling for Boris Johnson to face a police probe or the sack over Partygate, whilst refusing to accept they should be treated the same.  Mark Jenkinson said: 'They're quick to call for police investigations and resignations, unless it's into their own behaviour.'  His colleague Chris Clarkson said: 'Week after week we had the same pained sanctimonious expression from Keir Starmer at the dispatch box as he banged on about parties, when all along he knew he'd been at one himself and so had his deputy.'  Last month Mr Johnson was fined by the Met Police for attending a No 10 event on his birthday in 2020.  Richard Holden, Tory MP for North West Durham, wrote to Durham Constabulary a week ago asking it to reconsider a probe in light of the Met's fine.  Step 2 rules in England from April 12 to May 17 last year stated: 'You must not socialise indoors except with your household or support bubble.'",
  "139b67619858d8a771a6d41e89ac59e2e99ad9471063374afc2af370": "Vegetarian children are nearly twice as likely to be underweight as their meat-eating peers, a study has found. Researchers led by St Michael's Hospital in Toronto, Canada, tracked 9,000 children -- including 250 vegetarians --  from about their second to fifth birthdays. Those who stuck to a plant-based diet had the same height, body mass index (BMI) and nutrition on average as those who ate meat. But they were also up to 94 per cent more likely to be underweight when their BMI was calculated. Scientists suggested this may be because a plant-based diet does not contain enough nutrients for growing children. But they added it might also be due to more Asian children being vegetarian, who BMI is more likely to show as being underweight. Being a vegetarian has never been more popular in the U.S. in modern history, with about 10 percent of people now saying they only eat plant-based foods -- compared to two percent as many decades ago. Many health experts say it is perfectly possible to get all the nutrients you need with a 'well-planned' vegetarian diet. But some European countries have warned against giving youngsters a vegan diet -- which excludes eggs and milk -- because of the risk of malnutrition.  The below is what vegetarians should eat to remain healthy. Doctors say that contrary to popular belief, most vegetarians get enough protein and calcium in their diet: Source: NHS In the study -- published in the journal Pediatrics -- scientists used data from the Canadian TARGet kids! study, which monitored the children up to 2019. There was an even gender-split among participants, and nearly two-thirds were of European descent. Out of the almost 8,700 youngsters who ate meat, about 78 percent (6,600 people) had a healthy weight. This was similar to the vegetarian group, where 79 percent (192) were also a healthy weight. But in the underweight category, only about three percent of meat-eaters (274) were included. For comparison, a total of six percent of vegetarians (15) were marked as underweight. Dr Jonathon Maguire, a pediatrician at the hospital who led the study, said: 'Vegetarian diet was associated with higher odds of underweight weight status. 'This underscores the need for careful dietary planning for children with underweight when considering vegetarian diets.' He also suggested the results could be down to more Asian children being in the vegetarian group. Dr Maguire told CNN: 'In India, children's growth charts differ from U.S. growth charts. 'An average five-year-old girl in India is expected to weigh 17 kilograms and stand about 108 centimeters tall. In the U.S., an average five-year-old girl of the same height is expected to weigh 18 kilograms.' BMI is calculated by dividing weight by height, but experts warn it is an imperfect measure because it can't account for age, sex and ethnicity among other factors. The study also found that meat-eating children were more likely to be overweight or obese, at 18 percent of the group (1,522 people), than vegetarian ones, at 14 percent (34 people). Both groups had similar levels of cholesterol, triglycerides -- a type of fat -- and serum ferritin -- a measure for iron content. The scientists had suggested at the start of the study that vegetarians may have less iron because they are not eating any meat. The paper also included 25 children who were vegans, but this group was too small to measure against the others.",
  "7e50ea16d1afefb2849d65f28276ea11651d81d0ab7931aca1a642f0": "Former Prime Minister Tony said the West must strive to 'defeat Russian aggression in Ukraine', in a streamed interview with the New York Times earlier today. Blair, 68, spoke at length about the situation in Ukraine and the West's relationship with Russia, postulating that Russian President Vladimir Putin is 'detached from reality' and insisting Russia had misunderstood NATO's expansion in Europe. 'I think our ambition has got to be to defeat Russia's aggression in Ukraine and to secure a Russian retreat for what they've done,' the former Labour leader said. 'It's obviously in the interest of the West to make sure [Putin] is disinclined to do this ever again. Because it's been an extraordinary act of unprovoked aggression, right here on the doorstep of the European Union.' Blair claimed he told Putin the West had no hostile intent towards Russia, insisting while he was in Downing Street that he encouraged the Russian leader to 'use the vast resources of the country to build a strong country'. But Putin by 2005 had become 'absolutely obsessed' with the idea the West was against him, according to the former PM. Blair later refuted a question posed by interviewer Peter Baker, who asked whether the 2003 UK-US invasion of Iraq - an operation to which Blair was inextricably linked - set a precedent for Putin's invasion of Ukraine. 'Didn't we set the precedent for this? Aren't you responsible for at least giving [your critics] a justification?' Baker asked. Blair responded resolutely: 'Even if you're completely against what we did in Iraq or indeed in Afghanistan... Saddam Hussein started two regional wars, killed thousands of people... his people definitely want rid of him. 'It's not the same as going into a country that's never caused any problem to its neighbours, has got a democratically elected president, and trying to topple them.  'The two situations are not in any shape or form similar.' Baker and Blair went on to discuss a variety of topics related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine during the 30 minute interview, with much of the conversation focusing on Europe's dependence on Russian gas and oil. Blair praised European leaders for taking steps to limit their energy dependence - but warned the rapid switch away from Russian supplies would lead to economic hardship. He also claimed he'd spoken with Barack Obama about pulling away from Russian energy after the annexation of Crimea in 2014.  'The energy transition in Europe is going to be very real. We should have done it after Crimea. I remember at the time arguing having conversations with people in the Obama administration about it... But then, you know, as happens in politics, things moved on. 'For a lot of these European countries, some of them are more than 50 per cent dependent on Russian energy. So they're, they're moving from that and seeking new markets at an incredible speed and with a certain amount of internal economic pain... Now you're already facing a cost of living crisis virtually all over Europe. You've got rising prices, rising inflation.' 'You can say [EU countries] have to go further and do more, and I think they will go further and they will do more. But what they've done up to now, it's been a pretty impressive display of solidarity.' EU countries rely on Russia for roughly 38 per cent of their natural gas, while Germany - the EU's largest economy - is reliant on Russia for well over 40 per cent of its gas imports. But several nations have in recent weeks announced their intentions to quickly move away from Russia's supply, attempting to strike deals elsewhere, as part of the EU's consolidated effort to support Ukraine amid the invasion. The move has been widely praised by Ukraine and other western countries, but is certain to exacerbate rising energy costs and contribute to the cost-of-living crisis. Following the discussion about the EU's Russian energy dependence, the conversation turned to Western relations with China, the Middle East and Africa. The former prime minister, who was head of the Labour party for 17 years between 1994-2007, accused the current government of not having a clear approach to dealing with Xi Jinping and allowing foreign relations elsewhere to slip. 'With China, my view is you need strength plus engagement... because China's not the Soviet Union... Our desires should not be to prevent China becoming a major power. It will become a major power. 'I could go round the world and tell you where the West hasn't got a strategy... I don't think [we have a strategy] around the Middle East anymore. I don't think we've got a coherent strategy in relation to Africa, where China's presence is enormous. Where Russia's presence, by the way, has been growing significantly in the last decade.' Blair went on to say that British and American bureaucracy has prevented developing countries in Africa from attracting investment from the West and has led them to work with China and Russia as a result. To conclude the interview, Blair touched upon Western relations with the Middle East in particular, and laid out his desires for the development of a fresh approach to working with countries there. 'The battle in the Middle East today is not between Israelis and Arabs, Persians and Arabs, Sunni and Shia,' he said. 'It's a battle around whether the societies there will become religiously tolerant and open minded, free from an abusive relationship with religion and whether they can go towards what I call rule based economies where people work hard to do well, they can build their business, they can help develop the economy.' 'Across the Middle East, there are forces of modernization and moderation. And there are forces of what I would call regressive and reactionary politics... If you wonder what the Western policy should be, it should be to get behind those forces of modernization and moderation and to isolate the others,' Blair declared. On the question of Israel and Palestine, he said he had little confidence in the state of Palestinian politics, claiming 'there isn't a way you can get an Israeli-Palestinian peace process of any meaningful sort happening... hopefully in time a Palestinian leadership emerges that understands the only way of getting peace with Israel is to make it clear that you're in favour of the State of Israel.' Blair, a supporter of the Abraham accords, said the development of a strong relationship between Israel and Arab nations is the key to achieving peace in the West Bank. The Abraham accords were a series of US-sponsored agreements between Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain signed in 2020, which aimed to bring stability in the region by uniting the Arab states of the Gulf and Israel. It has been held up as a way of facilitating a peaceful two-state solution between Israel and Palestine, but the accords have been heavily criticised for essentially omitting Palestine from having any role to play in the resolution of the conflict in which it is involved.

Victoria Borwick, who was once the deputy mayor of London and a Conservative MP at the time of the incident in 2015, said that she wondered if the touching was some sort of 'test' to see how she would react. The 66-year-old, who was most recently an MP for Kensington, decided against reporting it because she thought it was best she 'just got on with life'. Now a Conservative campaigner and activist, Ms Borwick described how she simply moved away after the married MP put his hand up her skirt, saying that 'even his hand wasn't long enough.' She told Sky News: 'I mean, I suppose I could have spoken to the whips but I didn't. 'I felt that whinging is not in my nature and I think I just got on with life.' She explained that she 'wouldn't be the first MP' to say that there is a 'different' culture in Westminster', adding that she is pleased to hear of the inquiry set to be launched as announced by Commons speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle. Ms Borwick described how the lines of work can get 'very blurred', as people work long hours and sometimes spend entire weeks away from their families and homes.  She said: 'I can well see that if you're a long way from home, and you've got a lot of tempting opportunity around you of a lot of colleagues, you get to know very closely and those that potentially work for you, the situation can be very toxic. 'The thing is that they're in a bubble. I think that inevitably, perhaps boundaries are broken.' Ms Borwick's story comes after Westminster has been plagued with sexual misconduct allegations, with fellow Tory MP Neil Parish having admitted to watching pornography in the Commons on two occasions.  This led to his resignation as MP for Tiverton and Honiton, his constituency for over 12 years.  One minister has been accused of having 'noisy sex' in his parliamentary office, another Tory MP with allegations that he sent a 'd**k pic' to a female colleague, and another who has been given repeated warnings for his use of prostitutes. One other MP is supposed to have licked men's faces while drunk in one of the Parliament's bars. The pressure to clean up Westminster politics has risen amid the wave of claims, which have often been alleged to be booze-fuelled.  On Saturday, the Sunday Times alleged that one MP was so drunk on champagne at a parliamentary bash that they had to be escorted out. Another separate incident included a female researcher who was so drunk that she vomited in a Commons' bar, only to be found later found passed out. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has called for a review to take place into Westminster's working practices after the recent damning allegations.  In early April, Imran Khan resigned from his position as MP for Wakefield after being found guilty of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy. Not long before that, Tory backbencher David Warburton was suspended after allegations of sexual harassment and cocaine use was put against him. At the moment, 56 MPs are reportedly facing claims of sexual misconduct.  There are at least three Cabinet ministers who are understood to be among those referred to the Complaints and Grievance Scheme.",
  "96e186bd79323884def260190b76aac7b850ff8142795ec509d0e13b": "Boris Johnson has announced he wants to build a new nuclear power station every year to reduce Britain's dependence on fossil fuels - including oil and gas supplied by Russia. The surprise admission came following the Prime Minister's visit to Hartlepool nuclear power station in Hartlepool. The station, which began producing electricity in 1983, is due to close in 2024. However, Hartlepool has been designated as one of eight sites the government has set its sights on for future nuclear energy plants. The Prime Minister tweeted: 'Nuclear power stations like the one I visited in Hartlepool today are absolutely crucial to weaning us off fossil fuels, including Russian oil and gas.  'Instead of a new one every decade, we're going to build one every year, powering homes with clean, safe and reliable energy.' The government's energy security strategy unveiled last month focuses heavily on nuclear and offshore wind power.  The strategy proposes to build up to eight nuclear plants to generate around a quarter of projected electricity demand by 2050.  The ambitious plan include a target to create 95 per cent of Britain's electricity from nuclear and renewable sources by 2030 - up from 55 per cent at present. The Government hopes the strategy will make Britain a net energy exporter by the end of the decade, and help protect the country's economy from global energy price shocks.  The Prime Minister was backed by Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng in finalising the plan after weeks of wrangling, with Chancellor Rishi Sunak's objections about the cost of nuclear ultimately overruled. A source said: 'The PM and Business Secretary won on nuclear.' The strategy also includes plans to launch a licensing round for new North Sea oil and gas projects this summer to reduce reliance on imports. And it contains an ambition to double low-carbon hydrogen production capacity by 2030 to replace gas in the longer term. In March, Mr Johnson drew criticism after visiting Saudi Arabia to beg it to increase oil production, in the hope that it will would UK petrol prices and help British consumers hit by increases linked to the war in Ukraine. He was accused of going from 'dictator to dictator' to shore up UK energy supplies, with Saudi Arabia criticised for killing 81 'criminals' over the previous weekend. At the time, the Prime Minister said: 'We discussed everything that you would expect, so I raised human rights, but we also talked about what we can do to stabilise oil prices, to fight inflation, to help consumers, to help people at the gas pumps, at the petrol pumps.' The Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) has predicted that household energy bills will continue to rise until 2026 as the government continues to get to grips with securing the country's energy supply. Douglas McWilliams, deputy chairman of the CEBR, said: 'People can put up with high costs if only for a short period, but what our model suggests is, unless the Ukraine situation resolves itself, prices are likely to be high but falling for three or four years.'  Mr McWilliams said he believes it will not change at all until Britain gets a grip on its energy security, particularly for gas. 'It is a tough scenario for people to live with,' he told the Daily Telegraph, adding: 'They are going to have to get used to higher prices. They are going to have to learn to economise.'",

Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh as they say a 'truly horrific crime has been committed'. In a message on the Official Find Madeleine Campaign Facebook page on today, Kate and Gerry McCann quoted a poignant line from A.A.Milne's Winne-the-Pooh - 'But the most important thing is, even if we are apart, I'll always be with you' and  said they need closure on what happened to the toddler at the holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal, on May 3, 2007.  They wrote: 'This year we mark fifteen years since we last saw Madeleine. It feels no harder than any other but no easier either. It's a very long time. 'Many people talk about the need for 'closure'. It's always felt a strange term. Regardless of outcome, Madeleine will always be our daughter and a truly horrific crime has been committed. These things will remain. 'It is true though that uncertainty creates weakness; knowledge and certainty give strength, and for this reason our need for answers, for the truth, is essential.  'We are grateful for the ongoing work and commitment of the UK, Portuguese and German authorities as it is this combined police effort which will yield results and bring us those answers. 'As always, we would like to thank all of our supporters for their continued good wishes and support.  'It is a huge comfort to know that regardless of time passed, Madeleine is still in people's hearts and minds. Thank you.' In July 2013, Scotland Yard launched its own investigation, Operation Grange, into Madeleine's disappearance Detective Chief Inspector Mark Cranwell from the Metropolitan Police, who leads the operation, said: 'Fifteen years on from Madeleine's disappearance in Praia Da Luz our thoughts, as always, are with her family. 'Officers continue to investigate the case and our dedicated team are still working closely with law enforcement colleagues from the Portuguese Policia Judiciaria as well as the German Bundeskriminalamt. 'At this time, the case remains a missing person's inquiry and all involved are committed to doing what we can to find answers.' It comes after convicted sex offender Christian Brueckner, 44, was declared an official suspect by Portuguese authorities last month, which was welcomed by the couple. He has insisted he was having sex with woman in his camper van at time when three-year-old girl vanished, according to reports.  Brueckner claims to have been stopped and photographed at a police roadblock after driving the woman to the airport at Faro, Portugal, for a flight home the next day. The suspect says she was arrested at airport security for carrying an illegal pepper spray and is adamant Portuguese police will have a record of the events, Sky News reports. German police are said to have found a picture of the woman lying in his van when they investigated a rape charge for which the 44-year-old is now in jail. This revelation comes just days after it was claimed that Brueckner has not provided German police with an alibi. German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters, who is leading the investigation, told Sky News: 'I assume if he has anything that exonerates him that sooner or later he will share it with us and we would then check it out. What happens then, let's see. 'So far he has told us nothing, he's given us no alibi. So, we can only work on the evidence we have found so far in our investigation. And there was nothing to exonerate him.' Earlier this year, however, sources close to the case were said to have discovered that Brueckner was not at the resort in Praia da Luz the night she disappeared and was actually '30 minutes away.'  It is expected that British investigators' television programme Madeleine McCann: Investigating the Prime Suspect, will dismantle the case against the prisoner. When she vanished aged three in 2007, phone records were said to show the prime suspect near the scene, the Sun reported.    However, the new investigation has revealed that an alibi for Brueckner, who was made an 'arguido', a formal suspect, by Portuguese authorities last month, 'stacks up.' If his latest claim is true, it would contradict the evidence from mobile phone data masts, which police said shows his phone was in the village when it received a call from 7.32pm to 8.02pm. Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, say their daughter vanished between 9pm and 10pm, while Brueckner insists that he'd driven miles along the coast towards Faro by 10pm.  2007 May 3: Gerry and Kate McCann leave their three children, including Maddie, asleep in their hotel apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal.

Oscar Rodriguez Calleja, 50, was rushed to hospital after being speared in the groin by a 84-stone bull called Rodillero at Fiesta del Verdejo festival in the small town of La Seca, Valladolid, northern Spain, but medics were unable to save him. Footage of the incident which happened on Sunday 1 May showed the moments before the bull dashed out of its wooden box, immediately taking a right turn towards the crowds stood behind barriers. The father-of-two was then lifted by the bull's horns as he stood behind the railings, then held up and dragged for a few seconds. Rodillero pulled Oscar while with its horns before dumping him on the floor as onlookers watched in disbelief.  His loved ones suffered panic attacks and were treated at the scene before his wife was taken to a health centre. Oscar had travelled from his home in the nearby municipality of Nava del Rey to take part in the festivities with his family.  The 50-year-old, described locally as a greyhound breeder, died after being rushed to nearby Medina del Campo Hospital for an emergency operation. The event was immediately suspended by La Seca Town Hall, which issued a statement after it emerged the injured man had lost his fight for life. It confirmed: 'A man who was gored at the start of the festivities has died. 'The fatal outcome occurred after he was evacuated to Medina del Campo Hospital with a doctor and nurse who were part of the medical team covering the event. 'We would like to express our most sincere condolences to his family and friends.' The Fiesta del Verdejo festival where the tragedy occurred is an annual event which was first held in 2008. In January a man was fatally gored by a charging heifer at a festival in Puerto Serrano in the south-west Spanish province of Cadiz. He was described at the time as only the second person to be fatally gored during an annual festival in Spain involving bulls and heifers since the start of the Covid pandemic. A 55-year-old man became the first person to die during a bull goring in Onda in the eastern Spanish province of Castellon at the end of October last year. Before the coronavirus pandemic several revellers were gored to death every year at Spanish festivals involving bulls being let onto the street including the Pamplona-style 'encierros.'

The festival takes place over four days every May and culminates with a procession through Hastings' Old Town on the May bank holiday Monday. The festival's greenery celebrates the blooming flowers and foliage which precipitates the coming of spring. Revellers lined the streets clad in green to celebrate the coming of spring with a procession of vibrant costumes walking down the streets of historic Hastings, East Sussex. References were seen to the Queen's Platinum Jubilee this summer as the parade continued through the Old Town. Costumed participants were seen wearing a myriad of colourful outfits which fit with the theme with the start of the warmer months. Jack of the Green, the central character of the festival, symbolises winter and the tradition started in the 17th century as part of May Day celebrations.  Jack was first referenced in 1770 with some historians believing that the character goes back further and has pagan roots. The legend of Jack evolved during the 1700s and eventually ended up covering Jack from head to foot in foliage, hence Green Jack then became known as Jack in the Green. The traditional festival also involves creative decorative neck or headwear from flowers and leaves which were worn while dancing around a Maypole. Many visitors to the festival this year carry on the tradition, wearing their own garlands to see the parade. Some people even put a modern twist on the festival, bring green smoke flares to create an even more spirited atmosphere. Elsewhere in the UK, traditional Morris dancers entertained the crowds for May Day celebrations.  The Ellington Morris dancers entertained visitors and locals in Henley on Thames to celebrate the arrival of summer. The team are named after the original Domesday Book designation for Maidenhead, from where the group hail. Morris dancing is thought to evolve from dancing around a Maypole - which in terms comes from the pagan custom of dancing around a tree to shove off to rival villages. They attended the Henley May Fayre as one of the few mixed-gender Cotswolds Morris dancing troupes on Monday. Morris dancers were also seen celebrating Beltane May Day on High Peak in Derbyshire before sunrise yesterday. Dancers performed their annual dance atop the Eccles Pike at sunrise, as part of the ancient Celtic festival Beltane, celebrated on May Day weekend. The costumes were far from traditional like those seen in Henley, with participants turning out in steampunk-inspired gear. The Easter period and springtime brings with it a host of bank holidays, with the month of May being book-ended by two alone. In fact, on the first May bank holiday, there is a special celebration called May Day. But why does the UK have a bank holiday at the beginning of May, what is May Day and how do people celebrate it? May Day is a holiday that is usually celebrated on May 1, but more recently has become aligned with the day that the May bank holiday falls on. The holiday has its roots in the Roman spring holiday of Floralia, a holiday that honors Flora, the goddess of flowers and was celebrated on April 27. According to the J Paul Getty Museum, Floralia was a precursor to the May Day celebrations. May Day also has a connection to the Gaelic festival of Beltane, which was held on May 1 or in-between the Spring Equinox and the summer solstice and celebrated the beginning of summer. In more modern times May Day has become associated with the workers' movement and in countries including the UK and Russia May 1 marks the International Workers' Day. May Day was actually banned in the 17th century in the UK during the Interregnum period. The Puritans deemed the May Day celebrations immoral due to the festivities, drinking and dancing. Parliament banned certain features of May Day celebrations such as maypoles in 1644.  However, after the monarchy was restored with the return of Charles II, many people in England celebrated and showed their loyalty to the crown by erecting maypoles. The early May bank holiday was introduced in 1978 by then Employment secretary, Michael Foot, who would then go on to become the leader of the Labour party. The bank holiday would always be on the first Monday of the month of May. This means that the early May bank holiday 2018 falls on Monday, May 7.   In 2011, there were plans to scrap the first May Bank Holiday and establish a new one in October, but they never went ahead.  Traditional May Day celebrations include dancing around a maypole and crowning a May Queen during the May Day parade. The May Queen is a girl who wears all white and usually wears a crown. Her role is to mark the commencement of the May Day festivities. ",

Driver Daniel Roberts and his daughter, Lacie Roberts, were killed when the car smashed into LyonsDen Fitness in Bagillt, Flintshire at around 2.30am on April 22.  Today, Lacie's mother, Kieley Messham, claimed Mr Roberts had drunk a large amount of alcohol before getting into the car and was drunk while behind the wheel.  'My daughter's life has been snatched away, all for a joy ride,' she said.   Police are investigating the collision and are asking the public to send in any dashcam footage.   Ms Messham paid tribute to her daughter after the tragedy, writing: 'I love her so much, I need her back. I just need her to be OK... life will never be right again.' She continued: 'I can't express in words just how amazing Lacie was, I really can't. 'She has always been the biggest wind-up merchant in our home but in the best of ways, Lacie just loved making people laugh. 'Saying that, she found herself hilarious, too. I'd do anything to hear that laugh again, literally anything. 'She had so much about her and I wish I could pour it all out but no words will bring her back home to me, and to us. 'She is loved and forever will be. I never want to not hear her name, and I'll try and keep memories of Lacie alive - whether that be crying or laughing, she will be remembered.' Aunt Louise Messham has set up a fundraising page to help Kieley, of Flint, North Wales, 'give Lacie the best send off we can'. She wrote: 'The crash killed 2 people, they were father and daughter and it also seriously injured 3 others. Our beautiful Lacie Jade Roberts has been cruelly taken from us far too soon. 'You don't expect for this to happen to your family but this time it has, we are really struggling to come to terms with it.' 'We have set up this funding page to help Lacie's mum cover the cost of a funeral for her beautiful, bubbly baby, with the prettiest green eyes you would ever see.' Louise said Lacie's father's Daniel's 'foolish actions' had left the family heartbroken. She wrote: 'Our family as you could imagine are broken and shocked at the foolish actions of Daniel that morning, the person who was meant to protect her from any harm, not endanger her life and take her away from us. 'What he has done to us as a family is beyond any pain or hurt we could ever have imagined.' The fundraising page has already exceeded its target and raised more than PS9,000. North Wales Police said at the time: 'Officers attended the scene of a single vehicle Road Traffic Collision. 'The collision occurred near the junction of the A548 with the A5026 at Bagillt, and road closures were put in place. 'Sadly, two people have died, and another three are currently in hospital in a serious condition. 'We are appealing for any witnesses or those with dashcam footage that saw a white BMW 330 saloon travelling along the A548 from the Flint direction towards Bagillt, prior to 2.30am to please contact us.'

  "d4ae91f4321d8001a9bf24eb9c52ba839bf6a0b22ef57236127bd301": "A council has told a mother-of-three she will have to move 250 miles from Cornwall to Wales to get accommodation and should treat the trip 'as a holiday' due to the local housing shortage. Rae Layton, 43, was handed a shock eviction notice by her private landlord on April 22 and was told she has until mid-July to find somewhere else to live despite living in the property the last 15 years. She signed up to Cornwall Council's Homechoice but due to increasing rent and the unprecedented interest in properties in the area, Ms Layton has been told she might have to move from the village of Ponsanooth to Cardiff. A housing officer for Cornwall council allegedly told Ms Layton that she should look at the move to Wales as a 'holiday' despite having to leave family and friends behind. She said: 'The council worker told me that my kids can look at it as a holiday. 'She didn't mean anything bad by it but it's just a horrible situation to be in. 'On the 22nd April I got an email saying she wanted us out. I get it, I get all of it. 'People should be able to go fair enough and get another rental property. But people are demanding increasing rental prices.' The ongoing housing crisis comes as Cornwall Council said there is 'an imbalance in supply and demand' that the county has never seen before. St Ives MP Derek Thomas said in December last year that around 100 families compete for every available three-bedroom home in parts of Cornwall. Covid lockdowns and the rise of flexible working saw a surge of Londoners spending a record PS54.9bn on properties outside the city last year - the highest value on record by far. However, the rush for second homes has brought misery to residents of the most popular towns, with soaring house values pricing young people out of the housing market. Cornwall is one of the most sought-after destinations for city dwellers looking for second homes in other parts of the country. The housing problem in Cornwall was accelerated during the pandemic when 'staycations' boomed. Increased demand for second homes in the beach town drove up prices even further - with the cost of rent nearing that seen in London. Homechoice, Cornwall's social housing waiting list, is currently inundated with families in need, with currently 15,000 families on it as of September 2021. Cornwall council have advised Ms Layton that she could have to move as far as Cardiff for emergency accommodation if she does not find anything by July. She said: 'My son has been in that house since he was born. I moved from pillar to post when I was growing up and I hated it. 'They've all got friends. My best friend lives two days away from me, every evening we see each other. 'There's such a big support network that I'm gonna miss. All the parents watch everyone's kids. 'At the minute, I have to send off all my paperwork. There aren't any properties. 'They want to put me in emergency accommodation, my friends been in one for six months. She's been pushed here there and everywhere. 'I think when she told me I kind of thought 'no'. I just laid there at night, thinking what would I do. 'The kids wouldn't be able to go to school as they wouldn't have an address.' Ms Layton added: 'All my friends live on my road. It's the government that are doing it, they need to change it.' A Cornwall Council spokesperson said: 'Our priority is to keep people safe, and we are working hard to find suitable emergency accommodation for all those who need it. 'We sympathise with the position that some residents are finding themselves in as Cornwall continues to face extreme pressure on the availability of housing. 'We do everything possible to keep residents within their own communities. 'The Council has established emergency accommodation and is buying and refurbishing homes to provide medium-term temporary accommodation, but the current unprecedented demand does mean that we are having to use emergency accommodation hotels. 'In a very small number of instances, we may have to offer accommodation outside Cornwall in the short term and as a last resort. 'We seek to move people back as soon as we can Cornwall and continue to offer support to help them find long-term homes.'",
  "06b0689b7e273b78708181be1577350bdd71cd4cb7472480e0c2a46e": "Neighbours have described their shock following the tragic deaths of a 'quiet couple' at their home in Lincolnshire.   Police are 'working hard to establish the facts' around the deaths of two people, named locally as Deividas Gabalis and Diana Gabaliene, who were discovered at the property on George Street in the town of Sleaford on Sunday afternoon. Emergency services were called to the home just after 4pm following reports that Mr Gabalis and Ms Gabaliene had been injured, Lincolnshire Police said. Both victims were found lifeless at the scene and their deaths are being treated as unexplained.  Lincolnshire Police said while they are investigating the exact circumstances they are satisfied that they do not need to look for anyone else and that there is no wider threat to the public.  Friends and neighbours have since expressed their 'shock' at the news today, with floral tributes and candles left at the scene, reports Lincolnshire Live.  One friend, who knew Mr Gabalis from the Moy Park plant in Anwick, said she found out about the deaths while at work. Veronika Rutkovcka, 41, said: 'It's so shocking in our town, we've never had anything like this. [Mr Gabalis] was at work on Friday.' Mrs Rutkovcka, who said she had known Mr Gabalis for four years, added that the couple were originally from Lithuania. Mrs Rutkovcka continued: 'I do not understand how something like this could happen. It's horrible.' In an update on Monday, Detective Inspector Andy McWatt said: 'I appreciate there may be a good deal of public interest and concern in relation to this tragic incident and we're working hard to establish the facts, but I want to make clear that we do not think there is any wider threat to the public.  'As soon as we can update with more information, we will.'  The force said that post-mortem examinations and formal identification have not yet been carried out for either individual, but are expected to take place later this week.  On George Street, there is a clear sense of shock among neighbours, with a small police presence still at the scene. Jennifer Cook has lived on the road for 38 years, opposite the house where the man and woman were discovered. Mrs Cook, 69, said: 'It's very shocking to hear that they've died, I didn't know them - only to say hello - they kept themselves to themselves. 'All the police arrived at about 4pm yesterday [Sunday], there were lots of police cars and vans. It's frightening really that something like this has happened.' Father-of-six Michael Trollope, who has lived on the street for three years, echoed Mrs Cook's sentiments, saying: 'They were a very quiet couple. You wouldn't know they were there.' When asked how he felt about the deaths, Mr Trollope, 42, added: 'I've not had time to think about it. 'Most of the people round here are vulnerable, there's a lot of old people and it could be frightening for them.' A number of lines of enquiry are being pursued by investigating officers and members of the public who may have information have been urged to contact police. ",
  "724a85ad5985173f6dbf91f67413616ca4281298ff14124372276e67": "What a difference a month can make. Once an uncontroversial British cross-Channel ferry service, P&O Ferries appears to have dramatically fallen from grace in just several weeks. And as its European Causeway vessel drifted out to sea for more than an hour last week, it appeared to be a fitting metaphor for the ferry operator's current troubles: Adrift. The P&O Ferries drama began with the mass layoff of hundreds of experienced seafarers and their replacement with untrained PS5.50-an-hour agency workers on March 17. But it has seen mass protests by furious workers, weeks of gridlock on the roads to the Port of Dover, and unions and politicians of the Left and Right effectively hand-in-hand demanding retribution. And for many, beleaguered CEO Peter Hebblethwaite became not just the lightning rod or symbol of the perceived injustice meted out, but its very embodiment. At the most intense stage of the scandal, the millionaire told MPs while giving testimony at a committee session in the House of Commons that the company had broken the law by sacking the staff without consulting trade unions. His unwillingness to answer whether he could live on the PS5.50 an hour he was paying the new workers was just too much for some MPs to stomach.  So just how did P&O Ferries end up in this position of crisis? For the 786 turning up to work on March 17, they could hardly have suspected that they would soon be without a job. Indeed, just four months earlier, a company promo video proudly highlighted the benefits of working at P&O, declaring: 'It's not just a job, it's a career... It's family.'  But in an online Zoom call at 10.30am that Thursday morning, staff were stunned to discover they were all being made redundant with immediate effect. A senior executive explained to staff that the company's financial situation was less than ideal. P&O Ferries Holdings had lost nearly PS39million in 2019 and in 2020, when Covid first broke out and prompted governments to impose unprecedented curbs, it lost nearly PS86million. That day, the company said that losses for 2021 had increased to an extraordinary PS100million, and - though they losses were covered by its parent company DP World - they were 'clearly not sustainable in the future' and that nearly 800 seafarers would be put out of work. They would be replaced by a 'third party crew provider', which turned out to be PS5.50-an-hour foreign agency workers. Also announcing that sailings would be suspended 'for the next few days', the executive told staff: 'As you may be aware the business has been struggling financially for the last few years and has lost around PS100million each year for the last two years. 'Whilst these losses have been covered by P&O Ferries' parent company, DP World, it's clearly not sustainable in the future. The business cannot continue to operate like this so it has had to consider a range of different options in order to drastically reduce costs. 'These circumstances have resulted in a very difficult but necessary decision to restructure P&O Ferries' workforce and operations in order to protect the future of the business. This was only taken after seriously considering all available options. The company has made the decision that its vessels going forward will be primarily crewed by a third party crew provider. 'Therefore I'm sorry to inform you that this means your employment is terminated with immediate effect on the grounds of redundancy. Your final day of employment is today.' Just hours after P&O Ferries announced the mass redundancies, hundreds of sacked staff held protests and refused to disembark ships at ports in Dover, Hull and Northern Ireland. Dutchman Eugene Favier, the captain of The Pride of Hull, sealed himself and his 141-strong crew inside the huge vessel using maritime law, refusing to let anyone aboard. Agency workers had already been waiting at docksides ready to board the ferries, but P&O Ferries was left red-faced after its existing employees refused to leave the docks over the firm's decision. To help force its staff to disembark, P&O Ferries allegedly 'illegally' hired 16 handcuff-trained officers from a private security firm, with the company telling them the job would last a week and be paid at PS14.50 an hour. Emails sent to security guards drafted in beforehand showed bosses describing a 'fairly high profile task' to be dealt with over the course of a week in Dover. Those enlisted were told to bring 'cuffs and utility belts' but were informed they would 'not need body armour for this task'. The crew of the Pride of Hull eventually left the ship after the standoff came to an end at around 6pm that day. Dozens of employees gathered outside the union's Dover office ahead of a protest where fired ferry workers, armed with banners and flags saying 'Stop the P&O Ferries jobs carve up', clashed with motorists after blocking a road close to the port of Dover. A lorry driver trying to enter the port began shouting and beeping at those in the road, before being told 'we're not moving'. One of the protesters, who had worked for the company for decades, later said: 'I refuse to move from this road, all this service for nothing. The police will have to take me away.'  In the immediate aftermath of the scandal, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps took aim at P&O Ferries in a scathing letter sent after the sudden sacking of 800 crew members while Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng slammed the firm for axing staff after taking 'millions of pounds in furlough payments'. Mr Shapps said the company had only let a 'very small group' of officials know about the decision the night before, meaning it was 'far too late' for the Government to intervene. He said he had instructed the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) to carry out inspections of all P&O Ferries vessels before they return to sea to check the new crews the company has 'rushed through' are safe.  Mr Kwarteng said the way staff were treated was 'appalling' and that P&O Ferries had 'lost the trust of the public' and given the business a 'bad name'. However, both letters were addressed to P&O Ferries chairman Robert Woods who, according to company records, resigned from the role on December 21. It is understood Mr Woods was still listed as chairman on the company website. Mr Shapps and Mr Kwarteng then wrote letters to the actual chairman, ITV News reported. In the letter addressed to Mr Woods, and initially posted to Twitter, Mr Shapps said: 'Following the Maritime Minister's call with your company yesterday, I am writing to express my anger and disappointment about the action that P&O took yesterday to make 800 seafarers redundant without notice and without consultation. 'The lack of engagement, of prior notice, or of any empathy whatsoever for your workers that P&O demonstrated yesterday was completely unacceptable. 'Seafarers make a huge contribution to this country, and many have dedicated years of service to P&O, and I was frankly staggered yesterday at the way you dismissed them with zero respect. 'While I accept this was a commercial decision for P&O to take, I was also deeply concerned at the way in which this decision was communicated to the Government. 'Although I understand you told a very small group of officials the evening before the announcement, this was clearly far too late for the Government to engage in something you had obviously been planning for some time and were determined to force through.' For the next week, the news was split between Putin's illegal war in Ukraine and the furious denunciations of P&O Ferries' illegal decision to lay off hundreds of workers without notice.  Meanwhile, chaos erupted at UK ports with aid prevented from reaching Ukrainians and lorry drivers left waiting for hours. As protests broke out in ports around the country, the cheap foreign agency staff replacing the fired seafarers arrived for work. Around 20 members of the replacement crew who were drafted in following the sacking scandal were pictured being shown around a ship docked in Hull, where eyewitnesses said they were taught about pieces of equipment onboard.  More than 200 miles away, the groups donned orange overalls and were escorted around by a skeleton crew of P&O Ferries staff aboard the Pride of Kent.  The new workers had no contact with those stationed on shore and the gang plank gate remained locked.  As well as running passenger services, the company is a major freight carrier on the crucial Dover to Calais route. This handles a third of the goods trade between Britain and the EU, including large amounts of perishable food. A lorry driver trying to enter the port began shouting and beeping at those in the road, before being told 'We're not moving'. Another driver, Richard Gamby, said: 'I understand what they're doing but I want to get home - I've been up since four.'  'Tory hating' union members turned on Dover's Conservative MP Natalie Elphicke when she came out to support them over P&O Ferries' 'jobs massacre'. Mrs Elphicke even held a 'save Britain's ferries' banner at the event with Labour's hard-left former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and amid calls for the Dubai-owned business to hand back their PS10million furlough cash, she said: 'We supported them with furlough and they should be backing Britain and backing Dover'. But when she began speaking on TV about the sackings being 'devastating' for the Kent town, union activists started screaming: 'We hate Tories, we are the Tory haters', 'shame on you', 'you're on their side' and 'you voted for fire and rehire', forcing her to abandon her interview. One protester confronted her saying: 'Tory anti-union laws allow bosses to get away with this'. The Conservative MP replied: 'Nonsense, it's bad business behaviour' before she walked off as others yelled in her face. The picket then marched on the docks, where police are parked at the entrance to the freight terminal and three P&O ferries - Pride Of Canterbury, Pride of Kent and Spirit of Britain - all remain docked. There appeared to be agency staff already working on the ships with security guarding the gangplanks. There were also protests in Hull, attended by Ed Miliband, as well as in Liverpool and Belfast, where police guarded the ports as union members called for ministers to 'sink P&O' by nationalising it. RMT organiser for Yorkshire and Lincolnshire Gaz Jackson said the crew were 'absolutely devastated' and described P&O Ferries's actions as 'unacceptable' and 'unforgivable'. He told reporters at King George Dock in Hull: 'I got a phone call at 8am saying something was going to happen at P&O Ferries, I got on board and spoke to the captain and we said we've got to lift the gangway until we've got an agreement. 'At 11am ratings and officers were informed there was going to be a pre-recorded Zoom meeting. After that two to three-minute call all the crew were made redundant.' Labour urged the Government to publish the legal advice it has received on whether P&O Ferries broke the law when it laid off staff. In response, Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden voiced 'revulsion' at the firm's 'sharp practices' saying it had displayed no 'empathy whatsoever' towards workers.  He stressed that the Government is looking at whether the abrupt sackings were legal and reviewing contracts with the company. In a round of broadcast interviews from Blackpool - where the Tories are holding their Spring conference - Mr Dowden said of P&O Ferries: 'I think they should be in no doubt that the Government is considering very closely its relationship with them.' He told Times Radio the Government was trying to establish whether the mass sacking was legal. 'That is why the Transport Secretary (Grant Shapps) has asked the Insolvency Service to look at the notification requirements, for example, and see whether further action is appropriate,' Mr Dowden said. 'All of us feel, frankly, a revulsion at the kind of sharp practices from P&O.  There has been a complete lack of engagement, a lack of prior notice or indeed any empathy whatsoever for the workers.'  Mr Shapps urged Britons to 'vote with their feet' and avoid P&O Ferries. He told the House of Commons: 'I expect many customers, passengers and freight will quite frankly wish to vote with their feet and where possible choose another operator'. The minister was joined in his condemnation of the scandal-hit ferry operator by his opposite number, shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh, who said that the minister should 'immediately begin criminal action' against the firm. Ms Haigh said that the firm felt it could act 'with impunity when it comes to respecting our employment rights'. Business Minister Paul Scully told the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme: 'If they have flouted the notification law where they are supposed to tell the Secretary of State when they are going to make more than a hundred people redundant, then there are criminal sanctions involved in that, including an unlimited fine. 'We have reserved the right to approach the prosecuting authorities should that be the right thing to do.' Mr Scully said Mr Shapps was reviewing all Government contracts and dealings with the company and its owners, DP World, adding: 'They need to realise that the relationship between the companies and the Government has changed as a result of their absolutely callous [conduct]'. Asked if that could include a PS25million subsidy to DP World to help develop London Gateway as a freeport, he replied: 'We will look into all of these things as part of this.'  Conservative peer Baroness Roz Altman added: 'I think what P&O Ferries have done is absolutely disgraceful.  'I feel so sorry for those 800 seamen who were loyal to P&O who were sacked by video, escorted of their ships, no warning, and I think that the Government should think very carefully about forcing the employer to behave better, and if that means that they have to impose any kind of sanctions or warnings to them, I think that would be entirely appropriate.' Northern Ireland's Economy Minister Gordon Lyons described the sacking of the 800 P&O workers as 'disgraceful'. In a statement to the Assembly, Mr Lyons said: 'At the outset let me be clear; neither I, as a constituency representative in East Antrim or as Minister of the Economy, nor my officials in the department, were afforded the courtesy of advanced notice of the P&O announcement.  'I regard their actions as disgraceful. P&O has literally ripped up the employment rule book, and, in the process, simply discarded 800 of their loyal and most diligent workforce. Even now, I can scarcely believe how callously they behaved. 'I understand that there could be up to 50 staff from Northern Ireland directly impacted by this announcement. Many of us in East Antrim know some of the workforce. 'The stories I heard of staff being escorted off ships, by men in balaclavas, carrying handcuffs, was as sinister as it was outrageous. 'Deploying such a tactic here, in Northern Ireland, to an unsuspecting workforce is so ill-judged and shocking, our condemnation alone is simply not enough.' In a letter to Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng dated March 22, P&O Ferries' millionaire boss Peter Hebblethwaite denied breaking British labour laws because the ships are registered outside of the UK - in this case, Cyprus and the Bahamas.  He said that the 'very clear statutory obligation in the particular circumstances that applied was for each company to notify the competent authority of the state where the vessel is registered'. The chief executive wrote that notification had been made to the relevant authorities on March 17, and that no offence had been committed regarding notifying the Secretary of State. Mr Kwarteng had threatened P&O Ferries with unlimited fines, warning Mr Hebblethwaite that 'clear rules' include 'notifying in advance... the Secretary of State'. However, maritime lawyers argued that former Tory minister Chris Grayling had cleared the way for P&O Ferries to sack staff without needing to tell the Transport Secretary. Kevin Barnett, head of employment at marine law specialists Lester Aldridge LLP, claimed that laws to protect employees in Britain were amended by Mr Grayling in 2018 so that the Secretary of State does not have to be notified of mass redundancies on ships registered overseas. Mr Hebblethwaite added that the firm was 'painfully aware' of the 'distress' caused to workers and their families on being sacked without warning or consultation, but added that this course of action was taken as a 'last resort'. P&O Ferries also announced that it would pay more than PS36million in compensation to sacked staff, with 40 employees in line for payments of more than PS100,000. It said payouts would be linked to the period of service, and in some cases exceed PS170,000. The total value of the settlement is PS36,541,648, with no worker set to receive less than PS15,000, the company added.  In a statement, Mr Hebblethwaite issued a public apology for the sackings, but insisted that it was 'the only way to save the business'. He repeated this at a dramatic joint evidence session to MPs on March 24 - before admitting that he broke the law by laying off 800 staff without notice, and insisted he would 'do it again'.  Matters were only made worse when the millionaire, who is paid PS325,000 to run P&O Ferries and lives in a plush Cotswold farmhouse worth more than PS1.5million, refused to say if he could live on the new workers' PS5.50 hourly wage. Former Tory minister Chris Grayling cleared the way for P&O Ferries to sack 800 staff without needing to tell the Transport Secretary, according to a leading maritime lawyer.  Kevin Barnett, head of employment at marine law specialists Lester Aldridge LLP, has claimed that laws to protect employees in Britain were amended by Mr Grayling in 2018 so that the Secretary of State does not have to be notified of mass redundancies on ships registered overseas. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng had threatened P&O Ferries with unlimited fines, warning Mr Hebblethwaite that 'clear rules' include 'notifying in advance... the Secretary of State'. But Mr Barnett says that Mr Kwarteng is 'incorrect' on this point, telling Sky News: 'The amendment states the notification must be made to the competent authority of the state where the ship is registered, instead of the Secretary of State.' The Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 was amended by statutory instrument in February 2018. The change signed off by Mr Grayling states: '[If] the employees concerned are members of the crew of a seagoing vessel which is registered at a port outside Great Britain... the employer shall give the notification required... to the competent authority of the state where the vessel is registered (instead of to the Secretary of State).'   The Department for Transport (DfT) said in an explanatory note that the amendment was supposed to improve seafarers' employment rights. The department claimed the amendment had been supported by the unions who have led protests against P&O's actions. It added that no formal consultation was carried out before the change was made, and no impact assessment was carried out.  Darren Jones, the Labour chair of the business committee, kicked off the hearing by asking Mr Hebblethwaite: 'Are you in this mess because you don't know what you're doing, or are you just a shameless criminal?'. Mr Hebblethwaite subsequently issued a public apology to the hundreds of staff, and their families, dropped in the lurch after giving them no notice of their redundancy via Zoom. He was then accused of unlawfully implementing redundancies without consulting the trade union beforehand, after telling the group of astonished MPs: 'There is absolutely no doubt that we were required to consult with the unions. We chose not to do that.' Andy McDonald, the former shadow transport secretary, asked: 'You chose to break the law?'. Mr Hebblethwaite replied: 'We chose not to consult, and we will compensate everybody in full for that.' Mr McDonald asked: 'Do you get in your car and drive down the motorway and see the 70mph sign and say, 'That's not going to apply to me, I'm going to do 90 because I think it's important that I do that'? Is that how you go about your life?'. 'No it isn't,' Mr Hebblethwaite replied. The millionaire boss admitted that he would 'do it again', telling MPs: 'I completely throw our hands up, my hands up, that we did choose not to consult. We did not believe there was any other way to do this. We weren't viable before, and I know that if we hadn't made radical changes the business would have closed'. He also refused to answer if he could survive on PS5.50 per hour, the rate he is paying cheap foreign workers. The minimum wage in the UK for people aged 23 and above is PS8.91 per hour. By comparison, the sacked crew earned an average of PS36,000 per year. Mr McDonald asked Mr Hebblethwaite: 'That's below the national minimum wage of this country. How do you reconcile that?'. Mr Hebblethwaite insisted that the wage was 'competitive', adding: 'Where we are governed by national minimum wage, we will absolutely pay national minimum wage. This is an international seafaring model that is consistent with models throughout the globe and our competitors.' The ferry company boss offered no answer when Mr McDonald asked 'could you sustain your lifestyle?', if he was paid the same as the new workers. The Labour MP added: 'How do you expect them to be able to feed their families and pay their bills?'. Mr Hebblethwaite also told MPs that Transport Secretary Shapps was informed on November 22 last year by P&O Ferries' owner DP World that the company would be changing its business model. It is understood that Mr Shapps did talk to DP World chief executive Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem on that date, but the DfT insisted the Cabinet minister was only told the ferry operator faced challenges from competitors. Following the hearing, Mr Jones said that he was 'amazed' by Mr Hebblethwaite's evidence, adding that the chief executive 'should be fined, struck off and prosecuted'. His counterpart on the transport committee, Tory MP Huw Merriman, added that Mr Hebblethwaite should 'consider his position', telling the BBC's World At One Programme: 'It is untenable to come to Parliament to say you have decided to break the law, you have no regrets.' Prime Minister Boris Johnson claimed that P&O Ferries did break British labour laws and warned the disgraced operator that it would be criminally prosecuted. The European Causeway was impounded on March 25 in Larne, Northern Ireland by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) after suspected crew training failures. In a statement the agency said the vessel would remain under detention 'until all these issues have been resolved' by P&O Ferries.  The MCA said: 'We can confirm that the European Causeway has been detained in Larne. The vessel will remain under detention until all these issues are resolved by P&O Ferries. Only then will it be reinspected. 'Detention of ships is based on concerns over their safety and to prevent them going to sea.'  Following the news, Mr Shapps took to Twitter and said P&O would 'not be able to rush inexperienced crew through training'. He wrote: 'Following my instruction to inspect all P&O vessels prior to entering back into service, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency has detained a ship for being unfit to sail.' 'I will not compromise the safety of these vessels and P&O will not be able to rush inexperienced crew through training.'  In a letter to Mr Hebblethwaite on March 28, Mr Shapps warned P&O Ferries that its reputation is 'in tatters' as he ordered it to make a U-turn over its 'sweatshop pay' policy. The Transport Secretary vowed new laws to close a 'loophole' in national minimum wage rules exploited by the firm - a move that would ban maritime firms from British ports unless they pay crew at least the UK minimum wage. Mr Shapps said he believed Mr Hebblethwaite's position as a chief executive 'and indeed as a company director' had become 'untenable'. And he said he was giving the company 'one further opportunity' to offer 'all 800 workers their jobs back on their previous terms, conditions and wages'.  Mr Shapps wrote: 'The past week has left the reputation of P&O Ferries and, I'm afraid, you personally in tatters. 'Not only were your letters of 22 March to the Business Secretary and myself wholly unsatisfactory, your appearance at the Transport Select Committee, during which you brazenly admitted to breaking employment law, demonstrated beyond doubt your contempt for workers who have given years of service to your company. 'There is no excuse for this behaviour, and as I said publicly on Friday, I believe your position as chief executive, and indeed as a company director, has become untenable.'  Mr Shapps added: 'I will be bringing a comprehensive package of measures to Parliament to ensure that seafarers are protected against these types of actions in the way that Parliament and this Government already intended. Through that package, I intend to block the outcome that P&O Ferries has pursued, including paying workers less than the minimum wage.'  The MCA also announced that it was inspecting P&O Ferries' ship Pride of Kent at the Port of Dover, to ensure the ship is safe to go to sea without passengers or cargo.  In a statement to the Commons on March 30, Mr Shapps vowed a new law to ban P&O Ferries from British ports if crew are not paid minimum wage. The Transport Secretary told MPs he wanted to impose the tough rules 'as quickly as possible' amid the bitter row over the firm's mass sackings. But Mr Shapps conceded that the measure cannot be brought in immediately, saying he was urging ports to act before it is formally on the statute books. He also said the UK is looking at doing deals with other countries to guarantee enforcement of minimum wages across jurisdictions. These include plans to create 'minimum wage corridors' on ferry routes between the UK and other countries. And he repeated his call for Mr Hebblethwaite to quit, revealing he has written to the Insolvency Service complaining he is 'unfit to lead a British company'. Making a statement to angry MPs, Mr Shapps said he was moving 'as quickly as possible' to change the law. 'Where new laws are needed, we will create them. Where legal loopholes are cynically exploited, we will close them. And where employment rights are too weak, we will strengthen them,' he said. Mr Shapps said the Government will 'give British courts new statutory powers to refuse access to regular ferry services, which do not pay their crew the national minimum wage'. He went on: 'We will achieve this through primary legislation to amend the Harbours Act 1964. And it means that if companies like P&O Ferries want to dock in ports, such as Dover and Hull and Liverpool, they will have no choice but to comply with this legislation. 'Crucially, it means that P&O Ferries can derive no benefit from the action that they have disgracefully taken.' On April 1, criminal and civil investigations were launched into the decision by P&O Ferries to sack nearly 800 workers. Mr Kwarteng said that the Insolvency Service has started 'formal criminal and civil investigations' and that he will be 'follow this matter closely' along with Mr Shapps. The Insolvency Service said: 'Following its inquiries, the Insolvency Service has commenced formal criminal and civil investigations into the circumstances surrounding the recent redundancies made by P&O Ferries.'  The Inspector General of the Insolvency Service confirmed the investigations in a letter to the Business Secretary.  In the letter, dated April 1 and posted on Twitter by Mr Kwarteng, Dean Beale wrote: 'As you know, on 17 March 2022, a total of 786 employees were dismissed across three companies under the P&O Ferries banner.  'In your letter you asked the Insolvency Service to undertake an urgent and thorough enquiry into the circumstances surrounding the redundancies made by P&O Ferries, to determine whether the law has been complied with and consider prompt and appropriate action where it has not. 'Following its enquiries, I can confirm that the Insolvency Service has initiated both formal criminal and civil investigations into the circumstances surrounding the recent redundancies made by P&O Ferries. 'We will publish a short statement today confirming the above position and as you will appreciate, whilst these investigations are being progressed. It would not be appropriate for me to make further comment at this time. I will provide a further update in due course.' Mr Kwarteng tweeted: 'Following my letter to the Insolvency Service last week, formal criminal and civil investigations into P&O Ferries have now commenced. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps and I will continue to follow this matter closely as the investigations progress.' And Mr Shapps tweeted: 'The Insolvency Service has reviewed P&O Ferries' actions and placed it under criminal investigation for its actions. Peter Hebblethwaite stood before MPs and admitted to breaking the law, and his actions must now be scrutinised.' Meanwhile, traffic on major routes in Kent was almost endlessly being brought to a standstill due to delays in Channel crossings. On April 7, a 23-mile coastbound stretch of the M20 was closed from junction eight for Maidstone to junction 11 for Westenhanger to store thousands of lorries heading for the Port of Dover or Eurotunnel as part of Operation Brock. Disruption worsened over that weekend and continuing into that week - and the Highways England operation means freight lorries must hold on the M20 until sailings become available. The closure again caused chaos on nearby local roads amid gridlock for Dover residents. The A20 Roundhill Tunnel was shut under the Dover Traffic Assessment Project (TAP) scheme to prevent HGVs jumping the queue. Aerial photographs showed huge lines of trucks on the motorway - with one driver claiming to Kent Live that he was stuck in traffic jams for more than 30 hours. On April 11, a second P&O ferry that sails between the English town of Dover and the French city of Calais - Spirit of Britain - was detained by British officials due to a 'number of deficiencies'. The MCA said in a statement: 'The Spirit of Britain has been detained due to surveyors identifying a number of deficiencies which were grounds for detention.' At the time, Dover, the main route for road freight to mainland Europe and popular with holidaymakers going to France, was hit by truck queues of more than 20 miles, prompting some food producers to warn of the impact on exports. Airlines and airports had also struggled to process a rebound in customers, leading to lengthy queues, after many workers left the industry during the pandemic, and existing staff suffered from high levels of Covid. The chaos went from bad to worse after P&O Ferries suspended all passenger services across the Channel for Easter. The company confirmed in a tweet that it was cancelling all Channel crossings over the Easter weekend, and said it would offer alternative routes or refunds to affected travellers Announcing the cancelling of Dover-Calais services, a spokesperson for P&O Ferries said: 'We apologise unreservedly to all customers whose scheduled journeys with us between Dover and Calais have been cancelled whilst we are unable to sail.  'It is only fair and right that we make alternative arrangements for those customers, which include transferring them onto our Hull-Europoort service to Rotterdam, or booking them onto services with Brittany Ferries between Portsmouth and Caen. 'Both of these options are at no extra cost to customers - if anyone chooses either of these alternatives we will reimburse them for any additional mileage expenses incurred and as well as all meals onboard our overnight crossing. Customers will also receive a 25 per cent discount on their original fare. 'We also recognise that these options will not be suitable for everyone, therefore any customer who booked directly with P&O Ferries will be able to claim a full refund and a free trip for future travel.' In a round of morning interviews, Mr Shapps warned Britons that roads, ports and airports were likely to be 'extremely busy this weekend'. He also took aim at transport chiefs, saying he was 'concerned' that ports and airports had not managed to get 'up to strength' since the lifting of Covid measures.  Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: 'I think certainly this weekend will be extremely busy on our roads, potentially at our ports, and of course, particularly at Dover, where P&O disgracefully sacked all of their staff and then attempted to run ships that wouldn't have been safe with replacements below minimum wage. 'We know none of their ships are running at the moment. So I do expect there to be disruption, with no thanks to P&O there. 'It is also the case for the very first time that Brits are able to travel much more freely that other nations because we don't have Covid restrictions now that other places have to travel. 'People want to travel. I'm very concerned the operators, the airlines, the airports, the ports, do ensure that they get back to strength and quickly.' On April 19, reports emerge that several P&O Ferries agency staff were fired after testing positive for alcohol when they turned up for work. Seven of the new workers, who were employed to replace permanent staff dismissed by the firm last month, were relieved of their duties after breaching guidelines on alcohol consumption.  Pat Rafferty, Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC) president, said the chief executive of P&O Ferries should be 'behind bars' after sacking the seafarers via Zoom. Speaking at the annual conference in Aberdeen, Mr Rafferty said: 'There is something seriously wrong with our society when a company CEO like P&O can swan into a Westminster parliamentary committee and openly state that he broke the law - and worse still, he'd do it again. 'What that clearly demonstrates is how useless the law is. There is no deterrent to companies like P&O who are getting away with destroying people's lives.'  The agency staff returned to work on board a ferry over the limit, after leaving the ship for shore leave. They were dismissed with immediate effect by P&O, which says it has a zero-tolerance policy on alcohol. A spokesperson for P&O Ferries said: 'We can confirm that seven agency-employed seafarers who returned from shore were found to be in breach of our strict guidelines on alcohol consumption and have been dismissed with immediate effect. 'The safety of our passengers and crew is our foremost priority and we continue to operate a zero tolerance policy towards drinking whilst on duty.' On April 24, Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union general secretary Mick Lynch claimed P&O Ferries has been 'prevented from further cutting the pay of vulnerable agency crew' by 'pressure from RMT seafarers'. The firm, owned by Dubai-based logistics giant DP World, insisted no agency workers were asked to take a pay cut. The RMT received reports of agency workers at Dover being asked to sign new contracts with reduced payments, according to the BBC. Mr Lynch said: 'There are no depths to which P&O and their Dubai owners at DP World will not sink to extract the maximum profit from ferry crews operating our vital maritime supply chains. 'This is underlined by the fact that, despite this U-turn, P&O are still only paying barely half of the UK minimum wage of PS9.50 per hour. 'Ultimately, staffing ships with super-exploited agency staff is not just morally wrong, it undercuts those remaining ferry operators who do abide by union rates of pay and conditions, and undermines passenger safety. 'The only way out of this latest crisis at the ferry operator is for the Government to take over the running of P&O vessels and reinstate directly employed staff on union rates of pay.' A spokesman for P&O Ferries said: 'No agency seafarers were asked to accept reduced wages.' He went on: 'There was an administrative misunderstanding around the contract presented to one individual who appears to have been unaware of an appendix which made clear that he would be entitled to an additional PS195 a month, meaning that there was no change in his overall pay. 'There are no plans to change or reduce the wages of any of our agency seafarers and we have made clear that we will continue to comply fully with any national minimum wage obligations introduced by the UK Government.' On April 25, claims are made that P&O Ferries' ships were prevented from sailing because their new poorly paid foreign crews had been trained so badly some did not even know where the liferafts were kept. One of its ships, the Spirit of Britain, was impounded by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency on April 12 over a string of safety issues, but has now been cleared for sailing.  Travel expert Paul Charles said it was his understanding the ships had been impounded not due to actual physical deficiencies but because the new crews had not been trained well enough, with 'some not even knowing where the liferafts were'. An official inspection of another ship, European Causeway, listed an inability to deploy lifeboats or life rafts as one of 31 failures that had been identified. The boat normally operates between Cairnryan, Scotland, and Larne, Northern Ireland. On April 26, the European Causeway, which can carry 410 passengers, lost power and drifted in the Irish Sea for two hours before lifeboats and a tug were sent to rescue it. Lowly-paid staff were said to have 'gone on strike' and left the ship adrift five miles off the coast of Northern Ireland that afternoon, according to tracking website Marine Traffic, before being escorted to its planned destination at Port of Larne.  Darren Procter, of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, said the incident was down to 'inexperienced crew' as seafarers 'familiar with the ship would have been able to keep it under power'. He also claimed P&O Ferries was holding staff to the end of their contracts and refusing to pay their travel expenses if they leave early.  The European Causeway was rescued by three lifeboats and a tugboat before it regained power shortly before 2.15pm, much to the relief of passengers on board who had endured blackouts. After the ship got back to the port, a number of the new crew members asked maritime unions for advice about terminating their contracts, the Times reported.  A spokesperson for P&O Ferries said the incident had been a temporary issue and the European Causeway had travelled to Larne 'under its own propulsion'. The under-fire company restarted cross-Channel sailings under the cover of darkness overnight on April 26. The European Causeway had been detained at Larne after an initial inspection by the MCA on March 25 uncovered 31 safety failings. But along with Spirit of Britain and Pride of Hull it was later cleared to sail. Spirit of Britain began Dover-Calais sailings that night, but only for freight. Passenger services were not expected to resume until the following. Five further P&O Ferries ships were yet to pass MCA inspections. On April 27, Mr Shapps repeated his longstanding demand that Mr Hebblethwaite resign from his post as P&O Ferries' chief executive. The Transport Secretary told the Commons' Transport Select Committee 'he will have to go' and also urged the Dubai-owned company Hebblethwaite works for to repay PS11 million of furlough money. The Tory minister also insisted 'they will have to pay the minimum wage' to crews as 'inexperienced' agency staff were blamed for leaving one ship drifting in the Irish Sea, and he urged P&O Ferries to repay the PS11million it took in taxpayer-funded furlough money.  Mr Shapps said: 'There are three things that P&O will need to do to get out of this mess and I call upon them today publicly to get on and do it. 'First of all, it's completely unsustainable to have the head of P&O, the boss Peter Hebblethwaite, who came to a committee room like this and openly and deliberately explained how he sought to break the law, he actually said that was his intention and that he would do it again... He will have to go. 'Secondly, in my view, though it's a matter for P&O themselves, I think that they need to repay furlough money as well. 'It's around PS11million. I don't think it's right that having claimed that money they then sacked the workers in such a premeditated way, which they themselves admitted broke the law. Thirdly, they will have to pay the minimum wage [under new laws being introduced in May].'  In response to Mr Shapps' demands, a spokesman for P&O Ferries said: 'The actions our company took on March 17, whilst unpopular, saved 2,200 jobs and a British company. 'P&O Ferries is now a modern, dynamic, competitive and viable business which can meet customer needs flexibly in a way that has not been possible in the past. 'We call on Government to have a constructive dialogue with P&O Ferries about the future and how we get this country moving in a positive direction after two very difficult years for business. Calls for our CEO to go need to stop. 'Despite the attempts from some parties to undermine our business by creating false rumours and uninformed commentary, our morale is high and our spirit as a company is strong. 'P&O Ferries is welcoming passengers and freight customers on board its services and we will be back to full service shortly. We will also return to commercial viability soon, which is vital for our future as a business, and also for the sake of the thousands of people we employ.' A report published on April 28 found that cheaper agency workers hired to replace sacked seafarers did not know how to use life-saving appliances. A total of 23 failures on Spirit of Britain were found by MCA inspectors. Fast rescue boats were not properly maintained and oil filtering equipment was not working. There were also five deficiencies with working conditions, and five relating to fire safety systems. The 23 safety failures were listed without further details by the Paris Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), which is an alliance of 27 national maritime authorities including the UK. It stated there was a 'lack of familiarity' with the 'operation of life-saving appliances', which could relate to equipment such as rescue boats, lifeboats, life-jackets or flares. RMT general secretary Mick Lynch described the report as 'further evidence that P&O is a capitalist bandit sailing in our waters'. He said: 'The lack of care and respect P&O clearly has for safety regulations - that are designed to save lives in the event of maritime emergencies - is on a par with their appalling treatment of the loyal 800-strong workforce who were sacked last month. 'There can be no doubt that the public and haulage firms should boycott P&O Ferries on safety, security and moral grounds until the Government steps in and takes over the running of this rogue maritime operator.'",
  "61e918efa14297beed6d6cf9e88ad9960cbf64ddc55c44cfc9d71b3d": "Millions of tenants could get the right to buy the homes they rent from housing associations to help young people get on the housing ladder, it emerged last night. Boris Johnson told officials in the last fortnight to develop the proposals to help 'generation rent'. The plan is intended to give the 2.5million households in England who rent properties from associations the chance to purchase them at a discounted price. It is inspired Margaret Thatcher's scheme, launched in 1980, that allowed families to buy homes from councils.  Michael Heseltine, then the housing minister, declared that 'no single piece of legislation has enabled the transfer of so much capital wealth from the state to the people' - but it infuriated the Left, who blamed the scheme for slashing the number of council homes available to people on waiting lists.  Right to Buy, introduced by the Thatcher government in 1980, led to more than 2.5million council homes being sold at discounted rates. Although some Labour-controlled councils were opposed, the Tories argued the scheme was necessary for increasing home ownership and rewarding aspiration. The sale price of a council house was based on its market valuation, discounted initially by between 33% and 50% (up to 70% for council flats), which was said to reflect the rents paid by tenants and also to encourage take-up. The maximum discount was raised to 60% in 1984 and 70% in 1986, but by 1988, the average discount that had by then actually been given was 44%. Some 6,000,000 people were affected, with around one in three actually buying their property. Michael Heseltine, then the housing minister, declared that 'no single piece of legislation has enabled the transfer of so much capital wealth from the state to the people'. Justifying the policy, he said: 'There is in this country a deeply ingrained desire for home ownership. The Government believe that this spirit should be fostered. 'It reflects the wishes of the people, ensures the wide spread of wealth through society, encourages a personal desire to improve and modernise one's own home, enables parents to accrue wealth for their children and stimulates the attitudes of independence and self-reliance that are the bedrock of a free society.' However, many on the Left have savaged the programme, blaming it for slashing the national stock of council-owned properties and lengthening waiting lists. When Labour returned to power at the 1997 general election, it reduced the discount available to tenants in local authorities which had severe pressure on their housing stock, including almost the whole of London. However, Tony Blair's government never actually attempted to abolish Right to Buy - perhaps wary of the huge backlash that could result.  Under the new proposals, officials are also considering using taxpayer money paid out in housing benefits to help recipients secure mortgages. Downing Street believes the new version of Right to Buy would help poorer households in red wall seats, reported The Daily Telegraph.  Current Right to Buy rules lets most council tenants buy their homes at a discount.  But housing-association tenants have limited discounts and can only buy a property acquired by an association since 1997.  The plan to widen the scheme to all housing association tenants was included in the 2015 Tory election manifesto - but it failed to materialise. However, there's criticism over whether prices could still be too high and that it would not solve the housing shortage. A government source said: 'The Prime Minister has got very excited about this. In many ways it is a replica of the great Maggie idea of 'buy your own council flat'. It is 'buy your own housing association flat.'  Robert Jenrick, who was housing secretary, said: 'Conservatives must be the party of home ownership.' Right to Buy was seen as one of the flagship policies of the Thatcher government, which transformed the life chances of many former council tenants.  Its popularity among her 'aspirational' working class supporters has led to the Conservatives announcing numerous plans to widen the scheme in recent years. David Cameron's government increased the discounts available to council tenants looking to buy their homes to PS75,000 and PS100,000 in London.    The Government is desperate to find ways to make it easier for younger people to get on the housing ladder, but its plans for housing reform were left in tatters late last year after a backlash from Tory MPs.  Ministers had said they wanted to overhaul the planning system to allow 300,000 homes a year to be built, in what would have been the biggest shake-up of the system in 70 years.  The reforms would have given councils mandatory targets for the number of houses that would need to be built in each area.  Local authorities would then have been required to divide areas into three categories - protected, renewal and growth.  Protected areas such as the Green Belt would get limited development. In renewal areas, councils would be told to look favourably on development.  Applications that meet agreed local plans in growth zones would be approved automatically.  The Right to Buy scheme allows most council tenants to buy their council home at a discount.   You can apply to buy your council home if:  The maximum discount is PS87,200 across England, except in London boroughs where it is PS116,200. It will increase each year in April in line with the consumer price index (CPI). The discount is based on how long you've been a tenant with a public sector landlord, the type of property you are buying, and the value of your home.   Source: Gov.uk  Labour, which favours development of housing on former industrial 'brownfield' sites, has indicated it would oppose the legislation, describing it as a 'developers' charter'.  Meanwhile, Tory MPs had feared the new system of nationally imposed targets would lead to overheating in the South, while earmarking too little construction in the North.  Mr Johnson's attempt to relaunch Help to Buy comes as the Tories look to give a boost to their campaign for Thursday's local elections after the MP Neil Parish said he would resign as the MP for Tiverton and Honiton after admitting twice watching pornography in the Commons.  On Sunday, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng insisted Mr Johnson would 'absolutely' remain leader no matter how badly the Tories fared in the council elections. Pressure was also on Sir Keir Starmer to lead Labour to significant gains when polls in 200 local authorities across Britain. Research by Survation found Labour has a 13-point advantage in parts of England. The 46.9 per cent to 33.7 per cent margin is even bigger than the 41 per cent to 32 per cent recorded the last time the seats were contested. Meanwhile the picture in Scotland and Wales is similarly bleak in the survey for ITV's Good Morning Britain, with Labour on course to stretch its lead from what was already a high water mark. More than 4,000 council seats will be up for grabs in England, including parts of the Red Wall such as Bury, as well as Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and all 32 London boroughs.",
  "d8820fa990b30ef2e072ea33f7255b1e4f736d20bfbc1d9ec01a4c92": "London to Sydney in under 20 hours will become the world's longest direct flight as Qantas announces plans to fly non-stop from the UK to Australia from 2025 on new plans which will include wellbeing spaces for 'stretching exercises'. Qantas launched a direct flight from Perth to London Heathrow in 2017, but has now announced an order of 12 Airbus A350-1000s to 'conquer the final frontier of long-haul travel'. The non-stop flights will allow 'make almost any city in the world one flight from Australia', including London and New York. It comes after 'strong demand' for the Perth to London flights due to 'convenience and time savings', while the new fleet of aircraft will 'set a new benchmark for premium long-haul travel'. As part of the new project, codenamed 'Project Sunrise', UK passengers will be able to expect more direct flights to Australia and 'reduced point-to-point travel time'. A trial flight from London to Sydney in 2019 took 19 hours and 19 minutes.  The new aircraft will feature a seat count of 238, the lowest of its kind in service, and a dedicated wellbeing zone designed for 'movement, stretching and hydration' with complimentary water, fruit and snack bars. The first-class suites will include a private area with door, a full-size flat-screen TV, a separate bed, a recliner lounge chair, and a personal wardrobe for the cashed-up. Qantas will also renew its narrow-body jets as part of Project Winton with firm orders for 20 Airbus A321XLRs, and 20 A220-300s as its Boeing 737s and 717s are gradually retired. The first of these aircraft will start to arrive in late 2023, with the order including purchase right options for another 94 aircraft for delivery through to at least 2034. Qantas Group CEO Alan Joyce said: 'For more than 100 years, Qantas has been at the forefront of transforming the way the world travels, particularly through direct flights. Now, the A350 and Project Sunrise will make almost any city in the world just one flight away from Australia.  'It's the last frontier and the final fix for the tyranny of distance that has traditionally challenged travel to Australia. 'Our direct Perth-London flights started in 2017 and showed strong demand for the convenience and time savings from this kind of travel if the product and service is right.  'Pre-COVID it was the longest route on our network and had the highest customer satisfaction on our network. All signs point to that demand increasing post-COVID.' The first 'Project Sunrise' flights will be from New York and London, but the aircraft will also be able to operate non-stop flights to Australia from destinations such as Paris and Frankfurt. Mr Joyce continued: 'The Qantas A350 travel experience will be truly exceptional, particularly across the premium cabins. Our First and Business Class Seats will set a new benchmark for premium long-haul travel. 'The first Project Sunrise flights will be from New York and London, but the aircraft will also be able to operate non-stop flights to Australia from destinations such as Paris and Frankfurt. 'The Australian national carrier also announced the renewal of its narrow body jets as part of Project Winton with firm orders for 20 Airbus A321XLRs and 20 A220-300s as its Boeing 737s and 717s are gradually retired. 'All of these next generation aircraft - through their lower emissions, longer range, less noise and better economics - will improve how people travel around Australia and overseas.'   In 2018, before Covid firmly halted international travel, the first passengers on board the inaugural Qantas non-stop 17-hour flight from Perth to London shared their in-flight experience after the historic Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner landed at London's Heathrow Airport. The 17 hour and 20-minute journey on a plane called Emily ended a few minutes ahead of schedule at 5.02 am on Sunday after travelling 9,000 miles without stopping. Self-proclaimed 'aviation geek' Wayne Kwong was a passenger in the economy section for the 17-hour flight and shared several photos on social media detailing his journey. He shared photos of the menu, uploading an image of a chicken breast accompanied by a glass of wine. 'Specially designed meals for this ultra-long-haul flight. Tasty, filling but not heavy on your stomach! Well done Qantas,' he wrote. The legroom was spacious, and there was a 'lovely retro pillow' to help prevent knee injuries for taller passengers, Mr Kwong said. The aircraft is twice as fuel-efficient as the Boeing 747, has lower cabin noise, larger windows, improved air quality and technology to reduce turbulence. Passengers on board shared photos of the specially crafted menu, complimentary amenity bags and the self-serve pantry, loaded with free snacks and drinks. The flight was 24 per cent further than the UK's previous longest route, operated by Garuda Indonesia between Heathrow and Jakarta, which is just 7,275 miles in comparison. The inaugural trip took off with more than 200 passengers and 16 crew members, and those on board began the journey with a round of applause. The plane had 42 business class flat-bed seats, 28 premium economy seats and 166 economy seats.  Passengers were greeted with complimentary amenity bags, which included a sleeping mask, ear buds, a Qantas fleece blanket and a toothbrush.    Dinner offerings included cheese ravioli with leek and mushroom cream sauce; and chicken with red rice and roasted Mediterranean vegetables.  The meals were designed to maintain hydration, aid sleep and reduce jet lag, according to the airline. But to the dismay of many, free wifi was not available on the flight so passengers were not able to detail every moment of their trip.  Another frequent complaint was the lack of legroom. According to business class passenger Robert Williamson, a mining executive from Perth, the flight was 'was surprisingly good -- above my expectation', he told the Independent.   But economy passenger Peter Robinson, a builder from Liverpool, begged to differ.  He said the specially crafted food items were bland and 'ordinary', but admitted the flight was 'good, quicker than I thought.' After being parked at Heathrow for eight hours, the plane was scheduled to turn right back around to Perth for another non-stop 17-hour flight for a second run. Qantas Group CEO Alan Joyce, who was one of the passengers on the inaugural flight, described it as a major milestone for Australia as well as global aviation. He said: 'This is a truly historic flight that opens up a new era of travel. For the first time, Australia and Europe have a direct air link. 'The original Kangaroo Route from Australia to London was named for the seven stops it made over four days back in 1947. Now we can do it in a single leap. 'The response to the flight has been amazing, both for the attention it's received since we announced it and the bookings we've seen coming in. It's great for Australian tourism, for business travellers and for people visiting friends and family on both sides of the world.' Mr Joyce said a huge amount of work had gone into improving the experience for customers taking the 17-hour journey. He added: 'This is hands-down the most comfortable aircraft that Qantas has ever put in the sky. 'Boeing designed the Dreamliner with features to reduce jetlag, turbulence and noise. We've taken that a step further with our cabin design, giving passengers more space in every class as well as bigger entertainment screens and more personal storage. 'We've worked with the University of Sydney and our consulting chef Neil Perry to create a menu that helps the body cope better with jetlag and adjusted the timing of when we serve food to encourage sleep.'",
  "220f83598a998f9ff728bdd7db3fb8aa7e8f13a72af28531a4b72af1": "British sellers are charging up to four times the NHS price for HRT medication on eBay as they cash in on a national shortage, MailOnline can reveal. The most popular type of oestrogen gel was selling for PS40 on the online marketplace last week -- quadruple the NHS prescription charge of PS9.35. MPs have warned desperate women are being 'exploited' after it emerged over the weekend private pharmacies are also hiking up their prices. Shortages and poor planning mean thousands have been unable to get drugs to help ease menopause symptoms such as low mood, brain fog and hot flushes. It came as a US study published today indicated the menopause can physically 'reshape the brain' -- sometimes irreversibly.  MailOnline found three eBay listings for Oestrogel, a drug which is used by around 30,000 women in the UK and is particularly low in stock. One seller, based in Uxbridge, London, charged PS40 for one month's supply, and PS5.55 for postage. Another seller from Bristol listed the same 80gram pump for PS39.99 and PS4.99 for delivery.  There are fears some women could be priced out of crucial treatments just as the cost-of-living crisis bites.  Prescriptions for HRT medication have doubled in England in just five years as women and GPs become increasingly aware of the excruciating and wide-ranging symptoms of the menopause.  An increasing number of desperate women have had to ration their prescriptions or have turned to the black market or abroad. Two of the eBay listings for Oestrogel were sold and a third was removed by the seller at the time of writing.  One still had a prescription slip on the packaging and the seller claimed they had received a 'duplicate order'. MailOnline found the products online on Friday  -- the same day the Government announced a ration on some HRT products to a three-month supply. The move, which affects Oestrogel, as well as Ovestin cream and Premique low-dose tablets, is the first to address supply issues since the appointment of HRT tsar Madelaine McTernan. Those who have prescriptions longer than three months will not have to pay an extra charge. There has been a big increase in women seeking HRT, with an estimated 538,000 prescriptions issued in December, compared with 238,000 in January 2017. As a postcode lottery means many are looking online for HRT, some online pharmacies have also been found to be selling a three-month supply of Oestrogel for PS80. Prices vary wildly, however, with Oxford Online Pharmacy selling the same product for PS49.99. Pharmacy Planet is rationing its sales of Oestrogel to one-month batches due to 'limited stock', but at PS42 each. Alternatives to Oestrogel have also taken a hit as women switch to different medication until stocks are replenished. Treated.com is selling one month's worth of Estradot patches for PS32, although women can normally get a three-month supply for PS9.35 on the NHS. The Independent Pharmacy prices a three-month supply of Estradot and Sandrena - an Oestrogel alternative - at PS75 each. There is no suggestion these online pharmacies, registered with the Care Quality Commission, are handing out unsafe medicine. Labour MP Carolyn Harris, co-chairman of the UK menopause taskforce, told The Mail last week that it was 'exploitative of women'. It comes as scientists today urged women to take HRT treatments to protect against menopause-related brain changes. A team of US researchers found menopause -- when women stop having periods and oestrogen levels decline -- 'reshapes the brain' by reducing grey matter and affecting blood flood. They believe changes in the hypothalamus, which regulates body temperature, are behind hot flushes, while a drop in oestrogen interferes with energy levels in the brain, which could cause brain fog. The researchers, from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York and the University of Arizona, spotted the changes after examining brain scans from 161 women aged 40 to 65 and comparing them against 125 men of the same age.  They said taking HRT as soon as menopausal symptoms begin can protect against these changes. The findings are set to be highlighted in a new documentary presented by Davina McCall, who has raised awareness about her own battle with the menopause. It will air tonight on Channel 4.  Women are having to deal with a shortage in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) supplies amid rising demand for such treatment. What is HRT?  Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is a treatment to relieve symptoms by replacing hormones that are at a lower level as women approach the menopause. HRT can help relieve most menopausal symptoms, including hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings, vaginal dryness and reduced sex drive. What is the current situation with supply? The Royal Pharmaceutical Society (RPS) said prescriptions for HRT have more than doubled in England over the past five years, from 238,000 in January 2017 to almost 538,000 in December 2021. The Department of Health (DH) said demand for HRT has dramatically risen, with a 38 per cent increase in the number of prescription items over the last seven years. Why has demand soared? The DH said there is greater awareness around the menopause and more confidence among GPs in prescribing HRT. What is the knock-on effect of this higher demand? Acute shortages have reportedly caused women to share prescriptions, with some said to be made suicidal by the debilitating menopause symptoms they suffer without the medication. The DH said while most of the 70 HRT products available in the UK remain in good supply, a range of factors including an increase in demand has led to shortages of a limited number of products including Oestrogel. What is the Government doing about it? At the end of April, the Government announced that Vaccine Taskforce director general Madelaine McTernan had been appointed to spearhead a new HRT Supply Taskforce. Her role will involve identifying ways to support the HRT supply chain and address shortages some women face on a limited number of products, the DH said. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said Ms McTernan will 'use her excellent skills and expertise to build on the success of the Vaccine Taskforce to bolster supply of vital medicines to women across the country'. The DH also said it was issuing serious shortage protocols (SSPs) to limit the dispensing of three products in high demand to ensure women are able to access the HRT they need. These are the Oestrogel pump-pack 750mcg/actuation gel, Ovestin 1mg cream, and Premique low dose 0.3mg/1.5mg modified release tablets. The SSPs are set to expire on July 29 and are aimed at allowing community pharmacists to supply the three specified HRT products according to the protocol rather than the written prescription, without needing to seek authorisation from the prescriber. The DH said this will 'even out' distribution of in-demand products such as Oestrogel. What is the HRT taskforce responsible for? The Government said the taskforce will engage with HRT suppliers to ensure there is a good understanding of supply constraints and what is being or can be done to address them in the short and long term. It will also work with the NHS Business Services Authority to secure access to real-time HRT dispensing data in order to improve understanding of supply, demand and what is driving shortages. The taskforce will also be expected to engage with professional bodies including the Royal College of GPs, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee to support pharmacists and prescribers to ensure they respond appropriately to increased demand. What about prescription charges? The DH said it is taking action to increase access and reduce the cost of HRT by allowing women to pay a one-off charge equivalent to two single prescription charges, currently PS18.70, for all their HRT prescriptions for a year. Known as a prepayment certificate, it is intended to mean women can access HRT on a month-by-month basis, easing pressure on supply, while keeping the cost of HRT low. This system will be implemented from April 2023. Is this soon enough? Not according to the RPS, which described the timeline as 'disappointing'. Thorrun Govind, chair of the RPS in England, said: 'Delaying this move will frustrate many who already pay for monthly HRT prescriptions and will further drive health inequalities already experienced by women across the country.' She said HRT prescriptions are 'essential' but also 'a financial drain during a cost-of-living crisis' as she called for prescription charges for such treatment to be scrapped entirely in England. ",
  "4faec51408aecbda18df43f856454c03aa6b33be91d99c4b07d9ce45": "One of Britain's most wanted men has been arrested at Lisbon Airport after trying to enter the country with a forged passport.  Alleged drugs trafficker and money launderer Alex Male was reportedly held as he got off a flight from Turkish capital Istanbul.   The Portuguese Borders and Immigration Service (SEF) has confirmed a 30-year-old British fugitive was arrested on Saturday night.  It said in a statement: 'After collecting the biometric data and consulting the databases available to the SEF, a positive alert was raised about an individual in the Interpol database. 'In addition to confirming the nationality of the citizen, it was also discovered that an international arrest warrant was pending.' Male, from Weston-super-Mare, north Somerset, was named as one of the UK's most wanted fugitives by the National Crime Agency in January. Detectives revealed at the time he was suspected of using an encrypted communications platform to distribute drugs across the region.  Male skipped bail in December 2020 and reportedly fled to Spain to avoid justice. The NCA said alongside a mugshot picture of Male it released earlier this year: 'Alleged to be a regional distributor of drugs across the south west of England, buying and selling drugs and managing other distributors who operated under his instruction using the EncroChat encrypted communications network.  'He is accused of conspiracy to supply cocaine and ketamine, money laundering, conspiracy to acquire a firearm.'  It added: 'At around 6ft tall, Male has a number of distinctive tattoos including a skull on his Adam's apple and a full sleeve on his left arm with a family tree.  'Love' is tattooed on his left hand along with a swallow and he has three stars tattooed on his left wrist. 'He also has a full tribal sleeve tattoo on his right arm going onto his chest with an angel on his back and 'live' tattooed on his right hand.'  Steve Reynolds, the NCA's regional manager in Spain where Male was thought to have been hiding out, said at the time: 'Alex Male is suspected of using EncroChat to orchestrate drug deals with crime groups across the South West of England.  'This type of criminality has a devastating impact on our communities, and he needs to face justice.'  It was thought he was lying low in the upmarket Costa del Sol resort of Marbella.  But local reports in Portugal confirmed by well-placed sources said he has been arrested after flying into Lisbon from Istanbul. NCA International Liaison Officer Phil Robinson said: 'Male naively believed he could travel across international borders using fraudulent documentation and remain undetected by law enforcement.  'But he underestimated the vigilance and expertise of the Turkish border police, which enabled the Portuguese authorities to act.  'Any arrest of a fugitive is a fantastic result, even more so since Male had only recently been added to our most wanted list.   'I'm delighted he has been caught. Detective Inspector Adrian Hawkins, from the South West Regional Organised Crime Unit, added: 'The arrest of Alex Male brings an end to a long period of investigation taking place in the UK and across Europe.  'Male will now be returned to the Criminal Justice System in the UK to face the charges he ran away from.' Convicted drugs trafficker Joshua Hendry, named as one of the 12 fugitives believed to be on the run in Spain alongside Male, was held 24 hours after the January appeal was made.  He was arrested in San Pedro de Alcantara near Marbella after being recognised by an off-duty Spanish officer.  Hendry, 31, from Walton, Liverpool, was extradited and jailed for five years and three months at Sheffield Crown Court last month after pleading guilty to supply heroin and crack cocaine and to a charge of absconding.  That was on top of the 10-year sentence he was given in 2020 when he was convicted in his absence of conspiracy to supply cocaine.  Hendry began serving his original sentence after his extradition and was charged with additional drug offences as part of the same investigation and with absconding.",
  "cfe77dffb50e23fbeccc34e947a4938d3203ac90eff95bdcb2b69d7c": "Police in the City of London were today hunting for a knifeman after a man was stabbed to death near St Paul's Cathedral last night. The victim was given CPR by paramedics at the scene in the centre of the capital last night after being found seriously injured shortly before midnight. He was taken by ambulance to Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel but died from his injuries, and detectives are now trying to establish what happened. Police set up a cordon in the area at the junction of St Martin's Le Grand and Gresham Street and have also taped off a car outside the Lord Raglan pub. Forensics teams have been scouring the area for clues this morning, and City of London Police confirmed they were investigating but no arrests had been made. Assistant Commissioner Pete O'Doherty said: 'City of London Police were called to reports of a stabbing in Gresham Street, EC2V, at 11.30pm on May 1. 'Officers found a man suffering from serious injuries and carried out CPR at the scene before he was taken to the Royal London Hospital where he later sadly died. Enquiries are ongoing and no arrests have been made at this time'. The victim's age is not known. A London Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'We were called at 11.27pm on May 1 to reports of an incident in Gresham Street, EC2. 'We sent an ambulance, a medic in a response car, an incident response officer and an advanced paramedic.  'We treated a man at the scene and took him to a London trauma centre but, sadly, he died.' The attack happened less than 24 hours after a man aged in his 30s was stabbed to death in Greenwich with police called to that scene at 2.15am yesterday. The man was taken to hospital following the stabbing in South East London but died soon after, and British Transport Police are investigating. No arrests have been made.",
  "a48106fe9f93feda21a23a0dcbed8136df3845feafd8961a21acac5b": "The number of migrants crossing the Channel to reach the UK this year could top 7,000 by the end of the day. The first five months of 2022 have seen last year's number of arrivals triple, as asylum seekers continue to arrive on British shores, adamant that Priti Patel's plan to send them to Rwanda won't stop them. Dozens of those making the perilous journey from Calais and Dunkirk told the Care4Calais charity that they were still prepared to take their chances. 'I'm willing to risk it,' said one. 'Everyone is scared in the camp but I don't think it will affect them [the decision to cross the Channel].' It comes as more migrants travelled this morning as the weather improved - showing Nigel Farage was right to say high wind was the reason behind the recent pause in crossings rather than asylum seekers being scared away by Priti Patel's planned policy to fly them to Rwanda for processing.  The former Brexit Party leader filmed himself on a boat in the water today, in which he claimed 'there have been spottings all over the place this morning', on what he described as 'another huge day'. The group were this morning pictured being brought into Kent on board the Dover Lifeboat after rescue crews responded to an incident in the water in the early hours. That came after 254 people made the perilous journey yesterday, following an eleven day hiatus. It takes the number to have been intercepted so far to 6,947 this year in 211 incidents, while last year a total of 28,526 migrants crossed the Channel in 2021 - significantly higher than the 8,410 who arrived in 2020. The recent stoppage in crossings was being hailed by some Tories as an early victory for Home Secretary Priti Patel's much-publicised new scheme. But Mr Farage said last week the lull was instead the result of the weather conditions, warning there would be an influx once again as the seas became calmer.  The Ministry of Defence took over control of migrant operations in April, when the Government also announced controversial plans to send some of those making the cross-Channel journey to Rwanda. The Government's Nationality and Borders Bill - dubbed the anti-refugee Bill by campaigners as it makes it a criminal offence to knowingly arrive in the UK illegally and includes powers to process asylum seekers overseas - became law on Thursday. Last month, Home Secretary Priti Patel signed what she described as a 'world-first' agreement with Rwanda. The deal will see the east African nation receive asylum seekers deemed by the UK to be inadmissible, having arrived 'illegally' under new immigration rules, but it has been met with criticism and is already facing legal challenges. It comes as Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said today that the UK needs to work closer with France to solve the migrant crisis. Speaking on the campaign trail in Worthing, he said: 'Nobody wants to see anybody making that perilous journey across the Channel and everybody wants to crack down on the criminal gangs that are driving this. 'The best way to do that is to have an international co-ordinated criminal response. I have worked on international criminal organisations before when I was director of public prosecutions. 'I know what can be done if you've got teams working together across Europe all the way along those routes absolutely bearing down on these criminal gangs and working very closely with the French authorities as well.' Meanwhile, the French National Assembly member for Calais has warned crossings will continue to pick up in the coming months. Pierre-Henri Dumont told BBC Radio 4's The World At One programme: 'We are going to the summer so we will have less waves and less danger for the smugglers. So we will have more and more people going to cross.' Mr Dumont said there was evidence that UK Government plans to process asylum applications in Rwanda was encouraging migrants to attempt the crossing before these measures took effect. 'From what I heard from the migrants, it seems that the news of the new legislation in the UK with Rwanda gives the smugglers the availability of new commercial arguments (to) the migrants to urge them to cross quickly for them not to be sent away because of this new legislation.' Mr Dumont said that he did not believe the measure would deter people from trying to reach the UK. 'When you leave your country because of flood, because of starvation, because you are not afraid of being hauled and sent back to another country, at least if you have a chance you will try,' he added. And a Conservative MP has said it is too early to know if the Government's plan to process asylum claimants in Rwanda will deter migrants from attempting the Channel crossing. Following the latest influx on Sunday and Morning, Tim Loughton, a member of the Commons home affairs committee, said while more arrivals could be expected, the Rwanda scheme represented a practical attempt to tackle the problem. 'They are depressing scenes and they are going to get worse,' he told BBC Radio 4's The World At One programme. 'It may seem a very robust, extreme scheme, but it is the first thing that has actually been put forward that would actually practically do something about this problem. 'People in the south and up and down the country are just sick and tired of these people smugglers making a fortune out of human trafficking, this misery coming across the Channel. 'The Rwanda scheme is an attempt to do something practical about it. But is very early days - it was only announced three weeks ago and it hasn't started yet.' Minister for Justice and Tackling Illegal Migration, Tom Pursglove MP, has said: 'The rise in dangerous Channel crossings is unacceptable. 'Not only are they an overt abuse of our immigration laws but they also impact on the UK taxpayer, risk lives and our ability to help refugees come to the UK via safe and legal routes. Rightly, the British public has had enough. 'Through our Nationality and Borders Bill, we're cracking down on people smugglers and fixing the broken system by making it a criminal offence to knowingly arrive in the UK illegally and introducing a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for those who facilitate illegal entry into our country.' UK officials, including a Border Force vessel, escorted seven small boats of men, women and children into Dover Harbour at around 12.30am on Sunday. The last migrants to arrive at the port were a total of 263 across seven small boats on April 19 - and Ministry of Justice data revealed not a single adult or child made it across since. Last week, Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen said that the drop to zero was evidence that Home Secretary Priti Patel's scheme, which will see asylum seekers sent 4,000 miles to claim refugee status from Rwanda, is 'working already'. Mr Bridgen, the MP for North West Leicestershire, tweeted: 'Priti's migrant policy is working already. No illegal migrant crossing for a week and no income for people traffickers, freeing up civil servants to work on Ukrainian evacuees. We should offer the illegal migrants already here the option of returning to France or going to Rwanda.' But Mr Farage told GB News: 'There are some saying Rwanda is working, it's a success because virtually no migrants have come now for the last six or seven days. Believe you me, I know this subject. 'That is nothing to do with the prospect of being shipped off to Rwanda. It's because there has been a persistent, strong, north-easterly wind in the English Channel. When it gets calm again, the boats will continue to come.' Up to 300 military servicemen, Navy ships and surveillance drones are being deployed to the Channel after the Armed Forces took control with the Navy assuming Border Force's responsibility for intercepting migrant boats. An RAF Wildcat helicopter is now the key military asset in the air and is being used to carry out a final 'sweep' of the Channel at the end of each day to ensure all migrants - and their dinghies - have been recovered. The helicopter is being aided by RAF drones operated out of Lydd Airport in Kent. Soldiers and airmen are also now being based at Dover to help UK Border Force staff with initial processing, and the military are able to issue directions to civilian staff of the UK Border Force, whose ships are remaining part of the Channel taskforce. Seven ships including HMS Tyne, plus smaller boats and a helicopter are being made available to patrol the sea and coastline, so Border Force staff can be freed up for processing migrants once they arrive on land. More than 6,500 migrants are thought to have arrived in the UK this year so far after crossing the Channel. In 2021 some 28,526 migrants reached UK shores aboard dinghies and small boats - up from 8,417 in 2020. The total number of migrants arriving so far this month has been 2,143 across 58 small boats, although the final day of arrivals to the present date was on April 19 when 263 were intercepted across seven small boats.   In March this year, 3,066 people made the crossing. That was nearly four times the amount recorded for the same month in 2021 (831) and more than 16 times the amount for 2020 (187). It was also the fourth highest monthly total recorded since the start of 2020, behind July (3,510), September (4,652) and November (6,869) last year. The figures for April 2022 mean the total number of migrants to arrive so far this year is 6,693 across 204 boats. Some 1,425 of these had made it across since the Royal Navy took over control of migrant operations in the Channel on April 14. Last month, the UK's former Border Force chief Tony Smith told the Daily Mail that more than 100,000 Channel migrants will reach Britain this year. Backing the Government's asylum deal with Rwanda, Mr Smith said: 'There comes a point where we need to get a grip of our border and stop the boats. 'The numbers are going up, a fourfold increase already this year - 28,500 last year,' he added. 'That's going to be over 100,000 this year just by migrant boats alone.' Mr Smith's prediction would be nearly 12 times the level seen in 2020, 54 times that of 2019 and more than 300 times that in 2018. In January, it emerged that the Home Office had produced official papers warning that 65,000 migrants could cross this year.  A Government spokesperson said: 'The rise in dangerous Channel crossings is unacceptable. Not only are they an overt abuse of our immigration laws but they also impact on the UK taxpayer, risk lives and our ability to help refugees come to the UK via safe and legal routes. 'This week, the Nationality and Borders Act completed its passage through Parliament.  'Through this landmark legislation, the Government is cracking down on people smugglers and fixing the broken system by making it a criminal offence to knowingly arrive in the UK illegally and introducing a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for those who facilitate illegal entry into our country.'",

Katie Kenyon, 33, was last seen getting in a silver Ford Transit van in Burnley on Friday, April 22, which was then driven 17 miles into the Ribble Valley. Her ex-boyfriend, Andrew Burfield, 50, from Burnley, appeared at Preston Crown Court charged with her murder and is due to face trial on November 14.  Friends, family and wellwishers have now raised more than PS14,000 to pay for Ms Kenyon's funeral.  In a statement on the JustGiving page, her family said they wanted some of the money to help Katie's children.  'On Friday April 22, our heartbreaking nightmare began when our Katie was taken away from her children and family far too soon,' they said.  'We as a family are putting together this JustGiving page for Katie to have the best send-off that Katie deserves & for Katie's son and daughter & their future to fulfil Katie's dreams she had planned with her children. 'As we know you all want to help, this would be the most appreciated way. Any donations will be truly, gratefully received.  'Thank you for all your kind words and support. We know you're all behind us.'  Meanwhile her sister, Jenny Kenyon, paid tribute to her 'beautiful big sister' and said she would love her forever. Police announced on Saturday that they found a body in the Forest of Bowland on Friday night, April 27, which they believed to be Ms Kenyon's.  Now Lancashire Police has confirmed it is her and a post-mortem has determined she died from 'head injuries'. 'We can now sadly confirm that the body found in the Forest of Bowland is that of Katie Kenyon,' it said.  'Police found Katie on Friday following extensive searches and she has now been formally identified as the missing Padiham mum, 33. 'Our thoughts remain with Katie's family and loved ones at this difficult time. The family continues to be supported by specially trained officers. 'A Home Office post-mortem examination was conducted yesterday and the cause of death was given as head injuries. 'We would like to thank, once again, all those who helped during the search for Katie. 'Andrew Burfield, 50, of Todmorden Road in Burnley has appeared in court charged with Katie's murder and will be face trial in November.'  Burfield appeared in court on Friday charged with her murder. The 50-year-old appeared at Preston Crown Court by videolink from HMP Preston, speaking only to confirm his identity. He was remanded into custody ahead of a crown court trial in November. Judge Medland QC set a date for Burfield to return to court on August 22 for a plea and trial preparation hearing, Lancashire Live reports. Police spent a week desperately searching for the mother-of-one, with officers focusing their efforts on the Forest of Bowland and Gisburn Forest. Police set up forensic tents in multiple areas in an effort to trace her after she disappeared last week. Typically the structures can be used to protect forensic evidence, but may also be staked out to provide cover for equipment.   More than 60 specialist search officers from four police forces have been scouring land looking for her. The hunt involved police and fire service officers, dog teams, mounted police, mountain rescue volunteers and drones. Scores of officers have been seen scouring the 3,000-acre Gisburn Forest, some 23 miles from Todmorden Road in Ms Kenyon's hometown. Ms Kenyon was seen getting into a silver Ford Transit van which left Burnley towards the Bolton-by-Bowland area at around 9.30am.    ",
  "354110f11a5351b3ce0f71cc26f2c6145c3b18fb261067863ba1c4a8": "Senior Conservative MP Crispin Blunt has announced he will stand down at the next general election - just weeks after he was forced to apologise for defending a fellow Tory convicted of sexual assault. In a statement on his website, Mr Blunt, 61, revealed he will end his time in the House of Commons after 'seven increasingly tumultuous parliaments'. The Reigate MP was first elected in 1997 and went on to serve in David Cameron's Coalition government as a justice minister, before later becoming the chair of the Commons' Foreign Affairs Committee. In recent weeks, Mr Blunt caused an outrage after he claimed Wakefield MP Imran Ahmad Khan's conviction of sexual assault on a 15-year-old boy was a 'dreadful miscarriage of justice'. He said he was 'utterly appalled and distraught' at the verdict in the trial of his 'friend' and claimed it was 'nothing short of an international scandal'. Mr Blunt subsequently deleted his statement and offered an apology for his defence of Khan being 'a cause of significant upset and concern not least to victims of sexual offences'. He also resigned as the chair of a parliamentary group for international LGBT+ rights and was suspended by the official Conservative Party LGBT+ group, pending an investigation. Mr Blunt was criticised by both fellow Tories and Labour over his 'appalling' defence of Khan, who was found guilty by a jury of sexually assaulting a teenage boy, who is now 29, in 2008. A court heard how Khan forced the then-teenager to drink gin and tonic, dragged him upstairs, pushed him on to a bed and asked him to watch pornography before the attack at a house in Staffordshire. His conviction saw him expelled from the Conservative Party and Khan has since said he will quit as an MP as he attempts to appeal the verdict. Mr Blunt revealed his own planned departure from the Commons on the 25th anniversary of him first being elected to Parliament.  In his statement today, the former army officer said he wanted to 'use this 25th anniversary to make public, what those closest to me have known privately for some time, that after seven increasingly tumultuous parliaments, this will be my last'. He added: 'In looking forward to the next two years or so of this Parliament, whilst securing my re-election is no longer an interest, there will be continued joy in representing the citizens I've had the honour to serve for 25 years. 'I still enjoy the personal motivation to do this to the best of my ability, using my experience in their interests, individual and collective; to help secure the future of the Party that has given me this opportunity; and to also continue to call out long established populist views on policy shibboleths that continue to cause damage to our society and beyond.' Mr Blunt said he had given notice to his constituency association chairman that they should commence the process of selecting a candidate for the next general election. He holds a majority of more than 18,000 votes in his Reigate constituency, which is a long-time safe Tory seat. ",
  "b53b4a034130b25227449e8a2a88c9b2327c4e62c756dcd7e88b4118": "Britons are not booking holidays till the last minute before they go, aiming to avoid Covid disruption and extra, unexpected costs.  Bookings for the May half-term school holidays are down by five per cent compared to 2019, though the number is expected to pass pre-pandemic levels by mid-May according to the Times.  Members of Advantage Travel Partnership, the UK's biggest group of travel agents, said that 40 per cent of all holiday bookings were now for travel within the next 12 weeks. Holidaymakers are also choosing to take one long break instead of multiple short trips, in an effort to avoid extra Covid disruption. Many travel companies are doing all they can to offer more flexible booking policies, such as giving customers the option to postpone or amend their holiday and making it easier to claim a refund.  However, the International Air Transport Association predicts that airline passenger numbers will still not return to pre-pandemic levels until 2024.     Pre-pandemic, most Brits booked summer holidays during the January 'peaks' window at the start of the year.  But the Omicron variant closed borders that month, causing no post-Christmas surge in holiday bookings.   Kelly Cookes, Advantage's leisure director, said the trend for last-minute bookings is expected to continue into the summer due to growing travel uncertainty. 'It's completely different from the pattern that we would have seen pre-pandemic,' she told The Times.

ONS data showed that Britons made 6.1 million visits abroad by air in the summer of 2021, which was a decrease of 76% compared with the summer of 2019. UK residents spent PS4.9 billion on visits abroad in July to September of 2021, this was a decrease of 78% compared with July to September 2019. Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of Airlines UK, said airlines are being forced to 'plan summer blind' due to ever-changing border restrictions. Speaking in Madeira, he said: 'We are incredibly relieved where we are now.' 'We all want to put Covid behind us now although there are still a number of challenges, not least sustainability but also getting through the summer with labour shortages,' after mass lay-offs.  John Holland-Kaye, the chief executive of Heathrow airport, has suggested the surge in bookings was a 'bubble' that would burst and that Americans think 'London is under attack' because of the war in Europe. Critics say the airport is tactically making an effort to boost its chances as the Civil Aviation Authority is allowing it to increase passengers fees. An announcement on the five-year deal is expected this summer. 'It's all just so cynical,' an anonymous aviation industry source said.  'A man stranded on the moon could see what they're trying to do. Nobody else in UK aviation is talking down their own sector like this -- literally nobody. It's hugely disappointing when we've spent two years in the trenches together battling Covid and now they do this.'",

Managers at Stephenson Harwood are giving lawyers and other employees the option to stay at home permanently in return for the financial sacrifice. Junior lawyers at the company have starting salaries of PS90,000, meaning anyone taking up the officer would lose around PS18,000. A spokesman told the Times the offer would be available to all staff in London and most of its international offices, but partners would not be eligible. The firm, which dates back to London, employs more than 1100 staff in the UK with eight offices across Asia, Europe and the Middle East. It is among the 50 highest-earning legal firms in the UK Specialisms include maritime law, intellectual property and real estate, and full equity partners receive an average of PS685,000. Stephenson Harwood said it expected only a few staff to choose WFH full time, because, 'For the vast majority of our people, our hybrid working policy works well'. Currently staff on a hybrid working arrangement can WFH two days a week. The firm's pay reduction policy for full time WFH comes after the firm recruited lawyers during the pandemic who were not based in London, where living costs tend to be higher. The spokesman said that in theory a senior associate solicitor could choose to WFH full time even if they lived in London, but it is likely they would be ruled out for promotion to become a partner.   Many companies are facing a battle to tempt staff back into the office, with some offering inducements such as free lunches and cinema evenings. Meanwhile, Jacob Rees-Mogg is leading the government's efforts to persuade civil servants back to the office. Yesterday, the minister hinted staff could see their London weighting scrapped if they do not come back in for most of the week. According to calculations by the TaxPayers' Alliance pressure group, removing the subsidy - which is awarded to offset the higher cost of living in the capital - from those who work from home three days a week or more would save up to PS250 million. If such a move was imposed, it would affect many working at the Home Office, the Ministry of Justice, the Cabinet Office and the Department for Work and Pensions, who are currently being asked to go into the office for just two days a week. The Cabinet Office last night insisted that the estimate was too high because more London-based civil servants are going into work for the majority or all of the time. But Tory MPs welcomed the idea. Sir Iain Duncan Smith, MP for Chingford and Woodford Green, said: 'If they simply refuse to come back to work for the majority of the week surely London weighting should be removed. They are paid to come into work, and if they are not, they should not get that money.' Danielle Boxall, media manager at the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Taxpayers facing a cost of living crisis want to know they are getting value for money from the Civil Service. If mandarins insist on going remote long-term, officials must make savings.'",
  "731318f19b78b41e88b6e0f96aeca1052a9d281e0200c1fcc7f3528d": "Outraged locals have voiced their disgust over a 'puke green' new paint job for a historic harbour footpath in a popular seaside town.  The new footway is part of a seven-month project to resurface and improve the street scene on Custom House Quay in Weymouth, Dorset. However, the bright green hue has left residents unimpressed after it was likened to 'vomit' - whilst another said the path was 'vile' and 'incredibly uninviting' to walk on. Councillor Louie O'Leary branded the path 'disgusting' and compared the colour to the character Shrek from the 2001 eponymous animated comedy. Cllr O'Leary said: 'I've raised the Shrek coloured Quay with the cabinet member for highways. It's disgusting. 'I was the only member of the south and west area planning committee to vote against the current harbour scheme last year and feel very vindicated in doing so. However if we're going to have it, let's make the most of it.' Locals flocked to social media to complain that the green colour ruined the council's ongoing improvement works and likened the harbour to a children's playground. Writing on Facebook, Aaron Grant Jones, said: 'You can't modernise your windows along there, but you can paint the pavement puke green? Solid logic.' Local resident, Jane Long, added: 'Our lovely working harbour looks like a playground.' Earl Godwin replied: 'When they said they wanted everyone and everything to go green, someone at the council took the idea quite literally.' William Evans said: 'Walked along it yesterday. It was vile, incredibly uninviting.' Stuart Law added: 'In no way is this in keeping with an historic harbour. The council have broken their own Conservation Area rules, by not replacing like for like.' Other residents said the path would 'enhance' the area and claimed the paint had already faded. Christopher James Toms wrote: 'I like it, I think it will greatly enhance the area, I've seen it in a few countries and like it myself.' It is not the first time the council faced criticism for 'ghastly' changes to the harbour. Officials came under fire in April last year after installing new safety railings to stop people falling into the water that locals said looked like cheap scaffolding poles. Many claimed the railings would put an end to the age-old tradition of people sitting on the harbour wall to eat fish and chips and restrict crabbers from dangling their lines in the water. Weymouth Harbour was formed in the 12th century in what is now the old town of the seaside resort. During the Second World War 'little ships' set off from the quayside to help with the Dunkirk evacuation and thousands of troops embarked on landing craft for D-Day there. The route for the new footways was closed for months and the area turned into a building site as the work was carried out. The programme of works started last October and has included footway widened and resurfaced, kerbs realigned, roads resurfaced and new drainage channels installed. But the project is behind schedule and expected to finish on May 27. Dorset Council said it will be installing benches along the harbourside footway, erecting signs, reinstating bollards and finishing lining work over the next month",
  "eb1ed24c29dc243970121e6998ab6495c3e5e9c97ff7a557500a8647": "An EastEnders actor has described being abused hundreds of times at the hands of a showbiz paedophile who sang with Dame Shirley Bassey. Stuart Antony, 34, of Gravesend, Kent, who played a friend of Shane Richie's Alfie Moon in the BBC soap, is speaking out after being abused in a five-year ordeal. His attacker Billy Nutt, who was once a backing singer for Dame Shirley, was jailed for 18 years - and Mr Antony has told how he 'suffered in silence' during the abuse. Nutt, a singer and former landlord of pubs in Kent, worked as a musician around the world on cruise ships and theatres, and released five solo albums after beginning his career in 1997. He also once supported Dame Shirley while she was on tour. But he committed a string of offences on three victims between 1998 and 2007 in various towns around Kent, including Maidstone, Dartford and Broadstairs.  Nutt began abusing Mr Antony when he was just ten years old. The 62-year-old named his boat One Moment - after one of his songs - but then used it to carry out some of the attacks on the boys. The abuse was reported to Kent Police between 2014 and 2016 and Nutt, of Maidstone, was arrested and later charged with 21 sexual crimes involving three children. At Southwark Crown Court he was jailed for 18 years for the abuse of the three victims. Nutt denied the charges but was convicted by a jury after a 12-day trial at Maidstone Crown Court last August. Mr Antony, who also appeared in police drama The Bill, has now waived his right to anonymity to speak about his fight for justice and his experiences. He said the abuse first started when he was aged ten when Nutt was a family friend who sang in the pub where his mother worked. He said: 'We just saw him like an uncle but looking back it was all part of that grooming process.' Nutt was previously jailed for four years in 2015 for abusing a four-year-old boy and again for nine months in 2019 for grooming another child. Mr Antony first went to the police about the abuse he suffered in 2016 after finding out Nutt's abuse of another youngster. He added: 'What triggered it for me was knowing he had just been jailed for abusing another child. I thought if I come forward and report it, I might prevent him from attacking other victims. 'I picked up the phone. I felt guilty and nervous but I knew this had to be done. I had had years of counselling and thought I could deal with the issues that way but deep inside I knew I need to report him to police and I am so glad that I did.' Officers arrived at his home within an hour to take his statement. Mr Antony added: 'At first I was reluctant to tell them everything because of embarrassment and guilt. But these were specially trained officers who immediately put me at ease. 'I was just so pleased somebody believed me because I had bottled this up for years, which affected all my personal life leaving me angry and drinking too much.' The dossier was sent to the Crown Prosecution Service and by the time they authorised a charge, two other victims had come forward. The case then took nearly five years before it got to court - because it was a painstaking investigation. Mr Antony added: 'Many times I was tempted to say I don't want it to continue but then I reminded myself there were others who had come forward. 'And I have to say I received the best support from my family and friends. I can't thank them enough for their love, especially when I was at my lowest.' Mr Antony has used his experiences to pen a new TV drama, called Iris, and has been researching the life of barristers to help with the project. The actor is also appearing in the show, Cockney and Scouse, due to be broadcast in the US. He decided to attend the sentencing hearing at Southwark Crown Court to see the outcome of the case. He said: 'As I sat in the public gallery, I could hear my heart beating. Even though Nutt had been found guilty I still felt nervous and I was genuinely shocked when I heard the judge say 18 years - but it is a just sentence. 'I suffered in silence, no one should have to do that. William Nutt sexually abused me on hundreds of occasions over a long period of time which has mentally scarred me. I cannot and will not let this haunt me for the rest of my life. 'My anger, sadness and guilt towards this situation has controlled me for over two decades and it will not from this moment on. 'The fact that I've had to stand up in a court full of people and tell them exactly what happened to me is the most embarrassing and shameful moment of my life. 'Having to tell my mother, partner and loved ones intimate details about this abuse is something that I wouldn't wish on anybody. 'Thank you to my family and friends for being there every step of the way, Kent Police, the Crown Prosecution Service and prosecution barrister Madeline Wolfe.' Detective Sergeant Nicky Spicer, of the North Kent Vulnerability Investigation Team, praised the brave victims for coming forward to help get Nutt jailed. She said after the sentencing: 'Nutt has subjected three vulnerable young victims to appalling crimes for his own gratification. 'This was compounded when he pleaded not guilty at the trial and forced the victims to revisit their ordeals whilst giving evidence. 'I would like to commend the three victims for the courage they have shown in ensuring their abuser has now been convicted. 'This sentence illustrates once again our determination to investigate all reports of non-recent sex offences and I hope it will encourage other victims of this type of abuse to come forward. 'We have a team of specialist officers who work relentlessly to ensure that offenders like Nutt do not evade justice, just because a crime may have happened a long time ago. 'I would also like to assure anyone who may have been a victim of abuse that they will be treated with the utmost care and understanding.'",
  "644e5acc21c87bffa09bc84e8e475c309e2d5bc29448ade3e0e6a6b6": "A choirmaster vicar has been defrocked for sharing a bed with an adult male lodger after telling him he needed comforting for 'night terrors'. Rev Simon Lumby, 52, who has already resigned from his parish and the priesthood, was found to have crossed the professional boundaries twice with members of his congregation, according to a judgment just published. Both complaints arose out of his behaviour at St Aidan's Church, New Parks, Leicester, a misconduct panel was told. The most recent accusation was made in April 2020, by the vicar's former lodger, referred to only as Person 1, who has since married another person. It was claimed Mr Lumby fondled his guest in the vicarage and allowed him to repeatedly enter his room at night and stay there. The panel was told that at the time Mr Lumby, referred to as SL, was not only the landlord but mentor of the lodger, who was exploring Christianity with a view to joining the priesthood himself. The church said: 'Person 1 started worshipping at St Aidan's in December 2012. Person 1 quickly became a regular attender (four times a week) and decided to get confirmed. 'Individual instruction was provided for him by SL and Person 1 was confirmed. 'Shortly afterwards, Person 1 began exploring whether he had a vocation for ordination, and discussed this with SL 4 who suggested that he should act as Person 1's Spiritual Director and Confessor. 'Person 1 spent Holy Week living with SL at the vicarage, and moved into the vicarage as SL's lodger. 'When he gave evidence, Person 1 was asked why he chose to move into the vicarage, and he stated that it was more convenient, it was quieter than his former accommodation, he was thinking about ordination, and that - at least initially - he and SL had a very positive relationship.' The vicar was said to be 'undergoing a period of stress and anxiety resulting in 'night terrors' as a result of other matters relating to his accommodation and challenges in his ministry'. The judgment continued: 'Person 1 gave evidence that when SL had a night terror, he would get up from his own bed, go to SL's room, and wake him up. 'On occasions he would have to do this several times a night. Person 1 said that SL wanted to be comforted, and that he would sit on his bed and hug him.' Physical contact progressed to sitting in his bed with him, and from there to sleeping in his bed with him, to touching, the panel found. After a few months, the lodger had formed a relationship with the other member of the congregation he was to marry and the two men argued about it until the lodger left the vicarage never to return. In 2019, he was involved in a confrontation with another student. He later told the collage principal he had been 'sexually abused' by a priest and the church was informed. The panel agreed the lodger had consented to what happened 'which in all probability took place in the context of an intimate friendship between the two of them, and when both were under the influence of alcohol'. However, the Bishop's Disciplinary Tribunal for the Diocese of Leicester said the harm caused to the victim was 'significant' in terms of his 'mental health, his sense of shame, his distrust for authority, and the effects upon both his training and ministry.' Members also noted that the Vicar has a number of previous findings of misconduct, in particular the first dated 25 July 2013, in which he sent inappropriate text messages to a 17-year-old boy. The judgment continued: 'We requested, and were provided with details of the circumstances of this misconduct which had clear sexual undertones. 'We were deeply concerned by what they revealed about the Respondent's conduct towards a vulnerable child who was a member of his congregation. 'In both that previous case and the present case, there was a wholesale failure to observe proper boundaries.' The vicar, who denied all the allegations, did not turn up to the hearing in January, but sent a letter saying: 'I am writing to inform you of my decision to resign both as Vicar of Saint Aidan's New Parks and to resign my Orders as an Anglican Priest. 'For convenience, it would make sense that, and as far as I am concerned, my resignation will take effect from the end of this month. 'I am fully aware that the process I currently find myself in will continue... I have come to the decision that my submitted answer will be my last word on this subject and that the process will therefore have to continue without me. I will no longer engage with it.' Mr Lumby is a conductor, tenor, pianist, and organist of note, who has since returned to his role as a freelance musician and choir leader, According to his website, he now directs 'Viva la Musica' - an exciting young Chamber Choir in Loughborough and is also the Musical Director of the Ryton Chorale, a large choral society based in Worksop. Contacted about the allegations, he said: 'I have absolutely nothing to say.. Please don't ring.'",
  "1f5384e6d28d8bc5f90f99d5064575bc213b5642d1d26828e89b221a": "An NHS medic has been struck off for giving herself laughing gas during operations after claiming to colleagues she was just testing the equipment.  Surgical worker Ruramayi Runzirwayi used anaesthetic equipment to self-administer nitrous oxide and oxygen on multiple occasions. When colleagues caught the operating department practitioner (ODP) inhaling the pain killing gas - also known as 'hippy crack' - she claimed she was making sure the equipment worked, a disciplinary hearing was told. The allegations related to three separate incidents. The first, while working for the Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust in August 2018, Miss Runzirwayi was seen holding the breathing circuit near her face and then later seen with the patient end of the breathing circuit in her mouth. Then on February 12 and February 13, 2019, while working for Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, she was seen with the breathing circuit near her face and neck with the oxygen and nitrous oxide flowmeters turned on.  Miss Runzirwayi has now been thrown out of the profession after a committee of the Health and Care Professions Tribunal Service found her actions amounted to misconduct, having put patients at risk. The committee heard she qualified as an ODP in September 2017, less than a year before the first incident. The role involves preparing instruments and equipment for doctors ahead of people undergoing surgery. In August 2018 Miss Runzirwayi was working through an agency at the Good Hope Hospital in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, having started there in July 2018. She was working as an assistant to a consultant anaesthetist, referred to only as Dr JE. He told the committee that after the second operation of the afternoon session he saw Miss Runzirwayi holding the end of a plastic tube which carries anaesthetic gases to the patient - known as a Bain circuit - close to her face. Later, after the third surgery, he again saw Miss Runzirwayi in the same room, holding the end of the Bain circuit to her face while standing in front of the anaesthetic machine. On this occasion Dr JE said he saw the nitrous oxide flow was turned up to near the top of its range, while the amount of oxygen was turned down. When the consultant asked her what she was doing, Miss Runzirwayi claimed there was a fault with the machine. Dr JE said he expressed his concerns to a senior nurse at the hospital, before returning to the anaesthetic room. He again saw Miss Runzirwayi standing in front of anaesthetic machine, this time with the tube inside her mouth. He ran to tell the senior sister and they were both able to see what happened by looking through windows in the door to the room, the hearing was told. When she was confronted about this incident, Miss Runzirwayi accepted she had inhaled nitrous oxide and that she had lied about the machine not working. Her agency was informed and she did not return to the hospital. The committee then heard about a similar incident on February 12, 2019, while Miss Runzirwayi was working through a different agency at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, at the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre in Oxford, Oxfordshire. Dr AM, a consultant anaesthetist, saw her in an anaesthetic room sitting on a chair, holding the anaesthetic circuit to her mouth and nose. He said the nitrous oxide and oxygen flows were turned on and when he confronted Miss Runzirwayi she told him she had hurt her leg. The next day - February 13, 2019 - at the same hospital, a deputy theatre manager found Miss Runzirwayi sitting next to an anaesthetic machine with her elbows on her knees. The committee heard the machine was on with nitrous oxide and oxygen flowing. The circuit from the anaesthetic machine was in her hands going up between her breasts and her head was slumped down, the hearing was told. The committee heard this incident happened while there was a patient in the operating theatre and the anaesthetic room Miss Runzirwayi was in was set up for the next patient. The committee ruled Miss Runzirwayi 'put patients at unwarranted risk of harm' by 'inhaling nitrous oxide during her shift'. It concluded: 'The nature of the serious breaches of (our) standards of conduct, performance and ethics mean that [Miss Runzirwayi] both breached fundamental tenets of her profession and brought it into disrepute. 'The misconduct found included a breach of trust and abuse of [her] professional position.' The hearing was told the Miss Runzirwayi submitted a letter to the panel in November 2021 and referred to 'personal difficulties' she was experiencing at the time, what she had done since the time of the incidents and her wishes for future work as an ODP.  The committee said it had no other option but to strike her off as there was 'insufficient evidence' her actions would not be repeated, which put patients at risk of harm. ",
  "96f0f0e7cc8dd373e5ae735be88443394c751da79887aaa88858afaf": "Eton schoolboys have launched a protest over fears that the PS42,000-a-year public school's woke leadership wants to scrap its 160-year-old hunting society.  The prestigious institution, attended by the likes of David Cameron and PM Boris Johnson, failed to recruit a new Kennel Huntsman for the Eton College Hunt (ECH) to replace the previous incumbent who recently left for another role. Trustees of the ECH, made up of former Etonians and the Hunting Office, claimed there is a national shortage of Kennel Huntsmen and seven other hunts have also been unable to fill the position.  The hounds have subsequently been relocated as a 'temporary measure' despite many parents offering to keep the pack together at their own estates, reports The Telegraph.  In response to news, hundreds of pupils dressed in white tie and black tailcoats gathered outside Eton's main building for a 'Leggit'- a rare and powerful gesture which is supposed to give the boys a voice - on Friday morning to protest to masters about the future of the hunting society. Beagling is the hunting of hares and rabbits by beagles - who track them by scent.  A beagle pack (10 or more hounds) is usually followed on foot, but in a few cases mounted. The beagling club at Eton dates back to 1858. It is only one of three public schools which still have a beagling pack - the others being Radley and Stowe. The school classes beagling as one of a host of 'minor sports' offered to pupils alongside other activities such as clay-pigeon shooting, the Wall Game, mountaineering, archery, aikido and fencing. In a video, posted to TikTok over the weekend, pupils could be heard chanting 'what do we think of Gregg? S*** What do we think of s***? Gregg,' at the Leggit, thought to be the 'largest in a decade', referencing Eton's deputy head for pastoral matters, David Gregg. The beagling club at Eton dates back to 1858.

The school classes beagling as one of a host of 'minor sports' offered to pupils alongside other activities such as clay-pigeon shooting, the Wall Game, mountaineering, archery, aikido and fencing. Despite ongoing fears that the college will axe the long-running tradition, the college has stated that the current arrangements are 'solely because we have not yet managed to replace the Kennel Huntsman'.  An Eton spokesperson told MailOnline: 'Eton's beagle pack is currently being looked after by other hunts as a temporary measure while the College continues its search for a new Kennel Huntsman, at which point the hounds will return to Eton.'  Students and parents are worried the college is quietly terminating the society as displeasure continues to grow over its woke headmaster Simon Henderson, nicknamed 'Trendy Hendy', who is said to have lost the confidence of some staff with his ideas for cultural changes at Eton. Simon Henderson took over his role as Eton College headmaster five years ago and was nicknamed 'Trendy Hendy' by pupils. He is said to have a habit of wearing chino trousers and open-necked shirts, overseeing what has been viewed as a cultural change at the famous school. Mr Henderson once suggested he might get rid of Eton's traditional tailcoats and is known to be interested by modern management techniques. In 2016, he announced plans to split Eton's deputy head-master role into two, creating one deputy head for 'academic' affairs and another for 'pastoral' matters. He has also created a new role of 'director of inclusion education' to oversee diversity at Eton, and made a woman the Lower Master, or deputy head, for the first time. A source has told the Daily Telegraph that Mr Henderson 'feels strongly' about changing perceptions of Eton as an 'old fashioned pillar of social and male elitism'. It comes after Eton College sacked  English teacher, Will Knowland, following a dispute over a controversial lecture on 'gender roles'. Mr Knowland was removed from his role and referred to the Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) after refusing to take down a lecture challenging the theory of 'toxic masculinity' from his own personal YouTube.  Mr Henderson, who is said to wear chino trousers and open-necked shirts, has previously suggested getting rid of Eton's traditional tailcoats and is said to want to change perceptions of it as an 'old fashioned pillar of social and male elitism'. An unnamed former Etonian previously said he feared that Mr Henderson was 'capitulating to the plagues of liberal society in 2020 where intolerance is dressed up as tolerance, bullying is cloaked by moral self-righteousness and there's a less-than-critical acceptance of the doctrines of radical political movements.'  It comes after the school sacked English teacher, Will Knowland, last year following a dispute over a controversial lecture on 'gender roles'. Mr Knowland was removed from his role and referred to the Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) after refusing to take down a lecture challenging the theory of 'toxic masculinity' from his own personal YouTube. More than 1,000 pupils signed a petition calling for his reinstatement and more have donated to his legal fees amid claims he was subject to the ultimate censorship over the planned lecture in which he was due to question 'current radical feminist orthodoxy'. The school, whose old boys include princes William and Harry, and author George Orwell, was accused of being 'heartless and merciless' in its treatment of Mr Knowland and of 'prioritising emotional safety over intellectual challenge'.  Sarah-Jane Bentley, who is a colleague of Mr Knowland, slammed the school over his removal and previously criticised Mr Henderson for 'damaging the school'.  She wrote: 'Eton has been brought into disrepute for a matter that could have been resolved amicably ... The lack of management of this matter has damaged the school.' Bentley also added that the sacking had created 'deep divisions and a climate of fear' in the teachers' common room, as well as a 'bad feeling in the wider Eton community'. In 2016, the college was forced to 'urgently' investigate claims its beagling club took part in an illegal hare hunt that was captured on video. Undercover investigators say they took footage of a hare being pursued by dogs at a hunt in October last year. The footage includes a huntsman shouting 'Tally Ho!' and a pack of beagles pursing a hare across fields at Aldby Park in Buttercrambe, North Yorkshire. The League Against Cruel Sports alleged that the hunt involved the Eton College Beagles and said it has passed the footage to police. The group said that they acted on a tip-off and that the huntmasters are identifiable by their distinctive brown velvet jackets. ",
  "794682b870008f0a1ffc6ab59f4325fb9d5d9ae76f6e3ee0e0fc1ff3": "Senior Conservatives are at odds over whether the party should choose from an all-female shortlist when selecting a by-election candidate to replace porn-watching MP Neil Parish. A by-election contest is due to be held in Mr Parish's Tiverton and Honiton constituency after he announced he would quit Parliament. It followed his admission he twice watched pornography in the House of Commons in a 'moment of madness' - although Mr Parish said the first occasion occurred as he attempted to look at tractors online. Mr Parish's resignation has come amid a blitz of sexism, misogny and harassment allegations at Westminster. This has led to calls for the Conservatives to display 'real evidence of change' by ensuring their by-election candidate is a woman.  But government minister Michelle Donelan today rejected demands for the Tories to use 'demeaning' all-female shortlists or quotas in deciding on election candidates. She told Sky News: 'I've never been in favour of shortlists and quotas. 'We get more women into parliament by encouraging them, by breaking down barriers, by initiatives like Women2Win. 'We don't do it by putting in quotas which I find quite demeaning to women. 'Women can get there on merit.' Ms Donelan, the universities minister, drew a comparison between Britain's first two female prime ministers being Tories, while Labour have never had a permanent female party leader.  She added: 'We have got the Home Secretary (Priti Patel) who is a female, we have got the Foreign Secretary (Liz Truss) who is a female: those individuals got there on merit.'  Ms Donelan also said he had not personally experience any harassment in Parliament, but that it was 'horrific and alarming' to see so may reports of such conduct. 'This is not the majority of MPs, this is a minority,' she said. 'These are misogynistic dinosaurs. They do not represent the majority of MPs.' Senior Conservative MP Caroline Nokes, the chair of the Commons' Women and Equalities Committee, has led calls for the Tories to ensure their candidate to succeed Mr Parish is female. She told The Times: 'It would be real evidence of change if the Conservatives made sure they selected a local woman as the candidate for the by-election.' Ms Nokes called on her party to 'seize the moment' and highlighted how two recent by-elections had been won for the Tories by women. 'Conservative women like Trudy Harrison (the Copeland MP elected in 2017) and Jill Mortimer (the Hartlepool MP chosen last year) are proof that they can win by-elections and then be great parliamentarians.' Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon today said she believes the problems of sexism and misogyny in politics are getting worse - in part due to the impact of social media. The SNP leader told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'I don't thinks there is a woman alive, not just in politics but in any walk of life, who will not have experienced somewhere on the spectrum of misogyny and sexism behaviour which is unacceptable. 'In some ways I think it is worse today than it was when I was a woman starting out in politics. 'You become a bit inured to it and get used to it whereas I see it much more starkly through the eyes younger women.' Friends of Mr Parish have claimed the MP was in fact searching for 'Dominator' combine harvesters when he opened a link to an adult website in the Commons. Devon county councillor Colin Slade said he 'could see' how the search might have led to inappropriate content. Mr Parish has described how he had initially been looking for tractors before viewing the adult content. 'I did get into another website that had a very similar name and I watched it for a bit, which I shouldn't have done,' he told the BBC. 'But my crime - biggest crime - is that on another occasion I went in a second time.'",
  "dd8a78d0ab1c8202d390086399ebd4664a34f63ecd94d5fca0e969a6": "Millions of people have been left without access to dental care after 2,000 dentists quit the NHS in England last year, a report has warned.  The number of NHS dentists fell from 23,733 at the end of 2020 to 21,544 at the end of January this year, according to the Association of Dental Groups (ADG). It means around 4million people could struggle to get treatment on the NHS, given each dentist has a caseload of about 2,000 patients. The NHS now has the smallest dentist workforce in a decade, according to the ADG, which obtained the figures through Freedom of Information (FOI) requests. In the report, seen by The Guardian, the trade association warns: 'We are now seeing 'dental deserts' emerge across the country where there is almost no chance of ever seeing an NHS dentist for routine care.  'Dental deserts present a serious risk to the dental health of millions of NHS patients in England.' The ADG also warned it could spell a silent rise in mouth cancers and diabetes, which are often spotted at check-ups. North Lincolnshire is identified as the part of England with the smallest number of NHS dentists per 100,000 people, at just 32, according to the report. A record-breaking three million patients were referred for cancer checks over the past year amid a post-pandemic surge. The number has risen from 2.4million, according to NHS data. Figures also reveal that around 315,000 patients started treatment for the disease in the last year, 2,000 up on pre-Covid numbers. Dame Cally Palmer, national cancer director for NHS England, said there were still 30,000 people who have not yet begun treatment due to the pandemic. But she added that the latest figures suggest progress is being made to diagnose patients earlier. To meet the higher demand for cancer checks, NHS services are being expanded including one-stop shops for tests, mobile clinics and symptom hotlines. Charities welcomed the rise in referrals but warned of the 'devastating impact' of the pandemic on cancer care and urged ministers to tackle the long-term problem of NHS understaffing. Dame Cally said: 'We are going further and faster than ever before in our ambitions to diagnose more cancers at an earlier stage so that we can save more lives. 'We have seen record numbers of people coming forward for checks in the last year, but we know there are still at least 30,000 who haven't started treatment due to the pandemic, so it's vital that we keep these referral rates high.' Professor Peter Johnson, NHS England national clinical director for cancer, said: 'We know the pandemic meant that at first we saw fewer patients, but in the last year GPs have been referring people for investigation in record numbers and have been working hard to make sure people with worrying symptoms can be seen.' The NHS clinical commissioning groups (CCG) in North East Lincolnshire and the East Riding of Yorkshire both have just 37 NHS dentists for every 100,000 people. Access to NHS dental care is so limited in the worst affected areas that people in are forced to wait for up three years for an appointment, the report claims. The ADG blames Covid, Brexit and Government underfunding of NHS dental services for the 'critical' situation. Dentists say their current NHS contract is fuelling the exodus, along with a growing gap between the number retiring and those being recruited.  The ADG fears the situation will worsen when new rules, which come into force at the end of the year, mean healthcare qualifications obtained by workers from the European Economic Area will no longer be recognised. Dentists from the EEA, which includes the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, have historically made up about a fifth of new recruits. Louise Ansari, national director of NHS watchdog Healthwatch England, told The Guardian: 'People are struggling to get the dental treatment they need when they need it. This is a hugely worrying issue.  'Children, disabled people and people living in care homes are the worst affected  'Some dental practices have either shut down or have gone fully private, with some dentists having used up their total NHS capacity and are asking people for private fees instead.' The ADG report also reveals that just a quarter (26.1 per cent) of adults in Thurrock in Essex have seen an NHS dentist in the previous two years, the lowest anywhere.  It was followed by West Essex (27.3 per cent) and Kent and Medway (29.3 per cent). Thurrock was also home to the lowest proportion of children who saw a dentist in the last year (30.7 per cent). North-east London is next (32.2 per cent) followed by North Lincolnshire (35.3 per cent).  A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: 'We've given the NHS PS50 million to fund up to 350,000 extra dental appointments and we are growing the workforce so people can get the oral care they need - in December 2021, there were 264 more dentists registered than the previous year.' 'We are committed to levelling up health outcomes across the country - we have set up the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities to address the long-standing health disparities and will publish a white paper this year to ensure everyone has the chance to live longer and healthier lives, regardless of background,' the spokesperson added. NHS figures last month showed some 40million dental appointments - equivalent to a whole year's worth of care - have been lost since March 2020. ",
  "59f9931ff6186e04eea28e39daa143fb66bc29f1d7a1cffb86166de0": "Home Office officials have been contacting chief constables to ask them to apply to become the new Met Police commissioner amid fears the botched ousting of Dame Cressida Dick could put people off. Dame Cressida quit in February after losing the support of London mayor Sadiq Khan, who said publicly after a string of scandals that he no longer felt she could restore trust and confidence in the force. Home Secretary Priti Patel has ordered an inquiry into how her departure was handled over concerns that due process was not followed. Now, a string of senior officers have been 'tapped on the shoulder' to apply in order to widen the field of candidates, sources told The Times. As well as being contacted by Home Office officials, chief constables have also been approached by Sophie Linden, Khan's deputy mayor for policing, it is understood. Dame Lynn Owens - Widely admired and was seen as the natural successor to the Yard top job until she retired on health grounds last autumn. Dame Lynne led the National Crime Agency - dubbed 'Britain's FBI' - from 2016 until last October. She has now fully recovered from cancer. Seen as a safe pair of hands, she is known to be a favourite of Home Secretary Priti Patel. Matt Jukes - Matt Jukes joined South Yorkshire police in 1995 three years after graduating with a degree in mathematics from Oxford. He worked as a detective and rose through the ranks to represent UK police forces at G8 meetings and lead on national anti-terror strategy. Mr Jukes is best known for tackling Rotherham grooming gangs while borough commander in the Yorkshire town from 2006 to 2010. He's currently serving as an Assistant Commissioner for Specialist Operations Sir Mark Rowley - A familiar figure after leading the Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism operations for four years. Although he resigned from the police in 2018, Sir Mark is still only 58 and sources believe he could be tempted back by the biggest job in British policing. Served as chief constable of Surrey for three years to 2011, when he joined the Met as an assistant commissioner. Lucy D'Orsi - Previously served as deputy assistant commissioner at the Met before moving to lead the British Transport Police in 2020, where she has impressed colleagues.  Ian Livingstone - The non-nonsense head of Police Scotland for four years who impressed Boris Johnson with his effective policing operation at COP26 in Glasgow.  Shaun Sawyer - The chief constable of Devon and Cornwall Police announced this weekend that he would stand down from his current role. He served in the Met for more than 20 years and is considered highly likely to apply.     One senior officer said: 'It's not surprising they've been trying to get lots of people to apply. They want a decent field as it's the most senior job in policing. 'But the way Cress was treated, and the increasingly political nature of that job -- it's fair to say that's turned a few people off.' A Home Office source said: 'We want to make sure that chief constables know they are welcome to apply, that we want to attract the best from across the country.' Met chief Dame Cressida Dick left the job last week after five years, with her deputy Sir Stephen House temporarily taking the reins until a permanent successor is appointed in the summer. Potential candidates for the post include former director general of the National Crime Agency Dame Lynne Owens and current Met Assistant Commissioner Matt Jukes. Applications close on May 4.   The Met has been mired in a series of incidents that have damaged public confidence, including deeply offensive messages shared by a team based at Charing Cross station and the strip-search of a black schoolgirl. Dame Cressida admitted herself that Sarah Everard's rape and murder by then-serving police officer Wayne Couzens had brought 'shame' on the force and damaged public confidence in police. Britain's most senior officer also failed to get a grip on a culture of racism, sexism and bullying that has haunted Scotland Yard for years. The advert for her replacement states that it has become 'evident that significant and sustained improvements need to be made within the MPS to restore public confidence and legitimacy in the largest police force in the UK.' It continues: 'This will require inspirational leadership to deliver a demonstrably more professional police force, that better reflects the diversity of London itself.' The Met has also been heavily criticised by watchdogs the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) and Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) in recent months. HMICFRS found that the Met's approach to tackling corruption was not fit for purpose, and described storage of evidence by some teams as 'dire' with drugs, jewellery and money going missing and guns not properly secured. While the IOPC took the unusual step of publishing disturbing messages shared by the Charing Cross team - despite the fact that much of the content was too offensive to print in mainstream news coverage - as it detailed the 'disgraceful' behaviour of officers based in a now disbanded Westminster team between 2016 and 2018. IOPC regional director Sal Naseem said that the issues raised were 'not isolated or historic'. Two inquiries, set up in the wake of the murder of Miss Everard, are being held into culture at the Met - an internally-commissioned probe led by Baroness Louise Casey, and a Home Office commissioned inquiry by Dame Elish Angiolini. 'You will lead the service through significant change, role-modelling credible, visible and empowering leadership to address concerns around police conduct and tackling institutional culture. 'The successful candidate will be responsible for re-establishing trust and confidence in policing amongst everyone living in London, particularly women and girls and those from Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities.' The role, considered the most senior police rank in the country, has a salary of PS292,938 - almost twice as much as the Prime Minister.   ",
  "a03fef4bfc981fedf115b3ddead519a0f2a43158524cf23100274254": "Free range eggs will today return to supermarket shelves after hens were finally given the green light to go outside again after a five-month-long bird flu outbreak. In recent weeks, the products have had stickers or labels marking them as 'barn eggs' as birds have had to be housed inside. But from today, shoppers will once again be able to pick up free range eggs - which come from hens with unlimited outdoor access in the daytime - after ministers scrapped the restrictions. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs introduced the measures in late November following an outbreak of avian flu. The Food Standards Agency advises that avian influenza poses a very low food safety risk for consumers, and it has not changed its advice on the consumption of poultry products. The risk of bird flu has been reduced from 'high' to 'medium' for premises with poor biosecurity while further requirements brought in to protect flocks from the outbreak - including cleansing and disinfecting equipment, clothing and vehicles and limiting access to non-essential people on sites - will remain in force for the next few weeks, Defra said. In a joint statement, the four chief veterinary officers said: 'Whilst the lifting of the mandatory housing measures will be welcome news to bird keepers, scrupulous biosecurity remains the most critical form of defence to help keep your birds safe. 'It is thanks to the hard work of all bird keepers and vets, who have played their part in keeping flocks safe this winter, that we are in a position to take this action. 'However, the recent cases of avian influenza show that it's more important than ever for bird keepers to remain vigilant for signs of disease and maintain stringent standards of biosecurity.' The British Free Range Egg Producers Association welcomed the news, but said egg producers were still at breaking point because of soaring costs of production. BFREPA CEO Robert Gooch said: 'It's really good news that shoppers will soon have free range eggs available on the shelves, and British farmers are extremely grateful to consumers for continuing to buy eggs from these flocks even though they have been re-classified as barn eggs. 'But while it's a relief to my members, lifting the housing order does not solve the crisis facing the egg sector. It will not remove the huge hikes in energy, transport, feed and labour costs they are experiencing. 'The picture is bleak - a recent survey of our members suggested 51% of free range and organic egg farmers were considering exiting the industry. Even a small number coming out of egg production would lead to egg shortages which we predict will come later this year.' Poultry farmer Llyr Jones told BBC Radio Four's Today programme this morning he was spending an extra PS400 on feed - a 40% increase on his normal costs - as a result of increasing pressures.",
  "ac0355053e1394c411e26b6c17c36caa3e3e824cee7b6e0770a99a59": "Trans women should call 999 if they feel unsafe after being asked to leave women-only spaces, the UK's largest child transgender charity has said. Mermaids said it was 'not happy' with the Equality and Human Rights Commission's ruling that trans women can be excluded from female-only spaces if there is a legitimate reason, such as protecting privacy. Last month the EHRC published guidance to help venues make lawful decisions on services they offer to women and men separately, such as toilets.  Mermaids said the guidance was 'not the law and cannot be enforced' before listing tips on what to do if 'someone asks you to leave a facility'. It advises those 'at risk of harm' to 'call someone you trust, or... 999'.  Naomi Cunningham, a discrimination law barrister, told the Daily Telegraph: 'The advice to call 999 is grossly irresponsible.' Mermaids was contacted for comment. The EHRC ruled service providers 'wishing to limit services to a single sex are legally able to do so, provided the reasons are justified and proportionate'. These could include 'reasons of privacy, decency, to prevent trauma or to ensure health and safety', it said. Last week, Mermaids criticised the ruling, claiming it was 'not inclusive enough of trans people'. It said: 'You cannot be excluded from a single sex space without a fair reason. Someone being 'scared' of trans people is not a good enough reason'.",

But technology might now have the answer, with a new app that reveals the likelihood of your washing actually drying outside.  Weather forecast firm MetDesk has launched its 'laundry drying index', which has been hailed by users as well as green campaigners for reducing the reliance on tumble-dryers. The app analyses nationwide temperatures, wind speeds, risk of rain, humidity and cloud cover. A map is then compiled using colour-coding to show where the best drying conditions are.  Orange represents 'great' - meaning clothes dry in as little as an hour or two - while blue is 'poor', warning of damp conditions.  The map is also explained in a tongue-in-cheek coloured key made up of clothes on a line.  The daily updates are currently being uploaded on to Twitter by MetDesk, based in Wendover, Bucks, but the firm plans to add it to its Home And Dry weather app for Apple devices this summer and roll out an Android version in the near future.  Experts suggest the map could save users between PS60 and PS100 a year in electricity bills by reducing the amount of wet laundry that ends up in the tumble-dryer.  Tamsin Green, the MetDesk meteorologist who created the laundry index over the past 18 months, said: 'It's been well received and we're planning to put it on the app. It stops your clothes getting wet by combining weather elements, the time of year and complex formulas in a format people can relate to. Energy efficiency was the drive behind it.'  Early users have been impressed. One, Christine Lawrence, tweeted: 'Love it. Saw it and got two loads done and dried in five hours.'  Catherine McGarry wrote: 'Absolute genius', while John Seagrave said the map was 'so useful for saving pounds and our planet'.  Bob Ward, of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, said: 'Tumble-dryers use a lot of electricity, and using radiators to dry clothes makes them less effective. This sees technology turn complicated weather data into a useful resource.'",

Kyiv's men stormed east out of Kharkiv, in north-eastern Ukraine, on Monday and managed to recapture the town of Staryi Saltiv around 30 miles away, according to  a Pentagon intelligence briefing.  The move relieves pressure on Kharkiv, which Putin's men were intending to capture and which has been heavily shelled, while also threatening the main Russian supply route for forces currently fighting in nearby Donbas. Journalists who ventured out of Kharkiv behind the advancing troops described the nearby countryside as an 'open-air graveyard', with the streets and fields littered with bodies lying unclaimed. One of the most-gruesome sights was the discovery of what appeared to be Russian corpses arranged into a 'Z' pattern. The bodies of civilians were also found inside apartments and burned-out vehicles nearby. Both likely constitute war crimes. Meanwhile footage showed Ukrainian artillery destroying a column of Russian armoured vehicles further south, to the west of Izyum, as heavy fighting continues for control over Donbas. The Ukrainian advance came on a day when little else changed along a frontline stretching hundreds of miles from Kharkiv in the north, to Mariupol in the south and further west towards the city of Mykolaiv. American intelligence says Russia launched 30 missiles against targets inside Ukraine yesterday, while artillery continued to pound defensive positions in an attempt to soften them up for troops to attack. Despite the heavy shelling, Russian gains have been 'tepid', the Pentagon said. Moscow's forces made only minor advances around Popansa and further north in the town of Lyman, as they attempt to surround Ukrainian troops defending the cities of Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Slovyansk and Kramatorsk. Both sides are said to be suffering heavy casualties in the region, though Russia's losses are widely expected to be worse than Ukraine's. Russia's slow advances are due to commanders trying to preserve troops after units were mauled in the failed effort to capture Kyiv, the US says.  Meanwhile Ukrainian forces holed up inside the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol continue to hold out against Russian bombardment, which resumed Sunday night after a 48-hour ceasefire allowed 100 civilian to evacuate. Around 12 battalions that had been committed to taking the city have now moved out and been sent to the frontline further north, to aid in the fight for Donbas. Further to the west, fighting continues over territory between Mykolaiv and Kherson - the latter of which is the only major Ukrainian city to have fallen into Russian hands. Kyiv believes that Russia is planning to stage a referendum in Kherson as a pre-text to declaring it independent of Ukraine, perhaps to coincide with a Victory Day parade in Moscow on May 9 marking the surrender of Nazi Germany. American intelligence believes Russia is likely behind schedule in its efforts to seize Donbas, with Ukrainian counter-attacks slowing the advance down. '[The Russians] are clearly in the offensive mode, but they are not being as successful as they wanted to be,' officials briefed journalists yesterday. Russia and Ukraine are now locked into what is likely to be a bloody and prolonged struggle for control of the Donbas region - the outcome of which is likely to prove pivotal to the outcome of the war. Moscow's generals are aiming to capture the region and surround Ukrainian forces entrenched there in the process, in an effort to force their surrender. If that happens, then it will mean a large chunk of the Ukrainian army being killed or captured, increasing the likelihood that Russia will renew attacks further to the west - on Mykolaiv, Odesa, and possibly Kyiv. Ukraine aims to hold its current defensive positions while making limited counter-attacks to weaken or cut Russian supply lines to the front, in an effort to kill or capture as many troops as possible while also destroying equipment. The US and UK estimate that Russia has so-far lost about a quarter of its invasion force. If Ukraine can keep inflicting casualties while preserving its own forces, then it will cause the Russian advance to stall. If Russian losses are particularly severe, then it may make it difficult for Putin's men to hold the territory they have gained and could spark a retreat - as happened in Kyiv. Ultimately, Ukraine aims to push Russia's troops out of the entire country - including parts of Donbas and Crimea it occupied before the February invasion. Liz Truss, the UK foreign secretary, has said that London shares this goal, with the US says its aim is to weaken Russia to the point where it cannot attack again. To that end, President Joe Biden has pledged $33billion in military aid for the country while Britain will today commit to sending an extra PS300million of kit. Supplies include long-range and heavy weapons such as tanks, artillery and helicopters, along with specialist equipment such as night vision goggles and vehicles that can be used to evacuate civilians. Boris Johnson is set to announce the extra package of spending today, echoing his own hero Winston Churchill in an address to Ukraine's parliament by describing the fight to defeat Russia as their 'finest hour'. His appearance comes after his surprise visit to the Ukrainian capital last month. Mr Johnson is expected to say the UK is 'proud to be among Ukraine's friends' after reopening the British embassy in Kyiv last week.  Mr Johnson is expected to say: 'When my country faced the threat of invasion during the Second World War, our Parliament, like yours, continued to meet throughout the conflict, and the British people showed such unity and resolve that we remember our time of greatest peril as our finest hour. 'This is Ukraine's finest hour, an epic chapter in your national story that will be remembered and recounted for generations to come. 'Your children and grandchildren will say that Ukrainians taught the world that the brute force of an aggressor counts for nothing against the moral force of a people determined to be free.'",
  "1ede6f5e8c94b01be240760367a819e1480252013fb1444b53fc3e06": "Commonwealth Bank is the first of Australia's big four banks to raise interest rates for home loans. CBA, which has the biggest share of the home loan market, announced its variable home loan interest rates would increase by 0.25 per cent from May 20, in line with the official cash rate rise. The Reserve Bank of Australia raised interest rates on Tuesday afternoon for the first time in 11 years to curb soaring inflation - surprising financial markets with a bigger than expected increase. By announcing a May 20 start date for the inevitable rise, CBA, which has a quarter of all home loans in Australia, sought to give its customers time to adjust.  Commonwealth Bank: 0.25 per cent increase from May 20, exactly matching the official interest rate rise. Westpac/St George and ANZ: All reviewing their variable interest rates. National Australia Bank: No announcement yet. The rise means CBA customers with a $500,000 home loan will see their monthly repayments go up by $65 from $1,922 to $1,987. On a million dollar home loan, monthly repayments with the bank will jump $130 from $3,843 to $3,973. In many cases it is expected that home loan customers with investment properties will pass the rises directly on to renters.  A Commonwealth spokesperson acknowledged many of its home loan customers would never have experienced a rate rise. 'We are here to help customers who have loans and are considering how repayments might change,' said Angus Sullivan, CBA's group executive, retail banking. 'Some options available to help our customers manage repayments include fixing or splitting loans or setting up an offset account.' The other three big banks - Westpac, ANZ and National Australia Bank - are now expected to follow CBA's lead and announce increases to their home loan rates. The rate rises will mean months of pain for home owners and renters alike with up to seven increases expected to the official RBA rate - each leading to a rate hike by banks. Earlier, RBA Governor Philip Lowe hinted at 'further increases in interest rates' in coming months. This is the first election campaign rate rise since 2007. The cash rate on Tuesday rose by 0.25 percentage points, ending the historic era of a record-low 0.1 per cent cash rate and marking the first increase since November 2010. This was also much bigger than the 0.15 percentage point rise financial markets were expecting, threatening the re-election hopes of Prime Minister Scott Morrison ahead of the May 21 poll. The official rate now stands at 0.35 per cent - the highest since March 2020 at the start of the pandemic - after inflation in the year to March soared by 5.1 per cent - the fastest pace in 21 years. 'We are now in this journey out of the pandemic,' Mr Morrison said on Tuesday after the decision.  'Inflation has picked up significantly and more than expected. 'Of course, a 25 basis point increase in the cash rate, that will be harder and we understand that.'  The central bank move is also the first during an election campaign since November 2007, when former Liberal prime minister John Howard lost power after 11 years and his own seat. But Mr Morrison said many borrowers had fixed their mortgages in preparation for a rate rise and sidestepped a question about whether this had cost him the election. 'Australians have been preparing for this for some time,' Mr Morrison said. Dr Lowe acknowledged the increase on Tuesday was 'earlier than the guidance during the darkest days of the pandemic' two years ago when he promised to keep the cash rate on hold until 2024. 'We expect a further increase in the inflation rate,' he said.  'We expect further increases in interest rates will be necessary in the months ahead.  'If interest rates were to remain unchanged, inflation would be substantially higher.' Three of Australia's Big Four banks - ANZ, Westpac and NAB - are expecting the Reserve Bank to take the cash rate to two per cent by 2023 as rates increase seven more times, with more pain possibly coming in June. Dr Lowe hinted more rate rises were likely in 2022 and 2023 with inflation at the highest level since 2001. 'Given this, and the very low level of interest rates, it is appropriate to start the process of normalising monetary conditions,' he said. Dr Lowe is also expecting the era of low wages growth that began in mid-2013 to be over this year, after last year declaring weak pay increases could help the RBA to keep rates on hold until 2024 'at the earliest'. 'There is also evidence that wages growth is picking up,' he said. With inflation well above the RBA's two to three per cent target, the word was mentioned 13 times in the May monetary policy meeting statement, issued on Tuesday, with a hint of more rate rises. 'The Board is committed to doing what is necessary to ensure that inflation in Australia returns to target over time,' Dr Lowe said. 'This will require a further lift in interest rates over the period ahead.' More than 1.5million borrowers will be coping with a variable increase for the first time as monthly repayments on a typical $600,000 mortgage rise by $78. Asked about this pain, Mr Morrison said:  'Of course I have sympathy with that.'  Shadow Labor treasurer Jim Chalmers blamed the government even though the Reserve Bank said Russia's Ukraine war had pushed up inflation. 'This is a full blown cost of living crisis on Scott Morrison's watch,' he said. 'The PM has an excuse for everything and a plan for nothing. 'If only you could pay your mortgage with Scott Morrison's excuses.' Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said he respected the Reserve Bank's independence and its decision to withdraw emergency-level support for the economy. 'We don't have an axe to grind with the Reserve Bank,' he said. Dr Lowe said the rate rise wasn't about politics. 'The election has no influence at all on today's decision,' he said. 'We don't take the political situation into account.'  Westpac and its subsidiary St George were the first bank to hint at an increase in variable mortgage rates. 'We are currently reviewing our variable interest rates following the RBA's cash rate decision,' it said. 'We will keep you up to date with any changes here.' $500,000 : Monthly repayments rising by $65 from $1,922 to $1,987 $600,000 : Monthly repayments rising by $78 from $2,306 to $2,384 $700,000 : Monthly repayments rising by $90 from $2,691 to $2,781 $800,000 : Monthly repayments rising by $103 from $3,075 to $3,178 $900,000 : Monthly repayments rising by $116 from $3,459 to $3,575 $1,000,000 : Monthly repayments rising by $130 from $3,843 to $3,973 Data based on variable rate increasing from 2.29 per cent to 2.54 per cent   Last month, the RBA predicted an increase in the cash rate to two per cent - a level unseen since May 2016, would cause a 15 per cent plunge in Australian property prices. CoreLogic research director Tim Lawless is expecting Sydney and Melbourne house prices to dive by 15 per cent in the year ahead, as interest rates keep rising. 'Most of the declines will be concentrated in those two cities because that's where affordability is most stretched and also where, arguably, they'll be facing some demographic headwinds just through interstate migration really favouring the smaller states,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'The counter argument to that is we see overseas borders opening up, we're going to be seeing more migration coming in but that generally tends to flow through to rental demand rather than purchasing demand.' $500,000: Monthly repayments rising by $521 from $1,922 to $2,443 $600,000: Monthly repayments rising by $625 from $2,306 to $2,931 $700,000: Monthly repayments rising by $729 from $2,691 to $3,420 $800,000: Monthly repayments rising by $833 from $3,075 to $3,908 $900,000: Monthly repayments rising by $937 from $3,459 to $4,396 $1,000,000: Monthly repayments rising by $1,042 from $3,843 to $4,885 Data based on variable rate rising from 2.29 per cent to 4.19 per cent before the Reserve Bank of Australia raised the cash rate   Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart and Canberra, along with regional areas in coastal New South Wales, southern Queensland and northern Tasmania were likely to see smaller declines of five to 10 per cent. 'These markets tend to be a little bit more insulated partly because affordability is not quite as stretched,' Mr Lawless said.  Those markets are more affordable than Sydney and Melbourne and would continue to benefit from professionals, who can work from home, moving there.  A 15 per cent fall in Sydney's median house price of $1.417million would take values back to $1.204million - where they were in the middle of last year. A drop of the same magnitude in Melbourne would see the mid-point house price drop from $1.001million to $850,787, which would be the lowest level since May 2017. But with unemployment at just 3.95 per cent, the lowest level since 1974, Mr Lawless said forced sales would be unlikely. 'This will probably more a lack of demand and people looking to sell having to adjust their price expectations,' he said.  A 0.25 percentage point increase will see monthly repayments on a typical $600,000 mortgage to climb by $78, from $2,306 to $2,384. That's based on a bank passing on in full the RBA increasing, pushing up a popular variable rate from 2.29 per cent to 2.54 per cent. ",
  "cd45acdcd9f6b903b400c713744f4b6a85b890295c4462e33ba76247": "The Supreme Court has voted to strike down Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that legalized abortion in the United States, a bombshell report revealed on Monday. The news sent shock waves throughout Washington D.C. with Democrats vowing to codify the legal right to an abortion into law and Republicans demanding an investigation into the leak, claiming it was done to try and influence the high court ahead of its formal ruling.  Perhaps anticipating backlash, the Supreme Court building initially was barricaded Monday night before being watched by security.  Protesters eventually headed toward the gates in large numbers, with some standing up and chanting, while others sat outside the building and lit candles in silence. A small number of counter-protesters also gathered.  The draft opinion - originally obtained by Politico - was written by Justice Samuel Alito, one of the six justices appointed by Republican presidents on the nine-member court, repudiating both Roe and the 1992 Planned Parenthood vs. Casey decision. 'Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,' Alito writes in the draft opinion, which was crafted in February and circulated among the court members. 'We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled,' he continues in the document, titled 'Opinion of the Court.'  'It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected representatives.' Politico reports that, aside from Alito, four other judges voted in favour of overturning the law: Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, all of whom were nominated by Republican presidents.  If the Roe vs Wade ruling is overturned, it would give individual states the power to decide on whether to ban abortion. The Guttmacher Institute, a pro-choice research group, has said that 26 states are 'certain or likely' to ban abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned.  Politico noted that this is the first such case in modern history of a Supreme Court draft decision being leaked to the public while the case was still pending. The draft document is not final until the court formally announces its decision in a case, meaning the ruling could still be changed. Sometimes drafts are circulated by one justice in the hopes of swaying fellow judges. The court is expected to issue its final ruling before its term is up in late June or early July. That led to speculation the Alito draft was leaked ahead in the hopes public outrage could temper the court's decision.  The court, notably, did not deny the legitimacy of the draft opinion. A spokesperson for the Supreme Court said: 'The Court has no comment.'  The Roe v. Wade decision nearly 50 years ago recognised that the right to personal privacy under the US Constitution protects a woman's ability to terminate her pregnancy. On January 22, 1973, the Supreme Court decided that the constitutional right to privacy applied to abortion. Roe was 'Jane Roe,' a pseudonym for Norma McCorvey, a single mother pregnant for the third time, who wanted an abortion. She sued the Dallas attorney general Henry Wade over a Texas law that made it a crime to terminate a pregnancy except in cases of rape or incest, or when the mother's life was in danger. Roe's lawyers said she was unable to travel out of the state to obtain an abortion and argued that the law was too vague and infringed on her constitutional rights. Filing a complaint alongside her was Texas doctor James Hallford, who argued the law's medical provision was vague, and that he was unable to reliably determine which of his patients fell into the allowed category. The 'Does', another couple who were childless, also filed a companion complaint, saying that medical risks made it unsafe but not life-threatening for the wife to carry a pregnancy to term, and arguing they should be able to obtain a safe, legal abortion should she become pregnant. The trio of complaints - from a woman who wanted an abortion, a doctor who wanted to perform them and a non-pregnant woman who wanted the right if the need arose - ultimately reached the nation's top court. The court heard arguments twice, and then waited until after Republican president Richard Nixon's re-election, in November 1972. Only the following January did it offer its historic seven-to-two decision - overturning the Texas laws and setting a legal precedent that has had ramifications in all 50 states. Politico executive editor Dafna Linzer sent a note to staff after the story posted, expressing confidence in the story and their verification of the draft opinion. 'After an extensive review process, we are confident of the authenticity of the draft. ... We take our responsibilities to our readers with the greatest seriousness,' she noted.  Politico posted the entire draft opinion online.  If the Alito decision is adopted, it would return the issue of abortions to the states and over half of the 50 states are likely to ban abortion. Numerous Republican-led states have passed various abortion restrictions in defiance of the Roe precedent in recent years. Republicans could try to enact a nationwide abortion ban, while Democrats could also seek to protect abortion rights at the national level. Twenty-six states are certain or likely to ban abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned, according to the pro-abortion rights think tank the Guttmacher Institute. Of those, 22 states already have total or near-total bans on the books that are currently blocked by Roe, aside from Texas. The state's law banning it after six weeks has already been allowed to go into effect by the Supreme Court due to its unusual civil enforcement structure. Four more states are considered likely to quickly pass bans if Roe is overturned. Sixteen states and the District of Columbia, meanwhile, have protected access to abortion in state law. This year, anticipating a decision overturning or gutting Roe, eight conservative states have already moved to restrict abortion rights. Oklahoma, for example, passed several bills in recent weeks, including one that goes into effect this summer making it a felony to perform an abortion. South Dakota Republican governor Kristi Noem meanwhile said her state would look to ban abortion.  She said: 'If this report is true and Roe v. Wade is overturned, I will immediately call for a special session to save lives and guarantee that every unborn child has a right to life in South Dakota.' Meanwhile, Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, Texas, responded to the news by encouraging the Court to return the issue to the states. 'I hope that #SCOTUS returns the question of abortion where it belongs: the States,' Paxton said on Twitter. 'This is why I led a 24-state coalition in support of MS's law banning them after 15 weeks. I'll [continue] to ensure that TX protects the unborn & pray for the end of abortion across our nation.' The unprecedented leak sent shock waves through the United States, not least because the court prides itself on keeping its internal deliberations secret and leaks are extremely uncommon. The news stunned abortion providers. On Monday night, Andrea Gallegos, executive administrator at Tulsa Women's Clinic in Oklahoma, had just finished calling some 25 patients scheduled for abortions on Tuesday to tell them that their appointments would need to be canceled because of a soon to be enacted Oklahoma law modeled on a highly restrictive Texas abortion ban. 'I can't say that I'm surprised,' she said. 'Now all these other conservative states like Oklahoma are passing the exact same legislation that Texas did, I have to say I became less optimistic and way more scared for what the future of Roe looks like.' The anti-abortion group the Susan B. Anthony List welcomed the news. 'If Roe is indeed overturned, our job will be to build consensus for the strongest protections possible for unborn children and women in every legislature,' said its president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, in a statement. Just hours after the stunning leak of draft opinion emerged, hundreds of pro-choice and anti-abortion activists gathered in front of the US Supreme Court on Monday night. Squaring off on either side of the white marble building a stone's throw from the Capitol, the pro-choice and anti-abortion groups railed at each other. 'Roe v. Wade is going to go,' anti-abortion protesters taunted, while the pro-choice crowd yelled: 'My body, my choice.' The two groups chanted and waved placards in the plaza in front of the steps to the Supreme Court, with barriers and a few uniformed police officers barring access to the colonnaded building. Abby Korb, a 23-year-old graduate student and congressional aide, said she was 'in literal shock' when the news broke and quickly headed to the Supreme Court with a friend. 'I'm a woman and my rights are being taken away every single day,' she said. Like many others at the spontaneous demonstration, Korb, originally from Wisconsin, is now calling for legislation at the federal level to protect access to abortion. 'We need access to safe abortion because making it illegal isn't going to stop it, it's just going to make it more dangerous,' she said. The growing crowd took turns to hurl expletives at Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, who reportedly wrote the opinion, and called on Democratic Party leaders to 'do something'. Madeline Hren, a 25-year-old from North Carolina, said she was very angry. 'I called everyone I knew to be very angry,' she said, holding a small sign with a drawing of a bloody coat hanger that said 'We will not go back.' 'I'm really upset about it... I didn't cry. I'm mostly just mad,' said Hren, who works for the UN Foundation. She now fears that an abortion ban will extend to her native North Carolina. For opponents of the right to abortion, however, it was time to celebrate. 'You don't care if people die,' they sang at the pro-choice crowd. 'I hope they overturn it,' said Claire Rowan, a 55-year-old mother of seven children, some of whom accompanied her to the demonstration. Rowan said she hopes people will now be 'asking God for forgiveness so that the nation can heal.' More than half of all US states have some kind of abortion ban law likely to take effect if Roe v Wade is overturned by the United States Supreme Court.  According to the pro-reproductive rights group The Guttmacher Institute, there are 26 states that will likely make abortions illegal if the Supreme Court overturns the landmark 1973 ruling. 18 have existing abortion bans that have previously been ruled unconstitutional, four have time limit bans and four are likely to pass laws if Roe v Wade is overturned, the organization found. The 18 states that have near-total bans on abortion already on the books are Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.  In addition, Georgia, Iowa, Ohio, and South Carolina all have laws that ban abortions after the six-week mark.  Florida, Indiana, Montana and Nebraska, are likely to pass bills when Roe v Wade is overturned, the Guttmacher Institute said. Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas, West Virginia and Wisconsin's bans all have pre-Roe v Wade laws that became unenforceable after the Supreme Court's 1973 decision - that would kick into effect if the federal legal precedent established in Roe were overturned. Arkansas, Oklahoma, Mississippi and Texas have further bans that will come into effect if the law was overturned. These were passed post-Roe v Wade. They're joined by Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah and Wyoming, in passing such laws.  The states that will limit abortions based on the length of time a patient has been pregnant are Arkansas, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, North Dakota and Ohio. There are four states that have laws that state abortion is not a constitutionally protected right: Alabama, Louisiana, Texas and West Virginia.  Politico reports that four of the five remaining Republican-appointed justices voted with Alito in December, after hearing oral arguments on a Mississippi abortion case. And that line-up remains unchanged as of this week. Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett all voted to strike down Roe.   Democrat-appointed justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan are working on dissents.  What remains unclear his how Chief Justice John Roberts, appointed by George W. Bush, will vote. Sources told CNN that he would've dissented with the liberals on Alito's opinion draft.  But if the justices stand firm, it would not matter how Roberts votes as five back the Alito draft opinion. 'There are lots of signals the opinion is legit,' wrote Supreme Court attorney Neal Katyal on Twitter. 'The length and depth of analysis, would be very hard to fake. It says it is written by Alito and definitely sounds like him. It's 60+ pages long.'   Draft opinions can change and the ruling will not be final until it is published. If the Alito draft is adopted, it would rule in favor of Mississippi in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization - a case involving the state's  attempt to ban most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.  The draft opinion runs 98 pages, including a 31-page appendix of historical state abortion laws, Politico notes in its report. The document is replete with citations to previous court decisions, books and other authorities, and includes 118 footnotes. The appearances and timing of this draft are consistent with court practice.  Politico said only that it received 'a copy of the draft opinion from a person familiar with the court's proceedings in the Mississippi case along with other details supporting the authenticity of the document.'  Katyal described how the Supreme Court handles its decision making process. 'After oral argument the Justices take a tenative vote. This would have happened in December. The senior most justice in the majority gets to assign the opinion. That might have been Roberts, but doubtful since Alito wrote this draft,' he noted on Twitter. 'Now, once the draft is circulated, the justices in dissent will write an opinion. That's presumably happening now. But the tenative vote seems strong, and Chief Justice Roberts is irrelevant if the 4 + Alito hold with their tentative votes,' he added.  If the US Supreme Court votes to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision that legalised abortion nationwide, conservative states will have more confidence that their new limits on abortion will stand while liberal states will feel more urgency to protect and expand abortion rights. Here are some restrictions and protections state legislatures have taken up in 2022: ABORTION RESTRICTIONS ABORTION PROTECTIONS   The unprecedented leak has likely shaken the Supreme Court to its core.  Barricades were being posted around the building shortly after the report was posted online. Posts to social media showed people gathering at the metal fencing, holding candles in vigil.  The highly-respected SCOTUSblog, which covers the court in-depth, noted: 'The document leaked to Politico is almost certainly an authentic draft opinion by J. Alito that reflects what he believes at least 5 members of the Court have voted to support -- overruling Roe. But as Alito's draft, it does not reflect the comments or reactions of other Justices.' 'It's impossible to overstate the earthquake this will cause inside the Court, in terms of the destruction of trust among the Justices and staff. This leak is the gravest, most unforgivable sin,' SCOTUSblog tweeted.  Other observers called it a crisis for Roberts' tenure as chief justice. 'The article represents the greatest crisis that Chief Justice John Roberts has faced in his tenure on the Court,' wrote legal scholar Jonathan Turley. Turley also pointed out the leak happened to put pressure on the court to change its ruling before it's publicly announced.  'The most likely motivation is obviously to pressure the Court and push the legislation in Congress on a federal abortion law before the midterm elections. It will also likely renew the call for court packing,' he added.  And Democratic campaign strategist Brian Fallon tweeted: 'Is a brave clerk taking this unprecedented step of leaking a draft opinion to warn the country what's coming in a last-ditch Hail Mary attempt to see if the public response might cause the Court to reconsider?'  Such a ruling would immediately become an issue in the 2022 midterm election where Democrats are struggling to keep control of Congress.  Abortion would also become a major political issue in governors' races with states being given the right to determine whether or not to allow the procedure.   Both sides of the political aisle immediately jumped on the report with Democrats outraged and Republicans praising the news. 'Abortion care is a fundamental human right and we must legislation like it,' wrote progressive Rep. Ayanna Pressly of Massachusetts on Twitter.  'This is bulls***,' wrote Democratic Senator Tina Smith of Minnesota on Twitter.   'Our daughters, sisters, mothers, and grandmothers will not be silenced. The world is about to hear their fury. California will not sit back. We are going to fight like hell,' wrote Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California.  'The Supreme Court is preparing to overturn Roe - the most significant and glorious news of our lifetime. Join me in praying to God for the right outcome. Life begins at conception. Let's protect it,' tweeted conservative Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia. Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida claimed the leak was done to influence the ruling. 'The next time you hear the far left preaching about how they are fighting to preserve our Republic's institutions & norms remember how they leaked a Supreme Court opinion in an attempt to intimidate the justices on abortion,' he wrote on Twitter.  And Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas called for an investigation of the leak. 'The Supreme Court & the DOJ must get to the bottom of this leak immediately using every investigative tool necessary,' he tweeted.   The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, in September, passed legislation that would codify abortion rights protections amid threats to Roe v. Wade. That bill has been stalled in the 50-50 Senate, where it needs at least 60 votes to move forward. And it may need more than that as not all Democratic senators are guaranteed to vote for such a bill, particularly moderate Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Progressive Senator Bernie Sanders said that 60-vote thresh hold, often called the filibuster, must be removed to legalize abortion. 'Congress must pass legislation that codifies Roe v. Wade as the law of the land in this country NOW. And if there aren't 60 votes in the Senate to do it, and there are not, we must end the filibuster to pass it with 50 votes,' he tweeted on Monday night.   In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court recognized a woman's constitutional right to an abortion in Roe v. Wade. The landmark ruling legalized abortion nationwide but divided public opinion and has been under attack ever since.  The case was filed in 1971 by Norma McCorvey, a 22-year-old living in Texas who was unmarried and seeking a termination of her unwanted pregnancy.  Because of state legislation preventing abortions unless the mother's life is at risk, she was unable to undergo the procedure in a safe and legal environment. So McCorvey sued Henry Wade, the Dallas county district attorney, in 1970. The case went on to the Supreme Court, under the filing Roe vs Wade, to protect McCorvey's privacy. Supreme Court Decision The Supreme Court handed down the watershed 7-2 decision that a woman's right to make her own medical decisions, including the choice to have an abortion, is protected under the 14th Amendment.  In particular, that the Due Process Clause of the the 14th Amendment provides a fundamental 'right to privacy' that protects a woman's liberty to choose whether or not to have an abortion. The landmark ruling saw abortions decriminalized in 46 states, but under certain specific conditions which individual states could decide on. For example, states could decide whether abortions were allowed only during the first and second trimester but not the third (typically beyond 28 weeks).  Impact  Among pro-choice campaigners, the decision was hailed as a victory which would mean fewer women would become seriously - or even fatally - ill from abortions carried out by unqualified or unlicensed practitioners. Moreover, the freedom of choice was considered a significant step in the equality fight for women in the country. Victims of rape or incest would be able to have the pregnancy terminated and not feel coerced into motherhood. However, pro-lifers contended it was tantamount to murder and that every life, no matter how it was conceived, is precious. Though the decision has never been overturned, anti-abortionists have prompted hundreds of states laws since then narrowing the scope of the ruling. One such was the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act signed by President George W. Bush in 2003, which banned a procedure used to perform second-trimester abortions.    Norma McCorvey (Jane Roe) Following the ruling, McCorvey lived a quiet life until the 1980s when she revealed herself to be Jane Roe. McCorvey became a leading, outspoken pro-abortion voice in American discourse, even working at a women's clinic where abortions were performed. However,  she performed an unlikely U-turn in 1995, becoming a born again Christian and began traveling the country speaking out against the procedure. In 2003, a she filed a motion to overturn her original 1973 ruling with the U.S. district court in Dallas. The motion moved through the courts until it was ultimately denied by the Supreme Court in 2005. McCorvey died at an assisted living home in Texas in February 2017, aged 69.  Republicans call the leak of Roe v. Wade draft opinion an effort to 'intimidate' justices into changing their ruling as Democrats promise to 'fight like hell' to stop abortion being banned    Republican lawmakers have celebrated the news of a Supreme Court draft opinion that is set to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision which legalized abortion - but have denounced the leak as an attempt to 'intimidate' the justices into changing their minds. Republicans called it a victory for the social conservatives and Christians who have worked for decades in lockstep to reach this moment. The draft document is not final until the court formally announces its decision in a case, meaning the ruling could technically still be changed. The court is expected to issue its final ruling before its term is up in late June or early July. That led to speculation from some on the right that the Alito draft was leaked in the hopes public outrage could temper the court's decision. Indeed, following its release, several notable Democrats have already slammed the decision, saying they will not abide by it.  One Democratic Representative compared the decision to a dystopian novel, The Handmaid's Tale, while California Gov. Gavin Newsom vowed the state would 'fight like Hell' to oppose the ruling. 'Our daughters, sisters, mothers and grandmothers will not be silenced,' Newsom tweeted Monday night. 'The world is about to hear their fury.' Mike Gibbons, who is currently facing Trump-endorsed candidate JD Vance in the Republican primary for an Ohio Senate seat, wrote that the decision marked a 'huge pro-life victory,' noting it's 'great to see the Court recognize all life is protected under the Constitution. 'We still have to make sure we elect candidates that will continue to defend the unborn, which is exactly what I'll do in the U.S. Senate. Others, though, raised doubts about why the opinion was leaked to POLITICO, with Marco Rubio writing: 'The next time you hear the far left preaching about how they are fighting to preserve our Republic's institutions and norms remember how they leaked a Supreme Court opinion in an attempt to intimidate the justices on abortion.' Republican Josh Hawley, of Missouri, also tweeted that the leak is 'an unprecedented breach of confidentiality, clearly meant to intimidate.' 'The Justices mustn't give in to this attempt to corrupt the process,' Hawley wrote. 'Stay strong.' Embattled Congressmember Madison Cawthorn also tweeted that the story 'was meant to intimidate the Supreme Court into backing down.' 'Pray for the end of Roe v. Wade. Pray the Court will defend innocent life. Pray the Court will stand strong,' he urged his followers, noting:  'Evil MUST not triumph. Science, common sense, and LIFE will win.' On the left, Democrats and abortion rights activists slammed the decision - saying it is a 'nightmare scenario' as they vowed to fight the ruling. In a statement following the news, Planned Parenthood CEO Jodi Hicks said: 'This is the nightmare scenario we in the reproductive health, rights, and justice space have been sounding the alarm about and especially once the U.S. Supreme Court had a conservative majority. 'And now, if this opinion truly is reflective of the final decision of the majority of the U.S. Supreme Court Justices, then even if abortion remains legal today, we are just days away from more than 26 states banning access to abortion services, essential and safe health care that has been a constitutional right for nearly 50 years.' 'Make no mistake about it, the plan has always been to ban and criminalize abortion ever since 1973 when Roe v. Wade was decided,' she claimed. 'If the report is accurate, the Supreme Court is poised to inflict the greatest restriction of rights in the past fifty years - not just on women but on all Americans,' Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a joint statement. 'The Republican-appointed Justices' reported votes to overturn Roe v. Wade would go down as an abomination, one of the worst and most damaging decisions in modern history.' They also used the opportunity to slam former President Trump, saying: 'Several of these conservative justices, who are in no way accountable to the American people, have lied to the US Senate, ripped up the Constitution and defiled both precedent and the Supreme Court's reputation - all at the expense of tens of millions of women who could be stripped of their bodily autonomy and the Constitutional rights they've relied on for half a century. 'The party of Lincoln and Eisenhower has now completely devolved into the party of Trump,' the two top Congressional Democrats continued, adding: 'Every Republican Senator who supported Sen. McConnell and voted for Trump justices pretending that this day would never come will now have to explain themselves to the American people.' And Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton also tweeted Monday night she is 'not surprised' by the news. 'This decision is a direct assault on the dignity, rights and lives of women, not to mention decades of settled law,' she wrote. 'It will kill and subjugate women even as a vast majority of Americans think abortion should be legal.  'What an utter disgrace.' Many have now said they would fight the decision if it were passed - either at the federal or the state level.  In New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy reminded his followers that he signed into law the Freedom of Reproductive Choice Act, which codifies the right to an abortion into New Jersey law. 'New Jersey will not go backwards on reproductive rights,' he wrote in a tweet. Meanwhile, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said abortions rights would not be overturned 'on my watch,' and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul also promised that 'abortion will always be safe and accessible in New York,' saying it will welcome anyone who says they need an abortion 'with open arms.' 'I refuse to let my new granddaughter have to fight for the rights that generations have fought for & won, rights that she should be guaranteed,' Hochul tweeted. At the same time, New York Attorney General Letitia James also promised in a tweet to 'do everything in our power to protect the right to an abortion' adding, 'Congress must act immediately to do the same.' And in Michigan, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said she will 'fight like hell to make sure abortion remains safe, legal and accessible in our state.' On the progressive end , woke Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, meanwhile, noted that Sen. Joe Manchin is preventing a vote on codifying abortion rights into law, while Sen. Bernie Sanders suggested ending the filibuster to get it passed. Sen. Elizabeth Warren also branded the Supreme Court 'extremist' in a tweet saying it will 'impose its far-right, unpopular views on the entire country. 'It's time for the millions who support the Constitution and abortion rights to stand up and make their voices heard,' Warren wrote. 'We're not going back--not ever.' Maryland Democrat Rep. Jamie Raskin, meanwhile, warned that Alito's decision could also lead to bans on birth control as he claimed the decision is reminiscent of The Handmaid's Tale. He was referring to the novel by Margaret Atwood - which was later turned into a television show. In both iterations, women are forced by the state to give birth. 'The basic legal claim here is that the word 'abortion' doesn't appear in the Constitution, and of course it doesn't appear in the Constitution,' Raskin, a Constitutional lawyer, explained to MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Monday night. 'But the Supreme Court in 1973, in Roe v. Wade or Griswold v. Connecticut - which was a 1965 decision by the Supreme Court striking down a law banning birth control, even for married couples in Connecticut - the Supreme Court said that the due process liberty clause include a right to privacy, over intimate decision making. 'So the point is that Justice Alito's decision would also apply, presumably, to the right to privacy in contraception,' he continued. 'If Casey is to fall, if Roe v. Wade is to fall, then Griswold v. Connecticut presumably is to follow as well because the word 'contraception' or 'birth control' doesn't appear in the Constitution [either].  'So this would appear to be an invitation to have Handmaid's Tale-type anti-feminist regulation and legislation all over the country,' Raskin concluded.  Roe vs Wade: The Texas mother who won the landmark 1973 case but then became a fierce opponent of abortion rights - and her 'Roe Baby' daughter who finally revealed her identity last year  The original Roe v. Wade case was brought in 1971 by Norma McCorvey, a 22-year-old living in Texas who was unmarried and seeking a termination of her unwanted pregnancy.  She married at the age of 16, but separated shortly after while she was pregnant. She gave custody of her daughter to her mother.  She gave a second child up for adoption, but when she got pregnant a third time she decided to have an abortion.  She said she couldn't afford to travel to one of the handful of states where it would have been legal. Because of state legislation preventing abortions unless the mother's life is at risk, she was unable to undergo the procedure in a safe and legal environment. So McCorvey sued Henry Wade, the Dallas county district attorney, in 1970. The case went on to the Supreme Court, under the filing Roe vs Wade, to protect McCorvey's privacy. Sarah Weddington and  a former classmate, Linda Coffee, brought a class-action lawsuit on behalf of a pregnant woman challenging a state law that largely banned abortions. She had been among only five women out of a class of 1,600 to graduate with a law degree from the University of Texas in 1967.  The Supreme Court handed down the watershed 7-2 decision that a woman's right to make her own medical decisions, including the choice to have an abortion, is protected under the 14th Amendment.  In particular, that the Due Process Clause of the the 14th Amendment provides a fundamental 'right to privacy' that protects a woman's liberty to choose whether or not to have an abortion. The landmark ruling saw abortions decriminalized in 46 states, but under certain specific conditions which individual states could decide on. For example, states could decide whether abortions were allowed only during the first and second trimester but not the third (typically beyond 28 weeks).

However, she performed an unlikely U-turn in 1995, becoming a born-again Christian and began traveling the country speaking out against the procedure. In 2003, a she filed a motion to overturn her original 1973 ruling with the U.S. district court in Dallas. The motion moved through the courts until it was ultimately denied by the Supreme Court in 2005. McCorvey died at an assisted living home in Texas in February 2017, aged 69. She admitted before she died that she made the change in exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars. This is my deathbed confession,' she says. 'I took their money and they took me out in front of the cameras and told me what to say. That's what I'd say.'  In the interview, McCorvey refers to herself as 'the Big Fish' in the eyes of evangelical leaders who were eager to have her publicly switch sides and take up their cause.  In addressing her activism for the religious right, McCorvey boasts: 'I'm a good actress.' Shelley Lynn Thornton, now 51, is the biological daughter of Norma McCorvey and spoke on the record for the first time in 2021. Shelley appeared on Good Morning America for her first ever TV interview. Her identity was only made public in September by The Atlantic.   'A lot of people didn't know I existed,' she said, adding she fears the world blames her for abortion being legal.  'It doesn't revolve around me, I wasn't the one who created this law. I'm not the one who created this movement. I had nothing to do with it. I was just a little itty-bitty thing and, you know, circumstances prevailed.  'My whole thinking is that, 'oh God everybody is going to hate me because everyone is going to blame me for abortion being legal,' she said.  Thornton, who never met her birth mother in person before her death in 2017, told journalist Joshua Prager she had decided to speak out after more than half a century because she wanted to free herself from the 'secrets and lies.' 'Secrets and lies are, like, the two worst things in the whole world. I'm keeping a secret, but I hate it,' she said, in an adapted excerpt from Prager's new book 'The Family Roe: An American Story', published in The Atlantic.   'I want everyone to understand that this is something I've chosen to do.'   In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court recognized a woman's constitutional right to an abortion in Roe v. Wade. The landmark ruling legalized abortion nationwide but divided public opinion and has been under attack ever since.  The case was filed in 1971 by Norma McCorvey, a 22-year-old living in Texas who was unmarried and seeking a termination of her unwanted pregnancy.  Because of state legislation preventing abortions unless the mother's life is at risk, she was unable to undergo the procedure in a safe and legal environment. So McCorvey sued Henry Wade, the Dallas county district attorney, in 1970. The case went on to the Supreme Court, under the filing Roe vs Wade, to protect McCorvey's privacy. Supreme Court Decision The Supreme Court handed down the watershed 7-2 decision that a woman's right to make her own medical decisions, including the choice to have an abortion, is protected under the 14th Amendment.  In particular, that the Due Process Clause of the the 14th Amendment provides a fundamental 'right to privacy' that protects a woman's liberty to choose whether or not to have an abortion. The landmark ruling saw abortions decriminalized in 46 states, but under certain specific conditions which individual states could decide on. For example, states could decide whether abortions were allowed only during the first and second trimester but not the third (typically beyond 28 weeks).  Impact  Among pro-choice campaigners, the decision was hailed as a victory which would mean fewer women would become seriously - or even fatally - ill from abortions carried out by unqualified or unlicensed practitioners. Moreover, the freedom of choice was considered a significant step in the equality fight for women in the country. Victims of rape or incest would be able to have the pregnancy terminated and not feel coerced into motherhood. However, pro-lifers contended it was tantamount to murder and that every life, no matter how it was conceived, is precious. Though the decision has never been overturned, anti-abortionists have prompted hundreds of states laws since then narrowing the scope of the ruling. One such was the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act signed by President George W. Bush in 2003, which banned a procedure used to perform second-trimester abortions.    Norma McCorvey (Jane Roe) Following the ruling, McCorvey lived a quiet life until the 1980s when she revealed herself to be Jane Roe.

  "3f4d672403d9715127592b46b7895df45dfc6d2aff2e3bb379ac6cec": "Mary Beard has revealed she stumbled across porn while searching for historical paintings on Google, days after shamed Tory MP Neil Parish admitted to finding adult content while searching for tractors.  The classicist was shocked to end up on a porn website after searching for portraits of Roman emperors by Italian painter Titian.  Professor Beard said the revelation was not meant as support for Mr Parish, who resigned on Sunday after admitting to looking at pornography twice in the House of Commons.  Friends of the Devon MP claim he had been searching for 'Dominator' combine harvesters when he opened a link to an adult website, something that was witnessed by another MP. However, he admitted he then looked at adult content deliberately a second time while in the House, while Beard says she avoided going back for a second look. Writing on Twitter on Monday, May 2, she said: 'This is not meant as a support for Mr Parish but I have ended up on a porn site after searching for Titian's Caesar portraits. A shock and I left pronto! The 67-year-old added she didn't go back to it later and it has 'a bit put me off searching for Titian in general!' She wrote: 'I have given up search Titian! Too dangerous.' The Eleven Caesars are a series of portraits depicting 11 of Rome's most famous leaders which were created by Titian between 1536 and 1540. None of these portraits have any nudity, although some other works by the Renaissance artist do depict nude and semi-nude women, as was common at the time. Tiziano Vecellio, better known as Titian, was an Italian painter who was prolific in the 16th century. Born in the Italian Alps, he was sent to Venice as a child where he learned his craft from painter Giovanni Bellini.  Even during his lifetime Titian's works were praised by critics and fellow artists. Like many artists of the day, his includes nude and semi-nude depictions of women. Among these are Sacred and Profane Love, which shows two women, one dressed and one nude, which are thought to represent Venus.  His painting, Venus of Urbino, which depicts a reclining woman who is nude, is considered to be among the most beautiful of its type. The Renaissance artist also painted more religious paintings, including Assumption, which depicts Mary the mother of Jesus ascending to heaven. Titian was also a master of portraits and was commissioned by many of Italian society's aristocrats.  In this style he also created the Eleven Caesars, a series of 11 portraits of Roman emperors including Julius Caesar, Augustus and Nero. It comes days after Mr Parish, who has been the MP for Tiverton and Honiton since 2010, announced he would resign over the porn scandal that has embroiled him over the last week.  The 65-year-old, who was a farmer before becoming an MP, was seen viewing X-rated material on two occasions in the House of Commons. It is claimed the first of these incidents took place when he searched for 'Dominator' combine harvesters, which are a wide-used brand of farm vehicle.  Devon county councillor Colin Slade told The Telegraph he 'could see' how the search might have led to inappropriate content, arguing: 'I have never had any concerns about his behaviour and I regard Neil as totally truthful. 'I saw his BBC interview, which was very heartfelt, in which he said he was wrong and he was sorry.' Mr Slade's suggestion has not yet been confirmed by Mr Parish, though the former Tory MP did say he was looking at tractors when he stumbled upon adult content.   The married father-of-two had previously vowed to continue as the MP for Tiverton and Honiton after it was revealed he was the politician seen watching porn by two Conservative colleagues, but finally bowed to pressure to resign on Sunday. He said in an interview with BBC South West that he recognised the 'furore' and 'damage' he was causing his family and his constituency in Devon before deciding 'it just wasn't worth carrying on'. 'The situation was, funnily enough it was tractors I was looking at, so I did get into another website with sort of a very similar name and I watched it for a bit, which I shouldn't have done,' Mr Parish said. 'My crime, my most biggest crime, is that on another occasion I went in a second time, and that was deliberate. 'I was wrong what I was doing, but this idea that I was there watching it, intimidating women, I mean I have 12 years in Parliament and probably got one of the best reputations ever - or did have.' When pressed on why he chose to view the material in the Commons, he said: 'I don't know, I think I must've taken complete leave of my senses and my sensibilities and my sense of decency, everything.' 'I thought that I could explain to the standards committee what happened and it would be worth explaining what happened which I will in a minute.' He added: 'What I do want to put on record is that for all my rights and wrongs, I was not proud of what I was doing. The one thing I wasn't doing and which I will take to my grave as being true is I was not actually making sure people could see it. 'In fact, I was trying to do quite the opposite. I was wrong what I was doing, but this idea that I was there watching it and intimidating women.' He continued: 'Total madness. I'm not going to defend it. I'm also not going to defend what I did. What I did was absolutely, totally wrong. In the end, what do you do?' He told the BBC that he and his wife discussed fighting it in some way yesterday morning. 'I was wrong. I searched my conscience and that's why I'm here this afternoon. I'm not trying to be virtuous about it in any shape or form. I was wrong. I was stupid. I lost a sense of mind. 'What is done is done. What I am saying is one can use process to delay and hold things up. I decided not to.' He was suspended by the Conservatives on Friday under investigation after confirming that he was the MP who had been seen watching the material. His resignation will trigger a by-election in the South West seat of Tiverton and Honiton in Devon which has a Consrvative majority of over 14,000.",
  "9ab9fa38f45124a528639dfbe6f5226b93da3b11951c4f3d4458d16f": "Russia has doubled down and accused Israel of supporting neo-Nazis in Ukraine in a bitter row sparked by Sergei Lavrov's comments that Adolf Hitler had 'Jewish blood'. Israel slammed the Russian foreign minister yesterday, saying his claim - made when talking about Volodymyr Zelensky who is Jewish - was an 'unforgivable' falsehood that debased the horrors of the Nazi Holocaust.  Lavrov said: 'I think that Hitler also had Jewish origins, so it means nothing. For a long time now we've been hearing the wise Jewish people say that the biggest anti-Semites are the Jews themselves.'  Lavrov's comments sparked fury around the world, with Zelensky condemning the 'anti-Semitic' remarks which showed 'Moscow has forgotten all the lessons from World War II'. Yair Lapid, Israel's foreign minister, also branded the remark 'scandalous' and said the Russian ambassador would be summoned for a 'tough talk'.  But in a statement today, the Russian foreign ministry said Lapid's comments were 'anti-historical' and 'explaining to a large extent why the current Israeli government supports the neo-Nazi regime in Kyiv'. Moscow reiterated Lavrov's point that Zelensky's Jewish origins did not preclude Ukraine from being run by neo-Nazis. 'Anti-Semitism in everyday life and in politics is not stopped and is on the contrary nurtured (in Ukraine),' it said in a statement. Lavrov made the Hitler assertion on Italian television on Sunday when he was asked why Russia said it needed to 'denazify' Ukraine if the country's own president, Volodymyr Zelensky, was himself Jewish. Israel has expressed support for Ukraine following the Russian invasion in February.  But wary of damaging relations with Russia, a powerbroker in neighbouring Syria, it initially avoided direct criticism of Moscow and has not enforced formal sanctions on Russian oligarchs. But ties have grown more strained, with Lapid last month accusing Russia of committing war crimes in Ukraine. He said yesterday: 'It is an unforgivable, scandalous statement, a terrible historical mistake, and we expect an apology.'  Dani Dayan, chairman of Yad Vashem, Israel's memorial to the six million Jews killed in the Holocaust, said the Russian minister's remarks were 'an insult and a severe blow to the victims of the real Nazism'. Speaking on Kan radio, Dayan said Lavrov was spreading 'an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory with no basis in fact'. The identity of one of Hitler's grandfathers is not known but there has been some speculation - without evidence - that he might have been a Jew.  Lapid added that accusing Jews of being anti-Semites themselves was 'the lowest level of racism'. He also dismissed Lavrov's claim that pro-Nazi elements held sway over the Ukrainian government and military. 'The Ukrainians aren't Nazis. Only the Nazis were Nazis and only they dealt with the systematic destruction of the Jewish people,' said Lapid, whose grandfather died in the Holocaust. The Ukrainian president has also run into flak in Israel by looking to draw analogies between the conflict in his country and World War Two. In an address to the Israeli parliament in March, Zelensky compared the Russian offensive in Ukraine to Nazi Germany's extermination of European Jewry during World War Two. Yad Vashem called his comments 'irresponsible,' saying they trivialised the historical facts of the Holocaust.  During Israel's annual Holocaust memorial day last week, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett appeared to be referencing Zelensky when he urged world leaders not to compare current events to the Nazi genocide. 'I take the trouble to say this because as the years go by, there is more and more discourse in the world that compares other events to the Holocaust,' he said. 'But no. Even the most difficult wars today are not the Holocaust and are not comparable to the Holocaust,' he said.",
  "d0c1d1d9d0503b7a9c7e227d38b41f16c3448fee5c99b4f2454dc768": "A former BBC star has branded the broadcaster 'soul destroying' for the 'hoops' it makes people jump through to get a show greenlit - adding that his podcast fronted by two men would have 'no chance' in today's woke era. Simon Mayo, 63, hosted an acclaimed film review show for more than two decades with Mark Kermode, 58, on various BBC channels, before recently moving it to Sony. Mayo suggested it would now be impossible for the BBC to take on his show, given that it would be fronted by 'two middle-aged men'.  He told Radio Times: 'The truth of the matter is, if you were going to start a new film show on the BBC right now there would be no chance of me and Mark being asked to do it.' Kermode and Mayo's Film Review first hit the airwaves in the mid-1990s on Radio 1, before jumping around the corporation's different frequencies. The BBC continued to air the show even after Mayo left BBC Radio 2 for Scala Radio in 2019. But Sony will now produce the review programme as a twice-weekly podcast called Kermode & Mayo's Take. Mayo said they decided to take their show elsewhere to 'make it better.' 'When Sony come along and say, 'we will invest in this programme in a way that it hasn't been invested in so far' you think, that's interesting,' he said. 'For instance, we did a very successful short-film competition called Well Done U.  'The quality of the entries was brilliant, but there are so many BBC hoops to jump through to actually get something like that on the air that after a while people stop trying, because it's soul destroying. 'This way we'll be able to bring things like that back.' Mayo also blasted the BBC for making him call a separate podcast version of the show a 'download'. 'At 5 Live it became a podcast before either of us knew what a podcast was,' he said. 'There were very strict rules at the time saying you could only put on the podcast what was broadcast on the radio, plus 10 per cent. 'At first, the BBC said it can't be called a podcast because that would be advertising for Apple. You've got to call it a download. 'They thought they could decide what things were called. Language doesn't work like that.' Mayo's comments come after the BBC has lost some of its biggest stars in a flurry of departures this year.  Last month, the corporation dismissed the 'brain drain' of top talent ditching the broadcaster as 'people come, people go' after Dan Walker became the latest to join a rival firm. Insiders said there was always a 'natural point where people move on' but there were mounting fears the Corporation will be left with a lack of experienced presenters. Walker announced he was joining Channel 5 to be lead anchor on its revamped 5News team - as he announced today that he has just two weeks left with the corporation.  He will walk away from his PS295,000-295,999 a year role at the Beeb, with industry experts suggesting he will make around PS350,000 in his new job. The Breakfast presenter followed a string of huge names - including Jon Sopel, Emily Maitlis and Andrew Marr - which sparked fears of an escalating exodus of talent. His former Breakfast co-star Louise Minchin also left last year as she looked to spend more quality time with her family. Maitlis, Sopel and Marr jumped ship for LBC in a golden handcuffs deal expected to earn them huge pay rises. The journalists caused disarray at Broadcasting House after deciding to join Global, which is also home to Nick Ferrari, Shelagh Fogarty and James O'Brien. Maitlis, who hosted Newsnight, had a series of impartiality complaints against her because of her tweets and on-air comments about the pandemic. Marr is said to have admitted he was prompted to leave the BBC because of his desire to speak freely on major issues, including climate change and politics. Leading presenters Andrew Neil and Simon McCoy have also left the BBC in the past year. The deal, for a new show and podcast, is likely to lead to a salary uplift for Sopel and Maitlis, who earn at least PS235,000 and PS325,000 respectively at the BBC. An LBC insider told MailOnline Maitlis will now be on 'at least' PS400,000-a-year, with Mr Sopel likely to be through the PS300,000-a-year barrier. But they warned it 'could be more' because of the number of projects they will work on together. Leaving the BBC will also allow them to pursue more cash from speaking events and private functions worth another PS50,000 annually. Another insider said: 'I think it's the potent appeal of money and freedom to be more expressive in their personal views than the BBC allows'. The deal will see them front a major new podcast for Global Player, as well as hosting a show together on LBC and providing commentary and analysis for lbc.co.uk.",
  "043c1d8e99113cceb18b32b4d8181e75f7c3502ec936917f86f9dc8d": "New York's mayor Eric Adams appeared at the Met Gala on Monday night wearing a tuxedo on which was written 'End gun violence' along with a drawing of a handgun encircled in a 'no' symbol. Although well-intentioned, the symbolism quickly drew mockery online with viewers responding with sarcasm that the problem of gun crime was suddenly fixed.   Adams, 61, and his partner Tracey Collins arrived together as photographers snapped the couple as they walked up the famous carpeted steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Adam's tux also had the symbol for the N train prominently displayed in what was a clear reference to last month's mass shooting on a crowded subway train in Brooklyn in which 23 people were hurt.  Adams, who is in his first-term as mayor campaigned on mandate of public safety and has been under pressure to curb violence in the city.  Yet, in the first three months of this year, there have been 291 shootings in the city, up from 252 over the same period last year, according to NYPD statistics. In March alone, the city reported 115 shooting incidents - more than 16% increase from March 2021.  'The goal is to end gun violence and save our children,' Adams said as he pointed out the various subway lines visible on the jacket: 'Here's my Q train, my 3 train, my N train, my A train.'  The piece was designed by Laolu Senbanjo, a Nigerian lawyer-turned-artist now based in Brooklyn.  'Bringing a little swagger back to the #MetGala. Honored to be here,' Adams tweeted, alongside a number of pictures. The jacket did not appear to impress viewers online who did not feel as though its message would make any difference to the city's skyrocketing gun crime statistics.  'End gun violence? Isn't that HIS job?' asked on Twitter user.   'Yeah this will bring felonies down,' joked another. 'Symbolism rarely if ever brings crime under control, cogent solutions do,' said one. 'Bravo! Way to do nothing about the problem,' wrote one sarcastically.   Earlier in the day, Adams was seen having a pedicure ahead of highlight of the city's fashion calendar. Video posted to Twitter showed the mayor completely barefoot while sitting in a chair at the Cuccio Nail Salon in Washington Heights in Manhattan as his feet were seen to.  'The Met Ball -- so we'll make sure I have a pedi done before I go,' Adams joked.  Adams received his treatment at 2pm on Monday afternoon. A spokesman confirmed that the mayor did not have his nails painted.  The Met Gala's theme for this year is 'Gilded glamour, white-tie,' guests have were told.  Adams appears to enjoy mingling in the fashion world. He attended New York Fashion Week in February where he was seated next to Anna Wintour. Former presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton was in a Bordeaux-colored gown designed by Joseph Altuzarra with the names of historic women sewn into the hem and neckline.  They include Madeline Albright, Abigail Adams, Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, Lady Bird Johnson, and Clinton's mother, Dorothy Rodham. Clinton's last Met Gala was a while ago. 'I told Anna I would come every 20 years,' she said. The former First Lady and Secretary of State is said to have drawn inspiration for her dress from the women of America's past whom she admires. 'I would've filled the entire dress,' Clinton said. 'We decided to stick with women who were no longer with us. 'It also reflected Joseph's interest in what were called 'friendship quilts' that women used to embroider sayings or phrases or their names of family or friends,' she explained.   Altuzarra's handwriting was used to write the names of women which was then embroidered by hang onto the maroon gown. 'I knew that I wanted the dress to have a personal component for her,' Altuzarra told Vogue.  'When someone like Hillary goes to the Met, it's not just like, 'there's Hillary at the Met and she's wearing a dress.' It has a lot of significance. I felt like I had to be very thoughtful about what the dress would mean to the theme and to the occasion.'",
  "f7411bb0c562d2daae3f5afce3d1169de2e64fe4aabc77b4e232c4f4": "Guy Sebastian only suspected his long-time manager Titus Day had embezzled money from him after the chart-topping singer had ended their business relationship, a court has heard.  Sebastian examined financial records after that bitter split and allegedly discovered 'anomalies' which have resulted in Day being accused of embezzling almost $1million, the court heard.     The Australian Idol winner is set to give evidence against Day at a trial which commenced before 15 jurors at the Downing Centre District Court in Sydney on Tuesday.  Day has pleaded not guilty to 50 charges of embezzlement as a clerk or servant, and 50 alternative counts of stealing. The charges relate to about $900,000 in allegedly missing royalties and performance fees. The Crown claims Day received the payments to his client, but rather than forwarding the money to Sebastian, kept it for his own purposes. It took 50 minutes just to read out the indictments and for Day to formally enter his pleas.  The amounts of money the 49-year-old is alleged to have embezzled range from $593 in royalties to $187,524 in performance fees. One charge concerns a $21,000 ambassadorship.  The trial is expected to last five weeks and comes two years after Day's arrest when he was charged with misappropriating the money from Sebastian between 2013 and 2020.   Prosecutor David Morters SC opened his case by describing Sebastian to the jury as a high-profile recording artist and performer 'whose name you're probably all familiar with'.  The court heard Day, who has also represented television presenters Sophie Monk and Grant Denyer, was entrusted to manage Sebastian's income while the pair worked together.  Mr Morters said Day, a qualified lawyer, had been in the entertainment industry since the early 1990s and had first managed Sebastian in 2007 while working for 22 Management, run by Sean Anderson. Sebastian had about nine months left on a three-year contract when Day approached him in July 2009 to join his own new company 6 Degrees. Mr Morters said Sebastian agreed to move to 6 Degrees without signing a contract but had an agreement with Day under which the agent was to receive a 20 per cent commission.  Day managed Sebastian until November 2017 when the singer terminated their arrangement. 'The break-up was acrimonious, or hostile,' Mr Morters said. The court heard Sebastian subsequently found 'anomalies' in financial records suggesting he was still owed payments by Day and in July 2018 the performer launched a civil claim against him. Day made a counter claim against Sebastian alleging he was owed money, which led to an examination of Day's banking records allegedly revealing further anomalies, the court heard. Mr Morters said Sebastian learnt 6 Degrees had received payments for copyright royalties and performances which he had never received. Sebastian then went to police and Day was arrested at his eastern suburbs home in July 2020. The ARIA Award-winner will likely be in the witness box for several days under cross-examination after giving his evidence in chief.  His wife Jules and brother Jeremy will also give evidence, along with Sebastian's accountants and representatives of companies with which he did business.  Sean Anderson is set to be called as a witness, as is Gordon Pitt, general manager of legal and business affairs at Sony Music, and Damien Luscombe, partner at White Sky Music accounting services.  Rebecca Oxenbould, who manages the The Sebastian Foundation charity, will be giving testimony.  Sebastian won the first series of Australian Idol in 2003 over Shannon Noll, another former Day client. The 40-year-old is currently on tour to promote his recent T.R.U.T.H. album and is appearing as a judge on Network Seven's latest series of The Voice. ",

In a shocking twist to a tragic day, stunned relatives carrying the coffin of Rosa Isabel Cespede Callaca, 36, opened it and found their relative with her eyes open looking at them. Rosa and the coffin were rushed to nearby Referential Hospital Ferrenafe on the back of a pickup truck where she was quickly hooked up to a life support machine. Sheepish medics confirmed that she did have vital signs - albeit very low ones - and her condition improved slightly once on life support, giving hope that a miracle was in progress. But Rosa's condition then rapidly deteriorated and she passed away a few hours later.  Cemetery caretaker Juan Segundo Cajo said: '[She] opened her eyes and was sweating. I immediately went to my office and called the police.'  A video taken shortly after the astounding discovery shows a team of police carrying the coffin through a crowd to a pickup truck. The video then cuts to a team of medics standing over the open coffin with an unconscious Rosa at their feet.  Rosa had been in a serious car crash on a road in the Chiclayo-Picsi region which claimed the life of her brother-in-law and seriously injured her nephews. She too had been pronounced dead after the crash and her relatives had arranged a funeral for her on April 26 in the city of Lambayque. Her relatives expressed predictable outrage that Rosa had been declared dead and sent to the morgue for a funeral 'in the first place'.  An unnamed aunt furious with the hospital said: 'We want to know why my niece reacted yesterday, when we were taking her to be buried. 'We have the videos in which she pushes and touches the coffin.' It has been speculated that the medics at the Referential Hospital Ferrenafe where she had been taken initially after the crash had mistaken a coma for being dead. Police are now investigating whether staff at the hospital negligently took Rosa off life support, pronounced her dead and sent her to the morgue without proper review to check that she was actually dead. Rosa's three nephews, who were injured in the same crash as she, are said to be recovering in hospital but still in a serious condition. ",
  "ae0bc0745a5cbf10d7118e7d0568fe5de5816c169503ba07763604fb": "The parents of severely autistic Lacey Ellen Fletcher who died 'fused' to a sofa by her own excrement were arrested on Monday and face life in jail after a grand jury indicted them on second-degree murder charges. DailyMail.com has obtained jail mugshots of Clay, 65, and Sheila, 64, taken shortly after they were picked up by sheriff's deputies and hauled off to East Feliciana Parish Jail in Clinton. Louisiana. Sheriff Jeffery Travis told DailyMail.com: 'We picked them up, arrested them, brought them to the jail and we're in the process of booking them in. 'Their bond is not my purview. The judge sets the bond and she will work with their attorney for that. I'd say the bond will be really high.' DailyMail.com understands that the couple's bond is unlikely to be set for a few days. That means under Louisiana state law that Sheila Fletcher is likely to be moved to a prison until at least the bond issue is sorted because there is a time limit that females can be held in jail. Her husband Clay will remain in the parish jail. The first arraignment is expected to be in around two to three weeks. In a horrific scene, Lacey's emaciated body was discovered partially naked, sitting upright and partly submerged in a hole in a couch covered from head to toe in urine, liquid feces, maggots and insect bites at her parents' otherwise neat single family home in Slaughter on January 3. Her feet were crossed underneath her on the couch deep inside the hole that her long-suffering body had worn through both the upholstery and cushion. Dr Ewell Bickham III said she had been stuck on the couch for at least 12 years. Additionally it has been reported that Lacey had fecal matter shoved on her face, chest and abdomen. Her hair was matted, knotted and filled with maggots - and she weighed less than 100lbs. Arrest warrants for the Fletchers were prepared immediately after the grand jury decision.  East Feliciana Parish Coroner Dr Ewell Bickham III told DailyMail.com Monday that the images of the conditions Lacey was found in were so horrific and upsetting that medics would be on standby for the members of the jury.  He added that the photos of the scene left those in the room speechless. 'When I was presenting the case and showed the pictures and gave the timeline the expressions of the grand jury was utter shock,' he said. 'Like the clock on the wall never moved again.' 'There was complete silence. Some jurors were gasping in horror. Some were staring in disbelief.' Bickham also told the DailyMail.com that the case has been really hard on him personally and described Monday's grand jury proceedings as 'long emotional day.' 'Seeing those photos again and reliving this traumatic experience again was really hard.' Outside the court, District Attorney D'Aquilla said: 'I believe justice was served here today. Lacey Fletcher didn't deserve the way she was treated. 'For this type of crime... second degree is the highest charge that could have been produced today.' The Fletchers were arrested on Monday afternoon.  Dr Bickham revealed that Lacey had been on the couch for at least 12 years.  'Evidence wise, a minimum of 12 years,' he said. 'Could be before that. At least 12 years. A terribly long period of time.' The coroner also revealed the full horrific cause of death. He said: 'The cause of death stemmed from severe medical neglect, which led to chronic malnutrition, acute starvation, immobility, acute ulcer formation, osteomyelitis which is bone infection which led finally to sepsis.' Dr Bickham also cleared up a misunderstanding about Lacey's actual condition, originally reported as 'Locked-In' Syndrome. He said: 'I don't know where that term came from or what source it came from. In all my years as a practicing physician I have never heard of that term. 'The only diagnoses that I know she did have was first, social anxiety, severe autism and that's it. Those are her only two diagnoses. 'The last time she saw a physician of any type or any kind was when she was 16 years old. That picture of her was when she was 16.' DA D'Aquilla agreed Lacey's death was a 'crime against humanity' and added: 'I hope this indictment brings some spotlight to victims of this type of crime. 'The coroner has a lot of authority, a lot of power. If people don't want to get treatment or they refuse treatment, go to the coroner's office, go to law enforcement, check on your neighbors, check on your friends. If you are a care giver, reach out and make sure people are taken care of. 'This case was so horrific that the coroner and the sheriff's office initially investigated this case in January and the conditions that she was found it was just unbelievable. 'You don't treat anybody of any animals like that. Something had to be done and we all got together, we all stood on the same platform and we are all here now and we have an indictment for second degree murder.' Sheriff Travis added: 'It was nothing short of horrific and sickening. We all collectively worked together to reach the point that we are at now. This is a case that is rare, but today everything was done correctly by every member of this team and we successfully reached a conviction(sic) that we believe is going to being justice for Lacey's situation. WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGE  The Fletchers, considered outwardly respectable and pillars of their community, were not at the courthouse and have not been seen since news broke last week of the horror. They were not immediately arrested because they were not considered flight risks. DailyMail.com understands Sheila Fletcher rang 911 at 2am on January 3 to report her daughter had stopped breathing. The sheriff's office sent a deputy to the ranch-style home 20 miles north of Baton Rouge. But after confronting the horror, the deputy reported back and East Feliciana Parish Coroner Dr Ewell Dewitt Bickham III immediately came out. He said: 'The scene was sickening. I've seen some horrible things in my life but nothing like this.' He said bedsores went all the way down to her bone. Horrific photos issued by Dr Bickham's office revealed the feces smeared hole in the sofa where Bickham believes Lacey might have been sitting for the past 12 years. The Fletchers were meant to be her caregivers. 'It's unconscionable, something you make horror movies about,' said Bickham. The moment he arrived at the home he was hit by a stench so bad 'it would almost make you run out of the house.' He said he knew immediately it was a potential crime scene. 'The parents were in the kitchen. They did not have an explanation,' he said. 'I couldn't eat for a week and I cried for a week.' He ruled her death a homicide with the cause as medical neglect - believing she passed 24 to 48 hours before his official time of death of 3.07am, January 3. The tragedy is even more of a mystery as Sheila Fletcher worked for authorities who might have helped her daughter. She was a police and court clerk in the small nearby city of Baker and more recently an assistant to the city prosecutor in Zachary, a slighter larger community also nearby. The mom was also on Slaughter's Board of Alderman but quit on January 24 following four years' service and three weeks after the horror discovery. Clay Fletcher is an officer of non-profit Baton Rouge Civil War Roundtable, which has a mission 'to educate and foster an appreciation for the sacrifices made by all during the Civil War'. The couple's lawyer Steven Moore has said in a statement: 'They don't want to relive the pain of losing a child through the media. 'They have been through a lot of heartache over the years. Anyone who had lost a child knows what it's like.' Before the grand jury hearing, the coroner said he would present the case with the hope of the parents being charged over the death. 'I probably won't even have to open my mouth, the pictures will show it,' he said. District Attorney D'Aquilla has said: 'On a murder, you have to have intent. Did they want to kill her? I want to say yeah, they wanted to kill her.' 'Negligent homicide is zero to five years, manslaughter is zero to 40 years and second-degree is life in prison. I will ask for second degree because they didn't do what they were supposed to do. 'We don't treat animals or neglect animals in that way. If you have an animal in that condition you have to take them to a vet. 'If you are not capable of providing the care then get help. We want people to know that if you are a caregiver of someone you need to pay attention. It is important for neighbors and the community to look out for each other. We hope this never happens again.' He said the Fletchers claimed in 2011-2012 that Lacey didn't want to leave the house and had not been to a doctor. He said the parents claimed she was able to communicate with them and apparently never complained. D'Aquilla added it was not known when Lacey had last moved from the couch. The Fletchers reportedly said Lacey developed 'some degree of Asperger's syndrome' after 9th grade when she started being home schooled. They insisted during an interview with law enforcement that she was the one who chose never to leave the couch and to relieve herself there or on a nearby towel, it is reported. Sheila Fletcher said she routinely cleaned her daughter's sores. 'Mom and Dad love you so much,' she wrote in a Facebook post after the death. News of the January horror is breaking now as the autopsy report was not handed to East Feliciana Sheriff's Office until March. At that point Sheriff Travis consulted with District Attorney D'Aquilla on a course of action that has resulted in this grand jury deliberation. A new East Feliciana Parish grand jury is selected every six months, with a new one chosen today. Authorities decided it should be the new jury that decided the Fletcher case.",
  "31cb8bd84dc3e628142c651122432e8969acba84bcd958a223c7c7d4": "The grandparents of an Australian family are being deported after arriving in the country unvaccinated against Covid and without a travel exemption. After a 19 hour flight from Ireland, Anne and Audie Ryan-Murphy touched down in Perth and were immediately met by Border Force officials. The pair were questioned for 10 hours after their flight on Monday and have since been detained at the Hyatt Hotel in Perth's CBD awaiting deportation. While travellers no longer need to take a Covid test to fly Down Under, they do need to be vaccinated or have an exemption.  Mr and Ms Ryan-Murphy made the long journey after strict travel restrictions separated them from their family for three years.  The grandparents were set to meet their granddaughter for the first time and believed they had the right approvals for the long-awaited reunion.    'They were honest about their vaccination status from the very beginning,' their son Karl said.  'Under the guidance of a travel agent at home they did everything they were asked to do: weeks worth of paperwork and waiting on approvals.' He explained the couple were expecting to enter hotel quarantine because of their vaccination status.  Unvaccinated Australians returning home are required in some states, including Western Australia, to enter hotel quarantine for seven days - but the same is not allowed for tourists, who must instead have a special exemption. The Irish couple timed their arrival to help their son and his heavily pregnant wife who are preparing to welcome the arrival of their second child. 'We are expecting our 2nd baby to be born any day now with an induction booked for 4th of May, if she doesn't arrive before,' Karl said.     'I know that many of us have been in this terrible situation since Covid, but knowing they are just down the road and we can't be reunited is beyond heart-breaking.  'They had planned on being here for two months to help us find our feet, with very little support here in Perth.' Recent rule changes have seen the end of Covid restrictions and mandates across the country but unvaccinated overseas travellers still have to get an exemption before entering the country. Western Australia has recently dropped a number of its strict Covid requirements and after a two year hiatus opened its borders to arrivals last month.  Ms Ryan-Murphy said her and her husband believed they had done their due-diligence in the months leading up to their arrival. 'We were devastated. Everyone thinks we're criminals,' Ms Ryan-Murphy told Nine News.   'Have we slipped through a net here? Why were we allowed on (the plane)? 'We told on all the forms that we were unvaxed.' Border Force officials allegedly told the couple that they should have never been allowed on the flight.  Mr and Ms Ryan-Murphy are being held at the Hyatt Hotel and are booked to be deported on a flight on Tuesday night.  Their family are pleading with the government to grant them an exemption on compassionate grounds.  International travellers to Australia (including Australians overseas) must declare their COVID-19 vaccination status to enter Australia and must be able to provide appropriate supporting evidence. Travellers may need to present this at check-in for their travel to Australia. If you are vaccinated, you must present your COVID-19 vaccination certificate to the airline or vessel staff when checking-in for your travel and may also be requested to present it to border officials upon arrival in Australia. Travellers vaccinated in other countries should present certificates in formats that meet the following criteria: Paper and digital certificates are equally acceptable.

  "c802b7673d1e534495203c69882fdad9f3f6beebca175f17dc9adee3": "Elon Musk has stepped out for the first time since sealing his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter last week, accompanying his mother Maye on the red carpet at the Met Gala.  Musk, 50, was asked by La La Anthony, interviewing guests as they arrive, about his plans for Twitter. 'My goal, assuming everything gets done, is to make Twitter as inclusive as possible and to have as broad a swathe of people on Twitter as possible,' he said. 'And that it is entertaining and funny and they have as much fun as possible.' He was also asked about his outfit for the event, which was staged with the theme Gilded Glamor. 'Just following the dress code,' he replied. His mother, 74, was wearing a crimson velvet Dior dress, with Chopard jewelry.  When Vogue tweeted the news of his arrival, the new Twitter owner replied: 'How do you do?'  Maye Musk has been a working model since she was 15 in South Africa and continues to be in demand.  In 2010, she posed nude on the cover of a health issue of Time magazine, and in 2011 she posed as an aging pregnant woman on the cover of New York. Both she and her son have attended the gala several times before. In 2016, Maye and Elon attended, with the theme 'Manus x Machina'. Asked to describe her son, Maye said: 'From the moment he could speak, he could discuss.' In 2018, he used the event to make his relationship with singer Grimes 'red carpet official', wearing a white tuxedo jacket, with white script on the back which read 'novus ordo seclorum,' meaning 'new world order'. Last year, Musk hosted an exclusive after-party at the fashionable private club Zero Bond, where guests included Lil Nas X, Leonardo DiCaprio, Chris Rock, Rami Malek, music mogul Scooter Braun, Nina Agdal, and rapper Lil Baby.  In 2021 the event was staged in September, rather than on its traditional May date, due to the pandemic.  Musk was asked on Monday night what he made of the soiree, and how it felt to be there. 'I feel great actually,' he told Anthony. 'It's exciting to see all these looks. 'And what we have here is the most talented people in style and fashion - and it's the pinnacle of their work. 'I'm honored to be here, and it's lovely.' Hours before the gala began, it emerged that Musk is in talks with large investment firms and high net-worth individuals about taking on more financing for his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter and tying up less of his wealth in the deal, Reuters reported. Musk is the world's richest person, with Forbes estimating his net worth at about $245 billion.  Yet most of his wealth is tied up in the shares of Tesla, the electric car maker he leads.  Last week, Musk disclosed he sold $8.5 billion worth of Tesla stock following his agreement to buy Twitter. The new financing, which could come in the form of preferred or common equity, could reduce the $21 billion cash contribution that Musk has committed to the deal as well as a margin loan he secured against his Tesla shares, the sources said. The banks that agreed last month to provide $13 billion in loans based on Twitter's business balked at offering more debt for Musk's acquisition given the San Francisco-based company's limited cash flow, Reuters reported last month. Musk has also pledged some of his Tesla shares to banks to arrange a $12.5 billion margin loan to help fund the deal.  Investors have been fretting over whether Musk will complete the Twitter deal given that he has backtracked in the past.  In April, he decided at the last minute not to take up a seat on Twitter's board.  In 2018, Musk tweeted that there was 'funding secured' for a $72 billion deal to take Tesla private but did not move ahead with an offer. Twitter shares ended trading up 0.2% at $49.14 in New York on Monday, closer to the $54.20 per share acquisition price, as investors interpreted the news on the new financing discussions as making it slightly more likely that the deal will close. Musk would have to pay a $1 billion termination fee to Twitter if he walked away, and the social media company could also sue him to complete the deal. Musk, who calls himself a free speech absolutist, has criticized Twitter's moderation policies.  He wants Twitter's algorithm for prioritizing tweets to be public and objects to giving too much power on the service to corporations that advertise.",
  "1b94381499a37d16240d01e4985d46a9dfe714c493fae463e1a7012f": "New Zealand has welcomed back tourists from more than 50 visa-waiver countries after two years of Covid border restrictions, but arrivals will still have to meet entry requirements relating to the virus. Australians were granted entry three weeks ago - with more than 4,000 on board 11 flights upon resumption of trans-Tasman travel, and as of Monday travellers from dozens more countries were allowed to visit. Vaccinated tourists and permanent residents can enter New Zealand provided they have a negative pre-departure test. They must either present evidence of a negative PCR COVID-19 test taken no more than 48 hours before departing for New Zealand, or a supervised Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) within 24 hours of boarding their flight.  Upon arrival, travellers must self-test again, and provided the result is again negative they do not need to quarantine.  Since 2020, the arrival terminals at New Zealand's international airports have been desolate as the country swiftly imposed some of the world's strictest Covid border controls.  However, on Monday Auckland's international airport was filled with tears, hugs, and waiata (Maori song) as the first foreign guests, aside from Aussies, were welcomed into the country since the beginning of the pandemic.  Fully-vaccinated travellers from a long list of countries around the globe, including Japan, U.S, UK, Canada and most of Europe are now free to enter the country without having to quarantine in a hotel.  Air New Zealand has since added an extra 96 trans-Tasman flights across May and June; an increase of approximately 20,000 seats with ski season looming. The country has long been renowned for its breathtaking scenery and adventure tourism offerings such as bungy jumping and skiing.  Before the spread of COVID-19, more than 3 million tourists visited each year, accounting for 20% of New Zealand's foreign income and more than 5% of the overall economy. However, international tourism stopped altogether in early 2020 after New Zealand first pursued an elimination strategy and then tried to tightly control the spread of the virus.  The spread of omicron and vaccinations of more than 80% of New Zealand's 5 million population prompted the gradual easing of restrictions. 'Today is a day to celebrate, and is a big moment in our reconnection with the world,' said Tourism Minister Stuart Nash. At Auckland Airport, flights bringing in tourists began landing from early in the morning, coming in direct from places including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Kuala Lumpur, and Singapore. The border reopening will help boost tourism ahead of New Zealand's upcoming ski season. But the real test of how much the tourism industry rebounds will come in December, when the peak summer season begins in the Southern Hemisphere nation. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said more than 90,000 people had booked flights to New Zealand in the seven weeks since the reopening was announced and 21 international flights were scheduled to land Monday in Auckland. 'Our tourism industry have felt the effects of the global pandemic acutely, and are working hard to prepare,' she said. Ardern said there were no immediate plans to ease virus testing and vaccination requirements for tourists. Most tourists from India, China and other non-waiver countries are still not allowed to enter. ",
  "8da2984c544f99a592f58cb18b0c88148d81dc115030aaad5f698bf2": "Australians borrowers face big increases in their monthly mortgage bills, after the Reserve Bank raised the cash rate by a quarter of a percentage point and hinted at more. The RBA's first rate increase since November 2010 ends the era of a record-low 0.1 per cent that began in November 2020. Governor Philip Lowe has hinted at 'further increases in interest rates' in coming months following the first election campaign rate rise since 2007. Three of Australia's Big Four banks are expecting a two per cent cash rate by 2023 - which would mean seven more rate rises within a year. That would be on top of this latest 0.25 percentage point rise which took the cash rate to 0.35 per cent - the highest since March 2020 at the start of the pandemic. This was much higher than the 0.15 percentage point increase financial markets were expecting.  Inflation in the year to March surged by 5.1 per cent, the fastest pace since mid-2001 a year after the 10 per cent GST was introduced. With inflation well above the RBA's two to three per cent target, Dr Lowe gave a strong indication there would be more rate rises in 2022 and 2023 as Russia's Ukraine invasion threatens to keep petrol prices elevated. 'We expect further increases in interest rates will be necessary in the months ahead,' he said. 'If interest rates were to remain unchanged, inflation would be substantially higher.' More than 1.5million borrowers will be coping with a variable mortgage rate increase for the first time.  A borrower with a typical $600,000 loan - on a low 2.29 per cent variable rate - would see their monthly repayments rise by $78 from $2,306 to $2,384 should their bank pass on the RBA increase in full, taking their variable rate to 2.54 per cent.   Three of Australia's Big Four banks - ANZ, Westpac and NAB - also expect the Reserve Bank to take the cash rate to two per cent by 2023 as rates increase seven more times, with more pain possibly coming in June. Westpac and its subsidiary St George were the first bank to hint at an increase in variable mortgage rates.  CommSec chief economist Craig James said savers would benefit as borrowers were punished. 'While bad news for borrowers, an increase in interest rates represents good news for the nation's depositors,' he said. 'And certainly more Australians have been squirreling away cash over the past few years.' $500,000 : Monthly repayments rising by $65 from $1,922 to $1,987 $600,000 : Monthly repayments rising by $78 from $2,306 to $2,384 $700,000 : Monthly repayments rising by $90 from $2,691 to $2,781 $800,000 : Monthly repayments rising by $103 from $3,075 to $3,178 $900,000 : Monthly repayments rising by $116 from $3,459 to $3,575 $1,000,000 : Monthly repayments rising by $130 from $3,843 to $3,973 Data based on variable rate increasing from 2.29 per cent to 2.54 per cent   Last month, the RBA predicted an increase in the cash rate to two per cent - a level unseen since May 2016, would cause a 15 per cent plunge in Australian property prices.  CoreLogic research director Tim Lawless is expecting Sydney and Melbourne house prices to dive by 15 per cent in the year ahead, as interest rates keep rising. 'Most of the declines will be concentrated in those two cities because that's where affordability is most stretched and also where, arguably, they'll be facing some demographic headwinds just through interstate migration really favouring the smaller states,' he told Daily Mail Australia.  'The counter argument to that is we see overseas borders opening up, we're going to be seeing more migration coming in but that generally tends to flow through to rental demand rather than purchasing demand.'  Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart and Canberra, along with regional areas in coastal New South Wales, southern Queensland and northern Tasmania were likely to see smaller declines of five to 10 per cent. 'These markets tend to be a little bit more insulated partly because affordability is not quite as stretched,' Mr Lawless said. Those markets are more affordable than Sydney and Melbourne and would continue to benefit from professionals who can work from home moving there. A 15 per cent fall in Sydney's median house price of $1.417million would take values back to $1.204million - where they were in the middle of last year. A drop of the same magnitude in Melbourne would see the mid-point house price drop from $1.001million to $850,787, which would be the lowest level since May 2017. But with unemployment at just 3.95 per cent, the lowest level since 1974, Mr Lawless said forced sales would be unlikely. 'This will probably more a lack of demand and people looking to sell having to adjust their price expectations,' Mr Lawless said. $500,000: Monthly repayments rising by $521 from $1,922 to $2,443 $600,000: Monthly repayments rising by $625 from $2,306 to $2,931 $700,000: Monthly repayments rising by $729 from $2,691 to $3,420 $800,000: Monthly repayments rising by $833 from $3,075 to $3,908 $900,000: Monthly repayments rising by $937 from $3,459 to $4,396 $1,000,000: Monthly repayments rising by $1,042 from $3,843 to $4,885 Data based on variable rate rising from 2.29 per cent to 4.19 per cent before the Reserve Bank of Australia raised the cash rate  ",
  "68f3727acd728fec34fe602b1802aa7d075dd38c1d0045a140d29c62": "While homeowners will grit their teeth as the Reserve Bank raises interest rates for the first time in 11 years, there are some winners from the increase in the cash rate. People making an effort to save money - including for a first home - as well as those planning to travel overseas, online retailers and the banks are all obvious beneficiaries of an interest rate rise.   The central bank surprised financial markets with a bigger than expected increase on Tuesday in an effort to curb soaring inflation. The cash rate has risen by 0.25 percentage points, ending the historic era of a record-low 0.1 per cent cash rate and marking the first increase since November 2010. The official rate now stands at 0.35 per cent - the highest since March 2020 at the start of the pandemic - after inflation in the year to March soared by 5.1 per cent or the fastest pace in 21 years. More than 1.5million borrowers will be coping with a variable increase for the first time as monthly repayments on a typical $600,000 mortgage rise by $78.  But for those households who don't own a home but are saving cash in term deposits, perhaps for a deposit to put down on a first home, the rise is good news as their money earns higher interest.  But if the rate of inflation outstrips the interest a savings account earns, the likely benefit will be lost. In addition, banks may not choose to pass on the full rate increase to savers. The possible effect of this rise and future rate rises on dampening the soaring value of property in Australia is also potentially good news for aspiring home-owners.  A higher interest rate will also boost the Australian dollar as foreign investors buy more of our currency to try and buy local assets. Rate rises also make Australia a more attractive place to put savings.  This is positive news for those travelling overseas, or who like buying overseas goods via online sites, as their money has greater purchasing power of foreign currency. The take-out - your post-Covid overseas holiday will now be slightly cheaper than it was before the rate rise. A higher cash rate also means imports into Australia become cheaper, but our exports become more expensive.  Banks are the obvious other winners of the latest rise.  If interest rates are conceived of as 'the price of money', banks and other lenders receiving a larger percentage of a home loan as interest is good for the financial institution's bottom line.  A final group of winners are stock market bargain-hunters. Interest rate rises have a dampening effect on the overall value of the share market, meaning those with spare cash to invest can pick up cheaper stocks and hold onto them for a time when the market bounces back. The rate increase was bigger than the 0.15 percentage point rise financial markets were expecting, threatening the re-election hopes of Prime Minister Scott Morrison ahead of the May 21 poll.  The central bank move is also the first during an election campaign since November 2007, when former Liberal prime minister John Howard lost power. Governor Philip Lowe said:  'The economy has proven to be resilient and inflation has picked up more quickly, and to a higher level, than was expected.' SAVERS: Those people with cash in term deposits earn a higher rate of interest on their savings. That's positive for those saving for a house deposit and is double beneficial if the interest rate rise dampens property values in Australia. TRAVELLERS: An interest rate rise generally boosts the Australian dollar as foreign investors seek more of our more valuable currency. As a result our dollar buys more foreign currency than it did before the rate rise, reducing the expense of your overseas holiday.  BANKS: Higher interest rates mean banks take a higher percentage of a home loan in interest - boosting their profit margins. Three of Australia's Big Four banks - ANZ, Westpac and NAB - are expecting the Reserve Bank to take the cash rate to two per cent by 2023 as rates increase seven more times, with more pain possibly coming in June. Dr Lowe is also expecting the era of low wages growth that began in mid-2013 to be over this year, after last year declaring weak pay increases could help the RBA to keep rates on hold until 2024 'at the earliest'. 'There is also evidence that wages growth is picking up,' he said. 'Given this, and the very low level of interest rates, it is appropriate to start the process of normalising monetary conditions.' More than 1.5million borrowers will be coping with a variable increase for the first time as monthly repayments on a typical $600,000 mortgage rise by $78. St George, owned by Westpac, was the first bank to hint at an increase in variable mortgage rates. 'We are currently reviewing our variable interest rates following the RBA's cash rate decision,' it said. 'We will keep you up to date with any changes here.' Last month, the RBA predicted an increase in the cash rate to two per cent - a level unseen since May 2016, would cause a 15 per cent plunge in Australian property prices.

A 0.25 percentage point increase will see monthly repayments on a typical $600,000 mortgage to climb by $78, from $2,306 to $2,384.

  "9c37458b5ea387f27e529a1d0471cbab65c02ac76f2ad301fe95d77c": "A career criminal, accused of shooting a tourist in Manhattan in order to rob him of his pricey $450,000 Richard Mille watch has appeared in court on charges of attempted murder. Nathaniel Owens, 35, who was already on parole for weapons charges from 2012 is the prime suspect in an attack on tourist Pierrick Jamaux, 33, that occurred outside a hotel in Midtown in March. Prosecutors say Jamaux, who was visiting the city from Hong King with his Australian model wife, Sarah Watts, 26, was attacked by Owens who shot him five times in the groin and legs in order to get at his watch. Jamaux, a cryptocurrency expert, would often show off the flashy timepiece on social media. At the time of the assault he said that he had 'absolutely no clue who did this' and that it was 'to steal my watch.'  Owens has a lengthy rap sheet having been arrested 18 times since 2012. It includes charges for drug possession, assault and criminal possession of a weapon. Owens has two prior illegal gun convictions from a Brooklyn incident 2005 and 2012 in Queens. He had also been in state prison for second-degree criminal possession of a weapon but was paroled in March 2018. According to Assistant District Attorney Diana Serebrenik after Jamaux's shooting surveillance video shows Owens changed his clothes before and afterwards. He faces a minimum of 20 years to life in jail if convicted.  Speaking from his hospital bed in New York in March, entrepreneur Jamaux told DailyMail.com: 'Given the fact he was waiting there when we arrived and also the violence of the crime, I believe he followed me.  'Someone knew I had the watch and somebody knew I'd be back in the hotel at that time,' he said.  'I believe they found me somewhere, then they tracked me for a few hours or days to figure out what I do, where I go. I think it was organized.' He added: 'It cannot be a coincidence because it happened between the Uber and the door of the hotel - there is two meters of distance. The guy was waiting for me there is no doubt about it.  'He started shooting me even before I understood he wanted my watch and from then I was just pushing the gun down and he kept shooting my legs, it was crazy. 'I know he shot five times but I think some of them went through both legs. Three of them are point-blank shooting. I have a lot of bullet holes.' A 25-year-old female friend of the couple jumped on the robber's back and began to choke him. 'She is one of my really good friends, she is fiery,' Jamaux joked, adding that she'd had a few drinks. 'She jumped on his back and she did a triangle-like choke like in MMA.'   The bullets shattered his femur bone and severed his femoral artery, and he quickly passed out in the street as he began to bleed out.   The suspect was unable to wrangle the pricey watch from Jamaux's wrist because its bracelet security mechanism.  The attempted robber got away with a female accomplice in a black four door sedan BMW.  Miraculously, Jamaux survived the shooting,  and credits New York hospitals' experience with tackling shootings for his recovery.  'They hit my femoral artery - it's something where you usually die in 5 minutes - it was a major surgery to save my life,' he said. 'If you are going to get shot, the US is the best place to survive a gunshot wound. 'I feel like the doctors really know what they are doing. I think they unfortunately have a lot of practice. 'I was surprised when I talked to one of the doctors here. I said 'does it happen often?' and he was like 'yes' without hesitation.' Jamaux lived in New York for a year about a decade ago and said the city felt safe at the time. Often on his business trips, he hires a bodyguard, but didn't know he would need one in the Big Apple. 'Because I thought New York was safe, I did not think I needed any security in New York,' he explained. 'A few days before the shooting we walked for one block around midnight and I did not feel safe at all. 'If I knew New York had changed like that, I would never have come here. I probably would have diverted my business trip and stayed in Europe.  'You don't need to be a genius to realize New York is very very dangerous right now. I don't think it's safe for anyone. There are too many people who have nothing to lose.'   Jamaux works in Hong Kong for Hi, an online banking planform dealing in cryptocurrency, savings and investments.  The entrepreneur has also worked in Paris, where he hails from, New York City and London before he settled in Hong Kong to work with the cryptocurrency company in 2019.   Jamaux was sporting a Richard Mille watch when the attack took place. The watches cost on average, $200,000, with some designs fetching for as much as $1.3 million.  The attempted robbery comes amid a dangerous crime wave in the once-safe city.  The arrests comes as New York is in the middle of a crime surge, with overall crime up 42 percent.  The Big Apple is having an increasing problem with ghost guns and other weapons, with shooting victims up 4.4 percent. Assaults and robbery are also both up 20 and 45 percent, respectively.  Last week, Mayor Eric Adams said that New Yorkers can look forward to a 'visible difference in policing in the next couple of weeks.'",
  "ccadd7c27dbe798baac5da2cad31962a1ca260c81ea3f8f0b7eb699f": "Blac Chyna on Monday vowed to appeal the verdict in her defamation trial, which saw her lose a $108 million case against the Kardashians. The 33 year-old had accused Kim Kardashian, her sisters Khloe and Kylie Jenner and their mother, Kris Jenner, of making statements that ruined or defamed her reputation and of plotting to get her TV show 'Rob and Chyna' axed. On Friday, Kim was dropped from the defamation part of the suit. But on Monday, the jury returned a verdict that, while it did not completely exonerate the billionaire clan of any wrongdoing, still awarded Chyna no damages at all. The Los Angeles jury found that none of the members defamed Chyna, nor did any interfere with her contract by convincing the E! network to cancel her reality show 'Rob & Chyna.' After about 10 hours of deliberations, the jurors decided on the long jury form that the Kardashians often acted in bad faith, finding that they were not justified in telling the executives and producers of 'Rob & Chyna' that Chyna abused their son and brother Rob Kardashian.  But they found that it had no substantial effect on Chyna's contract or the fate of the show, and she was awarded no damages. Executives from the E! network, which aired the show, testified that 'Rob & Chyna' ended because the relationship ended, not because of the defendants' actions. 'They're very pleased,' Rhodes said. 'I hope they enjoy their gala in New York.' Chyna's attorney Lynne Ciani said that based on her reading of the verdict, 'the jury found that Chyna had not physically abused Rob Kardashian,' and 'the jury found that all four defendants had intentionally interfered with her contract with the E! Network.' 'We will appeal on the remaining questions,' she added. Chyna sat in stunned silence as the court clerk announced their decision. Her mother has now launched a GoFundMe to try and pay for her daughter's appeal. She is seeking $400,000. The Kardashians, meanwhile, were 'exuberant' at the news, their lawyer Michael Rhodes said. They were not in court, because they were attending the Met Gala in New York City. 'I'm just happy it's over,' Kris Jenner told Variety.  She said the toughest part was 'going through it'. Asked how she coped, she replied: 'Pray. I live in my faith and just hope that's enough, and yeah, I'm glad it's over. I'm glad it's over for the girls. We're here to celebrate.'  In LA, meanwhile, Rhodes told reporters: 'I think the case was very clear cut. The jury got it. I appreciate their service. 'I think the judge did a wonderful job of making sure it was a fair trial. 'They [the Kardashian-Jenners] were very pleased, very grateful.  'They were emphatic in their explicit expression of pleasure.  'I got to know them quite well over the last few years, and as you know, they're exuberant.' Asked if he thought the case would be a shoo-in for the Kardashians, he told DailyMail.com: 'With a jury, there is no such thing as a slam dunk if you've been doing this for a living as long as I have.' In a statement he added, 'On behalf of Kris, Kim, Kylie and Khloe, I want to express our appreciation to the jury. 'We are also grateful for the steady hand of Judge Alarcon in making sure that this was a fair trial. 'The jury sent a clear message to Miss White (Chyna) and her lawyer - I hope they are listening. Justice has prevailed.' Defense attorney Michelle Carrie Doolin added that 'Mr [Rob] Kardashian is very grateful to the jury service and happy to have this matter behind him.  'And he looks forward to moving on to a new chapter and raising his beautiful daughter.' The jury was twice sent back to deliberate further when it was found that on some questions in the case against Kylie Jenner the vote had been 8-4 when at least 9-3 was required in the civil case, but they quickly returned with 9-3 votes and the result remained unchanged. Jurors were considering the defamation case against Kris Jenner, Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner, after a judge threw out the part of the lawsuit against Kim Kardashian in the middle of deliberations. All four of the women testified during the nine-day trial. The trial focused largely on allegations that Chyna violently attacked her then-fiance and reality TV co-star Rob Kardashian on a night and morning in December 2016.  He testified that she twice held a gun to his head, wrapped a phone-charging cord around his neck and beat him with a metal rod.  Chyna testified that she had put the cord around his neck and held the gun playfully as the two celebrated the renewal of their reality show, and when the celebration turned into a dispute, she was never violent against him. But the legal questions the jury considered were all about the aftermath of that fight. Jurors had to decide whether each of the defendants knowingly lied about the abuse when they talked about it with the producers and executives overseeing 'Rob & Chyna,' or spread word about it with reckless disregard for the truth.  And they had to decide for each defendant whether those communications were an illegal interference with Chyna's contract to appear on the show. In her closing argument, Ciani argued that it was unreasonable for the four women to have believed that her client violently attacked her former fiance Rob Kardashian. 'He didn't have a mark on him,' Ciani told jurors. 'There was no call to the police, no trip to the hospital, not even a Band-Aid.' Rhodes argued during his closing that the women had every reason to believe the accounts of the attack from Rob Kardashian and from Kris Jenner's longtime boyfriend Corey Gamble, who arrived at the scene and broke up the dispute. 'Do you remember how Rob looked on the stand? His pain was real,' Rhodes said. 'This is a real family. Yeah, they're famous, but they're real people. He got really badly hurt here.' It appeared during the trial that Gamble would prove to be the key witness for the defense. But the television executives and producers whose testimony was often technical, and utterly without drama, would prove more important in the jury's findings, which rendered the women's stories of abuse largely irrelevant. The case went to the jury at 4.30pm last Thursday and the 12 men and women on the panel took till 3.30pm on Monday to reach their verdict. Under California law, civil trials require at least 9 jurors to vote in favor of a verdict. Unlike the the rest of the trial, there was no fashion parade of Kardashians at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse in downtown LA. Kim, 41, Khloe, 37, Kylie, 24 and Kris, 66, were all 3,000 miles away at the glittering Metropolitan Gala in New York City.  Only their attorney, Rhodes, was in court to represent them. Chyna's lawyer, Lynne Ciani, said after the verdict, 'The jury found that Chyna had not physically abused Rob Kardashian and that they interfered with her contract. 'We will appeal the remaining questions.' The Los Angeles trial lasted almost two weeks before lawyers for both sides wound up their closing arguments and the case went to the jury at 4:30pm on Thursday. Under California law, civil trials require at least nine jurors to vote in favor of a verdict. If nine or more can't agree, the judge can declare a mistrial. That would essentially mean that neither side won - and a new trial, with a new jury, could be convened, in which the case would be tried all over again. After about 10 hours of deliberations, the jurors found on the long jury form that the Kardashians often acted in bad faith on the issues brought up in the case, but that it had no substantial effect on Chyna's contract or the fate of the show. As a result, she was awarded no damages.  On the 13-page special verdict form, the most significant of the 70 questions the jury had to answer was number 69: 'What are Angela White's damages?' Angela White is the real name of Blac Chyna.  The jurors left the answer blank. The jury did find, however, that all four Kardashian defendants' actions with respect to Chyna's 'Rob and Chyna' contract with E! were 'not justified.' And they found that only Kylie Jenner's 'conduct prevented performance (of Chyna) or make performance more expensive or better.'  The jury did not find the same for the other three family members. Kylie was also singled out as the only one the jury felt 'intended to disrupt the performance' of Chyna's contract with E! The jurors decided that Kylie's statement - 'She (Chyna) will proceed with using and physically abusing my brother' - was not true. But they answered 'no' when asked: 'Was Kylie Jenner's conduct a substantial factor in causing harm to Angela White?' They also found that Kris Jenner's claim that 'she (Chyna) beat the s*** out of Rob's face,' was not true. But her other statement - that 'she beat the s*** out of him' - was true. Rhodes, representing the Kardashians, urged the jury in his summing up on Friday 'to let the family start to heal.' He said there was no substance to Chyna's suit, seeking damages for economic loss of $108 million, saying she had failed to present any hard financial evidence of loss of income or of emotional distress. Rhodes said that Chyna was violent and aggressive. 'Did Chyna beat the s*** out of Rob? Yes, she did,' he said. 'It was true. It happened.' Rhodes referred to the day of Chyna and her 35-year-old boyfriend's 'big fight' in December 2016, when she packed up and left their home with their baby girl, Dream, born a month earlier. Rob Kardashian said that she hit him with a six-foot rod, pulled a phone cord around his neck and twice pointed a gun at his head. During her testimony, Chyna, 33, denied that they broke up at that point. Chyna maintains their relationship ended in the summer of 2017, but the defendants say Chyna acknowledged in a written declaration that the two split in December 2016. Rhodes told jurors on Thursday that she denied the relationship had ended because she wanted to show the television program was still viable. 'She had to confirm the relationship was still ok because she has to convince you that the network still wanted her show,' Rhodes said. 'This was not a relationship that any network executive wants on TV.' 'Rob and Chyna' premiered in September 2016 and ran for one season. The series was renewed for a second season, but in light of Kardashian and Chyna's breakup, plans for Season 2 were put on hold. Chyna alleges the Kardashians spread false reports of her assaulting him in order to have the 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' spinoff canceled and ruin her reality TV career.  E! network executives testified during the trial that 'Rob & Chyna' was supposed to be a light-hearted romantic comedy. The court was also told that a producer on the show told Chyna that if she wanted a second season of the show, she would have to mend her relationship with Kardashian, and suggested counseling could help. Rhodes on Thursday said Chyna's reaction to the idea was: 'F*** no, f*** that. 'F*** Rob. I'm not doing that.' Rhodes asked the jury: 'Is this the relationship you want to build your romantic comedy around? 'Somebody who would say that to her baby's father? Would you put this on the air?' Asking the jury to 'walk with me' over to his clients - Rhodes represents Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner, who are all defendants - he pointed at the assembled Kardashians and said: 'This is the child's grandmother, her aunts.' Rhodes told the jury to recall the 'pain and anguish' on Rob Kardashian's face during his testimony on Wednesday, noting: 'That was real. This is a real family. 'Yes they're famous, but they're real people. 'Just because Rob is a big guy, doesn't mean he can't be a victim. 'How would you feel if you child went through this? 'Picture Rob. What did he look like? Was that fake?' Rhodes also accused Chyna of 'hiding her money' and not filing tax returns for three years. Under oath, Chyna admitted that she told her accountant to stop preparing her tax returns for the year 2019 and has not paid taxes since. 'You cheated the government - but we're going to give you millions of dollars - is that right?' he asked the jury. 'That's concealment.' She was accused during the fight of smashing a TV, a bedroom door and a Christmas gingerbread house. 'The gingerbread house was silly, over the top and beautiful - like the Kardashians,' said Rhodes. 'When she smashed it, she was venting her anger on everything she was not going to be.' Earlier on Thursday, the judge denied Chyna's request to repeat her testimony against the Kardashians after she became upset and walked off the stand when she was shown a nude photo of herself during cross-examination.  December 14, 2016 -  Chyna says she and her then-fiance were 'laughing and joking and being silly' as they celebrated season two of Rob and Chyna being greenlit by NBC  Universal.  She denies yelling 'I'm going to kill you' to Rob. She told the court that she pointed the gun upwards and didn't put her finger where the trigger was.   Chyna says she put a phone chord around Rob's neck 'as a joke', because 'he was playing video games and I was just trying to get his attention.'  December 15, 2016 - Chyna smashes a TV and a gingerbread house and damages the bedroom door. She said she was furious at Rob for taking her phone in a fit of jealousy and locking himself in a closet to check her messages.  Kris Jenner's boyfriend, Corey Gamble, shows up at Rob and Chyna's home. Chyna says that he stood between her and Rob, telling Rob to get his car keys and get out of the house.  Chyna leaves the home with daughter Dream that morning. January 2017 - Chyna says she and Rob hiked together in Malibu. Rob reportedly goes with her to New York for her personal appearance at a strip club, where cameras followed her.  Chyna said she was also filmed by hand-held cameras at another Las Vegas appearance, which made her think they were shooting Rob and Chyna's season two.  July/August 2017 - Chyna learns Rob and Chyna had actually been cancelled. October 2017 -  Chyna files a $108 million defamation suit against Kris Jenner and Kylie, Khloe and Kim Kardashian and accuses them of forcing producers to cancel her show.  April 19, 2022 - The case finally goes to trial. May 2, 2022 - Chyna loses the case, and is awarded nothing in damages.  Judge Gregory W. Alarcon made the decision on Thursday afternoon to move on to closing arguments. Chyna's attorney Lynne Ciani rested the plaintiff's case on Thursday morning.  The photo is central to another trial that will begin soon after this one concludes.  Chyna is suing Rob Kardashian over the image, alleging he posted it online out of retribution. Kris Jenner, Kylie Jenner and Khloe Kardashian were in the front row of the courtroom early on Thursday.  Kim Kardashian was absent after attending most of the nine-day trial. Alarcon began reading the jury instructions in the case late Thursday morning. Ciani wrapped up her case Thursday by showing jurors a video deposition from Frances Berwick, an executive with NBCUniversal, E!'s parent company. Berwick said that a second season of 'Rob & Chyna' didn't go ahead because 'their relationship broke down.' Berwick said: 'Their relationship was in a sad place and we didn't think that it was a good fit for E! - which is frothy and escapist, on the lighter side.' Berwick said she had not had a conversation with Kris Jenner in which Kris threatened to pull 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians' if season two of 'Rob & Chyna' went ahead. Asked why NBCUniversal issued a press release in December 2016 announcing a new season, she said that didn't mean the series had been 'greenlit' but that it was only 'an indication of what we hoped to do.' She added that 'it would not be the first time' a press release had come out announcing a show that did not go forward later.   Chyna appeared in court Thursday wearing a black check jacket, black leggings and black spike heels, with an orange jacket over the top. Khloe Kardashian was also in attendance and arrived wearing a black tuxedo jacket over a silk shirt, black leggings and white sneakers.  Her mother, Kris Jenner wore black pants and a black blazer with white piping. During cross examination last week Rhodes presented Chyna with a copy of the restraining order she filed in 2017 against her ex-fiance, Rob Kardashian after he allegedly posted 'revenge porn' photos of her on social media. Attached to the restraining order documents were copies of the offending nude pictures which both parties in the case had previously agreed by stipulation would not be shown to the jury. Jurors did not see them, but Chyna did, and allegedly became 'upset' and rattled by the photos. Chyna was so distressed that when Rhodes grilled her later about the amount of damages she is seeking, she couldn't name a dollar figure and only gave vague answers to other questions he asked about damages, her lawyer claimed. Seeing the pictures 'derailed' Chyna's testimony, Ciani told Judge Alarcon. 'There was a stipulation that the photos would not be included which was violated intentionally,' she added. Ciani asked the judge to order Chyna's previous testimony about damages to be stricken from the record and that she be allowed to take the witness stand again. Rhodes denied any wrongdoing, telling the court: 'The premise that I tricked the witness (Chyna) into seeing those photographs is absurd.' Rob Kardashian testified on Wednesday that he feared for his life on a night in 2016 when his then-fiancee Blac Chyna pointed a gun at his head, pulled a phone-charging cable around his neck and repeatedly hit him with a metal rod while under the influence of substances. 'She strangled me, she put a gun to my head twice, she was on cocaine and alcohol,' Kardashian said, his voice rising nearly to a shout in a Los Angeles courtroom as Chyna's attorney Lynne Ciani sought to cast doubt on the attack and its severity. During an emotional and contentious hour on the stand, Rob Kardashian grew angry when Ciani asked him why photos and video from the days that followed didn't show any marks on him, despite his testimony that she had hit him repeatedly with a 6-foot metal rod. 'Did you have as much as a Band-Aid on you?' the attorney asked. 'I just told you it didn't leave a mark on my face!' Rob Kardashian said.  'And the gun to my head two different times during the night didn't leave a mark to my temple!' Kris Jenner and Kim Kardashian watched the testimony from the front row of the gallery, and had no visible reaction. Chyna testified earlier in the trial that she was never violent toward Rob Kardashian. She said that on the night of Dec. 14 and the morning of Dec. 15, 2016, the couple had been celebrating the news that 'Rob & Chyna' was getting a second season. The all-night celebration turned into a bitter fight by morning, when he took her phone and shut himself in a closet, looking for evidence of communications with other men, she said. She testified that earlier in the evening, she had wrapped a phone-charging cord around Rob Kardashian's neck playfully because he was ignoring her, and picked up a gun he kept around, always unloaded, from a nightstand as a joke. The chain of events would lead to the end of the relationship, and their show. Rob Kardashian, 35, the youngest of Kris Jenner's four children with the late Robert Kardashian, has kept a much lower public profile than his mother and sisters.  He was mostly an offscreen character, and only occasionally appeared, on the family's reality show. He broke from the pattern in 2016, spending a year in the limelight before it went bad.  He and Chyna began dating in January, announced their engagement in April, announced they were having a child together in May, had their own reality show premiere in September, and had a daughter, Dream, in November. He testified Wednesday that he felt in retrospect that their love was never real, and that he had been at the 'weakest, worst point' in his life when their relationship began. He said the coupling was 'toxic' from the start, and that she beat him at least five times during the yearlong relationship. 'Strangling someone, beating someone, that's not a family,' he said.  'That's not love to me.' Rob Kardashian wore a loose-fitting, untucked black dress shirt on the stand.  His otherwise dark testimony drew a laugh from most of the courtroom when Ciani suggested that two videos she showed were shot on the same day because he was wearing the same thing. 'That doesn't mean anything,' he said. 'I wear the same thing every day.' Rob Kardashian is not a defendant in this trial.  Chyna's allegations against him, stemming from the same incidents, will get a separate trial when this one is done. Earlier on Wednesday, Corey Gamble, a key witness backing up Rob Kardashian's account of the assault, insisted that he saw Chyna punch him and whip him with a phone-charging cord, as Ciani tried to poke holes in his story.  'I said that she attacked him,' testified Gamble, the longtime boyfriend and sometime co-star of 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' matriarch Kris Jenner.  'What I saw is what I saw.' Gamble said he rushed to the house the couple was staying in after Kris Jenner got an early morning call from her son, who sounded deeply distressed. When he arrived, he said, Chyna was holding some sort of metal rod, and threw it down.  She rushed toward Rob Kardashian, whipping the phone cord at him then punching him. 'By the time she got to him, she started hitting him,' Gamble testified.  'I was able to get in the middle of them two. I even got hit two or three times.' Gamble said Chyna threw a chair at Rob Kardashian's car as he was leaving, then attempted to pick up a table but Gamble stopped her. During cross-examination, Ciani had Gamble read from a declaration he submitted in the case two years earlier, in which he said he arrived to find Chyna hitting Rob Kardashian with her fists, but made no mention of any of the objects. 'You didn't see sufficient to mention the metal rod, the cord or the table?' Ciani asked. 'I don't know why I didn't include those details,' Gamble said.",

The Coral Geographer, which costs $3,000 a night, docked in Darwin on Tuesday and the affected passengers and crew - who had been restricted to their cabins - were allowed to disembark and were taken to isolation facilities. There were 74 passengers and 38 crew on board the cruise, and around 50 were allowed to disembark after they were screened and tested negative, the NT News reported.  'This was managed in Darwin (on Tuesday) by Coral Expeditions who arranged transport and lodgings in a safe manner and in full collaboration with health authorities,' Coral Expeditions Commercial director Jeff Gillies said. 'All unaffected guests and crew disembarked as normal.' One of the positive passengers described the situation on board as 'hellish' and said being forced into isolation in the cabin felt 'like a jail.' 'Your dinner (is) handed to you in plastic plates at 9pm,' the passenger said. 'It started with the staff. A staff member was the first to declare they were positive.' The passenger said there should have been a doctor on board, that sick passengers and crew should have been given access to telehealth to consult a medical practitioner.  The people affected by the virus were set to isolate at the DoubleTree hotel, after the Howard Springs quarantine facility was mothballed last month due to the end of isolation requirements for all entries. Passengers were advised to claim the hotel bills on their health insurance.",
  "d8d651150982e04ca6d9c0b21c56e83c36dc88e33b58ef22fd676a93": "'Beergate' may hurt Labour at the ballot box in this week's local elections, experts predicted last night. Tory peer and polling analyst Lord Hayward said: 'Beergate is dissipating the impact of Partygate. Two or three days ago, not many people knew about it but now there's no question that they do. Keir Starmer has had a tough time from the broadcasters and was unable to say whether it was an error after bashing Boris for making errors.' He added: 'There is no question that southern England's Waitrose Radio 4 Tories have been more angry about Partygate. But the existence of Beergate will have an impact to the extent that the anger will be aimed across all parties.' He said seats to watch were Bury, Sunderland, Nuneaton and Walsall, where the Tories might do well. Sir Keir has denied that he broke Covid rules after pictures emerged of him swigging beer with colleagues last year. Tory activists said Beergate was starting to come up on doorsteps in the Midlands on Friday. In Stoke, they said, locals quoted 'Beergate' back to canvassers, saying of politicians: 'They're all the same, aren't they.' Lord Hayward He said that there were two effects that the saga could have on voters ahead of Thursday's local elections. Firstly, it could convince wavering Tories who are angry about lockdown parties in Number 10 to vote, he said. But he said the bigger impact could be that the public takes the view of politicians that 'they're all the same', which could hurt both Labour and the Liberal Democrats. He said that Mr Johnson was likely to retain support in the Red Wall where Number 10 lockdown party issues are not cutting through. 'In your more white collar former industrial belt, there is less of an impact from Partygate. The Red Wall areas will hold up,' he said. 'Labour will have a bigger problem here. The party has still not got over being seen as toxic because of Jeremy Corbyn. 'Going back to Labour is going to be more difficult for people.' He said there will be 'less damage' from Partygate revelations in these areas because they see issues like Ukraine and the cost-of-living crisis as more important. 'They have a different perspective which is why in the home counties the impact [from Partygate] is greater in the midlands and north,' he said. 'Ukraine and cost of living is more salient there, and I think there is still a hangover from the vaccine bounce. 'They are much less likely to swing against the Tories. Boris Johnson can expect there will be less damage in those areas.' He also suggested that the Tories faced 'southern discomfort' in its traditional 'blue wall' shire and home county council seats. He warned that the areas most at risk were those whose voters were middle-class, Remain-oriented, well-educated and women. Hertfordshire, Surrey, Hampshire, Solihull and Trafford and other commuter belt areas are likely to lose votes to other parties, he warned. However, he said that Labour was unlikely to be the main beneficiary of this, with the Liberal Democrats and Greens picking up council seats from them. Lord Hayward said: 'The Tories face in the home countries what might be described as southern discomfort as the Lib Dems, Greens and other residents' groups may take council seats off them in their heartlands.'",
  "c2386504c82d28d3533fb67ff8d42dc2b24f02ffe599b8bacadbc5ea": "Republican lawmakers throughout the country celebrated the news of a Supreme Court draft opinion that is set to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision which legalized abortion - but have denounced the leak as an attempt to 'intimidate' the justices into changing their minds. Politico reported Monday night that Justice Samuel Alito, one of six justices appointed by Republican presidents on the nine-member court, wrote a majority draft opinion in February repudiating both Roe and the 1992 Planned Parenthood vs. Casey decision. 'Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,' Alito writes in the opinion, which was reportedly circulated among the court members. 'We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled,' he continues in the document, titled 'Opinion of the Court.' 'It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected representatives.' Republicans celebrated the decision, calling it a victory for the social conservatives and Christians who have worked for decades in lockstep to reach this moment. The draft document is not final until the court formally announces its decision in a case, meaning the ruling could technically still be changed. The court is expected to issue its final ruling before its term is up in late June or early July. That led to speculation from some on the right, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, that the Alito draft was leaked in the hopes public outrage could temper the court's decision. Indeed, following its release, several notable Democrats have already slammed the decision, saying they will not abide by it.  One Democratic Representative compared the decision to a dystopian novel, The Handmaid's Tale, while California Gov. Gavin Newsom vowed the state would 'fight like Hell' to oppose the ruling. 'Our daughters, sisters, mothers and grandmothers will not be silenced,' Newsom tweeted Monday night. 'The world is about to hear their fury.' Reaction to the news of Alito's draft opinion was swift Monday night, with conservative lawmakers celebrating the news after decades of fighting for an end to abortion rights - though they raised doubts about why the decision was leaked in the first place. Mike Gibbons, who is currently facing Trump-endorsed candidate JD Vance in the Republican primary for an Ohio Senate seat, wrote that the decision marked a 'huge pro-life victory,' noting it's 'great to see the Court recognize all life is protected under the Constitution. 'We still have to make sure we elect candidates that will continue to defend the unborn, which is exactly what I'll do in the U.S. Senate. Others, though, raised doubts about why the opinion was leaked to POLITICO, with Marco Rubio writing: 'The next time you hear the far left preaching about how they are fighting to preserve our Republic's institutions and norms remember how they leaked a Supreme Court opinion in an attempt to intimidate the justices on abortion.' Republican Josh Hawley, of Missouri, also tweeted that the leak is 'an unprecedented breach of confidentiality, clearly meant to intimidate.' 'The Justices mustn't give in to this attempt to corrupt the process,' Hawley wrote. 'Stay strong.' Embattled Congressmember Madison Cawthorn also tweeted that the story 'was meant to intimidate the Supreme Court into backing down.' 'Pray for the end of Roe v. Wade. Pray the Court will defend innocent life. Pray the Court will stand strong,' he urged his followers, noting:  'Evil MUST not triumph. Science, common sense, and LIFE will win.' And Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, of Georgia, said in a statement she is 'overwhelmed with emotion because this is the best news of our lifetime. 'This is a great victory for God and the unborn who have been innocently slain for years, my entire lifetime,' she said. 'I want to urge everyone to continue to pray, people all over our country, people all over our world, have been praying to end abortion. 'I want you to understand that there is going to be a major pushback in our country because there's going to be people that are going to fight to keep it and they're going to fight keep murdering the innocent unborn.  'I want you to dig in in prayer and faith and continue to pray that this actually comes true when they do release their opinion that Roe v Wade will be overturned and abortion will end and this will return the rights back to the states.  'I urge every single strong pro-life state to end it,' she wrote. On the left, Democrats and abortion rights activists slammed the decision - saying it is a 'nightmare scenario' as they vowed to fight the ruling. In a statement following the news, Planned Parenthood CEO Jodi Hicks said: 'This is the nightmare scenario we in the reproductive health, rights, and justice space have been sounding the alarm about and especially once the U.S. Supreme Court had a conservative majority. 'And now, if this opinion truly is reflective of the final decision of the majority of the U.S. Supreme Court Justices, then even if abortion remains legal today, we are just days away from more than 26 states banning access to abortion services, essential and safe health care that has been a constitutional right for nearly 50 years.' 'Make no mistake about it, the plan has always been to ban and criminalize abortion ever since 1973 when Roe v. Wade was decided,' she claimed.  A number of Democrats have since come out against the decision, with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying in a joint statement that the decision 'would go down as an abomination, one of the worst and most damaging decisions in modern history.' They also used the opportunity to slam former President Trump, saying: 'Several of these conservative justices, who are in no way accountable to the American people, have lied to the US Senate, ripped up the Constitution and defiled both precedent and the Supreme Court's reputation - all at the expense of tens of millions of women who could be stripped of their bodily autonomy and the Constitutional rights they've relied on for half a century. 'The party of Lincoln and Eisenhower has now completely devolved into the party of Trump,' the two top Congressional Democrats continued, adding: 'Every Republican Senator who supported Sen. McConnell and voted for Trump justices pretending that this day would never come will now have to explain themselves to the American people.' And one-time Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton also tweeted Monday night she is 'not surprised' by the news. 'This decision is a direct assault on the dignity, rights and lives of women, not to mention decades of settled law,' she wrote. 'It will kill and subjugate women even as a vast majority of Americans think abortion should be legal.  'What an utter disgrace.' Many have now said they would fight the decision if it were passed - either at the federal or the state level.  In New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy reminded his followers that he signed into law the Freedom of Reproductive Choice Act, which codifies the right to an abortion into New Jersey law. 'New Jersey will not go backwards on reproductive rights,' he wrote in a tweet. Meanwhile, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said abortions rights would not be overturned 'on my watch,' and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul also promised that 'abortion will always be safe and accessible in New York,' saying it will welcome anyone who says they need an abortion 'with open arms.' 'I refuse to let my new granddaughter have to fight for the rights that generations have fought for & won, rights that she should be guaranteed,' Hochul tweeted. At the same time, New York Attorney General Letitia James also promised in a tweet to 'do everything in our power to protect the right to an abortion' adding, 'Congress must act immediately to do the same.' And in Michigan, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said she will 'fight like hell to make sure abortion remains safe, legal and accessible in our state.' On the progressive end , woke Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, meanwhile, noted that Sen. Joe Manchin is preventing a vote on codifying abortion rights into law, while Sen. Bernie Sanders suggested ending the filibuster to get it passed. Sen. Elizabeth Warren also branded the Supreme Court 'extremist' in a tweet saying it will 'impose its far-right, unpopular views on the entire country. 'It's time for the millions who support the Constitution and abortion rights to stand up and make their voices heard,' Warren wrote. 'We're not going back--not ever.' Maryland Democrat Rep. Jamie Raskin, meanwhile, warned that Alito's decision could also lead to bans on birth control as he claimed the decision is reminiscent of The Handmaid's Tale. He was referring to the novel by Margaret Atwood - which was later turned into a television show. In both iterations, women are forced by the state to give birth. 'The basic legal claim here is that the word 'abortion' doesn't appear in the Constitution, and of course it doesn't appear in the Constitution,' Raskin, a Constitutional lawyer, explained to MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Monday night. 'But the Supreme Court in 1973, in Roe v. Wade or Griswold v. Connecticut - which was a 1965 decision by the Supreme Court striking down a law banning birth control, even for married couples in Connecticut - the Supreme Court said that the due process liberty clause include a right to privacy, over intimate decision making. 'So the point is that Justice Alito's decision would also apply, presumably, to the right to privacy in contraception,' he continued. 'If Casey is to fall, if Roe v. Wade is to fall, then Griswold v. Connecticut presumably is to follow as well because the word 'contraception' or 'birth control' doesn't appear in the Constitution [either].  'So this would appear to be an invitation to have Handmaid's Tale-type anti-feminist regulation and legislation all over the country,' Raskin concluded.  The Supreme Court's draft decision has shaken the Supreme Court to its core, with barricades posted around the building shortly after the report was posted online. The highly-respected SCOTUSblog, which covers the court in-depth, noted: 'The document leaked to Politico is almost certainly an authentic draft opinion by J. Alito that reflects what he believes at least 5 members of the Court have voted to support -- overruling Roe. But as Alito's draft, it does not reflect the comments or reactions of other Justices.' 'It's impossible to overstate the earthquake this will cause inside the Court, in terms of the destruction of trust among the Justices and staff. This leak is the gravest, most unforgivable sin,' SCOTUSblog tweeted.  Other observers called it a crisis for Roberts' tenure as chief justice. 'The article represents the greatest crisis that Chief Justice John Roberts has faced in his tenure on the Court,' wrote legal scholar Jonathan Turley. Turley also pointed out the leak happened to put pressure on the court to change its ruling before it's publicly announced.  'The most likely motivation is obviously to pressure the Court and push the legislation in Congress on a federal abortion law before the midterm elections. It will also likely renew the call for court packing,' he added.  And Democratic campaign strategist Brian Fallon tweeted: 'Is a brave clerk taking this unprecedented step of leaking a draft opinion to warn the country what's coming in a last-ditch Hail Mary attempt to see if the public response might cause the Court to reconsider?'  Such a ruling would immediately become an issue in the 2022 midterm election where Democrats are struggling to keep control of Congress.  Abortion would also become a major political issue in governors' races with states being given the right to determine whether or not to allow the procedure.   The original Roe v. Wade case was filed in 1971 by Norma McCorvey, a 22-year-old living in Texas who was unmarried and seeking a termination of her unwanted pregnancy. She married at the age of 16, but separated shortly after while she was pregnant. She gave custody of her daughter to her mother. She gave a second child up for adoption, but when she got pregnant a third time she decided to have an abortion. She said she couldn't afford to travel to one of the handful of states where it would have been legal. Because of state legislation preventing abortions unless the mother's life is at risk, she was unable to undergo the procedure in a safe and legal environment. So McCorvey sued Henry Wade, the Dallas county district attorney, in 1970. The case went on to the Supreme Court, under the filing Roe vs Wade, to protect McCorvey's privacy. Sarah Weddington and a former classmate, Linda Coffee, brought a class-action lawsuit on behalf of a pregnant woman challenging a state law that largely banned abortions. She had been among only five women out of a class of 1,600 to graduate with a law degree from the University of Texas in 1967. In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court recognized a woman's constitutional right to an abortion in Roe v. Wade. The landmark ruling legalized abortion nationwide but divided public opinion and has been under attack ever since. The landmark ruling saw abortions decriminalized in 46 states, but under certain specific conditions which individual states could decide on. For example, states could decide whether abortions were allowed only during the first and second trimester but not the third (typically beyond 28 weeks). Among pro-choice campaigners, the decision was hailed as a victory which would mean fewer women would become seriously - or even fatally - ill from abortions carried out by unqualified or unlicensed practitioners. Moreover, the freedom of choice was considered a significant step in the equality fight for women in the country. Victims of rape or incest would be able to have the pregnancy terminated and not feel coerced into motherhood. However, pro-lifers contended it was tantamount to murder and that every life, no matter how it was conceived, is precious. Though the decision has never been overturned, anti-abortionists have prompted hundreds of states laws since then narrowing the scope of the ruling.",
  "a5b76075bfd34c56653951b9b8f686a50a92ba2e27fa724faff489fa": "A man who allegedly assaulted an anti-communist protester has been charged by police. The NSW Police Force confirmed officers have now charged a 48-year-old man with assault following Drew Pavlou's, 20, viral political protest in Eastwood, Sydney, on Saturday.  An angry mob surrounded Mr Pavlou on Saturday night after he held up a sign which read 'f*** Xi Jinping' at a busy Asian market in one of Sydney's highest Chinese population suburbs. 'F*** you, motherf***er,' one bystander screamed at him repeatedly. Another person punched Mr Pavlou's sign and told him: 'America has genocide, not Xi Jinping.' Video shows how the situation quickly escalated when two men attempted to take the camera from Mr Pavlou's friend and snatched his sign away. Several women in the crowd told Mr Pavlou he was a coward and to 'f*** off' while he remained standing in the street.  Police were forced to intervene as the situation worsened but there were no reports of serious injury. 'My point is a simple one - I should be able to insult a dictator like Xi Jinping in my own country without being physically assaulted and attacked,' Mr Pavlou wrote on Facebook. 'Australia is a democracy and we should be free to insult any leader no matter how coarsely - this is a simple principle of free speech. 'No way would I have been surrounded by 50 people and physically assaulted if I held up a sign saying 'F*** Scott Morrison' in Sydney. 'Why should Chinese ultra-nationalists get a free pass to assault people in Australia if someone insults Xi Jinping?' The 48-year-old man was charged with assault on Monday and is due to appear at Hornsby Local Court on June 1.  On Sunday, Mr Pavlou claimed NSW Police had called him to inform him they were conducting an investigation into his protest. 'New South Wales police just called me to tell me I'm getting charged for holding a sign saying 'f*** Xi Jinping' in Sydney,' he tweeted. 'They won't tell me what the exact charge is and they won't tell me whether the men who physically assaulted us are being charged.' NSW Police has not yet laid any formal charges against Mr Pavlou.  Mr Pavlou - based in Brisbane - was in Sydney to support Democratic Alliance candidate Kyinzom Dhongdue, who has Tibetan heritage is running for the seat of Bennelong. Mr Pavlou has repeatedly made headlines since organising a protest movement in support of democracy in Hong Kong and the University of Queensland. He launched the Drew Pavlou Democratic Alliance (DPDA) federal political party in December of last year and is running for the Federal Senate at the May 21 election. His party pledges to fight corruption, protect human rights, tackle poverty and homelessness and build a green economy.",
  "6c1f9014731e5c1e68b2e67e7fe383206084b73dab21ea0132c1622e": "The Supreme Court has voted to strike down Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that legalized abortion in the United States, a bombshell report revealed on Monday. The history of the legislation, which has proved controversial since it was made in 1973, dates back half a century. The case was filed in 1971 by Norma McCorvey, a 22-year-old living in Texas who was unmarried and seeking a termination of her unwanted pregnancy.  She married at the age of 16, but separated shortly after while she was pregnant. She gave custody of her daughter to her mother.

She had been among only five women out of a class of 1,600 to graduate with a law degree from the University of Texas in 1967.  The Supreme Court handed down the watershed 7-2 decision that a woman's right to make her own medical decisions, including the choice to have an abortion, is protected under the 14th Amendment.  In particular, that the Due Process Clause of the the 14th Amendment provides a fundamental 'right to privacy' that protects a woman's liberty to choose whether or not to have an abortion. The landmark ruling saw abortions decriminalized in 46 states, but under certain specific conditions which individual states could decide on. For example, states could decide whether abortions were allowed only during the first and second trimester but not the third (typically beyond 28 weeks).  Among pro-choice campaigners, the decision was hailed as a victory which would mean fewer women would become seriously - or even fatally - ill from abortions carried out by unqualified or unlicensed practitioners.

Victims of rape or incest would be able to have the pregnancy terminated and not feel coerced into motherhood. However, pro-lifers contended it was tantamount to murder and that every life, no matter how it was conceived, is precious. Though the decision has never been overturned, anti-abortionists have prompted hundreds of states laws since then narrowing the scope of the ruling. Following the ruling, McCorvey lived a quiet life until the 1980s when she revealed herself to be Jane Roe. McCorvey became a leading, outspoken pro-abortion voice in American discourse, even working at a women's clinic where abortions were performed. However,  she performed an unlikely U-turn in 1995, becoming a born-again Christian and began traveling the country speaking out against the procedure. In 2003, a she filed a motion to overturn her original 1973 ruling with the U.S. district court in Dallas. The motion moved through the courts until it was ultimately denied by the Supreme Court in 2005. McCorvey died at an assisted living home in Texas in February 2017, aged 69. She admitted before she died that she made the change in exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars. This is my deathbed confession,' she says. 'I took their money and they took me out in front of the cameras and told me what to say. That's what I'd say.'  In the interview, McCorvey refers to herself as 'the Big Fish' in the eyes of evangelical leaders who were eager to have her publicly switch sides and take up their cause.  In addressing her activism for the religious right, McCorvey boasts: 'I'm a good actress.' Shelley Lynn Thornton, now 51, is the biological daughter of Norma McCorvey and spoke on the record for the first time in 2021. Shelley appeared on Good Morning America for her first ever TV interview. Her identity was only made public in September by The Atlantic.   'A lot of people didn't know I existed,' she said, adding she fears the world blames her for abortion being legal.  'It doesn't revolve around me, I wasn't the one who created this law. I'm not the one who created this movement. I had nothing to do with it. I was just a little itty-bitty thing and, you know, circumstances prevailed.  'My whole thinking is that, 'oh God everybody is going to hate me because everyone is going to blame me for abortion being legal,' she said.  Thornton, who never met her birth mother in person before her death in 2017, told journalist Joshua Prager she had decided to speak out after more than half a century because she wanted to free herself from the 'secrets and lies.' 'Secrets and lies are, like, the two worst things in the whole world. I'm keeping a secret, but I hate it,' she said, in an adapted excerpt from Prager's new book 'The Family Roe: An American Story', published in The Atlantic.   'I want everyone to understand that this is something I've chosen to do.'   Politico reported Monday night that Justice Samuel Alito, one of six justices appointed by Republican presidents on the nine-member court, wrote a majority draft opinion in February repudiating both Roe and the 1992 Planned Parenthood vs. Casey decision. 'Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,' Alito writes in the opinion, which was reportedly circulated among the court members. 'We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled,' he continues in the document, titled 'Opinion of the Court.' 'It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected representatives.' The news sent shock waves throughout Washington D.C. with Democrats vowing to codify the legal right to an abortion into law and Republicans celebrating the news.  Politico noted that this is the first such case in modern history of a Supreme Court draft decision being leaked to the public while the case was still pending. The draft document is not final until the court formally announces its decision in a case, meaning the ruling could still be changed. The court is expected to issue its final ruling before its term is up in late June or early July.",
  "8037a34c6d3de0571ef1011d1f50e543f6e2c3e0e1794f62e08486ff": "Former top William Tyrrell cop Gary Jubelin has been grilled by a judge over his use of disproved historical sexual assault charges to wrongly target a washing machine repairman in the missing toddler case. Mr Jubelin spent Tuesday in the witness box of the NSW Supreme Court being questioned by lawyers for Bill Spedding. Mr Jubelin repeatedly said 'I can't recall' in response to questions about using the child sex allegations thrown out of court years before to gain leverage over Mr Spedding as a potential William Tyrrell suspect. He said the William Tyrrell case was of such 'magnitude' that he was distracted from the child sex assault case against Mr Spedding which he described as 'a side issue'. Adrian Canceri for Mr Spedding quoted from the ex-detective's best selling book I  Catch Killers, in which he wrote 'I'm about to pull the trigger on a guy's life'. This was Mr Jubelin describing charging Mr Spedding, who in the book he said 'is weird ... has a strange nasal voice and a sly way of answering questions'.  The child sex assault charges from 1987, which were dismissed at trial in 2016, had been previously rejected by a judge years earlier because the female complainants were found to have been coached. Mr Jubelin said he 'couldn't recall' details about those findings, 'can't recall' details about child welfare files on Mr Spedding and children, and had only 'a vague recollection' of attending the trial at which Mr Spedding was acquitted. Justice Ian Harrison, who is presiding over Mr Spedding's malicious prosecution suit against the State of NSW, which has heard  Mr Jubelin is 'in effect' a defendant, interrupted to pose a series of questions the former William Tyrrell case boss.  In twelve consecutive questions His Honour asked Mr Jubelin what he knew about the discounted sex allegations, and whether he used them as a 'way to put extra pressure' on Mr Spedding 'to crack him  open' on Tyrrell. After initially denying that was his tactic, Mr Jubelin eventually agreed. Justice Harrison: 'What would you say If it were suggested to you that proceedings against (Mr Spedding) for sexual assault allegations 30 years before had been instituted against him to put pressure on him in relation to William Tyrrell?' Gary Jubelin: 'I would strongly deny it.' JH: 'Was it your hope or desire that charging him with sexual assault allegations would be enough to crack him open on William Tyrrell?' GJ: 'The charge came first, then the consideration of what we would do with the circumstances.' JH: 'Would I be correct to read if he is hiding something maybe this (the sexual allegations charges) is enough to crack him open?' GJ: 'That's not an unfair reading'.    Mr Jubelin agreed that the quote in his book about 'putting a trigger' on Bill Spedding's life 'sounds dramatic ... but bear in mind it's a memoir'. Asked by Mr Canceri if 'it's a fact you pulled the trigger on Mr Spedding's life, Mr Jubelin replied 'I understand the seriousness of charging a person and the effect it would have on his life'. He acknowledged that in I Catch Killers he had written that charging Mr Spedding with the crimes and getting it wrong 'would destroy him'. Mr Canceri: 'There will be public court hearings at which he will be accused of being a paedophile?'. Mr Jubelin: 'I don't rush into charging him, I understand the magnitude. It's not taken lightly.' Mr Canceri: 'You would agree it has essentially destroyed him?' Mr Jubelin: 'I would agree it has had a dramatic impact.' Asked if he 'would agree after (Mr Spedding) being charged, he would be seen as a paedophile?', Mr Jubelin said 'that would be fair comment'.  Mr Spedding was later cleared of any involvement in William Tyrrell's disappearance.  In the week that William vanished in September 2014, Mr Spedding had visited the Kendall home of William's foster grandmother on the NSW Mid North Coast to repair a broken washing machine. Mr Spedding is claiming his arrest over the historical sexual charges of which he was eventually cleared was a 'collateral attack' designed to expose him back then as a possible suspect in William's disappearance. Mr Spedding claims he was was targeted by Mr Jubelin, who has since left the force and been convicted over illegally taping another Tyrrell suspect.  Mr Canceri said Strike Force Rosann which probed the Tyrrell case, knew by January 2015 that a Supreme Court justice had cleared Mr Spedding and had 'excoriated' a witness.   That witness had 'coaxed and tutored (children) to make claims of sexual assault against' Mr Spedding, and the Tyrrell detectives were well aware of this, Mr Canceri said. A forensic psychiatrist had testified that one of the children could have been coerced into claiming sexual assault because a threat of 'potential death by AIDS could have frightened' her. The court heard that Mr Spedding was acquitted of the historical charges in 2018 despite the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuing a case against him that was 'utterly hopeless and doomed to fail'. Justice Ian Harrison told the court in a pre-trial hearing last month that Mr Jubelin was a 'major player' in the events which sparked the proceedings, although he was not personally being sued by Mr Spedding. Lawyers for the State of NSW have been granted permission to rely on a statement by Mr Jubelin and possibly call the ex-cop to give evidence at the malicious prosecution trial.  Mr Jubelin was convicted and sentenced of four breaches of the Surveillance Devices Act and lost his appeal in 2020. ",
  "94d204f66d4e04a3f73f67bcf8c28ba4dfbe8fc66da4fe2858aa9e51": "Scott Morrison has denied today's interest rate hike has cost him the federal election.  The Prime Minister urged Aussies to stick with him after the Reserve Bank hiked interest rates to 0.35 per cent, which will result in higher mortgage payments for thousands of home owners. At a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, Mr Morrison was asked 'has your government just lost this election?'  The Prime Minister replied: 'Of course not'.  He blamed global factors for Australia's 5.1 per cent inflation rate including war in Europe and 'the hangover effects cause by the pandemic'. The last time interest rates rose during an election campaign came just before fellow Liberal PM John Howard was booted out of office after 11 years in 2007.  Mr Morrison has dismissed parallels with Mr Howard, pointing out that interest rates were above six per cent in 2007 and before today were at a historic low of 0.1 per cent. But like the Liberal legend he said he has 'sympathy' for Aussies whose mortgage payments will increase.  Mr Morrison talked up his record in handling the pandemic and urged Australians not to risk a Labor government. 'We've steered this country through one of our most difficult times. The stresses and the pressures are intense,' he said. 'For those that are paying more, that will be hard, and we understand that.' The Prime Minister said Australians were prepared for rising rates and pointed out that the proportion of borrowers on fixed rate mortgages has doubled to 40 per cent.  'Australians have been preparing for this for some time,' he said. 'Throughout the pandemic, we've seen them double the buffers on their mortgages... and strengthen their balance sheets in preparation.'   The cash rate rise of 0.25 per cent was much bigger than the 0.15 percentage point rise financial markets were expecting. The official rate now stands at 0.35 per cent - the highest since March 2020 at the start of the pandemic - after inflation in the year to March soared by 5.1 per cent - the fastest pace in 21 years. 'We are now in this journey out of the pandemic,' Mr Morrison said on Tuesday after the decision.  'Inflation has picked up significantly and more than expected. 'Of course, a 25 basis point increase in the cash rate, that will be harder and we understand that.'  Governor Philip Lowe said:  'The economy has proven to be resilient and inflation has picked up more quickly, and to a higher level, than was expected.' Three of Australia's Big Four banks - ANZ, Westpac and NAB - are expecting the Reserve Bank to take the cash rate to two per cent by 2023 as rates increase seven more times, with more pain possibly coming in June. Dr Lowe hinted more rate rises were likely in 2022 and 2023 with inflation at the highest level since 2001. 'Given this, and the very low level of interest rates, it is appropriate to start the process of normalising monetary conditions,' he said. Dr Lowe is also expecting the era of low wages growth that began in mid-2013 to be over this year, after last year declaring weak pay increases could help the RBA to keep rates on hold until 2024 'at the earliest'. 'There is also evidence that wages growth is picking up,' he said. With inflation well above the RBA's two to three per cent target, the word was mentioned 13 times in the May monetary policy meeting statement, issued on Tuesday, with a hint of more rate rises. 'The Board is committed to doing what is necessary to ensure that inflation in Australia returns to target over time,' Dr Lowe said. 'This will require a further lift in interest rates over the period ahead.' More than 1.5million borrowers will be coping with a variable increase for the first time as monthly repayments on a typical $600,000 mortgage rise by $78. Shadow treasurer blamed the government even though the Reserve Bank said Russia's Ukraine war had pushed up inflation. 'This is a full blown cost of living crisis on Scott Morrison's watch.  'The PM has an excuse for everything and a plan for nothing,' he said. 'If only you could pay your mortgage with Scott Morrison's excuses.' Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said he respected the Reserve Bank's independence and its decision to withdraw emergency-level support for the economy. 'We don't have an axe to grind with the Reserve Bank,' he said.  Westpac and its subsidiary St George were the first bank to hint at an increase in variable mortgage rates. 'We are currently reviewing our variable interest rates following the RBA's cash rate decision,' it said. 'We will keep you up to date with any changes here.' Last month, the RBA predicted an increase in the cash rate to two per cent - a level unseen since May 2016, would cause a 15 per cent plunge in Australian property prices. CoreLogic research director Tim Lawless is expecting Sydney and Melbourne house prices to dive by 15 per cent in the year ahead, as interest rates keep rising. 'Most of the declines will be concentrated in those two cities because that's where affordability is most stretched and also where, arguably, they'll be facing some demographic headwinds just through interstate migration really favouring the smaller states,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'The counter argument to that is we see overseas borders opening up, we're going to be seeing more migration coming in but that generally tends to flow through to rental demand rather than purchasing demand.' Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart and Canberra, along with regional areas in coastal New South Wales, southern Queensland and northern Tasmania were likely to see smaller declines of five to 10 per cent. 'These markets tend to be a little bit more insulated partly because affordability is not quite as stretched,' Mr Lawless said.  Those markets are more affordable than Sydney and Melbourne and would continue to benefit from professionals who can work from home moving there.  A 15 per cent fall in Sydney's median house price of $1.417million would take values back to $1.204million - where they were in the middle of last year. $500,000 : Monthly repayments rising by $65 from $1,922 to $1,987 $600,000 : Monthly repayments rising by $78 from $2,306 to $2,384 $700,000 : Monthly repayments rising by $90 from $2,691 to $2,781 $800,000 : Monthly repayments rising by $103 from $3,075 to $3,178 $900,000 : Monthly repayments rising by $116 from $3,459 to $3,575 $1,000,000 : Monthly repayments rising by $130 from $3,843 to $3,973 Data based on variable rate increasing from 2.29 per cent to 2.54 per cent   A drop of the same magnitude in Melbourne would see the mid-point house price drop from $1.001million to $850,787, which would be the lowest level since May 2017. But with unemployment at just 3.95 per cent, the lowest level since 1974, Mr Lawless said forced sales would be unlikely. 'This will probably more a lack of demand and people looking to sell having to adjust their price expectations,' Mr Lawless said.  A 0.25 percentage point increase will see monthly repayments on a typical $600,000 mortgage to climb by $78, from $2,306 to $2,384. That's based on a bank passing on in full the RBA increasing, pushing up a popular variable rate from 2.29 per cent to 2.54 per cent.  $500,000: Monthly repayments rising by $521 from $1,922 to $2,443 $600,000: Monthly repayments rising by $625 from $2,306 to $2,931 $700,000: Monthly repayments rising by $729 from $2,691 to $3,420 $800,000: Monthly repayments rising by $833 from $3,075 to $3,908 $900,000: Monthly repayments rising by $937 from $3,459 to $4,396 $1,000,000: Monthly repayments rising by $1,042 from $3,843 to $4,885 Data based on variable rate rising from 2.29 per cent to 4.19 per cent before the Reserve Bank of Australia raised the cash rate  ",
  "f462d427417aa5b77ceb2a6ea76736641e82d225487982205efffd15": "Houses prices in some parts of Australia are continuing to surge by an annual pace of 55 per cent despite talk of the first interest rate rise in more than a decade. After a strong year, the Sydney and Melbourne property markets have slowed, and median prices have shrunk on a quarterly basis for the first time since 2020. The Reserve Bank of Australia raised interest rates on Tuesday, marking the first increase since November 2010 and ending the era of a record-low 0.1 per cent cash rate. The cash rate increase of 0.25 percentage points was well above market expectations of a 0.15 percentage point increase.  The end of two per cent fixed mortgage rates and the fastest annual inflation surge in 21 years, of 5.1 per cent, have curtailed price growth in Australia's two biggest property markets.  CoreLogic research director Tim Lawless said regional Australian housing markets had been somewhat insulated from the slowdown for now. 'Those markets will be relatively insulated but not completely coming into a downturn,' he told Daily Mail Australia.  'They have seen prices rising quite spectacularly over the past couple of years, generally off the back of a softer historical performance.' Pockets are regional area within a two-hour drive of Sydney are still going strong, as are parts of Adelaide and Brisbane. North Arm Cove, near Port Stephens and Hawks Nest north of Sydney, saw median house prices in the year to April surge by 54.9 per cent to $709,086, CoreLogic data showed. 1. NORTH ARM COVE, NSW: Up 54.9 per cent to $709,086 2. NORTH ROTHBURY, NSW: Up 48.5 per cent to $803,684 3. BLACKBUTT, QLD: Up 48.4 per cent to $312,516 4.

SHOALHAVEN HEADS: Up 45.4 per cent to $1,293,119 Source: CoreLogic median house prices in the year to April 2022  For roughly half of great Sydney's $1.417million mid-point, following a 17.1 per cent annual increase, it is possible to have water views of the picturesque Karuah River. Buyers able to work from home can also have a much smaller mortgage and a more relaxed lifestyle. The Hunter region had another strong performer with mid-point prices at North Rothbury, near Branxton, surging by 48.5 per cent to $803,684. Nearby areas a short drive from the Hunter Valley vineyards had strong growth too with increases of more than 45 per cent recorded at Cessnock ($604,588), Paterson ($980,289), Greta ($744,251) and Bellbird Heights ($631,563). Inland from Queensland's Sunshine Coast, the small town of Blackbutt near Nanango had a 48.4 per cent increase to $312,516. On the other side of Brisbane, the semi-rural area of Cedar Grove near Jimboomba saw its mid-point house price rise by 46.6 per cent to $795,665. Values there are more affordable than greater Brisbane's $880,332, following an annual increase of 32 per cent. Beaumont, in Adelaide's east, also did well with median prices rising by 46 per cent to $1,739,103. This was even better than greater Adelaide's impressive annual increase of 28.4 per cent which took median house prices to $676,546. Regional New South Wales had the most postcodes where prices rose by more than 45 per cent during the past year.  Bellingen, an upmarket hinterland area near Coffs Harbour on the Mid-North Coast, saw its median price increase by 45.7 per cent to $1,053,706. On the South Coast, Shoalhaven Heads on the beach east of Nowra had a 45.4 per cent increase, taking prices to  $1,293,119. Australia's median property price in April grew at an annual pace of 16.7 per cent to $748,635, but this marked a marked slowdown from last year's 22 per cent increase which was the fastest annual growth since 1989. With a 20 per cent deposit factored in, a borrower paying off a typical Australian home would have a $598,098 mortgage. So someone with a $600,000 hone loan will soon see their monthly repayments rise by $78, from $2,306 to $2,384, after the RBA raised the cash rate by 0.25 percentage points to 0.35 per cent from a record-low of 0.1 per cent. That's assuming the banks pass the RBA rate rise on in full, taking a typical variable mortgage rate from 2.29 per cent to 2.54 per cent.  The move on Tuesday afternoon was the first official interest rate rise since November 2010 and the first during an election campaign since November 2007.  Three of Australia's Big Four banks - ANZ, Westpac and NAB - are expecting the cash rate to hit two per cent by 2023. The RBA last month predicted this would see a 15 per cent fall in Australian home prices. Mr Lawless said the housing market was likely to slow later this year as interest rates rose. 'With the RBA cash rate set to rise, we are likely to see a further loss of momentum in housing conditions over the remainder of the year and into 2023,' he said. Mr Lawless said a series of interest rate rises would most likely cause a 15 per cent drop in Sydney and Melbourne house prices.  But he predicted regional markets would see a milder drop of five to 10 per cent, like Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart and Canberra. Markets within a two-hour drive of a capital like Queensland's Sunshine Coast would be better protected from a downturn. 'Some of these markets that are commutable as well as livable will probably be the ones that see demand holding up much better than say more rural,' Mr Lawless said. $500,000 : Monthly repayments rising by $65 from $1,922 to $1,987 $600,000 : Monthly repayments rising by $78 from $2,306 to $2,384 $700,000 : Monthly repayments rising by $90 from $2,691 to $2,781 $800,000 : Monthly repayments rising by $103 from $3,075 to $3,178 $900,000 : Monthly repayments rising by $116 from $3,459 to $3,575 $1,000,000 : Monthly repayments rising by $130 from $3,843 to $3,973 Data based on variable rate increasing from 2.29 per cent to 2.54 per cent  ",
  "beed7b3d401c33342aa551f3428cb3c15542d95ff22767ac3fd3ff68": "The Kardashians won a massive victory Monday with a Los Angeles jury awarding reality star Blac Chyna zero damages in her lawsuit against America's most famous TV family. The 33 year-old had accused Kim Kardashian, her sisters Khloe and Kylie Jenner and their mother, Kris Jenner, of making statements that ruined or defamed her reputation and of plotting to get her TV show Rob and Chyna axed. On Friday, Kim was dropped from the defamation part of the suit. But on Monday, the jury returned a verdict that, while it did not completely exonerate the billionaire clan of any wrongdoing, still awarded Chyna no damages at all. Chyna sat in stunned silence as the court clerk announced their decision. The case went to the jury at 4.30pm last Thursday and the 12 men and women on the panel took till 3.30pm on Monday to reach their verdict. Under California law, civil trials require at least 9 jurors to vote in favor of a verdict. Unlike the the rest of the trial, there was no fashion parade of Kardashians at the Stanley Mosk Courthouse in downtown LA. Kim, 41, Khloe, 37, Kylie, 24 and Kris, 66, were all 3,000 miles away at the glittering Metropolitan Gala in New York City.  Only their attorney, Michael Rhodes, was in court to represent them. Chyna's lawyer, Lynne Ciani, said after the verdict, 'The jury found that Chyna had not physically abused Rob Kardashian and that they interfered with her contract. 'We will appeal the remaining questions.' The Los Angeles trial lasted almost two weeks before lawyers for both sides wound up their closing arguments and the case went to the jury at 4:30pm on Thursday. Under California law, civil trials require at least nine jurors to vote in favor of a verdict. If nine or more can't agree, the judge can declare a mistrial. That would essentially mean that neither side won - and a new trial, with a new jury, could be convened, in which the case would be tried all over again. After about 10 hours of deliberations, the jurors found on the long jury form that the Kardashians often acted in bad faith on the issues brought up in the case, but that it had no substantial effect on Chyna's contract or the fate of the show. As a result, she was awarded no damages.  On the 13-page special verdict form, the most significant of the 70 questions the jury had to answer was number 69: 'What are Angela White's damages?' Angela White is the real name of Blac Chyna.  The jurors left the answer blank. The jury did find, however, that all four Kardashian defendants' actions with respect to Chyna's 'Rob and Chyna' contract with E! were 'not justified.' And they found that only Kylie Jenner's 'conduct prevented performance (of Chyna) or make performance more expensive or better.'  The jury did not find the same for the other three family members. Kylie was also singled out as the only one the jury felt 'intended to disrupt the performance' of Chyna's contract with E! The jurors decided that Kylie's statement - 'She (Chyna) will proceed with using and physically abusing my brother' - was not true. But they answered 'no' when asked: 'Was Kylie Jenner's conduct a substantial factor in causing harm to Angela White?' They also found that Kris Jenner's claim that 'she (Chyna) beat the s*** out of Rob's face,' was not true. But her other statement - that 'she beat the s*** out of him' - was true. Rhodes, representing the Kardashians, urged the jury in his summing up on Friday 'to let the family start to heal.' He said there was no substance to Chyna's suit, seeking damages for economic loss of $108 million, saying she had failed to present any hard financial evidence of loss of income or of emotional distress. Rhodes said that Chyna was violent and aggressive. 'Did Chyna beat the s*** out of Rob? Yes, she did,' he said. 'It was true. It happened.' Rhodes referred to the day of Chyna and her 35-year-old boyfriend's 'big fight' in December 2016, when she packed up and left their home with their baby girl, Dream, born a month earlier. Rob Kardashian said that she hit him with a six-foot rod, pulled a phone cord around his neck and twice pointed a gun at his head. During her testimony, Chyna, 33, denied that they broke up at that point. Chyna maintains their relationship ended in the summer of 2017, but the defendants say Chyna acknowledged in a written declaration that the two split in December 2016. Rhodes told jurors on Thursday that she denied the relationship had ended because she wanted to show the television program was still viable. 'She had to confirm the relationship was still ok because she has to convince you that the network still wanted her show,' Rhodes said. 'This was not a relationship that any network executive wants on TV.' 'Rob and Chyna' premiered in September 2016 and ran for one season. The series was renewed for a second season, but in light of Kardashian and Chyna's breakup, plans for Season 2 were put on hold. Chyna alleges the Kardashians spread false reports of her assaulting him in order to have the 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' spinoff canceled and ruin her reality TV career.  E! network executives testified during the trial that 'Rob & Chyna' was supposed to be a light-hearted romantic comedy. The court was also told that a producer on the show told Chyna that if she wanted a second season of the show, she would have to mend her relationship with Kardashian, and suggested counseling could help. Rhodes on Thursday said Chyna's reaction to the idea was: 'F*** no, f*** that. 'F*** Rob. I'm not doing that.' Rhodes asked the jury: 'Is this the relationship you want to build your romantic comedy around? 'Somebody who would say that to her baby's father? Would you put this on the air?' Asking the jury to 'walk with me' over to his clients - Rhodes represents Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner, who are all defendants - he pointed at the assembled Kardashians and said: 'This is the child's grandmother, her aunts.' Rhodes told the jury to recall the 'pain and anguish' on Rob Kardashian's face during his testimony on Wednesday, noting: 'That was real. This is a real family. 'Yes they're famous, but they're real people. 'Just because Rob is a big guy, doesn't mean he can't be a victim. 'How would you feel if you child went through this? 'Picture Rob. What did he look like? Was that fake?' Rhodes also accused Chyna of 'hiding her money' and not filing tax returns for three years. Under oath, Chyna admitted that she told her accountant to stop preparing her tax returns for the year 2019 and has not paid taxes since. 'You cheated the government - but we're going to give you millions of dollars - is that right?' he asked the jury. 'That's concealment.' She was accused during the fight of smashing a TV, a bedroom door and a Christmas gingerbread house. 'The gingerbread house was silly, over the top and beautiful - like the Kardashians,' said Rhodes. 'When she smashed it, she was venting her anger on everything she was not going to be.' Earlier on Thursday, the judge denied Chyna's request to repeat her testimony against the Kardashians after she became upset and walked off the stand when she was shown a nude photo of herself during cross-examination.  December 14, 2016 -  Chyna says she and her then-fiance were 'laughing and joking and being silly' as they celebrated season two of Rob and Chyna being greenlit by NBC  Universal.  She denies yelling 'I'm going to kill you' to Rob. She told the court that she pointed the gun upwards and didn't put her finger where the trigger was.   Chyna says she put a phone chord around Rob's neck 'as a joke', because 'he was playing video games and I was just trying to get his attention.'  December 15, 2016 - Chyna smashes a TV and a gingerbread house and damages the bedroom door. She said she was furious at Rob for taking her phone in a fit of jealousy and locking himself in a closet to check her messages.  Kris Jenner's boyfriend, Corey Gamble, shows up at Rob and Chyna's home. Chyna says that he stood between her and Rob, telling Rob to get his car keys and get out of the house.  Chyna leaves the home with daughter Dream that morning. January 2017 - Chyna says she and Rob hiked together in Malibu. Rob reportedly goes with her to New York for her personal appearance at a strip club, where cameras followed her.  Chyna said she was also filmed by hand-held cameras at another Las Vegas appearance, which made her think they were shooting Rob and Chyna's season two.  July/August 2017 - Chyna learns Rob and Chyna had actually been cancelled. October 2017 -  Chyna files a $108 million defamation suit against Kris Jenner and Kylie, Khloe and Kim Kardashian and accuses them of forcing producers to cancel her show.  April 19, 2022 - The case finally goes to trial. May 2, 2022 - Chyna loses the case, and is awarded nothing in damages.  Judge Gregory W. Alarcon made the decision on Thursday afternoon to move on to closing arguments. Chyna's attorney Lynne Ciani rested the plaintiff's case on Thursday morning.  The photo is central to another trial that will begin soon after this one concludes.  Chyna is suing Rob Kardashian over the image, alleging he posted it online out of retribution. Kris Jenner, Kylie Jenner and Khloe Kardashian were in the front row of the courtroom early on Thursday.  Kim Kardashian was absent after attending most of the nine-day trial. Alarcon began reading the jury instructions in the case late Thursday morning. Ciani wrapped up her case Thursday by showing jurors a video deposition from Frances Berwick, an executive with NBCUniversal, E!'s parent company. Berwick said that a second season of 'Rob & Chyna' didn't go ahead because 'their relationship broke down.' Berwick said: 'Their relationship was in a sad place and we didn't think that it was a good fit for E! - which is frothy and escapist, on the lighter side.' Berwick said she had not had a conversation with Kris Jenner in which Kris threatened to pull 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians' if season two of 'Rob & Chyna' went ahead. Asked why NBCUniversal issued a press release in December 2016 announcing a new season, she said that didn't mean the series had been 'greenlit' but that it was only 'an indication of what we hoped to do.' She added that 'it would not be the first time' a press release had come out announcing a show that did not go forward later.   Chyna appeared in court Thursday wearing a black check jacket, black leggings and black spike heels, with an orange jacket over the top. Khloe Kardashian was also in attendance and arrived wearing a black tuxedo jacket over a silk shirt, black leggings and white sneakers.  Her mother, Kris Jenner wore black pants and a black blazer with white piping. During cross examination last week Rhodes presented Chyna with a copy of the restraining order she filed in 2017 against her ex-fiance, Rob Kardashian after he allegedly posted 'revenge porn' photos of her on social media. Attached to the restraining order documents were copies of the offending nude pictures which both parties in the case had previously agreed by stipulation would not be shown to the jury. Jurors did not see them, but Chyna did, and allegedly became 'upset' and rattled by the photos. Chyna was so distressed that when Rhodes grilled her later about the amount of damages she is seeking, she couldn't name a dollar figure and only gave vague answers to other questions he asked about damages, her lawyer claimed. Seeing the pictures 'derailed' Chyna's testimony, Ciani told Judge Alarcon. 'There was a stipulation that the photos would not be included which was violated intentionally,' she added. Ciani asked the judge to order Chyna's previous testimony about damages to be stricken from the record and that she be allowed to take the witness stand again. Rhodes denied any wrongdoing, telling the court: 'The premise that I tricked the witness (Chyna) into seeing those photographs is absurd.' Rob Kardashian testified on Wednesday that he feared for his life on a night in 2016 when his then-fiancee Blac Chyna pointed a gun at his head, pulled a phone-charging cable around his neck and repeatedly hit him with a metal rod while under the influence of substances. 'She strangled me, she put a gun to my head twice, she was on cocaine and alcohol,' Kardashian said, his voice rising nearly to a shout in a Los Angeles courtroom as Chyna's attorney Lynne Ciani sought to cast doubt on the attack and its severity. During an emotional and contentious hour on the stand, Rob Kardashian grew angry when Ciani asked him why photos and video from the days that followed didn't show any marks on him, despite his testimony that she had hit him repeatedly with a 6-foot metal rod. 'Did you have as much as a Band-Aid on you?' the attorney asked. 'I just told you it didn't leave a mark on my face!' Rob Kardashian said.  'And the gun to my head two different times during the night didn't leave a mark to my temple!' Kris Jenner and Kim Kardashian watched the testimony from the front row of the gallery, and had no visible reaction. Chyna testified earlier in the trial that she was never violent toward Rob Kardashian. She said that on the night of Dec. 14 and the morning of Dec. 15, 2016, the couple had been celebrating the news that 'Rob & Chyna' was getting a second season. The all-night celebration turned into a bitter fight by morning, when he took her phone and shut himself in a closet, looking for evidence of communications with other men, she said. She testified that earlier in the evening, she had wrapped a phone-charging cord around Rob Kardashian's neck playfully because he was ignoring her, and picked up a gun he kept around, always unloaded, from a nightstand as a joke. The chain of events would lead to the end of the relationship, and their show. Rob Kardashian, 35, the youngest of Kris Jenner's four children with the late Robert Kardashian, has kept a much lower public profile than his mother and sisters.  He was mostly an offscreen character, and only occasionally appeared, on the family's reality show. He broke from the pattern in 2016, spending a year in the limelight before it went bad.  He and Chyna began dating in January, announced their engagement in April, announced they were having a child together in May, had their own reality show premiere in September, and had a daughter, Dream, in November. He testified Wednesday that he felt in retrospect that their love was never real, and that he had been at the 'weakest, worst point' in his life when their relationship began. He said the coupling was 'toxic' from the start, and that she beat him at least five times during the yearlong relationship. 'Strangling someone, beating someone, that's not a family,' he said.  'That's not love to me.' Rob Kardashian wore a loose-fitting, untucked black dress shirt on the stand.  His otherwise dark testimony drew a laugh from most of the courtroom when Ciani suggested that two videos she showed were shot on the same day because he was wearing the same thing. 'That doesn't mean anything,' he said. 'I wear the same thing every day.' Rob Kardashian is not a defendant in this trial.  Chyna's allegations against him, stemming from the same incidents, will get a separate trial when this one is done. Earlier on Wednesday, Corey Gamble, a key witness backing up Rob Kardashian's account of the assault, insisted that he saw Chyna punch him and whip him with a phone-charging cord, as Ciani tried to poke holes in his story.  'I said that she attacked him,' testified Gamble, the longtime boyfriend and sometime co-star of 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' matriarch Kris Jenner.  'What I saw is what I saw.' Gamble said he rushed to the house the couple was staying in after Kris Jenner got an early morning call from her son, who sounded deeply distressed. When he arrived, he said, Chyna was holding some sort of metal rod, and threw it down.  She rushed toward Rob Kardashian, whipping the phone cord at him then punching him. 'By the time she got to him, she started hitting him,' Gamble testified.  'I was able to get in the middle of them two. I even got hit two or three times.' Gamble said Chyna threw a chair at Rob Kardashian's car as he was leaving, then attempted to pick up a table but Gamble stopped her. During cross-examination, Ciani had Gamble read from a declaration he submitted in the case two years earlier, in which he said he arrived to find Chyna hitting Rob Kardashian with her fists, but made no mention of any of the objects. 'You didn't see sufficient to mention the metal rod, the cord or the table?' Ciani asked. 'I don't know why I didn't include those details,' Gamble said.",
  "0bebb0f66f5ba669305f21d79d5bbb0a65573c3945e00a3e8ea28f2a": "Jetstar has launched its 18th birthday sale with the budget airline offering 400,000 'return for free' tickets.  The sale includes 59 domestic routes where fares are as low as $69 and 29 international routes which start from $199.  The sale will begin from 11:59pm on May 3 with early tickets available to club Jetstar members from midday.  The sale will close at 11:59pm on May 5 and the travel periods vary but range from mid-July 2022 until February 2023.  The airline has also announced a range of new 'destination inspired' seltzers to celebrate their 18th year of operation. These include a Bali version with hibiscus and rambutan flavours, a Gold Coast version with coconut and fairy floss, a 'deconstructed' cafe latte drop titled Melbourne, and a mulled wine and cinnamon seltzer called Queenstown.  The drinks are concocted by Melbourne based-brewery Hop Nation and will be available from May 17. While Jetstar's sale prices seem comparable with pre-Covid prices, a recent analysis by comparison site Finder found that some airfares rose by 112 per cent since 2019.  Finder looked at data from the Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics.  In 2019 the Perth-Sydney route cost travellers an average of $407 a ticket.  But in 2022 that went up to $862.  Melbourne-Perth was similar with its fares going from an average of $368 in 2019 to $611 in 2022. Angus Kidman from Finder said airlines were in the process of recovering from two years of being grounded. 'As demand increases and airlines strive to rebuild capacity, Australians should be prepared for flight costs to remain high,' Mr Kidman said. 'To make matters worse, rising fuel costs will contribute to even higher airfares, leaving Aussies faced with no option but to book flights early.' Not all routes rose in price, however.  The Melbourne to Sydney route dropped from $170 to $114 while the Brisbane to Cairns route dropped from $235 to $168, a drop of 28 per cent. The comparisons between 2019 and 2022 included January and February only to account for seasonal price fluctuations and are based on the cheapest available fare.

  "5ab4c83e2c3317b8d1957d8da65e16059d2538a2b5e7df8affb44ee9": "As royal residences go, Adelaide Cottage has neither the proportions nor grandeur of its larger, more illustrious neighbour. But what it lacks in stature, this picture-postcard cottage standing in the shadows of Windsor Castle more than makes up for in its intriguing role in one of the best-known love affairs of the 20th century. For back in the years following the Second World War, Adelaide Cottage was the grace-and-favour home of Group Captain Peter Townsend. He, of course, was the dashing RAF pilot and later equerry to King George VI who would precipitate a scandal, becoming the divorced lover of Princess Margaret. Back when it was built in 1831 by King William IV for his wife Queen Adelaide, the cottage was a day retreat for the royal couple. Although it seemingly fell out of favour with the queen after the death of her husband in 1837, it remained a popular destination for breakfast or tea with his successor, the young Queen Victoria. So popular, in fact, that a new private carriageway was created for her. Not only that, her beloved King Charles spaniel, Dash, was buried in the grounds. But the most intriguing interlude in the cottage's history came with the appointment of Peter Townsend to the King's staff. The Battle of Britain pilot was married to Rosemary and had a toddler son, Giles, and another, Hugo, on the way, when he was made the King's equerry in February 1944 and granted the use of a grace-and-favour property, tucked behind a ten-foot privet hedge, within walking distance of the 'office'. Adelaide Cottage became the first proper marital home for Townsend and his wife after three years of wartime marriage - though back then it was far from a glamorous proposition. Power was delivered along cables running from Windsor Castle, but the current was so poor it could only support a vacuum cleaner and a small electric heater at any one time. The inside of the cottage was apparently a gloomy affair, decorated with Victorian wallpaper and heavy furniture, which might explain why one 1950s commentator described it as 'poky and unattractive'. Not that it deterred a certain young princess - and her family - from visiting. When Townsend's second son was born, King George VI was named the boy's godfather and the christening tea, with two princesses in attendance, was held at Adelaide. As a 1950s report from this newspaper would later remark: 'It was the first of many Sunday visits. Princess Elizabeth liked to chat with Rosemary, while Princess Margaret played with the children on the lawn and Peter Townsend, off duty, sat back in a deckchair. 'Sometimes the King and Queen arrived to collect their daughters, more often Peter ran them home himself. Princess Margaret never came to Adelaide Cottage unless she was accompanied by Princess Elizabeth or the Queen. A schoolgirl when Townsend first moved in to the cottage, Margaret was largely unnoticed by Townsend at first. Although he made quite an impression on her. Years later the princess, who was 13 at the time of his appointment, would admit: 'When he first appeared, I had a terrific crush on him.' How intriguing then to think of the visits the young princess, together with her older sister, made to Adelaide Cottage in those post-war years and how that crush developed into the passionate affair that rocked the monarchy. Quite when the spark was lit is unknown. It wasn't until after the Townsends divorced in 1952 - and a famous moment during the Queen's Coronation the following year when Margaret was seen tenderly removing a piece of fluff from Townsend's lapel - that the affair would become public knowledge. But it is now widely believed it began years earlier, during that time when the two sisters were occasional visitors to Adelaide Cottage - a time when, significantly, Townsend was never far from the Royal Family in his work for the King. It was a three-month State tour of South Africa, from February 1947 - on which the two princesses accompanied the King and Queen - that pitched Townsend, 32, and Margaret, then nearly 17, into near-constant company. Part of the equerry's role was to chaperone the teenager - the two were in each other's company every day, riding out and taking in the sights. She would later tell a confidante: 'We rode together every morning in that wonderful country, in marvellous weather. That's when I really fell in love with him.' In 2017 Daily Mail columnist Craig Brown revealed how a reader of his book about Margaret -- Ma'am Darling: 99 Glimpses Of Princess Margaret - had unearthed fresh information which some might view as startling. What it suggested was that the affair began years earlier than is popularly accepted. Indeed, it seems that when the Princess launched the ship the Edinburgh Castle on October 16, 1947, she was already in a relationship with Townsend, who was then 32 and the father of two young sons. While there is no proof they were intimate at that stage, the reader had uncovered notes among official paper showing that on the visit to the shipyard, on which Townsend accompanied her, a request was made for them to have adjoining bedrooms at Hillsborough Castle, the then governor's official residence in Belfast. Was this request spurred on by an intimacy already established at Adelaide Cottage? Further evidence of the closeness of the pair when Townsend lived in the Windsor house came in Sarah Bradford's 2002 biography of the Queen. She recounted how courtiers noticed Townsend spending more time with Margaret as his marriage faltered. One courtier recalled being at the cottage for the birthday party of one of the Townsend children. 'The telephone rang and it was someone saying 'would Peter go riding with Princess Margaret?' He was not on duty. And he went.' Townsend and his family quit Adelaide Cottage in 1952, when he divorced Rosemary. The affair, however, would be doomed by the Royal Marriages Act which stated no member of the Royal Family was permitted to marry a divorcee while the ex-partner was still living. On October 31, 1955, the Princess announced she and Townsend would not marry. Since then the cottage has been home to a host of well-connected dignitaries and courtiers, including most recently Simon Rhodes, son of the Queen's cousin and best friend Margaret Rhodes, who died in 2016. But for the most part, Adelaide Cottage had sunk back into its backdrop under the shadow of Windsor Castle's grey walls. Will it now be thrust into the spotlight again?",
  "4d2db91adb247ed54c4c5aa40818d2af0a0b27c44846ace308d87986": "A man has been jailed after being caught by his then partner reading a 648-page digital handbook on child exploitation titled 'The Paedophile's Handbook'. Darwin resident Jayden Trevitt, 30, was sentenced to nine months behind bars after pleading guilty at the Northern Territory Supreme Court last week to charges of accessing and possessing child abuse material. Trevitt was caught by his then-fiancee viewing the catalogue of disturbing images and text in the middle of the night, which included parts titled: 'how to find and groom children', 'how to avoid detection of that sort of activity' and 'how to get children to keep offending behaviours secret'. He was caught accessing the sickening document by his fiance when she awoke at 2am on August 22 last year. Upon seeing her partner was not in bed, she walked into the study and found him using his gaming computer. Trevitt was wearing headphones at the time so he did not hear her enter. The woman watched Trevitt accessing the child abuse materials and walked back to her bedroom to get her mobile phone and used it to record five videos of him viewing the disturbing content. He was using a web browser specifically used to access the Dark Web and protect his identity. She returned to bed and the following morning reported him to police, who discovered a 'broad and disturbing range' of child abuse material that had been access over two days in August, 2021. Officers from the Joint Anti-Child Exploitation Team attended his residence and seized his black gaming computer which he had been using in the sessions recorded by his fiance. They also seized two encrypted USBs, an iPhone and another laptop. Chief Justice Michael Grant said Trevitt failed to show he was 'genuinely remorseful' and his behaviour was 'loathsome' and 'perverse'. 'In assessing the gravity of your offending and the appropriate sentence, I must necessarily take into account the fact that children have been grievously harmed in both a physical and a psychological sense to satisfy the loathsome, base and perverse desires of people like you.  'Those children are vulnerable and they are not in a position to protect themselves. You engaged in that offending despite the fact that you must necessarily have known each and every time you viewed an image or a video that the children depicted in them were being subject to exploitation and abuse.  'Your barrister suggests in submissions that you did not consider at the time that you were hurting anyone, but I do not accept that to be so.' Justice Grant sentenced Trevitt to an 18-month sentence, with nine months to be served in jail and nine months serving the community. He will have to forfeit his electronic devices and will be on a good behaviour bond for two years following his release from prison.  'I must necessarily take into account the fact that children have been grievously harmed in both a physical and a psychological sense to satisfy the loathsome, base and perverse desires of people like you,' Justice Grant said. 'There is no direct evidence before me to suggest that you have acknowledged, or that you are genuinely remorseful for, the fact that you have been part of creating demand for material of this kind, and in doing so have contributed to the suffering of many children.'

  "09ced6cc8f05d329fbf8a1e2f287562d958054c2eb3f6d191b91b1d0": "A man who recently admitted murdering an American mathematician found at the bottom of a Sydney cliff 34 years ago in a gay hate crime has come out as gay himself, a court has heard.  Scott Phillip White, 51, was jailed for a maximum of 12 years and seven months on Tuesday over the murder of Scott Johnson, 27, whose naked body was found at the bottom of a cliff on Sydney's northern beaches in December 1988. White will be eligible for parole in eight years in August 2030.   For more than three decades, Mr Johnson's death was dismissed by police as suicide before White was charged with murder in 2020 after a lengthy campaign by his loved ones and the media.  White had previously indicated he would plead not guilty before changing his plea at a pre-trial hearing in January. He showed no emotion in the court dock as Justice Helen Wilson handed down his sentence on Tuesday. Justice Wilson found that he had punched Mr Johnson at North Head in a hostile act, causing the doctor to fall to his death. '[White] did a violent act and that act is the direct cause of Dr Johnson leaving the clifftop in terror,' the judge said. The fatal assault was done with reckless indifference to human life, with White throwing the punch near the unguarded edge of a high coastal cliff and then fleeing the scene without notifying the police after Dr Johnson disappeared over the edge. Justice Wilson found there was not enough evidence 'beyond reasonable doubt' to show the murder was a gay hate crime, however, because White had met Dr Johnson at the Brighton Hotel and the pair had willingly gone to the gay beat together. Justice Wilson acknowledged the outcome would 'unlikely to end the grief ... it may bring some peace' for Dr Johnson's grieving family, who have spent the last 34 years fighting for justice. 'It was a terrible death ... Mr Johnson must have been terrified, aware he would strike the rocks below and conscious of his fate,' she said.  Justice Wilson found the attack was not planned and could have been driven by 'self-loathing'. White was raised in a homophobic family before he came out as gay years later, the sentencing process revealed this week.  White, was facing life behind bars but received a reduced sentence based on his recent guilty plea, cognitive impairment and a dysfunctional upbringing.   Originally from Los Angeles, Dr Johnson had been a doctoral student at the Australian National University in Canberra when he met White at a Manly hotel before the pair went to North Head. At a hearing on Monday, White barrister's Belinda Rigg SC argued her client should receive a lesser sentence because he had only turned 18 at the time, saying that sentences for murder were significantly lower in the late 1980s and early 1990s. White's intellectual impairments meant he had suffered stress, anxiety and panic attacks while in custody.  During the 1980s, White was a gay man who had lived with his homophobic brother and alcoholic parents, Ms Rigg said. She also told the court White now identified as gay and had told police he went, at Mr Johnson's suggestion, to North Head on the night of his death. It comes as Mr Johnson's shattered family spoke of the horror, terror, tragedy and heartbreak that the past 34 years have brought. Sister Terry Johnson said Scott White had taken away decades from her brother's life. 'The hateful person who killed Scott has been walking free on this earth for the past 33 years. Thirty-three years that he took away from my baby brother. I believe [White] deserves life in prison.' Another sister Rebecca Johnson talked about how society in the 1980s had also let down teenagers who thought violence against gay men was acceptable. 'Parents, brothers and sisters, teachers and classmates, authority, culture, somehow Mr White's world reinforced that violence and even killing was OK and maybe that gay men weren't human. That is a profound tragedy,' she said on Monday. Brother Steve Johnson described the death as too awful to be true, saying his mother had reacted with a wailing cry at the news. 'The wailing is a reliving, it's a howl of death and despair and loss and grief that signifies that a piece of us has departed. It never goes away.' Dr Johnson's partner Michael Noone also gave a statement describing the sheer horror of receiving a call from the police about the death of a loved one. The victim statements were heard after White's former partner Helen White took the stand and described a conversation with him in December 1998 about his 'poofter bashing' of the 1980s. 'He said the only good poofter is a dead poofter, to which I said, 'So you threw him off the cliff'. And he said, 'It's not my fault the dumb c*** ran off the cliff',' she said. Ms White denied suggestions by White's barrister that she had only gone to police because of a $1 million reward offered in 2018 for information about Mr Johnson's death, and rejected claims she had made up the conversations with her then husband. The prosecution pointed to the seriousness of the offence, saying it was targeted towards the victim's sexuality. 'This was a grave and serious murder which entailed a high degree of criminality,' crown prosecutor Brett Hatfield said. Speaking after Monday's hearing, Steve Johnson said that while giving their statements in court was emotional for the family, it was a chance to look White right in the eyes. 'I got to tell [White] what my brother was like. I got to tell him how it felt to hear that he was dead ... I have to think it sunk in. He watched and listened.' White's defence team unsuccessfully tried to reverse the guilty plea the day it was made.  An appeal of White's conviction was filed last month and could be heard Court of Criminal Appeal 'towards the end of this year', Justice Wilson said. While the initial police inquest in 1989 found Mr Johnson's death was a suicide, the case was reopened in 2012.  Another inquest returned an open finding in June 2012, but a third in 2017 found Mr Johnson fell from the clifftops as a result of violence by an unidentified attacker who perceived him to be gay.",

Salimah Elizabeth Ainsworth, 39, from Western Australia is accused of pulling the boy from the bath - after the older son refused the order - and holding his nose until he passed out.  The three-year-old was later allegedly locked outside of the house naked for hours until neighbours heard the boy screaming and called police on September 30, 2021.  Ms Ainsworth appeared in Kalgoorlie Magistrates Court in November via video-link from her jail cell before being granted bail to reside in York - a small town two hours outside Perth.  On Monday she pleaded not guilty in the same court to one charge of doing an act with intent to cause harm which endangered another, reports the Kalgoorlie Miner.  Ms Ainsworth previously apologised in court for the 'horrible' events and claimed they were the result of marijuana-induced psychosis.  The court heard allegations that on September 30 she woke her 13-year-old older son at their Kambalda West residence and told him to 'wash' the toddler. She then allegedly tried to 'cleanse' the boy by putting him in the shower and bath before leaving him alone, turning the lights off and shutting the door - telling the older boy he was a 'devil child' and would be reborn. The young brother hit his head on the bath while Ms Ainsworth was allegedly trying to force him in, before telling the older brother to drown him. When he refused, she allegedly held the boy's nose until he passed out then ordered the brother to take him to his father's house 200m away, police claim.  The father was not at home and when the boys returned, she allegedly would not let in the younger son. Three hours later, neighbours confronted Ms Ainsworth after allegedly hearing the child screaming and called police.  Ms Ainsworth will reappear in court in July when a trial at the District Court will be scheduled. ",

Jake Gray initially saw the spider a year ago inside his Cairns home in Far North Queensland, only to find it had grown to a monstrous size 12 months later.  The spider is reportedly named Charlotte, and loves going from room to room eating bugs.  'Check out this big girl... the mighty huntsman,' he wrote. While Mr Gray seemed to be coping with the arachnid living on his property, other social media commenters were not as excited about the size of the spider.  'Is this a jungle?' One woman said. 'Bruh that's the spider's house now, make sure they have a copy of the deed,' another person wrote.  One person wrote: 'I'd have to move house and buy new stuff. It's all charlottes now.' Another commented: 'I will never visit Australia. You could not pay me enough money to visit that god forsaken land.'  'When people ask me why I left Australia... this. This is why. You don't know real fear till you wake up at 4am in the morning and one of these dudes is staring at you from your ceiling,' another said. 'It's going to have to start paying rent soon and contribute to the upkeep,' one user commented. Fellow Queenslanders shared their own stories about finding scary spiders in unfortunate places, with one woman finding a banded huntsman in her car. 'A few years ago while driving to school on the Gold Coast, my son in the backseat said to his brother in the front 'what's that behind your head?',' one woman wrote. 'I looked and stopped the car and we all got out screaming. 'I picked up the spider with my daughter's blanket and threw it onto the grass.' Another woman said she was driving in her car when she spotted a menacing shadow crawling across the window. 'I nearly crashed, the poor guys at the produce place had to get it out for me,' she wrote. 'It's the biggest one I've ever seen.' One Queensland woman walked into her laundry to use the bathroom but found two huntsman near the toilet. 'They gave me a heart attack and forced me to go and pee on the back lawn,' she said. 'Luckily it was late at night! I hate spiders.'  There are more than 155 different species of huntsman in Australia.  They are large, long-legged spiders and are mostly coloured grey and brown with banded legs.  Huntsman spiders are large, long-legged spiders. They are mostly grey to brown, sometimes with banded legs. They are commonly found living under loose bark on trees, in crevices on rock walls and in logs, under rocks and slabs of bark on the ground, and on foliage. Many huntsman spiders have rather flattened bodies adapted for living in narrow spaces under loose bark or rock crevices. This is aided by their legs which, instead of bending vertically in relation to the body, have the joints twisted so that they spread out forwards and laterally in crab-like fashion. Huntsman spiders of many species sometimes enter houses. They are also notorious for entering cars, and being found hiding behind sun visors or running across the dashboard.

  "0091dd89af4a40ca8184494e22c976ac93a9680c83fe93684dbf0ce0": "Annastacia Palaszczuk has  apologised for bringing her boyfriend to an important meeting with the International Olympic Committee. The Queensland Premier made her apology during a press conference on Tuesday where she explained that the attendance of her surgeon boyfriend Reza Adib at the meeting in Sydney was simply 'a mistake'. Ms Palaszczuk brought Dr Adib along to the meeting at the Sofitel Hotel in Sydney on Sunday. IOC president Thomas Bach, outgoing and new AOC presidents John Coates and Ian Chesterman, Brisbane Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner, and the head of the Brisbane 2032 organising committee, Andrew Liveris, were all in attendance. 'Now, I appreciate that there have been views expressed about this catch up,' the Premier told reporters at a doorstop on Tuesday. 'I recognise that I have made a mistake and I should not have taken my partner to that meeting. I apologise, it was never intentional to cause any distress to anybody.' Ms Palaszczuk stressed that the meeting was only an 'informal catch-up' with officials. When reporters questioned the Premier further on Dr Adib's attendance, she apologised again. 'Look, I invited him and I made a mistake and I apologise for that. I made a mistake, so I'm sorry,' she responded. Ms Palaszczuk told the media that no one at the meeting questioned Dr Adib's appearance and explained that the couple and officials were 'all in town there' and 'got together on a Sunday'. She followed up by assuring the media that Dr Adib made 'no contributions' during the meeting before apologising for a third time.  'It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened. I can't undo what has happened. All I can do is apologise, and I sincerely do that.'  The Premier faced backlash over the weekend after Dr Adib was seen in images with key Olympics officials that were taken on Sunday at the meeting. Questions were raised as to why Dr Adib tagged along in the first place, with the Deputy Opposition Leader Jarrod Bleijie describing the scenario as 'weird' and 'not appropriate'. 'I've just got to say, it's just a bit weird, the whole thing is weird,' Mr Bleijie said on Monday at a press conference. 'No one else had their partners at the meeting.' 'It was a properly-prepared, formal meeting with very important people and the Premier's boyfriend was at the table.' 'So I'm just saying, I looked at it, and I just think, why was the Premier's boyfriend granted a position at the table? He shouldn't have been there.' The Courier Mail has revealed that Dr Adib's name was not included on an official attendee list for the meeting. Sunday's meeting saw an official slogan for the Games unveiled, which was agreed upon between officials. IOC President Thomas Bach told the press the slogan was 'Have a go!' The meeting also publicly farewelled long-serving AOC President, John Coates. News of the Queensland Premier's relationship with Mr Adib was only revealed last year. Ms Palaszczuk confirmed the relationship with The Courier-Mail in September, describing him as a 'very warm and caring, intelligent man with a great sense of humour'. Political sources said the pair's relationship had only blossomed in the preceding months.",

He knows the holes in his leaky Beergate narrative are growing but thinks he may still save himself from going under if he can keep plugging them. By his constant dissembling, the Labour leader, who loves to castigate Boris Johnson over alleged lockdown breaches, has shown himself to be the worst kind of hypocrite. He presents himself as some sort of Honest John who can be trusted to run the country. Yet in truth he's as slippery as a snake-oil salesman. Every incriminating fact about the Durham beer and takeaway party he and his activists enjoyed in defiance of lockdown has had to be dragged out of him. Even now we have only a fraction of the whole story. How many attended? Was it six or seven as Sir Keir implied in January, or around 30 as the curry delivery driver told the Daily Mail two days ago? Why did Sir Keir and his team deny that deputy leader Angela Rayner was there until video evidence shamed them into admitting she was? Was it because the gathering might have seemed too much like a party? And, crucially, is it really plausible the bash was merely a 'pause' in a busy day, as he claims? Sir Keir asks us to believe that following an arduous day on the election campaign trail, a full meal and boozing until after 10pm, he and his chums went straight back to work? Pull the other one! As Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries put it yesterday: 'No reasonable person believes Labour's story. So why do Durham police?' One may sympathise with Chief Constable Jo Farrell here. Her police and crime commissioner is Labour, as is the constituency MP and just about every other local official with any authority. The line of least resistance for her is to do nothing. But she is paid to carry out her duties without fear or favour. There is prima facie evidence of lockdown breaches similar to those investigated by the Metropolitan Police in Downing Street. As long as she fails to investigate, it looks like a clear case of double standards. If Sir Keir has nothing to hide, he should encourage the police to step in and clear his name. Or is he afraid the dyke may burst, and the flood waters sweep away his credibility for good? GPs on the brink An average of just one GP per 2,200 patients - one per 3,000 in some areas. More than a third of practices so overwhelmed that they have stopped taking routine appointments. Already under strain before the pandemic, our GP system is in real danger of collapse. Instead of sniping at each other, politicians, the NHS and medical unions must work together to recruit more doctors and radically improve working practices. Without urgent remedial action, the traditional family surgery may soon become a thing of the past.

  "2ca6f28feea1278bfeaecf68493fafdb181b55de19762d0d6cca99d4": "Johnny Depp was set to earn an impressive $22.5million for his role in the sixth installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise before being dropped from the film following allegations of domestic violence.  The actor's agent Jack Whigham testified in Depp's defamation trial against ex-wife Amber Heard Monday, telling the court the actress's 2018 op-ed was 'catastrophic' for his career.  Whigham noted that Heard's piece, published in the Washington Post in December 2018, was 'rather shocking because it was the first time I'd heard an allegation of sexual abuse.'  Depp, 58, is suing Heard for $50million, claiming she defamed him and destroyed his career after she wrote about being a survivor of domestic violence in the piece.  The article did not mention Depp by name, but his lawyers say it was clear Heard, 36, was referencing the Hollywood leading man.  Testifying live via video link, Whigham described the negative impact and damage the piece had on Depp's reputation as a Hollywood star. 'With respect to Johnny, it was catastrophic because it was coming from a first person account, it was not from a journalist, not someone observing, it was from someone saying this happened to me,' the agent said. In the two years after the op-ed was publication, between December 2018 and October 2020, Depp appeared in 'zero' studio films, Whigham told the court. He said the actor scored a $22.5million deal with Disney to reprise his role as Captain Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean 6 but in 2019 learned the studio would not be casting him in the new installment.   Disney instead decided it was going in a 'different direction', Whigham said, and was looking to develop a 'Pirates project' for actress Margot Robbie instead of featuring Depp. The movie is yet to be made. Whigham noted that even when Depp was cast in the independent drama, Minimata, the movie struggled after the article came out. Whigham said: 'The op-ed came out in December right as we were going on Christmas break.  'Minimata was supposed to start (shooting) in January. It was very, very difficult to keep Minimata together. 'The financing became shaky, Johnny's fee came down in order to save the movie,' the agent added.  Whigham said after the op-ed 'it was impossible to get him a studio film which is what we would have normally been focused on.' During Whigham's testimony the court heard about how much Depp earned for other movies. For City of Lies, the 2018 movie about the investigations into the deaths of rappers Biggie Smalls and Tupac Shakur, Depp earned $8million. Depp was paid $10million for the 2017 murder mystery Murder on the Orient Express. For Fantastic Beasts 2 - Crimes of Grindelwald, the spin-off from the Harry Potter films which came out in 2018 and starred Depp in the lead role as Gellert Grindelwald, he was paid $13.5million. Depp earned $3.5million for the 2018 comedy drama The Professor and $1million for Waiting for the Barbarians, the 2019 adaptation of the J. M. Coetzee novel. Depp earned $3million for Minimata, which came out in 2020, Whigham told the court. That means Depp earned a total of $38million between 2017 and 2020 for his acting. During cross-examination, Heard's attorney Elaine Bredehoft questioned Whigham's claims that the lucrative contract between Depp and Disney for the new film was a done deal.  'Do you have an explanation why there is not even a piece of paper ... nothing that suggested Mr. Depp is going to be in Pirates 6 as Jack Sparrow?' she asked.    Whigham replied: 'We would work on many deals where you wouldn't see a contract, they would be a verbal agreement.'  The latest testimony helps support Depp's claims that his long-running career in Hollywood suffered as a result of Heard's op-ed.  Richard Marks, an entertainment lawyer who has worked in Hollywood for decades, also told the jury about his assessment of the impact of Heard's op-ed on Depp's career. Marks, testifying as an expert in the entertainment industry, said: 'The op-ed damaged Mr. Depp, created a cancel situation if you will, harmed his reputation and ability to get work in the Hollywood industry' Marks said that studios 'wouldn't want to hire an actor who has negativity following them, you wouldn't want to pay to bring your brand down'. He said: 'That's very important and especially in the last five years of MeToo movement, you wouldn't want negativity, hiring an actor who 'had been canceled'. Asked what in particular might stop an actor getting hired, he said: 'We're talking illegal activity, criminal record but right now the pinnacle of negativity in Hollywood is being accused of domestic abuse, domestic violence.  'We've seen, almost immediately, terminations and cancelations for the investors to move away from that negativity'. Marks said that the op-ed was so impactful because it was in the Washington Post, which he called a 'flagship journal of American news'. He said: 'We're not talking about a trade paper. It is geared to Hollywood. It says two years ago when I was getting my divorce, Amber Heard is saying, I was abused, Hollywood stood up for my abuser, not me the victim. Hollywood got the subject matter of the op-ed loud and clear 'Amber Heard was calling out Hollywood for supporting since 2016 her abuser and she felt the wrath of Hollywood. She was calling them out to do something and on the eve of her biggest film, a big film for Hollywood. The publicity machine was in high gear. This was the height of her fame and she used it to call Hollywood out and they heard that plea loud and clear. It also got her publicity for her movie - it wasn't a coincidence that date. In Hollywood the message was received that she was sending'. Marks dismissed Depp's reputation for lateness on sets saying that Hollywood has 'always had divas like Marilyn Monroe who stay in her trailer for half a day'. He said that the impact of the op-ed on Depp's reputation was 'devastating.' He said: 'It's the type of claim, the MeToo claim, that has canceled a list of actors. Chris Noth recently, Frank Langella, newscasters, Les Moonves, now Johnny Depp is in their ranks. It's devastating'. Marks said that the effect of MeToo in Hollywood was that the 'morals clause' in actors' contracts was returning so they could act 'decisively' in the event of these kind of allegations. Marks said that he was working with Kevin Spacey when he was accused of sexual misconduct and he was cut out of a film about the Getty family and the House of Cards series was 'redone to get rid of the notion Hollywood would support an abuser'. At one point Depp laughed and jokingly appeared to take offense as negative headlines about him were read out to the court. The actor snickered as Heard's lawyer Adam Nadelhaft read out one article which said he had a 'run of movie flops'. Asked about the article Marks defended Depp and said: 'Every actor has ups and downs, Mr Depp has had a career that's decades long.' Nadelhaft read out another article which read that 'Mr Depp is on his way to becoming the most overpaid actor in Hollywood'. Marks dismissed the piece as being written by a 'smartypants'. To another article which said that 'Johnny Depp has become Hollywood's biggest joke', Marks said that 'Netflix is a joke'. Depp appeared amused as the headlines were read, flexing his eyebrows as if mulling them over and smiling. Marks became sarcastic when asked about how the Washington Post op-ed didn't even name Depp. He told Nadelhaft: 'Does she (Heard) have another husband who abused her?' Asked about the 2020 libel trial in London - where a judge ruled the claim Depp was a wife beater was 'substantially true' - Marks issued another dry response. He said: 'We thought we got rid of the UK in 1776 but we're still following it'. Later in the trial Monday, the court heard from Douglas Bania, an intellectual property analyst who assessed the damage to Depp's reputation through analyzing online articles written about him. Bania said that before Heards's allegations of domestic violence in 2016, the most popular Google search results for Depp were about his career and his characters. After 2016 the 'majority of those results turned negative' and after the op-ed came out in 2018 they focused on not just the allegations but Depp's drinking and drug use, Bania said. Bania also looked at Depp's Q Score, which is a method used to assess how popular public figures and celebrities are. According to Bania, after Heard made her allegations his positive Q score went down from 35 to 29. His negative Q score went from 11 to 15, meaning more people disliked him. Bania said: 'The public perception of Mr Depp has been damaged. 'They like him less and they dislike him more.'  During the testimony of Erin Falati, Heard's former nurse, the court was shown texts and nursing notes that gave insight into her mental unrest. In March 2015, after Heard returned from the incident in Australia, Falati texted Whitney Heard, Heard's sister, checking if she was OK. Falati wrote: 'Thank goodness she must be exhausted. You want me to come to the loft or is she safe and sound asleep?' Whitney replied: 'Safe? No she is not, kept saying she wants to kill herself.'  In her nursing notes from November that year, Falati wrote that Heard had been 'experiencing increased anxiety' with 'several outbursts of anger and rage' Falati told the court that she was there to 'in layman's terms, calm things down a bit.'  She recalled one incident in London in 2014 when Heard was 'very angry' because she thought her phone had been hacked. In a note in her nursing log on December 17, 2015, Falati described how Heard was 'weepy and sad' and 'slouched' after a row with Depp. Heard had a 'visible bright red blood appearing at the center of lower lip' that was 'actively bleeding.'  The notes stated that Heard's 'head is bruised and she lost clumps of hair in altercation' - she was advised to get it checked out. In a note in the nursing log from May 26, 2016, after the divorce was filed, Falati said Heard felt it was the 'hardest' time of her life and that she 'can't deal with the negative publicity.'  The court was also shown photos Heard had sent to the nurse days earlier that showed the actress with red marks on her face. Falati told the court there was reddening of the skin on Heard but said she was not an expert.   Judge Penney Azcarate called an early end to Monday's proceedings before Falati could finish her testimony and be questioned by Depp's lawyers.  The trial will resume Tuesday morning at 10am.   Meanwhile, legions of fans have come to Depp's defense after hearing his testimony last week, with a petition calling for his ex-wife to be axed from upcoming sequel Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom  reaching three million signatures Monday.  Supporters of the actor are pleading with filmmakers DC and Warner Bros to ditch the actress from the sequel, Aquaman 2, which is due to be released next March. Heard starred as Mera in the original film in 2018 alongside Jason Momoa and Nicole Kidman. Critics believe she should suffer the same fate Depp did when he was dropped by Disney in his role as Captain Jack Sparrow in the sixth installment of Pirates of the Caribbean - after Heard's op-ed.  'I will not be going to view Aquaman 2 movie if Amber is playing the role,' one fan tweeted. 'I love Jason Momoa, I can't support a project that fires the victim and kept the abuser in their films.'  Another said: 'I don't care if Amber Heard's Aquaman 2 screen time is reduced to 10min. I won't watch it until they reduce it to 0.' Heard is countersuing for $100million. Up until now she has watched on as the actor has made multiple allegations about her alleged behavior during their tumultuous relationship. If the petition, which is already rapidly rising, reaches 4,500,000 signatures it will become one of the top signed on Charge.org.  It states: 'Amber Heard has been exposed as a domestic abuser by Johnny Depp.  'In his lawsuit, Johnny Depp describes many incidents of domestic abuse that he suffered at the hands of his (then) wife Amber Heard, including one incident where she punched him twice in the face and another where she shattered his finger with a vodka bottle, and his finger had to be surgically reattached.   'He will bear the scar from that for the rest of his life.' It continues: 'Men are victims of domestic abuse, just like women. This must be recognized, and action must be taken to prevent a known abuser from being celebrated within the entertainment industry.  'Do the right thing. Remove Amber Heard from Aquaman 2.'  The A-list trial in Virginia, started on April 11 and is set to last another three weeks.",
  "0df2d6e2276791c212b065e923b93300b2173bf8f35cff8852d49acd": "Melissa Caddick's DJ husband has been kicked out of his wife's $15million mansion, the Federal Court ordered. On Tuesday morning, Justice Brigitte Markovic told Anthony Koletti to vacate the multi million-dollar home in Dover Heights, in Sydney's eastern suburbs, by May 18. 'Anthony Koletti is to be granted liberty to apply on two days' written notice in respect of any dispute regarding the removal of personal property items from the Dover Heights property,' Justice Markovic said.  The property will be sold by liquidators in an attempt to try and repay some of the $23million Caddick stole from investors in her Ponzi scheme - which largely comprised close friends and family. Caddick posed as a financial advisor and told her 74 victims that she was investing their life savings in well-performing shares - fudging CommSec statements to trick them into believing they were accumulating wealth. However, Caddick didn't invest anything on her clients' behalf - instead, she used investor money to fund her lavish lifestyle, which included luxury holidays, designer jewellery, clothes, cars, and a fine art collection. Her scheme fell apart when the Australian Investment and Securities Commission and the Australian Federal Police raided her home in November 2020. She mysteriously vanished the next day and wasn't seen or heard from again until March the following year when her severed foot washed up on a South Coast beach - 400km away from the Dover Heights mansion. Caddick was presumed dead, but there will be a formal inquest in September. Mr Koletti fought to keep some of the assets his wife bought with stolen funds - claiming only two weeks ago that he contributed financially to the household between 2017 and 2020. In mid-April, the one-time DJ submitted a statement to the Federal Court claiming he was a homemaker and cared for his Caddick's teenage son - which meant he should be given Caddick's art collection, diamond jewellery, and her Gucci wedding dress. He has also tried to get a cut of the sale of the $15million house, along with the $4million three-bedroom unit in Edgecliff - which Caddick bought for her elderly parents. In February, Mr Koletti told the Federal Court that he saw 'no purpose' in receivers having access to the Dover Heights home. 'I need all the money that I can get,' he said. After claiming he was too busy to let a court-appointed insolvency group inside the property, he said he was 'trying to support a young child.' Caddick's teenage son, who she had with her first husband, is understood to be living at the property with Mr Koletti.  The court previously heard that Mr Koletti had $1.95 in his bank account when Caddick vanished in November 2020 - the day after the home was raided by Australian Federal Police.  Steven Golledge, SC, who is representing Bruce Gleeson and Daniel Soire from insolvency firm Jones Partners, told the court that Mr Koletti objected to the sale of the house, but that he did not provide any evidence to support his claim. Mr Koletti also objected to the sale of his Audi R8 convertible sports car, but again he failed to give liquidators any proof that he contributed to the $390,000 purchase in 2016. The car sold for $295,000 in February, while Caddick's black 2016 Mercedes-Benz CLA45 was auctioned for $66,250.",
  "6be3a8f7fab15774a3d5224d9e7b353db1becfa40d6ee39e37c07da5": "A female teacher has been arrested and accused of sexually abusing a teenage school student. Azar Rahmatzadeh, 44, from Melbourne's Wantirna College, a public school, was charged with sexual penetration of a child under 16, sexual assault and one charge of supplying liquor to a minor. The Herald Sun reported that police launched an investigation into the Ms Rahmatzadeh after she allegedly sent texts to a male student calling him 'handsome'. Rahmatzadeh was granted bail on Monday after a brief appearance before Melbourne's Magistrates' Court. In the Facebook message, Rahmatzadeh allegedly complains that the student deleted her from the social media app. 'I wasn't mad and it didn't mean I didn't like you or didn't want to talk to you or see you anymore, I also noticed that day that you removed me as a friend on Facebook,' the message from the teacher allegedly said. 'I'm just stupid sometimes, I don't think and make stupid decisions (I'll stop drinking!!) but please know I still think the world of you and hope reading this makes you hate me less and one day, in time, we can be mates again. 'I'm truly sorry if I hurt you. F**king love your guts forever xxx.' Another text exchange allegedly discusses when Rahmatzadeh will send a photo of herself in a bikini, to which she allegedly says when the student is 18. Wantirna College Principal Kevin Murphy told parents in a letter the teacher would not be returning to school grounds while the case continues. 'We were very concerned to learn of this and I assure you our number one priority is always the safety and wellbeing of our students,' he said.  Rahmatzadeh will appear in court again on July 29. ",
  "810e127aa3f4f956c2a15037a60948498142cbb2f69d8db23c193a16": "Grieving families are furious after a local council laid down 'dangerous' gravestones for health and safety reasons so they do not 'topple over' and hurt someone - and told relatives they will have to pay to have them repaired.  Council officials in Weymouth, Dorset, have removed 21 headstones from the ground and left them lying in a cemetery citing the safety of visitors to the graveyard. But families have described the council's actions as 'upsetting and unacceptable' and one woman has said the headstones will be left on the ground permanently unless the families foot an estimated PS150 bill to have them re-erected. Lynn Lewis says she was not informed of the council's plans to remove the headstone of her late father Les and only discovered it had been pulled out when she visited Weymouth Cemetery to pay her respects on his birthday. Les died in 2019 and was buries alongside his father Ernest, who passed away in 1986, with both men commemorated on the gravestone.  Ms Lewis said: 'It's all upsetting and I am just flabbergasted by it, surely they could communicate this was happening or let us know beforehand? 'I just feel it is unacceptable not to contact us prior to removal or even to put a note up is just upsetting. 'My dad passed away in January 2019 so it is still fresh in our mind - it is just awful.   'It's up to us to put it up and pay the costs. They just remove them and leave them there. 'For a stonemason (to put it up) you are looking at PS150. It's totally unfair. The whole thing has baffled me - it's just awful.' Weymouth Town Council has defended its actions, stating it has a duty to carry out memorial inspections at least once every five years and, following its most recent assessments, 21 were deemed to be unsafe. The local authority also said it had attempted to warn all families prior to the removals. Of the 21 headstones, 12 owners were deceased, six no longer live at the addresses the council has on record and three were contacted via letter, including the family of Les Lewis. A spokesperson for the council said: 'We would like to apologise to the family for any distress this incident has caused. 'We have a responsibility to maintain our cemeteries in the town in the best way possible for all visitors, and as part of this work we do carry out regular safety checks. 'When staff carried out inspections at Weymouth Cemetery, this memorial was found to be very loose and action was taken to make it safe. 'The headstone was lowered onto the grave to ensure that it could not topple over and hurt any visitors to the cemetery. 'If we have had to lay down any headstones, we then inform people about this. Apologies again for any distress this has caused.'",
  "424a6050bb202ea4acad5686b40e7db4e840c5ed7cd49df2270dd06e": "Mystery surrounds the disappearance of a much-loved Kiwi camera operator who has vanished without a trace in the UK, as his frantic fiancee recalled the final text he sent her - saying he would pull down the blinds before bed, but never did. Family and friends hold grave concerns for Joseph Day, 31, who was last seen on Saturday night and hasn't responded to phone calls or texts in the 48 hours since. The former TVNZ camera operator's last known whereabouts were in the upmarket Clifton area of Bristol, where he lived with his partner of five years Kelsey Mulcahy. She was spending the night with friends two-and-a half hours away in London and had been texting her fiance back and forth - with the last being a regular chat about blinds in their home - until he suddenly stopped replying around 8.45pm local time. The couple were new to the Clifton area and had been looking forward to a day trip to Bath Spa on Monday, which was a public holiday in the UK. Friends have travelled from London to join the desperate search as Ms Mulcahy launched a public appeal, which has been widely shared on both sides of the world. The couple's distraught parents are on the way to the UK from New Zealand to help in the search. Ms Mulcahy believes her fiance left their Pembroke Road flat on foot as his bike remains untouched. His keys, wallet and phone remain missing.  The couple had just bought tickets to see Chris Rock in London in a few weeks time and were planning to return home to New Zealand at the end of the year to get married. 'This is extremely out of character for him, we always keep in touch every minute of the day. Everyone who knows Joe loves him very much, he is incredibly special to me, and his family and friends,' Ms Mulcahy posted. 'If you have any information at all, if you've seen him anywhere, please reach out and let me or the Avon and Somerset police know.'   Mr Day had been been taking a break from the media and was working as a builder in the UK.  His fiancee recalled the last text message from him on Saturday after reminding him to pull down the blackout blinds. 'His reply was 'will do' and then he stopped responding but before that we were talking about how we were going to go to London in three weeks,' Ms Mulcahy told Nine Newspapers. 'We just adore each other, we have not had problems in our relationship and I would be truly honest if we did.' Ms Mulcahy's worst fears were realised when she returned home on Sunday afternoon to find the blinds still open and a Hello Fresh grocery box outside. She reported Mr Day's disappearance to Avon and Somerset Police which has since launched a public appeal. 'Something is preventing him from coming back; there's no way he's choosing not to come home to me,' she said.  'His mum hasn't heard from him and he adores his mum.' She told the NZ Herald: 'It's hard because there are so many people that love him in New Zealand, his family and all of his friends adore him - he's just the sweetest, nicest guy ever. 'His plan was to have a really nice night in at home, having the flat to himself.' His sister Olivia Day posted that police now regard her brother's disappearance as high risk and top priority.  'Thank you to every single person who has spread our message around the world. Now we just need good news,' she wrote on Tuesday. Back home in Auckland, former media colleagues have also joined the public appeal for information for Mr Day's whereabouts. 'If anyone's in the UK/Bristol and has seen Joseph - please get in touch with his partner Kelsey,' 1NewsNZ journalist Andrew Macfarlane tweeted.  Josh Tasman-Jones said it was out of character for his best mate to not be in touch with his fiancee for this long. 'Everyone has done everything they can at this stage and we just want to thank everyone for the outpouring of love and support,' Mr Tasman-Jones told TVNZ's Breakfast. Program host Jenny-May Clarkson added everyone was all 'shaken' over the disappearance of their former colleague. Mr Day is described as mixed ethnicity with short dark hair and stubble, around 180cm tall and athletic build and has sleeve tattoos on both forearms. He was last seen wearing black high top Nike trainers, a long black wax jacket and a blue Seattle Mariners baseball cap.",
  "92a52a5e9a3675c7c041fab1a2302816073f0c959911dedee540d65c": "Hillary Clinton on Monday attended her first Met Gala in 21 years, wearing a dress designed to send a powerful message to those who came near her. Clinton, 74, worked with designer Joseph Altuzarra to pay tribute to celebrated women of the past, with 60 of their names sewn into her burgundy strapless gown. Asked for the inspiration, she said she was discussing ideas with the French-American designer and came up with the concept.  'I said, 'What about American women in the past who have inspired me?'' she explained to red carpet interviewers Vanessa Hudgens and Hamish Bowles, Vogue Editor at Large. Clinton said the initial list was excessive, so they limited it to women who were dead, and whittled it down to 60 names. The names of Harriet Tubman, Sacagawea, Eleanor Roosevelt and her mother, Dorothy Rodham, were among those sewn into the hem and neckline - along with Madeleine Albright. She also chose Elizabeth Blackwell, the first woman to get a medical degree in the US, and Clara Barton, who founded the American Red Cross.  Clinton was accompanied by her longtime aide Huma Abedin, in a strapless yellow gown.  Clinton's gown featured a nod to the exhibition accompanying the gala, as it drew inspiration from a piece featured in the exhibit. 'It reflected Joseph's interest in what were called friendship quilts, that women used to embroider sayings, or phrases or the names of families and friends,' Clinton said. Altuzarra told Vogue.com: 'The quilt was an opportunity for women to get together and have this social interaction.  'They were often a kind of memory for women of their community and families, especially if they didn't stay in one place all their life.'  The 39-year-old added: 'I do think America has a very rich and long history of folk craftsmanship, which I thought was a really nice story to allude to.  'People who aren't famous but who would quilt at home and create things for their families.'  Altuzarra, who has previously dressed stars such as Salma Hayek and Evan Rachel Wood for the Met Gala, said he knew that Clinton would draw attention. 'For better or worse, whatever she wears is dissected and analyzed so thoroughly that you have to be very thoughtful about the choices that you make,' Altuzarra said.  'Obviously I was thinking about making her look great, but I was also thinking about the story she's going to be telling through this dress, and how she would actually vocalize that when people ask her about it.  'I wanted that story to be something she felt a personal connection to.' ",
  "14848d08cdcfe96d23f79240c6356eca62dd54d639f0e46f3f2d2d85": "Today's interest rate hike plays right into Anthony Albanese's hands just three weeks out from the election, political analysts say. Back in November Scott Morrison said petrol prices, electricity prices and interest rates would go up under Labor as he styled himself as a superior economic manager. But his argument may be damaged by today's interest rate hike to 0.35 per cent which will whack up mortgage payments for thousands of families - after inflation hit a 21-year high of 5.1 per cent.  The last time interest rates rose during an election campaign came just before fellow Liberal PM John Howard was booted out of office after 11 years in 2007. Even though the RBA sets the rates independently, Mr Howard apologised to the Australian people.    'I don't like it and I would say to the borrowers of Australia who are affected by this change that I am sorry about that, and I regret the additional burden that will be put upon them as a result,' he said. Mr Morrison has dismissed parallels with Mr Howard, pointing out that interest rates were above six per cent in 2007 and before today were at a historic low of 0.1 per cent. He has fairly blamed global supply chains and war in Europe for inflation and insisted that Australia's economy is better placed than comparable wealthy nations. But voters will be experiencing rising grocery bills and now rising mortgage payments when they enter the ballot box on May 21.   Mr Albanese has blasted the Coalition for implementing policies to keep wages low over the past nine years and insists that only he has a plan to deal with cost of living pressures. Labor will make childcare cheaper, make changes to industrial relations laws to push up wages and claims its energy policy will bring power bills down - although this is contested. Mr Morrison's spin doctors say the interest rate rise will help the Coalition by focussing minds on the economic headwinds ahead. The Coalition traditionally sees the economy as its core strength.  But analysts doubt voters feeling the pinch will see it this way.   'This is a full blown cost of living crisis on Scott Morrison's watch and now interest rate hikes are part of the pain,' said shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers. By Stephen Johnson  The Reserve Bank of Australia has raised interest rates for the first time in 11 years to curb soaring inflation - surprising financial markets with a bigger than expected increase. The cash rate has risen by 0.25 percentage points, ending the historic era of a record-low 0.1 per cent cash rate and marking the first increase since November 2010. This was also much bigger than the 0.15 percentage point rise financial markets were expecting, threatening the re-election hopes of Prime Minister Scott Morrison ahead of the May 21 poll. The official rate now stands at 0.35 per cent - the highest since March 2020 at the start of the pandemic - after inflation in the year to March soared by 5.1 per cent - the fastest pace in 21 years. The central bank move is also the first during an election campaign since November 2007, when former Liberal prime minister John Howard lost power. Governor Philip Lowe said:  'The economy has proven to be resilient and inflation has picked up more quickly, and to a higher level, than was expected.' Three of Australia's Big Four banks - ANZ, Westpac and NAB - are expecting the Reserve Bank to take the cash rate to two per cent by 2023 as rates increase seven more times, with more pain possibly coming in June. Dr Lowe is also expecting the era of low wages growth that began in mid-2013 to be over this year, after last year declaring weak pay increases could help the RBA to keep rates on hold until 2024 'at the earliest'. 'There is also evidence that wages growth is picking up,' he said. 'Given this, and the very low level of interest rates, it is appropriate to start the process of normalising monetary conditions.' More than 1.5million borrowers will be coping with a variable increase for the first time as monthly repayments on a typical $600,000 mortgage rise by $78. St George, owned by Westpac, was the first bank to hint at an increase in variable mortgage rates. 'We are currently reviewing our variable interest rates following the RBA's cash rate decision,' it said. 'We will keep you up to date with any changes here.' Last month, the RBA predicted an increase in the cash rate to two per cent - a level unseen since May 2016, would cause a 15 per cent plunge in Australian property prices. CoreLogic research director Tim Lawless is expecting Sydney and Melbourne house prices to dive by 15 per cent in the year ahead, as interest rates keep rising. 'Most of the declines will be concentrated in those two cities because that's where affordability is most stretched and also where, arguably, they'll be facing some demographic headwinds just through interstate migration really favouring the smaller states,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'The counter argument to that is we see overseas borders opening up, we're going to be seeing more migration coming in but that generally tends to flow through to rental demand rather than purchasing demand.' Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart and Canberra, along with regional areas in coastal New South Wales, southern Queensland and northern Tasmania were likely to see smaller declines of five to 10 per cent. 'These markets tend to be a little bit more insulated partly because affordability is not quite as stretched,' Mr Lawless said.  Those markets are more affordable than Sydney and Melbourne and would continue to benefit from professionals who can work from home moving there.  A 15 per cent fall in Sydney's median house price of $1.417million would take values back to $1.204million - where they were in the middle of last year. A drop of the same magnitude in Melbourne would see the mid-point house price drop from $1.001million to $850,787, which would be the lowest level since May 2017. But with unemployment at just 3.95 per cent, the lowest level since 1974, Mr Lawless said forced sales would be unlikely. 'This will probably more a lack of demand and people looking to sell having to adjust their price expectations,' Mr Lawless said.  A 0.25 percentage point increase will see monthly repayments on a typical $600,000 mortgage to climb by $78, from $2,306 to $2,384. That's based on a bank passing on in full the RBA increasing, pushing up a popular variable rate from 2.29 per cent to 2.54 per cent.  $500,000 : Monthly repayments rising by $65 from $1,922 to $1,987 $600,000 : Monthly repayments rising by $78 from $2,306 to $2,384 $700,000 : Monthly repayments rising by $90 from $2,691 to $2,781 $800,000 : Monthly repayments rising by $103 from $3,075 to $3,178 $900,000 : Monthly repayments rising by $116 from $3,459 to $3,575 $1,000,000 : Monthly repayments rising by $130 from $3,843 to $3,973 Data based on variable rate increasing from 2.29 per cent to 2.54 per cent  ",
  "0ff625678fb071b48b81f79d7fbb493dbc0286a45c440024ef005e1f": "A lecturer from one of Australia's top universities accused of murdering his wife had gushed about his family in online posts over recent weeks, saying fatherhood was 'the best journey'. Adam Brown, a senior lecturer in the communications at Deakin University from Croydon North in Melbourne, allegedly stabbed the mother of his children, Chen Cheng, 35, at their home on Saturday evening.  The 40-year-old was charged with murder on Monday - shocking students who thought they were 'hallucinating' when his face popped up on their television screens and newsfeeds.  Brown and Ms Cheng married in China in 2017 and friends and students remarked at 'how in love they seemed'. 'I recognised his face immediately,' one of his students told Daily Mail Australia. 'He was always going on about how once something was online it was there forever. 'I felt like I was hallucinating. He would talk about his wife and the two boys and we'd see snippets of them on his TikTok and Instagram too. 'He was a little bit cringe with his dad jokes but he was likeable too.' As a senior lecturer in the school of Communication and Creative Arts at Deakin, Brown specialised in digital literacy and the evolution of social media.  With upwards of 500 students each semester, he used social media to engage and offer them 'real world experience' about communications in a digital age. On the day of Ms Cheng's alleged murder, Brown was on LinkedIn congratulating a student on her graduation.  He also shared a touching tribute to his late brother, who was best man at his wedding.  He said a day before his wedding to Ms Chung, his brother was asked to list the pitfalls of her decision to marry Brown. 'How long have we got?' his brother asked the camera. Shortly after Brown shared the lighthearted clip, his wife was dead. On the same day, Brown was also on both Twitter and Instagram sharing articles and interacting with his followers.  The 'dorky' university lecturer often harped on in classes about the permanence of the internet.  Now, sweet moments he shared online with his students and network have been inundated with comments from strangers weighing in on his personal life. On International Woman's Day last March, Brown posted a gushing tribute to his 'strong, creative and hilarious' wife on Instagram. He said Ms Cheng made him 'laugh every day' while keeping him sane and ensuring he was 'on time with everything'. In a separate tribute to his son just a week ago, Brown described fatherhood as 'the best journey to be on'. The tender message accompanied a photo of his two-year-old son walking in the distance. Brown's children regularly featured on his social media channels and he would even incorporate them into lessons by filming them and making short videos of their day-to-day activities. Ms Cheng, meanwhile, often helped as well despite 'preferring interior design, construction management and cooking'. The couple appeared to go from strength to strength during the pandemic. One video shared to TikTok shows Ms Cheng giggling as she and her husband experimented with virtual reality technology. Their children's toys were littered through the background of the video. Brown's staff profile was pulled from the Deakin University website on Tuesday afternoon. He'd described himself as 'passionate about non-human animal welfare and human rights' with a particular interest in Holocaust representation.  Brown faced a brief court hearing via video link on Monday afternoon where he did not apply for bail. It was formally refused.  No further details of Ms Cheng's alleged murder were discussed during the court hearing. Emergency services were called to the family home on Patrick Avenue, in the city's northeast, at about 10.15pm on Saturday night. It's understood forensic officers were met with an 'extremely graphic' scene with bloodstained items taken from the townhouse in evidence bags as specialist detectives combed the property for clues. Bags of children's toys were also taken from the scene. Videos Brown shared from inside his home showed walls lined with toys and games in shared living spaces. A neighbour reportedly gave the mother-of-two CPR for 15 minutes before paramedics arrived but she could not be revived. Others recalled hearing a woman scream, with one saying they had mistaken the commotion for animals screeching in the night. Brown's case will return to court in September. Prosecutors must present a brief of evidence by August. ",

Emergency services were called to Isabella Falls, southwest of Cairns, at about 3pm on Monday, after the young woman fell.   Paramedics said the patient - who wasn't alone at the time of the incident - suffered critical injuries. She died at the scene. They are not treating her death as suspicious.  The waterfall has become a recent cult favourite on Instagram with people rushing to the 'hidden gem' for a photo-op.  Member for Cairns Michael Healy shared a tribute to the young girl on Tuesday and reminded hikers to be careful in the region.  'Sadly, a young person from Manunda (Cairns) has lost her life after an accident at Isabella Falls yesterday,' he wrote. 'I offer my deepest sympathies to the young woman's family and friends, who are processing this tragic news and grieving today. 'The Far North is a natural playground, abundant with beauty and adventure. But those adventures also present certain dangers, and I urge everyone to please take extra care when exploring our backyard, and to always follow the safety advice on offer.' Police will prepare a report for the coroner. The waterfall is just 56km north of the infamous Devil's Pool at Babinda Creekwhich has claimed 19 lives since the 1950s. Swimming is prohibited at Devil's Pool as it is sacred to local Indigenous people who believe the spot is haunted. ",

Cops identified the woman as Marie Hoskins, 93, a native of Sebastian, Florida.  Following the gruesome discovery, Hoskins' 64-year-old daughter, Michelle Hoskins, was taken in by police for questioning. She was apparently also living in the house, cops said. According to a statement from the Sebastian Police Department, Hoskins' neighbors became worried when they had not heard from the 93-year-old in days. Investigators managed to obtain a key for Hoskins' home, along the 100 block of Paddock Lane, in the city from a relative who lives out of town.  Michelle Hoskins was pictured being led away by police in reporting by Sebastian Daily.   The phone number associated with the home has been disconnected.  Inside, officers were met by Hoskins' daughter. Following a brief search of the home, Hoskins' body was found inside of the chest freezer in the garage.  As Michelle Hoskins went with police for questioning, a formal search warrant was issued and officers completed a sweep of the home. In an interview with Sebastian Daily, Captain Timothy Wood described the 64-year-old as a 'suspect' in the case.  While in a separate interview with WPTV, Wood said that officers investigating the case had an 'odd feeling' about Hoskins' disappearance.    It's not clear when Marie Hoskins was last seen. A neighbor told WPTV that he rarely saw Marie Hoskins, sometimes she would check her mailbox. Records show that Hoskins bought the home in 2006 and lived there with professional musician George Vannoy. Vannoy died in March 2019 at the age of 86.  According to a neighbor's Facebook page, prior to moving to Sebastian, Hoskins worked as a supervisor at the Kennedy Space Center during the space race of the 1960s.  Hoskins previously lived in Cocoa Beach, Florida.  ",
  "131c21b1b5a64caba2d70e3b381f85329bcd3842616555b35d04fc16": "President Joe Biden met Monday with the parents of American journalist Austin Tice, who was abducted in Syria nearly 10 years ago, the White House said. 'During their meeting, the President reiterated his commitment to continue to work through all available avenues to secure Austin's long overdue return to his family,' White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement summarizing the meeting with Marc and Debra Tice. She described the encounter as an outgrowth of 'multiple meetings and conversations' between the Tice family and White House national security officials. Debra Tice was introduced Saturday night as being in attendance at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, where Biden paid tribute in his remarks to journalists who are killed, injured, detained or go missing while covering conflicts. Biden also said at the event that he wanted to meet with the Tices to speak about their son. During Saturday night's event, WHCA president Steve Portnoy of CBC News asked Debra Tice to stand and paid tribute to her son, a freelance reporter who worked for CBS, The Washington Post, and McClatchy. He was kidnapped in Syria on August 14, 2012.  'All over the world, journalists are subjected to jailing and intimidation for the use of pen pad camera and keyboard. They've been tortured, murdered, kidnapped, and we must never forget, Portnoy said. Speaking of Austin Tice, Portnoy said: 'He should be here with us tonight. But he's been held captive in Syria since 2012. As we take note of Trevor Reed's return our thoughts tonight are with Austin Tice.' Biden, who also spoke at the event then said he would like to meet with her.  Halfway through his speech, Biden said to Debra: 'Mom, I'd like to meet you and Dad to talk about your son.'  'After the president made those comments, obviously we went into action to work to set up the meeting,' Psaki said Monday, adding that the White House has 'been very closely engaged with the family.' 'Today's meeting built on multiple meetings and conversations between the Tice family and the President's national security team, which will remain in regular contact with the Tices and other families of Americans held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad. 'We appreciate the bravery and candor of families enduring these harrowing experiences, and we remain committed to supporting them and, most importantly, reuniting them with their loved ones,' she said in a statement. Tice, a freelance journalist who is from Houston disappeared in August 2012 at a checkpoint in a contested area west of Damascus. A video released weeks later showed him blindfolded and held by armed men and saying, 'Oh, Jesus.'  Only one video showing him alive and he has not been heard from since. Syria has never acknowledged holding him. In the final months of the Trump administration, two U.S. officials - including the government's top hostage negotiator, Roger Carstens - made a secret visit to Damascus to seek information on Tice and other Americans who have disappeared in Syria.  It was the highest-level talk in years between the U.S. and the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad, though Syrian officials offered no meaningful information on Tice. At the time, Syrian officials told CBS News  that the Syrian government said no discussion could take place about U.S. hostages as long as U.S. military forces remained in Syria. Roughly 900 U.S. troops are in Syria.  Psaki told reporters earlier in the day that there had been multiple meetings between members of the Tice family and administration officials in the last six months, including one last week. Debra Tice had previously been critical of her lack of direct White House access, saying at a National Press Club event last December that she had not been able to get a meeting with Biden since he became president and that he had never said Austin's name publicly. 'The hurdle I'm having is the White House,' she said then, adding, 'I wonder if he's allowed himself to forget about Austin. I don't have any indication otherwise.' The Biden administration called on Syria to return Tice last year. 'We believe that it is within Bashar al-Assad's power to free Austin,' Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement in August marking Tice's 40th birthday. Last week, the U.S. secured the release of Trevor Reed, a U.S. Marine veteran detained in Russia for nearly three years, as part of a prisoner swap.  Relatives of Reed and other detained Americans are holding a news conference near the White House on Wednesday to advocate for their loved ones' release.",
  "f4e3e9170f991ae1332d6240c6e18a88f01ec3cb17f5b0f60cf6ac72": "Donald Trump will campaign in Wyoming for Rep. Liz Cheney's Republican primary challenger in an effort to unseat one of his most vocal critics in Congress, the ex-president announced on Monday. Trump will hold one of his campaign-style Make America Great Again rallies in Casper, Wyoming on behalf of lawyer Harriet Hageman on May 28. It'll be the first event Trump holds with Hageman, who he endorsed in September.  Less than two weeks later, Cheney and fellow lawmakers on the House Select Committee investigating the January 6 Capitol attack will hold their first public hearings that they have promised will reveal explosive information on the former president and his allies' efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Cheney is the panel's vice chair and one of just two Republican members, alongside Rep. Adam Kinzinger. Her work on the committee and criticism of Trump have made her a favorite target for the former president's attacks.  She was also the highest-profile House Republican who voted to impeach him following the Capitol riot. Trump frequently dismisses Cheney as a RINO or 'Republican In Name Only,' and has lambasted Wyoming's lone at-large House representative as a 'psycho' and 'not the brightest person' according to a book by Washington Examiner reporter David Drucker. And despite raising more than $10 million for her 2022 re-election campaign so far, Cheney still may be facing an uphill battle in Wyoming's August 16 primary race. She and Kinzinger have been ostracized by much of their party since their efforts to investigate the January 6th attack. Unlike Cheney, Kinzinger has said he will not seek re-election in the House this year. The Wyoming Republican was booted out of her No. 3 job in the House GOP as its conference chair, with colleagues voting to replace her with pro-Trump Rep. Elise Stefanik. Then on February 7, the Republican National Committee voted to censure the pair in a highly unusual move against two sitting lawmakers within their caucus.  The Republican leader, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, followed Trump in endorsing Hageman later that month. Trump said in a September 9 statement, 'I strongly endorse Republican House of Representatives Candidate Harriet Hageman from Wyoming who is running against warmonger and disloyal Republican, Liz Cheney.'  'Unlike RINO Liz Cheney, Harriet is all in for America First,' he continued. 'Harriet has my Complete and Total Endorsement in replacing the Democrats number one provider of sound bites, Liz Cheney.' Cheney shot back at the time: 'Here's a sound bite for you: Bring it.' Hageman has raised slightly more than $2 million so far in her campaign, according to the most recent campaign filings through the end of March. McCarthy's re-election PAC donated two separate $2,000 checks to Hageman in March. She got the same sum from pro-Trump GOP Rep. Jim Jordan. Trump's Save America PAC gave Hageman two donations of $5,000 each at the end of last year. The Wyoming rally will happen less than two weeks before the January 6 committee begins the first of eight public hearings on June 9. One of its members, Democrat Rep. Jamie Raskin, suggested they would be explosive in nature in a statement late last week.  'We now have evidence to support the story of the worst presidential political offense against the Union in American history,' Raskin said on April 29. He added that the upcoming hearings 'will expose every facet of the assault against our democracy and Constitution on 1/6.'  Kinzinger, Cheney's fellow Republican member, said during a Sunday CBS News interview that he would 'love' to see former Vice President Mike Pence testify at the hearings. Pence had reportedly refused to take part in enacting a legal theory that claimed he as vice president had sole power to overturn the election results in several states that narrowly went to President Joe Biden.  'I would love to see that. I hope he would do so voluntarily,' Kinzinger told Face The Nation. 'These are decisions I think, that we're going to end up making from a tactical perspective in the next week or two as we basically pin down what this hearing schedule is going to look like, the content and as we go into the full narrative of this thing.' He continued, 'I would hope and think that the Vice President would want to come in and tell his story because he did do the right thing on that day.' 'If he doesn't, then we'll look at the options we have available to us if there's information we don't already have.'",
  "d6069851f425f74575296a03ed281313ca0f0cd989bd02d92c3ed2c9": "The jury selection for Parkland school mass shooter Nikolas Cruz's death penalty hearing has been delayed for at least another week after the lead attorney fell ill.  Nickolas Cruz, 23, who was seen in court on Monday without his face mask, pled guilty in November to all 17 counts of premeditated murder and 17 counts of attempted murder of 14 students and three staff members at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14, 2018.  The penalty trial will decide if Cruz receives a sentence of life in prison without parole or the death penalty in the Valentine's Day massacre.  At Monday's hearing, Melissa McNeill, Cruz's lead public defender, was absent. No explanation was given.  When Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer inquired if she was being tested, a private conversation was held, between the attorney's and Scherer, after which she adjourned, and said she hoped everyone stayed well, the Associated Press reported. The jury selection will now be delayed until May 9.  Broward County Public Defender Gordon Weekes also declined to discuss the reason why McNeill was not present and did not disclose whether she had COVID-19 or any other illness.  Another no show at Monday's hearing was one of the assistant prosecutors, who was also absent from without explanation.   Over the last few weeks, Scherer and the attorneys have screened almost 1,900 jurors during the first phase. Of that number 400 members said they were available to serve the duration of the four month trial that is set to begin mid-June and run through September. Prospective jurors were asked to fill out questionnaires about their backgrounds, their knowledge of the case and their opinions on the death penalty.       Judge Scherer, who has been on the Parkland shooter case since 2018, has had her share of drama stopping and re-starting jury selection since the high-profile case began. In April, one juror named 'Miss Bristol,' was excused after telling the judge she didn't have time for it because she is too busy juggling her husband and her sugar daddy. The woman, known only as 'Miss Bristol', told the court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, that she had a lot of other commitments that she couldn't divert her attention from in order to serve on the jury in Cruz's case. Miss Bristol told the judge: 'Well I am married and I have my sugar daddy. I see him every day.' Her bizarre explanation rendered Judge Scherer speechless, who later replied: 'OK. All right. Ma'am, we'll come back to you, OK? Thank you.'     That same month, a potential juror caused another dramatic scene in court, after a 30-something man, 'mouthed expletives' toward Cruz, and appeared ready to attack the school shooter, as he got other jurors riled up. Bailiffs had to quickly remove the man from the Florida courtroom as the man  vigorously shook his head and muttered 'that's horrible' repeatedly.   The second phase of the trial that has since been postponed since May 9 will involve the prosecutors and defense asking the jurors whether they can put aside whatever knowledge they already have of Cruz, including all the extensive media coverage they may have read and vote for his sentence based on what is presented in court.  At this time, jurors must also say whether they can vote for the death penalty if they believe Florida law requires it, but they also don't believe all murderers should face execution. Those who pass that stage are expected to be brought back a third time for more questioning before the panel of jurors is selected which is compromised of 12 jurors and eight alternates. At Monday's hearing, Scherer and the attorneys present had resolved one outstanding issue which was the judge's erroneous dismissal of 11 potential jurors during initial screening nearly a month ago. Since jury selection began a few weeks ago, potential jurors were brought to the Florida courtroom in groups of 60 or 70 people. During this time, the judge asked the potential jurors two questions: 'Do you know Cruz or any of the attorneys?' 'Can you serve four months?' However, during one early group, the judge had asked a third question: 'Can you follow the law?' That question was apparently supposed to be asked at a later phase. In the interim,  a few jurors raised their hands during the questioning indicating they could not follow the law, then a few more hands were raised, bringing the number to 12.  Scherer dismissed those 12 members without allowing the attorneys to question them. The  attorney's should have been allowed to question them. Both sides objected. Scherer tried to get them back, but 11 of the potential jurors had already left the courthouse.  That led Scherer last week to order that jury selection start anew over the objection of Cruz's attorneys, a decision that would have thrown out 250 potential jurors. Prosecutors feared Scherer had made a mistake that could result in a death penalty verdict being thrown out on appeal. Scherer then reversed her decision two days later over the objection of prosecutors and said the 250 potential jurors were still part of the pool. Summonses were then issued to 11 people. Ten of them showed up in court on Monday. Nine had been dismissed because they had work or family conflicts that prevented them from serving for four months, while the 10th potential juror said he could serve. That person filled out the questionnaire and will be brought back for the second phase. The 12 jurors that will be chosen will determine whether aggravating factors, such as the number of people he murdered, his extensive planning, and his cruelty outweigh the mitigating factors, such as his long history of mental and emotional problems, his possible sexual abuse and the death of his parents.  If one juror sides with the defense, Cruz will receive a life sentence.",
  "9d46936c214a73cfdeeed7eb981198db976c3622eac6759c3d12dd09": "Economy class passengers on board a Qantas flight to London were informed just 15 minutes before touchdown that their luggage had been left behind in Darwin. Qantas has apologised to passengers who flew from Sydney to London last week after recent airport repairs meant luggage was offloaded during refuelling in the Northern Territory. The luggage didn't arrive in the UK until three days after passengers had landed. Passengers flying on Monday were still being affected by the baggage chaos, being told at Sydney Airport that it would follow on a later plane and be couriered to their homes - leaving them arriving in London with few possessions.  Qantas has flown via Darwin for Sydney to London flights since the beginning of the Covid pandemic.  A spokesperson for Qantas told Daily Mail Australia that the luggage delay was caused by runway repairs at Darwin airport  which have now been fixed. 'An issue with the runway pavement at Darwin Airport resulted in temporary additional weight restrictions on our flights to London last week and unfortunately that meant we weren't able to carry some passengers' bags on their flight,' they said. 'Bags were reaccommodated on later flights and are couriered directly to customers as soon as we're able to confirm the correct address.  'We apologise the inconvenience this has caused our passengers and thank them for their understanding. 'We're advised that the pavement issue causing the weight restriction has now been fixed.'",
  "3178eeea0656017597e1ffd95b2d37740339855fba01056f37de6fcc": "One Nation leader Pauline Hanson has claimed that Labor's housing plan is the first step of the 'Great Reset' arriving in Australia, referring to a global Covid recovery plan which has been seized upon by right-wing politicians.  Anthony Albanese announced the key plank of the Opposition's Federal election platform - the 'Help to Buy' initiative - which aims to assist low and middle income earners in purchasing a house. If Labor wins the election, the government will provide 10,000 Australians with a Commonwealth contribution to their home equity of up to 40 per cent. Buyers can pay back the stake when they sell their house, or earn over a certain threshold. Senator Hanson labelled the program as 'another step towards socialism' and fulfilling the promise of 'The Great Reset'.  'Anthony Albanese's plan to take a 40 per cent stake in home ownership is akin to Klaus Schwab suggesting you will own nothing and be happy', Senator Hanson said.  Mr Schwab is the founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum. He wrote in June 2020 that the Covid pandemic was an opportunity to 'emerge from this crisis a better world, if we act quickly and jointly'.  A book he co-authored, titled The Great Reset, outlines how the pandemic exposed inequality in society, how billionaires' wealth grew amid the crisis and how environmental and social protections have been cast aside. 'Left unaddressed, these crises will deepen and leave the world even less sustainable, less equal, and more fragile,' he wrote. 'Small fixes will not suffice to prevent this scenario. We must build entirely new foundations for our economic and social systems.' 'We must use it to secure the Great Reset that we so badly need.' Ms Hanson on Monday claimed Labor's housing scheme was 'the first step to fulfilling the World Economic Forum's 'Great Reset'. The term is from a 2020 book written by World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab. He claimed the Covid pandemic highlighted social and economic inequality.  The mobility of populations to respond quickly to Covid showed widespread change is possible, he said. 'Clearly, the will to build a better society does exist. We must use it to secure the Great Reset that we so badly need,' he wrote. 'If we're to make housing affordable for Australians, start by closing the door to foreign ownership, and lower immigration numbers - it's not rocket science.' Ms Hanson said. She referenced Housing Industry Association data which showed 16,107 new homes were built in the first quarter of 2022.  'Data compiled by the National Australia Bank shows foreign investors purchased approximately 3.7%, or 595 of those new homes,' she said. 'If we're to cool the housing market to enable Australians a chance of owning their own home, it needs to be without competition from overseas buyers.'  'Having government buy an equity stake in a person's home is a frightening use of taxpayers money when government should be paying down debt.' 'With interest rates on the rise, Labor's intervention in the housing market is a recipe for disaster.' Ms Hanson said she supports superannuation funds being used to purchase homes on the proviso the money is paid back when the house is sold, The Coalition has slammed Labor's housing initiative, saying that their model of affordable housing, which includes the First Home Guarantee Scheme, is superior.  That scheme, which Labor will also keep, allows first home buyers to secure a property with a 5 per cent deposit with the government acting as a guarantor to avoid expensive mortgage lender's insurance.   'You don't have Mr Albanese at the kitchen table with you owning part of your home,' Liberal finance minister Simon Birmingham said. Labor's Help to Buy scheme will provide an equity contribution of up to 40 per cent of the purchase price of a new home, and up to 30 per cent for an existing dwelling, with buyers needing a minimum deposit of two per cent.  Australians will be able to buy back an additional stake in the home, owned by the federal government, in five per cent increments or pay the government back when they sell. The scheme is not exclusive to first home buyers but participants must be Australian citizens and live in the home for two years. 'After nine long years in government, housing affordability has only got worse under the Liberal-National government,' Mr Albanese said on Sunday. 'Help to Buy is part of Labor's plan to tackle the housing crisis.' 'This scheme is not just for first homebuyers, it's for other Australians who need a helping hand as well,' Mr Albanese said. 'It's hard for first homebuyers. It's also hard for many older Australians.' Labor says the scheme could cut the cost of a mortgage by up to $380,000. The value of homes eligible under the scheme will be capped, based on the city and region. Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum, wrote about the Great Reset in 2020. Read his full blog post below: COVID-19 lockdowns may be gradually easing, but anxiety about the world's social and economic prospects is only intensifying. There is good reason to worry: a sharp economic downturn has already begun, and we could be facing the worst depression since the 1930s. But, while this outcome is likely, it is not unavoidable.  To achieve a better outcome, the world must act jointly and swiftly to revamp all aspects of our societies and economies, from education to social contracts and working conditions. Every country, from the United States to China, must participate, and every industry, from oil and gas to tech, must be transformed. In short, we need a 'Great Reset' of capitalism. There are many reasons to pursue a Great Reset, but the most urgent is COVID-19. Having already led to hundreds of thousands of deaths, the pandemic represents one of the worst public-health crises in recent history. And, with casualties still mounting in many parts of the world, it is far from over. This will have serious long-term consequences for economic growth, public debt, employment, and human wellbeing. According to the Financial Times, global government debt has already reached its highest level in peacetime. Moreover, unemployment is skyrocketing in many countries: in the US, for example, one in four workers have filed for unemployment since mid-March, with new weekly claims far above historic highs. The International Monetary Fund expects the world economy to shrink by 3% this year - a downgrade of 6.3 percentage points in just four months. All of this will exacerbate the climate and social crises that were already underway. Some countries have already used the COVID-19 crisis as an excuse to weaken environmental protections and enforcement. And frustrations over social ills like rising inequality - US billionaires' combined wealth has increased during the crisis - are intensifying. Left unaddressed, these crises, together with COVID-19, will deepen and leave the world even less sustainable, less equal, and more fragile. Incremental measures and ad hoc fixes will not suffice to prevent this scenario. We must build entirely new foundations for our economic and social systems. The level of cooperation and ambition this implies is unprecedented. But it is not some impossible dream. In fact, one silver lining of the pandemic is that it has shown how quickly we can make radical changes to our lifestyles. Almost instantly, the crisis forced businesses and individuals to abandon practices long claimed to be essential, from frequent air travel to working in an office. Likewise, populations have overwhelmingly shown a willingness to make sacrifices for the sake of health-care and other essential workers and vulnerable populations, such as the elderly. And many companies have stepped up to support their workers, customers, and local communities, in a shift toward the kind of stakeholder capitalism to which they had previously paid lip service. Clearly, the will to build a better society does exist. We must use it to secure the Great Reset that we so badly need. That will require stronger and more effective governments, though this does not imply an ideological push for bigger ones. And it will demand private-sector engagement every step of the way. The Great Reset agenda would have three main components. The first would steer the market toward fairer outcomes. To this end, governments should improve coordination (for example, in tax, regulatory, and fiscal policy), upgrade trade arrangements, and create the conditions for a 'stakeholder economy.' At a time of diminishing tax bases and soaring public debt, governments have a powerful incentive to pursue such action. Moreover, governments should implement long-overdue reforms that promote more equitable outcomes. Depending on the country, these may include changes to wealth taxes, the withdrawal of fossil-fuel subsidies, and new rules governing intellectual property, trade, and competition. The second component of a Great Reset agenda would ensure that investments advance shared goals, such as equality and sustainability. Here, the large-scale spending programs that many governments are implementing represent a major opportunity for progress. The European Commission, for one, has unveiled plans for a EUR750 billion ($826 billion) recovery fund. The US, China, and Japan also have ambitious economic-stimulus plans. Rather than using these funds, as well as investments from private entities and pension funds, to fill cracks in the old system, we should use them to create a new one that is more resilient, equitable, and sustainable in the long run. This means, for example, building 'green' urban infrastructure and creating incentives for industries to improve their track record on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics. The third and final priority of a Great Reset agenda is to harness the innovations of the Fourth Industrial Revolution to support the public good, especially by addressing health and social challenges. During the COVID-19 crisis, companies, universities, and others have joined forces to develop diagnostics, therapeutics, and possible vaccines; establish testing centers; create mechanisms for tracing infections; and deliver telemedicine. Imagine what could be possible if similar concerted efforts were made in every sector.  The COVID-19 crisis is affecting every facet of people's lives in every corner of the world. But tragedy need not be its only legacy. On the contrary, the pandemic represents a rare but narrow window of opportunity to reflect, reimagine, and reset our world to create a healthier, more equitable, and more prosperous future.       Immigration: Will extend its zero-net migration policy and focus on permitting only highly skilled migrants from culturally cohesive countries into Australia. Water: Will build new water infrastructure projects, including dams and increase the supply to Australian farmers and our growing nation. Jobs: Does not support casualisation of the workforce and instead embraces full-time jobs.  Refugees: Believes in reducing the refugee intake for five years.  Energy: Supports the investigation of nuclear power in Australia. It strongly opposes subsidy schemes offered to foreign-owned solar and wind projects.  Trade: Believes the Australian Constitution must be upheld at all times and not undermined by United Nations forums and its 193 member states.  Climate: Claims to be 'the only political party to question climate science'.  Family law: Strongly supports the implementation of a fairer child support system whereby the children are financially supported, not the ex-partner.  Education: Believes there should be no room for Western, white, gender, guilt shaming in any classroom and instead children should be taught the benefits of a merit-based, free-thinking society.  Medical cannabis: Believes that whole plant medicinal cannabis continues to act as a natural, proven alternative for chronic pain relief and other serious health symptoms experienced by Australians.

His comments come after leaflets from the Cancer Council were sent out by teachers at NSW schools telling kids to stop eating ham sandwiches because processed meat is linked to an increased risk of cancer.  The 'healthy eating leaflets' have prompted a furious backlash from parents, who say they're sick of the 'nanny state' telling them what to feed their kids. Stefanovic also hit back against the Cancer Council's health advice on Tuesday morning, declaring 'hands off our ham'. 'I think this is just ridiculous,' Stefanovic explained. 'I don't know where they get off doing this.' He said it should be up to children to decide whether they eat ham sandwiches. 'I don't know what I would do without having a ham and cheese sandwich after a hangover on a Saturday morning,' he said. 'This is an attack on the national consciousness more than anything else. He spoke with butcher David Bligh, owner of Bringelly Pork & Bacon in Sydney, and asked him what he thought about the 'woke brigade' coming for ham sandwiches. 'There's many people who bring up all sorts of issues about food and chemicals and things like that,' Mr Bligh explained.  'But a lot of the preservatives and things that are put in ham and bacon are actually naturally occurring and also found in vegetables.' However a Cancer Council spokeswoman defended the leaflets and says they are part of a health campaign to get children eating better food.  Snack: juice or cordial.

Parents have also been told to avoid adding muesli bars, and savoury biscuits to their children's school lunch boxes by the organisation. Instead of a muesli bar, the Cancer Council suggested parents whip up a homemade version, or some zucchini, broccoli and cheese hashbrown cups.  Alternative options for a slice of cake included fruit loaf and pumpkin and sweet potato scones.  For fruit juice, milk or water was suggested instead, and for a bag of biscuits, parents were encouraged to consider giving their kids pita bread and roast vegetable dip, or vegetable muffins.  Popcorn and roasted chickpeas were other options parents were told to consider over a packet of chips.  Eating more than 700 grams (raw weight) of red meat a week increases your risk of bowel cancer? Or that the risk of developing bowel cancer goes up 1.18 times for every 50 grams of processed meat eaten per day? The World Health Organization has classified processed meats including ham, bacon, salami and frankfurts as a Group 1 carcinogen (known to cause cancer) which means that there's strong evidence that processed meats cause cancer. Eating processed meat increases your risk of bowel and stomach cancer. Red meat, such as beef, lamb and pork, has been classified as a Group 2A carcinogen which means it probably causes cancer. Current research shows that there are certain chemicals in red and processed meats - both added and naturally occurring - that cause these foods to be carcinogenic. For example, when a chemical in red meat called haem is broken down in the gut, N-nitroso chemicals are formed and these have been found to damage the cells that line the bowel, which can lead to bowel cancer. These same chemicals also form when processed meat is digested. In addition, the nitrite and nitrate preservatives used to preserve processed meat produce these N-nitroso chemicals and can lead to bowel cancer. To reduce your risk of cancer, Cancer Council recommends eating no more than 1 serve of lean red meat per day or 2 serves 3-4 times per week. Red meat includes beef, lamb and pork. Cut out processed meats altogether or keep them to an absolute minimum. Processed meats include bacon, ham, devon, frankfurts, chorizo, cabanossi and kransky.     ",
  "e62dd12f937398911dade4c0e88bcd5c3fd4347bf81689cfc8a87b10": "An Aussie mother who spent one month in an induced coma after being smashed off her scooter in a horror hit and run in Bali has woken up. The 36-year-old has spent weeks heavily sedated on a ventilator in the ICU ward at the Alfred hospital in Melbourne, before finally waking up from her induced coma on Sunday.  Peta Richards, her husband Matt and their boys Sonny, 4, and Alfie, 3, were holidaying in Bali on April 1 when the nurse was thrown from her bike by another rider after she stepped out to buy her three-year-old 'one more birthday present'. Peta was rushed to a local hospital with severe head injuries, including bleeding on the brain, a fractured skull and extensive brain swelling. She was in a critical condition in an induced coma after doctors at the International Hospital in Kuta performed life-saving surgery by removing part of her skull to relieve pressure on her brain. Peta's husband Matt, worked tirelessly to coordinate his wife's transfer to Melbourne hospital and was flown back on a medical evacuation flight 10 days after the accident. Her close friend Rachel Berben shared the hopeful news to the GoFundMe account set up to help financially support Peta and her family. 'She has been transferred from ICU to a ward. She is currently awake and making small steps day by day,' Ms Berben wrote. 'She will require some further surgeries in the coming weeks. 'From here she will then progress onto intensive neuro rehabilitation to begin her journey forward.' The mother-of-two faces a lengthy road to recovery with friends and family asking those following Peta's journey to keep her in their 'prayers and thoughts'.   Peta and her family had been waiting more than two years to go on a trip away together with the beloved mother working on the frontline throughout the pandemic.  They had landed in Bali at the end of February and were five weeks into the trip before she decided she would head out on a short trip to get another present for Alfie, when the experienced motorcyclist became the victim of a hit and run. Ms Berben said the accident was a matter of being at 'the wrong place at the wrong time' 'She has her motorbike licence, she has her international licence, she has travel insurance, she wore a helmet,' Ms Berben said. 'She was doing everything right.' Husband Matt has been by her side the entire time, ensuring Peta was safely moved among Balinese hospitals, arranging flights home all while looking after their young children. 'He is absolutely inhuman. What he's done is beyond the capacity of one person,' friend Ms Berben told Daily Mail Australia. Her husband Matt, mother and sister have been constantly at her side while sharing the responsibilities of looking after Sonny and Alfie.   'Never in a million years would you think that popping out on a 7-minute trip to buy your 3-year-old son 'one more birthday present' would completely change the entire course of your life,' Ms Berben said.  'It's completely horrific that in that split section their life was flipped upside down. 'Just knowing she's never going to have the life she's had before potentially, it's going to be a long road to get back to something like that with her boys.' Rachel said Sonny and Alfie aren't 'fully aware' of what is going on with their mum. 'It's so hard to tell a three and four-year-old what's happened, they just think she's sick. It's just devastating.'  The GoFundMe account has seen more than 1,500 donations totalling $141,118 and received one donation of $10,000 from a complete stranger.  The family were shocked by the outpouring of support she's received so quickly. 'They are completely overwhelmed and appreciative of everyone's supportive messages, outreach and donations, so thank you all so much,' Rachel posted to the page.",
  "b64e8e3e818a9197f05447e82a556260827718393f8d48bbcff45aa5": "A high school teacher is still denying she had an intimate relationship with a 13-year-old student after she was found guilty of sexually assaulting him and ordered to pay more than $1.4 million in compensation.  Nicholas Brockhurst, 39, successfully sued former Toowoomba Grammar English teacher Meredith Rawlings for abusing him when he was boarding at the school between the ages of 13 and 14. Mr Brockhurst said the pair began their relationship when he was in his first year of high school in 1996, when he was just 13 and Mrs Rawlings was 30. He was living more than 200km from his parents in Drillham and said he had found Mrs Rawlings 'very friendly' during his first year at the school and appreciated that she cared about his schoolwork and progress. During this time Mrs Rawlings offered Mr Brockhurst private tutoring sessions and would often call for him to come to her office over the loudspeaker at lunchtimes or after school.  Mr Brockhurst said he and Mrs Rawlings had grown 'closer' by the middle of the year and were 'getting to know each other'. He said Mrs Rawlings would give him more attention than other students and write him love letters and songs.  In one letter read to the court, Mrs Rawlings wrote: 'I'm thinking of you every minute of the day - I go to sleep with you on my mind and wake up the same way.  'I love you very much. I really love you.'  However, when asked by A Current Affair what the meaning behind her letters was, Mrs Rawlings said it was clear 'they are not love letters'. Mrs Rawlings similarly denied writing love songs for the teenager in court, where she claimed she had given Mr Brockhurst the songs to learn on guitar, not in a romantic capacity. Mr Brockhurst said he didn't own a guitar while boarding at the school and wasn't taking lessons.  Their relationship then began to escalate. Mr Brockhurst said he would skip dinner to spend extra hours with Mrs Rawlings - often in her car - before the teacher would head home to her husband, a chef who worked late. 'We were hugging, kissing, things like that at that stage. It was very regular and something not maternal. It clearly meant something to both of us,' he said.  By 1997 - when Mr Brockhurst was 14 - other students began to notice their strangely close relationship and would call Mr Brockhurst 'the chosen one', 'the special one', and 'teacher's pet' and reported seeing the pair in 'compromising positions' to the school. Mrs Rawlings was directed by the school to not be alone with Mr Brockhurst but ignored instruction and invited Mr Brockhurst to stay at her house overnight where they had sex for the first time. 'I didn't know better at the time. I thought it was extremely special that this person was much older than me and we got along so well,' Mr Brockhurst said. However Mrs Rawlings denies the pair were ever intimate. 'Do you know how horrendous it was to listen to Nick Brockhurst talking about these allegations. It's unbelievable, it's so stressful especially when you know he's sitting there and he's not telling the truth,' she said.  Later that year Mr Brockhurst's parents found some of the love letters written by Mrs Rawlings to their teenage son and reported it to the school. Mr Brockhurst said Mrs Rawlings 'vanished into thin air' and said he was 'devastated' by her disappearance. He said he has suffered from financial loss and depression while struggling to recover from the relationship and successfully sued Mrs Rawlings for $1,456,524 in August, 2021 - some 24 years after Mrs Rawlings left the school. A judge found Mrs Rawlings' sexual abuse of Mr Brockhurst caused him personal injury, including a depressive disorder. Mrs Rawlings told A Current Affair she didn't appeal the decision because she doesn't have the money to pursue the case.   Mrs Rawlings has since filed for bankruptcy and said she can't afford to pay Mr Brockhurst's compensation bill, despite partially owning a popular restaurant and two properties in Toowoomba. However Mr Brockhurst said he wasn't chasing compensation and that he sued Mrs Rawlings because her actions had 'nearly destroyed' his life and that it was 'about telling Australia or the world, this is what happened to me'.

  "ca6aa857f58d91cfa16b43f10a3ba688492258b9af4cc4692757f9e1": "Australians who buy a home under Labor's new Help To Buy Scheme could be forced to sell if they earn more than $90,000. Anthony Albanese has proposed a shared ownership scheme where the government would buy 40 per cent of a home to help aspiring buyers who would otherwise not be able to afford the house.    It would only be available to couples earning less than $120,000 and singles earning less than $90,000. But Labor has now admitted that if someone on the scheme starts earning over the threshold then they will have to buy out the government's stake - or sell the house.  This would also apply if the owner died and their children who inherited it earned over the threshold. Speaking on Sky News on Tuesday morning, Labor Deputy Leader Richard Marles confirmed owners would have to sell if they earned over $90,000 and could not afford to buy out the Government.    'Now, if during the course of their life, they acquire wealth, which means they themselves no longer qualify for the scheme, well, then in that circumstance, they would need to be buying out the government,' he said.  'And that's fair. So it puts them on the same footing as anyone else who has means.  'And that's the way it would apply in relation to their children. So, children who have means want to keep the house in the family, that can be done.' Host Peter Stefanovic asked 'what if they can't afford that though?' and Mr Marles replied: 'They don't take up that option, in which case the property would then be sold.'  Prime Minister Scott Morrison blasted the scheme on Melbourne's Radio 3AW on Tuesday.  'Anthony Albanese would put a for sale sign on your lawn. This is insane,' he said.  Finance Minister Simon Birmingham also slammed the policy, telling Sky News: 'If you die and your kids earn a few thousand bucks extra, Labor will force the sale of the family home at that point. 'If you yourself earn a few thousand dollars extra under this deal of joint home ownership with a Labor government, then you'll have to suddenly come up with potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars.' Housing Minister Michael Sukkar said: 'It was bad enough having Albanese at your kitchen table - now he will be sitting there at the reading of the will, waiting for his cut of your family's home.'  It comes as mortgage bills are predicted to rise on the back of an expected interest rate hike on Tuesday. Labor says their policy will not push up house prices because it is capped at 10,000 places per year.  Mr Morrison on Monday said that last year 164,000 Australians got into their first home - 70,000 more than when Labor left office. His government introduced the Home Guarantee Scheme which allows Aussies to purchase first homes with a deposit of just five per cent, with the Government guaranteeing the other 15 per cent.  Single parents only need a two per cent deposit.  Last month the PM announced an increase in the price cap to a maximum of $900,000.   Worsening housing affordability has seen home ownership for low and moderate income earners decline from 60 per cent to 28 per cent over the last 40 years. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported a 23.7 per cent increase in residential property prices in the last 12 months alone. Help to Buy will be available to Australians with a taxable income of up to $90,000 for individuals and up to $120,000 for couples.  Homebuyers must be Australian citizens and not currently own or have an interest in a residential dwelling. They do not need to be first home buyers. Eligible homebuyers will get an equity contribution of up to 40 per cent of the purchase price of a new home and up to 30 per cent of the purchase price for an existing home. The homebuyer will need to have a deposit of 2 per cent and qualify for a standard home loan with a participating lender to finance the remainder of the purchase. During the loan period the homebuyer can buy out part of all of the government's stake in the home when they are able to do so.  The homebuyer will not be required to pay rent on the stake of the home owned by the Federal Government. ",
  "f04ac7e80d5c5944e6a6f1366427b8ef588d10c5815f3a21d30e7fe6": "A mother has recalled the horrifying moment she learnt her son's music teacher was a paedophile as he and his boyfriend admit carrying out a string of vile child sex offences.  Benjamin Heels, 33, and his partner Tristan Cullinan-Smayle pleaded guilty in Melbourne's Magistrates Court on Friday to a series of separate crimes they each carried out against children. Combined, the sick couple have admitted to more than 60 charges. Heels has admitted sexually touching a child and engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child under 16, and other offences.  The heinous acts have rocked the tight-knit Narre Warren community, in the city's southeast, where Heels was employed as a music teacher at Fountain Gate Secondary College.  A mother told Daily Mail Australia that Heels did individual lessons with the kids -  including her young son - who he taught for a year and a half. She learnt her child had been under the care of a paedophile when the school notified her shortly after Heels' arrest.  'I felt utterly sick and extremely stressed,' she said. 'As a parent we out our trust in teachers to keep our children safe while at school. 'Never would you think your worst nightmare [would eventuate] that a paedophile would be your son's teacher.'  The woman said Heels was unsuspecting and 'came across as a nice teacher who was friendly, supportive and encouraging to my son'. The situation has made her hyper-vigilant about who she allows to interact with her kids.  'You don't know who to trust when it comes to your children being safe. The person you would least expect could be the worst of the worst.' Heels also worked as well as on multiple musical productions, including Priscilla Queen of the Desert, with some of the performances involving kids.  Since his arrest, disturbing posts Heels shared on social media have resurfaced including eerie discussions about children and images of him wearing bizarre costumes.  In one, he talked about one of his student's beds. 'Why are all the kids getting awesome decked out bedrooms?' he wrote.  'My nephew has an awesome Bunk thing with a desk and shelves under it. One of my students has a loft bed with couch and bean bags under it. 'I just got normal bunk... that I kept falling out of and breaking bones.' Others featured photos of Heels dressed up as a clown and wearing Harry Potter-themed, Slytherin house pyjamas. 'I didn't know about the clown stuff,' the mother said. 'Straight away I thought of [American paedophile] John Wayne Gacy.'  Gacy, who raped young boys and men in the 1970s, regularly performed at children's hospitals and charitable events as his alter ego, 'Pogo the Clown'.   On Friday, Heels appeared before the court via video link, with court documents stating his offending occurred over a four-and-a-half month period, between January 1 and May 14, 2021. The list of 35 charges Heels admitted to, seen by Daily Mail Australia, include engaging in a sexual activity in the presence of a child under 16, intentionally sexually touching a child and producing child abuse material.  Appearing alongside his boyfriend, Cullinan-Smayle fronted court on separate offences, including possessing and transmitting child abuse material and procuring a child for sexual activity.  In total, he pleaded guilty to 27 charges.   The court heard Cullinan-Smayle's offending went back to December 2017, when at 28, he used a carriage service to procure a child to engage in sexual activity.  The pair were both the subject of interim non-publication court orders which prevented the disclosure of their identities, and also to spare them 'embarrassment', the orders said. Those orders have both expired.  The case was first reported by the Herald-Sun.  Heels was arrested on May 26, 2021 in the Melbourne suburb of Berwick where he was caught with child abuse material on an electronic device.  The court heard Heels produced child abuse material at that location between January 1 and May 20 - six days before his arrest.  In another bizarre post, Heels expressed concern to parents about children singing songs about sex.  In June 2020, Heels said that listening to children singing songs about sex made him 'uncomfortable'. 'Parents please make sure you are sending your kids to a vocal coach who understands their voice,' he wrote. 'Call me old fashioned but I cringe and get so uncomfortable hearing children sing songs about sex.'  Heels and Cullinan-Smayle will front the County Court later this month.",
  "1df467724704cfdd346af75a2b61d149dbe86ccd9b16af846b9c42ea": "Parents have been told to avoid adding muesli bars, ham sandwiches and savoury biscuits to their children's school lunch boxes. A list of 'unhealthy snacks' has been shared by the Cancer Council with Australian mums and dads offered other alternatives to give to their kids for lunch and recess. Muffins, biscuits, crackers with cheese spread and fruit boxes were all dubbed snacks families should avoid buying at the supermarket. Instead of a muesli bar, the organisation suggested parents whip up a homemade version, or some zucchini, broccoli and cheese hashbrown cups - which are shredded hashbrowns baked into the shape of a cup and filled with various toppings. Alternative options for a slice of cake included fruit loaf and pumpkin and sweet potato scones. For fruit juice, milk or water was suggested instead, and for a bag of biscuits, parents were encouraged to consider giving their kids pita bread and roast vegetable dip, or vegetable muffins. Popcorn and roasted chickpeas were other options parents were told to consider over a packet of chips. Parents were already left astonished when leaflets sent out by the organisation urging them to 'ditch the ham sandwich' were added to newsletters in public schools in NSW. The callout follows on from a previous leaflet telling children to have a 'meat-free Monday'.  Both parents and pork producers have defended the humble ham sandwich and railed against the 'politically correct message'. A pork company owner said the Cancer Council leaflets go 'too far'. 'Ham is actually a product which has been developed over the last 5,000 years and people have eaten it through the ages without any problems,' David Bligh of Bringelly Pork and Bacon. 'I think sometimes these politically correct messages can go a little bit too far and not be as practical as they should be.'  TV host Karl Stefanovic also hit back against the Cancer Council's health advice on Tuesday morning, declaring 'hands off our ham'. 'I think this is just ridiculous,' Stefanovic explained. 'I don't know where they get off doing this.'  He said it should be up to children to decide whether they eat ham sandwiches.  'I don't know what I would do without having a ham and cheese sandwich after a hangover on a Saturday morning,' he said. 'This is an attack on the national consciousness more than anything else. However, Channel Nine's U.S. correspondent, Amelia Adams, admitted she 'wasn't surprised'.  'It's such a nanny state back there,' she told Stefanovic during a Today show cross.  A Cancer Council spokeswoman said the leaflets are part of a health campaign to get children eating better food.  'Because there is strong evidence that eating processed meats and too much red meat is associated with increased risk of bowel cancer, our cancer prevention messages advise everyone to limit their processed meat consumption and cut down on red meat,' she said. She added that schools which sent the messages to include with material sent home with pupils, were not under any obligation to do so. The NSW Department of Education eased fears of parents confirming no public school had banned ham sandwiches.  NSW Transport Minister David Elliott said he wouldn't be giving up the ham sandwich. 'It is a daily battle with people who just want to get into our lives and influence our opinions and tell us what we're doing wrong and what we're doing right,' he told 2GB's Ben Fordham. 'I'm a big fan of the Cancer Council ... but I've got to say you're not doing yourselves any favour when you're trying to tell families exactly what they can and cannot eat in a society.'  Dietitian and chief health officer of HealthyLife, Simone Austin, said ham sandwiches 'are not for everyday' due to high levels of sodium and preservatives. 'I don't think we can never have them,' she told 3AW. 'I don't think we should be saying ''Don't have it'' 'It's really important kids have lunch and we don't want to make making the lunchbox particularly difficult or cumbersome for parents, that's number one, so I think let's do the message of what we can have rather than what we can't.' Ms Austin suggested leftovers from the night before or crackers and cheese could be used to give kids some variety at lunchtime.  Snack: juice or cordial.

Mr Albanese stepped behind Mr Clare following a fiery moment at a press conference on Tuesday, leading some viewers to accuse him of 'hiding' from scrutiny.  The Labor leader was quizzed about whether property investors like him should have their tax breaks taken away.  Instead of answering, Mr Albanese, who later said he owns two homes in Sydney and one in Canberra, called over Mr Clare.    Mr Clare said: 'Yeah, sure. Albo can supplement. This is not about one individual, right? This is the structural thing we've got to grapple with here.' Mr Clare - who is the shadow housing minister - proceeded to give a long-winded answer about Labor's Help To Buy policy.   Mr Albanese eventually stepped forward and said he owned two properties in Sydney and one in Canberra but added: 'This is not about one individual.' One Twitter user named Kate said: 'Albo was directly asked a question about him selling two of his investment properties which he gets tax breaks for. Albo wouldn't answer, stepped out the way to make Jason Clare answer.' Another named Tony wrote: 'Feels like he's hiding behind @JasonClareMP who just went on many tangents to use up time.'

Father of two Mr Clare has been lauded for his strong performances as campaign spokesman, sparking calls for him to become leader one day.

  "e0e4a00fe90d28f10bfaf25e8c284af6ec76528e8ba36c21099d45d0": "A killer who murdered his own grandmother and had a hit list of other family members he wanted dead will walk free from jail within days. Anthony Grant Lauritsen used a lawn edger and hammer to murder and disembowel his grandmother Margaret Lauritsen, 67, and in the Perth suburb of Calista in 1998. Her beloved pet poodle Suzie was also killed in the gruesome murder that shocked Australia and tore her family apart. Lauritsen was later sentenced to life behind bars with a non-parole period of at least 20 years. The Prisoners Review Board has now deemed Lauritsen as 'low risk of reoffending' and granted him parole to walk free from jail next week. The decision has shocked and angered Lauritsen's family who now fear for their lives. They have spent more than two decades dreading his release and fear he'll follow through with his hit list. The family had previously been told Lauritsen was not capable of rehabilitation. 'I think I'm in shock that this day has actually come,' a family spokesperson told The West Australian. 'It is just so so scary and unbelievable.'  They claim he posed a deadly threat to multiple members of the family who are now considering moving. 'He had a hit list of people he was planning on killing even whilst in jail,' the spokesperson added. Lauritsen was transferred to minimum security facility Karnet Prison Farm in 2019, where he he has since completed a Re-Socialisation program to prepare for his release back into society. Attorney-General John Quigley said he 'carefully considered' the Prisoners Review Board's recommendations. He also took community safety and the views of Mrs Lauritsen's loved ones into account before going against the family's wishes. 'The Attorney General extends his condolences to the late Margaret Lauritsen's family,' a spokesman said. 'The Attorney General noted that Mr Lauritsen has been assessed as a low risk of re-offending, recently successfully completed all stages of his RSP and served 24 years in prison -- longer than the period imposed by the court.' Lauritsen, then aged 22, killed his grandmother while she was siting in her favourite armchair before dragging her body to her bedroom where she was disembowled. He rinsed the murder weapons and left them on his aunt's bed, who he threatened to kill and tried to attack with an axe seven weeks prior. Lauristen was waiting to kill his aunt once she returned when police found and arrested the blood-soaked murderer. The judge noted Lauristen 'attempted to sever her (his grandmother's) head' and 'disemboweled her' before 'handling the contents, taking them out of the body'. The court also heard Lauristen admired Martin Bryant, who killed 35 people in the Port Arthur massacre in 1996. Lauristen was sentenced to at least 20 years in jail, which was the longest sentence ever handed down by a WA court at the time.",
  "84300254ef4ee4ba275b81bb1b3e7436e902e6a8a4d37cae43673c1e": "Scott Morrison has given a stern response to accusations by a leading radio broadcaster that he takes part in 'silly photo opportunities' during the election campaign. Top-rating 3AW breakfast host Neil Mitchell asked Mr Morrison whether he ever 'got sick of' the photos he poses for in the lead-up to the May 21 national poll.   'I know you enjoy campaigning, but do you ever get sick of those silly photo opportunities? You know, with the haircuts and buzz saws and those sorts of things,' Mitchell asked the prime minister.  'What's on the agenda today for silly photo opportunities?' Mitchell continued. 'I don't see them that way Neil,' Mr Morrison responded. 'Don't you?' Mitchell fired back. 'Whether it's cutting hair or working in tool shops or whatever - we've got 220,000 trade apprentices in trades right now, What I enjoy doing is standing there with an apprentice who shows me what they're learning. And then I'll have a go at it,' Mr Morrison explained. 'I'm trying to understand what they're learning, and I'm really proud of what they're doing.' The prime minister is famous for participating in made-for-TV opportunities where he tries his hand at a worker's job in a factory or retail outlet, even sparking a popular twitter handle #ScottyFromPhotoOps. So far this election campaign he has been seen welding, using a large mop, pretending to pilot a plane, drilling a hole in metal, sampling a whiskey barrel, playing pool and stamping zinc, among other 'stunts'.   In February - before the election had been called - the prime minister was widely criticised after he washed the hair of a young woman at a hair salon on Victoria's Mornington Peninsula. 'The images of the Prime Minister's hands massaging the apprentice's scalp and temples stirred a visceral reaction in thousands of us, including me. Not in a good way,' reacted former Liberal MP Julia Banks in an opinion column.  The exchange with Mitchell was part of a 20-minute interview that covered topics including health funding in Victoria, potential interest rate rises, Labor's plan for government funding of equity in housing and how the Coalition would deal with independents in a potential hung parliament. During the interview Mitchell said he was not into giving 'free kicks' but invited the prime minister to react to Labor's housing policy announcement on Sunday, in which the government would take a 40 per cent stake in new homebuyer's homes to help them get into the property market.  'If your household income goes above $120,000 a year, Anthony Albanese will put a for sale sign on your lawn,' Mr Morrison claimed, referring to the eligibility cap under the ALP scheme. 'You actually have to dispose of the asset and pay back the government. I mean, this is insane. 'On top of that, if something terrible happens and your property is passed to your children, the children have to sell the house if their income is not eligible for the scheme.'",
  "df088680bd068fcf5c4372edc25a9646b967d1359b549773e37c6774": "Elon Musk on Monday accused a MSNBC host of 'basically saying Republicans are Nazis,' after the anchor, Mehdi Hasan, warned that Musk's plan to give the left and right an equal platform on Twitter was dangerous. Musk, 50, on April 25 reached an agreement with Twitter's board to buy the company for $44 billion. He said he was motivated by a wish to restore Twitter as a place for the free exchange of ideas, and has repeatedly said he wants to move away from 'censorship' and err on the side of free speech. His critics fear that this will result in an explosion of hate speech. Hasan, 43, on Sunday told viewers of his show: 'It's easy in American discourse to talk simplistically about the far-left and the far-right as two equally dangerously fringe boxes. 'Elon Musk has done it plenty of times just in the past week. 'But here's the difference. America's far-left wants to give us free health care and free childcare. America's far-right wants to give us white supremacy and no democracy. 'And this asymmetrical polarization of U.S. politics would be laughable if it went so horrifying.' Hasan said the United States was 'living through an unspeakably dangerous moment,' noting that 'the pro-QAnon, pro neo-Nazi faction of the Republican party is poised to expand dramatically' in November's midterms. He added: 'We're just two years away from Donald Trump, very possibly, re-seizing executive power.' Hasan said that, if Trump wins re-election in 2024, Musk's purchase of Twitter could be seen as 'a pivotal moment'. It would be seen, he continued, as the moment: 'When a petulant and not so bright billionaire casually bought one of the world's most influential messaging machines and just handed it to the far-right.' Musk on Monday was unimpressed by Hasan's critique. 'NBC basically saying Republicans are Nazis,' he tweeted in a thread. 'Same org that covered up Hunter Biden laptop story, had Harvey Weinstein story early & killed it & built Matt Lauer his rape office. Lovely people.' Hasan replied: 'Dear @elonmusk, free speech doesn't mean you can just put words in my mouth. 'I'm not 'basically saying' Republicans are Nazis, watch the clip: I'm calling out groups of House Republicans who attend conferences with neo-Nazis and echo their Nazi rhetoric. 'Should I not? Don't you?' He then invited Musk onto his show. 'Instead of replying to right-wing, bad-faith Twitter accounts that selectively clip the words of liberals and leftists, and in this case prompt you to then distort my words, why not come on my show and do a robust interview with me on your views on free speech?' When Musk failed to reply, Hasan tried again. 'So what say you @elonmusk?' he tweeted. 'Rather than take softballs on the TED stage, why not come on my show and have a robust discussion with me about the nature and scope of free speech in America? 'Is there anything more pro-free speech than a good-faith, informed public debate?' Musk on Monday night was at the Met Gala in New York City - his first public outing since sealing the deal to buy Twitter. He was asked by La La Anthony, interviewing guests as they arrive, about his plans for Twitter. 'My goal, assuming everything gets done, is to make Twitter as inclusive as possible and to have as broad a swathe of people on Twitter as possible,' he said. 'And that it is entertaining and funny and they have as much fun as possible.' Hours before the gala began, it emerged that Musk is in talks with large investment firms and high net-worth individuals about taking on more financing for his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter and tying up less of his wealth in the deal, Reuters reported. Musk is the world's richest person, with Forbes estimating his net worth at about $245 billion.  Yet most of his wealth is tied up in the shares of Tesla, the electric car maker he leads.  Last week, Musk disclosed he sold $8.5 billion worth of Tesla stock following his agreement to buy Twitter. The new financing, which could come in the form of preferred or common equity, could reduce the $21 billion cash contribution that Musk has committed to the deal as well as a margin loan he secured against his Tesla shares, the sources said. The banks that agreed last month to provide $13 billion in loans based on Twitter's business balked at offering more debt for Musk's acquisition given the San Francisco-based company's limited cash flow, Reuters reported last month. Musk has also pledged some of his Tesla shares to banks to arrange a $12.5 billion margin loan to help fund the deal.  Investors have been fretting over whether Musk will complete the Twitter deal given that he has backtracked in the past.  In April, he decided at the last minute not to take up a seat on Twitter's board.  In 2018, Musk tweeted that there was 'funding secured' for a $72 billion deal to take Tesla private but did not move ahead with an offer. Twitter shares ended trading up 0.2% at $49.14 in New York on Monday, closer to the $54.20 per share acquisition price, as investors interpreted the news on the new financing discussions as making it slightly more likely that the deal will close. Musk would have to pay a $1 billion termination fee to Twitter if he walked away, and the social media company could also sue him to complete the deal. Musk, who calls himself a free speech absolutist, has criticized Twitter's moderation policies.  He wants Twitter's algorithm for prioritizing tweets to be public and objects to giving too much power on the service to corporations that advertise.",
  "e25ef54ae769c27930e60096ed9133b7657586caafdbfa0b827b3797": "The Queen made an extraordinary personal intervention with ministers in order to prevent her cousin being kidnapped by the IRA, a new book reveals. In 1971, the Duke of Kent, an Army officer with the Royal Scots Greys, was sent to Northern Ireland with his unit. However, the former Northern Ireland prime minister, Lord O'Neil received a warning that the IRA were planning to kidnap the then 35-year-old Duke when his unit entered Belfast. The peer passed the message on to the Queen via her private secretary. She, in turn alerted Prime Minister Edward Heath during her private audience and he relayed a warning to his ministers. Commanding officers were then told, very clearly, that the Duke was not to be sent to Belfast without special orders. A few weeks later, the Duke was posted back to the mainland. The revelation appears in Queen of Our Times: The Life of Elizabeth II by Robert Hardman who discovered the secret correspondence in the National Archives. He quotes the Ministry of Defence official, A.W. Stephens, who informed the Prime Minister's private secretary, Robert Armstrong, on February 11: 'The Queen's wish that the Duke should not be sent into Belfast has been carefully noted.' Mr Hardman said: 'This was a time when kidnappings were on the up - a British diplomat had been kidnapped by separatists in Quebec months earlier - and the Queen was clearly worried enough about the credibility of this rumour that she intervened with the PM. 'Though she has always been very loyal to her cousins - and they to her - this would not have been a case of special treatment. 'When it came to the Falklands, for example, the Queen was adamant that Prince Andrew should not receive special treatment. She would have been more concerned that the Duke of Kent's presence was a danger to his men.' The Royal family - including the Queen - have been a target for the IRA. The organisation claimed responsibility for the 1979 murder of Lord Louis Mountbatten, 79, second cousin of the Queen and great-uncle of Prince Charles. The World War II hero and last viceroy of India was aboard his 29-foot Shadow V fishing boat with six others near his summer home in northwest Ireland the morning of the attack. The IRA were also said to be behind a failed bomb attempt to assassinate the Queen in 1981 when she opened a giant new oil terminal at Sullom Voe in Shetland. The IRA made it clear they regarded the Royal Family as 'legitimate targets' during the Queen's Silver Jubilee visit to Northern Ireland in August 1977, warning that they would give her a 'jubilee bomb blitz to remember'. The revelation over the Duke of Kent coincides with the announcement that the Duke has become the latest member of the Royal Family to write his memoirs. While the Royal Family await this autumn's publication of Prince Harry's memoirs with dread, it is understood that they are entirely happy with the forthcoming book, A Royal Life, which the Duke has written with the historian, Hugo Vickers. It includes his memories of his father's death during the Second World War, of being bullied at prep school and of his nerves at taking part in the Coronation. The Duke, who has recorded memories of his unusual life for posterity, has offered a glimpse of the Royal family at play, from the Queen and Princess Margaret as young sisters to the Queen and Prince Philip enjoying a casual lunch at Balmoral in his book A Royal Life. Known as Prince Edward before he inherited the title aged six on the death of his father, the Duke has had a ringside seat to royal history for his 86 years. He is first cousin to the Queen, related through their fathers, and his book promises 'unique insights, with photographs from the Duke's personal collection'.",

The ex-Labor leader said reports Tanya Plibersek had been sidelined by Mr Albanese because she might steal his limelight were a 'storm in a teacup'.  Ms Plibersek has been conspicuously absent from appearances alongside Mr Albanese and has had only one official transcript released to the media in the election campaign. 'Sorry, Albo is threatened by Tanya. It is very, very clear,' Today Show reporter Chris O'Keefe pressed. 'Just like you Bill were threatened by Albo back in 2019. You know how it works!' Mr Shorten tried to brush off the comments saying 'Australia is a big place' and Labor MPs just happened to be campaigning in different regions to Mr Albanese. 'Nobody here is believing that you guys are sitting at the coalface and just chipping away at votes in your electorate. Please!' Mr O'Keefe interrupted. 'This is politics. It is an election.'  'Albo is looking over his shoulder at Tania going, I hope this election goes well and Tanya is sitting there doing the numbers about what will happen if it doesn't go well.' 'She will be the leader of the Labor Party. We all know that, Bill. Stop pulling our leg!' A clearly irked Mr Shorten then fired back that the claims were 'sensationalist' and he was 'calling it out'.  'You want to get the punch in and the boxing gloves on. Good on you, son,' Mr Shorten said. 'Maybe go and do some boxercise. We'll get you down to class and you can work it out of your system'. Deputy Labor leader Ms Plibersek is the MP for Sydney while Mr Albanese is the MP for the neighbouring seat of Grayndler in Sydney's inner-west.  Both are from the left faction of Labor and had been considered for the party's leadership back in 2019 after their election loss.  Ms Plibersek quickly pulled out of contention, leaving Mr Albanese to duke it out with right faction hopefuls Chris Bowen and Richard Marles.  Back then Ms Plibersek said she had 'support, from across the party, to be elected leader' but the move would have required too much time away from her family.  She added she was was 'overwhelmed by the confidence my colleagues, the union movement, and Labor party members have placed in me'. While she hasn't appeared with Mr Albanese at any high profile events during this election campaign she has made media appearances on her own, including on The Project on this week. ",
  "90e5322f7e8a3573f1eb4bf384af5454891d9faa31b9d2187af0b986": "Prime Minister Scott Morrison has rejected suggestions an interest rate hike could hurt him on polling day, saying Australians understand the impact of global inflationary pressures. The Reserve Bank of Australia could hike the cash interest rate on Tuesday for the first time in 12 years after inflation in March surged to a 21-year high of 5.1 per cent. A May rate rise would also be the first during an election campaign since November 2007, when former PM John Howard lost power. Mr Morrison, who will start the day campaigning in Melbourne, said voters will back the party they believe are better economic managers. 'They know there are (inflation) pressures that are coming from outside of Australia on interest rates,' he said on Monday. Asked if rising rates could damage the coalition's chances at the federal election on May 21, Mr Morrison accused journalists of looking through a 'totally political lens'. 'I don't. And Australians don't,' he said. 'Australians are focused on what they are paying for and who they think is going to be best able to manage an economy and manage the finances, so they are in the best possible position to realise their aspirations.' Finance Minister Simon Birmingham has also played down the potential political damage from a possible rate hike, and said the cash rate was coming off an 'abnormally low' base of 0.1 per cent. 'I don't think that Australians expected interest rates to stay at historically low 0.1 per cent levels forever,' he told the Nine Network on Tuesday. 'In fact, that is no doubt why so many Australians chose to lock in fixed rates.' Mr Birmingham stressed the upward pressure on interest rates was 'overwhelmingly being driven at least by international factors', rather than government policy. 'It's important that they [the RBA] apply the monetary policy settings in an independent way and in a way that acts in concert with what we've been doing in relation to fiscal policy,' he said. Financial markets have priced in a 0.15 percentage point rise in the cash rate to 0.25 per cent on Tuesday, ahead of more expected increases of 0.25 percentage points in subsequent months. But some economists think the RBA may not act until next month. Opposition Treasury spokesman Jim Chalmers said Australians were facing a 'full-blown cost of living crisis and Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg haven't got a plan beyond the election'. 'Scott Morrison's failures have dealt Australians a triple whammy of skyrocketing costs of living, falling real wages, and now interest rate rises either this week or next month,' he said. 'When things are going well in the economy Scott Morrison takes all the credit, but when Australians are doing it tough he takes none of the responsibility.' Labor leader Anthony Albanese will start Tuesday in Sydney. Meanwhile, Seven Network has secured the third and final leaders' debate, which will be broadcast on May 11 and moderated by the channel's political editor Mark Riley. Mr Morrison and Mr Albanese will square off at the second election debate on the Nine Network on Sunday.",
  "3a36002e3e12274cfe21e0d6df74a22d20201b665ff36c859e34ac1f": "The Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim, California is paying one woman $100,000 to settle her lawsuit claiming that she was bitten by bed bugs during her stay and suffered a serious rash as a result. Dr. Ivy Eldridge claimed in her 2018 lawsuit that she suffered physical and emotional damage after waking up with bedbug bites during her stay at the Disneyland Hotel in April of that year. She accused the hotel staff of knowing that it had a bedbug issue and failing to notify her about the infestation prior to her stay, according to the suit filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court. The lawsuit also notes that Eldridge, a vice principal at a Riverside, California, school, 'endured many sleepless nights and much emotional and mental distress, coupled with other physical conditions associated with severe mental and emotional distress.' She claimed she received costly medical treatment after developing a rash over her entire body when the bugs 'sucked her blood until they were gorged,' and had to take time off of work to endure these treatments. Photos included in the lawsuit showed welts and bite marks on Eldridge's shoulders, neck back and ears.  Now, four years later, TMZ reports, the Disneyland Hotel has agreed to pay Eldridge $100,000 for the damages she incurred. Her attorney, Brian Virag from the firm MyBedBugLawyer, Inc., claimed at the time that the hotel 'did not provide a bedbug-free hotel room.' He called the Disneyland Hotel's response to the bedbugs 'so extreme and outrageous as to go beyond all bounds of decency.'  Virag also noted in the lawsuit that this was not the first time a Disney resort had dealt with bedbugs. In 2016, Disney's Grand Californian Hotel&Spa was sued over bedbug problems.  Virag said the issue should have been resolved by the time Eldridge checked in with her family at the Disneyland Hotel. At the time, though, Disneyland spokesperson Liz Jaeger said 'these occurrences are extremely rare.' 'We take extensive preventative measures so that our guests are comfortable and safe during their hotel stays and when needed take aggressive steps to rectify,' Jaeger told the Los Angeles Times. But as Virag told TMZ following the news of the settlement: 'Bedbugs don't discriminate; they are found in hotels of all quality levels throughout the country and worldwide.'",

Oksana, 23, was walking alongside her husband Viktor in their home town of Lysychansk in the Russian-occupied Luhansk region on March 27 when she stepped on a mine. The couple were returning home 'along a familiar path', according to the Lviv medical association, when Oksana took one fateful step and was caught in a horrific blast just a split second later. Viktor was not injured, but Oksana had both of her legs and four fingers on her left hand blown away in the explosion. Miraculously, the young nurse survived, and after four operations to stabilise her injuries was evacuated west towards the city of Dnipro, before arriving in Lviv by train four days ago to be fitted with prosthetics. Upon arriving in Lviv, the pair, who have two children, decided to tie the knot. The beautiful footage, captured by a nurse, showed Viktor holding Oksana aloft in a warm embrace as the couple twirled gently around the hospital room to the applause of happy onlookers. Ukraine's parliament shared the wonderful news via their official Twitter account, posting footage of the couple's first dance as husband and wife and wishing them future happiness. The tweet described Oksana and Viktor's wedding as the culmination of 'a very special love story' and wished the couple 'happiness and long years together'. 'Life should not be postponed until later, decided Oksana and Victor, who in six years together never found time for marriage,' the Lviv medical association said. The association told Sky News they bought wedding rings in Lviv, found Oksana a white dress, and enjoyed a wedding cake baked by volunteers at the hospital.  Their wedding celebration took place on the ward of the surgery centre ahead of Oksana's preparations to be fitted with prosthetic limbs and begin learning how to walk again.  Oksana is now preparing to travel to Germany with her husband for further treatment. Their wedding dance is the latest in a string of touching clips of Ukrainians expressing their love for each other in the midst of war. Footage released in early April captured the inspiring moment a Ukrainian soldier proposed to his girlfriend next to a pile of sandbags on the streets of war-torn Odesa. The hero husband-to-be got down on one knee before his flabbergasted girlfriend, whose shock suddenly turned to joy as she realised exactly what was going on. The soldier produced a ring from his fatigues, which caused the young woman to cover her mouth with both hands before shrieking and saying 'YES!', the viral TikTok shows.  After placing the ring on his fiancee's finger, which fitted perfectly, the husband to be watched on as his girlfriend celebrated her good fortune with a fist pump.  He then brought a huge bouquet of flowers to top it all off. Though the couple's names are unknown, the heartwarming clip has clearly touched a nerve, gaining 850,000 views and 179,000 within just a few hours of being posted. Supportive comments, mostly in Ukrainian, saw well-wishers hoping the soldier stays safe during the war. One user wrote: 'Awww so sweet, live long and happy!'  Another added: May you be safe and victorious! Congratulations!'",
  "08c8d601413dccaf997ce9e1d2c42f436fc3057fa9baa51419259a45": "Primary school students have been urged to 'ditch the ham sandwich' in leaflets inserted in their newsletters and send home to parents.   Leaflets from the Cancer Council telling kids to stop eating ham sandwiches have been put into public school newsletters by teachers in NSW. 'Ditch the ham sandwich' is the Cancer Council's latest anti-meat edict and follows on from a previous leaflet telling children to have a 'meat-free Monday'. But both parents and pork producers have defended the humble ham sandwich and railed against the 'politically correct message'. However, Channel Nine's US. correspondent, Amelia Adams, admitted she 'wasn't surprised'.  'It's such a nanny state back there,' she told Karl Stefanovic during a Today show cross on Tuesday morning. A pork company owner said the Cancer Council leaflets go 'too far'. 'Ham is actually a product which has been developed over the last 5,000 years and people have eaten it through the ages without any problems,' David Bligh of Bringelly Pork and Bacon told News Corp. 'I think sometimes these politically correct messages can go a little bit too far and not be as practical as they should be.' A Cancer Council spokeswoman said the leaflets are part of a health campaign to get children eating better food.  'Because there is strong evidence that eating processed meats and too much red meat is associated with increased risk of bowel cancer, our cancer prevention messages advise everyone to limit their processed meat consumption and cut down on red meat,' she said. She added that schools sent the messages to include with material sent home with pupils, were not under any obligation to do so. The NSW Department of Education eased fears of parents confirming no public school had banned ham sandwiches.  Earlier this year, an Australian mum was criticised by other parents for one part of the contents in her son's school lunchbox. Tara was happy with the lunch she prepared for her child, which included a sandwich, yoghurt, grapes, biscuits with Vegemite, popcorn and red pickled onions. But after sharing an image to the Aldi Mums Facebook group, the ham, cheese and mayonnaise sandwich was quickly critiqued by others. One mum questioned whether the ham sandwich was safe during Australia's hot summer, as it could lead to 'food poisoning' if left in the child's bag until lunchtime. Tara quickly responded and said she puts an ice pack alongside the lunchbox to keep the food chilled, claiming it's 'usually still cold' after school.  For Tara, and a great many others, the humble ham sandwich will remain a school lunchbox favourite for a long time to come. The word ham derives from the Old English ham and refers specifically to a cut of meat from the hog's hind legs.  China takes credit for curing the first pork leg back in 4900 BC.  Enthusiasm for ham spread throughout ancient Europe with the Romans, who probably learned of the practice while trading with the Chinese.  Modern methods of curing bacon were invented in the mid-19th century by Irish man Henry Denny. He began to cure bacon using ice in 1854. It made the bacon more palatable by using far less salt for preservation.   Source: The Spruce Eats and Let's Look Again",

  "9902a425570c837a7bde051e9acbb500d042c43e30a279ab43b69497": "A Utah gynecologist is being sued by 83 different women who claimed he sexually abused and battered them over the course of 40 years.  Dr. David H. Broadbent, 74, faces a civil suit from dozens of anonymous women regarding his work at his practice in Provo, a college town 45 miles south of Salt Lake City.  The allegations, which span four decades, included that he abused and battered women while examining them and preyed upon them for sexual pleasure, even moaning while doing it some cases. The women suing in Utah's 4th District said they felt 'ashamed', 'disgusted' and 'vulnerable' according to the suit.   One of the Jane Does, who goes by H.P., resembles many of the plaintiffs' experience: She claims Broadbent, during an appointment in July 2020, pulled her by the legs without warning her in a sexual manner and then inserted a speculum.   According to H.P., he quickly removed the medical device and had only his fingers inside of her.  'Dr. David H. Broadbent took advantage of his position, Plaintiffs' vulnerability, and that relationship of trust as he sexually battered and abused Plaintiffs and numerous other women over the course of four decades,' the suit claims.  This Jane Doe had little experience with gynecological exams and zero context for what Broadbent had done, so she continued seeing him at least two more times, when his behavior persisted, including mocking vaginal exams as he performed them.  Broadbent also joked that H.P. had not suffered a miscarriage when she actually had. Nurses apparently knew about Broadbent's behavior, but did not interfere, the lawsuit claims.  The first time any of the victims realized the scope and length of Broadbent's alleged misconduct was in 2021, when a patient told a doctor on a podcast about what he had done, leading to a wave of women from across the state who had experienced similar things.      One patient alleges Broadbent unnecessarily 'manually remove[d] her placenta' after giving birth, which caused her 'extreme pain.' Another claims he joked that she must be a virgin based on how she responded to his touch. Many of the victims claim that the nurses did not get in his way, with one merely rolling her eyes.    His treatment was so bad that, when in 2010 a patient was scheduled to deliver a baby with him, she screamed 'don't let him touch me!'  The lawsuit was filed against Broadbent in February with just four plaintiffs, with 46 more Jane Does joining shortly after.  A second, 'sister' suit was filed Tuesday, listing 33 more women who say they were patients between 1979 and 2022.   David C. Epperson, a lawyer representing Broadbent, has said the allegations are bogus.    'Dr. Broadbent categorically denies all of the allegations of wrongdoing that are asserted in this lawsuit,' Epperson said in a March statement. 'Medical ethics prevent Dr. Broadbent from saying anything more, but he believes that time will prove that the charges in this lawsuit have no basis.' Broadbent, the Utah Valley Hospital and Intermountain Healthcare are the defendants in the case. They have all asked a judge to dismiss the suit and argue plaintiffs should file their complaints via a state malpractice law.   The firm, Gross & Rooney, who represent the Jane Does, said their reasoning is incorrect because 'sexual abuse is not health care' and Broadbent's alleged acts are 'deserving of an orange jumpsuit, not the protection of a white coat.'",

The shop attendant could be heard on the radio calling out 'code 99 in aisle one', shorthand for a robbery in progress.  In footage posted to Reddit, it could be seen how two of the perpetrators were women while the third suspect was a man.  One of the participants could be seen in the restricted area behind the cash register as she grabbed what appeared to be nicotine patches and Nicorette gum from the shelves.  The other pair were seen filling bags that were worn over their shoulders before racing out of the store.  Shoppers could do nothing but stand around in disbelief as the team simply filled their bags before making a clean getaway.  On the way out of the door, the shop associate called out 'Get a job!' 'F**k you you piece of s**t!' came the response as the male robber run out the door.  It is the latest in a string of shocking shoplifting outrages to hit the famously liberal Bay Area. Last month a man was seeing cruising the ailes of a CVS Pharmacy also in San Francisco stuffing items into a rollaboard suitcase.  The frustration was felt by viewers of the video online. 'Some people will do what they can get away with. Does raise the question: how much theft can a store absorb and still stay open?' asked one user. 'The only occasion these people will be willing to wear their masks,' added another  'I wasn't even physically there and I feel very awkward,' wrote one Redditor.  'In SF there's zero risk of going to jail or even being put on probation. The DA can not prosecute any thefts under $950, and even if it goes above that the DA in SF doesn't care,' explained one viewer.  The scene is similar to those seen across the country from New York to Los Angeles and beyond, with thieves undeterred as they take whatever they like from the shelves.  But San Francisco and its Bay Area neighbors have been hit hard by a wave of property crimes and smash-and-grab robberies since the start of the pandemic.  Lax bail reform laws in often-liberal cities mean there is virtually no penalty for the thieves who carry out the crimes. Without any threat of a jail sentence, the crooks are released back out onto the streets and able to reoffend - often on the same day of their original arrest.  Earlier in the year, the West Coast was the scene of a spate of high-end luxury robberies with thieves targeting boutiques where designer goods were sold.  It even involved getaway drivers waiting outside department stores while their accomplices pulled what they could from the shelves inside.  The pharmacy robberies are a much lower-end version of the heists but ultimately it is the consumer that ends up paying with stores forced to increase their prices due to inventory constantly being stolen and shoplifted from their own stores.  The video is also extremely similar to those which have been shot in the past and see thieves lining their pockets with whatever they desire with no resistance from either store staff or fellow shoppers whatsoever. Drug store chains like Walgreens and CVS have become attractive and easy targets for shoplifters, leading to numerous store closures in the Bay Area. In the area's largest city, San Francisco, low-level offenses, such as retail thefts, have been effectively de-criminalized under the leadership of progressive District Attorney Chesa Boudin. Boudin, who in a recent interview with the New York Times argued that tough-on-crime policies do not work and blamed the police for the San Francisco's soaring crime rates, is facing a recall vote on June 7.  Walgreens said last year that retail theft in San Francisco was five times the chain average and security costs were 46 times the chain average, reported San Francisco Chronicle.   According to the latest available crime data, grand larceny rates in California's liberal bastion were up 26 per cent in mid-April, compared with the same period last year.  California Gov Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, has vowed to crack down on gangs of retail thieves, despite a controversial 2014 law - Proposition 47 - that barred prosecutors from charging suspected shoplifters accused of stealing less than $950 worth of merchandise with felonies.  Similar thefts have been taking place across the country in New York with thieves hitting the same Upper East Side Rite Aid for months, forcing it to close. A Rite Aid store, located at the corner of 80th Street and 2nd Avenue,  in one of New York City's wealthiest neighborhoods,  shut its doors for good on February 15 a day after a thief was caught on video boldly sauntering out with shopping bags full of stolen goods. The Rite Aid's closure is just one of many in the city. On February 8, a Hell's Kitchen store which had been rife with robberies also closed. On the Upper West Side, another store which experienced daily thefts shut down last November.  The chain announced last year that it was shutting down about 63 stores across the US in the next few years, citing cost-cutting measures to save $25 million a year - but workers say that the thefts are part of the reason for the closures as inventory dwindles.

The nine-year-old was riding with his mother when he hit a kerb in the town of Collie in Western Australia's south-west on Sunday afternoon. The boy, who was wearing a helmet at the time, was rushed to hospital with critical injuries but sadly couldn't be revived. The tragedy has rocked the close-knit community as the boy's schoolmates returned to the classroom for the start of term two on Monday. 'Any little boy is precious in our community and if we lose one of them it's just tragic for the whole community, let alone how the family are feeling,' Collie deputy shire president Ian Miffling told Nine News. 'I mean it's tragic for the family.' Floral tributes have been placed at the crash scene. Authorities are investigating whether the boy suffered a medical episode before falling off his bike.  Major Crash Investigation officers travelled from Perth to examine the scene and have ruled out foul play. No other vehicle was involved in the 'tragic incident'. 'He had a good bike and good helmet, everything was going correct,' Superintendent Martin Voyez said. 'When he hit the kerb, and for reasons we are not yet sure of, [he] passes away. 'It was a local family and that makes it all the worse. 'It's absolutely terrible, these things break your heart.'  A report will be prepared for the Coroner. ",

Videos posted online show the man and woman arguing with a steward aboard a JetBlue flight departing from West Palm Beach, Florida as she claimed her fellow passengers were 'f******.' 'You don't like the words coming out of my mouth,' the woman - who has not yet been identified - could be seen telling a steward, before yelling: 'No words, no words, free speech is dead.' At that point, the steward tells the woman she and her husband are 'definitely coming off,' to which the woman replies, 'No, we're not coming off' insinuating that if he forces them off the plans 'then you're going to have to take everyone off. 'This is ridiculous,' she says, asking her fellow passengers: 'Do you guys see what is happening in America. 'He didn't like what we said, and now we're getting kicked off of a plane, and all of y'all are going to have to wait. 'This is f****** outrageous,' she continues, adding: 'You guys, we're going to turn into China, it's coming.' She then calls her fellow passengers 'sheep,' and makes baaing noises. Throughout the woman's three-minute long tirade, her husband does not say much and slurred his words when he did.  At another point in the video posted online, the woman says she loves Elon Musk, saying 'he's the best,' before screaming the billionaire's name. 'He's the f****** king, because the masked people in our row are kicking us off the plane.' She then continued to say she planned to sue the airline and her fellow passengers - asking another man at the edge of the frame what his name is. The man then replies: 'I guarantee I have more money than you, you're a f****** jerkoff. The woman then seems to get offended, claiming she 'used to dance on Broadway, I'm not getting that f****** vaccine. 'We did nothing,' she again claimed, before insinuating that the United States is going to turn into 'Shanghai.' Later, a man could be seen trying to escort her husband off the flight, as she yells: 'Gene, we're not getting off. 'Excuse me, it's our anniversary,' the woman tells the flight crew, at which point her husband interjects: 'I'm retired FBI, I know my rights.' But the JetBlue crew ultimately called in local law enforcement, at which point the woman claims: 'We're getting kicked off the plane because we're Trump supporters,' prompting another exasperated passenger to say: 'Don't do that.' By the time they were escorted off the flight, a second video showed, their fellow passengers booed them and yelled at them to 'move.'  It remains unclear what led up to the woman's tirade, but the person who posted it on Reddit claimed the couple was using various 'racist and homophobic' slurs, prompting a passenger to inform the flight crew. It also remains unclear if they are facing any charges.  DailyMail.com has reached out to JetBlue for comment. But this is just the latest incident of passengers becoming unruly on a plane since flights resumed following the heart of the pandemic as more people began to once again travel. In October, a male passenger allegedly punched a female flight attendant on an American Airlines flight from New York City to Orange County, California in a dispute over wearing his mask. That same month, another apparent anti-masker on a United Airlines flight screamed at a flight attendant and threatened fellow flyers when he was asked to put on his mask. At one point, the passenger even warned someone trying to diffuse the situation: 'I'll break your neck.' Then in December, a Delta flight from Washington to Los Angeles was diverted after a passenger attacked a steward and then turned on an Air Marshal. Most recently, a Southwest Airlines passenger was accused of pleasuring himself four times and exposing his privates to a woman on a two-and-a-half-hour flight from Seattle to Phoenix. Antonio Sherrodd McGarity was arrested last month, after Southwest Airlines Flight 3814 landed at Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix. He was taken into federal custody on suspicion of lewd, indecent or obscene acts on an aircraft - a charge that carries a sentence of up to 90 days in prison. During an interview with the FBI, McGarity allegedly admitted to masturbating on the plane, and he dismissed the entire episode involving the female passenger who witnessed his sexually explicit display as being 'kind of kinky.' 'McGarity admitted to law enforcement that he had masturbated during his flight from Seattle, Washington, to Phoenix, Arizona, and that he had an orgasm,' according to the criminal complaint.  The Federal Aviation Administration has tried to clamp down on the influx of unruly passengers, imposing a zero-tolerance mandate for bad behavior after it escalated following the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol.  Incidents remained elevated after President Joe Biden's administration imposed a mandate requiring passengers to wear masks on airplanes and in airports because of COVID-19 cases in February 2021.  The FAA said since January 2021, there have been a record 7,060 unruly passenger incidents reported - and 70% involved masking rules - but the rate has declined 60% since its high in 2021. The FAA said in February it has referred 80 unruly airplane passengers to the FBI for potential criminal prosecution. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has now warned airline passengers not to be a 'jerk.' 'Look. It's one thing to be grumpy on a flight. I feel that way sometimes,' Buttigieg in an appearance on ABC's The View last month. 'But yeah, it's another thing to endanger flight crews and to endanger fellow passengers. We have no tolerance for that. The FAA is actually getting ready to announce record fines on people who have done this.'  'If you're on an airplane, don't be a jerk,' he advised. 'Don't endanger your fellow passengers.' 'The bottom line is if you're on an airplane, and you endanger flight crews and fellow passengers, you may be referred for criminal prosecution as well, and you might lose the privilege of flying on that airline, period,' Buttigieg said. He added at the time that the Biden administration is still looking at creating a 'no-fly' list for unruly passengers, after several Democratic members of Congress introduced legislation that would create a list for 'violent offenders convicted of assaulting flight crew -- including flight attendants, pilots, and crew members.' Unions representing flight attendants have voiced support for the legislation.",
  "180aebd747c8940631b7949cdceb3373155fa1268bf9e673e4ef2cb0": "In her first speech since announcing an upcoming trip to meet Ukrainian refugees in Europe, First Lady Dr. Jill Biden on Monday sharply condemned 'Putin's war' and shared praise for the 'resilience' of those affected by Russia's brutal invasion. The first lady was at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Hours later, dozens of celebrities and other elites will descend on the space for this year's annual Met Gala.  Biden was invited by Vogue editor Anna Wintour to deliver remarks at the unveiling of this year's Met Gala costume exhibit, In America: An Anthology of Fashion. 'Style helps us express things that can't be put into words,' she said at the high-fashion event. The English professor and first lady revealed she had that sentiment in mind in the lead up to her husband's State of the Union address at the beginning of March. 'A few months ago, as the President was preparing for the State of the Union address, my mind was a world away,' Biden said.  'Like so many Americans, I was transfixed by the news of Ukraine, the bombings, the parents weeping over their children's broken bodies in the streets.' 'As the State of the Union approached, I knew the only thing that would be reported about me was what I was wearing.' And so that led Biden to have a small fabric sunflower -- the national flower of Ukraine -- sewn onto her 'deep cobalt-blue' dress 'And that night, sitting next to the Ukrainian ambassador, I knew I was sending a message without saying a word: that Ukraine was in our hearts--and that we stood with them,' she said. Biden will come face-to-face with Ukrainian refugees who fled Russia's invasion this weekend, spending Mother's Day with a few of the millions who have been displaced since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. 'Earlier today, I announced that, at the end of this week, I'll be headed to Romania and Slovakia to visit our troops and spend Mother's Day with Ukrainian families who've been displaced by Putin's war,' the first lady said. 'As a mother myself, I can only imagine the grief families are feeling. I know that we might not share a language, but I hope that I can convey, in ways so much greater than words, that their resilience inspires me, that they are not forgotten, and that all Americans stand with them still.' The first lady will be in Romania on May 6 and 7 where she'll meet with American service members stationed there, representatives of Romanian government, US embassy staff as well as aid workers and educators working with Ukrainian refugees. On Sunday she'll meet with embassy staff, humanitarian workers and refugees in Slovakia. Before departing she'll meet with members of the Slovakian government on Monday. She concluded her remarks at the Met with, 'As we celebrate the designers and the fashion that has shaped the very identity of America, I hope it will inspire all of us to keep learning.' 'I hope it will help us to see the beauty and art that surrounds us every day. And most importantly, I hope it will remind us to be bold and brave.' The packed room stood up to give Biden a standing ovation at the end of her speech.  Even before celebrities pack the museum for their extravagant party, artists and VIPs like Instagram head Adam Mosseri and the platform's director of fashion partnerships Eva Chen gathered in the Met's Charles Engelhard Court for the first lady's opening remarks. Mosseri is one of the Met Gala's co-hosts this year along with Wintour.  An entourage including Wintour and Met interns then accompanied Biden on a private tour of the exhibit, which this year includes historical artifacts like the jacket George Washington wore to his inauguration and the clothing Abraham Lincoln was assassinated in. Mannequins are posed in scenes depicting American fashion through the years, having been created by the likes of Tom Ford, Martin Scorcese and Sofia Coppola. During her Monday speech, Biden wore a $2,900 Tom Ford dress. ",
  "490c6f0fed166ed5e46409d9f56010191acdf5e64502f5823ddce1e7": "A Nicaraguan man's tragic drowning was captured on camera Sunday - the result of a failed bid to illegally cross the Mexico-United States border. Calixto Rojas, 53, and his friend Elbe Castro, 42, were seen struggling to stay afloat as the Rio Grande's current picked up strength between Piedras Negras, Coahuila, and Eagle Pass, Texas. A Fox News camera crew spotted Castro hanging on to a concrete column in the middle of the river while Rojas battled the current and tried to keep his head above water. He later went under as Texas National Guard soldiers looked on. Rojas was swept down the international waterway and his body found near an islet further down the river. Castro somehow continued on and made it to a second set of concrete pillars under a bridge, where he sat on top of a tree branch.  U.S. Border Patrol contacted its Mexican counterparts, who rescued him and led him back to Mexico. The drowning took place nine days after Texas National Guardsman Bishop Evans, 22, died while attempting to rescue two migrants who were being swept by the Rio Grande's treacherous currents. One of the guardsmen who were on the Texas-side of the river told Fox News that they were instructed not to conduct any rescue missions involving individuals attempting to cross the Rio Grande. According to local Nicaraguan outlets, Rojas and Castro were among several migrants who each paid a woman $3,000 to taken to the Mexican border town of Piedras Negras and smuggled into the U.S. Rojas, a radio host back home, frequently penned letters to fill in Radio Dario with updates of what turned out to be an ill-fated journey to the U.S. border.  Rojas left his family behind in Nicaragua after he attended a demonstration denouncing the regime of President Daniel Ortega and immediately had his home attacked by supporters of the Sandinista National Liberation Front. 'They threatened me with death, that if I continued like this they would disappear me and my family,' he wrote. 'I had to make the hard decision to leave my family to save their lives, because when a Sandinista march was passing by made up of workers from the mayor's office, they pounced on my house throwing stones towards the roof, it was at that moment that in a consensus (decision) with my wife, I have to leave my house and therefore the country.' Rojas traveled through Honduras before crossing through El Salvador and then Guatemala.  He settled for a while in Belize where he claimed he was 'totally disoriented and lost. And this is where my suffering began.' Rojas share that he struggled to eat a healthy meal, often settling for fruits, oatmeal, bread and just about anything that was cheap and affordable.  He made ends meets performing random cleaning jobs until he overheard a man speaking about the radio station he owned.  The impromptu job interviewed led to a $12-a-day radio gig, money which was used fund his journey to the Mexican Caribbean coastal state of Quintana Roo, where he faced additional struggles prior to finally reaching the northern state of Coahuila, where death awaited him. 'May God continue to illuminate the path of all of us who fight and leave everything to see a Nicaragua without a dictatorship and emigrate aimlessly just to save our lives for one day to see the dictators defeated,' Rojas wrote.",

The Prime Minister took a break from the campaign trail on Sunday evening to cook up a storm for his wife Jenny and daughters Abbey and Lily - posting images to social media. He served up an exotic Sri Lankan tamarind eggplant and okra dish alongside steamed rice and a classic chicken korma with the cheeky caption: 'Strong Curry. Strong Economy. Stronger Future.' But eagle-eyed commenters said his family are also going to need 'strong stomachs' with a portion of the chicken korma appearing dangerously undercooked.  'Pray to god you do not get Salmonella eating the pink raw chicken. Eat Chicken responsibly,' one shocked person urged the PM. 'Be lucky to stay out of hospital,' another said. A third accused the PM of orchestrating a publicity stunt. 'Eeew that's raw chicken!... You didn't even bother cooking that did you? Just pour sauce over raw chicken for yet another photo op.' On Tuesday morning, Mr Morrison insisted the chicken was properly done.  'I can assure you, the chicken was cooked,' the PM responded.  His chicken curry post was trending second on Google in Australia for a brief moment earlier in the week.   But not everyone slammed Mr Morrison's skills in the kitchen.  Liberal MP Jason Wood gave the home-cooked meal a rave review.  'Looks amazing. I love cooking a chicken curry but alas yours is more impressive'.  Another wrote: 'You really love your curry. I love seeing each time you present your meals it's such a wonderful delight and how lucky is your family.' 'I love it that you cook curry! You're a legend, PM!' a third commented.",
  "2591a8b2bdd793983ad19e737ce8fcb9eb73667a96cc370cbc02b1ef": "The Russian army bombed a grain warehouse in Ukraine and tightened its blockade on Black Sea ports, sparking fears of a new global food crisis. Around 4.5million tonnes of grain are sitting in closed occupied Ukrainian ports, according to UN World Food Programme director Martin Frick. Mr Frick said: 'None of the grain can be used right now. It is just sitting there.'  Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky also warned Russia's blockade will deprive dozens of countries essential food supplies. It followed news that Putin's forces looted PS4million worth of Ukrainian tractors and took them 700 miles to Chechnya before realising they were locked. Shocking video of the grain attack in Synelnykove district, south-eastern Dnipropetrovsk region emerged earlier today.  Zelensky said: 'They targeted the warehouses of agricultural enterprises. The grain warehouse was destroyed.  'The warehouse with fertilizers was also shelled.' The president urged world leaders to prepare for a new food crisis prompted by Russia's food blockade on Ukraine.  He told 60 Minutes: 'Russia does not let ships come in or go out, it is controlling the Black Sea.  'Russia wants to completely block our country's economy.  'Ukraine could lose tens of millions of tonnes of grain due to Russia's blockade of its Black Sea ports.' Egypt and Tunisia import 80 per cent of their grain from Ukraine and Russia, while Lebanon purchases 60 per cent of its supplies from the two countries. Russian soldiers appear to be planning to extract more supplies from their own land with stolen Ukrainian equipment. But it has not all gone to plan. A fleet of 27 Ukrainian farm vehicles including combine harvesters and seeders were stolen from a tractor dealer in occupied Melitopol over a several week period. Their combined value totalled PS4million, with the harvesters going for PS240,00 each. But after loading the vehicles onto trucks and carrying them 700 miles to Chechnya, the Russian army realised they couldn't even use them. A source close to the dealer told CNN: 'When the invaders drove the stolen harvesters to Chechnya, they realized that they could not even turn them on, because the harvesters were locked remotely.' During his speech to the Irish parliament , Zelensky said Putin has targeted Ukraine's food supply in an effort to starve its people. 'For them, hunger is a weapon against us ordinary people as an instrument of domination', Zelensky added, in comments which may have been intended to reference Ireland's struggle with starvation in the 1840s. 'They are blocking humanitarian access to the half-million people in Mariupol who can no longer melt snow for water', he continued. He also told Italy's Chamber of Deputies in March that exports of grain and food products will be disrupted as Russia's invasion continues. 'The worst will be hunger, which is nearing for many countries . . . we do not know what harvest we will have and whether we will be able to export it. Prices are already surging.'",
  "47928eb5ba87e903e644d7f865c7faaf4152c15fc0ea31d2a912ec84": "The Block auctioneer Tom Panos claims many Australian real estate agents won't survive as rising interest rates sink the property market - with Sydney and Melbourne's home values already suffering their biggest falls in two years.  The Reserve Bank of Australia is widely expected to raise interest rates on Tuesday - the first increase in more than a decade - in an attempt to arrest surging inflation.  As rates rise, demand for property falls, leading to a reduction in real estate values. Speculation about higher borrowing costs is already denting Australia's biggest property markets.  Data from CoreLogic showed Sydney's median house price fell 0.1 per cent in April and by 0.3 per cent for the quarter to $1.417million, while in Melbourne prices fell 0.2 per cent in April and 0.5 per cent over three months to $1.001million  - the biggest drops since the Covid pandemic lockdowns in 2020. Mr Panos warned that he is already seeing property values drop 'in real time' - with homes that would sell for $3million already selling for $2.5million.  'The drop is happening,' he told Daily Mail Australia.  The property expert warned that a rise in interest rates could also be bad news for two groups of people: mortgage-holders, should interest rates start to soar; and those he calls 'real estate backpackers', people in the industry for short term gain. For customers, Mr Panos said as rates go up, fewer people will be borrowing less money, which will see prices for vendors decrease.  'You'll also see as rates go up, which is forecast to two per cent, that's when you cop it as a customer,' Mr Panos said. 'You'd have been on a low rate, but as rates go up, you're in for really big payments.'  For real estate agents as a whole, the shift could send some agents packing.   'Real estate has a low barrier to entry. You could be sweeping the streets, go off and do a short course, and you have the qualifications to be in real estate,' he said. 'When the market gets good, people get attracted to real estate; to the flash cars and Hugo Boss suits. But when the market changes they run for cover.' Mr Panos said he had a strong sense for 'commission breath' when working with new agents, adding he won't work with people he thinks are only in it for short-term money. 'They were always real estate backpackers. They want to go in and make short-term money,' he said.  'I can smell very quickly if they've got 'commission breath' and they're only focused on how soon and how much money can they can make. I dismiss them.' The auctioneer for The Block, who has worked in the industry for 35 years, said 'solid agents' should see their market share grow because they have long-term goals and stability that 'Instagram agents' don't have. 'It's like Warren Buffet said: 'Only when the tide goes out do you discover who's been swimming naked',' he said.

The downturns were the steepest since the era before the Reserve Bank slashed the cash rate to a record-low of 0.1 per cent.  But with inflation surging by 5.1 per cent in the year to March - the fastest annual pace since mid-2001 - the Reserve Bank is widely expected to raise interest rates on Tuesday. Three of Australia's Big Four banks - ANZ, Westpac and NAB - are expecting a May rate rise, which would be the first from the RBA since November 2010.  Someone buying a $1million house with a 20 per cent deposit would owe the bank $800,000 as a new borrower. A small 0.15 percentage point rate rise, as predicted by the banks, would see monthly repayments climb by $62 to $3,137 as the cash rate rose to 0.25 per cent. However, the banks are also expecting a series of rate rises in the year ahead. The RBA last month predicted a cash rate increase to 2 per cent would cause a 15 per cent plunge in property prices.  A series of rate rises to that level means a borrower with an $800,000 mortgage would see their monthly mortgage repayments surge by $833 to $3,908 as a typical variable rate rose from 2.29 per cent to 4.19 per cent. Last week, Mr Panos said such a downturn would mean a lot of agents would be forced to go back to their former jobs. 'The KFC managers are going to leave real estate and head back to KFC,' the real estate guru said. 'And you know who's going to stay behind - professionals, people who are going to know how to negotiate, and create urgency, where there is no urgency.' Mr Panos said the market has already started to dive and that forecasts from the banks are as much as two months behind the current reality. 'I see the numbers on the day. We're seeing something that was listed for $3million sell for $2.5million. I can see the drop happening,' he warned. 'They're reporting things that are months behind. The market has already dropped between five and 10 per cent.' He said as rates go up, less people will be borrowing less money, which will see prices for vendors decrease.

'Historically it was easy to enter the industry with limited time needed for training and courses, but in my opinion the changes to law about training has made it more difficult,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

Tuaese Taufa, 31, had just started work at an industrial complex in St Marys in Sydney's west when the forklift fell on top of him around 6.30am on Monday. He tragically died at the scene, despite desperate efforts from paramedics and colleagues to revive him. Mr Taufa worked for Custom Denning, a company that builds electrical buses. The workplace was shut down following the tragic accident. Distraught colleagues were seen at the site sitting in shock and being consoled before being sent home for the day. Mr Taufa's heartbroken family were also seen arriving at the site  where they were consoled by staff. Colleague Maea Folau regarded Mr Taufa as family. 'He's a good fella,' he told Seven News while fighting back to tears. 'He's like a son to me.'  Three ambulance crews were dispatched to the scene. 'It was a tragic incident. His colleagues were extremely brave to help him,' NSW Ambulance inspector Caitlyn Murphy said. 'Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, the man passed away.'  Shocked friends and family took to social media to express their shock and pay tribute in Tongan on Monday night.

  "97beb5f24c05ae386d190ff0981eefe2f475cce06bb105872fc965fb": "President Joe Biden said on Monday he's meeting with Debra and Marc Tice, the parents of journalist Austin Tice, who has been missing in Syria since 2012. Tice's mother was in the audience on Saturday night during the White House Correspondents' Association dinner, a gathering of elite media to celebrate the first amendment.  WHCA president Steve Portnoy of CBC News asked her to stand and paid tribute to Tice, a freelance reporter who worked for CBS, The Washington Post, and McClatchy. He was kidnapped in Syria on August 14, 2012.  'All over the world, journalists are subjected to jailing and intimidation for the use of pen pad camera and keyboard. They've been tortured, murdered, kidnapped, and we must never forget, Portnoy said. He then asked Debra Tice to stand and said of Austin Tice: 'He should be here with us tonight. But he's been held captive in Syria since 2012. As we take note of Trevor Reed's return our thoughts tonight are with Austin Tice.' Biden, who spoke at the event, said he would like to meet with her.  Halfway through his speech, Biden said to Debra: 'Mom, I'd like to meet you and Dad to talk about your son.'  Tice's parents have been pleading with the administration to help their son.  Tice's parents met with National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan in December as part of their plea.  'We have been very closely engaged with the family,' White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at her press briefing on Monday. She said she had no information on Austin Tice's whereabouts but said the administration would 'do everything we can' to bring him home. 'We are doing everything we can to engage with leaders with countries - even some we certainly do not have diplomatic relations with - to bring Americans home,' she said. Austin Tice's current whereabouts and health status remain unclear. It's been nearly nine years since he was last seen, which was on a video showing him bound and blindfolded.  The Biden administration has called on Syria to return Tice. 'We believe that it is within Bashar al-Assad's power to free Austin,' Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement in August marking Tice's 40th birthday. The call to free Tice gained steam after the Biden administration negotiated the successful release of former Marine Trevor Reed in a prisoner swap with Russia. Reed was detained in Russia in 2019. He was accused of assaulting a police officer while visiting his girlfriend in the country - something he has always denied. Trevor Reed's parents had been pleading with President Biden to bring their son home. In return for Reed's freedom, the U.S. agreed to return Konstantin Yaroshenko, a Russian pilot serving a 20-year federal prison sentence in Connecticut for smuggling drugs. Reed's parents said they are grateful to President Biden for saving their son's life.  President Donald Trump sent two administration officials to Syria in the summer of 2020 to try to negotiate Tice's release.  It did not happen.  At the time, Syrian officials told CBS News  that the Syrian government said no discussion could take place about U.S. hostages as long as U.S. military forces remained in Syria. Roughly 900 U.S. troops are in Syria.  Biden made his remarks on Tice after he presented the Presidential Rank Awards to 230 winners from 37 federal agencies in a virtual ceremony. The awards honor federal employees for their service.  Biden brought the awards back after Trump canceled them in 2020.  ",
  "264d807dbda7d16273f597cb237ffb284392b6962043122e6679f8f0": "The chief suspect in the Madeleine McCann case has been denied parole and branded a 'danger to society' - as he claimed he could not have abducted her because he was miles away at the time.  German national Christian Brueckner, 45, insists he was having sex with a woman in his camper van when three-year-old Madeleine disappeared while holidaying with her family in Praia da Luz, Portugal, on February 3, 2007. Bruckner further alleges that he drove the young woman to Faro Airport in Portugal on the morning after their encounter. He says the young woman was arrested at the airport for carrying pepper spray and later appeared in court, Sky News reports. Brueckner is understood have asked for Portugese Police to find a record of the incident, as he reportedly believes his relationship with the woman will prove his innocence.  Brueckner is currently serving seven years in jail for raping a pensioner in Praia da Luz and had become eligible for parole after serving half of his sentence, taking into account time spent on remand. But the Mirror reports that the panel are thought to have found a high risk of reoffending, concluding that his 'social prognosis' meant he had to stay locked up in Kiel, north Germany. Prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters, leading the investigation, said: 'I assume if he has anything that exonerates him that sooner or later he will share it with us and we would then check it out. What happens then, let's see. 'So far he has told us nothing, he's given us no alibi.' German police officers have reportedly told a possible witness to be ready to give evidence in court against Brueckner. The turn of events comes almost 15 years to the day that three-year-old Madeleine disappeared while holidaying with her family in Praia da Luz, Portugal. Madeleine vanished from the apartment she slept in with her two younger siblings while her parents visited a nearby tapas bar. Brueckner was first named as a suspect by German Police in 2020 and is known to be a convicted paedophile. German prosecutors insist they have evidence that Brueckner is responsible for Madeleine's disappearance. Portugese police listed him as an 'arguido' - an official suspect - in her disappearance last month. Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry McCann have never given up hope of finding their daughter alive but are said to have welcomed the news that Brueckner may be charged. The toddler vanished from the apartment she slept in with her two younger siblings on May 3, 2007, as her parents dined at a nearby tapas restaurant. Despite extensive police searches and worldwide media attention, no trace of Madeleine has ever been found. Prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters said that after gathering evidence, his team of investigators are '100% convinced' that Brueckner killed Madeleine. Friends who knew Brueckner during the time he stayed in Portugal in 2007 understand that charges will soon be made. One former friend said: 'I got a call from the Germans asking questions about a previous statement I made. 'They said I should be prepared to come to Germany, possibly at the end of the summer. They said they were hoping to charge Christian with something but didn't go into any more detail.' In addition to kidnapping Madeleine, Brueckner is also a suspect in the rape of an Irish tour rep in 2004 as well as exposing himself to children in a playground. It is not known if the new charges - said to be imminent - relate to Madeleine or the other crimes in which Brueckner is a suspect. Brueckner is serving a seven-year jail term for a brutal 2005 sex attack on a 72-year-old woman and his application for early release has been rejected by the German authorities. By Mark Williams-Thomas for the Daily Mail  The case against the man suspected of abducting and killing Madeleine McCann rests on three key pieces of evidence. Convicted paedophile Christian Brueckner was named last month by Portuguese police as the official chief suspect or arguido in her presumed murder. The question is: can we trust the evidence? Or is the entire indictment based on lies and wishful thinking? In a major private investigation, hunting down witnesses and conducting interviews across Europe for more than six months, I have uncovered significant fresh information that doesn't merely call the prosecution case into question. It blows their claims to smithereens. Not only are their facts inaccurate and misleading, but they are ignoring potentially the most important evidence of all - a strong alibi for Christian Brueckner, 44, supplied by a woman who has no reason to lie. Prosecutors in Germany, where Brueckner is in prison, assert he boasted of snatching, abusing and killing Madeleine in a bar-room confession to an associate. They point to the fact that Brueckner was living in Praia da Luz, close to the Algarve holiday complex in Portugal where Madeleine and her family were staying in May 2007. And, in the most sensational and damning claim of all, they say telecoms mast data shows Brueckner was outside the McCanns' apartment on his mobile phone for 30 minutes on the evening the little girl vanished. Though Madeleine's body has never been found and no forensic evidence exists to link Brueckner definitively to her abduction, those three strands when combined appear to show strong circumstantial evidence. There is no doubt he is a man with repellent sexual leanings. A self-confessed drug dealer and burglar, he is serving a seven-year sentence in a German prison for raping a 72-year-old woman in her home on the south coast of Portugal, not far from Praia da Luz in 2005. He denies having anything to do with Madeleine's disappearance. But to the general public, desperate for this notorious mystery to be solved and for an end to the ordeal of Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry, his guilt might now seem beyond question as a result of the German prosecutors' reports. I have been investigating the truth of what happened to Maddie, who was nine days away from her fourth birthday when she disappeared on May 3, 2007, since the beginning. Within 72 hours of the alarm being raised by Kate, when she checked on her three children during dinner at the Ocean Club in Praia da Luz and found that Madeleine was gone, I flew to the Algarve. I have followed every twist of the story with intense interest ever since. It is my fervent wish to see the perpetrator caught but that cannot be achieved by selecting a likely scapegoat and pinning the allegations on him. Worse, if the wrong man is convicted of Madeleine's murder, then the real killer remains free. In my determination to get to the truth, I have interviewed more people, tracked down more witnesses and broken down more obstacles than any other investigator. I have spoken in depth to the German prosecutors and Brueckner's solicitor as well as corresponding with the suspect himself. What I have uncovered is deeply troubling. The much-vaunted confession in a bar simply doesn't stand up. Not only is there no proof that it ever happened but the man accusing Brueckner lacks all credibility. It is concerning that the German police ever took his statements seriously. There is no doubt Brueckner was in the Algarve around the time of Madeleine's abduction. One woman's testimony proves that. But this woman, who was just 17 at the time of her brief relationship with the known drug pedlar and thief, can also place him miles away from Praia da Luz - and denies that his behaviour that week was in any way out of the ordinary. Just as damaging are my findings about the mobile supposedly used by Brueckner in Praia da Luz in the minutes before Maddie went missing. The idea that it pinpoints his whereabouts is just not accurate No one should imagine that I have anything but contempt and disgust for Brueckner. As I tracked his meanderings over the past 15 years, I found numerous sickening proofs of his sexual deviance. At one of his former lairs, a derelict shoe box factory in Braunschweig, Germany, police unearthed a massive stash of child abuse material. He bought the land in 2010 and sometimes stayed there in his camper van. A barmaid named Karola told me he took her there: 'It was unnerving even during daylight, and my colleague and I were joking, 'Nobody would notice if he made somebody disappear here'.' The site was discovered by police when a walker reported a foul stench. Officers found the body of one of Brueckner's dogs under a heap of child abuse material. At that time, Brueckner ran a tobacconist's kiosk. A former employee named Sabrina told me he beat his girlfriend, a young Russian woman, leaving her covered in bruises. 'He was a pig of a man,' she said. He was convicted in Germany in 2012 of dealing in indecent images, 19 years after he was charged with two counts of sexually assaulting children when he was just 17. And in 2017 he was arrested for exposing himself to children in a playground. With such vile behaviour, it's easy to assume he must capable of abducting and killing a three-year-old. And, knowing that he was in the Algarve in May 2007, that appears to be exactly what German police have done. But being a child abuser does not make you a child killer. Through meticulous inquiries, I have been digging into those assumptions. And their foundations are weak or non-existent. For many, the phone mast evidence is the most damning. Prosecutors say confidently that Brueckner was using a Portuguese mobile with a number ending in '680' in early 2007. Despite poisonous rumours and speculation by people who lack real insight into the crime, there is no evidence at all against Madeleine's parents Gerry and Kate. They were clearly not involved in any way with her disappearance. But Portuguese police made a grave error by failing to treat them as suspects immediately. That is simply good practice: they should have systematically eliminated those closest to the child from their inquiries to clear the ground from under their feet. Instead police started with the assumption that a stranger had abducted her. When that theory faltered, they aggressively turned their focus on the McCanns. Gerry and Kate were in an impossible situation, at the centre of a worldwide media storm and out of their minds with worry for their daughter. When they were declared formal suspects, or arguidos, whatever they did was bound to be criticised. So what is the truth of Madeleine's disappearance? The mistake most investigators have made was to assume she was taken from her bed in the apartment. In fact, it is far more likely that Maddie left on her own. That morning, she had said that her brother and sister, twins Sean and Amelie, two, had woken up during the previous evening while the adults were out at dinner, and that their crying disturbed her. What would be more natural than for Madeleine, woken again by her brother or sister, to go looking for her parents? Perhaps she turned the wrong way as she left the flat and wandered into the car park. Wherever she was, a predatory stranger saw her and acted on impulse. One of the McCanns' friends, Jane Tanner, thought she saw a man carrying a small child in pyjamas when she went at 9.15pm to check the children were sleeping. Perhaps that was the abductor - or perhaps no one saw him at all. This kind of opportunistic crime is very rare but not unknown. My hunch is that more than one person knows what happened to Madeleine. I live in hope that the silence could break, as allegiances shift or attitudes change. Phone records show categorically that, between 7.32pm and 8.02pm, this number was in use to another Portuguese phone, ending in '683'. It has been widely reported that analysis of the signal places the '680' number very close to the Ocean Club, perhaps even outside the McCanns' window. To add to the circumstantial evidence, the '683' number I have linked to a sex offender whose activity on the internet's 'dark web' sites is also heavily linked to child abusers. But there's a major problem. I cannot find any evidence '680' was ever Brueckner's regular number, in fact I have found contra evidence. The German police have just one witness, a woman who says she called '680' and spoke to Brueckner. With so much publicity around the case, I would expect to see many people coming forward to confirm that the suspect was using this number. In fact, there is irrefutable evidence from multiple witnesses that '680' was regularly used by a different man, a close friend of Brueckner's who was also based in south Portugal. Paperwork and an official document that I have seen show this was his phone - not Brueckner's. So it can't be established the suspect was even using '680' on the evening Madeleine was taken. My investigation has demolished this evidence in a second way. We know the phone call at 7.32pm 'pinged' off a mast 200 yards from the Ocean Club. But that doesn't mean the user was nearby as the mast has a range of up to 21 miles. When mobiles 'talk' to two or three masts, it is often possible to locate them by triangulation. That is not what happened here. The bare fact is that someone, almost certainly not Brueckner, received a 30-minute call on '680' somewhere in south Portugal that evening. This is not compelling evidence and actually makes the phone number ending '680' irrelevant. My findings have been presented to the German authorities who say they are not bothered by the phone mast evidence. Nor do they seem concerned at the unreliability of the convicted drug dealer and people trafficker who claims Brueckner confessed in a bar in 2008 to killing Madeleine. His name is Helge Busching and he is, quite simply, a fantasist. One informant showed me a video of Busching in paramilitary kit, spouting nonsense about the case. Busching and an associate, Manfred Seyferth, told police they saw videos filmed by Brueckner as he beat and raped a 72-year-old woman. Those tapes have never been produced. Busching lacks real credibility and should be treated very cautiously as a witness. Even his initial statement to police is a major concern because he was given payment for information. It could be argued Busching and Seyferth would say almost anything for money. Busching has said he will give an interview for 50,000 euros to be paid into the McCanns' fighting fund - a bizarre stipulation. So far, he has had no takers. Brueckner has repeatedly offered to be interviewed and then withdrawn. I wrote to him in prison, and eventually he agreed to see me. That was vetoed by the German authorities but Brueckner did write a four-page letter in which he admitted living in Praia da Luz in the early 2000s before being jailed for sex offences. He insisted that, after his release in 2006, he did not return to the resort. Instead, he started importing and dealing drugs from his camper van along the coast. One of his prime sites, he said, was Barranco Beach, 20km (12 miles) from Praia da Luz. That is corroborated by a photo of his van by the cliffs there. 'I was selling drugs on a large scale,' he wrote. 'I'd make trips back and forth to Spain, bringing drugs back, marijuana, making a good living.' That tallies with his criminal record: his first arrest for drug dealing came after 2007. The letter contained another assertion that could exonerate him completely. Brueckner claims he has an alibi. During the week when Madeleine went missing, he was in a brief relationship with a 17-year-old German on holiday with her parents. Each night, she would leave their lodgings and spend several hours with Brueckner in his van. Her family was staying in Carvoeiro, about 44km (27 miles) from Praia da Luz - about 40 minutes by road. Each evening he would leave the beach, drive into the town, park and leave at 10am. Flight records show this family was in the Algarve that week. And that on May 10 the girl came to the notice of police as she was illegally carrying a pepper spray. I have tracked down this woman, now 32, to a small town in Germany. She is very reluctant to take part in the inquiry, though if she is formally called by the police she will have to give evidence at trial. That evidence surely rules out Brueckner. I confirm that, although she cannot say exactly what they were doing on May 3, she is sure his behaviour showed no changes or signs of stress that week. And even more significant is that in the days after Madeleine disappeared, Brueckner was driving around in the van in which she was apparently abducted Is it conceivable that this man drove to Praia da Luz, kidnapped a three-year-old some time after 9pm, abused and probably killed her, disposed of her body and then drove for more than half-an-hour, to meet his girlfriend? Could he have acted as though nothing had occurred? I must reiterate that Brueckner groomed and abused children. But there is a massive difference between committing these offences and the abduction and murder of a child. Nothing I have seen suggests he has a predilection to kill, let alone that he could carry out so hideous an act and then behave, an hour later, as if nothing had happened. None of the supposed evidence against him stands up. No wonder over two years on, the German prosecutors have not charged him. I have no evidence Brueckner is responsible for the abduction and murder of Madeleine McCann.",
  "09313f457e614a62062f7568c8b0f1cd561fbb4564e452dac98f6670": "A Chinese food delivery driver working three jobs was shot dead mid-shift late on Saturday - as cops probe whether a furious customer pulled the trigger. Zhiwen Yan, 45, was doing the rounds on his scooter in Forest Hills, Queens, at 9:30 pm, cops say, when he was blasted in the chest by an unidentified suspect. The shooting saw Yan and the suspect briefly exchange words before he was hit near 108th Street and 67th Drive, in what is usually a quiet, close-knit community. Police say the incident came immediately after Yan - a father-of-three who moved to New York from China more than two decades ago - had dropped off a delivery. Shocking video obtained by police shows Yan pulling onto 108th Street when the suspect approaches on foot with a gun drawn, cops say. In the clip, which has not been released, Yan tries to roll backward on the bike to get away when the suspect suddenly shoots, sending the scooter falling to the ground. According to his family, the Chinese-born New Yorker had been working seven days a week when he was killed, trying to support his wife and school-aged kids. Cops have yet to make an arrest in the case - and so far, a suspect has not been named. But they are investigating claims from Yan's fellow staffer Soi Chung, 70, a 50-year-old 'disgruntled' customer was the one who took his friend's life. According to Chung, the supposed suspect had 'multiple' disputes with the Forest Hills eatery, Chinese restaurant Great Wall, and pulled a gun on staffers during one incident in January. Another incident last year saw the angry patron became peeved over the amount of duck sauce given to him in one of his orders, Chung told The New York Post, spurring a campaign of harassment, vandalism, and threats from the customer. The customer - the only person of interest in the case thus far - is currently wanted for questioning by the New York Police Department, law enforcement sources told the outlet. The beef with the rowdy regular, Chung said, began one night last year. 'The customer came in and ordered some food,' Chung, who has worked at the Queens establishment for 20 years, recalled to the paper Monday.   The encounter was friendly first, according to Chung - but things quickly turned when the customer deemed the amount of duck sauce he had received with his order to be unsatisfactory.  'He left with the food but then came back and said 'It's not enough,'' Chung said. 'He came to the counter and wanted more food, more duck sauce.' An argument then ensued, Chung told the outlet, spurring Yan's and Chung's employer to get involved. 'They had an argument,' Chung told the Post, 'and the boss said, 'It's enough already.' The veteran restaurant worker said that the jilted customer then walked out of the restaurant in a huff, before returning to vandalize the establishment with - what else? - the duck sauce. 'The guy left the restaurant, and later came back and threw the duck sauce, everything, all over the place,' Chung recalled. 'The police came and took a report, but the guy was gone.' However, according to Chung, the strange saga was far from over - with the guest's harassment campaign only growing more brazen and threatening. 'After that, sometimes, he'd be waiting around outside,' Chung told the outlet Tuesday, as cops continued to comb the city in hopes of tracking down Yan's killer.  'He'd say to the boss and to the delivery guy and to one of the chefs, 'I remember you. I remember you,' the restaurant staffer said, adding that the customer twice vandalized Great Wall staffers' cars, and once slashed the tires on the manager of the establishment's vehicle. The most brazen threat from the customer, Chung said, came earlier this year, when the customer - who reportedly drives an older model Lexus RX3 SUV, a witness told The Post - menacingly waved a gun at the restaurant workers, spurring them to call the cops. Chung said the customer's crusade against Great Wall has since ceased, but is adamant that he is the one responsible for Yan's death, which has rocked the residential neighborhood where the deceased delivery man had resided for more than a decade. Chung's theory does hold some weight - police insiders told the Post Monday that cops are currently searching for the 50-year-old suspect so that they can detain him for questioning. What's more, one Forest Hills resident who witnessed some of the patron's reported intimidation tactics against workers at Great Wall reportedly told police the customer drove off on one occasion in his Lexus RX3 SUV - the same type of vehicle cops say was spotted fleeing the scene of the shooting.  The Post noted that it would be withholding the customer's name until he was officially named a suspect or person of interest in the case.   No arrests have been made as of Monday evening, nearly 48 hours after the fatal shooting. Yan leaves behind a wife and three children, aged two, 12, and 14. 'This was a father of three children working three jobs - all food delivery,' Yan's nephew, who identified himself as Michael, said during a presser held outside the family's home in neighboring Middle Village Sunday. 'He came here in 2001,' the relative went on. 'He has been in this country over 20 years. I would like to know why this murder took place. I would like to find out the truth and get justice. This was a brutal murder.' He added: 'It's unacceptable that this happened. This is a very peaceful community. This never happened, this kind of issue.' The presser also saw Yan's wife, Kunying Zhao, repeatedly burst into tears after emerging from the family home while being questioned by reporters, while her youngest daughter looked on from the doorway behind her. 'Somebody, somebody killed my husband,' Zhao said through tears. 'Catch him, catch him,' she pleaded to cops attending the conference. Despite Yan's colleagues claims concerning the threatening customer, it is currently unclear if the delivery man was being targeted.  Cops said the shooter fired several times before fleeing, and drove eastbound on 67th Drive. Cops are currently scouring the neighborhood for surveillance footage of the shooting.  A GoFundMe page posted Sunday to benefit Yan's three children described the shooting as 'a random act of road rage.' 'He immigrated from China and worked in food delivery for more than 20 years,' the fundraiser notes. '[He] leaves behind his wife and three children, ages 2, 12, and 14.' The page surpassed its initial goal of $100,000 Monday, raising $122,000 as of Monday evening. The crime came less than 24 hours after Mayor Eric Adams met with police officials in Manhattan to discuss a plan to combat the city's recent violent crime wave. An investigation is currently underway. ",

The online EONK store, headquartered in Moscow, is selling a range of the small plastic toys which includes military trucks, multiple rocket launcher systems, fuel tankers, missile launchers and personnel carriers. Prices range from 602 - 817 roubles, equivalent to roughly PS6.12 - PS9.25. Their sale comes as part of a nationwide campaign to drum up support for Russia's war effort among young people, which has seen ailing children dragged out of hospital to stand in the shape of a Z and young gymnasts sporting the symbol on their singlets. First seen on tanks and armoured vehicles on the battlefield, the letter Z has since been adopted for propaganda purposes by Putin's regime and is now seemingly ubiquitous in Russian media as well as on the front lines. Pro-Putin celebrities have taken to wearing Z badges, and youth activists have released videos of themselves in Z-branded T-shirts, screaming: 'For Russia! For Putin!' The Kremlin has claimed the letter Z stands for the phrase 'za pobedu' (for victory), while the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine says it denotes units from Russia's Eastern Military District, and -- if encased in a square -- forces from Crimea. But Russia's use of the Z symbol is confusing, given the character itself does not exist in the Russian language's Cyrillic alphabet.  The sound of the letter Z is denoted with the Cyrillic character 'z', leading commentators to question why the latin Z was adopted by Russia's armed forces and Putin's propaganda campaign in the first place. Some pro-Ukrainian commentators have compared Russia's use of the Z sign to the Nazis use of the swastika during World War II. Meanwhile, Israel today denounced comments by Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and demanded an apology after he suggested that Adolf Hitler had Jewish roots.  Lavrov made the remark when challenged by an Italian TV station over his claim that Russia is 'de-Nazifying' Ukraine, pointing out that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is Jewish.  'I think that Hitler also had Jewish origins, so it means nothing,' Lavrov said. 'For a long time now we've been hearing the wise Jewish people say that the biggest anti-Semites are the Jews themselves.' Yair Lapid, Israel's foreign minister, today branded the remark 'scandalous' and said the Russian ambassador would be summoned for a 'tough talk'.  Zelensky himself said: 'I have no words... No one has heard any denial or any justification from Moscow. All we have from there is silence... This means that the Russian leadership has forgotten all the lessons of World War Two. 'Or perhaps they have never learned those lessons.' Dani Dayan, chairman of Yad Vashem, Israel's memorial to the six million Jews killed in the Holocaust, said the Russian minister's remarks were 'an insult and a severe blow to the victims of the real Nazism'. Speaking on Kan radio, Dayan said Lavrov was spreading 'an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory with no basis in fact'. In 2018, a study conducted by Belgian journalist Jean-Paul Mulders and Hitler expert historian Marc Vermeeren collected saliva samples from more than three dozen of the Nazi dictator's living relatives. The relatives' DNA was subjected to tests to determine their main haplogroups - parts of chromosomes which geneticists can use to distinguish between different ancestries.  The study, which was reported by History.com, found that Hitler's relatives appeared to share a dominant haplogroup which is common among North Africans and two different groups of Jews.  ",

The bloc could also be forced to soften any announcement after Hungary threatened to veto an outright ban. The EU's sixth package of sanctions could be unveiled as soon as today but would require unanimous agreement of all 27 member countries. Robert Habeck, Germany's economy minister and deputy chancellor, said Berlin backed the ban but warned of the knock-on effect for consumers. EU sources conceded yesterday that Slovakia and Hungary could be offered 'an exemption or a long transition period' to keep the bloc united. Poland said yesterday it is ready to be independent from Russian oil and is willing to support other countries to cut their supplies. Austria and Italy have also expressed reservations about a total ban by the end of 2022. Around half of Russia's 4.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude exports go to the EU, which has paid around PS17bn for Russian energy since the invasion on February 24. EU ministers met in Brussels yesterday to discuss their response to Russia's decision last week to cut gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland, which was branded 'blackmail'. Energy giant Gazprom says the two countries failed to pay their bills in April. The two countries had refused to accept Russian President Vladimir Putin's demand that 'unfriendly' countries must start paying for gas in Russian rubles. More Gazprom bills are due on May 20, and the bloc is wary that Russia might turn off more taps then. Britain has already pledged to phase out imports of Russian oil by the end of the year. Russian imports recently accounted for 8pc of total UK oil demand.",
  "aefad0e4d15a124fefcb3282be7d8d60da4009ba2a0cb463f54d2cfb": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said on Monday he 'rejected' an invite to the White House Correspondents' Association dinner and slammed comedian Trevor Noah for 'lying' that he was there. 'I was what I would never attend that I have no interest in that. I did not watch it,' the Republican governor of Florida told reporters at a press conference.  'I don't care what they do, but for them to advertise me when that invitation was rejected by my office, that is a lie,' he said.  'They are lying about something that is readily verifiable.'  He said he had no interested in joining a 'cabal' of elites from Washington D.C. and New York at the black tie gathering of journalists, celebrities, business leaders and President Joe Biden. 'The idea that I would have ever gone is false and why they would want to try to perpetuate a lie about that I don't know. But I think it just shows you why that cabal of people in DC, New York, are so reviled by so many Americans. I think it's a reputation that's been well deserved,' he noted. Daily Show host Trevor Noah, in his remarks at Saturday's dinner, said DeSantis was in the audience. He mocked the governor a few times during his speech, poking fun at DeSantis' reported rivalry with Donald Trump ahead of the 2024 presidential campaign. 'One of my favorites, Ron DeSantis is here,' Noah said. 'Oh man, I'm actually surprised that he found the time. You know he has been so busy trying to outmaneuver [former President Donald] Trump for 2024. I see you, Ron. I see you, player.'  DeSantis' name was included in the event's program.  His team has downplayed any presidential ambitions as he seeks re-election to a second term for governor this year. DeSantis has led in some straw polls on the race for the 2024 Republican nomination. Republicans around the country have praised him for keeping Florida open during the covid pandemic and defying recommendations on mask wearing.  Noah joked that DeSantis could pull a Trump in 2024 and claim victory no matter the actual result. Trump still falsely claims he won the 2020 election. '[If] Trump was the original Terminator, DeSantis is like the T-1000. You're smarter than him, you're slicker than him, you can walk down ramps,' Noah said.  'Because you see, no, Trump said he won the election, but everyone was just able to look at the numbers and see he was wrong. That's why Ron DeSantis is one step ahead, first you ban the math textbooks, then nobody knows how to count the votes. Boom, my man!'  Florida's Department of Education has banned dozens of math textbooks, saying they have 'problematic' material. The state tossed out 41 percent of the 132 math textbooks submitted for the next school year, more than half of which the state said referenced Critical Race Theory (CRT), with the rest containing Common Core and Social Emotional Learning (SEL). During Saturday night's event, where almost 3,000 people crowded into a ballroom at the Washington Hilton, President Joe Biden mocked his own low approval rating and called the Trump administration a 'horrible plague.' 'Tonight, we come here to answer a very important question in everybody's mind. Why in hell are we still doing this?' Biden quipped as he took the stage in the room full of journalists and D.C. insiders.  'I know there are questions about whether we should gather here tonight because of COVID. Well, we're here to show the country that we're getting through this pandemic. Plus, everyone had to prove they're fully vaccinated and boosted,' he said. 'Just contact your favorite Fox News reporter they're all here vaccinated and boosted.' He then addressed his historically low poll numbers for the first time, claiming that journalists were the only people who were less well-liked. 'I'm really excited to be here tonight with the only group of Americans have a lower approval rating than I have,' Biden said.  However, Biden wasn't the only one to embrace comedy at Saturday's affair. The Late Late Show James Corden opened the dinner with a sketch of him taking over the duties of Press Secretary Jen Psaki, which included a cameo from a reporter she regularly clashes with, Fox News' Peter Doocy.  Corden eagerly took to the podium to take questions from reporters following a briefing with Psaki and Biden, but the ill-prepared Corden was immediately flanked with complicated questions from reporters.  Among them was Doocy, who Biden was recorded calling a 'stupid son of a b****' in January, with Psaki echoing similar remarks earlier this month. Biden reportedly called Doocy afterwards to apologize. Despite the critical comments from them, Doocy played his part in Corden's sketch on Saturday, appearing straight-forward and no-nonsense as he took on the fumbling comedian.  Doocy asks the 'interim-press secretary', 'When the president says one thing, and White House staff say something else, who are we supposed to listen to? The president, or White House staff?' 'Well you know what, David,' the comedian, appearing fed up by the questions from all the reporters.  'That's not my name,' Doocy quickly replies. 'You say your name is not David. I say your name is David,' Corden snaps back.  'And I'm stood up here and you're sat down there - unless you wanna be sat at the back with whoever they are' Corden added as he threatened to move Doocy to the far-end of the press room.  Corden's sketch also involved digs at the Biden administration as Psaki told him that the CDC is 'good,' to which he replies, 'Really? 'They've been pissing me off.' Psaki also tells him that the economy is strong, with Corden again questioning the validity of the statement.  'Is it,' he asks doubtfully as Psaki moves on to the rest of the briefing.  Also at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, Trevor Noah slammed the administration for rising consumer costs, taking aim at what analysts predict is a looming recession. The Daily Show Host touted Biden for coming out to the event on Saturday, saying he doesn't know why the president would miss a chance to hear all about his supposed accomplishments. 'You know, I think ever since you've come into office, things are really looking up. Gas is up. Rent is up. Food is up. Everything,' Noah joked about inflation, which is at the highest it's been in 40 years. President Joe Biden kicked off the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner on Saturday with his own quips about his administration and his political rivals.   'I'm really excited to be here tonight with the only group of Americans have a lower approval rating than I have,' Biden, who FiveThiryEight's latest poll has him at a 41.7 approval rating, told the journalists, celebrities and politicians attending the event. 'Well, that's hard to say after what we just saw this the first time President attended this dinner in six years.' 'Well that's understandable - we had a horrible plague, followed by two years of COVID,' the president added.  'Imagine if my predecessor came to this dinner this year. Now that would really have been a real coup that occurred,' Biden said, taking jabs at the January 6 Capitol riot. 'Folks, I'm not really here to roast the GOP. That's not my style. Besides, there's nothing I can say about the GOP that Kevin McCarthy hasn't already put on tape,' Biden quipped, referencing the leaked tapes of the House Minority leader saying he would ask former President Donald Trump to resign after January 6. 'At the same time, a lot of people say the Republican Party's too extreme too divisive to control by one person. They say that's not your father's Republican Party. Ronald Reagan said Mr. Gorbachev, tear this wall down. Today's Republicans say 'Tear down Mickey Mouse's house.'  And pretty soon they'll be storming Cinderella's castle. You can be sure that Republicans seem to support one fella. Some guy named Brandon. He's having a really good year. I'm kind of happy for him,' Biden said, referring to conservative rallying cry 'Let's Go Brandon.'  Saturday night's event - attended by reality TV star Kim Kardashian and her boyfriend, Pete Davidson, and other big stars including Drew Barrymore, Martha Stewart, Chris Tucker and Academy Award-winning actor Michael Keaton - saw Biden mock himself by addressing his low approval rating of 41.7 and his predecessor, Donald Trump.  'Well, that's hard to say after what we just saw this the first time President attended this dinner in six years.' 'Well that's understandable - we had a horrible plague, followed by two years of COVID,' the president added.  'Imagine if my predecessor came to this dinner this year. Now that would really have been a real coup that occurred!' Biden then turned his attention to Republicans, and the leaked tapes of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy claiming he would ask President Trump to resign after January 6. 'Folks, I'm not really here to roast the GOP. That's not my style. Besides, there's nothing I can say about the GOP that Kevin McCarthy hasn't already put on tape,' Biden said to a room full of chuckles.  'At the same time, a lot of people say the Republican Party's too extreme too divisive to control by one person. They say that's not your father's Republican Party. Ronald Reagan said Mr. Gorbachev, tear this wall down. Today's Republicans say 'Tear down Mickey Mouse's house.'  'And pretty soon they'll be storming Cinderella's castle. You can be sure that Republicans seem to support one fella. Some guy named Brandon. He's having a really good year. I'm kind of happy for him,' Biden said, referring to conservative rallying cry 'Let's Go Brandon.'  Biden then introduced comedian Trevor Noah, who is headlining the event, who mocked the large maskless gathering.   'It is my great honor to be speaking tonight at the nation's most distinguished super spreader events,' Noah said. 'No for real people. What are we doing here? Let's be honest. What are we doing? Like did none of you learn anything from the Grid Iron Dinner?'  Dozens of high-profile attendees tested positive for COVID-19 after attending the exclusive media event weeks earlier.   'Do you read any of your own newspapers? I mean, I expect this from Sean Hannity, but the rest of you What are you doing?,' he added.  'I spent the last two years telling everyone the importance of wearing masks and avoiding large indoor gatherings. Then the second someone offers you a free dinner you'll turn into Joe Rogan. I mean, Dr. Fauci dropped out,' Noah said. 'That should have been a pretty big sign. Fauci thought it was too dangerous to come tonight. Pete Davidson thinks it's okay,' Noah said, pointing to Kim Kardashian's date.  Noah then turned his focus to the president.   'As you all know, President Biden's lack of a filter does get him into hot water sometimes, you know, last month he caused a huge international incidents saying that Vladimir Putin should be removed from power was very, very upsetting to Russia,' Noah said. 'So someone explained to them that none of the stuff Biden wants actually gets done.' In late March Biden made waves by proclaiming Russian Leader Vladimir Putin 'cannot remain in power,' remarks that the Kremlin replayed on state TV airwaves as a personal attack on Russia.  Noah then turned his attention to Psaki, who is reportedly in negotiations with MSNBC for a contract after she soon leaves the White House.  'The word on the streets is actually that Jen Psaki is going to MSNBC next month. Yeah. Yeah, apparently just being on C-SPAN the ratings are too high. And she wanted more of a challenge, you know, want to switch things up? She can't laugh at that. Don't put the camera on her.'  'You know, moving to MSNBC is going to be a big switch for you because right now your current job is to make the Biden administration looks as good as possible, you know, at all costs. Now you're going to be at MSNBC and you're going to have to .... you'll be fine actually,' he quipped.  'By the way MSNBC, can I just say you guys are doing great work. I love watching your shows you know when Trump was in office, your shows were all about how bad he was. And now that Biden's in office, your shows are all about how bad Trump was. Consistency is important.' Noah then poked fun at CNN's Jeffrey Toobin, who was caught masturbating on a work call.  'We're celebrating without you don't get comfortable. Not too comfortable, Jeffrey Toobin, not too comfortable,' Noah said. 'No, you know what? No, don't don't do him a bunch of haters. You know what? So what Jeffrey, you made a mistake. You whipped it out in front of your coworkers.' 'Where is Jeffrey Zucker?' Noah asked, referring to CNN's former head, who left after it was revealed he was having a relationship with a colleague.  'Jeff got fired off because he tried to keep his workplace relationship secret, which is weird, because if he really didn't want anyone to know about him, he could have just made a show about it on CNN Plus!'  'I know I know. It's so sad. CNN Plus gone, but forgotten,' Noah added, referring to CNN's now-failed streaming venture.  'I blame John King. That's true. Yeah, John, your magic wall can predict how every person in the country is going to vote in every county, but it couldn't give you a heads up that nobody wanted more CNN,' Noah added.  He then turned his attention to CNN's gratuitous use of the 'Breaking News' banner.  'My man over there, Chris, as the new head of news. His first order of business hire guy who knows how to turn off the breaking news banner. What happened with that they just put it on during the OJ chase and then never figured out how to get rid of it? The news is not always breaking!' Noah also directed his wise cracks at Fox News, as he turned to the White House press corps: 'Everyday you demand answers on the pressing issues of the day. And then Fox News asked about Hunter Biden. And I'll be honest, though, I actually think that's a good thing. I really do. I think people need to be held accountable if they're using their dad's name to get ahead in life. I can't think of anyone better to ask about that than Peter Doocy.' Doocy's prominent role with the channel came after his father Steve Doocy joined the channel.  He then turned his attention to primetime host Sean Hannity, who is dating Fox host Ainsley Earhardt. 'Sean Hannity and Ainsley Earhart's actually dating now. Yes. And I actually think it's beautiful to see an office romance of folks that won't enter the $20 million settlement. Yeah. I'm sure whoever Roger Ailes is right now. He's looking up and smiling.'  'Laura Ingram - wow. What can you say about her that hasn't already been said by the anti-Defamation League?' Noah added. Then came Tucker Carlson.  'Tucker Carlson Are you kidding me? I mean, he's a beast who else could fill an entire show each night asking questions that Google could easily answer. 'Do vaccines work? Who really won the election? Who is the president right now? Is this America?' Noah said.  The comedian also took a minute to thank the reporters in the room for their duty as the fourth estate to make sure those in power are held accountable by the people, and noted that being able to roast a sitting president was a luxury afforded to him by America's freedoms.  'I stood here tonight and I made fun of the President of the United States, and I'm going to be fine,' Noah said.  But, he made one last dig at Biden as he concluded the evening, referencing the U.S.'s frenzied withdrawal from Afghanistan.  'Please be careful leaving tonight. This administration doesn't handle evacuations. Well. Good night, everybody.' ",
  "32efc2e4e1f3d90ed9d11061757a986bc02fc22fb9b685ddd1212e0b": "A six-year-old Connecticut boy who suffered serious burns when a lit tennis ball doused in gasoline was thrown at his face has been 'terrorized' for more than a year by a bully who once chased him with an ax and caused him to suffer a concussion when he knocked him over with a pillow, according to the victim's mother.  Dominick Justino Krankall, suffered second and third-degree burns in the April 24 attack when his eight-year-old neighbor threw the ball doused in gasoline at him while they were playing in the backyard. Rua told the DailyMail.com that when her son ran into their home screaming, 'Mommy, they lit me on fire', his legs were still smoking and his face was bright red.  'It was horrifying,' she said. 'If he didn't stop, drop and roll which he did after the fire started he may have died.' His mother, Maria Rua, told DailyMail.com that her son is emotionally scarred by the year-long bullying which started when the family moved to Bridgeport.  Rua said that Dominick might need surgery on his forehead after this latest incident.  'He had lost his eyebrows and some of his hair. He may suffer from permanent discoloration on his face and the doctors said that he cannot be in the sun because  his skin cannot be exposed for fear it may blister back up,' she said. She added: 'Dominick loves to be outdoors but he will now have restrictions and it going to be a different type of summer for him.'  Despite all that he has endured, Rua has called him a 'trooper.' She said that he has been helping the doctors change his bandages and has been giving himself his own medicine.  She said since the bandages were removed from his chin and he was able to eat a cheeseburger. 'I got him a McDonald's Happy Meal. He was so happy that he could swallow,' his mother said. Rua said that her son had been terrorized by their eight-year-old neighbor, and his brother 11, but she is unable to move because she can't afford to.  In the past year, Rua claims that her son's bully once hit him so hard with a pillow that he fell backward, and suffered a concussion and was admitted to hospital overnight to be monitored.  In another incident, she said she saw her son being chased by the bully with an ax. And she claims that the boy and his brother also lit Dominick's bicycle on fire.   She told DailyMail.com that she has spoken to the mother of her son's bully on several occasions, but pleas to stop the behavior have gone ignored.  'The mother hasn't taken responsibility at all. She hasn't shown an ounce of pity or compassion. My son almost burned to death and the mother still claims that my son did this to himself. That is impossible,' Rua told Dailymail.com.  'She is in denial and will never admit that her son did anything wrong.'  Rua said after the incident, the bully's mother gave him an ice-cream cone while she prayed at her own son's bedside.  She added that the bully, who attends Read Elementary School with her son, was recently removed from school after he threatened to shoot it up. And she claimed that they moved him to a different school for children with behavioral issues.  'These kids are bullies and physically abusive. They even threatened that they would light me on fire. They are angry kids and they are going to hurt someone,' she said. When the ambulance arrived her fiance, Aaron Krankell went to the hospital with their son but she was handcuffed and detained by Bridgeport Police who questioned her about the incident.  'They police claimed that I neglected to take care of the neighbor's kids and they put me in the back of the police car interrogating me for at least 20 minutes and keeping me from getting to the hospital to be with my son,' Rua said.  She also said that a day after the incident the bully's mother contacted Department of Family and Children Services to report her. 'She said my kids had no clothes or food which when they came they quickly realized that wasn't the case at all,' Rua said.   'This child needs help. He is only eight,' Rua said. 'He is crying out for help and no one is paying attention to him.'",
  "8d32f6c317d7605efe2c9b2c8bb170c72611559b04153fbf115df991": "The case against the man suspected of abducting and killing Madeleine McCann rests on three key pieces of evidence. Convicted paedophile Christian Brueckner was named last month by Portuguese police as the official chief suspect or arguido in her presumed murder. The question is: can we trust the evidence? Or is the entire indictment based on lies and wishful thinking? In a major private investigation, hunting down witnesses and conducting interviews across Europe for more than six months, I have uncovered significant fresh information that doesn't merely call the prosecution case into question. It blows their claims to smithereens. Not only are their facts inaccurate and misleading, but they are ignoring potentially the most important evidence of all - a strong alibi for Christian Brueckner, 44, supplied by a woman who has no reason to lie. Prosecutors in Germany, where Brueckner is in prison, assert he boasted of snatching, abusing and killing Madeleine in a bar-room confession to an associate. They point to the fact that Brueckner was living in Praia da Luz, close to the Algarve holiday complex in Portugal where Madeleine and her family were staying in May 2007. And, in the most sensational and damning claim of all, they say telecoms mast data shows Brueckner was outside the McCanns' apartment on his mobile phone for 30 minutes on the evening the little girl vanished. Though Madeleine's body has never been found and no forensic evidence exists to link Brueckner definitively to her abduction, those three strands when combined appear to show strong circumstantial evidence. There is no doubt he is a man with repellent sexual leanings. A self-confessed drug dealer and burglar, he is serving a seven-year sentence in a German prison for raping a 72-year-old woman in her home on the south coast of Portugal, not far from Praia da Luz in 2005. He denies having anything to do with Madeleine's disappearance. But to the general public, desperate for this notorious mystery to be solved and for an end to the ordeal of Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry, his guilt might now seem beyond question as a result of the German prosecutors' reports. I have been investigating the truth of what happened to Maddie, who was nine days away from her fourth birthday when she disappeared on May 3, 2007, since the beginning. Within 72 hours of the alarm being raised by Kate, when she checked on her three children during dinner at the Ocean Club in Praia da Luz and found that Madeleine was gone, I flew to the Algarve. I have followed every twist of the story with intense interest ever since. It is my fervent wish to see the perpetrator caught but that cannot be achieved by selecting a likely scapegoat and pinning the allegations on him. Worse, if the wrong man is convicted of Madeleine's murder, then the real killer remains free. In my determination to get to the truth, I have interviewed more people, tracked down more witnesses and broken down more obstacles than any other investigator. I have spoken in depth to the German prosecutors and Brueckner's solicitor as well as corresponding with the suspect himself. What I have uncovered is deeply troubling. The much-vaunted confession in a bar simply doesn't stand up. Not only is there no proof that it ever happened but the man accusing Brueckner lacks all credibility. It is concerning that the German police ever took his statements seriously. There is no doubt Brueckner was in the Algarve around the time of Madeleine's abduction. One woman's testimony proves that. But this woman, who was just 17 at the time of her brief relationship with the known drug pedlar and thief, can also place him miles away from Praia da Luz - and denies that his behaviour that week was in any way out of the ordinary. Just as damaging are my findings about the mobile supposedly used by Brueckner in Praia da Luz in the minutes before Maddie went missing. The idea that it pinpoints his whereabouts is just not accurate No one should imagine that I have anything but contempt and disgust for Brueckner. As I tracked his meanderings over the past 15 years, I found numerous sickening proofs of his sexual deviance. At one of his former lairs, a derelict shoe box factory in Braunschweig, Germany, police unearthed a massive stash of child abuse material. He bought the land in 2010 and sometimes stayed there in his camper van. A barmaid named Karola told me he took her there: 'It was unnerving even during daylight, and my colleague and I were joking, 'Nobody would notice if he made somebody disappear here'.' The site was discovered by police when a walker reported a foul stench. Officers found the body of one of Brueckner's dogs under a heap of child abuse material. At that time, Brueckner ran a tobacconist's kiosk. A former employee named Sabrina told me he beat his girlfriend, a young Russian woman, leaving her covered in bruises. 'He was a pig of a man,' she said. He was convicted in Germany in 2012 of dealing in indecent images, 19 years after he was charged with two counts of sexually assaulting children when he was just 17. And in 2017 he was arrested for exposing himself to children in a playground. With such vile behaviour, it's easy to assume he must capable of abducting and killing a three-year-old. And, knowing that he was in the Algarve in May 2007, that appears to be exactly what German police have done. But being a child abuser does not make you a child killer. Through meticulous inquiries, I have been digging into those assumptions. And their foundations are weak or non-existent. For many, the phone mast evidence is the most damning. Prosecutors say confidently that Brueckner was using a Portuguese mobile with a number ending in '680' in early 2007. Despite poisonous rumours and speculation by people who lack real insight into the crime, there is no evidence at all against Madeleine's parents Gerry and Kate. They were clearly not involved in any way with her disappearance. But Portuguese police made a grave error by failing to treat them as suspects immediately. That is simply good practice: they should have systematically eliminated those closest to the child from their inquiries to clear the ground from under their feet. Instead police started with the assumption that a stranger had abducted her. When that theory faltered, they aggressively turned their focus on the McCanns. Gerry and Kate were in an impossible situation, at the centre of a worldwide media storm and out of their minds with worry for their daughter. When they were declared formal suspects, or arguidos, whatever they did was bound to be criticised. So what is the truth of Madeleine's disappearance? The mistake most investigators have made was to assume she was taken from her bed in the apartment. In fact, it is far more likely that Maddie left on her own. That morning, she had said that her brother and sister, twins Sean and Amelie, two, had woken up during the previous evening while the adults were out at dinner, and that their crying disturbed her. What would be more natural than for Madeleine, woken again by her brother or sister, to go looking for her parents? Perhaps she turned the wrong way as she left the flat and wandered into the car park. Wherever she was, a predatory stranger saw her and acted on impulse. One of the McCanns' friends, Jane Tanner, thought she saw a man carrying a small child in pyjamas when she went at 9.15pm to check the children were sleeping. Perhaps that was the abductor - or perhaps no one saw him at all. This kind of opportunistic crime is very rare but not unknown. My hunch is that more than one person knows what happened to Madeleine. I live in hope that the silence could break, as allegiances shift or attitudes change. Phone records show categorically that, between 7.32pm and 8.02pm, this number was in use to another Portuguese phone, ending in '683'. It has been widely reported that analysis of the signal places the '680' number very close to the Ocean Club, perhaps even outside the McCanns' window. To add to the circumstantial evidence, the '683' number I have linked to a sex offender whose activity on the internet's 'dark web' sites is also heavily linked to child abusers. But there's a major problem. I cannot find any evidence '680' was ever Brueckner's regular number, in fact I have found contra evidence. The German police have just one witness, a woman who says she called '680' and spoke to Brueckner. With so much publicity around the case, I would expect to see many people coming forward to confirm that the suspect was using this number. In fact, there is irrefutable evidence from multiple witnesses that '680' was regularly used by a different man, a close friend of Brueckner's who was also based in south Portugal. Paperwork and an official document that I have seen show this was his phone - not Brueckner's. So it can't be established the suspect was even using '680' on the evening Madeleine was taken. My investigation has demolished this evidence in a second way. We know the phone call at 7.32pm 'pinged' off a mast 200 yards from the Ocean Club. But that doesn't mean the user was nearby as the mast has a range of up to 21 miles. When mobiles 'talk' to two or three masts, it is often possible to locate them by triangulation. That is not what happened here. The bare fact is that someone, almost certainly not Brueckner, received a 30-minute call on '680' somewhere in south Portugal that evening. This is not compelling evidence and actually makes the phone number ending '680' irrelevant. My findings have been presented to the German authorities who say they are not bothered by the phone mast evidence. Nor do they seem concerned at the unreliability of the convicted drug dealer and people trafficker who claims Brueckner confessed in a bar in 2008 to killing Madeleine. His name is Helge Busching and he is, quite simply, a fantasist. One informant showed me a video of Busching in paramilitary kit, spouting nonsense about the case. Busching and an associate, Manfred Seyferth, told police they saw videos filmed by Brueckner as he beat and raped a 72-year-old woman. Those tapes have never been produced. Busching lacks real credibility and should be treated very cautiously as a witness. Even his initial statement to police is a major concern because he was given payment for information. It could be argued Busching and Seyferth would say almost anything for money. Busching has said he will give an interview for 50,000 euros to be paid into the McCanns' fighting fund - a bizarre stipulation. So far, he has had no takers. Brueckner has repeatedly offered to be interviewed and then withdrawn. I wrote to him in prison, and eventually he agreed to see me. That was vetoed by the German authorities but Brueckner did write a four-page letter in which he admitted living in Praia da Luz in the early 2000s before being jailed for sex offences. He insisted that, after his release in 2006, he did not return to the resort. Instead, he started importing and dealing drugs from his camper van along the coast. One of his prime sites, he said, was Barranco Beach, 20km (12 miles) from Praia da Luz. That is corroborated by a photo of his van by the cliffs there. 'I was selling drugs on a large scale,' he wrote. 'I'd make trips back and forth to Spain, bringing drugs back, marijuana, making a good living.' That tallies with his criminal record: his first arrest for drug dealing came after 2007. The letter contained another assertion that could exonerate him completely. Brueckner claims he has an alibi. During the week when Madeleine went missing, he was in a brief relationship with a 17-year-old German on holiday with her parents. Each night, she would leave their lodgings and spend several hours with Brueckner in his van. Her family was staying in Carvoeiro, about 44km (27 miles) from Praia da Luz - about 40 minutes by road. Each evening he would leave the beach, drive into the town, park and leave at 10am. Flight records show this family was in the Algarve that week. And that on May 10 the girl came to the notice of police as she was illegally carrying a pepper spray. I have tracked down this woman, now 32, to a small town in Germany. She is very reluctant to take part in the inquiry, though if she is formally called by the police she will have to give evidence at trial. That evidence surely rules out Brueckner. I confirm that, although she cannot say exactly what they were doing on May 3, she is sure his behaviour showed no changes or signs of stress that week. And even more significant is that in the days after Madeleine disappeared, Brueckner was driving around in the van in which she was apparently abducted Is it conceivable that this man drove to Praia da Luz, kidnapped a three-year-old some time after 9pm, abused and probably killed her, disposed of her body and then drove for more than half-an-hour, to meet his girlfriend? Could he have acted as though nothing had occurred? I must reiterate that Brueckner groomed and abused children. But there is a massive difference between committing these offences and the abduction and murder of a child. Nothing I have seen suggests he has a predilection to kill, let alone that he could carry out so hideous an act and then behave, an hour later, as if nothing had happened. None of the supposed evidence against him stands up. No wonder over two years on, the German prosecutors have not charged him. I have no evidence Brueckner is responsible for the abduction and murder of Madeleine McCann. Maddie suspect's shock alibi claim By Vanessa Allen  The prime suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann has finally given a detailed alibi for the night the little girl vanished. Christian Brueckner insists he was with a 17-year-old girl and miles away from Praia da Luz when Madeleine went missing. According to a new documentary, she backs his story. The German paedophile drifter told the TV crew that the teen, on a family holiday in Portugal from Germany, stayed in his camper van on the night of May 3, 2007. The pair were stopped and photographed at a police roadblock the next day, he said. Although his alibi does not cover the time Madeleine vanished, former detective Mark Williams-Thomas believes it raises serious questions over whether Brueckner could have taken her and disposed of her body before meeting his fling two hours later. If true, the account could destroy hopes that police were close to solving the mystery of what happened to Madeleine, three, who vanished from her parents' Algarve holiday apartment 15 years ago today. Mr Williams-Thomas reveals today that Brueckner - now 44 - wrote him a four-page letter detailing his alibi which 'blows to smithereens' the case against him. Writing in today's Daily Mail, Mr Williams-Thomas said he had tracked down the woman identified by Brueckner. He also questioned the mobile phone evidence which allegedly placed Brueckner in Praia da Luz on the night Madeleine vanished. Brueckner, in prison for rape in Germany, was made an arguido, or official suspect, by Portuguese police last month. German prosecutors had previously said they believed he took and killed Madeleine. He has been interviewed by the German authorities but reportedly refused to answer questions about his whereabouts on the night of the disappearance, although he has denied he was involved. The convicted sex offender has now told the film-makers that he was selling drugs in the Algarve and was in a brief relationship with the 17-year-old during the week Madeleine went missing. The teen's family was staying a 40-minute drive from Praia da Luz, and Brueckner said he drove there nightly to meet her. Mr Williams-Thomas said the woman, now 32 and living in Germany, told how Brueckner's behaviour did not change in the days after Madeleine's disappearance. According to police, mobile phone data puts Brueckner's mobile in Praia da Luz on the night Madeleine vanished. But Mr Williams-Thomas said he had seen evidence that the phone in question was regularly used by a different man. Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry are expected to mark the 15th anniversary of their daughter's disappearance at home in Rothley, Leicestershire, with her younger siblings, twins Sean and Amelie.",

Grace Kelley, 26, the daughter of Wynonna Judd, never asked to be released from behind bars in Tennessee, Dorinda Carter, spokeswoman for the state Department of Correction, told DailyMail.com. 'We have not received a request,' Carter said. 'No one has asked.' The Grammy-winning singer died of suicide at the age of 76 on Saturday after a lifelong bout with severe depression. She was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame on Sunday.  It's unclear when her funeral will be held.  Kelley was arrested in 2020, and sentenced to eight years behind bars. She was granted parole in 2021, but was soon back in prison after violating her parole conditions.  Carter said that the warden of the Debra K. Johnson Rehabilitation Center in Nashville often entertains furloughing inmates for extreme circumstances like a death in the family so that she may attend a church service or a wake in a funeral home. The request can come from a family member, lawyers or 'the inmate herself,' Carter said, but no one asked. Kelley has been in trouble with the law for several years. She was first arrested around the time of her 20th birthday in June 2016 for the manufacture, distribution and sale of methamphetamine, according to Tennessee Department of Correction records. After pleaded guilty, she served 30 days was let go on probation a year later. Kelley could not stay clean, however, and was rearrested in April 2020, violating the terms of her probation. She was released again in April 2021 under the condition that she go through drug rehabilitation and submit to a regular drug test. Again in December 2021, she violated the terms of her release and was sentenced to serve the remainder of her term behind bars.  Her next parole hearing date is set for December of this year and her final release date will be in April 2024. Grace, and her brother Elijah, are products of Wynonna Judd's first marriage to businessman Arch Kelly III. The couple divorced in 1998 after three years of marriage. Her mother has supported her through all of her legal turmoil. 'I will tell you this. My daughter is the strongest Judd woman in our 'herstory,' she told Fox News in February 2020. 'She's healthier than I was at 23. How she got there - I would not go that way, but I was also sequestered.' 'That could have been me if I didn't have music,' she added. ",
  "a3136816be87722d178799e94957f3449efd037435a3e4600175406f": "The Federal Communications Commission has said it would be 'un-American' to interfere with Elon Musk's $44billion Twitter deal. Commissioner Nathan Simington issued a press release on Monday dismissing requests for the agency to stop Elon Musk from acquiring Twitter. He warned the agency would not intervene and said he did not have the authority to weigh in on the blockbuster acquisition and added it would be 'unconstitutional'. Musk confirmed his mammoth takeover at the end of last month and has vowed to release the shackles 'woke' bosses have put on free speech on the site. It has been met with fury by some who fear the social media giant would further sour if people could post more freely. 1.  The FCC's 'review authority does not and has never extended to internet platforms like Twitter.' 2. 'Even if it did, it would be inappropriate and contrary to the public interest to block it, and it would harm consumers.' 3. 'Nothing about Musk becoming the sole owner of Twitter would be out of step with the ownership structures of other social media platforms or. Google, YouTube, Facebook, the Washington Post, and the New York Times are each owned or controlled by one or two people or a single family.' 4. 'It would be not only unconstitutional [and illegal], but plainly un-American, for any arm of the government to act against Twitter or Mr. Musk for such a purpose.' Source: FCC Simingtong wrote: 'The FCC cannot, and should not, block this sale. We should instead applaud Mr. Musk for doing something about a serious problem that government has so far failed to address.' He continued: '...I am particularly troubled by arguments that the federal government must act with the purpose of stopping Mr. Musk from enshrining free expression on Twitter. The only merit in such proposals is their candor in proposing something so blatantly illegal.  'It would be not only unconstitutional, but plainly un-American, for any arm of the government to act against Twitter or Mr. Musk for such a purpose.'   Simington said the FCC did not have authority to regulate internet platforms like Twitter, but even if it did, there was 'no reason to think the deal would limit competition or harm consumers.' The commissioner seemingly sided with Musk and even ventured to suggest that 'restrictive, and often politically motivated, content moderation practices,' were affecting consumer choice and freedom of speech.  Simington added the purchase did not raise concerns of horizontal or vertical concentration in the social media market - terms that refer to companies' strategists to merge and regulate stages of their production instead of relying on suppliers.  The release comes after 'some called on the FCC to stop Elon Musk from acquiring Twitter,' according to Simington. It is unclear who he referred to, DailyMail.com has reached out for comment. Musk, the world's richest man, currently owns a 9.2 per cent stake in the tech giant and is trying to take it private with an unsolicited bid of $54.20 per share. To buy Twitter the 50-year-old committed $21 billion in equity, $13 billion from Morgan Stanley in debt facilities and another $12.5 billion from the bank and others in margin loans. But 'a portion' of his shares in Tesla have been put forward as collateral, which analysts feared could have a huge impact on the firm. Musk filed a document with the US. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 21 showing how he planned to take over Twitter for about $44 billion.  'If Mr. Musk follows through on his stated intention to ease Twitter's restrictions on speech, he would almost certainly enhance competition and better serve those Americans, the majority, who value free speech,' Simington wrote on Monday.  The FCC commissioner said that despite reports of concerns that Musk becoming the sole owner of Twitter 'would be out of step with the ownership structures of other social media platforms,' that was the case for many platforms.  'Google, YouTube, Facebook, the Washington Post, and the New York Times are each owned or controlled by one or two people or a single family,' Simington argued.  Concerns of Musk controlling both Twitter and Starlink were also dismissed as 'not serious,' with Simington rebutting that there are plenty of examples of common ownership and control of broadband internet and online services like streaming platforms, and news websites.  Musk seemingly reacted to the news that the FCC wouldn't interfere with his deal by sharing a rather particular meme on his Twitter feed.  'As I was saying,' Musk captioned a picture of a hand flicking a tiger's bollocks, which read '2022, here we go.'   Musk has laid out some bold, if still vague, plans for transforming Twitter into a place of 'maximum fun' once he buys the social media platform for $44 billion and takes it private. But enacting what at the moment are little more than a mix of vague principles and technical details could be considerably more complicated than he suggests. Twitter workers have already warned of a 'mass exodus' of staff when he takes over the company, with one describing the world's richest man as 'a person with questionable ethics'. At an 'all-hands' meeting via videolink last week, hosted by CEO Parag Agrawal and Bret Taylor, the chair of the board, questions submitted by staff during the 45-minute meeting were read out by the chief marketing officer, Leslie Berland. One question asked in a recording obtained by Project Veritas was: 'How does the board and Mr Musk plan on dealing with a mass exodus considering the acquisition is by a person with questionable ethics?' Taylor replied that 'one of the themes of today is continuity'. He said: 'The question of attrition: As Parag stated, one of the themes of today is continuity, and ensuring that Parag and this leadership team continues to operate the business successfully on behalf of our users, on behalf of our customers, and that has obviously been a big topic of discussion at the board.  'And as I mentioned, an area that is important to Elon Musk as well, because of the importance of Twitter as a service.' Agrawal said he had seen many questions about the process, about share schemes, and about working conditions in the future. He said much was still to be clarified. Staff were told there would be no layoffs 'at this time' - but no guarantees were provided when Musk takes over. But in a sign of the possible internal unrest, new product launches were delayed amid fears, Bloomberg speculated, that employees could 'go rogue' and 'push something or mess with the product on the way out the door.'  Agrawal told employees that their stock options would convert to cash when the deal with Musk closes, which he estimated would take three to six months. According to The New York Times, he also said that they would continue to receive bonuses according to Twitter's vesting schedule.  Employees would receive their same benefits packages for a year after the deal was finalized, Agrawal added.  He said he would try and arrange a staff forum with Musk, and said that he would remain at the company as CEO, at least until the deal was finalized. 'He wants Twitter to be a powerful, positive force in the world, just like all of us,' Agrawal said of Musk.  'He believes Twitter matters.' He urged employees to 'operate Twitter as we always have,' adding that 'how we run the company, the decisions we make and the positive changes we drive -- that will be on us, and under our control.' Twitter employees are sharing their concerns in internal chatrooms, messages seen by the New York Post show.  'We're all going through the five stages of grief in cycles and everyone's nerves are frazzled,' one senior staff software engineer reportedly wrote on the company's internal Slack channel. The staffer called Musk an 'a**hole,' and tried to console his colleagues. 'We're all spinning our wheels, and coming up with worst case scenarios (Trump returns! No more moderation!). 'The fact is that [Musk] has not talked about what he's planning on doing in any detail outside of broad sweeping statements that could be easily seen as hyperbolic showboating,' he added. One site reliability engineer wrote that it was 'physically cringey watching Elon talk about free speech.' A senior staff video engineer announced his plans to quit, saying: 'Not the place to say it perhaps, but I will not work for this company after the takeover.' The employee unrest begun as soon as Musk's successful takeover was confirmed on Monday.  'I feel like im going to throw up..I rly don't wanna work for a company that is owned by Elon Musk,' one staffer said, according to New York Times reporter Talmon Smith. Smith's source told him that it was 'absolutely insane' in the internal chat rooms. Another Twitter employee reportedly complained: 'I don't rly know what I'm supposed to do...oh my god, my phone's been blowing up...We have a meeting about it at 5pm...the CEO is going to address everyone about it' (it=elon). 'I hate him, why does he even want this?' Musk vowed to protect free speech on Twitter, 'defeat the spam bots' and 'authenticate all humans' as he welcomed the acquisition. He also revealed he planned to 'enhance the product with new features' and 'make the algorithms open source to increase trust'. But within the company, there was turmoil at the announcement. 'I feel like he's this petulant little boy and that he's doing this to troll...he doesn't know anything about our policies and what we do...his statement about our algo was f****** insane...  'Were just gonna let everyone run amok?...nobody knows,' the employee said, according to the New York Times. Some Twitter staff were 'openly rebelling' against Musk, one observer noted, posting a screen shot of Twitter's official Github site and posting a public response entitled 'The Algorithm' - with zero code.  By The Associated Press FREE SPEECH TOWN SQUARE Musk's feistiest priority - but also the one with the vaguest roadmap - is to make Twitter a 'politically neutral' digital town square for the world's discourse that allows as much free speech as each country's laws allow. He's acknowledged that his plans to reshape Twitter could anger the political left and mostly please the right. He hasn't specified exactly what he'll do about former President Donald Trump's permanently banned account or other right-wing leaders whose tweets have run afoul of the company's restrictions against hate speech, violent threats or harmful misinformation. Should Musk go this direction, it could mean bringing back not only Trump, but 'many, many others that were removed as a result of QAnon conspiracies, targeted harassment of journalists and activists, and of course all of the accounts that were removed after Jan. 6,' said Joan Donovan, who studies misinformation at Harvard University. 'That could potentially be hundreds of thousands of people.' Musk hasn't ruled out suspending some accounts, but says such bans should be temporary. His latest criticism has centered around what he described as Twitter's 'incredibly inappropriate' 2020 blocking of a New York Post article on Hunter Biden, which the company has said was a mistake and corrected within 24 hours. OPEN-SOURCED ALGORITHMS Musk's longstanding interest in AI is reflected in one of the most specific proposals he outlined in his merger announcement - the promise of 'making the algorithms open source to increase trust.' He's talking about the systems that rank content to decide what shows up on users' feeds. Partly driving the distrust, at least for Musk supporters, is lore among U.S. political conservatives about 'shadow banning' on social media. This is a supposed invisible feature for reducing the reach of badly behaving users without disabling their accounts. There has been no evidence that Twitter's platform is biased against conservatives; studies have found the opposite when it comes to conservative media in particular. Musk has called for posting the underlying computer code powering Twitter's news feed for public inspection on the coder hangout GitHub. But such 'code-level transparency' gives users little insight into how Twitter is working for them without the data the algorithms are processing, said Nick Diakopoulos, a Northwestern University computer scientist. Diakopoulos said there are good intentions in Musk's broader goal to help people find out why their tweets get promoted or demoted and whether human moderators or automated systems are making those choices. But that's no easy task. Too much transparency about how individual tweets are ranked, for instance, can make it easier for 'disingenuous people' to game the system and manipulate an algorithm to get maximum exposure for their cause, Diakopoulos said. `DEFEATING THE SPAM BOTS' 'Spam bots' that mimic real people have been a personal nuisance to Musk, whose popularity on Twitter has inspired countless impersonator accounts that use his image and name - often to promote cryptocurrency scams that look as if they're coming from the Tesla CEO. Sure, Twitter users, among them Musk, 'don't want spam,' said David Greene, civil liberties director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. But who defines what counts as a spam bot? 'Do you mean all bots like, you know, if I follow a Twitter bot that just pulls up historic photos of fruits? I choose to follow that. Is that not allowed to exist?' he said. There are also plenty of spam-filled Twitter accounts at least partially run by real people that run the gamut from ones that hawk products to those promoting polarizing political content to meddle in other countries' elections. `AUTHENTICATE ALL HUMANS' Musk has repeatedly said he wants Twitter to 'authenticate all humans,' an ambiguous proposal that could be related to his desire to rid the website of spam accounts. Ramping up mundane identity checks - such as two-factor authentication or popups that ask which of six photos shows a school bus - could discourage anyone from trying to amass an army of bogus accounts. Musk might also be considering offering more people a 'blue check' - the verification checkmark sported on notable Twitter accounts - like Musk's - to show they're who they say they are. Musk has suggested users could buy the checkmarks as part of a premium service. But some digital rights activists are concerned these measures could lead to a 'real-name' policy resembling Facebook's approach of forcing people to validate their full names and use them in their profiles. That would seem to contradict Musk's free speech focus by muzzling anonymous whistleblowers or people living under authoritarian regimes where it can be dangerous if a dissident message is attributable to a particular person. AD-FREE TWITTER? Musk has floated the idea of an ad-free Twitter, though it wasn't one of the priorities outlined in the official merger announcement. That may be because cutting off the company's chief way of making money would be a tall order, even for the world's richest person. Advertisements accounted for more than 92% of Twitter's revenue in the January-March fiscal quarter. The company did last year launch a premium subscription service - known as Twitter Blue - but doesn't appear to have made much headway in getting people to pay for it. Musk has made clear he favors a stronger subscription-based model for Twitter that gives more people an ad-free option. That would also fit into his push to relax Twitter's content restrictions - which brands largely favor because they don't want their ads surrounded by offensive and hate-filled tweets.  ",

Mayor Gennady Trukhanov said people across his country had been 'impressed' by the Prime Minister's 'strong stance in protecting and helping Ukraine'. In an interview with the Daily Mail, he added: 'I am going to suggest that we rename one of the streets or squares here in Odesa after Boris Johnson. 'I want to express my deep gratitude to Great Britain for taking such a principled and tough position, and in particular to your Prime Minister who calls things as they are.' Russia has been firing missiles at Odesa - Ukraine's largest port and third- biggest city - in a bid to seize it and cut off the country's vital access to the Black Sea to cripple the economy. One rocket attack destroyed a runway at Odesa's airport, the Ukrainian army said on Saturday. Regional governor Maksym Marchenko added that the rocket was fired from Russian-occupied Crimea and that there were no reports of injuries. Local authorities urged residents to take shelter as the Ukrainian news agency, citing army sources, said that several explosions were heard in Odesa. Mr Johnson had tweeted late on Saturday after talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky how he was 'more committed than ever' to 'ensuring Putin fails'. Mr Trukhanov, 57, an ex-army captain, also took a thinly veiled swipe at Brussels for failing to slap an immediate total ban on all Russian energy exports. 'Today, some EU countries are counting how much gas will cost, how much petrol will cost,' he said. 'We cannot put a price on freedom.' EU governments have paid more than PS39billion to Moscow to buy fossil fuels since the invasion of Ukraine on February 24, according to a think-tank, the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. Romanian MEP Cristian Terhes praised Mr Trukhanov's idea, saying 'it would be a great way to recognise how the UK helped Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression'.  He added: 'While Brussels is full of empty talk, Brexit Britain is a true global player opposing Putin's invasion in every aspect.' Fontanka, a village 12 miles to the north, has already taken the step of honouring Mr Johnson but Odesa is the first major Ukrainian city to announce plans to follow suit. Sources close to Mr Trukhanov said the idea would be put forward to the city council once martial law in Ukraine is scrapped. Aides added that the plan is likely to be approved unopposed. Sergei Boyko, 32, a local doctor, said the move would be very popular. 'Ukrainians will always remember Boris Johnson as the one who helped us in our darkest hour,' he said. Britain has been one of the leaders in the West's response to Russia's invasion, having started training the country's military the year after Moscow's illegal 2014 annexation of Crimea. The Government has sent PS450million in military aid to the Ukrainian army, including thousands of missiles. But even as Putin amassed tens of thousands of troops along Ukraine's borders in January, French president Emmanuel Macron accused Mr Johnson and US President Joe Biden of 'alarmism'. French spy chief General Eric Vidaud resigned in March over the huge intelligence failure.",
  "2db84c859ac581587fcb3a6f6501e3a3879ac0a5ca6a125a4b5b5b36": "A dictionary definition of the word dissemble is to hide or conceal facts or information. To deliberately obscure the whole truth. For a prime example of a habitual dissembler, look no further than Sir Keir Starmer. On a raft of key questions, the Labour leader and his entourage have either played a dead bat or offered a stream of shifty half-truths. Only when their sins of omission are found out, frequently by this newspaper, does the truth emerge. Sir Keir has been wriggling like a worm on a hook over the beer and Indian takeaway bash he enjoyed in Durham with Labour activists during lockdown. Speaking to LBC radio on January 17, he strongly implied that only six or seven people were present. Yet the restaurant delivery driver told the Daily Mail there might have been as many as 30. Mysteriously, the driver later had a sudden attack of amnesia. But if Labour have nothing to hide, why won't they just say how many were there? It's not a difficult question. And did Sir Keir and his team really carry on working afterwards, as he claims? Where's the proof? A video shows beer was still being drunk at 10.04pm. After a long day, replete with curry and no doubt drowsy after a beer or two, it's hard to imagine they had much stamina left. Meanwhile, having first denied that deputy leader Angela Rayner was present at the gathering, he now admits she was. With his usual bluster he says it was a 'genuine mistake'. But why did he fail to correct it for months after flatly denying her presence to the Mail in January? It was only video evidence that shamed him into admitting it at all. Durham police's abject failure to reopen investigations into 'Beergate' is also scandalous. Could the fact that their police and crime commissioner was a Labour councillor have any bearing? That Sir Keir can castigate Boris Johnson for alleged dishonesty over lockdown breaches is nothing less than brass-necked effrontery. But this is his modus operandi - assume the moral high ground, smear your opponent, then look offended if anyone suggests your own conduct may not be whiter than white. And if you are put under pressure, change the subject. Having banged on for months about Downing Street's lockdown breaches, all he wants to talk about is the cost of living crisis now that he's in the similar crosshairs. Sir Keir has a habit of piously saying, 'I take full responsibility' - then doesn't. It's fitting that he received a glossy video endorsement yesterday from the arch-dissembler himself, Tony Blair, 25 years to the day since he took New Labour to power. Now there's a man who really knows about being economical with the truth. Sir Keir could use him as a model. A Tory with backbone Any true Conservative will be cheered by rumours that Lord Frost may be prepared to set aside his peerage and stand for Parliament in one of two forthcoming by-elections. He is being tipped for the safe Tory seat of Tiverton and Honiton after the departure of porn-watching MP Neil Parish. As chief negotiator for exiting the EU, Lord Frost was instrumental in getting Brexit done. He stood firm against Brussels bullying over the Northern Ireland protocol. Being from Nottingham, he understands Red Wall priorities, believes passionately in a low-tax/high-growth economy and is strongly opposed to spurious green taxes. He is untried as an elected politician, of course. But from everything we know so far, he seems to have exactly the sense of Tory mission - and backbone - the Government needs.",
  "80842f12566f5e2af723a395d39b2b81af3373a8424af6054086d2c7": "A council has been accused of trying to 'remove history' by voting to take down a statue of a black boy from a historic building. The potential removal of the 'racist' Blackboy clock statue in Stroud, Gloucestershire, comes after campaigners argued it was 'traumatic for people of colour'. But the town's Conservative MP, Siobhan Baillie, said: 'I oppose [the] removal of history and statues. 'To do so serves no purpose other than to allow some people to decide or be selective with history, or decide what is most comfortable and causes no offence.' Stroud District Council voted overwhelmingly to 'pursue' taking down the 250-year-old statue, which depicts a child with red lips and a leaf skirt holding a club. But the council - run by a Labour-led coalition - may not have the power to compel the Blackboy Clock Trust, which owns the clock on a Grade II listed building, to remove it.  And the decision can be blocked by Communities Secretary Michael Gove if there is an objection from Historic England, under a law passed last year. The heritage body has said taking it down would 'harm both the significance of the listed building and the character of the conservation area and would also seriously damage the integrity of the clock itself'. A council meeting on Thursday heard that removing the statue and placing it in a museum, which councillors 'strongly recommended', would cost PS33,500.  Labour councillor Natalie Bennett said: 'As far as we know there has been no precedent set for this because the change in the law is so recent, so it would probably be a test case.' More than 1,600 residents took part in an eight-week consultation and 77 per cent said they wanted it removed. Council leader Doina Cornell said the decision was 'us listening to the community'.  But Tory councillor Haydn Sutton said: 'Why are we sweeping history under the carpet? I've spoken to lots of people and they say it should stay.' The clock, created in 1774, is one of Britain's 20 surviving jack clocks, which feature a moving figure striking a bell on the hour.  The first complaint about the statue came last year by an activist inspired by Black Lives Matter protests. Polly Stratton, of Stroud Against Racism, said the statue was 'traumatic for people of colour'.  She added: 'We're not trying to hide it or tear it down. We want it on public display in a museum.'",

He described Whitechapel in East London as an 'aggressively Muslim' neighbourhood in a tweet on January 22, 2013. On May 27, 2011, he complained about a 'big black man' taking up room on a bus. When Normal was campaigning in the past for re-election he was using the same Twitter account with which he'd made the offensive remarks. After the old tweets resurfaced, he tweeted to say sorry: 'I sincerely apologise to everyone who has seen them and who I have insulted by their contents.' The revelations will do little to help Labour rehabilitate itself after Corbyn -- something which Starmer has been desperately trying to achieve. Labour MP Jess Phillips is, predictably, no fan of Boris Johnson. 'I've met pot plants that could compete with Boris Johnson's Oxford debating skills,' she says. 'He is a genuinely dreadful Commons performer.' Has the porn-shame Tory MP Neil Parish made a small piece of literary history?  The comedian David Baddiel asks: 'Will 'I was looking at tractors' become a national catchphrase?'  Comedian Eddie Izzard has been on the campaign trail in Sheffield for the party's South Yorkshire mayoral candidate Oliver Coppard. Izzard, who prefers to be identified as 'she' and 'her' these days, is desperate to become an MP. The Sheffield Central MP Paul Blomfield is standing down at the next election so his 27,000 majority will be a tempting proposition for Izzard. But will the local Labour Party want serial loser Izzard, who spent PS36,000 -- including PS22,000 on transport and food -- in a doomed nationwide campaign to stop Brexit? An avowed republican, Izzard also campaigned unsuccessfully to change the 'first past the post' voting system to the Alternative Vote (AV) in the 2011 referendum. Labour's culture spokeswoman Lucy Powell last week secured an emergency Commons debate on the Government decision to privatise Channel 4. What she failed to declare at the start of the speech was the gifted trip to the Baftas worth PS2,140 that she received from the TV network. Perhaps she had forgotten? Unlikely -- the Baftas were in March.  Lib Dem deputy leader Daisy Cooper has been calling for any MPs linked to sexual harassment to be banned from Parliament for good. That is, it seems, unless they're Lib Dem. Lord Rennard, former Lib Dem chief executive, was suspended from the party in 2014 after four women activists made sexual harassment allegations against him -- which he has denied -- only to be reinstated seven months later. A service of thanksgiving for the life of the civil servant Sir John Chilcot is being held in Westminster Abbey this month. It was Chilcot's devastating 2016 report into the Iraq War which concluded that Tony Blair agreed to the invasion before peaceful options had been exhausted.  It also argued the threat posed by Iraq's so-called 'weapons of mass destruction' was presented with a 'certainty that was not justified'. In short, Chilcot's report trashed Blair's legacy. As a former PM, Blair will be invited to the service. But will he go?",
  "17ec54dcf4c680183a0bdf230280929ba95f8926541a5024bdaa1083": "Moscow's claims of what it might do to the UK, in retaliation for our support of Ukraine's fight against the Russian invader, get more blood-curdling by the day. Last week one of Russian state TV's most popular programmes showed a map of Europe, and in how short a time various cities could, allegedly, be demolished by Moscow's hypersonic nuclear missile, Sarmat, when fired from the western-most Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. Alexei Zhuravlev exclaimed: 'One Sarmat and that's it -- the British Isles are no more.' Another angry presenter on the programme boasted it would take one of these missiles '202 seconds to hit London' from Kaliningrad. In fact, there is no missile launch site in Kaliningrad, or anywhere near it. And last week the Pentagon's press secretary, John Kirby, said that the earlier test launch of Sarmat 'was not deemed to be a threat to the United States or its allies'. Make of that what you will; but it seemed that the Pentagon, not known for its relaxed attitude to Russian military capabilities, was saying that Moscow's latest threat was empty (while terrifying). Indeed, the performance of the Russian military to date, in its invasion of Ukraine, has been startling only in its primitiveness. The same Russian state TV had claimed, just before the invasion, that Kyiv would fall 'within 11 minutes'. This, or something like it, may have been what President Vladimir Putin himself believed, having been promised that by his military commanders. Fantasies That is what happens in a country where deception is the governing principle of communication, from top to bottom. Flattering fantasies come to be believed, and the truth is never acceptable: it would be more than someone's job is worth to tell it. This sort of thing is not unknown in the West -- British Prime Ministers and American Presidents are frequently told what their advisers think they want to hear. But ours are societies with a querulously independent press and a firm tradition of legal protection for the rights of the individual against the state. Russia has never had that. As a result, its leaders can get away with any lie, however outrageous, in part because of the undoubtedly intense patriotism of the typical Russian, who equates this with faith in the ruler -- and always has. Among the more risible such lies recently propagated on Russian state television was the claim, just before the invasion of Ukraine (you know, the invasion which in February Putin repeatedly told visiting Western leaders would never happen), that the British Royal Family had been pushing the idea of 'a war with Ukraine', in order to deflect attention from the travails of Prince Andrew -- and that this somehow determined the behaviour of the British government. When telling the Russian people this, Dmitry Kiselyov, known as 'Putin's mouthpiece', almost certainly didn't believe it himself. But that is the point. As the former Moscow bureau chief of the Financial Times, Charles Clover, explained some years ago: 'Putin has correctly surmised that lies unite rather than divide Russia's political class. The greater and more obvious the lie, the more his subjects demonstrate their loyalty by accepting it, and the more they participate in the great sacral mystery of Kremlin power.' The most grotesque lies are as much designed to demonise the Kremlin's enemies, as to boost the mystical power of the country's ruler. Thus the Ukrainian government of President Volodymyr Zelensky has been described -- again on Russian state television -- as one comprising (variously), Nazis, drug addicts, Satan-worshippers, and Masonic sodomites. This approach is not just that of attention-seeking TV presenters. Major General Igor Konashenkov, the chief spokesman for the Russian military, in one of his recent briefings, insisted that the Ukrainians had been supplied by the U.S. military with a troupe of migratory birds trained to fly to Russia, where our feathered friends would drop 'bioweapons'. This is a distant echo of Operation Infektion, the KGB disinformation campaign to propagate the idea that the CIA created the AIDS virus as part of a biological weapons project. It was designed to stir up popular anger at U.S. military bases during the cold war, portrayed by the KGB as the cause of AIDS outbreaks in local populations. Contempt The monstrous lie was successfully spread across the world by the KGB, and may well have contributed to the refusal of the Moscow-trained South African President Thabo Mbeki to accept the true cause of the virus that was killing millions of his countrymen. The consequence was appalling. It is obviously significant that Putin was a KGB officer. As the emigre Russian novelist Vladimir Sorokin wrote at the outset of the Ukraine invasion, described by the Kremlin as 'a special operation': 'For Putin, life itself has always been a special operation. From the black order of the KGB, he learned not only contempt for 'normal people', but also its main principle: not a single word of truth.' But it would be wrong to see the culture of 'not a single word of truth' as peculiar to the KGB, or as a legacy of the period of Communist rule. It goes much deeper and further back than that. One of the most remarkable books on the subject was Astolphe de Custine's Letters From Russia. This was the result of a stay in this vast country by that French aristocrat in 1839. De Custine went there as a sympathiser with the idea of a nation under the firm rule of a Tsar: not surprisingly, since both his father and grandfather had been guillotined in the wake of the French Revolution. Yet he discovered, to his shock, what the effects were of Tsarist autocratic rule on the character of the Russian people. De Custine encountered a liberal Russian prince, who informed him: 'It has led to a degeneration of language in Russia to the point where speech is now considered merely a trap: our government feeds on lies, because truth frightens the tyrant as it does the slave.' Survival And de Custine himself concluded, at the end of his journey: 'Russians of every class conspire together with wonderful mutual understanding to ensure the triumph of duplicity in their country. They have a dexterity in lying and a natural talent for falsehood, the success of which repels my sincerity as much as it strikes terror in my heart.' He returned to France a convert to the merits of constitutional government. Perhaps the best recent book touching on this phenomenon is Moscow Rules: What Drives Russia To Confront The West, published in 2018. The author, Keir Giles, worked in Moscow during the 1990s, and is now a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House's Russia and Eurasia Programme. Giles observed: 'The English word 'lie' does not convey the wide range of modalities of Russian deception . . . When reviewing an early draft of this book, a Russian academic suggested avoiding the word 'lie' altogether, as its emotive nature in English was not appropriate for describing a shared conspiracy in avoiding the truth as a survival mechanism.' I gained some sense of this when, in the 1970s, my paternal grandfather's first cousin Lev visited the UK for a scientific conference: he was a very senior figure at what was then Leningrad University, and was able to see his British relatives without a KGB minder. Lev was astounded to observe the chaos of the 'winter of discontent' under the then Labour government. His astonishment was because he had read about bodies going unburied, and so on, in Pravda, then the official newspaper of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union -- and had therefore assumed it was not true. But this unexpected discovery did not alter his profound cynicism about the deceitfulness of the rulers of his country. Few have more cause for such absolute lack of faith in the Kremlin's word than the Ukrainian people and their government. For this reason, I cannot imagine the war being concluded soon, or ever, with a formal agreement between the two sides. Kyiv knows better than to take Putin's word for anything, including the time of day. The lies will never stop.",

And what a treat to see - in these photographs taken by the Duchess of Cambridge to mark her daughter's seventh birthday today - the family's adored new pet for the first time. Prince William and Kate have kept their new pup's identity a secret until now. But the Daily Mail can reveal that the little spaniel is named Orla. Kate's three pictures of her spirited daughter - a princess who adores ballet but can also give her brother George a run for his money on the football pitch - capture her natural joie de vivre. Laughing into the lens, Charlotte wears a blue patterned blouse and jumper, and clutches a posy of freshly picked daisies in her hand. Facially the fourth-in-line to the throne bears a striking resemblance to big brother George - but with her mother's brunette hair and green eyes. The pictures were taken at the family's country home Anmer Hall over the weekend, where they were also joined by little Orla. She was given to the family in the summer of 2020 by the duchess's brother, James Middleton. She proved to be a great source of comfort when they lost Lupo, their first black spaniel, in November 2020. Kate and William had doted on Lupo since they got him as a puppy in 2012 - a year after they married. However, they so jealously guarded his privacy that they refused to confirm his identity at first, let alone reveal his name, until Kate let it slip in an incident dubbed 'Puppygate'. While Lupo was the Italian for 'wolf', Orla - whose name has also been kept under wraps for two years - is Celtic in origin and means 'golden princess'. It is not known why the couple chose it but they later said they liked the name Lupo so it may be the same for their new pet.  Lupo the cocker spaniel was given to Kate by her brother James in 2012. He originally bred a litter of puppies from his dog Ella in 2011.  James kept one called Luna but gave brother Lupo to Kate when Prince William, then an RAF search-and-rescue pilot, was deployed to the Falklands. Lupo often appeared in official pictures of the Cambridges, but died aged nine. In an Instagram post the family said: 'He has been at the heart of our family for the past nine years and we will miss him so much.' New pup Orla was also given to the Cambridges by James Middleton, before Lupo died. Now that she is seven, Charlotte is likely to be seen on more royal engagements such as church services. She joined George, eight, for a memorial service for their late great-grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh, in March. She is currently a pupil at Thomas's prep school in Battersea, south-west London. But last month the Mail revealed that she and little brother Prince Louis, four, are set to join George at an exclusive Berkshire school from September. William and Kate have been scouting out both schools and new homes in the countryside close to the duchess's parents, Michael and Carole Middleton. The couple are looking to start a new life in the duchess's home county in order to give their young family the best chance of a relatively normal childhood while they can. Although Anmer Hall was a perfect base when William was working for East Anglia Air Ambulance, now that he and his wife are full-time working royals it is no longer practical for them to regularly travel up to Norfolk at weekends. Keeping all their children at the same school will also help to strengthen the bond between them as they one day take on the challenge of royal roles in a modern age. Earlier this year Prince William revealed that one of the few things they fight about is who gets to choose the music they listen to in the morning. Charlotte, he said, 'loves running around the kitchen in her dresses and ballet stuff and everything'. He added: 'She goes completely crazy with Louis following her around trying to do the same thing. It's a really happy moment where the children just enjoy dancing, messing around and singing.' He said that his daughter likes to play the song Waka Waka by Colombian pop star Shakira. Royal insiders have revealed that William and Kate are eyeing up a move to Adelaide Cottage, a royal family 'grace and favour' property located just 10 minutes' walk from the Queen's residence in Windsor. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are looking for a permanent home to settle their three young kids - George, eight, Charlotte, seven and Louis, four. Adelaide Cottage is said to be the pair's first choice as it has recently been refurbished and would be well-suited to a family of five aiming to move sooner rather than later. Other options on the table, such as Frogmore House which Will and Kate recently visited, are thought to be too expensive to renovate and adapt to comfortably serve as a family home. A royal insider told The Sun: 'Finding a way to make Adelaide Cottage work seems to be the best and only option.  'There are issues with all the other houses, so Adelaide will be the favourite.'  Built in 1831, the cottage is officially owned by the Queen but has long been used as a guesthouse for friends of the royal family. The recent renovations mean the property, named after Queen Adelaide, wife of King William IV, could be ideally suited to the Cambridges who are said to want to send their three young children to the same schools in Windsor. Will and Kate currently move between Anmer Hall at Sandringham in Norfolk, and West London's Kensington Palace, and are now looking for a proper family home. News of the Cambridge's house hunt comes as their daughter Charlotte celebrates her seventh birthday today.

  "884c5d1057af3261cac490ac7db79979c2f04bf2e305b3fdcabd3528": "A ban on imports of Russian oil to the EU by the end of the year - in line with the British commitment - is being considered, two diplomats said yesterday. The development was hinted at after talks between the European Commission and EU member states this weekend. The European Union is preparing a sixth package of sanctions against Russia which is expected to target Russian oil, Russian and Belarusian banks, individuals and companies. The Commission, which is co-ordinating the EU response, held talks dubbed 'confessionals' with small groups of EU countries and aims to firm up its sanctions plan in time for a meeting of EU ambassadors in Brussels on Wednesday. EU energy ministers are also due to meet in the Belgian capital tomorrow to discuss the issue. The diplomats said some EU countries were able to end their use of oil before the end of 2022, but others, particularly more southerly members, were concerned about the impact on prices. Germany, one of the bigger buyers of Russian oil, appeared to be willing to go along with the end-of-2022 cut-off, the diplomats said.  But countries including Austria, Hungary, Italy and Slovakia had reservations.  An adviser to Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Germany backed an EU ban on Russian oil imports but needed a few months to secure alternatives. Some EU countries have proposed opting for a cap on the price they are willing to pay for Russian oil. However, it would still leave them forced to pay higher prices for supplies from elsewhere. Joerg Kukies was quoted by the Financial Times as saying: 'We're asking for a considered wind-down period.  'We want to stop buying Russian oil, but we need a bit of time to make sure we can get other sources of oil into our country.' Mr Kukies said Germany wanted to ensure that a refinery in Schwedt, northeastern Germany, operated by Russian state oil company Rosneft could be supplied with non-Russian oil brought by tankers to Rostock on the Baltic Sea. He told the Financial Times that to allow this, the port of Rostock would have to be deepened and work done on the pipeline linking it to Schwedt.",

Chris Bryant told LBC Radio he was 'shocked' after entering the House of Commons in 2001 and facing the advances of senior politicians. Mr Bryant said he could think of four MPs, who were 'not out', who did this to him since becoming a Member of Parliament.   He added: 'I never felt I was able to report it because you end up being part of the story, and that's the last thing you want. And I think a lot of women have been through that.' Mr Bryant also said: 'I was shocked at the time... none of them are out, of course. I think that now if anybody would do that I would be absolutely robust. I would call the person out immediately and I would make a complaint.' His claims come as MPs face increasing pressure to clean up Westminster politics amid a wave of sordid claims about booze-fuelled behaviour that has left Parliament's reputation in the gutter.  Among the claims are a minister accused of having 'noisy sex' in his parliamentary office, a Tory MP who sent a 'd**k pic' to a female colleague and another who has been given repeated warnings for his use of prostitutes. Another MP is also said to have drunkenly licked men's faces which cavorting in one of Parliament's many bars. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has called for 'radical' reform to working practices, including ending the direct employment of aides by MPs, to make it easier for them to make complaints without fear of losing their jobs. His bid for change was echoed by Andrea Leadsom, the former leader of the Commons, who in 2018 spearheaded the creation of the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS), which looks into claims of bullying and sexual harassment.",

The show, which is being staged at the Gillian Lynne Theatre in Covent Garden and has suffered Covid-related disruption, will end on June 12. Lord Lloyd-Webber said last July that he was determined to open Cinderella in London and had ignored 'siren voices' suggesting he should move it to New York. The Cinderella premiere took place in August last year, having been scheduled for the previous month but delayed because of Covid isolation issues. It opened with an audience capacity of 50 per cent and in December was stopped due to 'Covid-related absences'. At the time, Lord Lloyd-Webber said it was heartbreaking to see the theatre industry decimated by Omicron cancellations, adding that 'no one in the Government listens'. He postponed Cinderella until 2022 'to avoid more disruption' as the number of coronavirus cases soared. Written by Emerald Fennell and starring Carrie Hope Fletcher, Cinderella is described as a 'complete reinvention' of the classic fairytale. In the frequently asked questions section of the website, under a question about bookings after June 12, it says: 'If you have booked directly through our website or LW Theatres, you will be contacted shortly to discuss your options, but don't worry, if you're unable to make an alternative performance, you will not lose your money. 'As you can imagine, the box office team are busy rebooking everyone, so please don't contact them until they've contacted you.

When asked about the risks of war spilling into Ukraine's neighbour after explosions rattled its Transnistria region, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov told a Saudi broadcaster: 'Moldova should worry about their own future. Because they're being pulled into Nato.' Transnistria is a breakaway region in the east of Moldova where ethnic Ukrainians and Russians outnumber Moldovans. The tensions come as Defence Secretary Ben Wallace predicted that Putin could use Russia's Victory Day to announce an intensification of the Ukrainian onslaught - and perhaps an opening of new theatres of war. Mr Wallace said that the Russian president - whose advances in Ukraine are far behind expectations - might declare war on the world's 'Nazis' at the May 9 parade, which sees Moscow mark the Soviet Union's victory over Hitler. Mr Wallace told LBC Radio: 'I would not be surprised... that he is probably going to declare on May Day that 'we are now at war with the world's Nazis and we need to mass mobilise the Russian people'.' He added: 'Putin, having failed in nearly all objectives, may seek to consolidate what he's got... and just be a sort of cancerous growth within the country. 'We have to help Ukrainians effectively get the limpet off the rock and keep the momentum pushing them back.' Analysts had predicted that Putin wanted to be in a position where he could declare some form of victory on May 9. But with Russian progress on the battlefield being less than conclusive, he may now seek to escalate further.",

German police officers have reportedly told a possible witness to be ready to give evidence in court against Christian Brueckner, 45. The turn of events comes almost 15 years to the day that three-year-old Madeleine disappeared while holidaying with her family in Praia da Luz, Portugal, The Mirror reports.  Brueckner was first named as a suspect by German Police in 2020 and is known to be a convicted paedophile. German prosecutors insist they have evidence that Brueckner is responsible for Madeleine's disappearance. Portugese police listed him as an 'arguido' - an official suspect - in her disappearance last month. Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry McCann have never given up hope of finding their daughter alive but are said to have welcomed the news that Brueckner may be charged. The toddler vanished from the apartment she slept in with her two younger siblings on May 3, 2007, as her parents dined at a nearby tapas restaurant. Despite extensive police searches and worldwide media attention, no trace of Madeleine has ever been found. Prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters said that after gathering evidence, his team of investigators are '100% convinced' that Brueckner killed Madeleine. Friends who knew Brueckner during the time he stayed in Portugal in 2007 understand that charges will soon be made. One former friend said: 'I got a call from the Germans asking questions about a previous statement I made. 'They said I should be prepared to come to Germany, possibly at the end of the summer. They said they were hoping to charge Christian with something but didn't go into any more detail.' In addition to kidnapping Madeleine, Brueckner is also a suspect in the rape of an Irish tour rep in 2004 as well as exposing himself to children in a playground. It is not known if the new charges - said to be imminent - relate to Madeleine or the other crimes in which Brueckner is a suspect. Brueckner is serving a seven-year jail term for a brutal 2005 sex attack on a 72-year-old woman and his application for early release has been rejected by the German authorities. Last week, he wrote to MailOnline - along with his supporters around the world - to claim he had nothing to do with Madeleine's disappearance almost 15 years ago. In all the notes - handwritten in near perfect English - Brueckner explains how he feels he is being 'persecuted' by prosecutors and police and even accuses them of 'fitting' him up. 2007 May 3: Gerry and Kate McCann leave their three children, including Maddie, asleep in their hotel apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal.

  "65937ac3150d99eab4d009633422d004d0f33fc73ccbe11e2172ecc6": "Magistrates have had their sentencing powers doubled in a bid to tackle the courts backlog - but barristers warned yesterday the move could trigger a flood of appeals. Criminals will now face sentences of up to a year from today for a single offence, compared with a previous six-month maximum at a magistrates' court. The plans are part of a bid to relieve the huge crown court backlog of cases built up over the pandemic. Until now, magistrates have sent cases to crown courts for sentences longer than six months. It is hoped that dealing with more offences in the lower court will free up time for crown courts to handle complex and serious cases, delivering swifter justice for victims. Justice Secretary Dominic Raab estimates the move will free up 1,700 days of crown court time a year. Yesterday, Mr Raab said: 'Together with an extra 30 Nightingale courtrooms currently open, digital hearings and allowing the crown court to hear as many cases as possible for another financial year, we will deliver swifter and more effective justice for victims.' But barristers fear offenders will launch more appeals against decisions by magistrates, and say the reform first announced in January does not address the shortage of judges and lawyers. Jo Sidhu QC, chairman of the Criminal Bar Association, which represents barristers across England and Wales, said: 'Keeping back more cases in the magistrates may in any event only trigger more appeals to the crown court, adding to the growing lists of outstanding cases and diverting criminal advocates from tackling the pre-existing pile-up of trials. 'There simply aren't enough judges to sit because, as the Ministry of Justice knows full well, it can't recruit sufficient judges who are in very large part drawn from the same diminishing pool of criminal barristers who also prosecute and defend and who are leaving in droves.' Last week, the Government also promised unlimited court sitting days to speed through the backlog of trials. In January the Ministry of Justice launched a national campaign to recruit 4,000 new magistrates specifically targeting young people in a bid to boost diversity. Since then, more than 34,000 people have registered their interest.",

The Duke of Sussex was in his element as he played a friendly game of polo with his old friend Nacho Figueras on Saturday. Harry, 37, grew up playing the game with his older brother Prince William, 39. And he showed that he still has a keen interest since moving to the US, playing with professional polo player and face of Ralph Lauren Figueras at the Santa Barbara Polo and Racquet Club for the annual Harry East Memorial Tournament. The club is not far from Montecito, where Harry and his wife Meghan live with their two children, Archie, who turns three on Friday, and Lilibet, who is ten months old. Taking to Instagram, Figueras posted a snap of the reunion and said: 'Thrilled to be riding alongside my friend, Prince Harry... We've ridden together many times over the years and now we're both parents, it's extra special to be able to spend this time together.' Figueras was among the guests at Harry and Meghan's wedding in May 2018. He is an ambassador for Sentebale, an organisation founded by the prince which is dedicated to helping children and young people who or whose families suffer with HIV and Aids in Lesotho, South Africa. Harry recently attended the Invictus Games at The Hague in the Netherlands with Meghan. During their trip they made a secret stop-off in the UK, where they visited the Queen at Windsor Castle.

The driver estimated there were 'probably about 30 or so people' inside - but he later U-turned on his story. Sir Keir Starmer insisted 'no rules were broken' as he accused the Tories of 'trying to throw mud around' ahead of Thursday's local elections.  The Daily Mail spoke to a staff member at the award-winning The Capital Indian restaurant not far from Durham Miners Hall - where Sir Keir was filmed drinking beer - who initially said he brought 'about four bags' of food.  During the first national lockdown The Capital was hailed by local Labour MP Mary Foy - who was among those at the 10pm gathering in her constituency office - for supplying meals to NHS staff. However, after the Mail continued to make enquiries last night, the delivery driver changed his story, claiming he had never even been to the Miners Hall.  The Labour leader was staying at Durham's Radisson Blu hotel where food was served outside on its terrace until 9pm.  But Sir Keir had previously said the hotel he was staying in wasn't serving food. In addition to Sir Keir and Miss Foy, the 43-second footage of the gathering shows a mystery blonde-haired woman, and two young male Labour aides eating what appear to be naan bread from plates.  A sixth person - a man - can briefly be seen walking along a corridor at the far end of the small kitchen in which they were meeting.  In May 2020, Mrs Foy posed for photographs with head chef Syed Islam and other staff at The Capital as they displayed a banner highlighting how they had supplied complementary meals for 'NHS heroes' treating Covid patients at University Hospital North Durham. In a glowing endorsement posted on her website, she said: 'This is another heart-warming example of how the communities and businesses in my brilliant constituency look out for one another.  'I hope all the staff who received one of Syed's incredible meals enjoyed them.  'I was lucky enough to sample one and I can confirm that his status as an award-winning chef is very much deserved. Well done to Team Capital!  Asked at 11am yesterday whether the restaurant had delivered the food seen being consumed in the video, the delivery driver recalled it being 'quite a big order' of curries, rice and naan bread. 'It was about four bags of stuff,' he said.  'There were a few people.  Probably about 30 or so.' Questioned as to whether it looked like a party, he said it had not, adding that the people present seemed 'quite spread out'.  However after saying he needed to speak to a manager, his account later changed. At 5pm he insisted he had been mistaken in his earlier comments and that other drivers had been carrying out deliveries at that time.  Shown a photograph of the Miners Hall, he insisted: 'I have never been there before.' Interviewed about the gathering on LBC radio in January, Sir Keir said: 'No restaurants were open, no pubs were open.  The hotel we were staying in had no food, they didn't run food. 'So if you didn't get a takeaway then our team wasn't eating that evening.'  Durham Police are facing mounting calls to launch a new probe into the event, having announced in February that no rules had been broken.  The students who filmed the video clip said yesterday they were willing to provide a full statement to officers. The Labour Party was approached for comment.",
  "dfada8b8be7fd6aab50491cdca931e66982a23cf6d6ce938b30ab215": "Angelina Jolie made a secret visit to an orphanage in Ukraine as part of a whistle-stop trip to the war-torn nation. The Hollywood star, 46, kept her journey under wraps, with members of her entourage reportedly signing deals banning them from revealing any details. Local officials had no knowledge of her visit to the orphanage at an undisclosed location around 90 minutes' drive from the western city of Lviv. The mother of six is a UN envoy for refugees but officials there insisted her visit was made in 'a private capacity'. Sources said Miss Jolie left the country tonight after arriving in Lviv on Saturday.  The star of Tomb Raider also visited children at a hospital and later spoke to refugees at the train station, which 1.5 million Ukrainians have travelled through fleeing to safety.  When an air raid alert sounded, Miss Jolie seemed unfazed before being ushered away. Asked if she was afraid, she replied: 'No, I don't care.'  Last night in a statement, the actress said: 'I'm humbled to witness the resilience and courage and dignity of the Ukrainian people. The impact the war is having on a generation of Ukrainian children is devastating to see.' A spokesman denied that Miss Jolie, who has three adopted children, planned to adopt another, insisting that the secrecy around the orphanage visit was for security reasons.   Reporters who tried to approach the star at the train station on Saturday were told it was a private visit. 'Angelina said her visit was not for press,' said aid volunteer Rostyslav Hetman (CORR) who posed for a selfie with Ms Jolie at the station. However, Ms Jolie did pose for dozens of selfies and travelled with her own personal photographer who supplied pictures hand-picked by the star to the media. Before giving birth to her three youngest children Shiloh, 14, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 13, who she had with actor Brad Pitt, Jolie became a mom to Maddox, 20, Pax, 18 and Zahara, 17, through adoption. Maddox and Zahara were adopted from orphanages in Cambodia and Ethiopia by Angelina. She and her ex-husband Billy Bob Thornton adopted her oldest child, Maddox Chivan in 2002. The pair took in Maddox after finding him in a Cambodian orphanage, but the adoption process took a while due to US government legislation. Three years after welcoming Maddox into her family, Angelina adopted six-month-old Ethiopian orphan Zahara Marley. Miss Jolie previously opened up about the importance of honouring her three adopted children's roots in an interview with Vogue. 'Each is a beautiful way of becoming family. What is important is to speak with openness about all of it and to share. 'Adoption' and 'orphanage' are positive words in our home,' the Oscar winner said. She went on to describe her children as 'six very brave, very strong young people.' In the same interview, the movie star spoke of ending her marriage to Brad Pitt, whom she met in 2004 on the set of the film Mr. And Mrs. Smith, for the 'well-being' of kids. The former Hollywood power couple - known as Brangelina - married in August 2014 after 10 years together.  But they split in 2016 after Mr Pitt and Maddox allegedly got into an argument on a private jet while on the way to Los Angeles. The row led to Angelina filing for divorce that year. Mr Pitt was later cleared of any wrongdoing but a judge granted Angelina physical custody of all six children.",
  "15107ad69f7b1d27ceb0f10606992ec271ebe40831266b0e05e1e328": "We often think of doctors dishing out pills willy-nilly. While sometimes there is over-prescribing, for example doctors giving out antidepressants when therapy might be more appropriate, every prescription that is written is carefully analysed and monitored. Which is what makes the current situation with anti-ageing fillers all the more bizarre. Fillers are not and have never been a prescription item in this country, so just about anyone can inject them. Think about that for a moment. While I, as a doctor, will have any antibiotic prescription I write audited and checked over by various layers of professionals, someone with little more than a few hours' training (if that) can currently inject a substance into someone's face that can dramatically alter their appearance. Furthermore, if done incorrectly, the treatment risks a host of serious side-effects, including blocking blood vessels and causing death to parts of the tissue. People just don't realise that, under current rules, an aesthetic practitioner in the UK does not need any mandatory qualifications, meaning literally anyone can inject dermal fillers. It beggars belief that this has been the case for so long. Now, however, things might be about to change. Last week MPs heard how the current laissez-faire attitude to dermal fillers put the public at risk and there were finally calls for them to be made prescription-only. At the very least, this would mean the substances used in fillers would be properly monitored and that a medical professional, such as a doctor, would have to be involved. It does seem bizarre that anyone can inject a substance into someone's face in this country without any restrictions. It's not just the fact that it has the potential for life-changing consequences if done incorrectly, but actually my biggest fear is that in this wild west of cosmetic procedures, too often it's being given to people who are inappropriately young. I was horrified the other day to see an 18-year-old-girl in A&E (who had come in with an unrelated problem) tell me that she had just had her lips 'done'. Unfortunately, she looked just like a blow-up doll. Why would anyone her age need what is supposed to be an anti-ageing injection? What she needed was careful counselling and emotional help, not some chemical pumped into her face. I'm sickened that young women are even considering this, but what is truly horrifying is the thoughtlessness of the people doing it to them. These sorts of procedures are wholly inappropriate. It's easy to blame the cult of celebrity, where a face full of fillers is seen as part of a beauty regime. Many fans look up to these famous people and want to emulate them, not realising that actually, ironically, they already have the youthful appearance these celebrities are chasing. But the buck must stop with the practitioners who are wielding the needle. By making it prescription-only, doctors would need to be involved and they are bound by strict ethical guidelines about who to administer these injections to. Doctors who prescribe in a reckless or unprofessional manner would be quickly identified and questioned. Those who are found to have breached guidelines or acted outside of the usual accepted practice would risk serious consequences. There are several layers of protection, with prescriptions monitored at a local, regional and national level. This is important because -- while medications might be intended to help -- inappropriate or incorrect prescribing can be dangerous, or even deadly. Medications are powerful things and should be treated with care and respect. Moving to a prescription model would lead to a crackdown on the cowboy practitioners by making our medical professionals responsible for dishing out the treatment. Yes, there are unscrupulous and unprofessional doctors and nurses. I know that, don't get me wrong. But the scrutiny that exists around prescribing would mean at least some monitoring and it would mean patients would be required to have a sit-down, face-to-face consultation with the prescriber who would be duty-bound to explain the risks and benefits, just as they are with any other medication or procedure. It strikes me as utterly bonkers that this industry has proliferated in the past decade without any kind of regulation in place. While dermal fillers might be able to turn back the clock, it's time that this industry was dragged into the present day. The PS2 billion-a-year NHS compensation pay-out scheme needs an overhaul, according to former health secretary Jeremy Hunt. He's right. The system is hugely costly to tax- payers and much of it is wasted on legal fees. It needs to shift from a blame culture to one where NHS trusts learns from its mistakes.  Don't treat ADHD as a fashion fad TV chef Gizzi Erskine, pictured, has slammed people who claim to have ADHD just to 'look cool'. I'm afraid this is something I've seen again and again. There's a real tendency of late to medicalise our quirks to garner sympathy. I've seen adults say they have ADHD to explain why they can't concentrate or focus at work. A whole industry has sprung up to diagnose people with ADHD when in fact often they just need to get off their phones and learn to tolerate frustration, boredom and tedium in their lives. In children, it's even sometimes used to gloss over bad parenting. ADHD is undoubtedly a complex condition, with genetics, environment and social factors playing a part. Yet too often people reach for a label to explain their behaviour rather than looking at what's really causing it. Doctors have been told not to use 'belittling' words such as 'send home' or 'take a test'. The authors of the article, published in the BMJ, argue it portrays patients as being passive. Hang on, the world's gone mad! I'm not sure any of these phrases are particularly belittling. Sending someone home suggests that the doctor has made a decision that I don't need to be in hospital. I'm very happy for them to 'send' me home. What patients don't want is doctors pussy-footing around with the words they use. They want to be seen by a doctor who is kind and knowledgeable. Dr Max prescribes... A cup of tea  According to research, a nice cuppa is just what the doctor ordered. It showed tea is the 'optimal beverage' for good health -- cutting the risk of cancer, heart disease and dementia. This is because it's rich in compounds such as flavonoids and L-theanine which have antioxidant properties, suppress inflammation and boost tissue repair. So put the kettle on!",
  "d5cb44b490478f1972118e65f9a478869938a7892d287e96e152da1c": "Keir Starmer was told tonight to provide evidence to back up his claims over Beergate.  The Labour leader says he did not break Covid rules when he was caught on camera swigging beer with colleagues last year.  He insists he was working and he and his team had only stopped for a 'break' and food before resuming their duties at Durham Miners Hall.  But Tory MPs said it stretched credulity to suggest Sir Keir had carried on working so late when the footage of him drinking beer had been shot at 10.04pm on a Friday night.  Labour refused to provide any evidence that he really went back to work, saying only that it had nothing to add on the matter.  In a further twist, a delivery driver for an Indian restaurant yesterday claimed that he had dropped off 'quite a big order' at the hall of 'about four bags' of curry, rice and naan bread.  He also estimated there were 'probably about 30 or so' people there.  But after the Mail made further enquires with the restaurant, he changed his story to say he had no recollection of making the delivery on April 30.  Scott Benton, Tory MP for Blackpool South, said: 'Labour must provide proof that Keir returned to work after his beers at 10pm if they expect people to believe this claim. Why would they not provide evidence for this claim if it is true?'  Brendan Clarke-Smith, Conservative MP for Bassetlaw, said: 'Sir Keir must provide evidence to back up this claim if it is to be believed. Labour already has admitted they lied about Angela Rayner's presence. Is there anything else they haven't told us?'  Michael Fabricant, who represents Lichfield for the Conservatives, said: 'Having first denied that Angela Rayner was present then having to admit that she was, Keir Starmer needs even more to provide some evidence that he did indeed go back to work. It is, after all, pretty unbelievable.'  Sir Keir was today forced to admit Labour had not told the truth over the Durham gathering.  The party had initially claimed that Mrs Rayner, the deputy leader, had not been present, but last week it confirmed she was after being presented with video evidence by the Daily Mail.  Appearing on Sky News yesterday, Sir Keir said: 'It is a genuine mistake and I take responsibility for it.'  The Tories yesterday stepped up their calls for Durham Constabulary to investigate whether Sir Keir was in breach of Covid regulations.  In February the force decided not to launch a formal probe after reviewing a video of the event and deciding it did not believe an offence had been 'established'.  Richard Holden, the Tory MP for North West Durham, wrote to the force a week ago asking them to reconsider in light of Scotland Yard's decision to fine the Prime Minister over a breach in Downing Street.  Last night he sent a further letter asking officers to look into Sir Keir's 'implausible' account.  Mr Holden wrote: 'Keir Starmer has again repeated his claim that he returned to work after being pictured drinking beer inside after 10pm on the evening in question.  'As many observers - including residents of County Durham - now know, this seems implausible.' He added that it 'simply cannot be the case that Keir Starmer returned to work', or that the drink was 'reasonably necessary for work purposes'.  Mr Holden also demanded that police interview two students who filmed the video of Sir Keir swigging beer. The pair told the Mail on Sunday yesterday that Sir Keir, local Labour MP Mary Foy and a mystery woman, who may have been Mrs Rayner, were gathered in a narrow kitchen next to Mrs Foy's office.  The witnesses, who are university students, said the trio and other Labour officials, who were standing in a narrow corridor outside, appeared to be socialising.  'I have never seen a work meeting with people sitting on tables, drinking San Miguel and standing around eating off plates,' one said.  'They weren't having a meeting. There is a clear difference between a meeting and what was happening there, which was entirely social.'  Sir Keir drank his now-infamous beer with Labour comrades when England was only slowly emerging from lockdown and strict laws remained against indoor socialising.  He was in the North East to campaign for candidates ahead of a crucial 'Red Wall' by-election as well as council and crime tsar polls.  Under the 'Step 2' restrictions in place between April 12 and May 17, the Government insisted: 'You must not socialise indoors except with your household or support bubble.'  Outdoor groups were limited to just six people. When the photo emerged in January, Sir Keir said: 'I was in a constituency office just days before the election. We were very busy, we were working in the office and we stopped for something to eat. And then we carried on working. That is the long and the short of it.  'No party, no breach of the rules and absolutely no comparison with the Prime Minister... We'd stopped to eat a takeaway whilst we were working in the office and then we carried on. Just to put it in context this was about a few days before the May elections.  Labour tonight declined to provide proof the party leader continued working. A spokesman said: 'No rules were broken.'

  "84e246772dcdf4c2c2604ff7d87dc3146a696a76a172e50b90ad39bb": "A simple blood test has the potential to revolutionise how doctors detect early on if cancer may be returning, British scientists have found. They discovered the test, known as a liquid biopsy, can accurately predict if cancer caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) is going to come back. Most people get some type of HPV, passed on via sexual contact, in their life although many clear the infection without ever knowing they had it. But some rare types increase the risk of certain cancers, including those affecting the head and neck, the cervix, anus and genitals. Currently, doctors have to take a tissue sample to try to work out if the disease may return after treatment. This is time-consuming and distressing for patients, and in some cases does not give conclusive results, which can lead to further surgery. But a study at the University of Edinburgh reveals the 'huge potential' of a much simpler test. Researchers used the liquid biopsy, which has similar methods to PCR testing for Covid, to assess how 104 patients with throat cancer responded to combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The test detected tiny fragments of DNA in the blood which are derived from HPV residing in the tumour. If the HPV virus is still present in cancer patients, the test can also estimate how many copies there are, which indicates how well the tumour is responding to treatment. Results revealed that, in 95 per cent of cases, the liquid biopsy results matched those from standard tissue sample tests. Professor Tim Aitman, of Edinburgh University and co-lead study author, said: 'By picking up on DNA from tumours before symptoms appear, liquid biopsy has huge potential to revolutionise how we detect cancer at an early stage. We have shown it can work for throat cancer patients but the beauty of the technology is we can adapt it to detect any DNA sequence that is linked to cancer from a simple blood test.' Twelve weeks after the patients had chemotherapy, the liquid biopsy picked up 92 per cent of those who had no HPV DNA in their blood, confirming the treatment had worked. In contrast, 75 per cent of patients tested with existing techniques had confirmation that chemotherapy was successful. This, the researchers say, suggests the new test could detect if a treatment has worked more accurately than standard methods. Co-lead study author Iain Nixon said liquid biopsy 'can reduce some of the distress and anxiety people feel about their treatment whilst giving doctors a reliable tool to help give patients the best possible care'. The trial was reported in the European Journal of Surgical Oncology.",

Two other people, whose details have not yet been confirmed, have also been taken to hospitals in south and west London, police have confirmed. Emergency services were called at 1.35pm today to a multi-vehicle collision which led to the eastbound carriageway being shut. Motorists faced severe delays in London between junctions 4 and 3 near Heathrow Airport.  National Highways traffic officers arrived at the scene and the westbound route was blocked to allow the air ambulance to land. A London Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'We were called at 1.35pm today (Sunday) to reports of a road traffic collision on the M4. 'We sent a number of resources including three ambulances, a medic in a fast response car, and an incident response officer. 'Our crews treated patients at the scene, and took three people to hospital.' A spokesman for the Met Police said: 'At 1.43pm police were called following a road traffic collision involving four vehicles close to junction three of the M4 in West Drayton. 'Officers attended with the London Ambulance Service and the London Fire Brigade. The London Air Ambulance landed at the scene. 'A 10-year-old girl who was travelling in one of the cars has been transported by air to a south London hospital with injuries that are believed to be life threatening.  'The M4 was closed in both directions to allow the emergency services to respond to the incident. The eastbound side is likely to remain closed for some time with significant traffic delays expected as a result.' Stranded motorists were pictured stood outside their vehicles as the motorway has been closed in both directions following a 'multi-vehicle collision'. Highways England warned of hour-long delays as diversions were put in place around the busy airport. A statement says: 'There are severe delays of 60 minutes on The M4 eastbound in Greater London between J4 and J3 (near Heathrow Airport) due to a multi vehicle collision which has resulted in the eastbound carriageway being closed.  'Emergency services are in attendance including National Highways Traffic Officers. 'At present westbound is also blocked to allow the air ambulance to land and currently has delays of 30 minutes.' It also warns road users to use a diversion route that has been put in place and to 're-route or even delay your journey'.  The incident has also caused delays to stretch back onto the M25 for those travelling eastbound. Pictures from the scene show at least four ambulances in attendance, along with firefighters, police and Highways England officers.   The Highways England diversion route says: 'Road users are advised to follow the solid circle diversion symbol on road signs. 'Exit the M4 at J4 and take the third exit onto the M4 Heathrow Spur road. At the roundabout take the first exit onto the A4 slip road and join the A4 Bath Road.

Now Norland College, which trains the elite nannies to care for children of the rich and famous, has made a concession to modern sensibilities by introducing a gender-neutral option to its strict dress code.  While female pupils had been expected to wear a dress and male pupils trousers, all students can now opt for trousers, along with the traditional tweed blazer or raincoat. Even male nannies are a relatively new innovation for the college, with its first graduates in 2018. Principal Dr Janet Rose said: 'As our student body has become increasingly diverse, we have adapted the uniform to be more inclusive with a new gender- neutral option. 'I remain dedicated to ensuring Norland is an inclusive environment, open to all.' Students are expected to wear the uniform throughout their three-year childcare course in Bath, which also includes lessons in self-defence, security training, evasive driving and - a must for celebrity clients - paparazzi avoidance skills. While in the uniform, students must not chew gum, listen to music through headphones, buy fast food or alcohol or use a phone while walking. Many continue to wear their uniform when they start working, either by personal choice or at the insistence of their employer, keen to show off the kudos of having a Norland nanny - which can cost them up to PS100,000 a year.  Despite the high salaries, Dr Rose said demand for Norland nannies is higher than ever, with 14 jobs available for each one who qualifies. Those who have graduated from the college include Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo, who has been nanny for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge since 2014, and Ulrika Jonsson's daughter, Bo, who qualified last week.",

Russia's military leaders are pouring troops and equipment into the east of Ukraine in an attempt to force a bloody victory there after they abandoned plans to blitz through Ukraine's north and seize Kyiv earlier in the war. The town of Lyman, located a mere 15 miles from the Donetsk region's northernmost city of Slovyansk and 30 miles from the city of Izyum in the Kharkiv region, was the site of five of the civilian deaths. 'On May 1, four civilians were killed in Russian shelling in the Donetsk region, all in Lyman. Eleven other people were injured,' governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Telegram, later adding another person died of his injuries. Ukrainian media organisation Ukraine Now reported the attacks came as part of a consolidated Russian shelling offensive targeting Ukrainian military positions along the eastern front in Lyman, Severodonetsk, Slovyansk, Popasna and Kurakhiv over the weekend. Another three people were killed in shelling on residential areas in and around Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city, the regional governor Oleg Synegubov said on Telegram. 'As a result of these shellings, unfortunately, three people were killed and eight civilians were injured.' The Ukrainian army has also withdrawn from Kharkiv, its troops now in outlying positions, according to AFP journalists who recently visited the city. President Volodymyr Zelensky recently acknowledged that the situation was 'difficult' in Donbas, the eastern Ukrainian mining basin that has become the priority target of Russian troops, who invaded Ukraine on 24 February. Both Russia and Ukraine are thought to have sustained heavy losses in the WWI-style fighting along the eastern front, which sees rounds of bloody ground fighting punctuated by artillery strikes as Putin's troops attempt to gain territory inch-by-inch. Valery Gerasimov, the chief of staff of the Russian army, was today wounded in Izyum, just 30 miles from Lyman in a Ukrainian artillery strike. An unofficial Russian source reported that Gerasimov sustained 'a shrapnel wound in the upper third of the right leg without a bone fracture. 'The shard was removed - there is no danger to life,' he said. But Gerasimov's injury was severe enough to have him flown away from the frontlines and back to Russia to undergo further treatment, marking another embarrassing defeat for Putin's forces. The chief of staff's injury came just one day after Russian Major General Andrei Simonov, 55, was killed in Kharkiv, according to an adviser to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky.  He is Russia's ninth general to have been killed since the start of the invasion. Elsewhere in the Donbas region, around 100 civilians were evacuated from the besieged Azovstal steel plant in the decimated city of Mariupol - though up to 1,000 civilians remain trapped in the port's last remaining Ukrainian holdout. It comes as a UN 'safe passage operation' began yesterday, when officials reached the site in the decimated coastal metropolis. The city is under almost total Russian control but some Ukrainian fighters and around 1,000 civilians are thought to be holed up in the steel works -- a vast Soviet-era plant founded under Josef Stalin and designed with a labyrinth of bunkers and tunnels to withstand attack.  Zelensky said this afternoon that a group of about 100 people were being evacuated from the steelworks and are to be taken to Ukrainian-controlled territory in Zaporizhzhia. 'Tomorrow we'll meet them in Zaporizhzhia. Grateful to our team,' he tweeted.  'Now they, together with #UN, are working on the evacuation of other civilians from the plant.'  With fighting stretching along a broad front in southern and eastern Ukraine, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi pledged continued American support for Ukraine when she met Zelensky in an unannounced visit to Kyiv yesterday. Footage posted by Zelensky on Twitter on Sunday showed him, flanked by an armed escort and dressed in military fatigues, greeting a U.S. Congressional delegation led by Pelosi outside his presidential office the previous day. 'Our delegation travelled to Kyiv to send an unmistakable and resounding message to the entire world: America stands firmly with Ukraine,' Pelosi, the highest ranking U.S. official to visit Ukraine since Russia invaded on Feb. 24, said in a statement. Zelensky praised as substantive four hours of talks with Pelosi focused on U.S. weapons deliveries. 'We are grateful to all our partners who send Russia important and powerful signals of support for Ukraine by visiting our capital at such a difficult time,' he said.   Speaking from Poland today following her visit to Kyiv, Pelosi urged Ukraine not to back down in the face of 'bullies'. 'Do not be bullied by bullies. If they are making threats, you cannot back down. That's my view of it,' she told a news conference in the Polish city of Rzeszow. 'We are here for the fight and you cannot fold to a bully,' Pelosi said.",
  "843885bc7117460c306bff5e0718a457143b2a3d833cb79956dad415": "Police forces have been urged to 'decolonise' their training material in a bid to attract new recruits.  The College of Policing, which sets guidance for the training of police officers, issued the call in a jargon-filled equality manifesto sent to forces nationwide.  It wants trainers to 'review curriculums to ensure 'decolonisation' of learning content' and check that teaching methods 'implement culturally sustaining pedagogy'.  The guidance is the latest move in a controversial drive by educational institutions to make lessons more diverse, with race campaigners urging them to be more conscious of ethnic minority experiences.  Forces and universities offering professional policing courses are also being advised to 'consider introducing gender neutral facilities' to take account of 'gender reassignment' candidates.  The College of Policing document encourages forces to become a 'Stonewall Champion' - an organisation endorsed by the LGBT campaign group for meeting its workplace equality criteria.  But many Government departments that paid to be part of Stonewall's scheme have pulled out of the programme amid criticism of the lobby group's extreme stance on transgender rights.  In the College guidance, training staff are also warned that 'not giving individuals the time to reflect on unconscious bias programmes' - which claims to look at people's underlying prejudices - 'may lead to unconscious bias'.  Harry Miller, a former police officer and founder of the Fair Cop campaign group, said: 'This is further evidence that the police only have an interest in being woke and very little interest in addressing the matters that concern the public.'  The new training plan was designed as the Government continues its drive for 20,000 extra officers.  Last week it was announced that more than 13,500 officers had been recruited, 42 per cent of them women and 12 per cent from ethnic minorities.  But police leaders have warned of an alarming dropout rate because many new officers are unprepared for the reality of frontline policing.  In March, the Police Federation said some trainees were too scared to speak to the public, ran away from violence and even got their parents to ask for their birthday off.  A College of Policing spokesman said: 'Equality impact assessments fulfil a legal requirement under the Equality Act 2010. As part of fulfilling that legal requirement, this technical document shares existing research that forces may wish to consider to help them attract and develop effective officers.  'It is for each force to decide whether specific elements of this research would be of benefit.'",
  "24f1be529db72ddc8715cdca3919cf29b67e3106c2d667ad6b5e5232": "Council chiefs have advised staff to omit the word 'family' when sending Christmas greetings so as not to offend those who have no relatives. Details released under Freedom of Information legislation also details how employees at the Royal Borough of Greenwich in London are being urged to avoid referring to 'the young' or 'youngsters' in favour of 'young persons or young adults', and not to describe those who are pregnant as either women or expectant mothers. The suggestions feature in an inclusivity guide, Language Matters, produced by the Labour-run authority. One section of the 42-page document advises workers to steer clear of linking specific attributes to chronological age' and rather than use phrases like 'a young and vibrant team', should consider 'a team made up of people in the early stage of their careers'. No mention of family should be made in Christmas greetings, the guide suggests, because 'not everyone spends these celebrations with their biological family or with anyone at all'. A phrase such as 'Sending our best wishes to you and your family this Christmas time' should be replaced by 'Sending you our best wishes this Christmas time, however you're spending it'. It recommends avoiding phrases such as 'women who are pregnant' and 'expectant mothers' and to instead use gender-neutral phrases like 'people who are pregnant' and 'expectant parents'.  By way of elaboration, the guide also states: 'Not everyone who is pregnant is a woman - people who are non-binary or trans men can also be pregnant.' Referring to the pregnancy guidance, Helen Joyce, of the campaign group Sex Matters, said: 'I don't think this guidance is misogynistic by intent, but its effects could be. 'The language is for the sake of accommodating what is a tiny number of people in this country.  'For the sake of accommodating them, you are making invisible the fundamental differences between men and women.' Greenwich council said: 'Our inclusive language guide is advisory only and was designed to encourage staff to reflect on the use of language in the workplace and how it might impact their colleagues.'",
  "9839c3590a06199fb694a6b733fd561c1319693b1fac3a7b69f111f4": "Netflix has dropped Meghan Markle's animated series as part of a wave of cutbacks prompted by the streaming service's drop in subscribers. Pearl, the working title for the Markle-created show, has been officially canceled, Deadline reported Sunday.  The show, which was created by the Duchess of Sussex through Archewell Productions, was still only in the development stage. Markle and Prince Harry established Archewell Productions in autumn 2020 in an effort to create scripted series, docuseries, documentaries, features and children's programming. Pearl was expected to be the first animated series created by the production company. Despite dropping Pearl, insiders claim Netflix remains optimistic about the Archewell deal and has a number of projects planned, including a documentary series called Heart of Invictus, which follows the recent Invictus Games. Netflix has made several cuts in recent days, including dropping two other children's shows and firing staff. Last week, the streaming service scratched Dino Daycare, which was created by Jeff King, and the South Asian-inspired adventure Boons and Curses. Both shows were already in production. Sources familiar with the cancellations told Deadline that Netflix had warned producers to take projects still in the development stage elsewhere. It is unclear if they offered Archewell Productions similar advice.  The streaming giant shelled out a $100million in the deal with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in September 2020. As of yet, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are yet to produce any published content for the streaming giant. But the company has pinned hopes that their upcoming series documenting the recent Invictus Games will prove value for the money. Markle announced the now-canceled program last July. She was taking on the roles of 'creator and executive producer' - marking the first time the former actress and Suits star would work in the position of EP. Filmmaker David Furnish, husband to musician Elton John, was also expected to serve as an executive producer on the series. Markle said Pearl would 'weave together fantasy and history' while focusing 'on the adventures of a 12-year-old girl' as she attempts to 'overcome life's daily challenges'.  While few details had been released about the series, many believed the show was based - at least in part - on Markle's own childhood, citing how she named the show and its title character Pearl, the origin meaning of her name. The name Meghan originated in Wales, where it is traditionally spelled Megan, however, it originally came from the Greek name Margaret, derived from the word margarites, which translates to 'pearl'. Pearl was not the first time that Markle has seemingly chosen to draw on her own life as the inspiration for her professional projects - something that she did most recently with her debut children's book The Bench, which was firmly panned by readers on both sides of the Atlantic. Netflix also began firing staff after missing its subscriber target by 200,000 people and watching the value of its shares tank by 50 percent in a month. The company made the layoffs at Tudum, a website filled with stories that are meant to market Netflix's programs, it was revealed on Thursday. At least 10-15 staff tweeted about being fired, although the exact number dismissed remains unclear.   The site, named as an onomatopoeia for the sound you hear when a Netflix show begins, was meant to allow subscribers insider access to the company's shows.    Netflix refused to tell the Los Angeles Times how many jobs were cut, merely saying  'our fan website Tudum is an important priority for the company.'  Some of those laid off took to Twitter, saying that the company had only hired them months earlier.  There have been several hypotheses for why the streamer is losing eyeballs, with many including Tesla CEO (and potential future Twitter chief) Elon Musk blaming 'the woke mind virus.'  Responding to a tweet about the subscription service's devastating performance, Musk said: 'The woke mind virus is making Netflix unwatchable.' A follower then responded: 'Woke mind virus is the biggest threat to the civilization.' The world's richest man replied to him: 'Yes.'  Fans applauded Musk's comments with some even urging him to take over Netflix after he concludes his Twitter deal.  Others, however, have suggested that the real problem is Netflix's habit of canceling beloved shows before their time, angering fans.  Popular TV dramas like The OA, Marco Polo, and The Punisher are being cancelled by the service after series two - leaving fans furious and threatening to cancel their subscriptions because they no longer want to 'invest their time in a series' over fears it will be 'culled'.  Meanwhile, over half of Netflix's own reality TV shows and dramas released in 2018 have not been commissioned for a second series, compared with more than a third launched in 2017 and 28 percent in 2016, The Times reported. It comes as the streaming behemoth has lost 200,000 subscribers in just three months, while shareholders of the US firm have been warned to expect another two million subscribers to leave in the three months to July. Bosses say a second price-rise in a year has played a part, while the company has lost 700,000 following its decision to pull out of Russia in the wake of Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Netflix said the Covid boom had 'created a lot of noise' and blamed the slowdown on the return to normality after two years of lockdowns. It also blamed password sharing for the rise in cancelled accounts, as it estimated that about 10million households worldwide are watching its service for free by using the account of a friend or another family member. The company has now started testing different ways of curbing password sharing in Chile, Costa Rica and Peru - and could extend this elsewhere if it proves successful. Bosses are also considering turning the service into a low-fee subscription supported by ads. Netflix also claimed that the market had now been 'saturated' by rising competition from streaming services including Disney+, Apple TV, Now TV, Warner Bros Discovery and Paramount, the cost-of-living crisis gripping the US, Canada and Western Europe, and its decision to quit streaming in Russia after Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine in February. The rapid rise of rival Disney+, which has seen billions of dollars of investment in recent years, has seen competition in the streaming market increase dramatically. And other services like Amazon Prime Video, which has captured a share of the live football market in the UK, and AppleTV+, which has seen success through football comedy Ted Lasso, have also seen people turn away from Netflix.  Despite the streaming service's recent issues, there have been some successes, with dystopian Korean series Squid Game proving a huge hit, and season one of period drama Bridgerton taking the world by storm.  However, fan favorites such as Bloodline and Jessica Jones were cancelled after their third season, leaving viewers frustrated and 'tired of starting something new only for it to be cancelled two years later'.",
  "be8408920decb2aea83fc01171ced203032f3ec05834ed85435b28ec": "Shocking new images have revealed the extent of the carnage in the city of Mariupol which has endured two months of constant bombardment amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  The southern port city, which Putin sees as a key strategic position in the eastern Donbas region on the Sea of Azov, has been under siege for more than eight weeks as Russian forces have conducted round the clock bombing raids and indiscriminate missile strikes on military, administrative and civilian targets alike. Now with the war well into its ninth week, the once vibrant coastal metropolis with a pre-war population of around 450,000 has been largely reduced to rubble amid Putin's wrath, and not a single row of houses appears to have survived the onslaught without sustaining at least some damage. More than 90 percent of the city's infrastructure has been severely damaged, while 45 per cent of it has been completely destroyed according to mayor Vadym Boychenko. There are now just 100,000 people living among the bombed out ruins. More than three quarters of the pre-war population have fled and tens of thousands are believed to have died according to Ukrainian authorities. Satellite images released yesterday of the city centre by Maxar Technologies reveal the true scale of the destruction. Entire blocks have been completely decimated, while the Donetsk regional theatre, which once provided shelter to around 400 Ukrainian civilians until it was targeted in a direct strike by Russian missiles, can be seen totally caved in. Other images showed rows of what appear to be freshly dug mass graves along a cemetery on the edge of the city, as well as the dilapidated exterior of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol's harbour. The factory remains the only part of the city not under total Russian control and its network of underground rooms and tunnels constitute the final stronghold of a small contingent of Ukrainian fighters, along with roughly 1,000 civilians sheltering from Putin's bombs.   Russia continued its brutal bombardment of Mariupol yesterday, even as a small battalion of Ukrainian fighters attempted to evacuate a small group of desperate civilians from the Azovstal steel plant. Putin's forces now control the overwhelming majority of the city and are mostly focusing their airstrikes on the Soviet-era steel plant located close to the harbour, where a contingent of between 1,000-2000 Ukrainian soldiers are staging a desperate holdout alongside roughly 1,000 civilians. Commanders of the soldiers hiding in the network of tunnels and rooms underneath the plant have repeatedly called for international aid and a safe passage for evacuation, saying the plant's residents are barely surviving on extremely limited food and water and that there are many injured soldiers and civilians suffering without proper medical attention.  U.N. humanitarian spokesman Saviano Abreu yesterday said the world organization was negotiating with authorities in Moscow and Kyiv to organise a ceasefire. 'There is, right now, ongoing, high-level engagements with all the governments, Russia and Ukraine, to make sure that you can save civilians and support the evacuation of civilians from the plant,' Abreu said. But the spokesman could not provide details of the ongoing evacuation effort 'because of the complexity and fluidity of the operation.' A nine-year-old girl has miraculously survived a Russian cluster bomb attack that left shrapnel lodged in her brain. Sofia Hurmasa even summoned the strength to speak from her hospital bed: 'Now, my dream is for the war to be over.' Her ability to speak at all has astonished doctors after the blast in the southern city of Mykolaiv left Sofia in a coma. Shrapnel from a banned cluster bomb shattered her skull, with one piece ripping through her forehead and passing through her brain. She underwent surgery in Mykolaiv before being brought to Lviv where medics are planning a seven-hour procedure to remove the fragment. Her mother Nina, 48, recalled how just two months ago, Sofia was posting TikTok videos of herself dancing and singing. Now she can barely walk and struggles to compose her thoughts. Nina and Sofia were caught in a Russian bombardment as they walked to a restaurant to buy some soup. Nina saw her daughter's favourite beanie hat had turned crimson red. 'Sofia lost consciousness. In that moment I thought I was losing her,' she said. Gazing lovingly at Sofia in her hospital bed, Nina seethes at Putin. 'This man has no heart. I cannot even say his name. How can he do this to our children? Ukrainian authorities have time and again attempted to evacuate civilians from the worst-hit areas in Mariupol via 'humanitarian corridors', during a pre-agreed period lasting typically a few hours in which both sides agreed not to launch any strikes. But officials say Russia habitually breaks the ceasefire and conducts attacks on the corridors, killing civilians and bringing the rescue operations to an early end each time evacuations get underway. The ferocity of the fighting, and the plight of the civilians hiding in the Azovstal factory, has stunned the world, bringing Pentagon press secretary John Kirby to the verge of tears on Friday. 'It's hard to look at what [Putin] is doing in Ukraine, what his forces are doing in Ukraine, and think that any ethical, moral individual could justify that,' Kirby, a retired rear admiral, told reporters.  'It's difficult to look at some of the images and imagine that any well-thinking, serious, mature leader would do that. So, I can't talk to his psychology. But I think we can all speak to his depravity.' A vast underground network of tunnels and bunkers has provided civilians and fighters hiding in the steel plant with relative safety from airstrikes.  But the situation has grown more dire in recent days after the Russians dropped 'bunker busters' and other bombs on the plant, mayor Boychenko said Friday. Women whose husbands are trapped in the plant with the Azov Regiment said they feared soldiers will be tortured and killed if they are left behind and captured. Yesterday, a commander of the Azov battalion trapped in the steel factory said some civilians were successfully evacuated from the plant after a planned ceasefire for 6am local time eventually got underway at 11am. Captain Svyatoslav Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov Regiment, said 20 civilians were evacuated and are now on their way Ukrainian-controlled territory in Zaporizhzhia, after a 12-hour wait.  'Since 6am we've been waiting for the evacuation convoy to arrive, which only arrived at 6:25pm,' Palamar said in a video statement released online. 'We have brought 20 civilians to the agreed meeting point, whom we've managed to rescue from under the rubble. These are women and children. We hope these people will go the agreed destination, which is Zaporizhzhia, the territory controlled by Ukraine.' Palamar continued: 'As of now, the rescue operation is ongoing, conducted by the servicemen of Azov - we rescue the civilians from under the rubble. 'These are women, children and the elderly,' he repeated, before imploring Russian troops to respect further ceasefire arrangements. 'We hope that this process will be further extended and we will successfully evacuate all civilians,' he said.",
  "158ae0b07b53654f506984616984a48bc318284b03eef69d5993dcaa": "A fire has broken out at a Russian defence ministry facility near to the border with Ukraine following a reported explosion, injuring one person according to a regional governor. A huge explosion in the area of Streletskoe and Tomarovka was reported by Russian media earlier today, video footage shows plumes of smoke and fire bellowing from a building believed to be near to Belgorod. It is currently unclear what caused the fire, and there has been no official comment from the Russian defence ministry yet. It is thought it is an weapons depot that has caught fire, as there have been secondary explosions heard - possibly of ammunition exploding in the heat of the fire. Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said only one resident suffered minor injuries but his his life was not in danger and that seven homes had been damaged.  He said: 'A fire has occurred on the territory of one of the objects belonging to the MoD. 'All operational services are working at the site and all essential measures are being taken to ensure safety.' Last month Russia accused Ukraine of a helicopter attack on a fuel depot in Belgorod, for which Kyiv denied responsibility. They have also accused Ukrainian forces of shelling villages and firing missiles at an ammunition depot. Other Russian regions that share a border with Ukraine have also reported cross-border shelling incidents since Moscow sent thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a 'special military operation'. In the Russian city of Bryansk, less than 100 miles from the Ukraine border, two large fires broke out at two oil depot last week. It was reported that the first fire occurred at a civilian facility that held 10,000 tons of fuel, while the second fire was at a military fuel depot holding 5,000 tons.",
  "cbecdd217f440a4b8bf5e633e68b5d08452801ceaf1f42e828416aef": "Afghanistan's supreme leader today appeared publicly for only the second time in six years, telling worshippers celebrating Eid al-Fitr that the Taliban had won 'victory, freedom and success' since taking power last year. Speaking just two days after a bomb ripped through a mosque in Kabul, an atmosphere of heightened security surrounded the man introduced as Hibatullah Akhundzada, the chief of the Taliban. 'Congratulations on victory, freedom and success,' he told thousands of worshippers at the Eidgah mosque in the southern city of Kandahar, the hardline Islamist group's de facto power centre. 'Congratulations on this security and for the Islamic system.' While the number of bombings across the country has dropped since Kabul fell to the Taliban last August, attacks soared over the final two weeks of the fasting month of Ramadan, which ended Saturday for Afghans. Dozens of civilians have been killed in the primarily sectarian attacks - some claimed by the Islamic State group - targeting members of the Shiite and Sufi Muslim communities.  Friday's bombing of a Sunni mosque in the capital meanwhile killed at least 10 people. Akhundzada delivered his brief address from one of the front rows of worshippers in Kandahar without turning to face the crowd, according to social media posts. Taliban officials did not allow journalists to approach him, while two helicopters hovered over the mosque for the whole of the two-hour event. Dozens of Taliban fighters were deployed where Akhundzada and other Taliban leaders were sitting and they stopped worshippers from taking their pictures on cellphones. An AFP correspondent who reported from the mosque confirmed that the voice said to be Akhundzada's came from the front rows of worshippers.  It was the reclusive figure's second known public appearance since taking control of the Taliban in 2016. When the man introduced as the Taliban leader began to speak, worshippers chanted 'Allahu Akbar! Long live Islamic Emirate and Long Live Akhundzada!' Worshipper Aziz Ahmad Ahmadi said he was overwhelmed. 'I cried when I heard the voice of Sheikh Saheb (Akhundzada)... to hear him is like achieving my biggest dream,' he said, but added he had failed to spot the leader among the crowd. Another Kandahar resident Bismillah, who attended the Eid prayers at the Eidgah mosque, said, 'I'm so happy that I can't even describe it'. 'I had a dream to pray alongside my supreme leader, to hear his voice or to see him,' he told AFP. Akhundzada's low profile has fed speculation about his role in the new Taliban government, formed after the group took control of Kabul on August 15 - and even rumours of his death. His public profile has largely been limited to the release of messages during Islamic holidays from his office in Kandahar. In October, Akhundzada visited the Darul Uloom Hakimiah mosque in the southern city, according to an audio recording circulated by Taliban social media accounts.  On Friday, in a message released ahead of Eid al-Fitr, he made no mention of the bloodshed that had rocked Afghanistan over Ramadan, instead praising the Taliban's building of 'a strong Islamic and national army' and 'strong intelligence organisation'. In Kabul, Prime Minister Mohammad Hassan Akhund held Eid prayers at the palace, where he slammed Washington for intervening in Afghanistan's internal affairs. 'Didn't they (Washington) withhold the wealth of this country which was in its bank? Isn't that intervention in this country?' Akhund said in a statement released by the authorities. Washington seized billions of dollars of Afghanistan's assets after it withdrew in August, deepening a humanitarian crisis in the country. Many Afghans in Kabul preferred to stay indoors on Sunday rather than pray at mosques after the recent deadly attacks. 'The situation of our people is very sad, especially after what happened in the mosques,' Kabul resident Ahmad Shah Hashemi told AFP. 'Many young and old people have been martyred. The people of Afghanistan have nothing but sorrow.' The deadliest attack during Ramadan was in the northern province of Kunduz, where a bomb ripped through a mosque as a group of Sufis performed rituals. At least 36 people were killed and scores more were wounded. No group has so far claimed that attack.",
  "b957e48c985d66a9acbb93e8870471002ef488e248bea3f7589b2280": "Prince Andrew was spotted leaving his granddaughter Sienna's 'private christening' in his PS220,000 Bentley with a personalised DOY plate on Friday. The Duke of York, 62, is understood to have travelled from Windsor to St James's Palace's Chapel Royal in London, for Princess Beatrice and her husband Edo Mapelli Mozzi's seven-month-old daughter's ceremony.  However, Her Majesty, 96, was thought to be absent from the ceremony as she held two virtual audiences from Windsor Castle. Andrew, who was reportedly joined at the service by his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson, 62, drove his racing-green 200mph Bentley Flying Spur from Windsor to London. It comes after the Queen's disgraced son was stripped of his Freedom of York by councillors in the city on Wednesday evening, amid further calls for him to have his dukedom removed.  The luxury motor, which was blue when first delivered in September 2020, replaced Andrew's previous Bentley Continental GT, in the same driving-green colour. Depending on the year it was first purchased, the old motor could have been sold for upwards of PS130,000 second hand. It is unclear what happens to cars belonging to members of the Firm when the owner is ready to sell. In 2019, a Mulsanne owned and used by the Queen was returned to Bentley, where features such as police lights and security communication devices were removed, and the registration number changed before being sold by a private dealership. Andrew missed the birth of Sienna in September because he was staying put in Balmoral, while the lawyers for American accuser Virginia Giuffre tried to serve him with legal papers in person.  The sighting of Prince Andrew comes after he helped the Queen to her seat during an emotional service of Thanksgiving for the Duke of Edinburgh on March 29 at Westminster Abbey.  The Duke of York has made himself scarce since he agreed to pay Virginia Giuffre an estimated PS7million to settle her sexual abuse lawsuit against him without accepting liability. Meanwhile, it has been reported that the Queen won't strip her son of the title that she gave him over 30 years ago in 1986, royal sources have claimed. It came after councillors voted to strip the Duke of York of his freedom of that city and called for him to have his dukedom removed. The prince was branded 'an utter disgrace' during the extraordinary meeting to debate his Freedom of the City honour, which was awarded to him in 1987.  After discussing the motion for around half an hour, councillors unanimously voted to strip him of the title. His continued clinging to the title Duke of York was described as as 'stain' on the city and councillors are now calling on the Queen, Palace or government to step in and strip him of the title if he refuses 'to do the right thing' and resign. The council also noted objections from the public calling for the prince to be banned from attending horse racing events in the city. Another said he should be referred to as 'Andrew Windsor' in the future. A source told the Mirror: 'The Queen certainly will not take any further action in that regard. 'The Duke of York has stepped back from public life and already had a range of titles and associations removed and Her Majesty's position has not deviated from that.'  Andrew had been warned in advance that he would be losing the freedom of the city, an honour bestowed on him on February 23, 1987, as a wedding gift to Sarah Ferguson.  He is the first person ever to have the Freedom of the City removed, councillors were told. There were two formal abstentions - from the Lord Mayor and Lord Mayor elect. Lib Dem Darryl Smalley, City of York Council's executive member for culture, leisure & communities proposed the motion and said he should also now lose the Duke of York title. He said: 'The Honorary Freedom of York is the highest honour we, as a city, can bestow on those who represent the very best of York. The honour is held by many notable and accomplished people who carry it with pride and responsibly. 'Having been stripped of his military roles and royal patronages by the Queen, we believe that it is right to remove all links that Prince Andrew still has with our great city. 'I was pleased to see councillors of all parties support this motion and make it clear that it is no longer appropriate for Prince Andrew to represent York and its residents. 'The removal of this honorary title sends the right message that we as a city stand with victims of abuse. The next logical step is now for Prince Andrew to do the right thing and relinquish his Duke of York title. 'If he fails to do so, the Government and Buckingham Palace must step in to remove his title to finally end Prince Andrew's connection to York.' It follows a slew of authorities, institutions, schools and even golf clubs, which have all sought to distance themselves from the disgraced duke since he settled his civil case with Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking victim Virginia Giuffre. In the wake of the case, which was settled in February, the 62-year-old was also stripped of his military roles and royal patronages and was told he would no longer be known as 'His Royal Highness'. Both Buckingham Palace and a spokesperson for the Duke of York declined to comment. York City Council considered the motion: 'The Council resolves that, pursuant to Section 249 of the Local Government Act 1972, the City of York Council withdraws the Honorary Freeman of the City status from the Duke of York which was conferred upon him in 1987.'",
  "3472f2e560a113f7519cc0b8bb082602a57459ede48b263bf8a9ec7c": "Sir Keir Starmer accused the Tories of 'throwing mud' ahead of the local elections today as he again denied breaking lockdown rules by drinking beer with officials last year. While repeatedly lambasting Boris Johnson over the 'Partygate' scandal, Sir Keir has repeatedly insisted that no rules were broken during his trip to Durham on April 30 last year. Appearing on television today he again denied any rules were broken. He also insisted it was an 'genuine mistake' by Labour to deny his deputy Angela Rayner was present, when she was also there. Asked if the deputy leader was at the office, Sir Keir told Sky News: 'Yes. We were in the office, we were working, we paused for something to eat, there was no party, no rules were broken and that is the long and short of it. 'I know what is going on here, we have got an election on Thursday and there are just Tory MPs trying to throw mud around because they have got nothing to say on the central issue of the cost of living.' He later said Labour did not realise it had made a mistake when it said Ms Rayner was not at the Durham event last year. Sir Keir said: 'We were asked twice and I didn't even realise we had made a mistake until it came out this week. We are a busy office, we made a mistake, it is a genuine mistake and I take responsibility for it.' But two students who filmed a video of Sir Keir Starmer swigging beer with Labour officials during lockdown have accused him of breaking Covid rules. Speaking to The Mail on Sunday, they cast doubt on the Labour leader's claim that he was not in breach of the rules because he was attending a work meeting. And in comments that will heap more pressure on Durham Constabulary to investigate the incident, both said they were prepared to make detailed statements to officers about what they saw. The university students, who asked to remain anonymous, filmed a 43-second video of Sir Keir drinking a beer and chatting with colleagues just after 10pm. At the time, indoor socialising was banned and those who disobeyed the rules faced being fined by police. But his defence is now under fresh scrutiny after the Daily Mail last week forced Labour to admit that Deputy Leader Angela Rayner was at the Durham Miners Hall on the same day, having previously denied it. The MoS can today reveal that Sir Keir, local Labour MP Mary Foy and a mystery woman, who may have been Ms Rayner, were actually gathered in a narrow kitchen next to Ms Foy's office. The eyewitnesses said the trio and other Labour officials, who were standing in a narrow corridor outside, appeared to be socialising. 'I have never seen a work meeting with people sitting on tables, drinking San Miguel and standing around eating off plates,' one said. 'They weren't having a meeting. There is a clear difference between a meeting and what was happening there, which was entirely social.' After watching for five minutes, the pair went back to their accommodation. They returned an hour later and saw that people were still inside the room. They could not see if Sir Keir was among them. Durham Police are facing mounting calls from Tory Ministers and MPs to launch a new probe, having announced in February that no rules had been broken. Both witnesses said they are prepared to help the police. 'We are the only two eyewitnesses that aren't trying to defend it,' one said. 'I would be so happy to talk to them and tell them the truth.' About three weeks before Sir Keir's trip to Durham, factory worker Tyler James, 20, from Chester-le-Street, Durham, was fined PS400 for also holding a balloon-releasing memorial for a friend who died in March 2021. 'It just makes you think, it's one rule for them, and one rule for us,' he said. 'I don't understand, if Boris Johnson was fined, why wasn't he?' Durham Constabulary said: 'We have since received further communications on this subject and will now consider the content of those communications and respond in due course.' Sir Keir Starmer  enlisted former prime minister Tony Blair to officially endorse his leadership today as he seeks 'gains' in Thursday's local elections. In a video to mark 25 years since Labour's historic 1997 landslide election win, Mr Blair praises praised Sir Keir's Starmer's 'strength, determination and intelligence'. He also recounted the 'huge ways and the myriad of small ways [that] Britain was changed for the better' by his administration. The endorsement is a bold move by a party in which Mr Blair remains a controversial figure.  He is hated by the hard left for the Iraq war and centrist policies that won him three terms in office.  Sir Keir today insisted that Labour had to make 'gains' in Thursday's local elections in order for them to be a success - as a new poll suggested more than half of voters preferred him to Boris Johnson.   Exclusive research by former Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft, published in today's Mail on Sunday shows that when asked to choose between a Conservative Government led by Boris Johnson and a Labour Government led by Sir Keir, 57 per cent of people backed Sir Keir, and 43 per cent backed Mr Johnson. But the 8,000-sample survey also picked up a 55 per cent approval rating for the Prime Minister's handling of the Ukrainian crisis, with just 25 per cent who disapprove. Despite the rows still raging about 'Partygate', the survey says the cost of living crisis is regarded as the most important issue facing the country, followed by the NHS, the economy, climate change and immigration. Tory chairman Oliver Dowden used an interview with the Sunday Telegraph today to echo this, claiming that voters were 'fed up' with media attention focused on the PM's law-breaking.  'The further you get from Westminster, the more people are focused on the delivery issues. There's this perception in Westminster that every door we're knocking on, parties are coming up on the doorstep. That really is not the case,' he said. Elections are taking place in some local councils in England, Wales and Scotland, as well as London boroughs and the Northern Ireland Assembly.  The results in Britain will provide a strong marker of the state of play ahead of a general election expected in 2024. Sir Keir denied that Labour has a secret electoral pact with the Liberal Democrats. Asked about claims made by Conservative Party chair Oliver Dowden of a pact, the Labour leader told Sky News: 'I wouldn't take anything Oliver Dowden says particularly seriously. 'The fact that he is spending his Sunday... attacking Labour... why doesn't he say something about the cost-of-living crisis for heaven's sake? 'There is no pact, everybody knows there is no pact. We will put a candidate up when there is a by-election, obviously after the Neil Parish resignation of yesterday.' He later claimed Labour is standing more candidates than ever in the local elections. Mr Dowden claimed Sir Keir was standing down candidates 'in swathes of the country' where Lib Dem support is strong to avoid splitting the anti-Tory vote. And he alleges Sir Ed Davey's party has returned the favour where Labour is dominant elsewhere. In a letter to the Labour leader, which has been seen by The Mail on Sunday, Mr Dowden claimed that Sir Keir planned to 'deny the voters a proper democratic choice' on Thursday.  If the alleged tactics are replicated at a General Election, it could see a return to the days of the Lib-Lab pacts of the 1970s. Lib Dem leader Ed Davey later also denied there was a pact, and accused the Tories of being 'desperate'.  He told the BBC: 'In fact if you look at what we are doing in these local elections, we are fighting Labour in many areas, in Hull, in Sunderland, in Sheffield, in Haringey, in Southwark, I could go on. 'This is pretty desperate from the Conservatives. I am not surprised because lifelong Conservatives are switching away from them because they are really upset that we have a Prime Minister who is not decent to run our country.'",
  "488b21d2155992fb858d5aa6447994ce2e701787e7017ba5d308c471": "Priti Patel and Boris Johnson have been warned by MI5 that Vladimir Putin could send an army of saboteurs to attack public infrastructure including power stations. Britain's domestic counter-intelligence agency is reportedly on 'high alert' amid the fears of Russian agents set to infiltrate the UK. Threats include 'deniable' infrastructure attacks and operations to humiliate the UK government in an effort swing public opinion against Britain's support for Ukraine. 'There is a serious concern that officers or agents attached to Russia's security services may attempt to enter the UK and target strategic locations,' a security source said. Special Branch cops will now increase the monitoring of travellers to the UK, the source told The Sunday Express. Putin's FSB security agency, formerly known as the KGB, is clamouring to restore its reputation amid repeated intelligence failures in Ukraine. One of its most important officers is thought to have been locked up at Moscow's most notorious prison as Putin raged about a flurry of unexpected challenges. The source confirmed Boris Johnson, Home Secretary Priti Patel and GCHQ have been briefed. The Ministry of Defence and the Foreign Office did not comment when contacted by MailOnline.  They added: 'We are well aware of their capabilities and have seen how Putin is using these agencies in Eastern Europe.' The news emerged as Russia is set to unleash a mass of 'troll farms' in a striking disinformation campaign against the UK. New government-funded research revealed today that Moscow is conducting a large-scale cyber operation to spread support for the war in Ukraine over social media and via the comments sections of major news sites. Operatives were found to be ordering followers to target Western media outlets and politicians including Mr Johnson, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell with pro-war comments under their social media posts. One such troll farm - the ominously-named 'Cyber Front Z' - is said to operate out of a rented warehouse in Russia's second city St. Petersburg, where workers are believed to be paid up to 45,000 roubles (PS500) per month to post 200 pro-war and pro-Putin comments per day to platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and TikTok. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said yesterday: 'We cannot allow the Kremlin and its shady troll farms to invade our online spaces with their lies about Putin's illegal war. 'The UK Government has alerted international partners and will continue to work closely with allies and media platforms to undermine Russian information operations.' The Foreign Office was not identifying the researchers behind the work amid concerns over their safety for conducting work critical of the Russian president's regime. Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said: 'These are insidious attempts by Putin and his propaganda machine to deceive the world about the brutality he's inflicting on the people of Ukraine. 'This evidence will help us to more effectively identify and remove Russian disinformation and follows our decisive action to block anyone from doing business with Kremlin-controlled outlets RT and Sputnik.'",
  "6aa6a4a8f24d2103b46017e7f71e84c8b65cc2828c59b963e4efb146": "Tom Parker's widow Kelsey has detailed how she held her husband's hand as he died last month, adding: 'It was still beautiful until the very end.' The Wanted singer Tom died aged 33 following a battle with brain cancer after he was diagnosed with stage 4 glioblastoma in October 2020, and was given just 12 months to live by doctors. He passed away while surrounded by family and his fellow bandmates as he listened to the Oasis song Live Forever, with Kelsey telling The Sun on Sunday she was the last person by his side: 'It was just us and there was so much love in that room.' Mother-of-two Kelsey insisted Tom was in no pain as he died and said she'd told their two-year-old daughter Aurelia that she was going to make sure angels were looking after her father. While she fell in love with Tom as a teenager before he rose to fame with The Wanted, she says her best days with him were those shortly before his death. The boyband star spent his last days in St Christopher's Hospice in South London and Kelsey was there by his side throughout. She said of the time before he died: 'I got into bed with him. We were in bed together for two hours, I just wanted that time with him. I didn't want anyone coming in. We needed that time together to talk.' Kelsey insisted even the days at the hospice with Tom were 'romantic', adding that he 'absolutely worshipped the ground I walked on'. She said he was 'still trying to figure a way out' of his illness a week after he arrived at the hospice.   'I said, 'You know Tom, I will be OK, the kids will be OK. I will make sure that everything you want them to know, the things that you've taught me over the years, I promise to teach them it all.' 'He said, 'I know you're going to be OK.' He then took off his wedding ring and put it on my finger.' Kelsey said she thought Tom knew the end of his life was approaching but he still had 'fight' in him.   In September 2021, 11 months on from his diagnosis, Tom sang at the Stand Up 2 Cancer show at the Royal Albert Hall and even embarked on a Greatest Hits tour with his bandmates when the tumour was confirmed as 'stable' in November. But Tom's condition deteriorated rapidly once the tour came to an end earlier this year. The tragic news of his death was confirmed by Kelsey, who he has left behind along with their two children, Aurelia, two, and Bodhi, one. Kelsey and Tom were last seen in public together at the London 02 Arena on March 15 where Tom performed with his The Wanted bandmates Max George, 33, Jay McGuinness, 31, Siva Kaneswaran, 33, and 29-year-old Nathan Sykes. She was spotted tenderly kissing him on the head before he took to the stage with his group. Kelsey said she was 'so proud' Tom chose to go on tour again but said she noticed something different about him after that performance, putting it down to exhaustion at first. She said he went 'downhill' from there and wanted to go into the hospice while Kelsey would have preferred him to stay at home. Kelsey claims Tom didn't want to put his loved ones through any more pain so chose to seek medical help. Of the day he died, Kelsey said the music in his room was not turned off, describing it as his 'life' and 'passion'. She said how she'd told Tom to give her signs after he died and she went to sit outside and cry after he passed, only to look up and see a feather fall from the sky. Kelsey went on to say she's been honest with her children about everything that's happened but found telling them that their father had died extremely 'tough'. Tom's funeral took place on April 20 as Champagne Supernova by Oasis played in the street while Tom's bandmates carried his coffin. She insists Tom would have loved his funeral, adding that he had no clue about just how many hearts he'd touched during his life. Kelsey concluded by insisting she'll continue to look for the positives in life and will be on the watch for signs from Tom.   After his death last month, Kelsey said in a statement: 'It is with the heaviest of hearts that we confirm Tom passed away peacefully earlier today with all of his family by his side. 'Our hearts are broken. Tom was the centre of our world and we can't imagine life without his infectious smile and energetic presence. 'We are truly thankful for the outpouring of love and support and ask that we all unite to ensure Tom's light continues to shine for his beautiful children.' She went on to thank everyone who has cared for Tom during his illness, adding that he fought the disease until the very end. A statement posted on the band's official Instagram account read: 'The whole Wanted family are devastated by the tragic and premature loss of our bandmate Tom Parker, who passed away peacefully at lunchtime today surrounded by his family and his band mates.   'Tom was an amazing husband to Kelsey, and father to Aurelia and Bodhi. He was our brother, words can't express the loss and sadness we feel. Always and forever in our hearts.' Kelsey reposted a string of tributes from friends on her Instagram Stories in the hours after her husband's death, including many which referred to the devoted couple as 'soulmates.' She commented on a number of the reposts including one from actress Michelle Keegan, who was previously engaged to Tom's bandmate Max George.   Michelle wrote that she was 'absolutely heartbroken for Kelsey,' adding that it 'was an honour to witness first hand their love, they really are the true definition of soul mates.' Kelsey wrote in reply: 'Love you. You knew how our love was so pure and honest, soul mates until the end'. On another post shared by a friend about the cheeky voice notes Tom would leave his loved ones, Kelsey wrote: 'This is Tom Parker everyone. He changed so many lives in such a small amount of time. Tom Parker I f**king love you. Such a legend. Just the fact that he would send messages like this... I mean can you imagine the messages I got.'   Kelsey broke down in tears after paying tribute to her 'soulmate' at the popstar's funeral in south-east London earlier this month, saying: 'If love alone could have saved you, you would have lived forever'. Before the service, The Wanted star's bandmates were pictured carrying the star's black coffin adorned with lilies into the Saint Francis of Assisi Parish Church in Petts Wood.  Kelsey, whom he married in 2018, broke down as she left the service and kissed Tom's coffin, after earlier leading the funeral procession of a horse and carriage through the streets of the couple's local community.   A pre-recorded message from Kelsey was played at his funeral service within which she shared anecdotes about how the pair first met at a nightclub before he shot to fame with The Wanted, adding: 'From that moment I told everyone I wanted to marry Tom Parker.' The congregation erupted into laughter as she said: 'Tom told me he was going to be famous and wouldn't have time for a girlfriend, but he wouldn't leave me alone. 'I will treasure every memory because life with you was never dull. You were always coming up with songs, new game shows and we all know how much you loved an invention - I bet you were gutted you never made it on Dragons' Den.   'Marrying you was the best day of my life... soulmates, that's what we are,' she said, ending the speech by telling Tom: 'If love alone could have saved you, you would have lived forever.' Glioblastoma is considered the most aggressive tumor that can form in the brain.  Patients have a 10 percent chance of surviving five years after their diagnosis, according to figures.  The average lifespan is between 14 and 16 months. Three adults per every 100,000 will be struck down with a glioblastoma, says The American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS). It is most commonly found in men aged 50 to 60, and there is no link between developing glioblastoma and having a previous history with other cancers. WHAT IS THE TUMOR MADE OF?  The tumor is made up of a mass of cells growing quickly in the brain, and in most cases patients have no family history of the disease. It won't spread to other organs, however, once it is diagnosed, it is nearly impossible to target, surgeons claim. WHAT TREATMENT IS AVAILABLE?  Because the tumor likely already spread deep into the brain by the time it is diagnosed, the cancerous tissue is incredibly difficult to remove.  Surgeon will only ever remove the tumor, or part of the tumor, if it won't do any damage to the surrounding brain tissue. Dr Babcar Cisse, a neurosurgeon at the Weill Cornell Brain and Spine Center, told Daily Mail Online in July 2017: 'By the time a glioblastoma is diagnosed, microfibers can spread to the rest of the brain which an MRI would not spot. 'So even if the main tumor is removed and the patient receives radiation and chemotherapy, it will come back.'  GRADING A GLIOBLASTOMA Brain tumors are graded from between one to four, depending on how fast they grow and how aggressive they are. Malignant tumors are either given a high-grade three or four, while benign ones are given a lower grade one or two.  SYMPTOMS Patients typically complain of symptoms such as confused vision, trouble with memory, dizziness and headaches. The symptoms are somewhat nonspecific, and vary from person to person, and may not persist.  The disease is therefore impossible to diagnose based on symptoms alone.",
  "e2e7f6f1c5c137c8d794dfe7ead9c9d64dff15cf7df4873a7f3fd571": "Families face  food prices that rise even higher than they are now and stay high for some time, the boss of Asda warned today. Tory peer Lord Rose said that rocketing raw material costs were going to hit a new permanent high level, which would have a knock-on effect in the aisles. Sunflower oil, wheat and oil prices have been affected by the war in Ukraine, while gas prices were already going skywards before the conflict began in February.  This week it was revealed the price of groceries in Britain is now increasing at its fastest rate in 11 years, adding an extra PS271 to the amount average households will pay at the till this year. Data from market researcher Kantar showed that overall grocery price inflation hit 5.9 per cent this month in what is the fastest rise since December 2011 as the number of items on promotion at supermarkets decreased. Prices are rising fastest in products such as dog and cat food, fresh lamb and beef, savoury snacks and crisps but they are falling in spirits - as surging prices cause the biggest squeeze on UK household incomes since the 1950s. Other products rising most rapidly include frozen potato-based products, canned colas, fresh poultry and milk. Talking to the BBC today, Lord Rose was asked if 5.9 per cent was the ceiling of price rises. He replied: 'They are going to go higher and they are going to stay high for quite some time, I fear.'  It came amid the appearance of a Cabinet rift over whether to target oil and gas firms for a windfall tax on profits made while prices are high and consumers suffer. Labour is pressing for the move, and last week Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he could 'look again' at a new levy as a way to help bring prices down.  But Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said a new tax would be a 'disincentive' to investment. Mr Kwarteng did not rule out the move being considered by the Government as a measure to alleviate the cost-of-living crisis. But he told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday: 'I've never been a supporter of windfall taxes - I've been very clear about that publicly. I think they discourage investment.' And he said on the BBC's Sunday Morning show that 'it doesn't make much sense to me to then hit them (energy firms) with a windfall tax which is arbitrary and unexpected'. 'I don't think that is the right way, but I would say that is not for me. That is for the Chancellor of the Exchequer,' he said. Mr Kwarteng was instead trying to pressure North Sea oil and gas firms to reinvest their profits so more drastic action is not required. He has written to the industry demanding a 'very clear plan' to spend profits on accelerating domestic production and clean energy before a meeting in the coming weeks. Mr Kwarteng told the sector that investing in home-grown energy production is essential to grow the British economy and 'crucially bring down consumer bills in the long term'. Labour said the Government is 'rattled' because oil and gas producers are making 'soaring profits' while bills rocket. Meanwhile there were warnings today that cheap chicken may soon be a thing of the past - with the price of poultry set to skyrocket in the coming months. Marks & Spencer is already retailing organic chicken breasts and organic beef rump steak at PS24.15 per kilogram. The price of chicken is rising faster than any other protein because of feeding costs, rising energy prices and wages rise. The UK's largest chicken supplier 2 Sisters said price inflation of 15 per cent will be needed 'to even begin to cover the increasing cost of production' of the poultry. The Office of National Statistics recorded a 19 per cent rise in the price of chicken between March 2020 and March 2022. Chicken feed is made using soya, a by-product of sunflower oil which has seen massive price rises due to the war between Russia and Ukraine. Russia and Ukraine produce a third of the world's grain - which is used to produce cooking oil - and both are experiencing particularly poor harvests due to the Russian invasion which began on February 24. Supermarkets are even imposing limits on how much cooking oil customers can buy due to supplies being hit by the war in Ukraine.   Lord Rose told the BBC Sunday Morning show: 'We don't know what will happen to gas prices and whatever else and clearly that will be dictated by however long this war goes on for, but I am afraid there is knock-on effect for all raw materials. 'There is going to be a new level of costs for these raw materials and they won't go down. It is a new high and that is something that people are going to have to accommodate. 'What we are now going to have to think about is, is that going to have a long-term effect on inflation because then will we have a wage spiral, or won't we? 'The converse side of that is we could end up, if we have no growth in the business, having stagflation. 'They are both evil and the Government has got a very difficult and tricky road to navigate.'",
  "5b533417b5be2df52bdaa8a1ca7191a118d42f59601abc1050cf3e78": "The economy is the most important issues in a majority of constituencies in Great Britain ahead of Thursday's local elections, according to new research. A new tracker from Survation and Royal Holloway University of London shows that economic issues are the most important in 460 (73 per cent) of the 632 parliamentary constituencies in Great Britain. The modelling will strike fear into Tories as several polls now show that they are less trusted on the economy than Sir Keir Starmer's Labour - in the wake of the controversial National Insurance hike and skyrocketing inflation.  Pressure is growing on Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak over their party's response to the cost-of-living crisis with the Cabinet being reported to have resorted to a desperate roundtable discussion to generate ideas on how to tackle the crisis last week. Sir Keir took the Tories to task on their handling of the crisis during Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) on Wednesday - comparing briefings that the Government was planning in scrapping MOTs to ease cost burdens to Sir John Major's maligned cones helpline. An Ipsos poll published in the Evening Standard on Friday showed that Labour (32 per cent) are seen as the best party on tax with the Tories lagging behind on 25 per cent. Despite the strong focus on the economy, the pandemic still remains the focus of voters in some British cities. Covid (24 per cent) featured heavily in the minds in London, Manchester and Liverpool among the 153 constituencies which rated it as the most important issue for them ahead of Thursday's poll. Some way back in third is Brexit (three per cent) which still lingers in the mind of 17 constituencies, 13 of which are in London - including Battersea, Bermondsey and Old Southwark and Bermondsey and Old Southwark. Other issues which were featured in the modelling included Conduct of Government, Crime, Housing and Immigration amongst others.  The tracker uses multilevel regression and post-stratification (MRP) techniques to show which issues matter most to voters. It does this by predicting what survey respondents say using information on the respondents' characteristics and the characteristics of their area and extrapolating that to constituencies. Commenting on the release of the tracker, Professor Chris Hanretty from Royal Holloway's Democracy and Elections Centre, said: 'MPs often talk about what's important on the doorstep - usually when they want to deflect attention from another issue. 'Now for the first time we've got some insight into what's important at local level. It's going to be interesting cross-checking these results against what MPs say people are telling them.' The focus on the economy will worry Conservatives ahead of the Thursday's local elections - which will see over 200 local authorities elect new councillors across the UK - with more than 4,000 seats up for grabs in England. They include parts of the 'Red Wall' such as Bury, as well as Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and all 32 London boroughs - as well as every seat in Scotland and Wales.  The elections are widely billed as an acid test for Boris Johnson's premiership after a year marred by multiple scandals. - including his fixed penalty notice for his part in the Partygate scandal. A Survation poll released yesterday found Labour has a 13-point advantage in the parts of England choosing councillors next Thursday. Signs are not looking good for Johnson after research by Survation showed the 46.9 per cent to 33.7 per cent margin is even bigger than the 41 per cent to 32 per cent recorded the last time the seats were contested. There have been claims that the Tories are facing losing up to 800 seats - a scale of disaster which Mr Johnson would not be able to dismiss as a mid-term dip. But the outcome could be tricky to interpret as many of the seats were last contested when the UK was still in the EU, Theresa May was in No10 and Labour was led by Jeremy Corbyn. Experts have pointed out that Labour had a very strong performance in 2018, suggesting the party could struggle to make further big gains - despite polls showing a national lead and massive advantage in London.    Although many of the issues that decide local elections remain the same - such as bin collections and services - they will inevitably be interpreted through the prism of Partygate in the wake of Mr Johnson's fine. Restive Conservatives have been holding off a decision on whether to mount a coup until the results come in, meaning the aftermath is likely to be the moment of maximum danger for the PM.  In a number of boroughs such as Wandsworth, Conservative candidates have been adding 'local' to ballot papers in an effort to offset the impact of Partygate.  Labour and the Lib Dems have been accused of giving each other clear runs in seats where they are taking on Conservatives.  However, there are signs that Sir Keir party has been struggling in some areas, with mixed results in council by-elections. Here are some of the key contests to look out for in each region of England, as well as in Wales and Scotland. North-west England Bury - estimated declaration time, 8.30pm Friday May 6 Bury has all of its 51 seats up for grabs this year. Labour has run the council since 2011 but has only a small majority and will want to improve its position in what is the party's traditional heartland of Greater Manchester. Bury's status in this year's elections was reflected by the fact Sir Keir and Mr Johnson both visited the town during the campaign. (E) Bolton - 12.30am Friday May 6 Bolton is another key test for Labour in Greater Manchester, but here it is hoping to take back control from the Conservatives who have run a minority administration since 2019. A third of the council's 60 seats are being contested. (12.30am) Pendle - 4.30pm Friday, May 6 Pendle is being defended by the Conservatives, who won a slim majority last year. If the Tories lose two seats, the council will slip back into no overall control. Elections are taking place for 12 of the 33 seats. (4.30pm) Cumberland and Westmorland & Furness - 1pm Friday, May 6  Two new unitary authorities that will elect councillors for the first time this year. The two authorities cover the whole of Cumbria. Cumberland is comprised of the former district councils of Allerdale, Carlisle and Copeland, while Westmorland & Furness covers Barrow-in-Furness, Eden and South Lakeland. All the main parties will be jostling for prominence in these new 'super-councils' and the outcome in both contests could be close. (Cumberland 2.30am, Westmorland & Furness 1pm) North-east England Sunderland - 2am Friday, May 6 Run by Labour since 1973, but both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have made advances in Sunderland in recent years. A third of the council's 75 seats are up for grabs this year, and if Labour suffers six or more losses it will lose overall control. Although Sunderland is part of Labour's so-called 'Red Wall' - areas of the country that saw many Tory gains at the 2019 general election - all three Sunderland MPs are Labour and the party defied predictions in 2021 when it retained its majority on the council.  Hartlepool - 2am Friday, May 6  The Conservatives and Labour are fighting to be in with a chance of taking overall control of the council - or failing that, end up the largest party and lead a minority administration or a coalition. The Tories won the parliamentary seat of Hartlepool from Labour at a by-election in May 2021. A strong showing by independent candidates could spice up the outcome of this year's contest. Some 13 of the council's 36 seats are being contested. Yorkshire & the Humber Kirklees - 6.30pm Friday, May 6 Currently run by Labour but the party does not have a majority in Kirklees. A third of seats are being elected and just two gains by Labour would give it overall control. Both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats are also hoping to do well.  Wakefield - 5pm Friday, May 6 A Labour stronghold and is not likely to change hands, but the party will be hoping for a solid performance ahead of the expected parliamentary by-election in the city later this year, after Conservative MP Imran Khan was convicted of sexual assault. A third of seats are being contested.  Hull - 3.30am Friday, May 6  Hull is a two-way fight between Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Labour's majority has been whittled away in recent years and the party goes into this year's election defending a majority of one. A third of the council's seats are in play and the Lib Dems are hopeful of victory. (3.30am) West Midlands Dudley - 4am Friday, May 6 A crucial test for both the Conservatives and Labour. The Tories hope to build on the slim majority they secured at the 2021 local elections, while Labour will want to halt the blue advance and make gains themselves. A third of the council is up for grabs. (4am) Solihull - 1pm Friday May 6 Another West Midlands metropolitan council under Conservative control, but the main opposition is the Greens. The party has been slowly eating into the Tories' majority and will hope to take a few more bites this year. One third of Solihull's seats are being contested. Nuneaton & Bedworth - 4am Friday May 6 Dominated by the Conservatives after a bumper performance in last year's elections. Labour will hope to demonstrate it is making a comeback, having controlled the council as recently as 2018. Half of the 34 seats are holding ballots. Newcastle-under-Lyme - 3pm Friday May 6 Set to be a battle royal between Labour and the Conservatives, with every council seat up for grabs and the Tories defending a tiny majority. Success here for Labour would suggest the party is winning back support in one of its target areas of country. The parliamentary seat of Newcastle-under-Lyme was won by the Conservatives in 2019 after being held by Labour for the previous 100 years.  East Midlands Derby - 5am Friday May 6 Derby is currently run by the Tories as a minority party. Labour will be looking to make gains in another test of party's ability to win back support in urban areas of central England. An unknown factor is the popularity of the Reform Derby party, based on the former Brexit Party, which is standing candidates in all the seats being contested. There are 17 of the council's 51 seats up for grabs.  Eastern England St Albans - 4pm Friday May 6 St Albans saw the Liberal Democrats make enough gains in 2021 to take overall control, but with a slim majority. The party will want to improve its numbers this year as an example of how it is now the main opposition to the Conservatives in parts of the so-called 'Blue Wall' of southern England. The entire council is up for election. (4pm) Peterborough - 2.30am Friday May 6  A long-running Conservative-Labour battleground and for decades the council has see-sawed between a Tory majority and no overall control. It is currently run by a minority Conservative administration and Labour will want to make gains to show it is recovering in a city it lost to the Tories at the 2019 general election. A third of seats are being contested.  Basildon - 1am Friday May 6 This Essex battleground could provide clues to how the Conservatives are doing in the commuter belt around London. The party won control of the council last year and will hope to consolidate its position in elections for a third of its 42 seats.  Stevenage - 2.30am Friday, May 6 A commuter-heavy area in Hertfordshire, but this time it is Labour who will be hoping to make progress. The party has controlled the council continuously since its creation in 1973 but will want to show it can reverse the losses it made last year. A third of the seats are up for grabs.  London Barnet - 7am Friday May 6 Labour's top target in London for the third election in a row. The party failed narrowly to win control in 2014, while 2018 saw the council swing further towards the Conservatives, with local Labour members blaming the row over antisemitism in the national party. Labour needs to gain nine seats to form a majority. As with every council in London, all seats are being elected.  Wandsworth - 5.30am Friday May 6 Another long-standing Labour target, but here the party managed to increased its number of councillors in both 2014 and 2018. The Tories have held the council since 1978 and have made a point of charging residents one of the lowest average levels of council tax in the country, so a Labour victory would be of symbolic significance.  Hillingdon - 4am Friday May 6  This borough contains the constituency of the Prime Minister and has been controlled by the Conservatives since 2006. Labour is hoping to make gains, but the outcome is hard to predict as the size of the council is being cut from 65 to 53 seats. Westminster - 3am Friday May 6 A flagship borough held by the Tories continuously since its creation in 1964. But Labour has slowly increased its number of councillors at recent elections and will want to make more progress this time. Given the current volatile political climate, plus a reduction in the size of the council from 60 to 54 seats, the final result could be close.  Harrow - 5pm Friday May 6  A council where the reduction in the number of seats from 63 to 55 could work in either Labour or the Conservatives' favour. Labour won a narrow majority in both 2014 and 2018 but the borough's electoral districts have been substantially redrawn for 2022 and both parties could profit from the new-look map.  Sutton - 4am Friday May 6 A Liberal Democrat-Conservative battleground that has been run by the Lib Dems since 1990. The party should retain control again this year, but the Tories will hope to make gains and chip away at the Lib Dems' small overall majority.  South-east England Crawley - 2pm Friday, May 6 Has tilted between Conservative and Labour control in recent years but neither party has an overall majority. It would take only a couple of gains for either the Tories or Labour to take full control of a council deep in the commuter belt of West Sussex. A third of seats are being contested.  Gosport - 5pm Friday May 6 The council sees the Conservatives, who have only a small majority, under pressure from the second-place Lib Dems. All the seats are up for grabs and boundary changes across the borough means the outcome will be even more unpredictable.  Worthing - 2pm Friday May 6 A top Labour target and the party goes into the election level-pegging with the Conservatives on 17 seats each. The Tories currently run the council as a minority administration but Labour has made steady gains in recent years and is hoping to take full control this year. A third of seats are being elected. Southampton - 5am Friday May 6 Another Labour target and winning control from the Conservatives would help demonstrate the party is building back support in southern towns and cities. The Tories are defending a majority of two and a third of the seats are being contested.  South-west England Somerset - 4pm Friday May 6 Undergoing major changes this year in its system of local government. Until now the area has had a county council and four district councils (Mendip, Sedgemoor, South Somerset and Somerset West & Taunton) but these are being scrapped and replaced with a single unitary authority. Elections are taking place for all 110 seats in the new-look organisation, with the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats fighting for control.  Wales Blaenau Gwent - 3pm Friday, May 6 This council has been run by a group of independents since 2017, some of whom used to be in the Labour Party. Labour is keen to take back control and might be helped by a reduction in the number of seats from 42 to 33.  Cardiff - 5pm Friday May 6 A key council for Labour, where the party will hope to defend its slim majority. The number of councillors is being increased slightly from 75 to 79, which might make the outcome more unpredictable.  Flintshire - 3pm Friday May 6  Sits in an area of Wales, the north east, where the Conservatives did well at the 2019 general election. The party won only six council seats in 2017 compared with Labour's 34, so they are hoping to make an advance this year. For its part, Labour will want to remain the largest party and even win a majority, although the total number of seats is being cut from 70 to 67.  Scotland Aberdeenshire - 3pm Friday May 6 A Conservative stronghold, but like many councils in Scotland, power is shared between several parties. All councils in Scotland are elected using the single transferable vote (STV) system, where voters rank candidates and results are based on preferences rather than the winner-takes-all method used in England. This leads to many councils ending in no overall control, but encourages parties to work together either informally or as part of a coalition. The Tories have run Aberdeenshire in partnership with the Lib Dems and a group of Independents. Their success this year may hinge on the popularity in Scotland of the Tories' UK leader Mr Johnson. East Renfrewshire - 2pm Friday May 6 A three-way battle between the Conservatives, Labour and the SNP with each hoping to end up the largest party.  Edinburgh - 3.30pm Friday May 6 The council has been run by a joint SNP-Labour administration for the last five years, but the Conservatives head into this election as the largest party on the council. The Lib Dems and Greens have a smaller number of councillors but both will hope to make gains from the larger parties.  Glasgow - 4pm Friday May 6  The council has been run by the SNP since 2017 in what has been their first stint in control of the city, albeit as a minority administration. The party needs only a few gains to take full control, but Labour - which had previously run the city since 1980 - is keen to stop them.",
  "50165e0fbe1160d9f9b295638578434ba4b52d909d7067e1692c3ef9": "The Business Secretary has ordered the country's oil and gas giants to reinvest their profits to boost the UK's energy supply and help to ease the cost of living crisis. Kwasi Kwarteng has written to energy companies asking them to set out a clear plan on how they will use their huge windfalls to fire up domestic production. It comes amid continuing sky-high profits being made by the energy firms on the back of surging global energy prices. Last week Chancellor Rishi Sunak opened the door to a windfall tax on oil and gas companies. He had previously dismissed the idea saying he did not want to stem investment by those companies in new oil and gas extraction. Mr Kwarteng said he would also 'not bend to the will of activists who naively want us to extinguish production' and repeated the Government's commitment to North Sea oil and gas. He added: 'I want to see a very clear plan from the oil and gas industry to reinvest profits in the North Sea and, importantly, in the clean energy technologies of the future.'",
  "2d64d1fe4fa70a9ef3c5f20378c87dd9a2f96d69c7c4a984691a987b": "Actor Bill Murray has broken his silence about his 'inappropriate behavior' on the set of his latest movie 'Being Mortal' that led to it being shut down last week.  Murray told CNBC that he had a 'difference of opinion' with a woman he was working with on the film, but did not name the woman or give any details about what happened. The film, which was written and being directed by comedian Aziz Anzari, was set to star Seth Rogan and Keke Palmer, as well as Murray.  'I did something I thought was funny and it wasn't taken that way,' he told CNBC during a special interview at Berkshire Hathaway's earnings event on Saturday. 'As of now we are talking and we are trying to make peace with each other,' Murray said. 'We are both professionals, we like each others' work, we like each other I think and if we can't really get along and trust each other there's no point in going further working together or making the movie as well. It's been quite an education for me.' Searchlight Pictures suspended production on the film after Murray was accused of inappropriate behavior, Variety reported. A letter was sent to the cast and crew informing them of the situation.  Filming on Being Mortal was halways completed before production was shut down and it was slated for release in 2023, but for now it is unclear if Murray will continue on with the project or if he will be recast.  A letter to the cast and crew, seen by Deadline, said: 'We know you are all concerned about the recent delays in production and want to give you an update. 'Late last week, we were made aware of a complaint, and we immediately looked into it. 'After reviewing the circumstances, it has been decided that production cannot continue at this time.' The statement added: 'We are truly grateful to all of you for everything you've put into this project. 'Our hope is to resume production and are working with Aziz and Youree to figure out that timing.'  'Being Mortal,' based on Atul Gawande's nonfiction book 'Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End,' starred Murray, as well as Aziz Ansari and Seth Rogan.  Murray told CNBC that he was optimistic that 'we are going to make peace' and that production will restart, but added that he'll only do so if the woman is comfortable doing so. 'I think it's a sad dog that can't learn anymore,' Murray said. 'That's a really sad puppy that can't learn anymore. I don't want to be that sad dog and I have no intention of it.' 'What would make me the happiest would be to put my boots on and for both of us to go back into work and be able to trust each other and work at the work that we've both spent a lot of time developing the skill of,' he added. This is not the first incident Murray has encountered on a film set.  On the set of the 2000 action-comedy 'Charlie's Angels,' actress Lucy Liu reportedly confronted Murray for 'hurling insults' at her following a rewrite of a scene without his knowledge, Variety reported.  Liu addressed the incident for the first time last year. She called Murray's behavior 'inexcusable and unacceptable.'  Lui claimed on a 2021 Asian Enough podcast episode that the team had to rework a scene so Murry could attend a family gathering.  'As we're doing the scene, Bill starts to sort of hurl insults, and I won't get into the specifics, but it kept going on and on. I was, like: 'Wow, he seems like he's looking straight at me.' 'Some of the language was inexcusable and unacceptable, and I was not going to just sit there and take it. So, yes, I stood up for myself, and I don't regret it. Because no matter how low on the totem pole you may be or wherever you came from, there's no need to condescend or to put other people down. And I would not stand down, and nor should I have.' Murray defended his actions in The Times of London in 2009, stating: 'Look, I will dismiss you completely if you are unprofessional and working with me.' The star also reportedly headbutted Charlie's Angel's director Joseph McGinty Nichol - known professionally as McG, 'square on the head.'  'An inch later and my nose would have been obliterated,' he told the Guardian in 2009.  Murray denied the claim, telling the Times: 'That's bulls**t! That's complete crap! I don't know why he made that story up. He has a very active imagination.' The Ghostbusters star also famously got into an altercation on the SNL set in 1978 with Chevy Chase.  The fight reportedly broke out have the pair started to throw insults at each other. Murray importantly told Chase to go have sex with his then-wife Jacqueline Carlin. Chase retorted Murray's face look 'like something Neil Armstrong landed on,' according to the book Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live.   Murray alsoo once threw an ashtray at Richard Dreyfuss' head after a 'meltdown' on set of What About Bob. Dreyfuss' son Ben, 35, revealed on Twitter on Thursday that Murray allegedly threw an ashtray at his father's head and threatened to 'throw' a female producer across a parking lot and 'ripped off her glasses' during the meltdown after being denied an extra day off on the What About Bob set in 1991.  Ben also revealed bodyguards had to be on set once filming resumed to separate the Murray and Dreyfuss, 74.  'Everyone walked off the production and flew back to LA and it only resumed after Disney hired some bodyguards to physically separate my dad and Bill Murray in between takes,' he said in a tweet.  Ben also revealed that he was 'like five' when the altercation happened, but still said it was some of his 'fondest and earliest memories' and praised the movie as being 'good.' The rumor of the ashtray incident, among others, have apparently been circling Hollywood for decades and Dreyfuss even addressed it in 2009.  'He put his face next to me, nose-to-nose, and he screamed at the top of his lungs, 'Everyone hates you! You are tolerated!' the actor said at the time.  'There was no time to react because he leaned back and he took a modern glass-blown ashtray. He threw it at my face from [only a couple feet away]. And it weighed about three-quarters of a pound. And he missed me. He tried to hit me. I got up and left.'   Dreyfuss had complained about Murray's behavior toward 'petite' producer Laura Ziskin, who denied Murray the day off. In 2013, she revealed to the Los Angeles Times: 'Bill ... threatened to throw me across the parking lot and then broke my sunglasses and threw them across the parking lot.'  Ziskin has since died from breast cancer and the pair never worked together again.  It eventually turned physical in front of several costars, including Laraine Newman, who described it as a 'very sad and painful and awful' on What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2021.  This isn't Murray's first fight on set, he reportedly got physical with director Harold Ramis on Groundhog Day. The director allegedly threw the actor against the wall during the dispute. Ramis' daughter claimed Murray didn't talk to the director for 20 years after the fight and that Ramis' was 'heartbroken.'  Murray also reportedly hurt The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou costar Anjelica Huston's feelings after he didn't invite her out to a dinner party during filming.  'The first week I was there [filming in Italy], we were all in this little hotel, and he invited the entire cast to go and have dinner, except me,' she said in 2019.  The 71-year-old actor had the complaint filed against him last week before Aziz Ansari and Seth Rogan's Being Mortal was temporarily shelved, it was claimed. The details of the allegations were not immediately clear but Searchlight Pictures said an investigation has been launched. Searchlight temporarily stopped production on Monday after the allegations against Murray emerged - but today said it would halt indefinitely pending investigation. A letter to the cast and crew, seen by Deadline, said: 'We know you are all concerned about the recent delays in production and want to give you an update. 'Late last week, we were made aware of a complaint, and we immediately looked into it. 'After reviewing the circumstances, it has been decided that production cannot continue at this time.' The statement added: 'We are truly grateful to all of you for everything you've put into this project. 'Our hope is to resume production and are working with Aziz and Youree to figure out that timing.' Being Mortal is an adaptation of the 2014 book by surgeon Atul Gawande, Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End. The movie, written by Aziz Ansari, was scheduled for release in 2023 but it is unclear how the suspension will impact this.",
  "1cd66e2ce1096defbf8cef2097a43f37d901caf300257c9819172b93": "Two students who filmed a video of Sir Keir Starmer swigging beer with Labour officials during lockdown have accused him of breaking Covid rules. Speaking to The Mail on Sunday, they cast doubt on the Labour leader's claim that he was not in breach of the rules because he was attending a work meeting. And in comments that will heap more pressure on Durham Constabulary to investigate the incident, both said they were prepared to make detailed statements to officers about what they saw. The university students, who asked to remain anonymous, filmed a 43-second video of Sir Keir drinking a beer and chatting with colleagues just after 10pm on April 30 last year. At the time, indoor socialising was banned and those who disobeyed the rules faced being fined by police. While repeatedly lambasting Boris Johnson over the 'Partygate' scandal, Sir Keir has repeatedly insisted that no rules were broken during his trip to Durham and continues to say that he returned to work after the 10pm drinks. But his defence is now under fresh scrutiny after the Daily Mail last week forced Labour to admit that Deputy Leader Angela Rayner was at the Durham Miners Hall on the same day, having previously denied it. The MoS can today reveal that Sir Keir, local Labour MP Mary Foy and a mystery woman, who may have been Ms Rayner, were actually gathered in a narrow kitchen next to Ms Foy's office. The eyewitnesses said the trio and other Labour officials, who were standing in a narrow corridor outside, appeared to be socialising. 'I have never seen a work meeting with people sitting on tables, drinking San Miguel and standing around eating off plates,' one said. 'They weren't having a meeting. There is a clear difference between a meeting and what was happening there, which was entirely social.' After watching for five minutes, the pair went back to their accommodation. They returned an hour later and saw that people were still inside the room. They could not see if Sir Keir was among them. Durham Police are facing mounting calls from Tory Ministers and MPs to launch a new probe, having announced in February that no rules had been broken. Both witnesses said they are prepared to help the police. 'We are the only two eyewitnesses that aren't trying to defend it,' one said. 'I would be so happy to talk to them and tell them the truth.' About three weeks before Sir Keir's trip to Durham, factory worker Tyler James, 20, from Chester-le-Street, Durham, was fined PS400 for also holding a balloon-releasing memorial for a friend who died in March 2021. 'It just makes you think, it's one rule for them, and one rule for us,' he said. 'I don't understand, if Boris Johnson was fined, why wasn't he?' Durham Constabulary said: 'We have since received further communications on this subject and will now consider the content of those communications and respond in due course.'",
  "ab839ecd82b6c6657ef183f253d663ea29582aa2a255654b988f775d": "Sir Keir Starmer was last night accused of 'misleading the public' as fresh questions were raised over his account of swigging beer with colleagues during lockdown. The Labour leader has consistently denied breaking Covid rules after he and several party officials were caught on camera chatting over beers on April 30 last year when indoor socialising was banned. He insists they had been working at Durham Miners Hall but stopped for food before resuming their work. Interviewed on LBC radio in January, Sir Keir said: 'No restaurants were open, no pubs were open. The hotel we were staying in had no food, they didn't run food. So if you didn't get a takeaway then our team wasn't eating that evening.' But The Mail on Sunday can reveal that Sir Keir stayed at the Radisson Blu hotel in Durham - and that its restaurant was serving food outside on its terrace until 9pm. A source at the hotel recalled Sir Keir and a 'number of aides' staying there last April and confirmed the exact date after being shown pictures posted by Sir Keir on Twitter showing him in the city the following day. 'I can't tell you how many people were with him, but he had a lot of aides,' the source said. 'At the time, we were serving limited food and there was room service. It wasn't like the first lockdown when the bar and restaurant were closed.' On April 12 last year - more than a fortnight before Sir Keir's visit to Durham - the hotel announced on Facebook: 'The day has finally arrived where we can welcome you to drink and dine with us outside. 'Serving food including afternoon tea from 12pm to 9pm weekends and 3pm to 9pm through the week.' On April 30, the day of Sir Keir's 'Beergate' drinks, the hotel posted a bank holiday menu, including a 10oz steak and glass of wine for PS25. A 43-second video of Sir Keir drinking was filmed just after 10pm that night after he had spent the day on the campaign trail. He and his deputy, Angela Rayner, also took part in a video call with party members which is understood to have finished at 9.20pm. Labour last night declined to say when Sir Keir checked into his hotel or whether there had been a chance for him to eat there before the restaurant closed. The revelations come after Labour was forced to admit Ms Rayner had been at the Miners Hall gathering, having previously categorically insisted in response to Daily Mail questions: 'Angela wasn't there.' Last night, a Tory source said: 'When Keir Starmer was first asked about this, he claimed he had to drink alcohol and eat inside with others because his hotel wasn't serving food. This now appears to be false. The same people who have been caught twice misleading the public about this are asking them to believe Keir Starmer stopped working at 10pm on a Friday to drink beers with activists then returned to work. Nobody does this. Labour should come clean now and refer this matter to the police.' A Labour spokesman said: 'Keir Starmer was in the workplace, meeting a local MP in her constituency office and participating in an online Labour Party event. 'They paused for food as the meeting was during the evening. No rules were broken.' By Jacinta Taylor  People do tend to congregate in kitchens at parties, but Sir Keir Starmer insists that on the night of 'Beergate' he was there only while taking a short break from work. As our exclusive picture shows, the Labour leader swigged alcohol and chatted with colleagues in a small kitchen with little scope for social distancing. With a double row of white kitchen cupboards and no obvious seating, the room on the ground floor of Miners Hall - the 100-year-old home of the Durham Miners' Association - is far from an ideal work environment. The kitchen is at the end of a long corridor in what was a suite of offices that were being used last year by Durham's Labour MP Mary Foy. She is understood to have subsequently moved ahead of renovations. A 43-second video recorded on April 30 last year shows Sir Keir enjoying a bottle of beer by the kitchen window. A second bottle is on the window sill. He was talking to Ms Foy and a second woman, the back of whose head was visible. There has been speculation that it could be Labour Deputy Leader Angela Rayner after her party last week admitted she had been at Miners Hall that day, contradicting previous denials. Neither Sir Keir, who would have been standing with his back to a kitchen counter, nor Mrs Foy are wearing masks and appear closer than two metres from each other. At the time, England was in Step 2 of its lockdown roadmap which banned indoor socialising with people not in your support bubble. Sir Keir has insisted the drinks were 'perfectly lawful', adding: 'I was in a constituency office. We were very busy. We were working.'",
  "7d460fe75992f441c2a4497aaea8e8ef5abc7ca40dbf3eaeecab73de": "Partners of pregnant women have been ordered by some hospitals to sit in separate waiting rooms in 'unnecessary' Covid restrictions, The Mail on Sunday has learnt.  One father-to-be who went through this in Luton last week said it is done to 'dissuade' anyone accompanying women.  He and his partner were attending an early six-week scan, which is often booked when there are concerns about complications.  He told the MoS: 'It seems cruel to keep couples apart just as they are at their most nervous.'  This newspaper's Lone Births campaign highlighted the plight of pregnant women forced to attend appointments and labour alone due to Covid restrictions.  A year ago, official guidance made it clear hospital trusts should find 'creative solutions' to ensure women had support at 'all stages' of pregnancy and labour.  Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the Luton and Dunstable University Hospital and Bedford Hospital Maternity Units, said last week it changed its rules to allow partners to sit in the same waiting area as expecting mothers, but added there 'may have been a slight delay for the changes to be implemented'.  A spokesman said: 'We do sincerely apologise for any upset or confusion this may have caused.'",
  "0cb8303357eb33fa21a9afa32bfd0196293bb541188e4ea53f18bb8b": "A British Minister flew to the British Virgin Islands for crisis talks last night as calls grew for the UK to take direct control of the overseas territory after its premier was held on drugs trafficking charges. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Amanda Milling, the Minister for Overseas Territories, was travelling to the Caribbean for urgent talks with the Governor and other leaders. Premier Andrew Fahie, 51, was arrested on Thursday in Miami by US agents posing as members of a Mexican drug cartel. He allegedly demanded PS560,000 to let the fake traffickers move Colombian cocaine worth millions of pounds through the British Virgin Islands (BVI) to Miami and New York. BVI official Oleanvine Maynard and her son Kadeem were also held. Fahie allegedly told a US informant that the UK had been trying to remove him from office for years. He is quoted in court papers as telling the informant: 'I have plenty of people and I don't sell them out to the British with their plans... they always want to capture people, but me, I see what they are doing, and I protect the people.' He also allegedly said: 'The British don't pay me much.' The BVI operates as a parliamentary democracy, with the premier acting as head of the elected government alongside Governor John Rankin, a British civil servant appointed by the UK Government. It includes more than 50 islands with a total population of more than 35,000. In an unrelated development on Friday, a critical 946-page report by a British judge recommended the BVI should be temporarily returned to UK rule. The inquiry was ordered by Governor Rankin last year and headed by British judge Sir Gary Hickinbottom, who vowed to 'investigate the corruption, abuse of office and other serious dishonesty'. It found millions in state funds were squandered annually by BVI politicians 'without proper process, along with serious dishonesty in relation to sales of public property and Crown land'. Governor Rankin said the report showed that 'unless the most drastic and urgent steps are taken' the alleged abuses 'will go on indefinitely'. The report recommended a 'temporary suspension' of the BVI government and constitution for two years and a return to direct rule from London. Ms Truss said: 'Substantive legislative and constitutional change is required to restore the standards of governance.'",

Mr Hunt - who came second to Mr Johnson in the 2019 contest - is lining up supporters and sounding out potential Cabinet Ministers in anticipation of the Prime Minister losing a confidence vote in the wake of Thursday's local elections. The prospect has been greeted with dismay by Cabinet allies of Mr Johnson, one of whom last night described Mr Hunt as 'Theresa May without the personality'. Mr Hunt, who backed Remain in the 2016 EU referendum, is understood to have been brazenly courting pro-Brexit MPs by distancing himself from his previous views. Chancellor Rishi Sunak had long been tipped as Mr Johnson's successor.  But the fall in his political fortunes since the revelations about his wife's tax status has been seized upon by Mr Hunt's team, with Mr Sunak's supporters in the One Nation group of Tory MPs being actively courted.  A source said: 'Six weeks ago you would have said it's a done deal, Rishi's got it. Not any more.' Mr Hunt, who was also a long-serving Health Secretary, is expected to brand himself as a 'safe pair of hands' after Mr Johnson's roller-coaster premiership.  Another supporter said he was 'Mrs Thatcher's soulmate', economically. A senior Hunt supporter said: 'He's definitely running. There's a significant groundswell of support.' The South West Surrey MP has publicly said his ambition to be leader has not 'completely vanished' - although supporters insist he would not be the one to directly trigger a leadership challenge. MPs say he has assembled a team around him, including ex-Cabinet Minister Andrew Mitchell. A eurosceptic Tory MP said: 'He's going round seeing everyone to test the waters. He says he is pro-Brexit now, that he is not going to reverse it. He's a nice bloke, but I don't know what the question is, if 'Jeremy Hunt' is the answer.' Tom Tugendhat, the foreign affairs committee chair, is also said to be planning a leadership bid.",
  "28a10bdc597780033b9bfda6f90fc4d8e146fc0e689cc8d88aa72d73": "Parliament's 'Pestminster' scandal deepened last night amid claims that a senior Tory MP pestered a female staff member for 'sexual favours'. The Mail on Sunday understands the claims were so serious that party bosses were advised to take them 'straight to the police'. There were also claims that another MP offered a member of his staff a taxpayer-funded pay rise but only on condition that part of the increase came to him. Sources said that claim was in a 'dossier of shame' against MPs compiled by a Commons staffer. This paper understands the damning charge sheet details more than 90 accusations from sexual harassment to bribery. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle acknowledged the scale of the crisis yesterday by launching an urgent review that could lead to MPs being stripped of the right to employ their own staff to stop intimidation and harassment. Instead, the workers would be employed either by the Commons directly or by the parliamentary expenses authority IPSA. Unveiling a special 'Speaker's Conference' on the issue, Sir Lindsay said: 'I take recent allegations of bullying and sexual impropriety very seriously, which is why it is time we reviewed our working practices, particularly whether it is right that individual MPs are the employers of their staff.' This would be resisted by many MPs who insist they must know their staff are loyal to them above all - not to an outside employer. The 'Pestminster' scandal, which first broke in 2017, was revived last week after reports that three members of the Cabinet and two of Sir Keir Starmer's top team were facing sexual misconduct allegations. They were said to be among 56 MPs and 70 complaints overall referred to Parliament's Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS), set up in 2018. The ICGS has refused to 'confirm or deny any current investigations'. But ICGS director Jo Willows wrote privately to all MPs, saying there were only 15 'cases' against MPs for bullying, harassment or sexual misconduct in the 12 months to June 2021 and that it was a 'similar' trend so far this year. However, Commons sources confirmed the existence of a separate list of complaints against at least 60 individual MPs. Jenny Symmons, of the GMB union branch for MPs' staff, said: 'The only way to get to the root of the problem is to stop MPs directly employing their staff. It is clear many complaints by staff are withdrawn because they understandably fear they will lose their jobs.'",
  "b3d3082ed4e68d1cfc7f170875dd62caf5d55acaed88b4b78a3b796c": "The Labour Party and its many media allies have spent much of the past week in a state of prune-faced hypocrisy, denouncing The Mail on Sunday for accurately reporting what Angela Rayner had in fact openly said to fellow MPs. It is easy to understand why Ms Rayner, the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, might want to divert attention from her own behaviour. The party she helps to lead is constantly pulling long, disapproving faces about actions and words which used to be regarded as harmless but must now be pursued with fury and, if possible, prosecuted as thought crimes. Hardly a week goes by without demands from the Left-wing establishment that somebody should be sacked or cancelled for such an offence. Of course some of the things which are exposed and attacked are truly wicked and need to be acted against. But not all of them are, as we see, and these purse-lipped moralists are themselves no better than they ought to be. Labour greets such events like a Victorian maiden lady glimpsing an unclothed table leg, shrieking for her smelling salts, even though it must know that plenty of its own supporters, perhaps even some members of its upper echelons, are often guilty of saying such things. Indeed, modern Left-wing 'alternative' comedy (to which there is in fact very little alternative) is packed with such material. As we know from Sir Keir Starmer's contortions over his lockdown beer break in Durham, Labour does not think the rules in general apply to itself. After weeks of yelling about Partygate, Sir Keir crossly tries to pretend that there is no parallel between it and his own behaviour. As we know from the party's reluctant and long-delayed admission that Ms Rayner was present at this event (how can they not have known?), Labour's machine puts truth a poor second after its propaganda needs. It was fascinating to see that what Ms Rayner no doubt regarded as amusing conversation was suddenly converted into evil and unforgivable 'misogyny' when it was accurately described by others and reported equally accurately in this newspaper. Glen Owen, The Mail on Sunday's Political Editor and author of the story at the centre of the row, puts it neatly in his account of these events today. He says: 'Ms Rayner was professing herself outraged by something she had laughed about before - and had herself helped to propagate.' Any decent person will be shocked at the vicious and obscene tone of the Twitter abuse of Mr Owen which followed. The episode will, in the long run, turn out to be embarrassing for Ms Rayner and all those who joined the electronic lynch mob. Yet they have still to climb down properly, let alone express true regret for their behaviour. Meanwhile, the basic point remains: The Mail on Sunday was attacked for reporting what Ms Rayner had said. You might have thought that in the midst of the biggest foreign-policy crisis in Europe since 1945, with naked war raging in Ukraine, Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition might have had more important things to do than to make unjust attacks on this newspaper and Mr Owen. But you would have been wrong. Since the Blair era began a quarter of a century ago, the Labour Party has been ever keener to destroy its critics through derision, spite and personal attack, while barely bothering to offer a serious political argument. It has relied instead on crudity, abuse, evasion of true debate, and caricature. This is perhaps because it has a low opinion of its own policies and its own ability to deliver the expansive promises it never ceases to make, and never ceases to break. It returned to power after a long and deserved exile 25 years ago claiming to be the scourge of sleaze, while rapidly turning out to be up to its chin in sleaze itself. No wonder it preferred smears to reasoned argument. Its tone was set in a crude, childish and dishonest Election broadcast of April 21, 1997, in which speeded-up footage of a Tory conference was shown to mock Conservative leaders and supporters, and a caption told the blatant lie that a re-elected Tory government would abolish the state pension. In any other walk of life but politics, this cruel falsehood, clearly intended to win votes by terrifying the old and lonely, would have led to censure and possibly actual prosecution. But it was forgotten in the Election victory it helped to bring about. Only later, when a Labour spin doctor remarked that the terrorist mass murders of 9/11 provided 'a good day to bury bad news' did the nation begin to grasp the deep cynicism of this once-idealistic movement. The heirs of Keir Hardie and Clement Attlee, true apostles of compassion and serious reform, turned out to be less principled than a bunch of bookmakers. This is the sorry background to events of last week. With local elections due on Thursday and with almost nothing to say about politics or the future of the nation, Keir Starmer's strategists saw a chance to look good and to hamstring their media critics.  At one point even the Speaker of the Commons, the generally measured and thoughtful Sir Lindsay Hoyle, was caught up in the tsunami of hysteria. So were some Tories, in a party that has sometimes not tried very hard to distinguish itself from New Labour's attitudes and methods. Caroline Nokes, a Conservative MP who called for Glen Owen's parliamentary pass to be revoked, may need to do some revoking of her own now it is clear she rushed to judgment long before she knew the facts. This newspaper's case was succinctly made by its Editor, David Dillon, when he wrote to Sir Lindsay declining an offered meeting, saying: 'The Mail on Sunday deplores sexism and misogyny in all its forms. However, journalists must be free to report what they are told by MPs about conversations which take place in the House of Commons, however unpalatable some may find them.' He said that press freedom was in danger 'if journalists have to take instruction from officials of the House of Commons, however august they may be, on what they can report and not report'. This is absolutely correct and rather alarming. A strong counter-attack by this newspaper and its sister the Daily Mail, plus the good sense of some others in the media and Parliament, successfully beat off the lynch mob which sought to punish us for telling the truth. Not everybody attacked in this way has the resources or the fortitude to stand up to such assaults. Britain's political and media classes, up to and including the Leader of the Opposition and the Speaker, are going to have to re-learn old rules such as the one that advises waiting for the facts before passing judgment, and that trial comes before verdict, and verdict before sentence. If they do not, and if they continue to allow themselves to be stampeded by social media mobs, then freedom of speech, freedom of the press and democracy itself are in danger. It really is that serious.",
  "5677edc307e3266d0cd3cdf1ebfca83e152ab8a8eeb3f5dedb877814": "Good Morning Britain weatherman Alex Beresford has called in the police after being targeted by racist trolls on Twitter. The TV presenter reported an incident to the Metropolitan Police last month after experiencing an unprecedented level of personal attacks on the social-media platform. Friends of the 41-year-old say he was furious at the degree of abuse and, after years of grimly tolerating the slurs, finally decided to take action. One tweet, describing him as a 'black ****', was reported to Twitter, but the social-media firm claimed it did not break its safety policies. A source close to Mr Beresford said: 'He gets so much hate on Twitter and, after this particularly despicable comment, he decided to go to the police. They are now looking into it. 'Alex calls a lot of these people out and tries to shame them but it reaches the point where they have to be properly investigated by officials. 'The level of abuse towards him is extraordinary, it is a disgrace. Like many celebrities he will take so much but it gets to the point when something serious needs to be done and the authorities have to get involved.' Friends of the Bristol-born presenter say that he was dismayed by the response of Twitter to his complaint about the racist tweet. In its reply, the social media giant wrote: 'After reviewing the available information we want to let you know that @AndrewH1508 hasn't broken our safety rules. We know this isn't the answer you're looking for. If this account breaks our policies in the future, we'll notify you.' Twitter suggested that Mr Beresford simply blocks the troll. The weatherman has the full support of his ITV bosses who last year announced a major diversity and inclusion initiative to support the network's ethnic minority staff. Last year he said on GMB: 'Some of the things I see on Twitter, well, I would not even read out on this programme. So yes, it is a shame social media has gone that way.' Mr Beresford, who recently revealed that he is engaged to his partner, Imogen McKay, became a household name after clashing with Piers Morgan on GMB over the Duchess of Sussex's interview with Oprah Winfrey. Their debate ended with Morgan walking off of the programme. The following day, it was announced that he would not be returning after he refused to apologise for his views, citing free speech. A record 58,000 complaints about Mr Morgan were made to television regulator Ofcom but ITV were cleared following investigation.",

Bough, who died aged 87 in October 2020, fronted the BBC sports show Grandstand for 15 years.  He also co-hosted the early evening news magazine show Nationwide for a decade and presented the BBC's first early morning programme Breakfast Time in 1983. But his avuncular image was shattered in 1988 when it emerged that he had snorted cocaine with prostitutes while watching couples having sex - a habit that he blamed on the pressure of work. Efforts to rehabilitate his career ended in 1992 when he was pictured leaving the flat of a prostitute who specialised in sadomasochism. The disgraced presenter later expressed his regret at his behaviour, saying he had been 'exceedingly stupid'. Throughout it all, Nesta, his wife of 61 years, stayed with him.

  "765ce52e3c712a52d66866abb5ec0982ee920dd64bc2dfa261ae1bc1": "Stripping civil servants of the extra pay they receive for working in London could save the taxpayer hundreds of millions of pounds. No 10 is determined to drag Whitehall out of its post-Covid malaise by forcing mandarins out of their home offices and back into city centres. In an article for The Mail on Sunday last week, Jacob Rees-Mogg - the Minister charged with reversing the work-from-home culture - implied that civil servants based in the capital could see their London weighting pay subsidies scrapped if they do not return to work for the majority of the week. According to calculations by the TaxPayers' Alliance pressure group, removing the subsidy - which is awarded to offset the higher cost of living in the capital - from those who work from home three days a week or more would save up to PS250 million. If such a move was imposed, it would affect many working at the Home Office, the Ministry of Justice, the Cabinet Office and the Department for Work and Pensions, who are currently being asked to go into the office for just two days a week. The Cabinet Office last night insisted that the estimate was too high because more London-based civil servants are going into work for the majority or all of the time. But Tory MPs welcomed the idea. Sir Iain Duncan Smith, MP for Chingford and Woodford Green, said: 'If they simply refuse to come back to work for the majority of the week surely London weighting should be removed. They are paid to come into work, and if they are not, they should not get that money.' Danielle Boxall, media manager at the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Taxpayers facing a cost of living crisis want to know they are getting value for money from the Civil Service. If mandarins insist on going remote long-term, officials must make savings.' Using data from the 2016 Trust for London and Loughborough University Centre for Research in Social Policy report, 'London Weighting and London Costs', which details the average public sector top up for the capital, the lobbying group estimates that PS251,012,767 could be saved if a three-day rule was imposed. For each Civil Service pay band, apart from 'senior' civil servants, the difference between national and London salaries is about PS4,000. Meanwhile, updated figures from across Whitehall show that in the week beginning April 18, the Cabinet Office and the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office had fewer staff in the office than before the pandemic. Asked about the TaxPayers' Alliance analysis, a Government spokesman said: 'These figures are inaccurate and misleading about pay for civil servants in London.' By Molly Clayton  A multi-million-pound council headquarters has been left largely empty after staff were asked to return to their desks for just one day a fortnight, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. York House opened after a taxpayer-funded PS9.6 million refurbishment in 2019, with Windsor and Maidenhead Council claiming it would allow for a 'significant' customer-facing office, including a residents' services hub for visitors to discuss issues in person with the 300 staff members based there. But three years on, the council's flexible working policy has left the building empty, with residents dealing with lengthy waits on the telephone and an unreliable online complaints system. A visit on Friday by The Mail on Sunday found the building largely deserted and the dedicated council worker car parking spaces nearby all empty. A council source said: 'When the opportunity arose to let out the ground floor at York House, the reception was closed based on its low usage. That decision was taken prior to the pandemic.'",
  "fa4149fbdc94ce848e6f317e918ed2cdea17f32b9daa12ec7a535a46": "Vladimir Putin may be forced to give up control of the war in Ukraine for days as he is set for cancer surgery, a 'Kremlin insider' has claimed. The Russian dictator will reportedly nominate hardline Security Council head and ex-FSB chief Nikolai Patrushev to take control of the invasion while he is under the knife. Shadowy Patrushev, 70, is seen as a key architect of the war strategy so far - and the man who convinced Putin that Kyiv is awash with neo-Nazis. The extraordinary claims appeared on popular Telegram channel General SVR, which says its source is a well-placed figure in the Kremlin.  General SVR reported that Putin has abdominal cancer and Parkinson's 18 months ago. He has reportedly delayed surgery, which will now not take place before the Victory Day commemoration of Russia's World War Two victory in Red Square on May 9.   The news comes amid speculation Putin will launch an all-out war across Ukraine and order mass mobilisation of military-age men, a considerable political risk. The surgery had been scheduled for the second half of April but was delayed, SVR claimed. 'Putin was recommended to undergo surgery, the date of which is being discussed and agreed,' the outlet stated. 'There seems to be no particular urgency, but it cannot be delayed either.' It went on: 'The Russian President Vladimir Putin has oncology, and the latest problems identified during [his latest] examination are associated with this disease.' He also suffers from 'Parkinson's disease and schizoaffective disorder', which carries symptoms of schizophrenia including hallucinations and mania. The Kremlin has always strongly denied Putin has medical problems and portrays he is in robust health, even as he has been mysteriously absent in recent years. In a video detailing the General SVR claims, the outlet's source - supposedly an anonymous former high-ranking Kremlin military figure - said: 'Putin has discussed that he will be undergoing medical procedures. 'Doctors insist that he needs an operation, but the date has not yet been determined.' The source went on: 'I don't know for exactly how long [he will be incapacitated after the surgery]... 'I think it'll be for a short time.' Putin was 'unlikely to agree to transfer power' but was ready to put in place a 'charge d'affaires' to control Russia and the war effort. They continued: 'So, while Putin has the operation and comes to his senses...likely two or three days...the actual control of the country passes only to [Nikolai] Patrushev.' Such a move would be surprising since under the constitution, power should pass solely to the prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin. The 56-year-old is a low-profile technocrat without known military or secret service links. The outlet said the choice of spymaster Patrushev - which came after a two-hour 'heart to heart' with Putin - was the 'worst option'. 'What if, all of a sudden, Putin manifests particularly severe health problems? 'It was possible to contain it for some time, but now the course of the disease is progressing. 'I do not want to voice any forecasts now, so as not to reassure you once again, because in this situation you should not be very hopeful.' In another post, the outlet said: 'We know that Putin made it clear to Patrushev that he considers him almost the only truly trusted person and friend in the system of power. 'Further, the president promised that in case of a sharp deterioration of his (Putin's) health, the actual management of the country would be transferred, temporarily, to Patrushev.' The latest post on the suspected medical problems said: 'Putin's doctors insist on the need for him to undergo surgery in the near future. 'And although Putin did not give his consent in principle and the date of the operation was not agreed, he hurried to explain himself and get Patrushev's reaction and agreement.' Earlier it claimed Putin had been 'prescribed new drugs' from the West and given heavier doses. 'According to our information, one of the new medicines recommended by doctors after oral administration caused side effects in Putin in the form of severe dizziness and weakness,' said a post earlier this month. 'The doctor who recommended this medicine has been removed from the treatment process and is being tested. 'The drug itself, which was imported from one unfriendly state, is also being tested.' Recent investigative reports by exiled Russian journalists have suggested Putin has thyroid cancer, and indicated he is constantly surrounded by a team of top doctors. Attention has focused recently on his behaviour to control a seeming involuntary shake in his hand - renewing speculation of Parkinson's first highlighted in 2020 by General SVR. At a meeting with Defence minister Sergei Shoigu, he was seen firmly gripping a desk. The channel said: 'Many drew attention to the sickly appearance of the president, his puffy, swollen face and hands tightly clasped around the table top. 'There is nothing surprising here. 'Putin's health has recently deteriorated, we have already written about this, and the president's unhealthy appearance only confirms this. 'For more than a month, the attending physicians have not been able to convince Putin to change the drugs that suppress the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, since the old ones no longer give the desired effect, and the president is simply afraid to experiment with new ones. 'Clinging to the table with his hands is a way to hide a small but quite noticeable tremor.' The channel has been linked to Professor Valery Solovey, 61, who in February, was held for a seven hour interrogation apparently possibly linked to the regular claims about Putin's supposed medical and mental condition . Solovoy was a professor at Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) - attended by future top diplomats and spies. Amid rumours about his poor health, a video showing Vladimir Putin's shaking hand as he greeted Belarus's leader resurfaced earlier this month. The clip, which was filmed just before Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, showed him gripping a chair and pressing his hand to his chest to stop it shaking as he greeted Alexander Lukashenko. It fueled further speculation of the state of his health after footage and images appeared to show his bloated face and slouching posture. But the scenes of Putin's apparent struggles are reminiscent of a clip that showed Adolf Hitler's own failing health as Germany faced total defeat in the Second World war. In what was one of the last times the dictator was seen alive outside of his Berlin bunker, a propaganda video filmed in April 1945 showed him decorating members of the Hitler Youth who had been called up to defend Berlin. The film was supposed to show how Hitler was still in command, even as the Soviet Union's troops closed on the capital. But a telling part of the footage was cut from the final version and was supposed to have been destroyed. The clip, which was discovered in an East German film laboratory in the 1970s, showed the Nazi leader's left hand shaking violently as he held it behind his back while greeting military officers during the same trip outside his bunker. Many historians and experts believe that Hitler was suffering from Parkinson's disease at the time the video was filmed. The condition hampers muscle control and impairs mobility. British historian Richard Evans previously told how Hitler began to show symptoms of Parkinson's disease earlier in the war. He told the Smithsonian Channel in 2014 that symptoms of shaking in his left hand were 'for a time' cured after he was injured by the bomb that went off in the 1944 attempt on his life. 'He had a shake in his left hand and for a time that was cured as it were by the bomb that went off on July 20, 1944. 'As he said, that's not the way I would choose of curing it. But soon after that, the shaking came back in his right side. 'He began to drag his feet and shuffle. He began to speak in a more flat, less animated sort of way. Normally.' Comparisons of footage filmed in 1940 and 1944 showed how Hitler's mobility had appeared to decline during the course of the war. Surviving records show how Hitler's personal doctor Theodor Morell first noted Hitler's tremor in 1941 but put it down to stress. Then, in the final days of the war, he concluded that Hitler was suffering from 'shaking palsy' - the original name for Parkinson's disease. As well as impairing thought processes, Parkinson's can impair posture and muscle control. Hitler killed himself inside his bunker, which was built near Berlin's Reich Chancellery, on April 30, 1945. The mass murderer took his own life alongside his wife Eva Braun, who he had married the day before. By then, Germany was on the brink of total defeat against Allied and Russian forces. The Nazi dictator had launched a doomed invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 which saw Joseph Stalin's forces fight back and ultimately triumph against German troops. Earlier this month human rights officials claimed that, just like in Nazi Germany, the Kremlin has resorted to recruiting children to boost its troop numbers in eastern Ukraine. Moscow was said to be recruiting from youth clubs and conscripting 16-year-olds to replace the estimated 30,000 soldiers either killed, wounded or captured so far in the war. So-called 'patriotic clubs' sprang up in Russian-occupied parts of eastern Ukraine following its invasion in 2014 as part of a campaign to promote the country's culture in Luhansk and Donetsk. The Ukrainian parliament commissioner on human rights Lyudmyla Denisova said: 'The occupation authorities [of Luhansk and Donetsk] are conducting the mobilisation of children who participated in the so-called patriotic clubs, to the levels of illegal weapons formations. 'They have been doing military training and there have been deaths among these teenagers [in Ukraine]. 'Now they are promoting the entry into the army of civilians, including children in the temporarily occupied territories. 'In doing so, the Russian Federation has violated the laws and customs of war provided by the 1949 Geneva Convention on the protection of civilians... and the rights of children. 'The recruitment of children is a violation of international law.'",
  "250c87854a39c5931f31acd507108ca3b5c3499ab33df5a67d942283": "'Crazy' NHS bureaucracy is preventing doctors from prescribing hormone replacement therapies (HRT) that could immediately help thousands of menopausal women, it was claimed last night. The manufacturer of Bijuve, a substitute for Oestrogel for which there is a chronic shortage, say they have pallets of supplies gathering dust in a warehouse but cannot ship them out due to red tape. Tina Backhouse, of Theramex, which makes Bijuve, said the crisis could be eased within days if drug approval rules were streamlined. 'It really could be a quick win,' she said. 'Frankly, this red-tape nightmare could be solved by the end of the week.' Around a million women in the UK take HRT in patches, pills or gel form to replace hormones lost during the menopause. Supply issues have left tens of thousands struggling to access products, particularly Oestrogel. Last week The Mail on Sunday combined forces with our sister paper, the Daily Mail, to launch our Fix The HRT Crisis campaign. Bijuve is an alternative and has been approved by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, yet is available only in three areas - Somerset, Norfolk and Oxford - because around 150 NHS hospital trusts and almost 130 NHS clinical commissioning groups have yet to sign it off. Theramex representatives will meet with Health Secretary Sajid Javid and the new HRT tsar Madelaine McTernan on Thursday. While Bijuve is not suitable for all women currently prescribed Oestrogel, both are 'body identical' forms of HRT, meaning they are practically identical to the human sex hormones they are replacing. Some 30,000 women rely on Oestrogel and Ms Backhouse said Theramex 'definitely has the capacity' to step in. 'Twelve months ago we increased our production and our stocks are very good,' she said. Describing the system as 'crazy', she added: 'It would be better for there to be a national formulary [for HRT medicines] with experts giving recommendations on what should be on the list. That would cut out the local bureaucracy.' Dr Paula Briggs, chair-elect of the British Menopause Society, said the current system of local sign-off was 'massively' delaying the use of new therapies. Demand for HRT in Britain has risen in recent years, in part due to celebrities talking about their own menopause. TV presenter Davina McCall created the so-called 'Davina effect' by heralding the benefits of HRT, and Lisa Snowdon, who speaks about her campaign to help women in today's You magazine, have done much to raise awareness. MADELAINE McTERNAN: I shall leave no stone unturned to end the UK's HRT shortage By Madelaine Mcternan For The Mail On Sunday Two years ago, none of us could have imagined the phenomenal impact vaccines might have in leading our way out of the worst public health emergency for generations. Bringing together expertise from across the private sector, academia and government meant Britain was the first country in the world to roll out the Oxford University/AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines. Thanks to the monumental efforts of the NHS and volunteers, we have deployed more than 140 million doses of vaccine across the UK that have become our best defence against Covid. As Director General of the Vaccine Taskforce, I am immensely proud of what we achieved together on this national mission. We have overcome many obstacles and learned lessons from the pandemic, systematically working through issues to find and implement the right solutions. I am also proud of the key role that female leaders have played in the pandemic response. Now is the time to extend those successes to another challenge facing the UK - Hormone Replacement Therapy supply. Menopause is a natural part of ageing but for some women it can have serious and debilitating effects that can impact their work, family life and mental health. I am very pleased the discussion on this topic is opening up and more women are aware of, and accessing, products to help them manage these sometimes-distressing symptoms. While most HRT products are widely available, there are various challenges facing the availability of some products, meaning that some women have been struggling to access the medication they need. Over the past week, I have read the human stories about how a supply shortage can leave women in a desperate state and about the rationing of their supply of HRT. This is terrible, and I want to reassure women across the country that I will do everything I can to ensure they can have reliable access to HRT. Some of the challenges stem from rising demand. There has been a 38 per cent increase in the number of HRT prescription items over the past seven years. This is, of course, positive and we need to work across the system to ensure the supply chain can support demand. We want to make sure HRT supply not only matches demand now, but matches growing demand in the future. The Government is already taking action. On Friday, in order to even out distribution and make sure that women can access the medication they need, three Serious Shortage Protocols were issued to limit dispensing of three HRT products to three months' supply. This is a step in the right direction. The Vaccine Taskforce works closely with suppliers and has done so throughout the Covid pandemic. I will be taking the same approach in this role - working closely with HRT suppliers to understand where their constraints are and what can be done to address them. I understand why women are worried. We are listening to your concerns and we are leaving no stone unturned to ensure you can access the medication you need. DAVINA McCALL: It's time for husbands, brothers and sons to join us... and bring an end to the HRT crisis By Davina Mccall For The Mail On Sunday Recently I heard a story about a lady I will call Natalie, who was in her late 40s when she was hit by depression and anxiety so profound that she was confined to her bed for a month. She didn't have the energy even to get up and make a cup of tea. As a result, she lost everything -her fiance left her, she was fired from her job and she had to leave her home because she could no longer afford to maintain it. Her friends and immediate family were so frightened for her that they would not allow her to be on her own, anxious that history might repeat itself, as Natalie's mother had taken her own life at the age of 45. You might wonder what on earth could have plunged Natalie into such despair? For some of you it may be a shock to read it was the menopause, although others among you who have battled its debilitating symptoms - or watched others do so - may not be so surprised. Natalie's story is only one of many that I have read on websites and in the WhatsApp messages with which I have been inundated since speaking out about my own menopause in last year's documentary and on my social media. Many pierce my heart, like the Scottish woman I interview for my new documentary that airs tomorrow, who told the heart-breaking story of the moment she was in a car and wondered what to drive into to kill herself. These stories aren't uncommon - and it's borne out by statistics. It's no coincidence that the highest rate of suicide among women is between the ages of 45 and 55 - the time when women go through this life-changing transition. Other symptoms, which can last for years, include hot flushes; night sweats; migraines; palpitations; dry mouth, eyes, skin and vagina; brain fog and aching joints. Again the statistics make clear that these symptoms can affect quality of life to the extent that some women leave their jobs and their relationships fail. The good news is that treatment is available in the form of HRT, which can help manage all symptoms, replenishing vital hormones that your body has lost. HRT also plays an active part in disease management, massively reducing your risk of dementia, motor neurone diseases, Parkinson's and MS, as well as reducing your risk of heart disease, Type 2 diabetes and osteoporosis. It's not an exaggeration to say that for many women it's transformative. It was for me when I started taking it seven years ago, and it was for Natalie, who - after finally being persuaded to see her doctor - was immediately placed on a high dose of HRT and who is now able to face the world again. Many other women will testify to its miraculous qualities. If it's available that is. We've all read the news reports about women bartering their diminishing supplies over the internet, or trying to buy them from unknown - and very often untrustworthy - suppliers abroad on the black market. I would urge women not to do it, but it's an indicator of how desperate they are to get their hands on HRT treatment. Many women are nothing short of terrified at being without it and I don't think it is being melodramatic to say this is a crisis. Nor is it the first time this has happened: there have been on-and-off shortages of HRT for years, and it's not been uncommon in the past for women to turn to the private sector, paying through the nose for something which should be available from their doctor for a quarter of the price. Today, though, the situation has got so bad that even being prepared to pay for HRT doesn't guarantee women will get it. I can't imagine the same apparent torpor being shown by the authorities if this were another form of medication. Can you imagine the outcry if there was a shortage of insulin? It would be all hands to the pump, and rightly so. Yet only a relatively small percentage are diabetic, but the menopause happens to 52 per cent of the population. That's more than half of us, potentially facing a crisis at some point. Of course, not everyone has a terrible time. Menopause is different for everyone, and some women sail through with barely a hot flush or flash of temper. Lucky them! I certainly wasn't one of those. I started with symptoms around ten years ago after suffering brain fog and anxiety to the extent I thought I was losing my mind. In my mid-40s, I was considered by my doctor to be too young to be menopausal, so I took the decision to consult a gynaecologist. They put me on HRT patches which give me much needed oestrogen - the hormone whose rapid depletion in menopause causes so many of our problems - and a coil which gives me progesterone by way of balance. I felt better almost instantly and have been vocal ever since about the fact that I intend to take HRT until the day I die. But I also know I was lucky: too many women are going to their GPs and getting diagnosed with depression even though guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) say that if a woman over 45 is presenting as depressed or anxious then they should be offered HRT. Instead many doctors are routinely giving out anti-depressants, which don't work, and are simply a waste of time and money. It's one of so many injustices in this country, where it can sometimes feel that, when it comes to the health system, women are second-class citizens. It's hard to see it any differently when you learn that in Scotland, doctors prescribe the oral tablet form of HRT, a synthetic version that is linked - although only fractionally so - to a slightly incrementally higher risk of breast cancer compared with the bio-identical hormone gel, patch or spray. The reason? Expense of course: it costs PS18 more per year per person to provide the gel. Around the country, different regions are offering different types of HRT - a postcode lottery that is nothing short of a scandal. There is some evidence, too, that there is a divide running along wealth lines, with more affluent areas getting better access to a wider range of HRT options. It's one reason I've decided to use my platform in the public eye to campaign for change. It's a campaign I would urge everyone to join - including our sons, brothers and husbands. I don't see this as a feminist issue, it's an everyone issue. All those women going through the menopause have families, or work colleagues or friends. It may not be their bodies but it is still their problem. The best thing you can do if you want to make noise is join us on menopausemandate.com because we are going to empower ourselves to make a change. That means young women too. They may not be able to imagine it now, but they will all be menopausal one day. Happily, there is hope. Many brave female MPs have talked in Parliament about their own experiences, while the wondrous ball of energy that is Carolyn Harris MP, is proving to be an absolute juggernaut in driving for change - putting the menopause at the forefront of the government agenda. I am pleased to see that it is viewed as a cross-party issue, one on which everyone can agree. I also welcome the appointment of Madelaine McTernan as 'HRT Tsar'. Her success with the pioneering Vaccines Taskforce - on which she played a leading role - bodes well. We know there's a problem. Now we need a solution, and quickly. The first port of call is talking to the companies who supply HRT, to find out what is happening in the supply chain, how those problems can be ironed out, and what strategies can be put in place to make sure this never happens again. It is unsustainable. And it is destroying lives. Davina McCall: Sex, Mind And The Menopause is on Channel 4 tomorrow at 9pm.",
  "42838abe69a17a57bd8db7e4a625e9f7cface68ef03d8844b97b44eb": "Hospitals are still banning patients from having bedside visitors in 'immoral' Covid restrictions.  Last night, MPs, patient groups and campaigners criticised the postcode lottery that means some frail patients are still denied the support of loved ones.  Nine trusts continue to impose total bans on any visitors for some patients, The Mail on Sunday has found.  Almost half of trusts maintain policies so strict that they flaunt NHS England's guidance that patients should be allowed at least two visitors a day.  Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust and Royal Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust are among those continuing total bans on visiting for some of their patients.  University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (UCLH) has even been imposing its draconian restrictions on disabled patients who need special help for their care - only allowing visits on three days a week for a maximum of an hour each time.  Dozens of other trusts only allow one visitor to visit once a day for up to one hour - despite NHS England guidance on March 8 saying two visitors should be allowed for 'at least one hour per day and ideally for longer'.  NHS infection prevention guidance, updated on April 14, reiterated this by stating: 'Visits from [a] patient's relatives and/or carers should be encouraged and supported.' Hospital bosses are maintaining the restrictions despite plunging Covid cases.  New reported infections have plummeted since mid-March, from about 87,000 a day to fewer than 20,000.  Over the past month, Covid-related hospital admissions have almost halved, from 2,400 a day to 1,400. Of 125 hospital trusts in England publishing clear visitor policies online, only 66 are meeting the new guidance.  Fifty allow only one visitor a day - and in many cases they say this must be the same individual for the patient's entire stay.  Nine are still banning visits for most patients, although several said they intended to restart visits in the coming days.  MPs have attacked the restrictions as 'inhumane'.  Former Conservative Party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said he met a man yesterday who was denied any chance of visiting his wife in hospital when she fell ill. The woman, in her 50s, died alone.  Sir Iain said: 'It's just shocking - an example of just how heartless this process is.'  The most restrictive trusts are in parts of London, the West Midlands and Norfolk.  Sandwell and West Birmingham only allows visitors on certain wards and just one visitor for up to 30 minutes a day.  The Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic and District Hospital NHS Trust, in Shropshire, does not allow any visitors on some wards.  Shrewbury and Telford bans visitors except for 'compassionate' and 'exceptional' circumstances. It said from Tuesday that all patients can have one visitor for an hour a day.  Sir Iain said: 'People need to see their loved ones. There is no reason why they can't.'  Tory MP Alicia Kearns said: 'It is utterly unforgivable and immoral. There is no scientific evidence for any remaining inhumane restrictions on visiting. Trusts are breaching the rights of families.  'Visitors save lives, they advocate and calm their loved ones. When will this madness end?'  Lou Flynn has been desperate to visit her mother in hospital in Birmingham but says she has been banned. 'We are so gutted we cannot see her,' she said.  After being approached by the MoS, UCLH said it plans to allow 'daily visiting for every patient' but declined to specify how long for or for how many visitors.  An NHS spokesman said: 'In line with the latest guidance, NHS Trusts should facilitate patient visits and measures should already be in place for this to be done safely.'",
  "bdcae2bb5f0a2b7fde47d6d66aa63200eb62a4c17dfdc148b8c959fe": "The Queen's appearance on the balcony at Buckingham Palace to mark the finale of her Platinum Jubilee celebrations is 'by no means guaranteed', a well-placed source has told The Mail on Sunday. It was hoped the Queen might appear on the iconic balcony beside other members of her family, but that now looks in doubt due to the 96-year-old's restricted mobility. Aides are busy devising a 'plan B'. An insider said: 'It could still happen but it is by no means guaranteed that we will see the Queen on the balcony during the Jubilee.' Appearances on the famous balcony, which overlooks The Mall, has been a focal point for historic Royal occasions. Royal newlyweds have appeared there to share a kiss for the crowds below and the Royal Family traditionally gathers on the balcony to wave after the annual Trooping the Colour parade. Every jubilee year of the Queen's reign has also featured a balcony moment, when various members of her family come together to watch an RAF flypast.  But courtiers fear that the tradition may come to an end in June. The warning comes just days after plans for the Jubilee People's Pageant on Sunday, June 5 were released. It will culminate in a 'national tribute' led by the singer Ed Sheeran. The first recorded balcony appearance came when Queen Victoria stepped out to greet the public during celebrations for the opening of the Great Exhibition in 1851.  For the Golden Jubilee in 2002, Brian May, guitarist with the band Queen, performed the national anthem from the Palace roof.  A decade later, the Diamond Jubilee featured a slimmed down Monarchy on the balcony comprising the Queen, the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry.  Some members of the Royal Family were reportedly dismayed at being excluded. A source said: 'One aide had a call from the Duke of York demanding to be reinstated and another from the Wessexes, who were clearly smarting at being excluded.' Now there are more difficult decisions, including whether to feature the balcony moment at all if the Queen is unable to be present. Prince Andrew is highly unlikely to appear given his departure from public life after the settlement of a civil court case in America over allegations of sexual abuse, which he vehemently denies. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex also stepped down from their Royal roles, which would seem to automatically exclude them from playing an official part in the Platinum Jubilee to celebrate the Queen's 70 years on the throne, though Prince Harry has indicated that he may return to Britain with his family for the celebrations.  The Queen is yet to meet her great-granddaughter, ten-month-old Lilibet. During the recent Invictus Games in the Netherlands, Harry told a US television network: 'I don't know yet.  There's lots of things with security issues and everything else. So, this is what I'm trying to do, trying to make it possible that I can get my kids to meet her.' But a non-appearance on the balcony by the Queen would solve one problem by putting an end to family squabbles over who ought to stand alongside her. Andrew is said to be jostling for involvement in the jubilee and is expected to continue to attend family gatherings. But questions are being asked over what constitutes an official jubilee engagement.",

A staggering 500,000 food parcels have been bought in an PS8 million joint project between the Mail Force charity and the Ukrainian Embassy in London. Readers have pledged PS11 million to our Ukrainian refugee appeal, which was kickstarted by a PS500,000 donation from the Mail's parent company DMGT at the request of Lord Rothermere, chairman of the Daily Mail and General Trust, and Lady Rothermere. The MoS watched last week as a train carrying the first shipment made its way east. Russia has targeted Ukraine's rail network, so we are not revealing exactly where the boxes are. More than 186,000 food boxes have already been packed in Leicester and in excess of 70 lorry loads of food have arrived at a secure depot in central Poland where they are loaded onto trains. Each box contains 12,000 calories of food, enough to feed someone for a week. It is hoped that they will be delivered to civilians in the Donetsk and Luhansk areas of eastern Ukraine, now the focus of the war. Among those running short of supplies is Roman, 42, who is living in the basement beneath a block of flats in the shelled city of Severodonetsk. He has stayed because his elderly parents and frail grandmother refused to flee. 'We all live in the basement, because shooting by Russians never stops,' he said. 'The situation with food is close to critical. From time to time volunteers manage to squeeze in some humanitarian aid, risking their lives because it's extremely dangerous, but our part of the city is so hard to access that it happens very rarely. 'There is no bread in the city, and hasn't been for a long while. No matter how much money you want to give for it, it simply isn't there.' Water is also scarce. 'When it rains, we rush out even if there's shelling and fill buckets with rain water,' he said. 'Earlier we could get water from a nearby lake, but it's too dangerous to get to it now. 'Usually we manage to eat once a day. We cook porridge on the fire, and deliver it to grandmothers who can't walk.' Russia has been accused of targeting aid workers bringing food supplies to civilians. Food distribution centres have been bombed and two British aid workers, Paul Urey and Dylan Healy, were taken hostage by Russian forces last week. 'This is one of the shameful aims pursued by the Russian Federation,' said Pavlo Kyrylenko, governor of the Donetsk region. Svetlana Popova, press secretary of Luhansk regional administration, said: 'The situation with food is difficult all around the region, there are towns and villages where the situation is a full-scale humanitarian catastrophe.'

From today, tens of thousands of British expats are banned from using their UK driving licence on Spanish roads after the two governments failed to reach a post-Brexit agreement. The change does not apply to holidaymakers, who can still use their UK driving licence. Last night Whitehall sources blamed Spanish bureaucrats for delaying talks and missing the April 30 deadline.  Until now, Britons living in Spain have been able to use their DVLA-issued licences. Every other European country has agreed a post-Brexit deal. Tory MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith criticised the Spanish authorities, saying: 'It's a case of 'Manana, manana [tomorrow, tomorrow]'. It's time they pull their finger out and do what they agreed.' A UK Government source said: 'This could go on for a week or it could be longer. It should be temporary but we don't know how temporary. In the meantime, British residents living in Spanish hill villages won't be able to drive a car.' A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'An agreement to swap UK driving licences for Spanish licences has not yet been reached. 'From May 1, UK licence holders who have been resident in Spain for more than six months and did not exchange their licence during the transition period will no longer be able to drive legally in Spain. We have agreed to rapidly accelerate talks and are urging the Spanish Government to bring forward interim measures.' Until a deal is struck, UK expats will need to obtain a Spanish driving licence before getting back on the road. Malaga-based Sam Britton-Beese said: 'It's ridiculous. Our application for residency was still in process before the deadline so we couldn't register to exchange.' Linda Rogers, originally from Coventry, said: 'Our house is in the mountains and nothing is close by - I've tried to get into a driving school but nothing is available.' The DGT, the Spanish equivalent of the DVLA, and Spain's ministry of interior, were approached for comment last night. lHolidaymakers on all-inclusive packages are being restricted to six alcoholic drinks a day at hotels in parts of Ibiza and Majorca. Under new rules announced earlier this year in a bid to reduce anti-social behaviour, only three tipples are allowed at lunch and three at dinner, with guests having to pay extra if they want more.",
  "e41deb3aeb59602a524751f79488113b228f6438419b6cc47a840082": "'Assassins come with smiles, when you're at your weakest and most in need,' so said Henry Hill, the turncoat mobster in Goodfellas. And on Tuesday, nowhere was a more dangerous group of smiling assassins than those gathered in Downing Street at the invitation of the boss of bosses. Boris Johnson was hosting a legal - and booze-free - shindig in honour of all Tory MPs who have served 25 years in Parliament. The guests arrived for afternoon tea with pearly whites on display and knives behind their backs. Among them, Sir Graham Brady, keeper of the letters of no confidence in the PM. Also in this so-called Class of 1997 was Theresa May, who's well used to hostile environments and has given Johnson both barrels over Partygate, lockdowns and the Rwanda deportation plan. But there was no mention of the many elephants in the room. 'It was all very English - a genteel affair,' said one MP present. The reason? All these Tory grandees are waiting the results of Thursday's local elections before making clear where their loyalties lie - no doubt at the same time as sending Boris a thank you for a most pleasant party. Meanwhile, Tory MPs are nervous about the Metropolitan Police's verdict on the party held in the Downing Street flat during lockdown when Abba songs blared after Dominic Cummings' departure. It risks being BoJo's Waterloo. For the PM denied to Parliament that a party had been held, as he also told backbenchers on the 1922 Committee who had specifically asked him to confirm it was a 'work event'. Allies of Boris have since said he was only in the flat to conduct a job interview with Henry Newman, a Tory adviser and friend of his wife Carrie. However, sources tell me that Boris has privately given a different account of why he and some No 10 staffers were in the flat after the departure of Cummings and his colleague Lee Cain. It went like this: 'You've got to understand, we'd just lost Dom and Lee. We didn't know who we could trust. So some of us went up to the flat to work out what to do next - for a council of war.' Naturally, every council of war should be accompanied by the sound of Abba's 'Can you hear the drums, Fernando?'. Porngate... a job for 'Better Call Paul' Scully? 'Do you feel doomed? Have opponents of freedom wrongly intimidated you? Maybe they've said you're in serious trouble and there's nothing you can do about it. I'm here to tell you, they're wrong... No charge is too big for me. I'll give you the defence you deserve. Better Call Saul.' This ad for shifty US lawyer Saul Goodman's spin-off from the US drama Breaking Bad has been compared to how Tory MP Paul Scully is wheeled out as a human shield whenever the proverbial hits the fan. Whether the issue is non-doms, PPE or Partygate, the Small Business Minister appears on the airwaves taking one for Team Boris. Now mischievous colleagues shared this mocked-up advert ahead of Thursday's local elections. But surely even Saul Goodman would draw the line at defending Neil 'Porn' Parish MP. Allegra Stratton, whose career as the Tory Government's mouthpiece ended in tears when she was caught on video laughing about Downing Street lockdown parties, is about to be hired as a columnist by the New York-based media giant Bloomberg, I hear. We look forward to more classic Allegra tips, such as her infamous advice that, to help combat global warming, we should not rinse plates before putting them in the dishwasher.",
  "1da6eba56adcb4b3ecbad6eb22ea1bb63fedbf93def134df5d0066af": "A violent criminal has escaped deportation to Iran by claiming he faces persecution for having himself tattooed with Christian symbols. The 43-year-old Iranian asylum seeker was jailed for 18 months for assault in 2012 and ordered to leave Britain the following year, but fought his removal by claiming to have converted to Christianity. Even though a judge rejected the claim and said the former convict was not 'a credible witness', the Iranian was given leave to appeal in 2019. The Home Office rejected the appeal, but was unaware of tattoos all over both his arms. Now immigration tribunal judge Paul Doyle has ruled that, regardless of the man's faith and whether he had himself tattooed 'cynically', the Christian imagery put him at risk of being detained on arrival in Iran, so he must remain in the UK. Judge Doyle accepted the man would be able to associate with people in Iran without coming to harm and that there was 'not a real risk that he would come to the adverse attention of the Iranian authorities' after entering the country, but he would be at risk while passing through Tehran airport. The Home Office agreed that on his return to Iran he would be asked by airport officials 'to roll up his sleeves and bare his arms', and the Christian tattoos made him likely to be detained for 'further questioning'. The asylum seeker, whose identity is protected by a court order, arrived in the UK in 2008. He was refused asylum, but continued to live in Britain until he was convicted of the assault in Glasgow. In a ruling in March, Judge Doyle said: 'The appellant's tattoos are extensive. All of the surface of each arm is covered in ink. The tattoos extend across the backs of his hands and to his knuckles. 'Perhaps the appellant cynically had Christian iconography tattooed on his arms. The reason does not matter. It is the existence of the tattoos which raises a real risk of persecution because of the treatment the appellant will receive at the airport in Tehran.' About 800,000 Christians live in Iran, where they risk arrest, detention and persecution for their beliefs. Tory MP Tim Loughton, who sits on the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said: 'This is madness and makes a complete mockery of the legal system. Anybody can go to a tattoo parlour and pay a few quid to have a symbol which magically exempts them from deportation.' Alp Mehmet, chairman of the Migration Watch think-tank, said: 'The judge is entitled to his opinion, but this case suggests he has been taken in. The public would be justified in feeling uneasy about what appears a perverse decision that flies in the face of common sense.' There were 48,540 asylum applications last year, the most since 2003, with just 28 per cent of cases refused. The Home Office did not respond to a request for comment.",
  "d8aaf95aedc2eff697c612c6badeb8db8b05919611b13386b2b4c3fe": "More than 40,000 Britons in need of a new heart valve are missing out on a life-saving procedure even though it has been available on the NHS for more than 15 years. The ailing patients suffering with aortic valve stenosis, when one of the crucial valves in the heart narrows and reduces blood flow around the body, have been deemed too old or frail to survive conventional open-heart surgery. However, a far safer and less invasive keyhole treatment - but one which is also more expensive - is rarely being offered to them. The Mail on Sunday has discovered that only 7,000 of these procedures, called transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), are taking place every year, according to NHS data.  Charities say patients stuck on waiting lists are dying due to the backlog, which they claim is because of NHS chiefs' refusal to allocate more funds to the procedure. Aortic valve stenosis is usually caused by a build-up of calcium - a mineral found in the blood - on the heart valve.  This increases naturally with age in most people, but smoking, high blood pressure and obesity can accelerate it.  If left untreated, aortic valve stenosis, which affects more than 300,000 Britons, can lead to a number of serious conditions, including heart failure. For the majority of patients, replacing the faulty valve is the only effective option, and in the past this has been done by open-heart surgery - a major operation where a deep incision is made in the chest to reach the heart. While this procedure is almost always safe and effective, there are risks of potentially fatal complications from the general anaesthetic, infection or heart failure during the operation.  Patients can also take several weeks or even months to fully recover. For these reasons, aortic valve stenosis patients who are judged too old or frail are told they cannot have open-heart surgery. According to a study by the University of Notre Dame in Australia, which looked at UK healthcare data, more than 50,000 Britons fall into this category. TAVI, first performed on the NHS in 2007, requires only a small incision, often in the groin. A catheter is inserted and threaded up to the heart.  This tube carries an artificial valve made of animal heart tissue - usually from a cow or pig - around a deflated balloon. When the catheter reaches the faulty part, the balloon is inflated, expanding the artificial valve until it is locked in place. The technique has been shown in multiple studies to be both safe and highly effective. Patients on average spend far less time recovering in hospital than those who undergo open-heart surgery, and are less likely to experience complications. But those who need the operation aren't getting it, experts warn. 'The bottom line is there's an under-provision of TAVI on the NHS and it's costing lives,' says Dr Daniel Blackman, a cardiologist at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. 'Sadly, patients across the country die waiting for the procedure every month.' Dr Blackman, who runs a TAVI clinic in Leeds and teaches other doctors how to carry out the procedure, says the problem is that hospitals have limited resources.  'We do three days a week of TAVI and we could do four or even five,' he says. 'We need extra resources, such as more hospital space and more funding. Almost all centres which offer TAVI are in the same position.' Heart charities claim that hospital chiefs are reluctant to allocate more funding to the procedure because it is more expensive than open-heart surgery. 'Hospital managers are looking at the cost of the device itself, rather than the implicit costs,' says Wil Woan, chief executive of the charity Heart Valve Voice.  'Yes, it is more expensive than open-heart surgery, but that's not taking into account the money ultimately saved by keeping these patients out of hospital, not to mention the fact that TAVI patients spend less time on the ward recovering, which frees up crucial bed space.' Patient John Morrison died aged 69 after waiting two years for a TAVI. The Gaelic football coach from County Armagh was diagnosed with aortic valve stenosis in 2016.  According to his daughter, Kate Haffey, 43, doctors initially told him there was nothing to fear. Because John had undergone a quadruple bypass 20 years earlier, doctors ruled that open-heart surgery was too risky. Instead, he was told he would get a TAVI. 'The doctors said he could avoid an invasive procedure if he got TAVI and this would mean he'd recover quickly,' says Kate. But by 2018, John still did not have a date for the procedure, and his health began to deteriorate. 'His breathing got so bad he could barely walk,' says mother-of-three Kate, a special needs worker. 'We kept ringing his consultant saying we were worried, but they still couldn't say when he'd get his operation.' Kate says the hospital told her father there was no space on the ward for him. However, in the 50 days before his death in February 2019, he was admitted to hospital five times with heart problems. Kate says: 'The week before he died, his consultant said he was going on holiday and that when he got back Dad might get his TAVI.' A post-mortem examination found John died of arrhythmia - an abnormality of the heart's rhythm - caused by aortic valve stenosis. Kate says: 'Dad died knowing that one procedure was all that it would have taken to save him, and he didn't get it.' Both plaque and tartar will contribute towards tooth decay if left untreated. Plaque is essentially a sticky collection of bacteria that forms a film on the teeth.  Over time, the bacteria interact with food we eat to produce acids, which destroys enamel and leads to gum disease. Tartar, also known as calculus, is what happens when plaque builds up so much that it hardens and turns yellow, speeding up the development of gum disease. The substance is so tough that it can be removed only by a dentist. Plaque, however, can be washed away with regular brushing and visits to a dental hygienist.",

I was also treated for breast cancer ten years ago, and have had no recurrence. My hospital consultant has told me that I need a second Covid booster - it'll be my fourth jab - and that while waiting, I should isolate, to be on the safe side. My GP, however, says I don't need another jab yet and I don't need to worry. Who do I believe? Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, the rules and regulations have been made at a high level within the Department of Health or NHS England, and GPs are merely implementing their instructions.  This is the case when we offer people vaccinations and when we offer treatment for Covid, as we can now, for instance. Computer searches alert us to who is or isn't eligible for these things. The same process was used for shielding advice. If a patient's records contained details of a condition that put them at high risk, they were automatically sent a letter, texts or emails advising them to isolate. Along with all over-75s, anyone who is considered severely immunosuppressed should be eligible for a second booster, at least three months on from their last dose.  This would include people having treatments for rheumatoid arthritis known as biologics, or steroids, both of which suppress the immune system. Hospital consultants who oversee this kind of treatment are supposed to write to the GP on behalf of their patient and let them know the situation.  But this doesn't always happen. It means that GP records may not be fully up to date with the correct keywords that should instigate the vaccination invitation. Usually, in each surgery there is someone within the administrative team who would look into this, and it would be worth trying to speak to them. Another option would be to call 119, where advice is available on specific vaccination options. I went through the menopause at least ten years ago without taking HRT. I'm now 61. Would it be beneficial for me to start taking it now, to give my bones some protection? No one has to go on HRT - some types of which are in short supply at the moment. The choice to take medication depends on what a woman wants, and her symptoms. HRT can be prescribed at any age from the perimenopause on, with no upper age limit. It is used to control problems such as hot flushes, vaginal dryness and the mental health changes associated with the menopause. It is also used to protect against the bone-thinning disease osteoporosis, particularly in women who have had an early menopause. Oestrogen helps to maintain bone strength and density and prevent fractures. There are many factors that can raise the risk of osteoporosis, including being a low weight, smoking, alcoholism and use of steroid medicines. Having a mother who has had a hip fracture or osteoporosis also raises the risk. Doctors can determine whether bone protection is needed using a DEXA bone scan, which looks at the hip bones and spine to diagnose osteoporosis or the stage before it, known as osteopenia. If a problem is seen, we have specific medications. For milder issues we would use calcium and Vitamin D supplements. Weight-bearing exercise such as dancing or walking is important to protect bones for post-menopausal women, too. I'm waiting to have my gallbladder removed due to gallstones. The hospital cancelled my surgery appointments twice, and then I caught Covid and had to cancel. The hospital says I have to wait seven weeks before it will even book me back in, and then it'll probably be weeks or even months before the op. I'm in so much discomfort that I can barely eat. What can I do? Many of my patients are waiting for operations at the moment.  Covid has caused a backlog, and now it's just delay upon delay with no end in sight.

Dr Ellie can only answer in a general context and cannot respond to individual cases, or give personal replies. If you have a health concern, always consult your own GP. Gallstones are solid lumps of cholesterol that can form in the gallbladder - a little pouch within the liver which contains bile, a substance that helps digest fats. The stones can cause the gallbladder to become inflamed, or they can get stuck in the small tube exiting the gallbladder known as the bile duct, causing tremendous pain. They can also trigger infections requiring hospitalisation. If gallstones are a persistent problem, the gallbladder has to be removed.  This can be done with keyhole surgery and it's usually very successful. But some people don't want an operation and instead try to control their symptoms by losing weight and maintaining a low-fat diet.  Both these measures prevent gallstones from forming. Avoiding fat means that bile is not needed for digestion, and it basically helps to give the gallbladder a rest. Fasting should be avoided for anyone with gallstones, since it is known to make the situation worse. Pain relief, while waiting for the op, is also important. Your GP should be able to offer something quite strong. What goes up must come down.  But when it comes to Covid rates, there are many in the science community who seem interested in making noise only when the former is happening. Infections are continuing on their downward trend, having peaked in late March.  This fall began prior to schools closing for Easter and has been sustained. And before you say it's just because we're not testing, the figures are being taken from the Infection Survey reported by the Office for National Statistics, so not affected by people swabbing in the community. Hospitalisations and deaths, which were mercifully small, have been falling too. There were apocalyptic warnings when the last Covid restrictions were dropped, but it looks as if it was the right call. It's funny how those same voices of doom are silent now that things are going well. It's almost as if some people don't want the pandemic to end. Pet medicines aren't for humans A couple of weeks ago I warned readers not to swap HRT prescriptions with other women, after I read stories about some doing this because of the current shortages. But now I've discovered something even more worrying: people taking medication which is intended for their pets.  I even received a baffling letter from a reader asking whether she could take a drug designed for horses to treat her chest infection. The answer is absolutely not - it is incredibly dangerous. Even if a medicine for animals is also used for humans, it will be in a different formulation and dose.  And, most importantly, the exact compound will not have been tested on humans to check for potential side effects. If you're ever in doubt about medication, please visit a local pharmacist or ask your GP for advice.",
  "ad2130adb8d6cd85e8c071932d6b24ad1740aeac2d7996fb1914c21b": "Dramatic footage has emerged of the moment a pair of Russian tanks suffered a direct hit from bombs stealthily dropped from a Ukrainian drone. Expertly flown by an operator believed to be from Ukraine's 503rd Naval Infantry Battalion, the drone swooped above two Russian infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) at an estimated height of around 400ft, before letting loose its payload. Five seconds later, the anti-armour grenades detonated and engulfed the IFVs in a pair of huge fireballs. Ukraine's armed forces have used drones to great effect amid the Russian invasion, expertly conducting small-scale airstrikes and using drone-mounted cameras to analyse Russian troop movements to prepare ambushes. It is unclear where the drone strike took place, though Radio Liberty reported in February that the 503rd Naval Infantry Battalion was deployed in the Donbas region of Donetsk, eastern Ukraine, where fighting has intensified amid a major Russian offensive. It comes as the Land Forces of Ukraine today reported an estimated 23,000 Russian soldiers have been killed thus far in just nine weeks of war. Russia is believed to have sustained heavy casualties in the eastern Donbas region, as Ukraine's armed forces continue their bitter defence of the Donetsk and Luhansk territories which have been partially occupied by Moscow-backed separatists since 2014. Russia's military leaders are pouring troops and equipment into the east of Ukraine in an attempt to force a bloody victory after they abandoned plans to blitz through Ukraine's north and seize Kyiv earlier in the war. Britain's ministry of defence today said Putin's troops in the east are still struggling to make ground despite the renewed support, citing poor tactics and the deployment of low-skilled troops as reasons for the slow progress. 'Shortcomings in Russian tactical coordination remain. A lack of unit-level skills and inconsistent air support have left Russia unable to fully leverage its combat mass, despite localised improvements,' the MoD tweeted. 'Russia hopes to rectify issues that have previously constrained its invasion by geographically concentrating combat power, shortening supply lines and simplifying command and control,' it said. Meanwhile, Ukraine's military continues to carry out attacks behind Russian lines to cut off vital supply routes, with a fuel dump in the Donetsk region catching fire today. Kyiv has not acknowledged carrying out any of the attacks - which have also hit railway bridges and ammo dumps - but is widely thought to be orchestrating them. Besides the 23,000 troops lost in battle, Russia has reportedly lost 986 tanks, 2418 armoured vehicles, 189 planes, 155 helicopters and 73 anti-aircraft missile units. However, Russia has continued its brutal bombardment of the southern port city of Mariupol, where a small battalion of Ukrainian fighters are attempting to evacuate desperate civilians from the Azovstal steel plant. Of the 450,000 people who lived in Mariupol prior to Russia's invasion of February 24, only around 100,000 remain in the bombed out ruins of the city. But Russia's attacks are now concentrated on the Soviet-era steel plant located close to the harbour - the only part of the city not under occupation - where a small contingent of between 1,000-2000 Ukrainian soldiers are staging a desperate holdout alongside roughly 1,000 civilians. Ukrainian soldiers hiding in the network of tunnels and rooms underneath the plant have repeatedly called for international aid and a safe passage for evacuation, saying the plant's residents are barely surviving on extremely limited food and water and that there are many injured soldiers and civilians suffering without proper medical attention.  U.N. humanitarian spokesman Saviano Abreu said the world organization was negotiating with authorities in Moscow and Kyiv to organise a ceasefire. 'There is, right now, ongoing, high-level engagements with all the governments, Russia and Ukraine, to make sure that you can save civilians and support the evacuation of civilians from the plant,' Abreu said today, but he could not provide details of the ongoing evacuation effort 'because of the complexity and fluidity of the operation.' Ukraine has blamed the failure of numerous previous evacuation attempts on continued Russian shelling. The ferocity of the fighting, and the plight of the civilians hiding in the Azovstal factory, has stunned the world, bringing Pentagon press secretary John Kirby to the verge of tears on Friday. 'It's hard to look at what [Putin] is doing in Ukraine, what his forces are doing in Ukraine, and think that any ethical, moral individual could justify that,' Kirby, a retired rear admiral, told reporters.  'It's difficult to look at some of the images and imagine that any well-thinking, serious, mature leader would do that. So, I can't talk to his psychology. But I think we can all speak to his depravity.' A vast underground network of tunnels and bunkers has provided civilians and fighters hiding in the steel plant with relative safety from airstrikes.  But the situation has grown more dire in recent days after the Russians dropped 'bunker busters' and other bombs on the plant, the city's mayor Vadym Boychenko said Friday. Women whose husbands are trapped in the plant with the Azov Regiment said they feared soldiers will be tortured and killed if they are left behind and captured.",
  "517d214a0fae898b5f9c1a0977e032a2bea84b641b99684b21aee34c": "A guide listing 37 different gender terms and sexual identities has been issued to police officers and staff to help them when dealing with members of the public. Norfolk Constabulary's document, 'The + in LGBT', explains current terminology alongside a picture of a 'gender bread person' - a play on gingerbread man. Critics called it a 'complete waste of taxpayers' money' last night. The guide, on the force's internal computer system, was obtained by The Mail on Sunday using a freedom of information request. Some of the terms relating to sexuality, such as 'questioning' or 'asexual', are self evident, but others will be new to most, such as gynosexual (someone who is attracted to feminine gender presentation) and grey asexual (a person who 'experiences attraction rarely'). Another lesser-known term is 'varioriented', which is described as 'when your sexual and romantic orientations do not target the same set of genders'. Similarly, a range of gender terms is also listed. It includes words used in everyday language, such as binary, but also less common terms such as 'neutrois', which is when someone 'identifies as agender, neither male nor female, and/or genderless', and 'maverique', which is used to explain a 'non-binary gender that exists outside of the orthodox social bounds of gender'. Force staff who are confused by any of the definitions are directed to the 'gender bread person' diagram, which includes a series of sliding scales that relate to gender identity, sexual orientation, gender expression and biological sex. Norfolk Police declined to say whether it had produced the guide itself or had obtained it from another organisation. Former Shadow Home Secretary Ann Widdecombe said: 'This is absolute madness and a complete waste of rate-payers' money.  Even if the force didn't produce the guide itself, it has still cost time and money to make it available to staff.' But human rights activist Peter Tatchell said: 'It is perfectly valid for the police to list these many different sexual and gender identities, but there should be no mandatory requirement for officers to use these terms, unless a member of the public requests them to do so.' Norfolk Police said: 'All officers and staff are required to undertake training around diversity and inclusivity, and additionally information will be circulated or published on the Constabulary's intranet pages.' PANSEXUAL:  Attracted to all genders and/or not concerned about gender when attracted to someone. BICURIOUS:  Open to experiment with other genders, but unsure of forming relationship with multiple genders. POLYSEXUAL  Attracted to many genders. Androsexual: Attracted to masculine gender presentation. Gynosexual: Attracted to feminine gender presentation. Demisexual: Experiencing sexual attraction after forming a strong emotional bond. Grey Asexual: Experiencing attraction rarely, on a very low scale. Heteronormative:  Belief that heterosexuality is the norm and that sex, gender, sexuality and gender roles all align. Varioriented: When your sexual and romantic orientations do not target same set of genders. Erasure: Ignoring the existence of genders and sexualities in the middle of the spectrum. GENDERFLUID: Having a fluctuating gender identity. AGENDER: Not identifying with any gender. BI-GENDER:  Identifying as two genders, (but not exclusively) male and female. POLYGENDER: When you identify with multiple genders at once. Neutrois: Identifying as neither male, female nor genderless. GENDER APATHETIC: Not caring about identifying as any gender. GREY GENDER: Having a weak gender identification of yourself. MAVERIQUE: Non-binary gender outside of orthodox social bounds of gender.",
  "4a93eb5a0b610c32963dd7dfcd266bbc4a2975b510946bbe7f7f6193": "The Duchess of Cornwall will appear in a special edition of Vogue magazine this summer to mark her 75th birthday. Camilla's photoshoot took place last week with a skeleton crew of magazine staff and palace aides, all sworn to secrecy. An insider said the session had been agreed after several meetings between the Duchess and Edward Enninful, the British Vogue editor-in-chief. The source said: 'Conversations have been ongoing for months so this has been in the pipeline for a long time. The timing has been carefully thought through and her 75th birthday felt like the appropriate time.' Camilla, who turns 75 on July 17, is expected to feature on the front cover of the fashion bible, which has also conducted an interview with her. The high-profile exposure will be seen as a major step towards establishing the Duchess as a future Queen Consort in the public consciousness.  The Queen, who has said that it is her 'sincere wish' that Camilla is known as such when Prince Charles ascends the throne, is thought to approve of the Vogue project. Another source said: 'It won't just be in the magazine but obviously very prominently displayed on the website, so lots of people will see this.' It is understood that the Duchess turned down the offer of flying in a team of celebrity stylists to help with the shoot. Her participation will be seen as a show of support for Ghanaian-born Mr Enninful, who has championed diversity during his five years at the helm of the magazine. Last year, he took on the role of global ambassador for the Prince's Trust, which was founded by Prince Charles in 1976. And last week, Mr Enninful hosted a gala event for the charity in New York, attended by supermodels Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell, the Hadid sisters and Karlie Kloss. The Camilla feature is set to be one of his most high-profile interviews yet and follows a long-established tradition of the Royal Family appearing in Vogue. The Queen made her first appearance in its pages in 1927 as a one-year-old on her mother's knee. Princess Diana, Princess Anne and the Duchess of Cambridge have all been cover stars, while the Duchess of Sussex guest-edited an edition of the magazine in 2019. April's edition of Vogue featured two different covers - one of which showed a 1957 portrait of the Queen taken by her future brother-in-law Antony Armstrong-Jones, later Lord Snowdon. Some of Vogue's most iconic covers over the decades have featured Royal women including... In his editor's letter for the edition, Edward Enninful wrote: 'When I received my OBE for services to diversity in fashion several years ago, I thought carefully about what the decision to accept it would mean. 'Ultimately, I saw an ancient institution that was setting about on a programme of change and if they had noticed and wanted to recognise my work as something worth spotlighting, given the fact my endeavours were all about spotlighting under-represented people too, then I felt comfortable - keen, even - to engage.' Camilla's Vogue appearance will place her more firmly than ever at the heart of public life, and many will see it as another step towards ensuring a smooth transition when Prince Charles becomes King. After careful consideration, she will appear in the magazine after the Queen's Platinum Jubilee weekend in June, so as not to overshadow the landmark celebrations. Earlier this year, the Queen publicly supported her daughter-in-law by issuing an extraordinary statement to mark the 70th anniversary of her accession to the throne. On the eve of the anniversary of the death of her father, King George VI, the Queen said: 'When, in the fullness of time, my son Charles becomes King, I know you will give him and his wife Camilla the same support that you have given me; and it is my sincere wish that, when that time comes, Camilla will be known as Queen Consort as she continues her own loyal service.' Both Vogue publisher Conde Nast and Clarence House declined to comment last night. No-fuss Duchess refuses to be used as a clothes horse  By ALEXANDRA SHULMAN, former Vogue editor  The Duchess of Cornwall has never seen herself as a fashion leader. But then, she's had no need.  As an attractive, confident woman, she has never used the latest trends to carve out an identity. Nor has she needed her clothes to attract men. That's not to say, however, that she doesn't have her own views - and her own specific style. I remember, as Vogue editor, commissioning Mario Testino to photograph Camilla and Charles for their first wedding anniversary in 2006. Camilla was adamant then that she did not want clothes provided for her, and brought in her own. There was no fuss, she just knew what she liked and what suited her - and did not want to undergo a Vogue transformation. I applaud her for that. It's hard to be in the public eye and not feel that you have to be some kind of clothes horse. She hasn't bowed to that pressure and tried to change herself. It's a look that's both polished, appealing and smart.  She loves the simple, pared-back clothes of Anna Valentine and the femininity of Edina Ronay, both small British brands. Like any self-respecting upper-class Englishwoman she loves her pearls. She has a good eye for colour, too. She knows a deep blue - like the Vivienne Westwood dress she wore to the London Palladium in 2013 - will bring out the colour of her eyes. She also tends towards icy colours - pale blues, pale pinks, blush tones and cream that work with her hair and complexion. She always gamely dresses the part, but I suspect she's happiest in informal country clothes.  The Barbour jacket, the Dubarry boots and a pair of corduroy trousers are far more Camilla's style than the glittering frocks. One of her greatest strengths is she's happy in her own skin. It's one of the things I suspect her husband admires most in her. Times have changed since her last Vogue photoshoot. We now know Camilla will be crowned Queen alongside Charles, a prospect which is no longer in the distant future. The stakes have also risen. There's far more scrutiny over what someone in that position wears - and her choices will also tell us something about how she will want to be seen as Queen. Will she stick with her own tried-and-tested wardrobe, or will we see a new version of the Duchess of Cornwall emerge? I suspect the former. She's walking a fine line between remaining true to herself, while realising she is poised to step into a more highly scrutinised role. Whatever the case, the choice will have been hers - and hers alone.",
  "c8f67c6b4199acfccb3cab7459c65d57aa1d2189168b0a91bf7da1e9": "Labour was last night accused of stitching up Boris Johnson by forging a secret pact with the Liberal Democrats to sway this week's local election results. Tory chairman Oliver Dowden claimed Sir Keir Starmer was standing down candidates 'in swathes of the country' where Lib Dem support is strong to avoid splitting the anti-Tory vote. And he alleges Sir Ed Davey's party has returned the favour where Labour is dominant elsewhere. In a letter to the Labour leader, which has been seen by The Mail on Sunday, Mr Dowden claimed that Sir Keir planned to 'deny the voters a proper democratic choice' on Thursday. His comments sparked a political storm, with both Opposition parties denying his accusations. If the alleged tactics are replicated at a General Election, it could see a return to the days of the Lib-Lab pacts of the 1970s. Tory strategists fear a drubbing in this week's polls, which come in the wake of months of damaging 'Partygate' headlines over alleged lockdown breaches at No 10. Many of Mr Johnson's enemies in the party have said that they are waiting until after the elections - and the conclusion of the Partygate investigations - before deciding whether to push for a vote of no confidence in Mr Johnson. Mr Johnson is also reeling from the fall-out from yesterday's resignation of Tory MP Neil Parish, who admitted he watched pornography twice in Parliament. Mr Parish, who has represented Tiverton and Honiton in Devon since 2010, said the first incident had been a 'moment of madness' after stumbling on the X-rated images by accident while searching for tractors online but landing on 'another website that had a very similar name'. Mr Parish, who was suspended by the Conservative Party on Friday over the allegations, had been under pressure to resign from senior party figures who feared that the case would further damage Tory chances in the elections. Mr Parish's resignation will trigger a by-election in his Devon constituency, which the Conservatives won with a 24,239 majority over Labour at the last election. A survey by former Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft, published in today's Mail on Sunday, has found that when voters are asked to choose between a Conservative Government headed by Mr Johnson and a Labour Government headed by Sir Keir, the Labour leader is backed by 57 per cent to Mr Johnson's 43 per cent. However, the research also concludes that Mr Johnson's political future could be ensured by the absence of an obvious Tory successor and Sir Keir's failure to make sufficient impact. Tory losses in Thursday's local elections would be compounded if Labour has indeed formed a secret 'Rainbow Alliance' with the Liberal Democrats to maximise their local advantages. In his letter to Sir Keir, Mr Dowden said: 'I note that in the South West, you are standing candidates in 61 per cent of seats compared to 97 per cent in 2018. And in the South East there is a similar pattern with Labour standing candidates in 88 per cent of seats compared to 99 per cent in 2018. 'In the North of England it appears that the Liberal Democrats are returning the favour. In the North East they are standing in just 56 per cent of seats, down from 78 per cent four years ago. Labour are, however, standing in 99 per cent of seats in the area. These shifts are far too substantial to be a mere coincidence... It now appears that your plans to deny the voters a proper democratic choice are coming to fruition.' Mr Dowden asks Sir Keir to explain 'when Labour and the Liberal Democrats agreed to this pact', whether 'party members and MPs in the affected regions [were] consulted about the pact' and finally: 'Why have you attempted to conceal this from the voters?' Mr Dowden stepped in after campaigners in the North East reported that 'Labour are pushing hard up here, but the Lib Dems are nowhere', while in the South West 'Labour have completely vanished'. An official said: 'It was pretty obvious what was going on - Labour and the Lib Dems had done some sort of deal'. Last night, a Labour spokesperson said: 'We are in the business of winning elections with Labour candidates driven by Labour values.' A party source added: 'There will be no deals and no pacts. Labour only wins power when we squeeze other progressive parties and win over Tories.' A Liberal Democrat source said: 'From porn to Partygate, the Tories have had a disastrous local elections campaign, so it's no surprise they've resorted to making things up. The Lib Dems are one seat away from taking Labour-controlled Hull and are fighting a full slate in places like Newcastle, Gateshead and Manchester. 'This is a concocted story by a party that is desperate to distract from their terrible record on the cost of living, crime and local health services.' ",
  "1a36030278a459ebba234939199da9c39dc89ed1778ceac37df61b15": "Way back in 1977, I became a Westminster wife when my husband won Grimsby for the Labour Party. He joined 649 other MPs, of whom just 23 were women. You'd never know it by the fit of the vapours consuming the House of Commons last week, but there's never been a better time to be a woman in politics. It's taken a long and bitter struggle. The big breakthrough came in 1997. Remember the photo of 101 female MPs surrounding a new Prime Minister? It showed a beaming Tony Blair at the centre of the female intake of his New Labour government. Inevitably, they were dubbed 'Blair's Babes' - never a phrase that these fiercely intelligent and highly driven women liked. Indeed, Blair's wife Cherie described the nickname as 'disparaging', saying it implied 'they were there to be looked at, not to do'. In truth, these 101 Labour stalwarts who'd fought so hard for power and recognition weren't going to let any nicknames or nonsense get in the way of their work. Today, 25 years on, Labour's Deputy Leader Angela Rayner would do well to summon up their collective spirit. She has found herself at the heart of a 'sexism' row triggered by comments she was reported to have made to colleagues on Parliament's terrace about the way she had tried to disarm Boris Johnson at Prime Minister's Questions. She was outraged by the report of her alleged comments in The Mail on Sunday, saying it was 'offensive and demeaning', adding: 'I stand accused of a ploy to distract the helpless PM, by being a woman, having legs and wearing clothes.' All week, Westminster and radio and TV phone-ins have been full of howls about 'sexism'. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle joined the chorus of virtue-signalling, saying the story was 'misogynistic and offensive'. Cue calls from Ms Rayner's Labour colleague Harriet Harman, the longest-serving female MP. She said, seemingly grudgingly, that while certain aspects of life for women have certainly improved since the early 1980s, there is still a very long way to go. Before the Speaker considers asking the editor of Vogue magazine to advise women MPs not to wear blouses that are too revealing, let me remind you that not only have we had two women Prime Ministers, but the current holders of the offices of Foreign Secretary, Home Secretary, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Leader of the House of Lords and Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport are all women. Next week, women, including me, will be celebrating the 25th anniversary of Blair's Election victory - one that saw the ratio of women in Parliament double overnight from nine to 18 per cent - 120 were elected largely because of Labour's all-women shortlists campaign. Today, the good news is that women MPs are much more widespread among all parties in the Commons. Women account for 35 per cent of all MPs and the numbers continue to rise steadily. Labour has more female members (104) than male (98). Indeed, Angela Rayner is the first woman MP for Ashton-under-Lyne since the Lancashire constituency was created in 1832. Women in politics have improved their position considerably in the past quarter of a century, and that improvement has slowly begun to spread through every field of life. There are more female managers, teachers, doctors, lawyers and businesswomen than ever before and there are more hard-working, sensible women in Parliament battling for their constituents. When I first started working with politicians at Westminster as a TV documentary-maker, the small number of female MPs bore huge pressures. Male members thought it was perfectly acceptable to interrupt their female colleagues mid-sentence. Parliament's door-keepers assumed most women were typists or visitors until otherwise explained, and Margaret Thatcher was the oft-quoted honourable exception to it all. I'm a big fan of Angela Rayner. When I wrote her biography for a book titled The Honourable Ladies (the first complete record of all female MPs), I felt she was one to watch. I don't mind at all if Angela and other women MPs on all sides of the House use any female tactics to get their way and improve their lot and that of women generally in Parliament. After all, we have put up with just a few hundred years of men using every trick in the book to keep us subservient. Why shouldn't we do whatever we can to improve equality and hammer out a fairer deal? Just one word of caution. Now that finer weather is on its way, some women MPs may dare to go bare-legged in the chamber. But it's not wise to discuss with male colleagues the tactics you may use to grab attention.",
  "a5aaf8887e3827f260a56c6fe49f14b16b224ad127ade3c8d5634bb2": "Within hours of our report about Angela Rayner being published, the Left's Twitter warriors were in battle mode on social media. Even though Ms Rayner was herself the original architect of the 'Basic Instinct' references, The Mail on Sunday was accused of sexism simply for reporting what she had told Tory MPs. In an incendiary Twitter thread, Labour's Deputy Leader sent her supporters on social media into paroxysms of indignation by declaring that 'Boris Johnson's cheerleaders have resorted to spreading desperate, perverted smears in their doomed attempts to save his skin'. Ms Rayner - who used a crude colloquialism when joking with MPs about 'Sharon Stone' moments in the Commons - thanked her supporters for 'making a stand in the name of decency against those who would further coarsen, cheapen and debase our politics'. By late morning, I was trending. A byline picture taken nearly two decades ago became the focus of the cyber-Colosseum; one charmer likened the dimple on my chin to a 'cat's a***hole', while Labour MP Diane Abbott said it was 'interesting' that I felt entitled 'to judge female MPs by their looks' - something I hadn't done. Other messages were more serious. One post detected a 'strong rapist energy' coming from me, while another went to the opposite extreme by suggesting that I was an 'incel' - an involuntary celibate. I also apparently had 'one of those Tory faces that you wouldn't ever get tired of dropping an anvil on'. Even fellow journalists - usually in favour of free expression - waded in. Former Evening Standard journalist Marie Le Conte said on a private Twitter account that was shared with me, that she 'would be willing to risk my career to call Glen Owen a c*** to his face'. One of her Twitter followers responded by saying people who encountered me should 'spit at the pig'. Tanya Gold, whom I briefly worked with in the late 1990s, falsely reported a misogynistic remark I was supposed to have made at the time. Broadcaster James O'Brien said I had 'kissed the ring' of the Prime Minister. By now, with outrage piling on outrage, Boris Johnson had been advised by No 10 aides to issue a statement in which he condemned 'the misogyny' directed at Ms Rayner - although unlike many of his colleagues, he was careful not to conflate the reported remarks with any suggestion that the MoS was itself sexist for publishing them. Opportunistic MPs scented a chance for virtue-signalling. Leading the charge was Tory MP Caroline Nokes who, despite appearing in the same day's MoS over the shortage of HRT drugs for women, next to an article by me highlighting the need for action, wrote to Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle calling for him to remove my parliamentary pass - effectively ending my career as a political reporter. The BBC leapt on the story with glee, while ignoring the growing evidence emerging that Ms Rayner and her leader Sir Keir Starmer had lied over their 'Beergate' breaches of lockdown rules in Durham. The Corporation was predictably joined by The Guardian. Both put the MoS at the centre of the story. More level-headed sections of the media started to push back against the hysteria. The Daily Telegraph wrote in a leader comment that it was 'extraordinary' that the story had 'been elevated into a cause celebre' at the time of the Ukrainian war, which 'is the biggest geo-political crisis in Europe since 1945'. It added: 'The anger of parliamentarians is also being directed at the messenger rather than the tawdry source of the claim... are newspapers now expected to tailor their reportage to the whims of what MPs consider appropriate?' Privately, I was bombarded with messages echoing that stance from across the political spectrum - a senior Labour source even approached me discreetly in Westminster and whispered: 'Solidarity.' By mentioning the standout achievement of Ms Rayner's career - that she has managed to break into the inner circle of Westminster's power elite despite leaving school at 16 without qualifications after becoming pregnant - I was apparently deterring other women from following in her footsteps. 'They talk about my background because I had a child when I was young as if to say I'm promiscuous, that was the insinuation. It was quite offensive for people of my background,' she told Lorraine Kelly on ITV. Unlike her previous appearance on the programme, when she wore a dress, she appeared in a trouser suit. 'I wanted to be defiant because I don't think women should be told how to dress but I didn't want to distract from the fact that it's not about my legs. I didn't want people at home thinking, 'Let's have a look at what her legs are like or how short her skirt is.'' In response to the uproar, Sir Lindsay invited me to meet him at the Commons with The Mail on Sunday's Editor, David Dillon. The fact that shortly after extending the invitation Sir Lindsay had described the article as 'misogynistic and offensive' suggested to Mr Dillon that Sir Lindsay had already passed judgment on the story: the invitation was rejected. Mr Dillon wrote to Sir Lindsay: 'The Mail on Sunday deplores sexism and misogyny in all its forms. However, journalists must be free to report what they are told by MPs about conversations which take place in the House of Commons, however unpalatable some may find them.' He added that the freedom of the Press would 'not last if journalists have to take instruction from officials of the House of Commons, however august they may be, on what they can report and not report'. When the article was being produced, I told Labour that the Tory MPs had described how Ms Rayner had relayed the story on the terrace, but a spokeswoman said it was 'categorically untrue' and 'made up', so those details were removed from the article. The frenzy started to abate as awareness began to grow at Westminster about the true circumstances surrounding the story. The Daily Mail unearthed a podcast from January in which Ms Rayner laughed about the Basic Instinct comparisons. Speaking to Matt Forde's The Political Party podcast, she volunteered the fact that her appearance at Prime Minister's Questions that month had drawn comparisons with Miss Stone, joking that it had sparked an internet meme of her crossing and uncrossing her legs. The interview came 18 days after the Mail's Amanda Platell had likened Ms Rayner to Miss Stone in her column without receiving a complaint. An investigation by Tory Chief Whip Chris Heaton-Harris last week found that three further Tory MPs, in addition to the one quoted anonymously in the MoS article, had heard Ms Rayner raise the 'Basic Instinct' comparison on the Commons terrace. So Ms Rayner was professing herself outraged by something she had laughed about before - and had herself helped to propagate. But don't expect the trolls to acknowledge that. The truth about the story Angela Rayner branded a desperate, perverted smear... SHE was the one who told it By Dan Hodges It's time for people to know the truth. On a chilly evening just after the turn of the year, in between the evening votes, about a dozen MPs gathered in the House of Commons for a cigarette break. Standing among them - positioned by the balustrade that sits opposite the large double doors leading out to Parliament's long Thameside terrace - was Angela Rayner. Labour's Deputy Leader was engaging in the usual light-hearted banter that MPs of all parties indulge in when they feel the political spotlight is off them. Then she began to share a joke about how she tries to distract Boris Johnson when they sit opposite one another at Prime Minister's Questions. According to one MP who was part of the group, 'she said, 'I like to do my Sharon Stone trick. I cross and uncross my legs and give him a flash of my ginger g******' [a vulgar and offensive colloquialism].' A second MP, who was with the gaggle, also recalled hearing her use the phrase. As Rayner was making the joke, another MP joined the group. She told me: 'I didn't hear the whole thing, but I remember hearing her say those words.' A fourth MP said: 'Angela was telling us how she distracts Boris.' They too confirmed the use of the vulgar colloquialism. So four MPs all heard Rayner use exactly the same words. In response to what everyone recognised was a racy but light-hearted aside, Rayner's colleagues laughed, and carried on smoking. Then they all went their separate ways. Last weekend, The Mail on Sunday recounted the incident, as told by one of the MPs who was present. At which point, the world went insane. A spokesman for Rayner insisted the report was 'categorically untrue'. Rayner posted a tweet in which she raged: 'Boris Johnson's cheerleaders have resorted to spreading desperate, perverted smears.' Johnson described the story as 'appalling sexist, misogynist tripe'. The Speaker of the House, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, condemned the article as 'misogynistic and offensive'. He then announced he was summoning the Editor of The Mail on Sunday to the Commons. BUT then something that is relatively unusual in our era of social-media-fuelled culture crusades occurred. The truth began to emerge. A recording of a podcast Rayner made earlier in the year with comedian Matt Forde revealed the terrace banter wasn't the only time she had joked about 'doing a Sharon Stone' at PMQs. Several MPs - a number of whom had been scared off by threats from their own Prime Minister to unleash 'the terrors of the Earth' on the story's original source - came forward to myself and other journalists to confirm she had made the comments. The Mail on Sunday politely rejected the Speaker's summons, and Sir Lindsay backed off. But the whole furore has revealed a number of important things about how our current political discourse is framed. Rayner's attempt to cover up her comments on the terrace was - on one level - understandable. I'm told she was genuinely embarrassed at the thought of them being made public. One colleague told me: 'She was honestly worried about the fact that her kids would get to see this.' But that instinctive, and human, reaction does not grant a licence for deception. Had Rayner responded to the story by deploying the same frankness and self-awareness she had displayed in her podcast, the whole uproar would have been avoided. Instead, she tried to leverage the moment by painting herself as a victim of Tory sexism and classism. And that represented a false deflection. In reality, Angela Rayner is one of the more popular Labour MPs in the eyes of her opponents. They like her directness and down-to-earth style. They enjoy the fact she's prepared to share a drink and a joke with them. Which is why many Conservatives were so surprised and angered when she made her notorious 'Tory scum' comment. Speaking on ITV's Lorraine, she claimed: 'They talk about my background because I had a child when I was young as if to say I'm promiscuous... It was quite offensive for people of my background.' But in her Forde podcast, she gave an honest, and more perceptive, assessment of how senior Tories engage with her. Responding to Forde's observation that the PM treats her with respect, she said Johnson recognises that 'if I start attacking her, I'll look really crap as a posh guy from a posh school so I'll just try and compliment her in a sort of backhand way', adding: 'I think that's how they try and sort of deal with me. Because they don't really know how to deal with me.' As Rayner's denials began to unravel, her defenders tried to change tack. The saga needed to be looked at in the wider context of the fight against Westminster's misogynistic culture, they said. A battle that needs to be fought. Last Sunday it was reported that three Cabinet Ministers and two Shadow Cabinet Ministers are among 56 MPs who have been referred to the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme over claims of sexual misconduct. And last night, MP Neil Parish resigned after admitting watching porn in the Commons chamber. So there is no need to confect outrage. The issues confronted by women MPs and staff of Parliament are all too real. And if people want to throw Rayner's comments into the midst of the wider conversation about Westminster culture, fine. But someone must then explain what the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party joking about distracting the Prime Minister by crossing and uncrossing her legs at him contributes to that debate. Because this is the key question. Do the facts and the truth still matter, even when they tell the wrong story? The tale Rayner and her allies want told is a simple one. A neanderthal Tory MP, motivated by class and gender hatred, concocted a comparison with 90s sex siren Sharon Stone, then used it to smear a working-class Labour MP. And it provides a compelling narrative. The single mother from a Stockport housing estate being targeted by - and fighting back against - the Etonian bully boys. But the problem with the truth is it can be fickle. It doesn't always come down on the side of the righteous. Or the self-righteous. And this is the truth of the whole saga. The story Angela Rayner branded 'a desperate, perverted smear' was actually a story told by Angela Rayner herself, about herself. The language the PM condemned as 'appalling, sexist, misogynist tripe' was Angela Rayner's language. The claim the Speaker condemned as 'misogynistic and offensive' was her own. Two weeks ago, as Tory whips desperately attempted to corral their MPs into blocking an inquiry by the Privileges Committee into whether the PM lied to the Commons over Partygate, Rayner tweeted: 'You want the truth? They can't handle the truth.' But after the events of the past seven days, a separate question must now be posed. Can she? It's taken a bitter fight but I believe there has never been a better time to be a woman in politics By Linda McDougall, author of Westminster Women Way back in 1977, I became a Westminster wife when my husband won Grimsby for the Labour Party. He joined 649 other MPs, of whom just 23 were women. You'd never know it by the fit of the vapours consuming the House of Commons last week, but there's never been a better time to be a woman in politics. It's taken a long and bitter struggle. The big breakthrough came in 1997. Remember the photo of 101 female MPs surrounding a new Prime Minister? It showed a beaming Tony Blair at the centre of the female intake of his New Labour government. Inevitably, they were dubbed 'Blair's Babes' - never a phrase that these fiercely intelligent and highly driven women liked. Indeed, Blair's wife Cherie described the nickname as 'disparaging', saying it implied 'they were there to be looked at, not to do'. In truth, these 101 Labour stalwarts who'd fought so hard for power and recognition weren't going to let any nicknames or nonsense get in the way of their work. Today, 25 years on, Labour's Deputy Leader Angela Rayner would do well to summon up their collective spirit. She has found herself at the heart of a 'sexism' row triggered by comments she was reported to have made to colleagues on Parliament's terrace about the way she had tried to disarm Boris Johnson at Prime Minister's Questions. She was outraged by the report of her alleged comments in The Mail on Sunday, saying it was 'offensive and demeaning', adding: 'I stand accused of a ploy to distract the helpless PM, by being a woman, having legs and wearing clothes.' All week, Westminster and radio and TV phone-ins have been full of howls about 'sexism'. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle joined the chorus of virtue-signalling, saying the story was 'misogynistic and offensive'. Cue calls from Ms Rayner's Labour colleague Harriet Harman, the longest-serving female MP. She said, seemingly grudgingly, that while certain aspects of life for women have certainly improved since the early 1980s, there is still a very long way to go. Before the Speaker considers asking the editor of Vogue magazine to advise women MPs not to wear blouses that are too revealing, let me remind you that not only have we had two women Prime Ministers, but the current holders of the offices of Foreign Secretary, Home Secretary, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Leader of the House of Lords and Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport are all women. Next week, women, including me, will be celebrating the 25th anniversary of Blair's Election victory - one that saw the ratio of women in Parliament double overnight from nine to 18 per cent - 120 were elected largely because of Labour's all-women shortlists campaign. Today, the good news is that women MPs are much more widespread among all parties in the Commons. Women account for 35 per cent of all MPs and the numbers continue to rise steadily. Labour has more female members (104) than male (98). Indeed, Angela Rayner is the first woman MP for Ashton-under-Lyne since the Lancashire constituency was created in 1832. Women in politics have improved their position considerably in the past quarter of a century, and that improvement has slowly begun to spread through every field of life. There are more female managers, teachers, doctors, lawyers and businesswomen than ever before and there are more hard-working, sensible women in Parliament battling for their constituents. When I first started working with politicians at Westminster as a TV documentary-maker, the small number of female MPs bore huge pressures. Male members thought it was perfectly acceptable to interrupt their female colleagues mid-sentence. Parliament's door-keepers assumed most women were typists or visitors until otherwise explained, and Margaret Thatcher was the oft-quoted honourable exception to it all. I'm a big fan of Angela Rayner. When I wrote her biography for a book titled The Honourable Ladies (the first complete record of all female MPs), I felt she was one to watch. I don't mind at all if Angela and other women MPs on all sides of the House use any female tactics to get their way and improve their lot and that of women generally in Parliament. After all, we have put up with just a few hundred years of men using every trick in the book to keep us subservient. Why shouldn't we do whatever we can to improve equality and hammer out a fairer deal? Just one word of caution. Now that finer weather is on its way, some women MPs may dare to go bare-legged in the chamber. But it's not wise to discuss with male colleagues the tactics you may use to grab attention.",

The 8,000-sample survey shows the Opposition ahead not just on traditional Labour issues such as the NHS and public services, but on supposedly Tory territory such as immigration and crime. When it comes to questions related to the premiership, Keir Starmer rates higher than Johnson in nearly all areas: communicating, leading a team, formulating effective policies, judgment in a crisis - and doing the job of Prime Minister overall. Apart from a willingness to take tough decisions for the long-term - a double-edged sword that can suggest callousness - the Conservatives lag behind Labour on all the qualities we asked about: unity, values, being 'on the side of people like me', having the right priorities and (disastrously for a centre-right party) competence. The Government's response to rocketing living costs has hardly helped. In our focus groups, a few wise souls always knew the lavish pandemic spending would have to be paid for and asked what any Minister could do in the face of global markets. But most of those who had noticed the March mini-Budget were unimpressed. Not only did the help on offer feel derisory in comparison to tax and price rises, but revelations about the non-dom status of the Chancellor's wife, the couple's combined wealth and his apparent inability to make a contactless payment reinforced the impression of a Government at one remove from real people's lives. And that is before Partygate. Just under half of voters - including most 2019 Tories - think the issue is trivial or the PM should be allowed to concentrate on more important things. But the 47 per cent who told us he should resign included nearly a third of those who switched to the Conservatives from Labour at the last election. Notably, in our groups it was often such first-time Tories who were angriest with Johnson. Having had the highest hopes for him, they were the most disappointed. They had regarded him as a maverick but not as a liar or lawbreaker. This episode showed him to be part of an elite that looked down on them, not - as they'd felt in 2019 - on their side against the Brexit-blocking establishment. All of which helps to explain why, forced to choose between the Johnson-led Conservatives and a Starmer-led Labour Government, my poll had the latter ahead by a 14-point margin. No wonder that so many believe Johnson is doomed, or that the Tories' chances at the next election depend on his departure. But from my research, I see three reasons why Boris and his party have a path to survival. First, though Partygate anger goes wide and, for some, deep, it is not clear it will be a dealbreaker. Often people would spend a good hour grumbling about Johnson and his party (and parties) and then say, usually with a sigh, that they would probably vote Tory again next time. Four in ten of those leaning towards the Tories said they thought Johnson was a rogue and a chancer but that wouldn't stop them voting for him. For some there was also a feeling that with Brexit, Covid and now Ukraine, he hadn't really had a chance to show what he could do - a remarkable sentiment after 12 years of Tory-led government. Second is the lack of an obvious successor, with no indication from our groups that any one figure had the potential to transform the party's standing. Some continued to see Johnson as appealing, regarding his staying power as a trait of leadership. Third, to put it kindly, Keir Starmer has yet to take the nation by storm. 'It's just 'we wouldn't have done that',' one borderline voter told us. 'Nothing to make me think 'this guy's got a plan'.' Some wondered if Labour had really changed and could be trusted, especially given Starmer's previous incarnation in the Corbyn Shadow Cabinet. For many, his apparent hedging on the question of what defines a woman said more about his fear of upsetting his party's radical wing than about the issue itself: 'He left it pretty wishy-washy, and I don't want a wishy-washy Prime Minister,' said one. All this suggests the poll numbers reflect a grumpiness with the status quo rather than a firm endorsement of the alternative. Recent events have brought Johnson's long-standing opponents into alliance with some of those who helped put him in No 10. His job is to persuade the latter that there is more that divides them from their new confederates than they have in common. Voters won't forget Partygate. The question is how many of them - given time, a proper apology and a renewed focus on other priorities - will forgive or at least disregard it. But time is just what his opponents don't want to give Boris Johnson. Full details of Lord Ashcroft's research are at LordAshcroftPolls.com.

  "3062434ab01454a615fc88f0ea13b9f7f7a14ae541479113a445f055": "Boris Johnson is trailing Keir Starmer as he faces a week of vital elections - but the absence of an obvious Tory successor could ensure his survival as leader. That is the conclusion of exclusive research by former Conservative Deputy Chairman Lord Ashcroft, published in today's Mail on Sunday. When asked to choose between a Conservative Government led by Boris Johnson and a Labour Government led by Sir Keir Starmer, 57 per cent of people backed Sir Keir, and 43 per cent backed Mr Johnson. But the 8,000-sample survey also picked up a 55 per cent approval rating for the Prime Minister's handling of the Ukrainian crisis, with just 25 per cent who disapprove. Despite the rows still raging about 'Partygate', the survey says the cost of living crisis is regarded as the most important issue facing the country, followed by the NHS, the economy, climate change and immigration. There is no question, however, that the Partygate allegations have damaged the Prime Minister, particularly among voters who switched to the Conservatives from Labour at the last Election - one third think he should resign over the issue. Among voters as a whole, 47 per cent think he should resign, while 30 per cent disapprove of his actions but think he should stay to concentrate on more important issues, and 15 per cent dismiss the stories as trivial. Lord Ashcroft concludes that there are three reasons why 'Boris and his party have a path to survival'. First, many of those who objected to Party-gate said it would not stop them voting Tory; second, there's the lack of a Tory rival with the potential to turn around the party's fortunes; and third, Sir Keir 'has yet to take the nation by storm'. The survey also found 'very little enthusiasm for Labour... even among those... highly critical of Johnson and the Conservatives. There were concerns that Labour could not be trusted with the public finances, and Starmer himself was widely thought to be criticising the Government without offering any constructive alternatives.' One focus group attendee said: 'He's a non-entity really. All he does is bitch about what everybody's doing wrong, but he's not telling us what he'll do.' Another said: 'There's no kind of solution coming out of his mouth.' But voters did praise the woman of the moment: Labour's Deputy Leader Angela Rayner. According to one participant: 'We need someone like Angela Rayner - comes from a mining village, was a carer for years. She's got that passion to try and make a difference.' Another commented: She doesn't seem like a politician. She just seems like the woman who lives across the street and goes on a rant and a rave.'

Jools Oliver said she was relieved when the pandemic meant that their eldest daughter Poppy did not have to take the traditional written exams. 'It's so wrong, education is so wrong,' said the mother of five. 'The only thing that was good that came out of coronavirus was my daughter didn't have to sit her A-levels. She did, but in a different way, a constructive way and it saved her.' She added: 'The stress of school is so unnecessary. I don't get school myself, I don't get how they teach, I don't understand the subjects they teach still. 'Jamie and I once wanted to open a school. Years ago, we had this idea, but obviously it's not possible. But it was a dream, the dream school - which I'm sure most parents would love - that fits your child completely but not so focused on the way it is now [with] this academic pressure, these pointless exams.' Speaking on her podcast Spinning Plates, the 47-year-old said school was tough for less bright youngsters. 'It's great if you're academically gifted, it's amazing. But if not, it's a bloody hard slog.' The Olivers have five children. As well as Poppy, 19, they have Daisy, 18, Petal, 12, Buddy, 11, and five-year-old River. The couple are no strangers to intervening in education. The 46-year-old TV chef met Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi earlier this year to campaign for better school meals following a rise in child obesity during the pandemic. In 2005, he sparked a national debate over school dinners when he exposed unhealthy food on the menus, including the serving of Turkey Twizzlers.",

  "e573f62955ce3ec8565a6c2643f2cdac6ff334605ba0354fb6d783de": "Postal workers are threatening to strike after Royal Mail tried to force them to work on Sundays. The 500-year-old company wants to ramp up weekend deliveries to compete with rivals such as Amazon and DPD. But it now faces a backlash from bosses at the Communication Workers Union (CWU), who filed an emergency motion at their annual conference last week warning that unless pay demands are met there could be a walkout of more than 115,000 staff as early as next month. At the moment, posties can volunteer to deliver parcels on Sundays - typically online purchases from large retailers. However, Royal Mail wants to modernise the service by expanding it to include deliveries for small businesses and shoppers. In return the firm is offering staff a two per cent pay rise backdated to April 1, and a further 1.5 per cent from the date when the changes are implemented. It is also offering a new 'above-and-beyond' bonus, worth up to two per cent, for staff who hit productivity targets. However, the CWU wants a 'no-strings' deal in line with inflation - which is currently seven per cent. Deputy general secretary Terry Pullinger said: 'We know what our members have done through the pandemic, we know they deserve a pay rise - one that rewards them for what they've done, but also protects them from this cost-of-living crisis. 'We are giving them one week, and if we're not in sight of a no-strings pay award we'll instigate the four-week resolution process at national level. 'They want to smash up this great public service and fill their pockets with gold. We have to fight with everything we've got.' Royal Mail chief executive Simon Thompson will hold talks with the CWU this week in a bid to avoid industrial action. The cost-of-living crisis, with soaring prices for energy, food and fuel, is expected to cut consumer spending on online purchases, which could hit parcel volumes. Royal Mail is also battling rising costs, such as fuel for its huge fleet of vehicles, and bosses have been considering sending more post between its sites by rail, which would also cut carbon emissions. It is required by law to deliver letters six days a week from Monday to Saturday, and parcels from Monday to Friday, to every address in the UK at a uniform price. Royal Mail said: 'We have been clear that we want to agree a deal as soon as possible to recognise the great work of our people, while ensuring that Royal Mail can grow and remain competitive into the future in a fast-changing industry.' Royal Mail piloted Sunday deliveries in 2014 but decided against introducing the service permanently. It then began Sunday deliveries again in March 2021 on a voluntary basis. It began a major review of its operations in February following a car-crash Christmas. Deliveries were seriously delayed across the UK, with some Christmas cards not arriving until mid-January. Post Office workers are due to stage a one-day strike on Tuesday in a separate CWU dispute over pay.",
  "53ba029dadc23b36166946083ac00c3760ccabebf798a6a25e026f5d": "It's time for people to know the truth. On a chilly evening just after the turn of the year, in between the evening votes, about a dozen MPs gathered in the House of Commons for a cigarette break. Standing among them - positioned by the balustrade that sits opposite the large double doors leading out to Parliament's long Thameside terrace - was Angela Rayner. Labour's Deputy Leader was engaging in the usual light-hearted banter that MPs of all parties indulge in when they feel the political spotlight is off them. Then she began to share a joke about how she tries to distract Boris Johnson when they sit opposite one another at Prime Minister's Questions. According to one MP who was part of the group, 'she said, 'I like to do my Sharon Stone trick. I cross and uncross my legs and give him a flash of my ginger g******' [a vulgar and offensive colloquialism].' A second MP, who was with the group, also recalled hearing her use the phrase. As Rayner was making the joke, another MP joined the group. She told me: 'I didn't hear the whole thing, but I remember hearing her say those words.' A fourth MP said: 'Angela was telling us how she distracts Boris.' They too confirmed the use of the vulgar colloquialism. So four MPs all heard Rayner use exactly the same words. In response to what everyone recognised was a racy but light-hearted aside, Rayner's colleagues laughed, and carried on smoking. Then they all went their separate ways. Last weekend, The Mail on Sunday recounted the incident, as told by one of the MPs who was present. At which point, the world went insane. A spokesman for Rayner insisted the report was 'categorically untrue'. Rayner posted a tweet in which she raged: 'Boris Johnson's cheerleaders have resorted to spreading desperate, perverted smears.' Johnson described the story as 'appalling sexist, misogynist tripe'. The Speaker of the House, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, condemned the article as 'misogynistic and offensive'. He then announced he was summoning the Editor of The Mail on Sunday to the Commons. BUT then something that is relatively unusual in our era of social-media-fuelled culture crusades occurred. The truth began to emerge. A recording of a podcast Rayner made earlier in the year with comedian Matt Forde revealed the terrace banter wasn't the only time she had joked about 'doing a Sharon Stone' at PMQs. Several MPs - a number of whom had been scared off by threats from their own Prime Minister to unleash 'the terrors of the Earth' on the story's original source - came forward to myself and other journalists to confirm she had made the comments. The Mail on Sunday politely rejected the Speaker's summons, and Sir Lindsay backed off. But the whole furore has revealed a number of important things about how our current political discourse is framed. Rayner's attempt to cover up her comments on the terrace was - on one level - understandable. I'm told she was genuinely embarrassed at the thought of them being made public. One colleague told me: 'She was honestly worried about the fact that her kids would get to see this.' But that instinctive, and human, reaction does not grant a licence for deception. Had Rayner responded to the story by deploying the same frankness and self-awareness she had displayed in her podcast, the whole uproar would have been avoided. Instead, she tried to leverage the moment by painting herself as a victim of Tory sexism and classism. And that represented a false deflection. In reality, Angela Rayner is one of the more popular Labour MPs in the eyes of her opponents. They like her directness and down-to-earth style. They enjoy the fact she's prepared to share a drink and a joke with them. Which is why many Conservatives were so surprised and angered when she made her notorious 'Tory scum' comment. Speaking on ITV's Lorraine, she claimed: 'They talk about my background because I had a child when I was young as if to say I'm promiscuous... It was quite offensive for people of my background.' But in her Forde podcast, she gave an honest, and more perceptive, assessment of how senior Tories engage with her. Responding to Forde's observation that the PM treats her with respect, she said Johnson recognises that 'if I start attacking her, I'll look really crap as a posh guy from a posh school so I'll just try and compliment her in a sort of backhand way', adding: 'I think that's how they try and sort of deal with me. Because they don't really know how to deal with me.' As Rayner's denials began to unravel, her defenders tried to change tack. The saga needed to be looked at in the wider context of the fight against Westminster's misogynistic culture, they said. A battle that needs to be fought. Last Sunday it was reported that three Cabinet Ministers and two Shadow Cabinet Ministers are among 56 MPs who have been referred to the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme over claims of sexual misconduct. And last night, MP Neil Parish resigned after admitting watching porn in the Commons chamber. So there is no need to confect outrage. The issues confronted by women MPs and staff of Parliament are all too real. And if people want to throw Rayner's comments into the midst of the wider conversation about Westminster culture, fine. But someone must then explain what the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party joking about distracting the Prime Minister by crossing and uncrossing her legs at him contributes to that debate. Because this is the key question. Do the facts and the truth still matter, even when they tell the wrong story? The tale Rayner and her allies want told is a simple one. A neanderthal Tory MP, motivated by class and gender hatred, concocted a comparison with 90s sex siren Sharon Stone, then used it to smear a working-class Labour MP. And it provides a compelling narrative. The single mother from a Stockport housing estate being targeted by - and fighting back against - the Etonian bully boys. But the problem with the truth is it can be fickle. It doesn't always come down on the side of the righteous. Or the self-righteous. And this is the truth of the whole saga. The story Angela Rayner branded 'a desperate, perverted smear' was actually a story told by Angela Rayner herself, about herself. The language the PM condemned as 'appalling, sexist, misogynist tripe' was Angela Rayner's language. The claim the Speaker condemned as 'misogynistic and offensive' was her own. Two weeks ago, as Tory whips desperately attempted to corral their MPs into blocking an inquiry by the Privileges Committee into whether the PM lied to the Commons over Partygate, Rayner tweeted: 'You want the truth? They can't handle the truth.' But after the events of the past seven days, a separate question must now be posed. Can she?",
  "8eff08e6b3aa74a3f0b22266c258e4329f266ed1e250083aa7dff26f": "The HRT shortage is causing panic among women worried about missing a dose or potentially a few weeks of supply. To them, I can offer a little optimism: it might not be as bad as you fear. Hormone replacement therapy has been a victim of its own success, helping so many more women alleviate the troublesome symptoms of the menopause that demand has outstripped supply. Undoubtedly, losing your access to the medication is no trivial matter if you've come to rely on it. For some years, I too used HRT. The little packets of gel I was prescribed weren't life changing but they did take the edge off the night sweats. However, after a breast cancer diagnosis last year I had to go cold turkey and ditch my HRT that same day. The outlook seemed bleak. I dreaded being flung into a hotbed of sweats, fatigue, memory loss, mood swings and weight gain. And, yes, I have experienced a small amount of all of those. But in the general scheme of things, it's survivable. It's not a Mariupol basement. I recognise everyone's experience of HRT will be different - and some women might not like what I have to say next. But I believe panic breeds panic. The power of suggestion is huge, particularly when it comes to health matters. And while I am certainly no menopause-denier, it's often the case that we are more likely to experience symptoms if we anticipate them. For example, I could assume it's menopausal memory loss that makes me lose my phone several times a day. But I prefer to think it's just me being a bit hopeless. My sleep pattern is worse than when I was younger, but that's typical for both sexes as we age. I constantly have to scan my brain for the right word, which is frustratingly out of reach. Is that really so different from before? I don't think so. But if I were convinced that all this was the result of being deprived of HRT, I would feel far more helpless and desperate about the loss. Sometimes mind over matter can work. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has appointed Madelaine McTernan as HRT tsar, following Kate Bingham's success as vaccine tsar during the pandemic (surely with the current Russia situation we need to find another term?). However, no matter how brilliant she may be, the supply chain isn't going to transform overnight. For women who experience utterly debilitating symptoms, the loss for even a short time of HRT can be appalling. But for those like myself, missing out for a few weeks is likely to be bearable. After all, many gynaecologists advise that it is fine - sometimes even useful - to skip doses of HRT to minimise the body's dependency on it. Panicking will only make it worse. Gosh, what is one meant to do with one's legs if crossing and uncrossing them is such a powerful weapon that Angela Rayner might employ it to throw Boris off his stride? Actually, plain leg-crossing is a bit sub-fusc. Real glamour pusses employ the double leg-cross, where one foot is hooked behind the other in a kind of double helix shape. This manoeuvre manages a) to demonstrate you have legs long and slim enough to achieve the position and b) locks you stylishly into the pose so that there is no possibility of unseemly leg uncrossing. Try it sometime. In the interest of taking a robust approach to soaring fuel prices I've tallied the amount of electrical appliances we own and they come to a staggering 28, not including lighting and heat. Apart from the usual washing machine, dryer, dishwasher, oven and TV there is an arsenal of kit, much of which simply didn't exist even a decade ago. Life without laptops and mobiles is now inconceivable and at present there are four of each in this house. Then there's the standard microwave, kettle and hairdryers. But we also have a Sonos music speaker, Sky box, useless soundbar, iPad, Airpods, electric vape, headphones... I could go on. To avoid spiralling costs, we're advised to turn everything off at source each night. But in this house there's scarcely a spare socket to be found. By the time they had all been put to bed it would be nearly morning. Why do we consider some things vulgar? I wonder this looking out of the window at the blue blossoms of the neighbour's ceanothus. To me they're vulgar. The colour jars in a way that my brilliant pink rhododendron doesn't. Nor do the scarlet and crimson geraniums that I love, but know others might consider vulgar. Is vulgarity in the eye of the beholder or is there a way of independently verifying it? Nicky Clarke, who has closed his London salon after a glorious 30 years, was the last of a certain genre of celebrity hairdressers. Nicky's original Mayfair salon was glitzy and plush with brown upholstery and plenty of gilt - a far remove from today's ubiquitous poured-concrete-and-stainless-steel look. He was usually late for the appointment - diva-style - arriving with his scissors in a whirl of leather trousers, Versace shirts and gloriously-tinted locks. And out and about on the party circuit he was photographed as frequently as his famous clients. Nowadays, our successful salon owners - the likes of Josh Wood, George Northwood and Daniel Hersheson - are more low-key, less showbiz. Their names are above the door but their faces remain relatively anonymous, even if their client lists are every bit as famous as Nicky's was. For anyone looking for a TV fix, I highly recommend Il Cacciotore (The Hunter) on All 4. The second series of this brilliant Italian Mafia drama has just landed and it not only has a gripping and true plot, but the most wonderful array of fabulous 1970s men's ties.",
  "dff939b79c608c6b7717a8c9aedc7c01637c92290df36794f5f310b0": "A Conservative Party inquiry into the 'Basic Instinct' furore over Angela Rayner has concluded that the Labour Deputy Leader was herself the source of the story. The report in last week's Mail on Sunday triggered a storm at Westminster, after Ms Rayner claimed that 'Boris Johnson's cheerleaders have resorted to spreading desperate, perverted smears in their doomed attempts to save his skin'. The uproar forced the Prime Minister to release a statement condemning the 'misogyny' which had been 'anonymously directed' at Ms Rayner, and to order his whips to try to identify the Tory MP quoted in the article. Mr Johnson also vowed that he would unleash 'the terrors of the Earth' on the person responsible. But within 24 hours of the investigation starting, the whips had spoken to four Tory MPs who testified that Ms Rayner had herself raised the issue with them during an evening on the Commons terrace. According to one of the MPs, she told them that during PMQs she liked 'to do my Sharon Stone trick. I cross and uncross my legs and give him a flash of my ginger g******'. A second MP also recalled the phrase. A third MP told the whips they hadn't heard the entire exchange, but had overheard the vulgar colloquialism, while a fourth said: 'Angela was telling us how she distracts Boris.' The investigation concluded that the exchanges had been lighthearted and good-natured. When this newspaper put the story to the Labour Party last weekend, a spokeswoman had insisted that the claims were 'categorically untrue'. The resulting row led to Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle condemning the article as 'unsubstantiated', 'misogynistic' and 'offensive', and inviting The Mail on Sunday's Editor, David Dillon, to a meeting at the Commons. The request was declined. After the row broke out last week, the Daily Mail revealed the contents of a podcast recorded in January in which Ms Rayner volunteered the fact that her appearance at PMQs that month had drawn comparisons with Miss Stone, and that it had sparked an internet meme of her crossing and uncrossing her legs. The interview came 18 days after the Daily Mail's Amanda Platell had likened Ms Rayner to Miss Stone in her column - without receiving a complaint. The revelations that Ms Rayner had herself propagated the story she was supposedly furious about led her supporters to try to reframe the row as an indictment of the 'sexist' and 'classist' culture at Westminster and in the media. A senior Tory source said: 'We soon realised that Rayner's story wasn't quite all it seemed.' A leader article in today's MoS calls on 'Britain's political and media classes' to 'relearn old rules such as the one which advises waiting for the facts before passing judgment, and that trial comes before verdict, and verdict before sentence'. It concludes: 'If they do not, and if they continue to allow themselves to be stampeded by social media mobs, then freedom of speech, freedom of the Press and democracy itself are in danger.'",
  "f7fe5c73271929819fe00d528a1bbbb10a32c56c62fef08f41b2c8a4": "Stargazers were enjoying a cosmic treat this weekend as two of the solar system's brightest planets appear close to colliding in the night sky. Venus and Jupiter are about 430 million miles apart, but viewed from Earth they appear to be almost touching in a rare celestial spectacle known as a planetary conjunction. The phenomenon happens every year as the planets orbit the sun, but this weekend the heavenly bodies appear much closer than usual. The same spectacle will not be repeated until 2039. If there is a clear sky, the naked eye or binoculars will be enough to see the planets just above the horizon in the east. Venus, the brightest of the duo, will appear just 0.2 degrees - less than the diameter of a full moon - south of Jupiter. The planets are most visible just before dawn in the coming weeks as they start to drift slowly apart. A conjunction is when two planets appear close together, or even touching, in the night sky. Venus and Jupiter have been slowly appearing to close on each other in recent days before meeting in their own conjunction. The best time to witness this was at 5am this morning, just before sunrise. The planets are now so bright that, if the skies are clear, they are plainly visible to the naked eye. Enthusiasts with telescopes can make out features of Jupiter or some of its largest moons. It is also possible to get a rare glimpse of Mars and Saturn in the same patch of sky, appearing to form a line of four planets. Jupiter, named after the king of the Roman gods, is the third brightest object in the night sky after the moon and Venus. It has been marvelled at since prehistoric times. Venus, which will remain visible before dawn until September, is the second planet from the Sun and is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. With the planets appearing low in the sky, stargazers who have yet to witness the spectacle are advised to find a high spot or an unrestricted view on a clear night to glimpse the dazzling duo. 'It's very exciting for astronomers and it's a really great opportunity for people to get out and have a look,' Professor Lucie Green, chief stargazer at the Society for Popular Astronomy, told the BBC. 'The planets will differ in their brightness. Venus is brighter than Jupiter so it will look dazzlingly bright when you see it. 'Jupiter will be slightly fainter, about one-sixth of the brightness of Venus,' she said.",
  "9ba64c2d03bed840a858ad0eec139680f760e5ce2c8a63c1951fb4aa": "Insomnia, crushing fatigue, palpitations, hot flushes, night sweats that drench the bed, not to mention problems with memory and concentration, anxiety and debilitating sexual discomfort... around 80 per cent of women suffer at least some of these symptoms - to name just a few of the most common - during menopause. And they can have a significant impact on everyday life, when many are juggling demanding jobs and a family. In the face of this, hormone replacement therapy can be a lifeline - drugs that are similar or identical to female hormones which help to alleviate many of the worst problems caused by the menopause. The devastating impact of the current HRT shortage cannot be underestimated.  One million women in the UK take the treatment, with prescriptions doubling over the past five years, as well as greater awareness about the benefits of the tablets, gels and patches. This has led to some pharmacists running out of certain types in recent months. The supply issue is most acute for one form of HRT, called oestrogel - and last week the Government's newly appointed HRT tsar Madelaine McTernan pledged that her first task would be to ensure 'reliable ongoing access to these critical medicines'. However, stories have emerged of women, unable to get their usual prescription, travelling huge distances to find a pharmacist with it in stock.  Some have turned to the black market, or are reportedly meeting in shopping-centre car parks to exchange medicines. Others will doubtless have begun to investigate the bewildering array of 'natural' alternatives to HRT - which, again, is a potential minefield.  According to experts, the reality is that most won't work: nothing can replace the oestrogen that HRT drugs provide except another form of HRT. Often, complementary and alternative treatments that purport to alleviate symptoms of the menopause are not proven to be safe or effective.  Herbal remedies are also not regulated by a medical authority in the same way that prescribed medicines are. So what can women do if they can't get hold of enough - or any - of their regular HRT? The answer is: a lot. For a start, there are types of HRT it might be possible to switch to which are in plentiful supply. And there are other drugs the GP can offer that can alleviate symptoms.  There are proven methods which don't involve medication that may help to make life more bearable. They might even provide a stop-gap or sticking plaster to tide you over until the shortages ease and health chiefs take steps to overcome the crisis. Tackling the menopause without HRT, if you need it, is never going to be easy.  But approaches such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and daily mindfulness practice may be able to help, just as they are known to help some chronic pain sufferers.  Exercise and diet tweaks can reap benefits, as can getting a separate duvet from your partner. In a bid to provide some definitive advice, we asked five leading health experts on the menopause - some of whom have been through it themselves - to give their tried-and-tested recommendations... TALK TO YOUR GP ABOUT TRYING DIFFERENT DRUGS  Dr Philippa Kaye, GP and women's health expert Since the current shortages aren't affecting all HRT treatments equally, if you are running out of one that is in short supply, the best thing to do is to simply switch to one that is available, according to GP Dr Philippa Kaye. She says GPs may be able to prescribe you an alternative version that is equally effective. For example, she advises women who usually take their HRT through their skin (known as transdermal treatment) but cannot get hold of their usual supply of oestrogel to ask their GP to prescribe an equivalent. These include Sandrena gel, transdermal patches - of which there are numerous brands - and Lenzetto spray.  Dr Kaye explains: 'You can say to your GP, I can't get oestrogel, can I please try something else? 'Or you could ask the chemist who is telling you that there's no oestrogel to explain what they have got instead. And then say to your GP: This is in stock, please can I have it?' If you are unable to get any kind of equivalent transdermal treatment, she suggests considering an alternative such as oral HRT. She recommends a Mirena coil if you are having problems getting the progesterone component of HRT. 'If you're in the perimenopause, the stage before the menopause when oestrogen begins to wane, and you are struggling with heavy bleeding during your period, it can help treat that. It also acts as a form of contraception.' Other equivalents are listed on the British Menopause Society website (thebms.org.uk). If you don't want to take HRT, or you can't for medical reasons, there are some other medicines available to you as well. 'HRT is not the only solution - it's part of the puzzle, not the only piece on the board,' says Dr Kaye. 'For many women, HRT is absolutely life-changing and even life-saving, but whenever I talk about HRT on social media, there will always be someone who says, 'No thanks, I just don't want to take it.' ' And in these cases, she says, if a woman is suffering and needs help, there are non-hormonal options available. For example, a medication called clonidine that is primarily used to treat high blood pressure is also licensed to treat hot flushes. Some antidepressants are commonly used too. 'They can help with mood and also with hot flushes,' says Dr Kaye. 'They seem to have an effect on the part of the brain involved in how hot we feel.' Another option is nerve pain drugs gabapentin or pregabalin. 'We offer them for migraines and other conditions, and they can reduce hot flushes and improve your mood, well-being, insomnia, sleep and aches and pains.'  But Dr Kaye adds: 'I wouldn't recommend these things simply because a woman can't get her normal type of HRT - because you can switch to another type. There will always be something.' If insomnia is a problem, she recommends Sleepio, a six-week online or app-based sleep improvement programme, based on cognitive behavioural therapy techniques.  'There's also Headspace, an app that teaches you how to practise mindfulness and meditate,' she adds. If night sweats are your biggest problem, she recommends doing as much as you can to keep yourself cool at night. 'You could have a fan on, or put a cooling pad into your pillow, or even freeze your pyjamas. 'You could also have two single duvets, so your partner could have one that's warmer than yours.' Dr Kaye acknowledges that such simple measures will never rival the effectiveness of taking HRT, but adds: 'I think lifestyle changes can make a difference.' The M Word: Everything You Need to Know about the Menopause by Dr Philippa Kaye, Vie, PS9.99. COGNITIVE BEHAVIOURAL THERAPY AND BREATHING Mariella Frostrup, broadcaster Mariella Frostrup describes herself as an 'HRT devotee', but says that there were additional approaches she came across while researching her book, Cracking the Menopause While Keeping Yourself Together, that in her opinion 'really do help'. One of these is cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), a form of psychotherapy that involves addressing 'problematic' thoughts and situations, and looking for new ways to look at and think about them. Mariella was initially sceptical that CBT treatments could work for symptoms of the menopause. She says: 'I thought it played to every kind of stereotype of the hysterical woman - this idea that you just breathe through it.' But then she witnessed a group of eight menopausal women taking part in CBT sessions while filming her BBC documentary The Truth About... The Menopause. She says: 'They had a really positive reaction. I think it was partly that they were talking about what they were going through, because many of them had actually been suffering in silence until that point, but also because, during the menopause, it's not just your body doing things that are unhelpful - it's your brain as well.' Finding a way to manage negative thinking, stress levels and night-time anxieties can be very beneficial for menopausal women, she believes now. 'CBT proved to be incredibly helpful for women having hot flushes. Just acknowledging that you know it is about stress, and if you just calm yourself and your heartbeat down, you can really help yourself.' About three-quarters of menopausal women suffer hot flushes. In one trial, women with breast cancer who'd undergone a medically induced menopause due to treatment were given one 90-minute session of CBT per week for six weeks.  They had all been suffering from at least ten episodes of severe hot flushes a week, and were given specific CBT techniques to help cope.  After the course, the women all reported being significantly less troubled by the symptom, and six months later they still reported benefits. Mariella says she has learned a technique when stressed of breathing in for five seconds and out for five seconds. She adds: 'I still do it in the middle of the night, if I wake up with one of those anxiety attacks. 'What you're trying to do is clear your brain. And it might not work straight away - it's not like popping a sleeping pill. But it's probably a lot better for you, and it does work, it really does. If you keep focusing and you keep doing the breathing, it helps.' She also sometimes listens to the Calm app, which aims to help users sleep, meditate and relax. 'I'll listen to a rainstorm, to help me go back to sleep. I find it works well in just distracting me and helping me to calm everything down.' It doesn't stop her waking up in the first place or experiencing anxiety, but it is useful. 'It just helps you manage it that bit better.' Studies also found that mindfulness therapy - techniques similar to meditation - can significantly reduce hot flushes and night sweats, irritability, depression and anxiety. There is also some evidence that yoga can help relieve the psychological symptoms of the menopause, and Mariella is a keen online participant of yoga classes. 'There's a preponderance of fitness stuff that you can do online now, and there are amazing yoga classes out there. I do one on a Wednesday and a Saturday, and I find that it really helps.' She points out that strengthening your bones and muscles through exercise or weight training is very important if you cannot access your usual supply of HRT, because the medication is known to be beneficial in preventing osteoporosis and heart disease. 'Yoga and weight training are really important for your bone density but also they keep you supple and calm,' she says. The other strategy she recommends is to get plenty of fresh air. 'I know it sounds really boring, and patronising even, but if you make sure you get a good hour's worth of fresh air every day - by going for a walk or a run, or doing some kind of exercise out in the open air - it has a hugely positive impact, certainly on mental health.' Since the menopause can have a negative effect on your mental health, engaging in any activity that improves it is a good idea.  And there is another advantage, too, she adds: 'It teaches you to give yourself a bit of a breather during your working day.' While going through the menopause, Mariella would walk every day. 'I do other forms of exercise, but that's the thing I can't live without - I have to go for a walk.' Evidence suggests that women with high and moderate physical activity levels have less severe menopausal symptoms compared with inactive women.  In one study, 80 women aged 40-65 who undertook a 12-week period of exercise training felt it had a positive impact on their vitality and mental health. Another of Mariella's tips is to ask for a fan in your workplace if you get hot flushes. She says: 'Don't be ashamed. It's just common decency in the workplace to make an environment that works for everyone.' She also stresses there isn't a shortage of vaginal oestrogen: 'Keeping the whole of that area lubricated and working properly is incredibly important. This is not about sex - you've got a lot of vital organs down there that need to be in a healthy state, and vaginal oestrogen keeps them in that state.' She would like to see vaginal oestrogen made available without a prescription. 'This is something that's so fundamentally important to women's lives. You should be able to walk into a chemist and buy it over the counter.  'And if you can't afford it, it should be available on prescription for free. If we want to consider ourselves a civilised, equal society, that is the benchmark.' Cracking the Menopause While Keeping Yourself Together by Mariella Frostrup and Alice Smellie, Pan Macmillan, PS9.99. By JO MacFARLANE for the Mail on Sunday  They are touted as safer and 'more natural' alternatives to conventional HRT.  Yet menopause specialists have warned women affected by the oestrogel supply crisis not to resort to buying so-called compound bioidentical HRT, which is sold by private clinics. Made from hormones extracted from plants, the products are marketed with claims they cause fewer side effects than the medicines dished out by NHS doctors - because the active compounds they contain closely match the body's own.  But while, in some cases, they contain similar ingredients to standard treatments, they are unlicensed because there is no evidence that they are safe or effective. Haitham Hamoda, chairman of the British Menopause Society, said: 'Women should stay away from these products. We have HRT products made from natural sources on the NHS, but these are made to strict manufacturing criteria which regulates things like dosage and purity. 'These compound bioidentical products are not the same - they're often made up in small pharmacies and not subject to the same controls, so you don't really know what you're getting.' GP and women's health expert Dr Philippa Kaye added that HRT offered on the NHS has been specifically designed to be exactly the same as the chemical structure of oestrogen and progesterone found in the body. Women should also be cautious if considering taking alternative supplements and herbal remedies, Dr Hamoda continued. Several, including black cohosh and St John's wort, and phytoestrogen supplements made from soy or red clover, are reputed to help ease symptoms.  But Dr Hamoda said scientific evidence is limited and that some have side effects and can interfere with other medication. There is some evidence that phytoestrogens, for example, which stimulate the body's oestrogen receptors, can ease symptoms in the short term.  But longer-term data isn't clear and supplements should not be taken by women with breast cancer as the rise in oestrogen may cause tumours to grow or return. St John's wort is another herbal supplement often recommended to ease symptoms of depression - and is said to relieve hot flushes. NICE concluded it may have a beneficial effect. 'But again, you need to be a bit cautious,' said Dr Hamoda, 'as it's a liver enzyme inducer, which means if you're taking other drugs, such as cancer drugs, they may not work as efficiently.' Black cohosh, a member of the buttercup family, is 'probably the most researched supplement' for menopause, he added.  One trial found the herb relieved symptoms more effectively than a placebo, and was as effective as HRT at controlling hot flushes. But it can cause stomach upsets and rashes, and Dr Hamoda said: 'Although there is some evidence of effect, it's the same logic that applies to all of these supplements - and others such as flaxseed, sage and evening primrose oil - that there's not enough of it to draw meaningful conclusions. 'With herbal remedies, the other problem is the quality, purity and ingredients vary, so there are questions about what dose might be helpful. But the evidence suggests none of them make a huge difference anyway, and they're of limited benefit.' Women struggling to access their usual HRT should look on the British Menopause Society's website for equivalent alternative preparations, he added.  It also contains details of alternative remedies, their reputed benefits and a summary of the scientific evidence behind them. thebms.org.uk MAKE SURE IF YOU SWITCH HRT, YOU GET THE RIGHT DOSE Dr Louise Newson, menopause specialist It is important that women don't go without HRT if they're on it, because the symptoms that HRT improved might come back, says GP and renowned menopause specialist Dr Louise Newson. 'The shortage is not a long-term problem, and it's mainly the oestrogen gel,' she says. There is absolutely no shortage of stock of Evorel patches of any strength, for example, she says. 'If people are being told by their pharmacist that there is a shortage of Evorel, there isn't. 'The pharmacist should contact the customer services of the manufacturer, Theramex, and get more stock.' Some women find that HRT patches don't stick on very well, but since these patches in general are not in short supply, this should not be a major problem.  'You can just use a few more - if the patch comes off, just stick a new one on,' says Dr Newson. Another option is to get an alternative prescription for an HRT you can take orally. 'With some tablets, there's a small risk of clot. With others, it doesn't seem that there is. But you can have that as a short-term measure.' Again, tablets don't seem to have been affected by the shortages, she says. If you do switch to taking HRT via a new method, it's important to make sure you get an equivalent dose, she says. 'I'm hearing stories of people who were on two pumps of gel - a medium dose - being given a really low strength of patch.'  She has even heard of a patient being given vaginal oestrogen cream as an alternative to the gel. 'That was never going to work because that cream just works in the vagina.' She urges women to keep checking local pharmacies for new stock. 'Manufacturers are working really hard to replenish the stocks,' she says. 'Even if the pharmacist doesn't have it one day, they might have it on another.' She also warns against an alternative type of HRT offered by some private clinics, called compounded bioidentical hormone therapy.  These are drug preparations that are marketed as 'more natural' than the standard HRT offered on the NHS. 'Compounded bioidentical hormones are neither licensed nor regulated,' says Dr Newson. 'There's no evidence they work and they are potentially dangerous.' At the end of the day, she says, the only treatment for the menopause is HRT because the menopause is a hormone deficiency. 'There are all sorts of things that might or might not help with symptoms, but they're not going to reduce the risk of osteoporosis, heart disease or dementia. All these companies urging you to take their hocus-pocus rubbish are not going to help your future health.' One of the reasons she takes HRT herself is because she doesn't want osteoporosis and is scared of dementia.  She says: 'Taking HRT reduces that risk, whether I have symptoms or not. I would not want to come off HRT because I'd worry that I would have increased bone turnover, risk of osteoporosis, my memory would go and everything else.' Preparing For The Perimenopause and Menopause by Dr Louise Newson, Penguin Life Expert, PS9.99. TRY SOYA, B VITAMINS AND OMEGA-3 Dr Marilyn Glenville, natural health expert Can eating soya help reduce menopause symptoms? Women's health expert Dr Marilyn Glenville, of Glenville Nutrition Clinics, thinks so. Soya - or rather, foods such as soya milk and tofu - along with celery, green beans, chick peas, lentils, Japanese tempeh and miso, all contain plant compounds known as phytoestrogens that have a similar chemical structure to oestrogen produced by the body. Phytoestrogens are also found in some edible grains, including pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds and flax seeds. The compounds became of interest to scientists when they noticed that women in certain traditional cultures like that of Japan, who eat a diet rich in these plant foods, have fewer menopausal symptoms than other women. Last year a study found that women who switched to a plant-based, soy-rich diet during menopause could reduce the number of hot flushes they experienced by up to 84 per cent. The research by George Washington University involved 38 women who followed a low-fat plant-based diet with cooked soy beans over a 12-week period.  The average number of moderate-to-severe hot flushes that the women on the diet experienced fell from five to one per day and were totally eliminated in 39 per cent of cases. However, overall the evidence is mixed, as many of the studies that have been conducted into phytoestrogens are deemed by scientists to be too small and too short to produce solid results. Some reviews have therefore concluded that the evidence is not strong enough to recommend phytoestrogens as a menopause symptom solution. However, Dr Glenville, 70, says phytoestrogens were an important part of her own diet when she herself was menopausal. She says: 'I would have flax seeds on my porridge and houmous or lentil soup at lunchtime.'  As a result, she thinks the hormonal changes her body was going through happened more slowly: 'For me, it cushioned the transition,' she says. Dr Glenville also recommends taking additional nutrients, such as B vitamins and magnesium, to treat menopausal symptoms. 'Those can work very well.' Studies suggest that taking magnesium supplements can reduce insomnia symptoms and reduce the likelihood that a woman will fall asleep during the day. There is also evidence that suggests a high intake of Vitamin B6, or pyridoxine, might lower the risk of depression in menopausal women. Vitamin B9, also known as folate, was found in one study to be effective at reducing the number and severity of hot flushes women experienced. For help with brain fog, joint pain and vaginal dryness, Dr Glenville advocates increasing your intake of Omega-3 fatty acids, which can be found in oily fish and egg yolks. Although scientific evidence on the benefits of this approach is mixed, she says: 'Omega-3 helps with lubrication, whether that's of the joints, skin or hair.' Natural Solutions to Menopause: How to Stay Healthy Before, During and Beyond the Menopause (Bluebird) is available on Kindle, PS6.99. Why a relaxing tipple before bed could make you feel worse Menopause nutritionist Jackie Lynch says the number-one thing that women who are suffering from hot flushes can do is to 'lose the booze'.  She adds: 'Alcohol - in particular, wine - can be a real trigger when it comes to hot flushes, even if you're just having a civilised glass every night.' Although anecdotally many women report that alcohol can worsen hot flushes during menopause - and exacerbate poor sleep - the scientific evidence is mixed. Some research even found that women who drank alcohol at least once a month were less likely to have hot flushes than women who abstained entirely. But if you're a regular wine-drinker, it might be a good incentive to investigate non-alcoholic alternatives. If you are looking for something to cheer up the evening, Jackie suggests opting for a mocktail instead. Some studies have linked obesity to worse menopause symptoms - in particular, night sweats and hot flushes, but also muscle and joint pain plus bladder issues. Jackie Lynch's Cooling Watermelon Mocktail. The high water content of watermelon can help to hydrate and cool the body if you're struggling with hot flushes.   1 Take the flesh out of a watermelon and a couple of handfuls of raspberries and mash them through a sieve. 2 Put the fruity mix in a blender and add the juice of half a lemon and a teaspoon of honey (optional) for sweetness, and whizz it up to a puree. 3 Stir it together with sparkling water in a jug - use as much or as little as you want to make the consistency exactly how you like it. 4 Pour into a cocktail glass with some crushed ice, a slice of lime and a sprig of mint and serve. Jackie says a balanced diet is key, and warns against cutting out fat: 'Fat is often demonised but it's important to recognise that the body uses dietary fat - in particular, saturated fat - to make sex hormones.' At the same time, she suggests that reducing refined sugar intake is a good idea. 'It's not just alcohol that plays havoc with hot flushes - sugar is terrible too. If you're spending a lot of time having sugary treats and chocolate cakes, now is a good time to limit that.' Many women fear they will gain weight during the menopause. Last month a major study was published with evidence that suggests that these concerns are justified and that the menopause leads to significant changes in women's metabolism.  These changes have been linked to excess weight gain and a higher risk of heart disease, along with greater sugar consumption. Jackie recommends eating a combination of protein, fat and fibre with every meal and snack, to ensure you give your body everything it needs. 'I think that's crucial,' she says. Instead of going low-carb, which many people try these days in a bid to shed pounds, she suggested opting for wholegrain bread, brown rice and vegetables. Evidence also suggests that low magnesium levels - a nutrient found in wholegrains and dark-green, leafy vegetables, beans and legumes - may be linked to feelings of stress. So if you are suffering from anxiety or mood swings, eating foods that contain magnesium can be beneficial, Jackie says, adding: 'Magnesium calms the nervous system and regulates the body's response to stress.' Eating a couple of handfuls of spinach, rocket, kale, broccoli, watercress or cabbage with each meal will boost magnesium levels, she suggests. Another of her tips is to have a bath with epsom salts, which contain magnesium that can be absorbed through the skin. Put two or three handfuls in a bath and have a good soak for 20 minutes to allow the magnesium to absorb into your skin, she advises.  'If you've had a really stressful day and you're feeling agitated, it can help to relax you and set you up for a better night's sleep.'

  "ec6f19fab4114043f8689959d947d5b88f9a09589dfdcf04af13f440": "After a decade working in London left him battling with depression, the Duchess of Cambridge's brother, James Middleton, has told The Mail on Sunday how he's turned to farming to find peace.  James and his French financier wife, Alizee Thevenet, are restoring a PS1.45million Berkshire farmhouse, complete with a smallholding.  The move means that the 35-year-old former boss of Boomf, a company that sold personalised marshmallows, is recasting himself as a gentleman farmer - with a sideline in breeding spaniels.  James, left, has sheep, ducks, goats, hens and beehives as well as dogs. The couple plan to become fully self-sustainable - like the characters in TV's The Good Life.  Speaking to The Mail on Sunday last week, James said: 'This morning, I was up at six - vaccinating our flock of Herdwick sheep, which are a wonderful breed from the Lake District but which are known as escape artists! I'm learning as I go.'  James, who, like his sisters Kate and Pippa went to Marlborough College, set up Boomf in 2013 but it went into administration in 2021.  Last year, he spoke candidly about being diagnosed with clinical depression and said that nature had helped to improve his emotional health.  His new property is in Stanford Dingley, near to the village of Bucklebury, where he grew up and where his parents still live.  It's also near where Pippa and her husband James Matthews recently bought a rundown petting zoo. Kate is believed to be planning to move into the area too, along with Prince William and their three children.  James says: 'Living in London, you don't have community. You don't get to know the things in life that people care about. We are so lucky to live in a small village with 100 people and two pubs. Our house dates back to the 16th Century, so when it's windy it blows through the drawing room. But that's the charm.'  James and Alizee - 'it's pronounced like Champs-Elysees, it took me a while to get it right!' - now have six dogs, including Inka 'the naughty one', and golden retriever Mabel, his only non-spaniel.  Later this month, they are due to lead a parade of hundreds of dogs at Goodwoof, a new two-day celebration organised by the Duke of Richmond on his Goodwood estate in Sussex (tickets available from the Goodwood website).  It is described as a 'canine version of the Chelsea Flower Show'. James breeds working spaniels.  Last year he gave a black cocker spaniel to the Duchess of Cambridge after her beloved Lupo - also bred by James - died suddenly at the age of nine.  'Most of the spaniels I breed go to people I know well enough to have a coffee with. I don't advertise,' he explains.  'I always say dogs are a way of life - not an accessory.' James says he wants more people to be able to bring their dogs to work. 'I would encourage more offices to take dogs in, or even provide facilities.'  He also believes more shops should allow dogs inside. While he's speaking about his responsibilities for his animals, the obvious question is whether he and Alizee plan to have children.  James quips that baby goats are the only kids in the farmhouse nursery for now, but adds: 'I think children are inevitably going to be our next direction and we're both very keen and happy to let nature take its course.'  For the moment, though, James is busy tending his animals. The latest addition was a clutch of hen chicks and next he must prepare his dogs to join him as the face of Goodwoof, especially naughty Inka.",
  "fa46291b547174048707a7b10903c66c667f19b07ce6dccd39fb0422": "The long-suffering sister of murdered school boy Rikki Neave has said she wants to confront his killer in jail after he was finally convicted 28 years after murdering him. James Watson, now 41, was last week convicted of killing six-year-old Rikki in 1994 when he was 13 years old and sister Rochelle Neave wants to ask him: 'Why did you kill my brother?' Rochelle, 30, was only 2 years old when depraved sexual fantasist Watson murdered Rikki but she remembers her 'cheeky, loving' brother.  She says she needs to face Watson in order to find out why he did it and get 'closure'. 'What on earth was he thinking, at 13 years old, to murder my brother? 'I want to speak to him and ask him to give me answers,' she told The Mirror. 'But I don't think I'm ever going to get them.'  Rikki's body was found posed naked in a star shape by Watson after he had lured him into some woods in Peterborough, Cambridge and strangled him with his anorak in November 1994. The horrific murder sparked national outrage at the time, less than two years after the abduction, torture and brutal killing of two-year-old James Bulger in Merseyside.  Despite being seen with Watson by neighbours on the morning of his murder, it was Rikki's mother, Ruth Neaves, 53, who was the initial suspect.  Ms Neave was cleared of her son's murder by a jury at Northampton Crown Court following a high-profile 16-day trial but later admitted child cruelty in relation to a number of incidents throughout Rikki's short life, including grabbing Rikki around the throat, pushing him against a wall and lifting him up.  She was jailed for seven years for child cruelty in October 1996.  Watson was interviewed by police as a witness at the time but his lies were not uncovered. It was his web of lies and constantly changing alibis which helped him evade justice for 28 years but he was finally arrested in 2016 after serving eight months for indecently assaulting a sleeping young man.  Rikki's sister Rochelle Neave, 30, was three years old when her big brother was murdered, and she said they had both lived in an abusive home. She and her younger sister Sheradyn Neave, 27, both from the Midlands, were later adopted. Rochelle remembered Rikki as 'so loving, so caring' and said he 'would sort us food out when parents wouldn't do it'. 'He was cheeky,' she said. 'He was so loving, so caring towards us. He would do anything. If there was no food in he would go to the shop, nick it, come back and feed us. 'He would make sure we were clean. He would run a bath. He was so clean, he loved being clean.' She said it was a 'victory' that Watson had been found guilty of murder 'because he thought he'd got away with it for that many years and thought we were just going to go away and roll under the table'. 'We weren't,' she added. She said that when prosecutors felt there was insufficient evidence, she was part of a victim's right to review to get the decision reversed. 'We wrote a statement saying how we feel this cold case needs to be solved,' said Rochelle. She said she had felt 'angry' when Watson had fled to Portugal, while on police bail, and shared photographs of himself in the sunshine. 'I thought 'if you're not guilty of murder, why would you run away',' she said. She said of her biological mother Ruth Neave, who was cleared of Rikki's murder in 1996 but jailed for seven years after admitting child cruelty: 'I can't stand her. 'I can't even look at her. The things that she's put us through and our poor brother, how he's been treated, how he was murdered.'  Her younger sister Sheradyn, who was a baby when Rikki was murdered, said: 'I think what's so tragic as well is the fact that he was just so small and so vulnerable and he came from such a bad home and it's just unlucky that he's come across (Watson).' She said: 'I don't let my kids out of my sight.' Watson's DNA had been found on adhesive tapings on Rikki's clothes. But in 2018 prosecutors decided to drop the case because of 'insufficient evidence'.  Watson likely would have finally gotten away with Rikki's murder had it not been for Rochelle successfully challenging the decision. Rochelle saw Watson put on trial at the Old Bailey and found guilty of Rikki's murder last week. She sat in the courtroom for every day of the 11 day trials and called it 'very hard' to listen to the evidence.  'He was smug. He was cocky. It was just like 'The James Watson Show'.  According to Rochelle, Watson would roll his eyes and laugh at her family through the dock window. 'The thing that really got me is that he tried to cry in the box when he was giving his testimony, and it was the most pathetic attempt to cry I've ever seen in my life. 'He wiped his eye one time, wiped his nose, and then carried on.' It took the jury 36 hours and 31 minutes of deliberation to convict James Watson by a 10-2 verdict.  Jury members heard how Watson's DNA was found on adhesive tapings on Rikki's clothes, and that Watson's posing of the six-year-old's naked body was an act carried out for his own sexual gratification.  Jury members at the Old Bailey heard how Watson was arrested after sophisticated technology found a 'definitive match' between his DNA profile and samples taken from Rikki's clothing after a new investigation was opened into the case. Watson fled the country on a ferry at Dover in June 2016, before eventually consenting to his extradition from Portugal two months later.   Jury members in the three-month-long trial at the Old Bailey in London heard how Watson wrapped the collar of Rikki's blue anorak around the younger boy's throat from behind him, pulling tightly for at least 30 seconds, in order to kill him. They were also told how Watson - a convicted arsonist with 'morbid fantasies' and a 'sexual interest' in small children - had molested a five-year-old child a year before the murder and throttled a girlfriend during sex. Reacting to the verdict, his mother Ruth Neave, 53, said she 'hated' Watson but admitted she regretted being on drugs when Rikki was killed.  'Because I was never allowed to go out when I was a kid, I was stuck inside, so I give him [Rikki] extra [freedom]. But what I do regret, is being on drugs as well. I was only on it for a year. One year everybody, one year.' Rochelle said she still holds her mother - who beat and neglected Rikki - accountable for his death.   She said: 'Even though she didn't strangle him, she still let a six-year-old on the streets alone and she neglected him. All she was interested in was drugs and men and drink.  'I can't stand her. I can't even look at her. The things that she's put us through and our poor brother, how he's been treated, how he was murdered.' But Rochelle proclaimed the verdict a 'victory' for justice and for her murdered brother, who she described as 'loving, caring and cheeky'. Speaking after today's long-awaited verdict, she said: 'He was so loving, so caring towards us. He would do anything,' 'If there was no food in he would go to the shop, nick it, come back and feed us. 'He would make sure we were clean. He would run a bath. He was so clean, he loved being clean.' Rochelle said it was a 'victory' that Watson had been found guilty of murder 'because he thought he'd got away with it for that many years and thought we were just going to go away and roll under the table'. We weren't,' she added.",
  "187d1b51502de54f2d52331e7c6a16ea248a7d8ca0576f7ebad8373e": "Tory MP Michael Fabricant has apologised for suggesting many teachers and nurses enjoyed a 'quiet drink' at the end of the day in staff rooms during lockdown. In a letter published on the National Association for Headteachers (NAHT) schools leaders' union website following outrage from the sector over his comments, Mr Fabricant said it was not his intention to 'cause offence' or to 'demoralise'.  He said: 'I applaud the work of nurses, GPs, and others in the medical and teaching professions who worked long hours under difficult, and sometimes impossible, conditions during the height of the Covid pandemic to keep us all safe and to educate our children.' He told the BBC he was neither 'judging nor chastising the minority of nurses or teachers who chose to unwind with a few work colleagues after a long shift'. 'Nor did I suggest that any were drunk,' he added in the interview. Earlier this month, nurses and teachers slammed the Lichfield MP for using the claim of their staff room drinks as justification for Boris Johnson to not resign after his partygate fine. Some revealed how they took work breaks in their cars due to how strict they believed social distancing rules were at the time.  'You couldn't even have a break with someone in the same room let alone a drink after work,' according to one nurse.  Unions said NHS staff were just happy to 'get home, clean their uniforms, shower and collapse into bed' after watching patients die during their shift. Mr Fabricant said he did not think Prime Minister Boris Johnson knew he was breaking the law when he attended a gathering in Downing Street in June 2020 to celebrate his 56th birthday. Mr Johnson has subsequently paid a fine for attending the event in violation of coronavirus rules. Mr Fabricant said: 'I don't think at any time he thought he was breaking the law... he thought just like many teachers and nurses who after a very long shift would go back to the staff room and have a quiet drink.' In his apology, Mr Fabricant said that since the interview, a number of other cases of teachers drinking at school had been brought to his attention. He added this was 'not surprising given that there are some 500,000 nurses and 625,000 teachers throughout Britain', and he acknowledged the number of after-work drinks remained among a 'small minority'. He said: 'My error in one part of the programme - which was repeated on TV - was to give the impression this was general practice by nurses and teachers: this was never the case.' In his letter to NAHT general secretary Paul Whiteman, he said he felt that 'if people were working closely together during the day and then met alone, without outsiders being present, they would be unlikely to spread infection'. He added: 'In the small number of cases where people did have a quick drink with close work colleagues, I both understand and sympathise with people who had endured a long and exhausting day. We are all human.' He called for more 'tolerance' for everyone who had been in a 'stressful' work environment during lockdown and had met with colleagues afterwards. Mr Whiteman said: 'We are pleased that Mr Fabricant has expressed regret for the effect of his comments - they were unjustified, unhelpful and damaging. 'While we appreciate his explanation, we must reiterate that we do not recognise the picture Mr Fabricant painted of teachers drinking together during lockdown.  'Education professionals worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic to keep pupils safe, supported and learning under exceptionally difficult circumstances.' At its annual conference in Telford this weekend, the NAHT will discuss condemning Mr Fabricant's comments and applauding the 'swift public intervention' of Mr Whiteman, who wrote to Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi to criticise the 'wholly inaccurate and deeply insulting' remarks. A conference motion says: 'The subsequent apology issued by Mr Fabricant in response is welcome but we note that the slur has not been withdrawn. 'All too often we see baseless slurs and allegations made about the profession in an attempt to direct attention away from political failure.' It calls on the union to 'publicly correct false impressions without fear or favour at every opportunity'.",
  "129278795e928a46fdcbea9ede1d8435f2e518dc72dfa2584072bb38": "Princess Charlene looked pensive today during the first public appearance she's made with husband Prince Albert since November.  The couple were also accompanied by their seven-year-old twins Princess Gabriella and Prince Jacques, as the family attended the Monaco E-Prix. They have rarely been seen together since Zimbabwean-born Charlene, 44, spent some 10 months in South Africa last year, after contracting a serious sinus infection during a solo charity trip. The illness left her hospitalised and delayed her return to Monaco.  After returning to Monaco last November, Charlene almost immediately left and went to Switzerland to receive treatment for 'exhaustion'. Today's photos mark the first time the Monaco royals have been seen in public together as a family since Charlene returned to the principality following her treatment.    Charlene was pictured wearing an all-grey ensemble, pairing her trouser suit with a matching top. Her blonde crop was neatly coiffed, and she wore elegant make-up, including liquid eye liner and natural glossy lips. She has faced a variety of health problems, including what the palace has previously referred to as a 'state of profound general fatigue' over the last year, which have kept her largely out of the public eye. The Monaco palace has consistently denied media reports of a rift between Charlene and the principality's ruler Prince Albert, who were wed in 2011. Rumours the pair were incompatible were sparked from the outset, with Charlene attracting a barrage of attention over an apparent bad dose of pre-wedding jitters which, reportedly, saw her seeking refuge in her country's embassy and gaining the moniker 'the Runaway Bride'.  Charlene first had a 10-month absence in her native South Africa, where she contracted and was hospitalised for a serious sinus infection that delayed her return to Monaco.  She underwent surgery in October for an ear, nose and throat infection after checking in under a pseudonym in a Durban hospital, a palace source said at the time.  After her return to the principality in November, Charlene left almost immediately to receive treatment for 'exhaustion' at a Swiss clinic.  Friends previously told Page Six that the mother-of-two 'almost died' while she was in her home country, while her husband spoke out to say she is suffering from 'exhaustion, both emotional and physical'.  'She was clearly exhausted, physically and emotionally. She was overwhelmed and couldn't face official duties, life in general or even family life,' Albert told People magazine in November.  A palace statement released on December 23 revealed Albert and the couple's children were planning to visit Charlene during the Christmas holidays, as well as asking for the family's privacy to be respected.  It added that the princess 'is recuperating in a satisfactory and reassuring manner, although it may take a few more months before her health has reached a full recovery.'  But distinguished royal journalist Stephane Bern has long speculated that Charlene's litany of supposed health problems could simply be a cover-up to excuse her from participating in royal activities alongside her husband. Bern said in January of last year, Charlene was expected to make a trip to visit French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, but suddenly came down with an illness.  'The princess had contracted a sudden gastroenteritis,' he said.  'The Palace has had to invoke a suffering princess so often that the Monegasques today find it hard to believe. By crying wolf, the mother of Jacques and Gabriella has discredited and isolated herself.' The couple released an official family portrait earlier this month to mark Easter. A body language expert noted that Albert looked 'tense' in the image, while highlighting the close bond shared by Charlene and her children. Body language expert Judi James told FEMAIL that Albert, 64, likely wanted to signal 'resilience and strength' with his 'family protector' pose in the image - but instead stood 'awkwardly' in the background.    Judi added that while Albert was not fully touching his wife, he placed his hand on son Jacques's shoulder as a 'gesture of parental reassurance'.  Meanwhile Charlene, 44, demonstrated her 'loving bond' with daughter Gabriella, signalling how her relationship with her children has remained strong despite her spending months apart from her family. Charlene and Albert's marriage has made numerous headlines over the years, with a third paternity suit emerging in December 2020.  Soon afterwards Charlene famously shaved half her head in the style of a punk rocker. Months later she left for South Africa. The allegations in December 2020 claimed that Albert had fathered a love-child (which would be his third, if proven) with an unnamed Brazilian woman during the time when he and Charlene were already in a relationship. The woman said she met the prince in a nightclub in Rio de Janeiro in 2004 -- when Charlene and Albert were supposedly dating.  Her daughter, a 15-year-old Brazilian schoolgirl, sent a handwritten note in Portuguese to Prince Albert at the Royal Palace last September. Albert's legal team call the allegations 'a hoax' and the legal team of the woman concerned declined to comment.  It was due to come to court in Milan in February but never commenced. Some believe the matter has been settled. But the Prince has also fathered two other children outside of wedlock. Jazmin Grace Grimaldi, who is now 29 and the result of Albert's affair with an American estate agent, and Alexandre Coste, 18, whose mother is a former Togolese air hostess. Both children were struck off Monaco's line of succession in return for vast financial settlements.  Charlene has directly attempted to address the talk about a third possible love child. She told Point de Vue magazine last January: 'When my husband has problems, he tells me about it. I often tell him, 'No matter what, I'm a thousand percent behind you. I'll stand by you whatever you do, in good times or in bad.'  Illegitimate love children aside, it's fair to say royal life in Monaco must have come as a complete culture shock to the former Charlene Wittstock. The daughter of a swimming instructor and photocopier salesman, she grew up in crime-ridden Benoni, near Johannesburg. As a child, she developed a passion for swimming and, in 1996, won her first South African Championship at the age of 18.  Four years later, she qualified for the 2000 Olympic Games as a member of the South Africa 4 x 100m medley relay team - which was placed fifth. Charlene met Prince Albert at the Mare Nostrum swimming competition in Monte Carlo in 2000 when she was 22. The pair took their relationship public in 2006 at the Winter Olympic Games and announced their engagement in 2010.  Yet in the run up to the wedding, rumours began to circulate about Charlene's unhappiness and homesickness. There were claims that Charlene had tried to flee back to Africa three times before the marriage, and at one stage 'took refuge' in her country's embassy, leading to the 'Runaway Bride' headlines. Charlene denied all of the stories as 'utter fabrications' but wept throughout their wedding. She explained later: 'Everything was just so overwhelming and there were all the mixed emotions because of the rumours, and obviously all this tension built up and I burst into tears.  'And then I burst into tears some more because I was thinking, ''Oh no, now the whole world has seen me cry.'' The question remains whether she will be content to shrink her horizons to the 0.8 square miles of Monaco, particularly as the twins get older and are expected to be sent to boarding school.

  "ea199b24237f04ee9f5963b920de4fda8ed50c0064e982291a8512e9": "Russia is set to pull out of the International Space Station and will no longer work with NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), according to the head of its space programme. General Director of Roscosmos Dmitry Rogozin told Russian state TV earlier today that Moscow will no longer co-operate with its international partners aboard the ISS, confirming that the decision to withdraw has already been taken. He said Roscosmos is not required to give an exact date of its withdrawal, but affirmed the Russian space programme will adhere to the stipulated year-long notice period. 'The decision has been taken already, and we are not obliged to discuss it publicly, Rogozin told Rossiya 24 - though on Friday he said Russia would continue to work on the ISS 'according to the time frame set out by our government, until at least 2024.' It comes after Rogozin posted a storm of since-deleted tweets earlier this month in which he slammed Western sanctions imposed on Russia amid its invasion of Ukraine. 'I believe that the restoration of normal relations between partners in the International Space Station and other joint projects is possible only with the complete and unconditional lifting of illegal sanctions,' the space chief tweeted. Space is one of the last remaining areas of cooperation between Moscow and Western nations, and Russia has for decades carried American astronauts to and from the ISS on board its Soyuz rockets, but ceased to do so in 2020. The U.S. and Russia were conducting negotiations for a resumption of shared flights in February, but the invasion of Ukraine put paid to the plans and triggered a wave of unprecedented sanctions on Russian state-linked entities. NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei shared a Russian ride back to Earth in late March after a U.S. record 355 days at the ISS alongside two Russian cosmonauts, and suggested the relations between the crew aboard the ISS had remained unaffected by the war in Ukraine. 'About my relationship with my Russian crewmates, they were, are and will continue to be very dear friends of mine,' the American Vande Hei said during a press conference earlier this month. 'We supported each other throughout everything,' he said. 'And I never had any concerns about my ability to continue working with them.' But doubts remain over whether NASA, ESA and other space agencies will be able to maintain operations aboard the ISS without support from Russia. Nathan Eismont, a leading researcher at the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, said that the operation of the ISS would become almost impossible if Russia withdrew from the project. The researcher's statement echoed that of former cosmonaut and Roscosmos director Sergei Krikalev, who told Russian news site Izvestia that cooperation between Russian and American specialists in space is 'necessary for productive work' on the ISS. The ISS is jointly managed by Moscow and Washington, and a complete Russian pull-out would pose major challenges for the operation. Rogozin warned Washington earlier this month on Russian state TV that Moscow's exit from the ISS would pose significant issues, because Russian rockets deliver much of the cargo needed to maintain the space station. '[Western partners] cannot manage without Russia, because no one but us can deliver fuel to the station,' he said. 'Only the engines of our cargo craft are able to correct the ISS's orbit, keeping it safe from space debris.' However, in recent years NASA has worked with private commercial entities, most notably Elon Musk's SpaceX, to deliver cargo and conduct manned flights into space, which could help to reduce their reliance on Russia's space programme to maintain the ISS. SpaceX earlier this week launched four astronauts to the ISS for NASA, less than two days after completing a flight chartered by millionaires. The latest flight carried a NASA crew comprised equally of men and women, including the first black woman making a long-term spaceflight, Jessica Watkins. SpaceX has now launched five crews for NASA and two private trips in just under two years. A week after the new crew arrives, three American astronauts and one German will return to Earth from the ISS, also aboard a SpaceX capsule.  ",

Travellers are being left frustrated in their attempts to contact the airline and the Government agency, sometimes waiting for hours on hold or having their calls repeatedly cut off. People trying to get in touch with the Passport Office being left waiting two weeks for urgent calls back, with an employee at the agency blaming 'terrible management'. Speaking to The Times, the employee said the agency's helpline, which is run by French firm Teleperformance, is a 'shambles' which has led to 'countless' people missing their holidays.  Meanwhile, British Airways is only answering one phone call in every 20 and has cancelled hundreds of flight amid ongoing staff shortages after getting rid of 13,000 staff during the pandemic. Travellers trying to get through to the airline to rebook flights after they were cancelled report going for weeks without hearing from the company.  One family said they spent 15 hours on hold after ringing 14 times and still never managed to speak to someone.  It is reported in The Times that passport applicants that are able to make it through to the Passport Office often find staff are unable to help them, and phone calls back to them that have been promised don't materialise for weeks. The employee, who asked not to be named, told the paper: 'It's a shambles.  'Teleperformance is missing all service level agreements and not by days, by weeks. The urgent call back queues had a two-week wait when I last worked it.  'Lost and stolen was 15,000 records over its service level agreement. 'Staff aren't trained, they are thrown in and make countless errors, and are constantly being shifted from department to department.  'It's an absolute mess and customers are suffering. I've made countless people cry by telling them they are not going to get their passport on time.' They added the felt the problems could be fixed by Teleperformance taking on more staff. The Passport Office told The Times: 'As part of our plans to deal with the record 9.5 million applications expected in 2022, we've increased staff numbers by 500 since April 2021.  'Our extensive preparations have helped us to handle more applications than ever before, with more than one million processed in March.  'The Home Office has raised concerns with Teleperformance about its delivery.  'Teleperformance is urgently working to add extra staff and significantly improve current performance.' British Airways told the paper: 'Our contact centres are extremely busy at the moment and we're working hard to improve our customers' experience.  'We're currently prioritising customer service calls so we can assist with existing bookings or those who need help urgently.' Teleperformance and Sopra Steria did not offer a comment to The Times. It comes after months of chaos for British travellers eager to travel after Covid restrictions were lifted earlier this year.  Five million Britons have delayed renewing their passports because of coronavirus restrictions.  And post-Brexit travel rules from the EU have complicated matters further as they require travelling Britons to have at least three months validity remaining when travelling to EU member nations. As a result, Britons are now being warned they face a 10-week wait for their passport - instead of the usual three week turnaround time. Last week Prime Minister Boris Johnson threatened to 'privatise the a*** off' the Passport Office and the DVLA unless they step up services.    The PM laid into the 'post-Covid manana culture' at some government agencies as he urged the Cabinet to find efficiencies that can help ease the cost-of-living crisis. The swipe at lingering pandemic practices such as working from home came amid fury at 'nightmare' delays in receiving new passports.   Officials sounded the alarm over the passport delays, which they say are being caused by 'unprecedented demand'. The delays are causing chaos for families who are still yet to receive their passports - despite applying for them months ago. One family today told MailOnline how they face losing out on a PS1,100 holiday to Spain next month because they are still without one of their passports.  Britons say their holiday plans are being thrown into doubt because of 'nightmare' delays in receiving their new passports. Families say they fear missing out on long-awaited trips because they have not yet received the important travel documents - despite applying for them months ago. One family revealed how they were yet to receive a passport nearly two months after ordering it - even after shelling out an extra PS100 to 'fast track' their application. Meanwhile, a wedding photographer said she faced losing out on a PS3,000 job in France because her passport had not arrived - despite her applying for it back in September.  It comes as officials sounded the alarm over the delays, which they say are being caused by an 'unprecedented demand' for new passports. Officials say five million Britons have delayed renewing their passports because of coronavirus restrictions.  And post-Brexit travel rules from the EU have complicated matters further as they require travelling Britons to have at least three months validity remaining when travelling to EU member nations.

  "e7c8262b8dc44d17e74286c37a7dd2012b7231e657b138a4a319fee4": "Police searching for missing Katie Kenyon, who disappeared in Lancashire last week, have found what they believe to be her body.  The 33-year-old was last seen alive in Burnley on Friday, April 22, getting into a silver Ford Transit van, which was then driven 17 miles into the Ribble Valley.  Since then police have been desperately searching for her, while her ex-boyfriend Andrew Burfield has been charged with her murder.  Now police have sadly confirmed they have found a body they believe to be hers after receiving new information about where she could be.  Officers from Lancashire Police made the discovery searching an area in the Forest of Bowland last night.  Specially trained officers are supporting her family, and a post-mortem will be carried out to determine a cause of death.  Det Supt Gary Brooks, head of Lancashire's Force Major Investigation Unit, said: 'Following extensive police enquiries and after a number of days of searching I can now sadly confirm that we have found a body and at this time we believe it to be that of Katie Kenyon.  'Katie's family have been told and my heart goes out to them at this time. We have specially trained officers supporting them at this difficult time. 'I would like to thank the public and the media for all the help they have given us during what has been a protracted, complex and very emotive search and I would also like to thank both the partner agencies and all of the police officers and staff who have been involved in the search for Katie.  'While this is not the conclusion to those searches any of us would have wished for I know the family appreciate those efforts. 'Once again, my thoughts today are with Katie's family and all of her loved ones.' Her ex-boyfriend Andrew Burfield appeared in court on yesterday charged with her murder. The 50-year-old appeared at Preston Crown Court by videolink from HMP Preston, speaking only to confirm his identity. Burfield, who is from Burnley, entered no pleas and was remanded into custody ahead of a crown court trial in November. For the last week police have been desperately looking for the mother-of-one, with officers searching the Forest of Bowland and Gisburn Forest.  Police set up forensic tents in multiple areas in an effort to trace her after she disappeared last week.  Typically the structures can be used to protect forensic evidence, but may also be staked out to provide cover for equipment.  More than 60 specialist search officers from four police forces have been scouring land looking for her. The hunt involved police and fire service officers, dog teams, mounted police, mountain rescue volunteers and drones.  Scores of officers have been seen scouring the 3,000-acre Gisburn Forest, some 23 miles from Todmorden Road in Ms Kenyon's hometown.  Ms Kenyon was seen getting into a silver Ford Transit van which left Burnley towards the Bolton-by-Bowland area at around 9.30am. On Friday they were seen searching an area of Gisburn Forest, but later directed their attentions back to the Forest of Bowland after receiving information about her location.   A JustGiving page in her memory has so far raised PS7,400. A message from the family read: 'On Friday April 22, our heartbreaking nightmare began when our Katie was taken away from her children and family far too soon. 'We as family are putting together this JustGiving page for Katie to have the best send-off that Katie deserves & for Katie's son and daughter & their future to fulfil Katie's dreams she had planned with her children. 'As we know you all want to help, this would be the most appreciated way. Any donations will be truly, gratefully received. Thank you for all your kind words and support. We know you're all behind us.'",
  "8d9f84660fe0a4af07ac06fd16f2c2fdfe5ea153c2a6c23d9cdb8a80": "The McLaren Formula One team has pledged to investigate historic social media posts allegedly made by an employee that called Lewis Hamilton a 'p****' and a f***ing 'w*****'. The social media account allegedly sent out a string of abusive posts about the seven-time Formula One world champion from their now-deleted private Twitter and Facebook accounts.  One from December 2020, when Hamilton tested positive for Covid ahead of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix and had to complete a 10-day quarantine before returning for the race, read: 'What a f***ing w***** he truly is! Couldn't stand seeing someone do well!' That came after Hamilton was replaced by his now team-mate George Russell at the Sakhir Grand Prix in Bahrain. Russell led for most of the race before the Mercedes pit crew fitted the wrong tyres to his car, meaning he eventually finished down in ninth. The account also allegedly replied 'f***ing p****' to a tweet from the official Formula One account that tagged Hamilton last year. When Hamilton was awarded a knighthood, they wrote: 'Oh f*** off! For having the fastest car on the grid. What a w*****.' And when Hamilton was disqualified from qualifying at the Brazilian Grand Prix in November last year, the staff member said: 'F***ing get in!!! F*** off you p****.' Hamilton won the Formula One World Championship with McLaren in 2008.   When the tweets came to light on Friday night, the official McLaren F1 account responded: 'We consider these comments to be completely at odds with our values and culture at McLaren. 'We take the matter extremely seriously and are investigating it as a priority.' Sportsmail has contacted McLaren for further comment. All of the employee's private social media accounts appeared to have been suspended or deleted as of Saturday.",
  "5ad891f6a4b1d25d8a94e0e1d4873735fb800365ea3ac49c383b2a03": "Russian state TV has brazenly simulated how Vladimir Putin would launch a nuclear strike on three capital cities in Europe, declaring there would be 'no survivors', in response to comments made by the UK's Armed Forces Minister supporting Ukrainian strikes on Russian infrastructure. Hosts on Channel One's 60 Minutes programme announced the cities of London, Paris and Berlin could be hit within 200 seconds of nuclear missiles being launched, as tensions ramp up amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. It comes as ex-Nato chief Richard Sherriff warned the West must 'gear itself up' for a 'worst case scenario' war with Russia in Ukraine, amid reports the Russian president could use the country's victory day parade on May 9 to declare 'all-out war' on its neighbour.  On Thursday's show the chairman of the nationalist Rodina party, Aleksey Zhuravlyov, pondered what would happen if Russia launched nuclear weapons against the UK, saying: 'one Sarmat missile and the British Isles will be no more.' When pulled up on the comment by one of the hosts, he insisted he was 'saying this seriously', while another host added that the UK has nuclear weapons too and that 'no one will survive in this war'. Producers on the show then showed viewers a map seeming to suggest missiles could be launched from Kaliningrad, the Russian enclave between Poland, Lithuania and the Baltic Sea. It suggested these could reach Berlin in 106 seconds, Paris in 200 seconds and London in 202 seconds. It comes as the UK and other western nations continue in their support for Ukraine, with allies providing equipment, military vehicles and weapons to the beleaguered country. In response to the western support of Ukraine, war-mongering Putin ordered the military to test-fire its Sarmat missiles, which are also known as Satan II. Last week Putin bragged that his country's hypersonic missiles could 'break through all modern defences' and could be ready to strike the UK 'by autumn'. The alarming remarks were made on the show, which is one of Russia's most watched TV programmes, while hosts and guests discussed comments made by James Heappey, the Armed Forces Minister, in which he said strikes by Ukraine on Russian soil would be 'legitimate' if they disrupted supply lines. The show has been hosted by wife and husband Olga Skabeyeva and Evgeny Popov, who are married with each other, since September 2016, and is one of Russia's most watched programmes.  On the show a furious Zhuravlyov said: 'One Sarmat [missile] and that's it - the British Isles are no more.' When Skabeyeva, who has been nicknamed the 'Iron Doll of Putin TV' for her criticism of opposition parties cautioned 'but we are serious people', the politician hit back 'and I am saying that seriously'. 'They're accusing us of state terrorism', he fumed, prompting Popov to say 'the UK also has nuclear weapons'. Popov added: 'No one will survive in this war when you propose the strike with a Sarmat. Do you understand that no one will survive? No one on the planet.' Zhuravlyov doubled down, declaring 'we'll start with a blank slate', before saying the missiles 'can't be intercepted'. 'Their abilities are limited. They say they can shoot it down, we'll see about that,' he added.  A map showing the how quickly the missiles could hit the capital cities of the UK, France and Germany was then put on the screen by the producers, indicating the missiles could be launched from Kaliningrad.  Skabeyeva urged caution, saying: 'Sarmats are not in Kalinigrad yet. From Kaliningrad to Berlin is 106 seconds, from Kaliningrad to Paris is 200 second. You're interested in London, 202 seconds to London.' An incandescent Zhuravlyov continued: 'They need to be shown this picture. 'Guys look at this picture - count the seconds, can you make it? Hello, it's already here'.' As Popov struggles to contain his laughter, Zhuravlyov says: 'That's the way. Let them think about it. Get a stopwatch, count (to) 220 seconds. That's how you talk to them, they don't understand anything else.' The tirade came after Mr Heappey told Times Radio it is 'completely legitimate' for Ukraine to launch attacks on Russian soil.  He said: 'It is completely legitimate for Ukraine to be targeting in Russia's depth in order to disrupt the logistics that if they weren't disrupted would directly contribute to death and carnage on Ukrainian soil. 'There are lots of countries around the world that operate kit that they have imported from other countries; when those bits of kit are used we tend not to blame the country that manufactured it, you blame the country that fired it.' It is not the first time Zhuravlyov has come to public attention for his comments on the show - in December last year he called for United States Congressman Ruben Gallego to be kidnapped and jailed for his support of arming and training the Ukrainian military.  A month later he claimed Russia should put nuclear weapons in Cuba and Venezuala as a response to military aid from Nato given to Ukraine and Georgia. He is chairman of the Rodina political party, a far right nationalist party, which supports Vladimir Putin in the State Duma.  In a tweet sharing the video with a western audience, Julia Davies, creator of Russian Media Monitor, said: 'Russian TV keeps threatening nuclear strikes against Western nations, desperately trying to deter them from continuing to help Ukraine.  'On a side note, this is the first state TV host who doesn't seem to be eager to die for the Motherland, arguing with a trigger-happy lawmaker.' It has been reported Putin is set to declare 'all-out war' on Ukraine 'within days' to enable the country to launch a general mobilisation of the population, according to Russian sources and Western officials. Britain's Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said that the Russian president might use Russia's victory day parade on May 9 to announce the mass mobilisation of his reserves for a final push in Ukraine. It comes as ex-Nato chief Richard Sherriff warned the West must 'gear itself up' for a 'worst case scenario' war with Russia in Ukraine.   A Russian military source told the Telegraph: 'The military are outraged that the blitz on Kyiv has failed. 'People in the army are seeking payback for failures of the past and they want to go further in Ukraine.' Earlier this week, the Russian military was said to be furious that Putin had downsized the invasion of Ukraine and called for a new escalation of the conflict. Speaking on Friday, Mr Wallace said Putin may declare a new war against the world's 'Nazis' at the victory day parade which sees Moscow mark the end of Russia's involvement in the Second World War. With Putin's military having failed in their first wave of military objectives, Moscow has re-focused its efforts on seizing both the east and southern coast of Ukraine. However, as in the first months of the invasion, Russian forces are being met with heavy Ukrainian resistance from Kyiv's determined armies. Some analysts had predicted that Putin wanted to be in a position where he could declare some form of victory on May 9. But with Russia's victory day parade now less than two weeks away, that is looking less likely. Instead, Mr Wallace told LBC Radio that Putin could use the occasion to declare a new war on who he would call the world's Nazis to galvanise his populace in another push against the Ukrainian defenders. 'I would not be surprised... that he is probably going to declare on May Day that 'we are now at war with the world's Nazis and we need to mass mobilise the Russian people',' Mr Wallace said on Friday morning. While several countries, including the UK, mark VE Day - the anniversary of the allied victory over Nazi Germany in the Second World War - on May 8, Russia marks the data on May 9 due to the time difference. The end of all combat actions came at 23:01 Central European Time on Tuesday May 8, 1945 - which was already May 9 in Soviet Bloc countries, including in Russia. Mr Sherriff today said Russia was likely to double down on its approach to Ukraine, insisting to its people that it is the right approach. He told BBC Radio 4: 'The worst case is war with Russia. By gearing itself up for the worst case, it is most likely to deter Putin because ultimately Putin respects strength.' It comes a week after Putin announced his regime's latest nuclear-capable missile will be deployed as early as this autumn, saying it will 'force those who try to threaten Russia to think twice'. The Sarmat missile, or 'Satan II', is said to be the world's longest-range intercontinental ballistic missile, capable of striking a target 11,200 miles away - meaning it could easily strike targets in the US and Europe. Putin hailed the development of the missile, which was successfully test-fired earlier this week, 'a big, significant event' for Russia's defense industry, saying the Sarmat will 'ensure Russia's security from external threats and make those who try to threaten our country with aggressive rhetoric think twice.' 'The missile can break through all modern anti-missile defences,' he declared. 'There is nothing like this anywhere in the world, and won't be for a long time.' Western military experts said the Sarmat is capable of carrying 10 or more nuclear warheads and decoys - easily enough to wipe out territories the size of Britain or France in a single strike. However, analysts believe the autumn target revealed by Putin and Dmitry Rogozin, head of the Roscosmos space agency, is an ambitious one because Moscow reported its first test-launch only on Wednesday and more tests will be needed before the missile can be deployed. The test, after years of delays due to funding and technical issues, marks a show of strength by Russia at a time when the war in Ukraine has sent tensions with the US and its allies soaring to their highest levels since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. Rogozin said in an interview with Russian state TV that the missiles would be deployed with a unit in Uzhur, in the Krasnoyarsk region, about 3,000 km (1,860 miles) east of Moscow. He said they would be placed at the same sites and in the same silos as the Soviet-era Voyevoda missiles they are replacing, something that would save 'colossal resources and time'. The launch of the 'super-weapon' was an historic event that would guarantee the security of Russia's children and grandchildren for the next 30-40 years, Rogozin added. A number of countries maintain anti-missile systems which aim to shoot down or destroy missiles before the are able to reach their intended targets. But these systems are typically only effective against small numbers of missiles, travelling well below hypersonic speeds. The advent of hypersonic missile technology and long-range ICBMs, such as Russia's latest Sarmat missile, have made anti-missile systems largely redundant. The U.S.' Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation said that 'despite decades of research, development, and testing, there remains no reliably effective anti-missile system to counter intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs)'. Existing missile defence systems, such as the U.S. Patriot system, can target incoming short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles whose threat is localised to one region, but cannot effectively protect against nuclear-capable ICBMs such as the Sarmat that can deploy warheads across vast areas. According to former Assistant Secretary of Defense and U.S. chief weapons evaluator Philip Coyle: 'All missile defense systems can be overwhelmed... It is only if the attack is limited that the defense can have a hope of not being overwhelmed.'  In the early 2000s, the U.S. began work on developing a specialised system designed to intercept ICBMs, known as the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system. This aims to use a range of sensors and radars, based in locations around the world and in space, to detect ICBM launches and destroy them out of the Earth's atmosphere, before the warheads have a chance to re-enter and hit their targets.  But the programme is wildly expensive and has returned extremely poor results, even in scripted tests in perfect conditions.",
  "e36b332a96ee32a16b7ba807f00b982bf9abb61e243b9128bb4aabdd": "The start of the summer term, and in schools across Britain, teenage boys and girls are diligently preparing for the all-important exams that will shape their futures. Teachers mark practice GCSE and A-Level papers late into the night. Pupils fret about coursework and grades. The smell of freshly cut grass drifts into crowded, silent libraries. Unless, that is, these youngsters have the misfortune to be enrolled at Holland Park School, a famous institution in Kensington, London, known as the 'Socialist Eton' due to its popularity among filthy-rich Left-wing parents who refuse to educate their children privately. This historic bastion of trendy liberalism, where politicians Roy Jenkins and Tony Benn, Labour luvvies Antonia Fraser and Ken Russell, and generations of virtue-signalling local millionaires have sent their offspring, was on Wednesday the scene of an impromptu riot. A protest by about 50 pupils against the recent stewardship of the school (following the departure of their longstanding headmaster) turned ugly when dozens of screaming troublemakers decided to burst out of classrooms and into the corridors. 'Behaviour descended into chaos as 400-plus students were running around the school in period five,' reads a letter of complaint sent by one shell-shocked parent to a local MP. 'Staff felt unsafe and [discussed] calling the police. There is a real concern for the safety of our children . . . Children are now scared to go to school, and some are shaken.' It was the second troubling incident in recent days. On Friday afternoon last week, an altercation at the school gates escalated into a mass brawl involving dozens of Holland Park School pupils outside a sandwich shop in nearby Notting Hill Gate. Details are hazy, but it seems that dozens of police officers, an ambulance and members of the fire brigade were called amid reports (later debunked) that knives had been brandished and acid thrown in the face of a teenage girl. Videos of the aftermath, showing two pupils being handcuffed and one bundled into a police car, have since clocked up more than 5 million views on the social network TikTok. 'It was complete carnage and only good luck prevented someone from being seriously injured,' says another parent. 'Discipline has completely fallen apart. The whole place is a tinderbox. Just a few months ago, Holland Park was an outstanding school. Now it's like something out of Mad Max.' Adds the mother of a sixth form student: 'What is happening at that school is a monumental s***show which could well f*** up my son's A-levels.' Behind the unedifying scenes is an extraordinary political row that has been rumbling away since the back end of last year. In a few short months, it has turned one of London's most sought-after establishments -- whose alumni range from Guardian columnist Polly Toynbee to Oscar-winning actress Anjelica Huston -- into a case study of failure and dysfunction. A few days ago, a ballot of unionised staff members saw 96 per cent of teachers (on an 87 per cent turnout) declare they have no confidence in their entire board of governors. They are now considering strike action. A coalition of roughly 350 parents is pursuing a separate legal complaint against the board. Noisy demonstrations have been staged at the school gates, and staff meetings boycotted. Petitions are being circulated. And a recent emergency inspection by Ofsted is expected to be withering. Governors are meanwhile facing ugly questions over why tens of thousands of pounds has been spent instructing top law firm Mishcon de Reya and political lobbyists to try to end the crisis. The hostility dates back to a decision to dispense with the aforementioned headmaster, Colin Hall, late last year, amid disputed allegations he presided over a 'toxic' environment, with a rigorous focus on discipline and academic excellence that left some students feeling 'anxious and unsafe'. Fallout from the claims saw Hall leave in February. Soon afterwards, governors decided to transfer control to United Learning, Britain's largest Multi-academy Trusts (MAT), which operate outside of local-authority control. That decision has outraged large numbers of parents and pupils, who would prefer Holland Park School to be run either independently, or by a more local organisation (United is based in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire). They have since been mounting a vigorous campaign against the board that signed off the move, while teachers are also vehemently opposing the change. Caught in the crossfire are both the former Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, and his wife, Sally, who send their children to the school and were both occupying seats on its 12-person Board of Governors when some of the contentious decisions were made. Holland Park School opened in 1958 as one of the first comprehensives. It was a testing ground for post-war egalitarianism and during its 1960s heyday it expanded to more than 2,000 pupils. As time passed, however, Holland Park began to symbolise the shortcomings of a Left-wing ethos that pervaded many comprehensive schools. Uniforms were ditched and 'unfair' streaming abolished. Pupils were encouraged to call their teachers by their first names. Misconduct went unpunished. In the early 1970s, Holland Park snubbed the wedding of Princess Anne by requiring pupils to work through the national holiday (they were given a day off later). By the 1980s, as one schools guide put it, 'cool had turned to chaos'. Truancy and drug abuse were rife. In a memoir called Comp, John-Paul Flintoff, a pupil at the time, recalled one school chum became a crack addict who 'cleaned himself up' to become a dealer. Another student said it 'made St Trinian's look like Lucie Clayton' [a 1960s finishing school]. Fast forward to 2001, and Holland Park was one of Britain's most notorious failing schools -- with around 20 per cent of students leaving with no qualifications. Despite its location in one of London's most expensive postcodes, a majority of pupils hailed from sink estates in West London and received an education that condemned them to stay there. Then came Colin Hall. A sometimes abrasive pedagogue, with a relentless work ethic and rigorous teaching standards, he set about reversing the decline, covering graffiti-stained walls in posters of the disciplinary code and accolades for the highest-achieving students. Uniforms were reintroduced along with pupils placed in 'sets' according to ability and constant monitoring via testing. Some PS80 million was raised, via the sale of a playing field, to build a state-of-the-art building containing 36 specialist classrooms along with a gym, roof terrace and 25m swimming pool. In 2010, Holland Park won its first entry into the coveted Good Schools Guide, with more than 90 per cent of pupils obtaining five GCSEs at A*-C (compared to about 70 per cent nationally). A smattering of pupils each year got in to Oxbridge. Its reputation was also transformed: previofusly pegged as a school for virtue-signalling champagne socialists, it came to be regarded as a genuine 'community school,' providing life-changing opportunities. Several of its pupils hail from the Grenfell Community, and one died in the tragedy. Ofsted in 2014 described the school as 'exemplary' and said Hall led with 'a drive and skill admired by all in the community'. But that admiration was in fact far from universal. For Hall's exacting standards had for years upset the trade unions and other vested interests. In 2009, the Guardian ran an article complaining that 'nearly 100 of the existing staff (all NUT members) had left, complaining of stress, bullying, harassment and threats of capability proceedings' if their pupils under-performed. There were also concerns about the school's financial management. Hall's salary, which had been PS70,000 in 2001, doubled in his first decade and then doubled again to an astonishing PS280,000, making him one of the best-paid state-school heads in Britain. In 2019 it emerged that he'd spent PS15,000 on luxury Farrow & Ball paint and PS6,000 on scented candles for the school buildings. Last August, these long-running issues escalated into a major row after two articles in The Guardian raised serious concerns about his reign. One revealed that 26 recently departed staff members had written to the Education and Skills Funding Agency [ESFA], which regulates academies, with examples of what they called abusive management on his watch. Nine signatories had been signed off for stress, depression or anxiety, which they blamed on the work environment, complaining that staff were publicly named and shamed for poor work or exam results. The second letter, signed by 100 former students, claimed that they experienced a 'toxic and abusive' environment. One ex-pupil, Zahra Enver, told reporters that aged 15 she found her face on a poster saying: 'Wanted for poor grades.' 'I actually needed help to turn things round. But there wasn't any of that,' she recalled. 'It was just shaming and humiliation.' By late September last year, Hall's impending retirement had been announced. In the ensuing weeks, six governors -- half the board -- resigned. They were replaced by a raft of professional educationalists. None of them had any obvious connection to the school or local area, but all either worked for or had close professional links to either MATs or large non-profit chains of academy schools. In November, the Government gave the school a 'financial notice to improve' saying it ought to rein in the salaries of top staff. The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea commenced a 'safeguarding review'. An interim headmaster, Arwel Jones, was hired to run the school until September, on a salary equivalent to the thick end of PS200,000. Despite the growing atmosphere of chaos behind the scenes, daily life initially remained relatively unaffected. But everything changed in early March, when the governors announced that they had decided to transfer the school into the control of United Learning. The move came as a complete surprise to staff and parents, none of whom had been offered any chance to say whether they thought it was a good idea. A fractious dispute broke out. Initially, it revolved around hastily convened demonstrations at the school gates by both parents and pupils, and heated discussions among staff, who voted to boycott meetings with the new owners. Both the local council and Conservative MP, Felicity Buchan, are backing calls for the decision to be reversed, while parents have voiced concerns about longstanding links between United Learning's chief executive, Sir Jon Coles, and several of the governors, including interim head Arwel Jones. A pre-action legal letter sent on behalf of the 'collective' earlier this month meanwhile states that they have hired David Wolfe QC and Sarah Sackman, barristers from Matrix Chambers, to seek a judicial review of the decision. Among other concerns, they point out that the school's 'articles of association' require its Board of Governors to contain at least two elected parent representatives. At the time of the contentious decision, there was just one -- John Bercow. His wife Sally's term had ended in December. There are currently no parents on the board since Bercow was forced to resign in mid-March after a Parliamentary report dubbed him a serial bully and a liar. The governors insist that the Board was quorate when the decision was taken. 'The governors' sole priority and guiding principle is to make sure the school is again fit for purpose and providing the first-class education that students have a right to expect,' they said last night. 'It is simply not possible for this to be achieved without significant, long-overdue change.' At the school gate, things are heated, and increasingly personal. The 'collective' was contacted by Sally Bercow this week. 'She asked to join,' says a source. 'We agreed to add her to our email list, but she's blackballed from the WhatsApp group because her husband was on the board which backed the transfer to United Learning.' As to this week's riot, parents were contacted on Wednesday night by Mr Jones. The email concluded: 'We do not condone the actions of these students whatsoever.' Doubtless this is true. But parents and pupils -- whose outstanding school is now going to the dogs -- are entitled to wonder why this kind of thing never happened on his predecessor's watch.",
  "78aa96a79901acc5e2cc21ad1a7aa0fa555ac61794d7e3b550e2abd9": "Council staff are being allowed to work from home up to four days a week - and ministers cannot force them back to their desks. An audit has identified dozens of local authorities that have started 'smarter working' policies that mean employees can spend most of their time at home. Some stand to make millions of pounds by selling off empty buildings, after they hiked council tax bills for households. There are fears that the Government's levelling-up agenda will be hit as shops and cafes in town centres suffer from the loss of trade from absent staff. The former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said: 'They need to be in the office or they cannot provide a proper service.' He said it was already hard enough for people to get hold of staff to help with problems. Steve Baker, deputy chairman of the Covid Recovery Group, said: 'If a majority of council staff are at home most of the time, it's bound to lead to the closure of businesses that supported them when they were in the office.' John O'Connell, of the TaxPayers' Alliance, added: 'Residents fed up with colossal council tax bills and bumper pay rises for staff will be doubly disappointed to find out they're paying a small fortune to bankroll these barren buildings. 'If flexible working is to stay, council officials should be moved out and the savings passed on to hard-pressed residents.' The Daily Mail asked more than 100 of the biggest councils in England if they had developed new working practices and how much time staff had to be in the office. Of the 25 that replied saying they allowed or encouraged more flexible working, two said they only required staff to go in one day a week. Another five said two days, and two asked for a 50-50 split. Hampshire County Council, which put taxes up by 2.99 per cent, said: 'While each department adopts a bespoke approach to hybrid working depending on service requirements, in the main, staff are required to be office-based a minimum of 20 per cent per week.' At Milton Keynes Council, where bills increased by 3.75 per cent, a third of staff applied 'for a formal contractual change to become permanent home workers', although they must go in one day a week. Cornwall Council, where bills rose by 3.15 per cent, said that most staff only wanted to spend two days a week in the office. It now only needs office space for half of its 5,000 staff and hopes to make PS25million from getting rid of property and save PS32million on maintenance Cheshire West and Chester Council said staff in 'agile' roles will work 'predominantly from a home base' but 'may be required to attend the office on occasions'. Nottinghamshire's new policy states: 'A modern workspace is no longer the place that you go, it is what you do and how you do it.' West Berkshire Council, which just put up residents' bills by 3.95 per cent, is embarking on a project known as 'Timelord' under which some staff will spend two days a week in the office and get PS150 a year to buy furniture. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities is not doing anything to get staff back to their offices or encourage the sale of empty buildings. A source said: 'This is a matter for councils.' It emerged this week that Cambridgeshire County Council's new PS18million headquarters has been almost empty because staff were told to stay at home to maintain social distancing even though it has been abandoned by the NHS.

  "087b0f33bc22c99b0deddafb3371108eb8b27f3c213137dc16aeb1e7": "Poland has sent hundreds of tanks to Ukraine as part of renewed heavy weapons shipments to help it win the war against Russia. Warsaw has sent more than 200 T-72s - originally produced by the Soviet Union - into Ukraine in recent weeks, the country's national radio broadcaster said today, along with mobile artillery, drones and rocket launchers as part of a $1.6bn package. Ukraine's allies have massively stepped up support for Kyiv as fierce fighting rages in the east, with Kyiv's generals today saying that Russia is suffering 'colossal' casualties in the pivotal battle for Donbas. Oleksiy Arestovych, a Ukrainian secret service veteran-turned presidential adviser, acknowledged his military is suffering 'serious losses' on battlefields in the east but insisted that Russia's casualties are 'much, much worse'. Meanwhile Ukraine continues to carry out attacks behind Russian lines to cut off vital supply routes, with a fuel dump in the Donetsk region catching fire today. Kyiv has not acknowledged carrying out any of the attacks - which have also hit railway bridges and ammo dumps - but is widely thought to be orchestrating them. Earlier this week, a Ukrainian MP described the blasts as 'karma'. Russia is pouring troops into the battle in Donbass in an effort to force a bloody victory having been defeated in its initial aim to storm in Kyiv, topple the government, and install a puppet regime loyal to Moscow. After it became apparent they did not have sufficient force to take the capital, Russia's generals yanked their units out, patched them up as best they could, and then threw them back into the fight in Donbas. They also adapted their tactics - abandoning precision missile strikes and rapid advances which saw them mauled around Kyiv in favour of slow advances behind walls of blanket artillery in similar tactics to WW1 trench warfare. The move has met with mixed success. Ukraine has acknowledged losing control of some towns and villages, but has made gains elsewhere in counter-attacks. Supplies of heavier weapons including tanks, artillery cannons, precision munitions and anti-aircraft weapons are designed to help with those attacks while ensuring the Ukrainians can destroy as much Russian equipment as possible in the process.    As evidence of the West's dedication to the mission, Joe Biden last night pledged $33billion in aid for Ukraine including $20billion in military aid.  'We need this bill to support Ukraine in its fight for freedom,' Biden said. 'The cost of this fight - it's not cheap - but caving to aggression is going to be more costly.' Zelenskiy tweeted: 'Thank you @POTUS and the American people for their leadership in supporting Ukraine in our fight against Russian aggression.  'We defend common values - democracy and freedom. We appreciate the help. Today it is needed more than ever!' Russia has said the arrival of Western arms into Ukraine means it is now fighting a 'proxy war' against NATO. President Vladimir Putin threatened unspecified retaliation this week, while his foreign minister warned of a threat of nuclear war. Zelenskiy's office said Russia was pounding the entire front line in the eastern Donetsk region with rockets, artillery, mortar bombs and aircraft.  The Ukrainian general staff said Russia was shelling positions along the line of contact to prevent the Ukrainians from regrouping. Britain said fighting had been particularly heavy around the cities of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk, the main part of the Donbas that Russia is still trying to capture, with an attempted advance south from Russian-held Izium towards Sloviansk. 'Due to strong Ukrainian resistance, Russian territorial gains have been limited and achieved at significant cost to Russian forces,' the British defence ministry said in an update. The bloodiest fighting and worst humanitarian catastrophe of the war have been in Mariupol, an eastern port reduced to a wasteland by two months of Russian bombardment and siege. Ukraine says 100,000 civilians are still in the city, which is mostly occupied by Russia. Hundreds of civilians are holed up with last remaining defenders in underground bunkers beneath a huge steel works. Zelenskiy's office said an operation was planned on Friday to get civilians out of the plant, giving no details. In the capital, normal life has largely returned after weeks in which residents were forced to shelter in metro stations from bombardment.  The front line, which come right to the outskirts of Kyiv in March, is now hundreds of miles away. Foreign dignitaries have been flying in to pay their respects to Zelenskiy and his government. But Russia can still hit the city with long range missiles, as it did on Thursday, during a visit by U.N. Secretary-General Guterres, in what Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksiy Reznikov called 'an attack on the security of the Secretary General and on world security'. No one was killed but at least four people were wounded in the missile strike in the capital, which blew out windows and scattered rubble across the streets. 'Kyiv is still a dangerous place and Kyiv is still the target of Russians, of course. The capital of Ukraine is the goal and they want to occupy it,' Mayor Vitali Klitschko said, supervising the cleanup. On Thursday, Guterres visited Borodianka, one of the Kyiv suburbs that Russia had occupied in March, leaving dead bodies in the ruined streets when its forces withdrew. 'I imagine my family in one of those homes, now destroyed and black. I see my granddaughters running away in panic, part of the family eventually killed,' Guterres told reporters in Borodianka, surrounded by scorched, windowless apartment blocks. 'Innocent civilians were living in these buildings, they were paying the highest price for a war which they have not contributed to at all.'",
  "1fdaeace662a3dd675c20fa0a4556c93eb8bc1dcddb2d3b1b16e3712": "The Australian Institute of Petroleum said the national average for petrol prices rose 9.3 cents to 178.2 cents a litre in the past week, the second weekly increase in a row, although still comfortably below the $2-mark at this stage. Commonwealth Securities senior economist Ryan Felsman said international crude prices - which have the biggest influence of petrol prices - have been boosted by fears that supply will continue to be disrupted by the Ukrainian war. 'While COVID-19 lockdowns in China could weigh on crude demand, supporting prices is the increased likelihood that Germany will join other EU member states in an embargo on Russian oil,' he said. A spread of new data also saw monthly house price growth slowing to a pace not seen since October 2020. The CoreLogic national home value index rose just 0.6 per cent in April with the annual rate slowing to 16.7 per cent. Economists say home prices risk going backwards in coming months if they are correct in expecting the Reserve Bank of Australia to start lifting the cash rate at Tuesday's monthly board meeting. Financial markets are fully priced for a 0.15 per cent rise in the cash rate to 0.25 per cent after annual inflation surged to 5.1 per cent. The anticipated modest increase in the cash rate from a record low 0.1 per cent is expected to be followed by increases of 0.25 per cent in subsequent months. 'Having a near-zero cash rate when unemployment is four per cent and inflation is over five per cent makes no sense,' AMP chief economist Shane Oliver said. 'The experience from the late 1960s and 1970s tells us the longer high inflation persists the more inflation expectations will rise, making it even harder to get inflation back down again without engineering a recession.' While rising interest rates may have a bearing on the election campaign, as they did in 2007 when then Liberal leader John Howard lost power, Prime Minister Scott Morrison still has a falling unemployment rate as part of his economic credentials. While job advertising suffered a small fall in April, it still pointed to strong employment growth in the months ahead and a further decline in the unemployment rate. The ANZ job ads series showed a 0.5 per cent fall in April, but was still 26.3 per cent higher than a year earlier and 57.3 per cent up from pre-COVID-19 levels. 'We expect strong labour demand to lead to solid employment gains in the coming months,' ANZ head of Australian economics David Planks said. 'We see the unemployment rate dropping well below four per cent in the second half of 2022, which should reinforce the momentum toward higher wages growth.' March's federal budget forecast the jobless rate falling to 3.75 per cent in coming months, the lowest in almost 50 years. Industries such as manufacturing are being constrained by skill shortages, as well as input price pressures and rising wages costs, although the sector is still growing. The Australian Industry Group performance of manufacturing index rose by a further 2.8 points in April to 58.5, its fastest pace since July 2015. It was the third consecutive month above the key 50-point mark, which separates growth from contraction. 'New orders increased further in April and, with many businesses feeling capacity constraints and difficulties in securing inputs and staff, the pressures on filling orders are set to continue in coming months,' Ai Group chief executive Innes Willox said.",
  "f4a8773be9269bc89e16004b0670145be3394ad4e7248664eac7735a": "Revellers brought the boom back into Britain's nightlife yesterday as thousands of young people in cities across the country enjoyed a night out for the three-day Bank Holiday weekend. Partygoers were keen to make up for lost time after Covid lockdowns over the past two years cancelled many festivities. Young people donned fun-filled outfits including cowboy hats, angel wings, Minnie Mouse costumes and mermaid skirts to celebrate.  Scantily-clad partygoers were pictured in Leeds city centre and Birmingham's Broad Street wearing colourful outfits whilst walking to their favourite bars and clubs. The famous Otley Run in Leeds saw scores of young epople out and about, some wearing fancy dress while others had a natural spring in their step. Among the more unusual sights in Leeds was a cowgirl spotted getting a piggyback from a man dressed as a leprechaun. Other revellers enjoyed a playfight waving foam bars about like Star Wars lightsabers, while merrymakers practiced their can-can dancing in the street. High fashion was also on display, as partygoers showed off their style wearing polka dot blouses, tennis dresses and bold 1970s patterned jumpsuits. In Birmingham, some clubbers took advantage of the warm temperatures as they made their way to and from clubs. Street styling was on display as smartly-dressed young women wore high heels, ankle bracelets and blazers on the tiles in Birmingham. High-waisted combat trousers were also the rage as young people enjoyed the bank holiday weekend in the west midlands city. Some partygoers sported a fun casual look by pairing up their dresses with sneakers, while trendy baseball caps saying 'lifeguard' or 'police' were worn elsewhere. As drinks spilled out on to the streets, revellers in cowboy hats enjoyed some line dancing - complete with pints in hand. Others showed off fun-filled retro looks, such as one 80s party girl wearing a pink utility belt, bomber jacket and leg warmers who hit the streets with her friend dressed as a 70s flower child.",
  "1a38f7dc3d6afac4405cfb6f311cc5cc4fdbd8f9bd5abb3e2376113d": "Columbia University Irving Medical Center appears to have quietly scrubbed any evidence of its longtime relationship with Dr. Mehmet Oz just as his Pennsylvania senate run heats up. Oz., 61, is a trained heart surgeon who has been a professor at the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons since 2001. In 2018, Oz's title with the school was changed to professor emeritus - ostensibly meaning he was retired but still affiliated with the school, the Huffington Post reported in January.  But around the same time, the school also scrubbed its website of all personal pages affiliated with Oz, the Daily Beast reported for the first time on Friday. Currently, there is no mention of Dr. Oz on the medical center's website - save for a dated faculty listing for the celebrity doctor which lists him as a 'special lecturer.' The message on the listed phone number even directs callers to ticket sales for his now-defunct TV show, the publication reported.  Efforts to reach both the medical center and Oz were unsuccessful - and his current status with Columbia University is unclear.  But the news comes amid renewed criticism of Oz from the medical establishment after the Trump-endorsed candidate spent the past year touting the benefits of hydroxychloroquine in treating COVID-19 - despite little evidence of its effectiveness.  The first calls for Oz to be fired from his position with Columbia came in April 2015 after he was accused of pushing highly debatable medical advice on his syndicated TV show.  Those calls came in the form of a letter that was signed more than 1,300 physicians.  The letter accused Oz of 'disdain for science and for evidence-based medicine.' At that time, Columbia stood by the doctor.  During his career with Columbia, Oz held titles such as Vice Chair of Surgery and Director of Integrated Medicine.  Boston-based pediatrician Dr. Daniel Summers was highly critical Columbia quietly distancing themselves from Oz.  Summers told The Daily Beast, 'Their handling of his status there is a massive blot on their reputation. What a chickens**t thing to do.'  Oz, who has for years been accused of spreading medical misinformation - including claims that there was arsenic in apple juice and pushing green coffee extract as a miracle weight loss drug - appeared before a Senate committee hearing in 2015 over some his claims.  Medical ethics expert Dr. Arthur Caplan told The Guardian, '[Oz has] been a huge danger to public health in the US and around the world for a long time with respect to quack cures for Covid and touting quackery to treat diseases.' A 2014 British Medical Journal study of Oz's endorsements found that around half of his claims were not supported by facts.  Following the outbreak of Covid-19, Oz also appeared regularly on Fox News to promote the use of hydroxychloroquine as prevention drug against the virus. That viewpoint was later promoted by then-President Donald Trump.   He promoted the drug heavily on 'The Dr. Oz Show' in the early days of the pandemic. He mentioned it and chloroquine, a similar drug, during more than 25 appearances on Fox in March and April 2020, according to the New York Times. The World Health Organization does not recommend hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of coronavirus, citing the risk of heart rhythm problems, blood and lymph disorders, kidney injury and liver failure.   In April 2022, Oz was said to have bought more than 2,000 doses of hydroxychloroquine that was to be used in a medical study.  When Oz announced his plan to seek the GOP nomination for Pat Toomey's senate seat, he stated his belief that many 700,000 Covid-19 related deaths in United States could have been preventable.  Toomey announced his intention to not seek the Republican nomination in 2020. In February 2021, Toomey was one of the seven Republican senators who voted to convict Donald Trump of incitement of insurrection during his second impeachment trial.  Recent polls show that Oz is trailing hedge fund manager David McCormick in the race for the Republican nomination. Trump is expected appear with Oz at an event on May 6th, 2022 in Greensburg.  In endorsing Oz, Trump made reference to the doctor's successful TV career which the former president described as being 'like a poll.' ",
  "b2ac034e8fdc4688397914874ace40f8980915a98d6a7426597465fc": "Sir Ed Davey has denied rumours of a 'Lib-Lab' pact to compound Tory losses in Thursday's local elections and force Boris Johnson to resign. Tory chairman Oliver Dowden claimed Sir Keir Starmer was standing down candidates 'in swathes of the country' where Lib Dem support is strong to avoid splitting the anti-Tory vote. And he alleges Sir Ed Davey's party has returned the favour where Labour is dominant elsewhere. In a letter to the Labour leader, which he posted on his Twitter account, Mr Dowden claimed that Sir Keir planned to 'deny the voters a proper democratic choice' on Thursday. His comments sparked a political storm, with both Opposition parties denying his accusations. Sir Ed Davey told Ridge on Sky News: 'Listen, there is no pact now, there is not going to be a pact in the future. 'The Liberal Democrats are actually fighting Labour in many areas, in Hull, in Sunderland, in Sheffield, in Haringey, in Southwark and I can tell you many other places where there is a real fight and these council numbers are I think a bit of a detraction. Sir Keir Starmer echoed Davey's sentiments in his own appearance on Ridge. The Labour leader suggested the Conservatives are trying to distract from the cost-of-living crisis by making the accusation that the two opposition parties are standing aside for each other in certain local election contests.  Critics of Mr Dowden highlighted the 2019 General Election where Nigel Farage's Brexit Party stood down in 317 Tory-held seats to avoid splitting the Leave vote and allowing Labour to win the election. They accused the former Culture Secretary of hypocrisy ahead of local elections in over 200 English local authorities on Thursday. Tory strategists fear a drubbing in this week's polls, which come in the wake of months of damaging 'Partygate' headlines over alleged lockdown breaches at No 10. Many of Mr Johnson's enemies in the party have said that they are waiting until after the elections - and the conclusion of the Partygate investigations - before deciding whether to push for a vote of no confidence in Mr Johnson. The fears come after bookmakers made the Liberal Democrats are favourites to win the Tiverton and Honiton by-election triggered by the resignation of 'Porn MP' Neil Parish. Sir Ed's party is 1/3 with StarSports and Ladbrokes to win the by-election triggered by Parish's resignation after admitting that he watched porn twice in the House of Commons yesterday. This puts the party as red hot favourites ahead of the Conservatives who are being priced at 13/8 and 9/4 by the bookmakers. Parish, who has been the MP for Tiverton and Honiton since 2010, confirmed that he will resign as an MP yesterday after admitting to twice watching pornography in Parliament. Parish has a majority of over 24,000 in the constituency which has solely elected Conservatives since it was formed in 1997. The Lib Dems will start from their third-place finish in the 2019 General Election but the scale of the task will likely not deter the party from throwing resources in a hope of another gain. The party successfully saw a swing of over 23,000 in North Shropshire after Tory Owen Patterson resigned amid a sleaze row.  Parish said in an interview with BBC South West that he recognised the 'furore' and 'damage' he was causing his family and his constituency in Devon before deciding 'it just wasn't worth carrying on'. Sir Ed has been touting the potential for the party to eat into the swathe of Conservative strongholds in the south of England nicknamed the 'blue wall' after their victories - having literally knocked down a wall of blue bricks after Sarah Green's win in Chesham and Amersham last year. A Star Sports spokesperson said: 'Punters are more than aware of the Lib Dem by-election machine and they've opened up as 1/3 favourites with Star Sports to win the upcoming by-election despite coming nowhere close in 2019. 'Much has changed since however, whilst a majority of more than 24,000 would appear to be huge mountain to climb, the Liberal Democrats have already overturned two large majorities in the past two years. 'There are many similarities here with North Shropshire, where Owen Paterson resigned after a major scandal, and with thoughts already turning to a big campaign in Devon, they're our favourites with the Tories 13/8 to defend Neil Parish's soon to be vacant seat.' Ed Davey told Sky News Ridge on Sunday: It's right that he's gone so there will be a by-election in Tiverton and Honiton and I believe the Liberal Democrats can be the real challengers in that. 'We have a real legacy of success across the south-west, we've shown in the North Shropshire by-election where we were third in the previous general election but we beat the Conservatives. 'If you look at our local election results, I was proud of what we achieved in May last year and of course there were those two historic by-election victories in true-blue Buckinghamshire, in Chesham and Amersham where no one expected the Liberal Democrats to beat the Conservatives but we did. 'If we want to get Boris Johnson out of Downing Street, which the Liberal Democrats really want to do, only the Liberal Democrats can beat the Conservatives in many, many seats and we have to be part of that ejection of the Conservatives  A Liberal Democrat spokesperson said: 'Right now we are completely focused on the local elections. 'But the Lib Dems have already shown we can take rural seats off the Conservatives. 'People across the West Country have a strong tradition of voting Liberal Democrat as the main opposition to the Conservatives. 'As we saw in North Shropshire, there is a real backlash against Boris Johnson from rural communities who are fed up of being taken for granted. 'Liberal Democrats have a real plan with this bold tax cut, a VAT tax cut worth PS600 on average to families across the country, I think people are looking to us now as an opposition to the Tories in many of their heartland seats.'  Mr Johnson is reeling from the fall-out from yesterday's resignation of Tory MP Neil Parish, who admitted he watched pornography twice in Parliament. Mr Parish, who has represented Tiverton and Honiton in Devon since 2010, said the first incident had been a 'moment of madness' after stumbling on the X-rated images by accident while searching for tractors online but landing on 'another website that had a very similar name'. Mr Parish, who was suspended by the Conservative Party on Friday over the allegations, had been under pressure to resign from senior party figures who feared that the case would further damage Tory chances in the elections. A survey by former Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft, published in today's Mail on Sunday, has found that when voters are asked to choose between a Conservative Government headed by Mr Johnson and a Labour Government headed by Sir Keir, the Labour leader is backed by 57 per cent to Mr Johnson's 43 per cent. However, the research also concludes that Mr Johnson's political future could be ensured by the absence of an obvious Tory successor and Sir Keir's failure to make sufficient impact. Tory losses in Thursday's local elections would be compounded if Labour has indeed formed a secret 'Rainbow Alliance' with the Liberal Democrats to maximise their local advantages. In his letter to Sir Keir, Mr Dowden said: 'I note that in the South West, you are standing candidates in 61 per cent of seats compared to 97 per cent in 2018. And in the South East there is a similar pattern with Labour standing candidates in 88 per cent of seats compared to 99 per cent in 2018. 'In the North of England it appears that the Liberal Democrats are returning the favour. In the North East they are standing in just 56 per cent of seats, down from 78 per cent four years ago. Labour are, however, standing in 99 per cent of seats in the area. These shifts are far too substantial to be a mere coincidence... It now appears that your plans to deny the voters a proper democratic choice are coming to fruition.' Mr Dowden asks Sir Keir to explain 'when Labour and the Liberal Democrats agreed to this pact', whether 'party members and MPs in the affected regions [were] consulted about the pact' and finally: 'Why have you attempted to conceal this from the voters?' Mr Dowden stepped in after campaigners in the North East reported that 'Labour are pushing hard up here, but the Lib Dems are nowhere', while in the South West 'Labour have completely vanished'. An official said: 'It was pretty obvious what was going on - Labour and the Lib Dems had done some sort of deal'. Last night, a Labour spokesperson said: 'We are in the business of winning elections with Labour candidates driven by Labour values.' A party source added: 'There will be no deals and no pacts. Labour only wins power when we squeeze other progressive parties and win over Tories.' A Liberal Democrat source said: 'From porn to Partygate, the Tories have had a disastrous local elections campaign, so it's no surprise they've resorted to making things up. The Lib Dems are one seat away from taking Labour-controlled Hull and are fighting a full slate in places like Newcastle, Gateshead and Manchester. 'This is a concocted story by a party that is desperate to distract from their terrible record on the cost of living, crime and local health services.'",
  "221e9fcee0fc86b0e688379c8e176238f89371e056978ec042467875": "A star college running back-turned-California cop died of a fentanyl overdose last month, the local coroner has revealed. De'Jon Packer, a 24-year-old rookie with the San Jose Police Department and former college football star, was found unresponsive during a welfare check at his Milpitas home on March 13.  He was pronounced dead on the scene by firefighters and his fellow officers. The Santa Clara County Medical Examiner confirmed he died of 'fentanyl toxicity,' according to NBC Bay Area, despite his family arguing that 'he was heavily against' illicit drugs. His death now remains under investigation by Milpitas police amid allegations that he had partied with other police officers the night before. San Jose Police Chief Anthony Mata said his department is cooperating with the Milpitas investigation, adding that it does not condone drug use. He said the department is now offering substance abuse prevention training for its officers as well as emotional support services. 'We need to be mindful of the fact that we are not immune to issues that plague society, in this case substance abuse,' he said in a statement to NBC Bay Area. 'As humans, we are not perfect, and mistakes will be made.'  In a statement, Packer's family said they were shocked an heartbroken upon learning of his cause of death, saying there was no evidence he was involved in illicit drugs 'and he was heavily against it, as evidenced by his chosen profession,' family spokesperson Patrice Barrera told Mercury News. 'It is our understanding that even the smallest trace of fentanyl is lethal and can cause harm, and our family is following the Milpitas Police Department's investigation of the circumstances surrounding his death.' She added that Packer 'joined the San Jose Police Department to make a difference in his community. 'Above all things De'Jon was special, brought good to the world and left a positive impact everywhere he went and on everyone he met,' Barrera said. 'That is his legacy, not this.'  The night before Packer's death, sources with direct knowledge of the case told NBC Bay Area he was at a party with fellow police officers. Those sources said the officers involved could face an internal investigation, and added that a criminal probe may also be in the works. In his statement, Mata said 'any allegations of illegal drug use by a San Jose police officer is concerning. 'There are no free passes for police officers, and we will not make excuses,' he said, noting: 'When an officer violates the public trust, on or off duty, I will hold them accountable. I have stated  that since the day I took the oath of leading this great agency as Chief of Police. 'The public demands, and I expect, ethical behavior, accountability and professionalism from all who wear the uniform. 'I will continue to ensure we keep the trust of the City, and the community members we serve,' Mata vowed. Packer had just finished his first year on the police force when he had died. Prior to that, he had played three seasons as a running back for San Jose State University and scored the winning touchdown in the school's underdog victory against the Arkansas Razorbacks in 2019.  Following the news of his , the San Jose State University football team put out a statement saying  'the San Jose State Football family has suffered a great loss,' and coach Brent Brennan said: 'We all love De'Jon Packer and we will miss his infectious smile.' He told NBC Bay Area: 'He had this big smile, and was one of the most well-liked guys on our team,' adding that he was 'just a really, really special young man and was in such a great place in his life.'  Hundreds of Spartan football players, San Jose police officers and friends and family gathered for his funeral on March 26, when Mayor Sam Liccardo eulogized Packer, saying 'His impact was far and wide.'

UK officials, including a Border Force vessel, escorted seven small boats of men, women and children into Dover Harbour, Kent, at around 12.30am. The last migrants to arrive at Dover in Kent were a total of 263 across seven small boats on April 19 - and Ministry of Justice data revealed not a single adult or child made it across since.  It comes amid a new strategy to deal with Channel migrants launched on April 14 which saw the military take charge of attempts to control crossings with a joint task force drawn from the Navy, Army and Air Force in Kent.  This week, Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen said that the drop to zero was evidence that Home Secretary Priti Patel's scheme, which will see asylum seekers sent 4,000 miles to claim refugee status from Rwanda, is 'working already'. The controversial agreement with the East African nation, which will see it receive asylum seekers deemed by the UK to have arrived 'illegally' and therefore inadmissible under new immigration rules, was signed on April 14. Mr Bridgen, the MP for North West Leicestershire, tweeted: 'Priti's migrant policy is working already. No illegal migrant crossing for a week and no income for people traffickers, freeing up civil servants to work on Ukrainian evacuees. We should offer the illegal migrants already here the option of returning to France or going to Rwanda.' But former Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage told GB News: 'There are some saying Rwanda is working, it's a success because virtually no migrants have come now for the last six or seven days. Believe you me, I know this subject. 'That is nothing to do with the prospect of being shipped off to Rwanda. It's because there has been a persistent, strong, north-easterly wind in the English Channel. When it gets calm again, the boats will continue to come.' Up to 300 military servicemen, Navy ships and surveillance drones are being deployed to the Channel after the Armed Forces took control with the Navy assuming Border Force's responsibility for intercepting migrant boats. An RAF Wildcat helicopter is now the key military asset in the air and is being used to carry out a final 'sweep' of the Channel at the end of each day to ensure all migrants - and their dinghies - have been recovered. The helicopter is being aided by RAF drones operated out of Lydd Airport in Kent. Soldiers and airmen are also now being based at Dover to help UK Border Force staff with initial processing, and the military are able to issue directions to civilian staff of the UK Border Force, whose ships are remaining part of the Channel taskforce. Seven ships including HMS Tyne, plus smaller boats and a helicopter are being made available to patrol the sea and coastline, so Border Force staff can be freed up for processing migrants once they arrive on land. More than 6,500 migrants are thought to have arrived in the UK this year so far after crossing the Channel. In 2021 some 28,526 migrants reached UK shores aboard dinghies and small boats - up from 8,417 in 2020. The total number of migrants arriving so far this month has been 2,143 across 58 small boats, although the final day of arrivals to the present date was on April 19 when 263 were intercepted across seven small boats.   In March this year, 3,066 people made the crossing. That was nearly four times the amount recorded for the same month in 2021 (831) and more than 16 times the amount for 2020 (187). It was also the fourth highest monthly total recorded since the start of 2020, behind July (3,510), September (4,652) and November (6,869) last year. The figures for April 2022 mean the total number of migrants to arrive so far this year is 6,693 across 204 boats. Some 1,425 of these had made it across since the Royal Navy took over control of migrant operations in the Channel on April 14. Earlier this month,  the UK's former Border Force chief Tony Smith told the Daily Mail that more than 100,000 Channel migrants will reach Britain this year. Backing the Government's asylum deal with Rwanda, Mr Smith said: 'There comes a point where we need to get a grip of our border and stop the boats. 'The numbers are going up, a fourfold increase already this year - 28,500 last year,' he added. 'That's going to be over 100,000 this year just by migrant boats alone.' Mr Smith's prediction would be nearly 12 times the level seen in 2020, 54 times that of 2019 and more than 300 times that in 2018. In January, it emerged that the Home Office had produced official papers warning that 65,000 migrants could cross this year.  A Government spokesperson said: 'The rise in dangerous Channel crossings is unacceptable. Not only are they an overt abuse of our immigration laws but they also impact on the UK taxpayer, risk lives and our ability to help refugees come to the UK via safe and legal routes. 'This week, the Nationality and Borders Act completed its passage through Parliament.  'Through this landmark legislation, the Government is cracking down on people smugglers and fixing the broken system by making it a criminal offence to knowingly arrive in the UK illegally and introducing a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for those who facilitate illegal entry into our country.'",
  "5c5cf66d8e36f4033dd29d1e3a06577b0070e22c515c7dcac04a244a": "An elite Sydney girls' school has banned students from using their phones at school after teachers flagged concerns over students being distracted by their phones during class. Teachers at SCEGGS in Darlinghurst say students have become more dependent and distracted by their phones, with many noting a significant increase in device usage in class following last year's lockdown. SCEGGS Darlinghurst is the latest school to impose restrictions on students using phones or electronic devices after Shore School banned students from bringing their own laptops to class last month. SCEGGS Darlinghurst implemented the ban on mobile devices when several teachers raised the issue with school leaders.  The school's principal, Jenny Allum, later issued a letter to parents announcing the ban and the reasoning behind it.  Ms Allum explained that teachers were concerned by a 'seeming increase in students' distracted on their phones as they were trying to conduct lessons.  She also pointed towards students becoming too dependent on their devices.  Ms Allum told The Sydney Morning Herald: 'This seems particularly so after the COVID lockdowns, but perhaps [it is] for other reasons too.' This decision by SCEGGS comes just a month after all-boys private school Shore School banned students from bringing their own laptops to class. Shore School - which charges $37,350 a year for Year 12 tuition - initially allowed students to bring their own devices to class for their education under a Bring Your Own Device policy. But the prestigious, single-sex Anglican college backflipped and introduced a ban after many boys became increasingly distracted by gambling, porn, social media and streaming sites instead of focusing on their teachers.  The school's principal Timothy Petterson listed classroom distraction as one of the main reasons for the policy change and told parents the BYO policy was only 'sub-optimal to the learning of students.'  Teachers conceded at an information night for students last month that issues had arisen since boys at the school started to bring their own devices to class. A former student who graduated from Shore School last year penned an article for the school's newsletter elaborating on just how frequent laptop misuse amongst his peers was.  'Students are gambling, gaming, scrolling through social media, watching Netflix, purchasing things on eBay, video conferencing with their friends and viewing pornography all while their teacher is addressing them,' he said. 'I am five weeks out from the trial HSC in one of the top classes and this is still happening every single day.'  The author wrote that 'fewer than half of the students in most of my classes are paying full attention to teachers, with most staring blankly at their laptops'. He recalled how one teacher had to stop his class 'every 10 minutes' to tell students to look up and pay attention. The school is currently rolling out a new policy where boys will 'rent out' laptops with built-in controls instead of bringing their own devices. Teachers have also been trained to be aware of device misuse in class. Bans and restrictions on mobile phones and laptops has become a divisive issue amongst schools and educators. Last year, NSW clarified rules for primary and high schools following a review of phone use in schools. 'The new policy includes the digital device restriction for primary schools announced by the NSW Government in December 2018 in response to the review,' the department said. 'Under the new policy, secondary schools retain discretion to opt into the restriction or implement an approach that best suits their circumstances and the needs of their diverse communities.'",
  "624495af286a29575d1359d52cb89b685168c56d3e028bd9f523d928": "Seven shocking reasons have been put forward in court detailing why a driver who killed four children and injured three others in Sydney's horror Oatlands crash must serve his full sentence. Prosecutors detailed how Samuel Davidson, drunk and high on drugs, sped through a red light, drove on the wrong side of the road and forced a motorbike to swerve before mounting a footpath on February 1, 2020 and mowing down seven children walking to an ice-cream shop in a crime that shocked Australia. Davidson was sentenced to 28 years in jail for his crime but now claims his sentence is 'crushing' and he deserves to have it slashed by more than a half because he's sorry and his ADHD is making prison life difficult.    Appearing via video link from Hunter maximum security prison on Monday, Davidson sat in prison greens and a face mask, staring straight ahead as his barrister Stephen Odgers QC described his 'good character'. 'He was a 29-year-old with no significant driving offences, had never driven while intoxicated before, was appropriately remorseful and his ADHD will make his imprisonment more onerous,' Mr Odgers said.  He argued that Davidson's maximum 28 year sentence with a minimum 21 years expiring when he turned 51 should instead be slashed to a minimum of eight years and four months. This would mean Davidson walking from prison in 2029 after serving seven more years for four counts of manslaughter, one count of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm and two of bodily harm by misconduct. But Davidson's appeal before Justices Paul Brereton, Christine Adamson and Natalie Adams, also heard shocking details of the wild behaviour he engaged in before he committed the offences.  Crown prosecutor David Kell SC argued he had gone off his ADHD medication on several occasions before the tragedy and had binged on alcohol and illicit drugs.   Driving while drunk and after taking cocaine and MDMA, Davidson killed Veronique Sakr, 11, and her cousins, the Abdallah siblings, Sienna, eight, Angelina, 12, and Antony, 13. He also injured three children, causing one boy permanent brain damage.     Davidson's lawyer argued that despite multiple victims, the offences had been caused by just a single act and that his ADHD made him drink to excess and his impulsivity had then made him get behind the wheel.  However, Mr Kell said that among the 'unique' circumstances of this 'exceptional' case taken into account at sentencing included the fact Davidson had been diagnosed with ADHD aged five, and had periodically ceased medication for the condition and binged on alcohol and drugs. He said this 'history of being on and off ADHD medication' was Davidson's own 'choice'.  Mr Kell said the shocking details of Davidson's  criminal conduct could be summed up in a series of seven different ways leading up to the tragedy. .   1. On February 1, 2020, after drinking the night before, Samuel Davidson starting drinking at 7am and continued until about 7.30pm , also taking cocaine and MDMA. 2. After leaving on what would be a total journey of 5.4km, Davidson 'exited a petrol station at speed and sped through a red light'. 3.  He then 'engaged in menacing driving' half a metre driving behind a woman with two children on board, who could see him 'shirtless and laughing' as he 'swerved from side-to-side'. 4.  Then drove on wrong side of road, overtook a car and drove round a roundabout in the wrong direction, anti-clockwise. 5. Stuck up his middle finger at a witness who saw him laughing and caused a motorbike to swerve sharply towards the gutter. 6. Accelerated through a red light and then crossed over four lanes on Pennant Hills Road, Oatlands. 7. In a 50kph zone on Bettingdon Road, drove up to 125kph, then at 133kph approached a bend and lost control, mounting the footpath and striking the children, killing four and injuring three. For up to 5 second s beforehand, he did not engage his brake pedal, and afterwards travelled a further 90m on the footpath before hitting a road sign.    On a wild ride which continued for a total of 5.3km ride, he exited a petrol station at speed and then sped through a red light. He then engaged in 'menacing driving' by driving close to rear of another driver's vehicle, about half a metre behind and swerved from side-to-side to get past the car. 'The other driver had two children in her car, and in her rear view mirror could see Davidson and his passenger shirtless and laughing. Davidson then drove on the incorrect side of the road and overtook another car.  'STUCK UP HIS MIDDLE FINGER'  He then drove around a roundabout in the wrong direction, anti-clockwise, and a witness observed him laughing as he stuck up his middle finger and caused a motor bike to swerve sharply towards a gutter. Next, Davidson accelerated through a red light on Pennant Hills Road and across four traffic lanes.  Travelling south on Bettingdon Road, he clocked up a speed of between 122kph and 125kph in what was a 50kph zone. When he approached a right hand bend, he was travelling up to 133kph, and owing to his excessive speed, he entered the bend in road and lost control of his vehicle. Mounting the kerb and footpath he struck the Abdallah children and their cousin, killing four  and injuring three, one critically. Analysis of his vehicle later proved that during the five seconds before striking the children, his brake pedal was not engaged once. 'After striking all seven children, the vehicle travelled a further 90m on the footpath before colliding with a road sign before changing direction to the other side of the road,' the court heard. At sentencing, Judge James Bennett said 'tragedy was inevitable' but that 'the magnitude of the tragedy, though, unimaginable'. 'DEVASTATION OF FAMILIES'  At the appeal hearing Justice Brereton said it was 'the devastation' to the families of the victims and the community which had resulted in a lengthy sentence for Davidson. He said it was important 'to recognise the the dignity of each of the victims' in making the length of the sentence fit the punishment. Davidson is two-and-a-half years into his sentence and is not expected to be eligible for parole until 2041.    Both the Abdullah children's parents Danny and Leila and Sakr families have shown remarkable grace in the wake of the horrific incident, with Danny saying said he forgave Davidson 'for your sake, for my sake, and most importantly for my family's sake'. But he also said at the time of Davidson's sentencing that it did not matter whether he received one year or 100 years, 'we won't get Antony, Angelina, Sienna and Veronique back'.  'We will all have our hearts broken until the day we take our last breath and no sentence can help ease that pain.'  Judge Bennett acknowledged Davidson suffered from ADHD but did not accept impulsivity that day caused him to drive, seen in his consciousness of guilt immediately after the crash. Justice Brereton told the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal at the end of Monday's hearing  that the three judges would reserve their decision which will be published at a later date.",
  "2d7f3e124fa900fe981f0facc7887afc13ed39b62cbf054aeb217b5e": "A Labor politician's controversial tweets have emerged where she describes Jesus as 'gay', denies Sydney's Lindt cafe siege was a terrorist attack and tells the Pope to 'get your head out of your a***'.  Mich-Elle Myers, the party's number five pick on the NSW Senate ticket and a friend of Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese, shut down her social media profile as the cache of bizarre messages emerged.  But it came too late - with the tweets surfacing on Monday, three weeks out before the Federal election.  In one message, supplied to Daily Mail Australia, Ms Myers weighed in on the 2014 Lindt Cafe Siege when extremist Man Haron Monis held 18 people hostage for 17 hours before killing two of them. The Labor candidate took to Twitter in 2016 to deny it was a terror attack - despite an inquest later declaring it was one. 'Martin Place was NOT a terror attack! Stop spreading the fear!' she tweeted. 'The nutcase in the cafe wasn't a terrorist he was a nutcase with a gun that killed innocent people.'  Ms Myers has also been critical of the Catholic Church, dropping a series of controversial messages about religion in 2013. 'Jesus was gay! You heard it here first,' read one of them.  Another read: 'I've had enough of the catholic (sic) church & the sh*t that comes from their mouths'.  The Labor candidate had also tweeted for the Pope to 'get your head out of your a***'.  Ms Myers also broke ranks from her Labor colleagues to also slam the AUKUS agreement signed between Australia, the United Kingdom and United States in November 2021.  'The news about nuclear subs and defence deals (sic) has made me feel sick,' she tweeted.  Ms Myers was also a close friend of CFMEU Secretary John Setka before he was kicked out of the Labor Party and convicted of harassing his wife in 2019. 'Why are these thugs so happy? Because we are one! (We won!)' Ms Myers captioned a photo of her and Mr Setka in 2018. NSW Senator Hollie Hughes slammed the tweets saying they did not belong in parliament. 'It says many things about Mr Albanese's weak leadership that he thinks these views are acceptable in the Senate,' she said.  Ms Myers said she regretted the tweets and apologised for any offence they might have caused.  'Ms Myers has apologised for her past comments. They do not reflect Labor's views,' an ALP spokesman said.  Daily Mail Australia contacted Ms Myers for comment. ",
  "2347536f80dc911c4816f9bcc65aef4ef03e07ab001cfc04f4bce56f": "Annastacia Palaszczuk has faced backlash after she unexpectedly invited her boyfriend to a key meeting with the International Olympic Committee and Brisbane Olympics organisers. The Queensland premier's partner, surgeon Reza Adib, joined the premier for the meeting at the Solotel in Sydney on Sunday. He can be seen in several pictures amongst officials, including IOC president Thomas Bach, outgoing and new Australian Olympic Committee presidents John Coates and Ian Chesterman, Brisbane Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner, and the boss of the Brisbane 2032 organising committee, Andrew Liveris. Questions have been raised as to why Dr Adib tagged along in the first place, with the Deputy Opposition Leader Jarrod Bleijie describing the scenario as 'weird' and 'not appropriate'. 'I've just got to say, it's just a bit weird, the whole thing is weird,' Mr Bleijie said on Monday at a press conference. 'No one else had their partners at the meeting.' 'It was a properly-prepared, formal meeting with very important people and the Premier's boyfriend was at the table.' 'So I'm just saying, I looked at it, and I just think, why was the Premier's boyfriend granted a position at the table? He shouldn't have been there.' A spokesperson for the premier downplayed the serious nature of the Olympics meeting, stating it was simply an 'informal catch-up'. The Courier Mail has revealed that Dr Adib's name was not included on an official attendee list for the meeting. Sunday's meeting saw an official slogan for the Games unveiled, which was agreed upon between officials. IOC President Thomas Bach told the press the slogan was 'Have a go!' The meeting also publicly farewelled long-serving AOC President, John Coates. News of the Queensland Premier's relationship with Mr Adib was only revealed last year. Ms Palaszczuk confirmed the relationship with The Courier-Mail in September, describing him as a 'very warm and caring, intelligent man with a great sense of humour'. Political sources said the pair's relationship had only blossomed in the preceding months. Ms Palaszczuk was first pictured with the dashing Dr Adib at the Caloundra Cup at the Sunshine Coast Turf Club on July 11 last year, leading to speculation the pair were romantically linked. In one photograph, the father of two had his arm around the smiling premier as she leaned in towards him on the course rail. In another they were seated together at a table inside. The Premier has previously said her personal life had fallen by the wayside as a result of her political career and that her busy schedule made looking for love almost impossible.",
  "a5a2bbc261a92a32a7773ac049db925131869549edee751c5857afdc": "Family members of Scott Johnson whose body was found at the bottom of a Manly cliff in 1988 have spoken of the horror, terror, tragedy and heartbreak that the past 34 years have brought. Mr Johnson's sister Terry Johnson said Scott White, who pleaded guilty to the murder in January this year, had taken away decades from her brother's life. 'The hateful person who killed Scott has been walking free on this earth for the past 33 years. Thirty-three years that he took away from my baby brother. I believe [White] deserves life in prison.' With White looking on from the NSW Supreme Court dock wearing his prison greens, sister Rebecca Johnson talked about how society in the 1980s had also let down teenagers who thought violence against gay men was acceptable. 'Parents, brothers and sisters, teachers and classmates, authority, culture, somehow Mr White's world reinforced that violence and even killing was OK and maybe that gay men weren't human. That is a profound tragedy,' she said on Monday. Ms Johnson questioned why her brother, an American mathematician, was placed in the crosshairs of deadly violence and murder simply for who he chose to love. Brother Steve Johnson described the death as being too huge and awful to be true, saying his mother had reacted with a wailing cry at the news. 'The wailing is a reliving, it's a howl of death and despair and loss and grief that signifies that a piece of us has departed. It never goes away.' Scott Johnson's partner Michael Noone also gave a statement describing the sheer horror of receiving a call from the police about the death of a loved one. These victim statements were heard after White's former partner Helen White took the stand and described a conversation with her ex-husband in December 1998 about his 'poofter bashing' of the 1980s. 'He said the only good poofter is a dead poofter, to which I said, 'So you threw him off the cliff'. And he said, 'It's not my fault the dumb c*** ran off the cliff',' she said. Ms White denied suggestions by White's barrister Belinda Rigg SC that she had only gone to the police because of a $1 million reward offered in 2018 for information about Mr Johnson's death, and rejected claims she had made up the conversations with her then husband. Ms Rigg argued that White should receive a lesser sentence because he had only turned 18 at the time, saying that sentences for murder were significantly lower in the late 1980s and early 1990s. White's intellectual impairments meant he had suffered stress, anxiety and panic attacks while in custody. During the 1980s, White was a gay man who had lived with his homophobic brother and alcoholic parents, Ms Rigg told Justice Helen Wilson. The prosecution pointed to the seriousness of the offence, saying it was targeted towards the victim's sexuality. 'This was a grave and serious murder which entailed a high degree of criminality,' the crown prosecutor said. In January, White pleaded guilty to murder before his defence team unsuccessfully tried to reverse the plea. An appeal of White's conviction was filed last month. While the initial police inquest in 1989 found Mr Johnson's death was a suicide, the case was reopened in 2012. Another inquest returned an open finding in June 2012, but a third in 2017 found Mr Johnson fell from the clifftops as a result of violence by an unidentified attacker who perceived him to be gay. Justice Wilson will hand down her sentence on Tuesday.",
  "22e4690d7ed32a3744536fa66621545445dfd6258dac7a8d64bb5c20": "Incredible footage has captured the moment a truck narrowly avoided slamming into the back of a car before jack-knifing across a major highway. Dashcam video captured last week shows how an unmarked truck, travelling along Sydney's M5, nearly rear-ended a car - before swerving across the freeway.  'I can't believe that he missed everything on the road.,' the dashcam owner said. 'He then drove away 15 minutes later. It frightened me.'  Scroll down for the video.  Fortunately no one was injured in the incident.  Some commenters were quick to criticise the truck driver's judgement. 'Another cowboy (truckie), probably the worst and most dangerous drivers on the road,' one person wrote.  'The only way you could partially excuse the truck for slow reaction is if the dash cam car's brake lights were out,' another said.  'Why are there so many people looking at these accidents, and thinking it's funny. Bet they wouldn't be laughing if it was them or their family member,' another wrote.  However other commenters jumped to the defence of the truck driver and accused the dashcam owner of slowing down too quickly. 'Camera car slowed dramatically, it was evident because ALL the traffic behind caught up suddenly. Looks like the camera car braked at the bridge, as if they were approaching the speed camera. Poor truckie had the fright of his life,' one commenter said. 'Hats off to the truck driver for not hurting another soul in the process. Why did they slow down really quickly? Maintaining a safe following distance till the point the car braked quickly,' another wrote.",
  "1441d281ab3ca7acbaf9d98a6cf6a5e9b78143157c4e52dbdd7fb066": "Qantas has announced it will commence direct non-stop flights from Sydney to London and New York from 2025. The routes will officially be the longest passenger flights in the world, with the journey taking 19 hours. The airline had already launched a non-stop flight between Perth and London in 2018, which took a similarly epic 17 hours to complete for the bleary-eyed first passengers on board. The airline has also announced it has bought 12 new Airbus A350-1000s to operate the routes to 'conquer the final frontier of long-haul travel and enable non-stop flights from Sydney and Melbourne to cities including New York and London from late 2025.' Qantas has also shared preliminary concepts for its A350 'cabin of the future' featuring a wellbeing zone' offering an area where travellers can stretch and exercise with complimentary water, fruit and snack bars. The first-class suites will include a private area with door, a full-size flat-screen TV, a separate bed, a recliner lounge chair, and a personal wardrobe for the cashed-up. 'Our direct Perth-London flights started in 2017 and showed strong demand for the convenience and time savings from this kind of travel if the product and service is right,' CEO Alan Joyce said. 'Pre-COVID it was the longest route on our network and had the highest customer satisfaction on our network.' The first 'Project Sunrise' flights will be from New York and London, but the aircraft will also be able to operate non-stop flights to Australia from destinations such as Paris and Frankfurt. Qantas will also renew its narrow-body jets as part of Project Winton with firm orders for 20 Airbus A321XLRs, and 20 A220-300s as its Boeing 737s and 717s are gradually retired. The first of these aircraft will start to arrive in late 2023, with the order including purchase right options for another 94 aircraft for delivery through to at least 2034. These aircraft will start flying domestic routes as soon as they arrive. In 2018, before Covid firmly halted international travel, the first passengers on board the inaugural Qantas non-stop 17-hour flight from Perth to London shared their in-flight experience after the historic Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner landed at London's Heathrow airport. The 17 hour and 20-minute journey on a plane called Emily ended a few minutes ahead of schedule at 5.02 am on Sunday after travelling 9,000 miles without stopping. Self-proclaimed 'aviation geek' Wayne Kwong was a passenger in the economy section for the 17-hour flight and shared several photos on social media detailing his journey. He shared photos of the menu, uploading an image of a chicken breast accompanied by a glass of wine. 'Specially designed meals for this ultra-long-haul flight. Tasty, filling but not heavy on your stomach! Well done Qantas,' he wrote. The legroom was spacious, and there was a 'lovely retro pillow' to help prevent knee injuries for taller passengers, Mr Kwong said. The aircraft is twice as fuel-efficient as the Boeing 747, has lower cabin noise, larger windows, improved air quality and technology to reduce turbulence. Passengers on board shared photos of the specially crafted menu, complimentary amenity bags and the self-serve pantry, loaded with free snacks and drinks. The flight was 24 per cent further than the UK's previous longest route, operated by Garuda Indonesia between Heathrow and Jakarta, which is just 7,275 miles in comparison. The inaugural trip took off with more than 200 passengers and 16 crew members, and those on board began the journey with a round of applause. The plane had 42 business class flat-bed seats, 28 premium economy seats and 166 economy seats.  Passengers were greeted with complimentary amenity bags, which included a sleeping mask, ear buds, a Qantas fleece blanket and a toothbrush.    Dinner offerings included cheese ravioli with leek and mushroom cream sauce; and chicken with red rice and roasted Mediterranean vegetables.  The meals were designed to maintain hydration, aid sleep and reduce jet lag, according to the airline. But to the dismay of many, free WiFi was not available on the flight so passengers were not able to detail every moment of their trip.  Another frequent complaint was the lack of legroom. According to business class passenger Robert Williamson, a mining executive from Perth, the flight was 'was surprisingly good -- above my expectation', he told the Independent.   But economy passenger Peter Robinson, a builder from Liverpool, begged to differ.  He said the specially crafted food items were bland and 'ordinary', but admitted the flight was 'good, quicker than I thought.' Although passengers on-board the long haul flight gave it fairly positive reviews, others were skeptical it was as smooth sailing as described. Most were concerned they wouldn't be able to walk or feel their behinds after spending more than half a day glued to their seats.  Others drew on their experiences of flying for 12 hours as cause to never subject themselves to 17 hours on a plane, while some were upset that the non-stop flight meant no cigarettes.  After being parked at Heathrow for eight hours, the plane was scheduled to turn right back around to Perth for another non-stop 17-hour flight for a second run. Qantas Group CEO Alan Joyce, who was one of the passengers on the inaugural flight, described it as a major milestone for Australia as well as global aviation. He said: 'This is a truly historic flight that opens up a new era of travel. For the first time, Australia and Europe have a direct air link. 'The original Kangaroo Route from Australia to London was named for the seven stops it made over four days back in 1947. Now we can do it in a single leap. 'The response to the flight has been amazing, both for the attention it's received since we announced it and the bookings we've seen coming in. It's great for Australian tourism, for business travellers and for people visiting friends and family on both sides of the world.' Mr Joyce said a huge amount of work had gone into improving the experience for customers taking the 17-hour journey. He added: 'This is hands-down the most comfortable aircraft that Qantas has ever put in the sky. 'Boeing designed the Dreamliner with features to reduce jetlag, turbulence and noise. We've taken that a step further with our cabin design, giving passengers more space in every class as well as bigger entertainment screens and more personal storage. 'We've worked with the University of Sydney and our consulting chef Neil Perry to create a menu that helps the body cope better with jetlag and adjusted the timing of when we serve food to encourage sleep.' EXCLUSIVE On board the RETURN flight to Perth: Traveller on the first direct service from the UK to Australia reveals he felt so lively on landing that 'it almost felt like a trick' By Jonathan Thompson  And just like that, Emily arrived in Australia. This morning, at 12.40pm local time (5.40am BST) the first ever direct flight from London to Australia landed in Perth, making aviation history. Qantas' Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner - nicknamed 'Emily' - touched down to no little fanfare in Australia's sunniest city. Fire trucks ceremoniously squirted water cannons, a crowd cheered and TV crews recorded 236 blinking passengers stepping off the historic flight and into the embers of Australian summer, all looking surprisingly lively. And I felt genuinely relaxed (though the business class seat helped, admittedly).  Our journey had taken just 16 hours and 30 minutes (15 minutes ahead of schedule) but it had been years in the making - the fruits of a decade of dedicated seasonal air pattern analysis for starters, and Qantas is justifiably proud to have finally achieved it. Not only will the journey between the UK and Australia now be significantly shorter (four hours less than the next shortest flight, via Dubai), it will also be noticeably more comfortable aboard the Boeing Dreamliner. This sleek, parabolic panther of an aircraft boasts multiple advantages over its rivals, including softer cabin noise, larger windows, anti-turbulence technology, improved air quality and more space in every cabin. It's all designed to lessen jet lag - and it appears to work. Dignitaries, business professionals, reuniting families, journalists and a smattering of celebrities - comedian Adam Hills and actress Gemma Atkinson were among those disembarking Qantas Flight 10 - all looked remarkably energetic considering they'd just travelled 9,009 miles from the other side of the planet. And I felt refreshed and raring to go. The Dreamliner definitely makes a difference. It almost felt like a trick - like I couldn't really be in Australia, because I hadn't earned it. But ultimately I'm not complaining. It has gone from a full day flight to an overnight flight - psychologically more akin to a trip to California now.  The most senior of the plane's four pilots - the affable Captain Andrew Simpson - was also full of beans, and understandably upbeat after completing such a momentous flight. 'This is absolutely fantastic, a real game changer for the world of aviation,' he said. 'For the first time, Australia and Europe have a direct air link, and that is a big deal. It's a major honour and extremely humbling for me to be at the pointy end of this particular plane.' Our journey itself was almost ludicrously smooth - the seatbelt sign did not flicker on even once, with the only remotely rough patch of air experienced a few hundred miles north of the Maldives, before the Dreamliner tore away across the Indian Ocean. There were some nice touches with regards to the on-board service too: every passenger's plastic water bottle was refilled, never replaced, while all of the meals had been specifically designed by chef Neil Perry, in consultation with experts from The Charles Perkins Centre at Sydney University, to stave off jetlag. Back at London Heathrow's Terminal 3, our take off had been marked in style too, with actors dressed as kangaroos and surfers, and a giant of a man playing us aboard with an enormous didgeridoo. Even our boarding passes bore the legend 'Congratulations! You are boarding the first non-stop UK-AUS flight.' Travelling in this fashion is light years ahead of the original London-Australia flight - the infamous 'Kangaroo Route' - which began in 1947. That four-day intercontinental hopscotch - involving seven stops and costing the equivalent of more than PS24,000 today - has now become a seamless, non-stop 17-hour zip Down Under. (It's significantly cheaper in real terms too, with tickets for this London-Perth route starting at just PS793 per person return in economy). The route officially becomes the longest anywhere in the world from London (a massive 24 per cent longer than the previous record holder, from Heathrow to Jakarta) and the first ever direct air connection between the continents of Europe and Australasia. There's still room for improvement of course. No Wifi on the history-making QF10 is an issue - particularly as British Airways has introduced it to many of its own long-haul flights in recent weeks. And Qantas remains agonisingly short of Qatar Airway's current world record for the longest commercial flight on Earth: 9,028 miles between Doha and Auckland. One gets the impression that record won't stand for too long, however. Qantas already have their eyes on a non-stop London to Sydney flight by 2022, with New York-Sydney potentially coming even earlier. For now, all eyes are on the historic achievement of QF10 but ultimately, success on the London-Perth service is just the beginning. 1. QF9 is operated by four pilots across the 17-hour journey, with one or two pilots resting at any one time. 2. The flight will follow different flight paths depending on the best winds, helping the aircraft fly faster and more efficiently. Qantas analysed a decade of seasonal wind patterns in preparation for the new service. 3. At 14,498km, QF9 is the third longest commercial flight currently in operation. It is the world's longest Dreamliner flight. 4. QF9 will carry around 92 tonnes or 110,000 litres of fuel with the Dreamliner burning approximately 20 per cent less than traditional aircraft its size. 5. With a total seat count of 236 passengers, the Qantas Dreamliner has significantly fewer seats than many other airlines who have configured the same aircraft to carry more than 300 passengers. 6. Currently, most aircraft have cabin air pressure equivalent to that of an altitude of 8,000 ft. For the Dreamliner, Boeing cut that down to 6,000 ft, meaning its closer to conditions on the ground. 7. Menus for the flights between Perth and London have been designed to maintain hydration, aid sleep and reducing jetlag and including poke bowls as well as home style comfort food. 8. There are more than 21,000 individual items loaded onto the aircraft for each flight between Perth and London including 330 peppermint tea bags and hundreds of chocolate biscuits. 9. In 1947 a return flight from Sydney to London cost PS525 when the average wage was PS7. Today, the average Australian weekly wage is $1600 and a return fare from Perth to London can cost less than $1300.  ",

The Microsoft founder, 65, first met Epstein in 2011 after the financier had been convicted of soliciting sex from a minor in 2008. Epstein was also invited to fundraising dinners that promoted the Gates Foundation. 'At the time, I didn't realize that by having those meetings it would be seen as giving him credibility,' Gates told The Times in an interview Sunday. 'You're almost saying, 'I forgive that type of behavior,' or something. So clearly the way it's seen, I made a huge mistake not understanding that.' The dinners were a point of contention between the Microsoft billionaire and his now ex-wife and business partner, Melinda French Gates, who described Epstein as 'evil personified.' The couple announced their separation last year after 27 years of marriage. In earlier interviews, Gates stated how he ultimately stopped meetings with the convicted sex offender after he realized the meetings would not be productive for his philanthropic foundation. 'I had dinners with him. I regret doing that. He had relationships he said with people he said would give to public health. Not nearly enough philanthropy goes in that direction,' Gates said in a September 2021 interview.  'Those meetings were a mistake. They didn't result in what he purported, and I cut them off. You know, that goes back a long time ago now,' he said to PBS. The billionaire has previously claimed he had concerns about Epstein, who had pleaded guilty and was convicted in 2008 of procuring a child for prostitution and of soliciting a prostitute - years before the tech mogul met the financier.   'I had several dinners with him hoping that what he said about getting billions of philanthropy for global health through contacts he had might emerge. When it looked like that wasn't a real thing that relationship ended,' Gates said.    'It was a huge mistake to spend time with him and give him the credibility of being there. There were lots of others in that same situation, but I made a mistake.' Gates has been reported to have visited Epstein's home numerous times and even talked with him about his 'toxic' marriage while the pedophile allegedly gave him advice on ending his marriage, according to the Daily Beast.  Gates' visits to Epstein's 'lair' were an escape from his unhappy marriage, and the pair 'were very close', a source said. Flight records also reveal that Gates flew with Epstein on the so-called Lolita Express from Teterboro Airport in New Jersey to Palm Beach on March 1, 2013, one of the few flights that year where pilot Larry Viskoski recorded the name of a passenger.  In her first interview since her divorce from the billionaire last year, Melinda told CBS Mornings in March that she insisted on meeting Epstein back in 2011 because she wanted to see 'who this man was'.  'I did not like that he had meetings with Jeffrey Epstein. I made that clear to him. I also met Jeffrey Epstein exactly one time. I wanted to see who this man was and I regretted it from the second I stepped in the door.  'He was abhorrent, evil personified. I had nightmares about it afterwards. That's why my heart breaks for these young women. That's how I felt, and I am an older woman. He was awful.'  She told how Bill had to answer for the many times he met Epstein, and even suggested that it may have contributed to the divorce.  'It was not one thing, it was many things [that led to the divorce]. Any of the questions remaining about what Bill's relationship with him was... those are for Bill to answer. I made it very clear how I felt about him.' A spokesperson for Gates told Insider last June that Gates had 'absolutely no business partnership or personal friendship' with Epstein, and any meetings between the two were about philanthropy. Melinda, who shocked the world when she and Bill announced in May 2021 that they were ending their 27-year marriage, previously told how she endured emotionally challenging times whilst working with the billionaire. The pair's divorce was finalized privately in Washington - where their Gates Foundation is based - in August. The terms of it were never made public but Bill was worth around $152billion at the time, giving Melinda a 50 percent settlement of $76billion.  That does not include the couple's vast property portfolio which comprised of homes in New York, Washington, and California. Melinda said in March that she and Bill are not friends but are 'friendly' and work together, and she suggested he had more than one affair throughout their marriage.  'I believe in forgiveness. I thought we had worked through some of that,' Melinda said of his 2000 affair with a Microsoft employee. I gave every single piece of myself to this marriage. I was committed from the day we got engaged to the day I got out of it.' Gates' spokeswoman confirmed he had a sexual relationship with a female staff member in 2000 and that he resigned as an investigation into the relationship was being conducted by an external law firm on behalf of the company board. The New York Times also reported that Gates asked out a Microsoft employee in 2006 after watching her make a presentation and, couple of years later, asked out an employee with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation - both while he was married. Gates reportedly told the Microsoft employee in an email: 'If this makes you uncomfortable, pretend it never happened.' She said she took his advice. Gates later allegedly asked an employee with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to dinner, while the pair were in New York for a trip. Last year, four Microsoft employees accused Gates of being an office 'bully' whose catchphrase was 'that's the stupidest f*****g idea I've ever heard' and supported claims he pursued sexual affairs with employees and journalists. Gates' reputation as a hot-tempered boss began not long after he launched tech giant Microsoft with childhood friend Paul Allen in 1975, Insider reported. A spokesperson for the billionaire has denied he mistreated employees. A former Microsoft executive who spoke on condition of anonymity told the outlet that 'having a meeting with Bill was just an opportunity to get yelled at, so I tried to avoid that.' Gates would even allegedly track his employees by memorizing their license plates, according to the outlet.  Maria Klawe, a former Microsoft board member, said 'a person like Bill Gates thinks the usual rules of behavior don't apply to him' and accused him of being unreceptive to suggestions about improving diversity. Klawe said that Gates behaved as if he was the 'smartest person in the room' and that diversity was not something Gates 'was interested in hearing about.' She said that, when female executives would suggest diversity initiatives, Gates would allegedly respond with: 'Are you trying to effing destroy the company?' A spokesperson for Gates told Insider that Klawe's allegations are a 'gross mischaracterization.'  Melinda herself was an employee at Microsoft, having been hired as a product manager in 1987, when the billionaire first asked her out months after flirting with her at a conference dinner. In the 1992 biography Hard Drive: Bill Gates and the Making of the Microsoft Empire, author James Wallace revealed Gates had an alleged affair with a married woman 13 years older than him when he was 27 years old. His alleged affair was with the wife of an Osborne Computer executive who lived abroad, according to the biography. Gates himself admitted to frequenting the area, centered on Washington Street between Boylston Street and Kneeland Street, in a 1994 interview he did with Playboy magazine. 'Just because I went there doesn't mean I engaged in everything that was going on,' Gates said. 'I ate pizza, read books and watched what was going on. I went to the diners.' Wallace claimed to Insider that Gates' penchant for socializing with women remained even after he started dating Melinda Gates in 1987. Gates was allegedly known to invite friends to swim naked at his bachelor pad in Laurelhurst where he 'rounded up' dancers from local all-nude nightclubs, Wallace said. 'I don't know if he physically transported them or if he just told them where to show up,' Wallace told the outlet. Robert X. Cringely, who wrote a popular computer gossip column for InfoWorld, told Insider that Gates was allegedly often inebriated at tech events and after-parties and that he 'got drunk pretty easily.' 'All of us will have been at some affair where Bill was clearly impaired. He was happier' drunk, Cringely said. Gates, then 33, took a helicopter to Les Arcs ski resort in the French Alps for an international sales meeting for Microsoft in the summer of 1988 where he was allegedly caught lying on top of a woman on the lawn. The pair were 'just snuggling' after Gates joined his employees for drinks in a Swiss chalet and partied until the early morning, Dan Graves, a former Microsoft export manager, told Insider. After he started dating Melinda, Gates allegedly struggled to commit to her and she was allegedly aware of his 'womanizing,' the outlet reported. The couple even broke up for at least a year early in their relationship. 'Bill wanted to be married, but he didn't know whether he could actually commit to it and have Microsoft,' Melinda said in an interview for the Netflix docuseries Inside Bill's Brain: Decoding Bill Gates. Even after marrying Melinda, Gates told Time magazine in 1997 that he still went on annual vacations to the Outer Banks of North Carolina with his ex-girlfriend Ann Winblad, the software entrepreneur whom he had dated from 1984 to 1987. Bill and Melinda Gates' personal affairs have been managed by Watermark Estate Management since at least 2001, which would allegedly arrange Gates' annual beach trips with Winblad.",

Surging house prices mean many borrowers who bought a home in the outer suburbs with a seven-figure price tag could be paying an $800 a month more on their mortgage within a year as rates keep rising. Speculation about a Reserve Bank rate rise on Tuesday has seen the property market peak, with the banks no longer offering cheap, two per cent fixed-rate loans in recent months. Sydney and Melbourne have now suffered the first quarterly falls since mid-to-late 2020, when open homes and in-person auctions were banned during the national Covid lockdowns. SYDNEY: Down 0.1 per cent in April, down 0.3 per cent in the quarter to $1,416,960 MELBOURNE: Down 0.2 per cent in April, down 0.5 per cent in the quarter to $1,000,926 BRISBANE: Up 1.7 per cent in April, up 5.9 per cent in the quarter to $880,332 ADELAIDE: Up 1.9 per cent in April, up 5.6 per cent in the quarter to $676,546 PERTH: Up 1.2 per cent in April, up 2.5 per cent in the quarter to $578,751 HOBART: Down 0.4 per cent in April, up 1.4 per cent in the quarter to $793,723 DARWIN: Up 1.3 per cent in April, up 3.2 per cent in the quarter to $576,149 CANBERRA: Up 1.3 per cent in April, up 2.5 per cent in the quarter to $1,070,220 Source: CoreLogic median house prices in April 2022 That means Australia's biggest markets are suffering the sharpest downturn since the era before the Reserve Bank slashed the cash rate to a record low of 0.1 per cent. Melbourne is Australia's worst-performing property market, with median house prices falling by 0.2 per cent last month and by 0.5 per cent in the three months to April to $1,000,926, CoreLogic data showed. But on an annual basis, the mid-point price has risen by 10.1 per cent. Sydney's median house price fell by 0.1 per cent in April and by 0.3 per cent over the quarter to $1,416,960. The annual growth pace has moderated to 17.1 per cent. But in Sydney's most upmarket suburbs, property prices had the biggest falls in April, dropping by 1.1 per cent in the Inner West, where houses typically cost more than $2million, and by 1 per cent in the City and Inner South and the Northern Beaches - where $3million is middle range. The Central Coast, an hour's drive north of Sydney, has seen a huge price surge of 29.5 per cent during the past year, with Umina now having a median house value of $1,159,493 even though it is 86km north of the city. Hobart also went backwards in April, with median house prices dipping by 0.4 per cent to $793,723. CoreLogic research director Tim Lawless said the downturn in Sydney and Melbourne was likely to spread nationally following an interest rate rise. 'With the RBA cash rate set to rise, potentially as early as tomorrow, we are likely to see a further loss of momentum in housing conditions over the remainder of the year and into 2023,' he said. 'Stretched housing affordability, higher fixed-term mortgage rates, a rise in listing numbers across some cities, and lower consumer sentiment have been weighing on housing conditions over the past year. 'As the cash rate rises, variable mortgage rates will also trend higher, reducing borrowing capacity and impacting borrower serviceability assessments.' Three of Australia's big three banks - ANZ, Westpac and NAB - are forecasting a 0.15 percentage point increase on Tuesday that would take the cash rate to 0.25 per cent. This would be the first official rate increase since November 2010. A borrower with a typical $600,000 mortgage would see their monthly repayments rise by $47 to $2,353 even with a slight cash rate increase, assuming the bank passes that on in full to a customer with a 2.29 per cent variable mortgage rate. Within a year, that could rise by $625 to $2,931 should the Reserve Bank keep increasing the cash rate to two per cent by 2023. A home owner in Sydney, Melbourne or Canberra paying off a house worth a million dollars would most likely have an $800,000 mortgage, with a 20 per cent deposit factored in. A small rate rise on Tuesday would see their monthly mortgage repayments rise by $62 to $3,137.  But within a year, monthly repayments could rise by $833 to $3,908 as variable mortgage rates climbed to 4.19 per cent.  $500,000: Monthly repayments rising by $39 from $1,922 to $1,961 $600,000: Monthly repayments rising by $47 from $2,306 to $2,353 $700,000: Monthly repayments rising by $54 from $2,691 to $2,745 $800,000: Monthly repayments rising by $62 from $3,075 to $3,137 $900,000: Monthly repayments rising by $70 from $3,459 to $3,529 $1,000,000: Monthly repayments rising by $78 from $3,843 to $3,921 Data based on variable rate increasing from 2.29 per cent to 2.44 per cent  The big banks last week updated their forecasts - to factor in a May rate rise - after official data showed inflation in the year to March surging by 5.1 per cent - the fastest pace since mid-2001 a year after the GST was introduced. This occurred as Russia's Ukraine invasion caused petrol prices to surge by 11 per cent in a year, with average prices in March hitting record levels above $2 a litre.  These three banks are also expecting the cash rate to hit two per cent in 2023 for the first time since May 2016.  The other capital cities are so far still thriving, despite talk of an early rate rise, with Brisbane's mid-point house price rising by 1.7 per cent to $880,332. Values surged by 5.9 per cent over the quarter and 32 per cent over the year.  In Adelaide, median house prices last month increased by 1.9 per cent to $676,546, rising by 5.6 per cent over three months and 28.4 per cent annually. Perth also had strong monthly growth, with house prices up 1.2 per cent in April and 2.5 per cent in the quarter to $578,751. On an annual basis, the West Australia capital had a more subdued growth pace of 6.9 per cent.  Darwin, which also peaked in 2014, saw its median house price climb by 1.3 per cent in April and by 3.2 per cent over the quarter to $576,149.

  "b4eb373b802053cd173feacfd98df408a693df2fffbbfba38d94afa3": "Blackface Morris dancers yesterday defied critics to entertain a May Day pub crowd, while still wearing their controversial make-up. Members of the Britannia Coconut Dancers in Bacup, Lancashire, split from The Joint Morris Organisation, the umbrella group which represents the country's 800 dancing teams, after being told to stop painting their faces black in 2020.  The dance body ruled that 'full face black or other skin tone make-up was a practice that had the potential to cause deep hurt' and members must stop in response to the Black Lives Matter campaign. But the group defied instruction and continued to take part in traditional celebrations, appearing in the same costumes and make-up, in front of the Crown Inn on Sunday.  And despite growing criticism, local ethnic minority charity, Lancashire BME Network, backed the dance troupe and said they had 'never seen it as a racial thing' within the context.  The Coconut Dancers typically wear red tunics, white hats, black jerseys, white stockings, shiny black clogs and paint their faces black, while performing to the public. While the exact origins of their costume is unclear, it is believed that their uniforms are influenced by the Moorish pirates who settled in Cornwall and soon entered the local mining industry during the 18th and 19th centuries. The pirates became employed in tin mines, before moving to the coal mines of the North. The group insist their blackened faces, a reference to the coal mining industry in the town they are based in, was part of a clog-dancing tradition dating back more than 100 years.  Another theory is that underpaid mill workers would dance to to earn extra income and painted their face black so their employers would not know they were dancing for money.

However, another troupe of Morris dancers last year ditched their 500-year-old blackface tradition amid a racism row and have performed for the first time while painted green. Silurian Border Morrismen had voted to scrap the black face paint for their Boxing Day Tour to avoid causing offence in the wake of the BLM movement. The group performed their English folk dance routine to crowds of onlookers in Ledbury, Herefordshire, with their faces painted dark green instead. Silurian foreman Ian Craigan admitted some people 'feel it is a step too far' but wants to be 'on the right side of things' to help attract new members to the club. The Britannia Coconut Dancers, also known as the Nutters, describe themselves as unique, with their dance routines involving eight men, each carrying a set of coconuts, which act as props similar to wooden castanets. While the dancers tap the coconuts together to create a rhythmical percussive sound, another member of the group, known as a 'whiffler', accompanies the performance with a whip.  Every Easter Saturday the group perform a dance in the Lancashire town raising thousands for good causes but were forced to cancel the annual procession due to the coronavirus pandemic.  In 2014, a beer named after the troupe was banned by the bar in the House of Commons as the image on the pump was deemed offensive. The troupe has an international fanbase, according to the Times, having performed in Germany, Belgium, Holland, Ireland and Spain.",
  "51fefdf04b60c221cb988b026b380841d65b44991f5e2e0eda37db76": "Disturbing photos have emerged of a one-time music teacher dressed up as a clown and wearing Harry Potter-themed pyjamas - as he and his boyfriend both admit to vile child sex offences.  Benjamin Heels, 33 - who has worked on multiple musical productions in Melbourne's south-east including Priscilla Queen of the Desert - pleaded guilty to a string of 35 offences on Friday.  The list of charges Heels admitted to, seen by Daily Mail Australia, include engaging in a sexual activity in the presence of a child under 16, intentionally sexually touching a child and producing child abuse material.  Heels reportedly appeared before Melbourne's Magistrates Court via video link, with court documents stating his offending occurred over a four-and-a-half month period, between January 1 and May 14, 2021. Fronting court alongside him was his boyfriend Tristan Cullinan-Smayle, who pleaded guilty to a separate series of charges.  They included possessing and transmitting child abuse material and procuring a child for sexual activity.  The court heard Cullinan-Smayle's offending went back to December 2017, when at 28, he used a carriage service to procure a child to engage in sexual activity.  The pair were both the subject of interim non-publication court orders which prevented the disclosure of their identities, and also to spare them 'embarrassment', the orders said. Those orders have both expired.  The case was first reported by the Herald-Sun.  Heels was arrested on May 26, 2021 in the Melbourne suburb of Berwick where he was caught with child abuse material on an electronic device.  The court heard Heels produced child abuse material at that location between January 1 and May 20 - six days before his arrest.  He had formerly worked at the Fountain Gate Secondary College as a music teacher and had been involved in numerous amateur community stage productions.  It comes as a bizarre Facebook post surfaced showing Heels expressing concern to parents about children singing songs about sex.  In June 2020, Heels said that listening to children singing songs about sex made him 'uncomfortable'. 'Parents please make sure you are sending your kids to a vocal coach who understands their voice,' he wrote. 'Call me old fashioned but I cringe and get so uncomfortable hearing children sing songs about sex.'  Heels and Cullinan-Smayle will front the County Court later this month.",
  "73d05feefec3c492fd58e7a52c0e030785b06fb7cf2b3c48db2631cb": "The full chaotic story of Scott Miller's doomed drug running escapade can finally be told as the Olympic swimmer faces sentencing for his inept attempt at smuggling meth.  Miller's plan to drive 4kg of meth worth $2.2million across New South Wales ended in his inevitable arrest along with three bumbling accomplices, one of whom he had met in rehab.  The entire shambolic scheme had no chance of success, with police watching, listening to and tracking every movement of the drugs from start to finish.  Miller, the 100m butterfly silver medallist at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, drove the meth about 280km from Sydney to Yass and handed over the consignment for transport to Albury. But the drugs were ditched more than 200km further south after two incompetent mules were involved in a high-speed pursuit with highway patrol officers.   One of those mules had shot up drugs just before the police chase and the other had only gone on the trip to keep his emotionally fragile friend company.  Even before Miller began his cross-state dash he was worried, desperately sending a message to another of his fellow conspirators: 'Tiger up my ass bro'. The investigation into Miller, who has a long history of drug use, began early last year after police discovered a shipment of candles which each contained half a kilogram of methylamphetamine.  By monitoring electronic communications police identified a group including 44-year-old Miller, Wayne Allan Johnson, 47, Justin Szabolics, 44 and 40-year-old Luke Mathew Peake, a hapless late addition to the plot. As a police source previously told Daily Mail Australia: 'You could say Scott Miller has been on the radar of law enforcement agencies across the country for some time.'  The NSW State Crime Command's Drug and Firearms Squad and NSW Crime Commission worked together on Miller under the auspices of Strike Force Tarrawilla.        After obtaining a surveillance device warrant police were able to install trackers, listening and optical devices inside a white Toyota Camry with Western Australian plates used by Miller. Those devices revealed the Camry had a hidden, electronically lockable compartment concealed behind the rear passenger seat which could only be opened with a specific sequence of actions. That process was meant to be sufficiently complex that the compartment could not be accidentally opened. At 4.30pm on January 11 Miller drove the Camry from Wise Street, Rozelle to White Street Balmain. The hide was empty when Miller got out of the car and walked to Elkington Park.  A short time later an unknown man wearing a hi-visibility shirt and face covering opened the rear passenger door and placed a blue, white and red bag into the footwell.  Inside the bag were eight candles in glass containers which contained 3,961 grams of meth, sometimes called 'eye' by suppliers.  The meth was in oil form, mixed in with the candle wax, and the intention was to convert it to crystals in a process known as sharding.   At 4.30pm Miller returned to the Camry and drove it to Thornton Street, Balmain where he appeared to use his mobile phone to take photos of the footwell. He then opened the hide - which required the ignition to be turned on - and loaded the contents of the bag into the compartment before closing it.  Miller drove the Camry to nearby Terry Street and left the vehicle parked there overnight.   Just after 6pm Miller contacted Johnson using the supposedly encrypted ANOM mobile phone app which was popular with criminals at the time. Miller's handle was EyeQ and Johnson called himself Snowy Mountain. Unknown to both men, ANOM had been set up by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation and communications were being monitored by Australian Federal Police analysts. Miller: 'Bro... Yo... I need the eye separated from the wax and sharded... Bro.' Johnson: 'I talk to them tomoz... I pushed for tonight. Someone was with him a few days ago. Said he couldn't see me Tull tomorow. Miller: 'Ok... I have pressure to do it quick from OS people... Yo... Yo.' About 12pm the next day Miller picked up the Camry and drove to Homebush then returned to Balmain without stopping. He messaged Johnson again at 12.04pm using ANOM. Miller: 'On way to Yass... On m4... Tiger up my ass bro... I need you... Meet me M4... I'm turning around... I'll come your area... ' Johnson: 'I'm on scooter 20 min.' Shorty before 1pm Miller told Johnson he was parked in a dead end near his home and to come outside, bringing his encrypted Ciphr phone. Johnson joined him about 1.30pm and said he couldn't find his Ciphr. Miller showed Johnson how to access the hide and Johnson placed something small inside the compartment. The pair then drove west on the M4 motorway. At 2.44pm they stopped at a service station at Pheasants Nest, about 100km south-west of Sydney, to refuel and purchase snacks. Johnson took over the driving. Down in Albury on the NSW-Victoria border on the same day, Peake had met up with Miller's friend Szabolics.  According to a statement of facts tendered in court, Szabolics told Peake he was working for Miller and he had to pick up a vehicle in Yass as part of his employment. '[Peake] was concerned about Szabolics driving such distances without company and offered to come with him,' the statement said. 'At the time Szabolics had broken up with a girlfriend and the offender was worried about his mental state.' Szabolics and Peake drove the 270km north-east to Yass and at 4.28pm checked into the Thunderbird Motel, where Miller and Johnson pulled up in the Camry about half an hour later. Johnson later accessed the hidden compartment several times, loading items and removing the blue, white and red bag. All four men later drove to a remote road where the Camry was refuelled from a jerry can and Johnson showed Szabolics how to open the hide. The group went back to the Thunderbird Motel where Johnson returned the bag to the Camry and Peake put it in the hidden compartment.  As the four stood around the car Szabolics questioned the wisdom of using a car with Western Australian plates and Miller reassured him it wasn't a problem. They all then had a meal at the Club House Hotel. Shortly before 9pm Szabolics and Peake got into the Camry and headed south on the Hume Highway for Albury. About 11pm they stopped at a rest area at Little Billabong for half an hour.  'During this time Szabolics injected 'gear' and told Peake about his relationship with Miller, saying that others were 'in his pocket' and that he 'gets s**t done',' a statement of facts said. 'He said that he and Miller had attended rehab together twice, and said, 'He's a good c**t 'cause he doesn't, like, you can do what you want as long as you're doing your s**t . Like, he doesn't tell me not take drugs.' The pair then resumed their journey with Peake - who was disqualified from driving - at the wheel. At 11.46pm a Holbrook highway patrol vehicle tried to stop the Camry and flashed its warning lights. Szabolics told Peake: 'Go'.  Police commenced a pursuit and Peake accelerated to 200km/h before braking harshly and turning onto Woomargama Way at Woomargama, crossing onto the wrong side of the road.  The pursuit was terminated by police who feared for their safety. Once the chase was over Szabolics and Peake argued about where they should go next and Szabolics took over the driving. 'After swapping, Szabolics told [Peake] it would be bad if they were caught with the contents of the bag,' a statement of facts said. 'Whilst Szabolics was driving, Peake said, 'We've just gotta get back to [indecipherable] and then we're going to f***ing stash the car somewhere'. 'The interior light of the car went on and Peake accessed the hidden compartment. Sometime later Peake said words to the effect 'stash this' and they slowed down and Peake said 'Tree'.' At 12.03am the Camry stopped at the intersection of Holbrook Wagga Road and Rose Valley Lane at Cookardinia where Peake put the bag behind a large tree in long grass. They then drove to Jindera Street, Jindera and abandoned the vehicle. Later that day police found the bag containing the drugs where Peake had put it. 'The following day Szabolics approached [Peake] and asked him to come and retrieve the items,' a statement of facts said.  '[Peake] refused as he did not want to be part of the criminal activity. However he later relented but they could not find the bag.' Peake and Szabolics were arrested for other matters on January 14 and held in custody. A search warrant was executed on Miller's apartment at Rozelle just after 6am on February 16  The Camry was found at the unit. Footage showed police busting down the door of the unit where Miller was photographed shirtless and slumped on a chair while investigators scoured the premises for evidence.  At his apartment police found 796.8 grams of heroin in a cardboard box inside a walk-in wardrobe. They located $2,175 in the same wardrobe, $500 in a satchel, and $69,870 in a safe. Miller was taken to Newtown police station where he took part in a recorded interview in which he responded 'no comment' to every question.  He was refused bail and has been on remand at the maximum-security Mid North Coast Correctional Centre near Kempsey.  Miller pleaded guilty in March to supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, supplying a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug and dealing with the proceeds of crime.  He was originally charged with knowingly directing a criminal group but after representations by lawyer Greg Goold that was downgraded to participating in the drug syndicate, to which he also pleaded guilty.  Johnson was arrested the same day as Miller but Peake and Szabolics were not charged over the drug run until March 16 - a month later.  Szabolics told police that Miller and Johnson were his friends, not Peake's, and that Peake knew less about the drug run than he did. 'He come for a drive with me,' he said.     Szabolics has pleaded guilty to supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug and participating in a criminal group.  Johnson has pleaded guilty to taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug and participating in a criminal group.    Peake pleaded guilty to taking part in the supply of a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, driving while disqualified and driving recklessly and at dangerous speeds during the police pursuit. In March he received minimum terms of 15 months for each offence and will be eligible for parole on May 13. Miller has admitted having troubles in his personal life in recent years. During an interview with 60 Minutes in 2014 he admitted he was battling a drug addiction.  He worked as a drug awareness and prevention speaker with the Church of Scientology's Narconon program, according to his LinkedIn profile.    Miller is also known for his brief marriage to Sydney socialite and TV presenter Charlotte Dawson between 1999 and 2000. Dawson took her own life in 2014. Before his arrest Miller had been working for a trucking company. Miller, Szabolics and Johnson will face sentencing hearings in the District Court in August.            At the time of his arrest over a $2.2million meth syndicate Miller was using the encrypted ANOM communication app. That was months before international law enforcement agencies revealed they had been secretly running ANOM and monitoring criminals using the service. Miller called himself 'EyeQ' on the app to communicate with an associate about the supply of prohibited drugs, according to court documents.    In one message he wrote: 'This both of our best opportunity yet to make proper money.' Another message from EyeQ stated, 'this is a line from OS we can earn good', followed by, 'H is the best market bro everyone has cash'. Police claim 'H' refers to heroin and that Miller was seeking to secure a buyer for a quantity of that drug through an associate, according to court documents. While Miller was found in possession of almost a kilogram of heroin after his arrest there is no evidence he ever supplied it to anyone. Court documents state GPS data puts a person using the ANOM handle EyeQ at or near Miller's address when the user describes himself as being 'home'. Four days before Miller was arrested over the meth syndicate, EyeQ sent messages saying, 'I got just under 900 grams returned' and 'passed loot back'.  ANOM was secretly set up and controlled by the FBI which encouraged distribution of the app to transnational serious organised crime groups. Communications were monitored by the Australian Federal Police in a covert three-year operation dubbed Ironside which culminated in the execution of hundreds of search warrants across the country last June. As of December, the AFP had charged 311 offenders with 820 offences and seized more than 7.3 tonnes of drugs, as well as $52million in suspected proceeds of crime. While Miller and at least one of his associates were allegedly using ANOM to discuss drug dealing his arrest was not part of Operation Ironside. ",

Australians will need to rug up in what will be the first proper taste of winter courtesy of a cold front moving up over the southern states and territories and reaching up to the Queensland border.  'It's going to be a shock to the system because it's been so mild,' said Dean Narramore, a forecaster at the Bureau of Meteorology. The meteorologist added there will be also be icy winds which will make the temperature feel even colder. Sydney will see brisk single digits minimums of 9C on Friday and Saturday, but the days will be mild reaching high temperatures of 19C on Friday but mostly in the low 20s. But while the cold weather will set in from Thursday, there will be a break in the rain that has plagued much of Australia's east coast. The weekend is looking set to be mostly sunny in Sydney and Brisbane providing a pleasant change for the waterlogged cities. The NSW capital has already hit its yearly average rainfall only four months into 2022. Melbourne from Thursday will also be chilly with minimums of 8C but the days will be slightly warmer, reaching 14C on Thursday, and there will likely be showers.  Canberra is set to get the frostiest mornings of the major cities - with overnight minimums sitting under 7C throughout the week.  The cold front will really hit on Thursday with the mercury dropping to just 1C in the nation's capital and reaching a maximum of 11C in the day.  Saturday will be a degree warmer with a 2C minimum and 12C maximum. Hobart will not be far behind with minimums of 8C on Thursday and Friday and maximums of about 13C. Adelaide will also be chilly with the mercury dropping to 9C on Thursday and Friday and then sitting below 20C in the days.  There could also be rain in Adelaide through the week, particularly on Wednesday.  Over on the western coast, Perth will just avoid shivering through single digits with minimums of 10C and 11C for Wednesday through to Saturday. While in the northern half of the country, the weather is looking good with minimums between 11C and 16C and maximums in the low 20s in Brisbane.  The rain will also ease for the weekend in the Queensland capital.  And Darwin will get summer-like minimums of 24C to maximums of 35C and sunny weather all week.  PERTH Monday Mostly sunny.

  "e1a82df8bf790d740053dc232c880085f503915ccdf0a17f820397fc": "Amber Heard has fired her PR team and switched to a new firm after she became frustrated following a week of 'bad headlines' during a bombshell defamation trial brought by ex-husband Johnny Depp, a new report claims. Heard was being represented by Precision Strategies, which she reportedly suddenly ditched in favor of LA-based consulting firm Shane Communications. She made the move in apparent hopes she might receive more favorable coverage this week - during which time she is expected to take to the stand and testify. 'She doesn't like bad headlines,' an unnamed source told the New York Post, which first reported the news. Another source told the newspaper Heard, 36, is 'frustrated with her story not being told effectively.' The A-list trial in Virginia, which started on April 11 and is set to last another three weeks, has so far seen Depp, 58, claim he was the victim of domestic abuse during his four days of testimony. His bodyguard on Thursday even described in detail the wounds on the actor's face allegedly sustained during a confrontation with Heard. The Pirates of the Caribbean star is suing Heard for $50 million, claiming she defamed him and ruined his career after a 2018 Washington Post article in which she described herself as a 'public figure representing domestic abuse', without naming her ex-husband. Heard is countersuing for $100million, and after three weeks of sitting silently in the courtroom during Depp's testimony, she is preparing to start her fight back, possibly as soon as Wednesday. The PR firm switch came following several days of court testimony from Depp witnesses that saw the social-media mob suddenly turn against Heard.  Heard's credibility as a philanthropist also took a battering when it was claimed she had not donated her $3.5 million divorce settlement to charity - something she had promised publicly to do.  She had apparently donated only $1.3 million -- and much of that appeared to have come from her ex-boyfriend, billionaire Elon Musk.  According to Terence Dougherty, the chief operating officer of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the recipient of Amber's 'largesse', $500,000 came from a Vanguard fund connected to Musk.  Her contributions dried up by 2019, and Dougherty told the court the ACLU 'learned that she was having financial difficulties'.  Heard's lawyer is arguing Depp abused the her both physically and sexually and she hopes to make her point once she takes the stand early this week. Shane Communications is led by its CEO David Shane, who has briefed against Depp in the past.  In 2017, the firm highlighted accusations made by Depp's former business managers, The Management Group, alleging that the Pirates of the Caribbean star needed to hire a shrink for his 'compulsive spending' habit of spending $2 million per month.  Depp then launched a $25 million lawsuit last month against his business managers, The Mandel Company, claiming 'gross mismanagement' of his affairs. One crisis communications expert told the Post that they believed the new PR company would have its work cut out in order to change the narrative. 'It's crazy to change teams in the middle of a trial like this because you don't like the headlines,' said Lis Smith, a senior communications director for Pete Buttigieg's 2020 presidential campaign. 'After years of narrative building, you can't change the public's opinion in the three weeks when someone is suing you in a case.' Heard never wanted cameras to be allowed in the courtroom at all, but Depp's team pushed for it, and won.  It means that the entirety of the trial could be heard by the public instead of the media simply cherry-picking what made it outside.  The trial has so far covered all manner of bizarre behavior with shocking allegations levied by both sides. Depp has even accused his ex of defecating on their bed in an act of aggression.  Testimony so far has also included photos of severed fingers, pictures of feces, videos of explosive arguments and temper tantrums, and even a discussion about the Hollywood star's penis. Depp denies the allegations of abuse noting how he brought the lawsuit in order to clear his name. Lawyers for Heard say such denials are not credible because the actor was too drunk and high to remember what occurred.  The trial in the Fairfax County Courthouse runs Monday to Thursday from 10am to 5pm, and is set to conclude on May 19.  Judge Penny Azcarate has a prescheduled conference from May 9 to 12 when the trial will pause for a week. ",
  "530ab8b3a33a36d63e3b62ba566b905c8e2dc2fd4acdb94170b974f0": "The Alabama guard who escorted a murder suspect out of jail on Friday had sold her home weeks earlier and filed for retirement just a day before the pair vanished, as the woman's family insists that she would never help a 'killer' escape. The Lauderdale County Sheriff's Office on Sunday released pictures of inmate Casey White, 38, as he walked the halls of the Lauderdale County Jail. In the pictures, Casey is seen tucking something under his right sleeve and looking around as he is followed by a prison guard. He was serving a 75-year sentence and facing the death penalty for a 2015 murder. He previously tried to escape and was supposed to always have two guards on him when Assistant Director of Corrections Vicky White, 56, picked him up from the jail at 9.41am on Friday. She told a booking officer she was taking him to the county courthouse for a mental health evaluation, but no such evaluation was scheduled that day. She also said she was going to a medical appointment for herself, which was confirmed by the doctors' office, but for which she never showed. An hour and a half later, they were both missing and her patrol car was found abandoned at a nearby shopping center.  The sheriff's office has since revealed that Vicky - who had a clean record and had been named 'employee of the year' four times - filed for retirement a day before she went missing. Her mother says Vicky had sold her house weeks earlier.  Lauderdale Sheriff Rick Singleton told NBC's Today Show: 'All indications are that she assisted him escape. The question we're trying to answer ... is, well did she do that willingly or was someone from outside threatening her?' But Vicky's family continues to insists she is a 'sweet person' who never even spoke about Casey White. A manhunt for Vicky and Casey White - who are not related - is ongoing, and the US Marshals Service is offering up to $10,000 for information about the pair. A news conference with more information is scheduled for Monday at 10.30am. Casey White, 38, is 6'9 and weighs 260 pounds. He was first arrested in 2015 after he engaged in a crime spree across Tennessee and Alabama. In one night, he staged a home invasion, two carjackings and multiple shootings that left a dog dead and a woman injured. He then led police on a 100 mile-per-hour chase. It ended with his stolen car stuck in a field south of Huntsville, Alabama.    Casey was found guilty of a total of nine charges, including trying to kill his ex-girlfriend and kidnapping her two roommates. Other charges included first degree robbery, first degree burglary, third degree burglary, breaking and entering a vehicle, animal cruelty for shooting a dog and attempting to elude. He was sentenced to 75 years in prison in April 2019. In June 2020, he wrote to Lauderdale County requesting a meeting with the sheriffs office, and confessed to killing Connie Ridgeway, 58 - providing a detailed description of the crime scene. He said he was paid to kill her, although no motive for hiring a hitman has ever been disclosed. He pleaded not guilty on grounds of insanity.  Sheriff Singleton said that officials with the Sheriff's Department first became suspicious at around 3.30pm Friday, when officers at the jail realized Vicky had never returned.  They repeatedly tried to call her, he said, but her phone kept going to voicemail. That's when they realized Casey never returned. On Friday, Singleton said that while the evidence points to Vicky helping Casey escape, her motivations are unclear. 'We are trying to determine was that done willfully, or was she somehow coerced or threatened into participating?' Singleton said, pointing to the various excuses she used to justify breaking protocol by taking Casey out of jail without other officers present. The jail official was armed with a 9mm handgun when she claimed she was taking Casey for an evaluation that wasn't ever scheduled. She said she would then head to a medical appointment for herself that also turned out to not take place. 'It was all bogus,' Singleton said. 'That leads us to believe that she was involved.' Casey should have always had two deputies with him, he added.  The sheriff said it would be nearly impossible for Casey to get out of his handcuffs and free himself without any help, but he added that helping Casey would be out of character for Vicky, who had been named 'employee of the year' four times. 'I don't think there's any question she assisted, but to do it willingly would be so out of character for the Vicki White we all know,' he said.  On Saturday, Singleton said investigators are still treating the case as if she was taken against her will. 'Knowing the inmate, I think she's in danger, whatever the circumstances,' the sheriff said. 'He was in jail for capital murder and he had nothing to lose. 'Whether she assisted him or not, we don't know and we won't address that until we have absolute proof that's what happened,' he added, noting: 'We are assuming at this point that she was taken against her will, unless we can prove otherwise.'  Vicky's family members have since come forward to say she was a 'sweet person' who wouldn't have helped a 'killer' escape. Frances White, Vicky's former mother-in-law, told DailyMail.com on Sunday that the accusations against Vicky don't match the 'awfully good person' she knows. 'I can't understand her leaving with a guy she knew was a murderer,' said Frances, 88, who said she last spoke to Vicky about a month ago. 'If he killed one person, he'd kill another.'  She says she has a hard time believing Vicky would have cooperated with Casey, who confessed to killing a 58-year-old woman while serving a 75-year sentence for a string of crimes, including animal cruelty for shooting a dog. Frances, 88, says Vicky was married to her son Tommy White more than 16 years ago for about two to three years, eventually leaving him when his drug problems got bad.   'I read it in the paper this morning,' she told DailyMail.com Sunday afternoon. She left with that man. I said, 'I can't see her doing that. She wasn't that kind of person.' Vicky and Tommy raised cattle on a farm right across the street from her home, she said. 'She raised baby cows and stuff, and she worked hard,' Frances said. She added that Vicky remained close with her and her son even after the divorce. Tommy died in January after struggles with Parkinson's Disease. 'Before my son got to where he couldn't drive, Vicky would always - she would come out to the car and help him in. 'We still was really good friends. She was a really sweet person,' Frances said. Vicky had been with the Sheriff's Department for 17 years. NBC's Today show reported that she had turned in her retirement papers on Thursday - the day before she vanished. Vicky's mother, Pat Davis, says she also doesn't believe that her daughter would willingly help an inmate she never even talked about. Davis says Vicky sold her house and had been living with her for the past five weeks, but that she never brought up retirement or Casey White's name. 'You know, I never heard of him, never seen his picture, nothing. I didn't know anything about him,' she told WAAY. 'We don't know if she was took by force or if she was voluntarily in this. But we just want her back, that's all we want,' Davis said.  'She's never done anything, I bet she's never even had a speeding ticket. But I mean, she's always been, what I say, a good person. And like I say, this is all a shock.' The US Marshals Service announced on Sunday that it is offering up to $10,000 for information about an escaped inmate and a 'missing and endangered' correctional officer who disappeared Friday after the two left a jail in north Alabama.  Casey admitted to killing Connie Ridgeway, who was found stabbed to death in a killing that shocked the small town of Rogersville - about 50 mi west of Huntsville. People who knew Ridgeway, 58, said she was known for her friendliness and willingness to help others, and the community for many years held a vigil every October in her memory. Casey's arrest at the age of 32 finally came after he engaged in a crime spree across Tennessee and Alabama. In one night, he staged a home invasion, two carjackings and multiple shootings that left a dog dead and a woman injured. The crimes were followed by a chase, where speeds reached more than 100 miles per hour, WHNT reported. It ended with a stolen car stuck in a field south of Huntsville, and officers - who were evidently well known to him - pleading with him to put down his gun and give himself up. White got out of the vehicle with a gun and threatened to shoot officers and himself unless he could speak with Limestone Sheriff Mike Blakely. Body-cam footage shows deputies attempting to get White to surrender by offering him smokeless tobacco and Sun Drop citrus soda while they waited for Blakely to arrive. Casey White was found guilty of a total of nine charges, including trying to kill his ex-girlfriend and kidnapping her two roommates. Other charges included first degree robbery, first degree burglary, third degree burglary, breaking and entering a vehicle, animal cruelty for shooting a dog and attempting to elude. He was sentenced in April 2019 to 75 years in prison. In June 2020, he wrote to Lauderdale County requesting a meeting with the sheriffs office, and confessed to killing Ridgeway - providing a detailed description of the crime scene. He said he was paid to kill her, although no motive for hiring a hitman has ever been disclosed. In October 2020, Casey White, aged 37, appeared in court for an arraignment hearing, and requested to stay at the Lauderdale County Jail instead of going back to prison, WAFF reported. His request was denied, after authorities said they believed that he was plotting to escape the Lauderdale County Jail. They had found a makeshift knife, stashed in the showers, and suspected White was intending on using it to force someone to let him out. 'We got information yesterday that he had made a shank and he intended to escape today and take a hostage,' said Connolly, Lauderdale County district attorney, during the hearing. 'Our deputies did a great job. 'Found the shank and eliminated that threat this morning so we obviously aren't equipped to house somebody like that for that long term in our jail, so we are happy that the judge ordered him to go back to the department of corrections.' White, having confessed, then pleaded not guilty, on grounds of insanity.",
  "f11dd11d2ed24b43ba5bb156bb9f5b111af8f4e1885e7c13dcb8aa6a": "Scott Morrison has blasted Labor's policy to help Aussies buy homes by taking a 40 per cent stake in new properties. The Prime Minister said Anthony Albanese was 'making money off you' after the Labor leader said the policy would generate cash for the Government. Labor's new Help To Buy scheme would see the Government chip in up to 40 per cent of the cost of a new home, and up to 30 per cent of an existing home. The scheme would be available to couples on less than $120,000 and singles on less than $90,000.  When the homeowner eventually sells their house, the Government would pocket 30 or 40 per cent of the sale, making money for taxpayers. But Mr Morrison said this would be immoral if the homeowner spent thousands on renovations only to see the Government make money from their improvements upon sale.  'So, what happens if you decide to renovate your home,' he said. 'As your home value increases, they are making money off you. So, as your home price goes up, your home value goes up, they are taking a cut, and so you have to pay the Government back on their equity and with the capital appreciation. 'I mean, they are basically riding on your decision to buy your own home.' Mr Morrison said another major flaw in the scheme was that it would just push house prices up further.  'You will be going along to an auction, and there will be someone who is bidding against you, and they will be bidding with the Government and you will be bidding on your own,' he said. 'So I don't think Labor have thought these things through.'  Help to Buy will be available to Australians with a taxable income of up to $90,000 for individuals and up to $120,000 for couples.  Homebuyers must be Australian citizens and not currently own or have an interest in a residential dwelling. They do not need to be first home buyers. Eligible homebuyers will get an equity contribution of up to 40 per cent of the purchase price of a new home and up to 30 per cent of the purchase price for an existing home. The homebuyer will need to have a deposit of 2 per cent and qualify for a standard home loan with a participating lender to finance the remainder of the purchase. During the loan period the homebuyer can buy out part of all of the government's stake in the home when they are able to do so.  The homebuyer will not be required to pay rent on the stake of the home owned by the Federal Government.  Labor believe the scheme will cost $329million but will make money for the government by recovering its equity stake when homes are sold, plus its share of any profits made on the increased vale of the home when it's sold. Labor says a cap of 10,000 places per year will prevent the scheme from pushing up prices. Mr Morrison said that last year 164,000 Australians got into their first home - 70,000 more than when Labor left office. His government introduced the Home Guarantee Scheme which allows Aussies to purchase first homes with a deposit of just five per cent, with the Government guaranteeing the other 15 per cent.  Single parents only need a two per cent deposit.  Last month the PM announced an increase in the price cap to a maximum of $900,000.   Worsening housing affordability has seen home ownership for low and moderate income earners decline from 60 per cent to 28 per cent over the last 40 years. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported a 23.7 per cent increase in residential property prices in the last 12 months alone.

The woman, who has not yet been identified but is reportedly in her 30s, was at her San Antonio home with her three children at around 10 p.m. Thursday when she heard the man break in. Police say the man - who was later identified as 41-year-old Roman Rodriguez - entered the home from the rear through the laundry room, which is adjacent to South Side Lions Park, according to News 4 San Antonio. Photos from the scene show a fence around the house also appeared to be broken.  At that point, police say, the woman grabbed a gun and shot the home intruder twice in the chest. By the time police arrived on the scene of the 600 block of Kashmuir Place, they found Rodriguez sitting in a chair in the backyard as he bled out. Rodriguez died from his wounds on the way to the hospital, police report, with the Bexar County Medical Examiner ruling he died from gunshots to his torso, KSAT reports.  No other injuries were reported.  Police are still investigating the shooting, but the homeowner is reportedly not facing any charges due to the state's Castle Doctrine, which allows for the use of force against another person who is unlawfully and forcefully entering or attempting to enter one's home, vehicle or work place, according to News 4 San Antonio.",
  "3b4c13a5df23344aa02cdf09858be7af8a4ad40c1b5a1daee5b8eaa4": "A hidden mobile speed camera parked between several vehicles to catch out unsuspecting motorists has renewed calls for the return of more warning signs. A driver shared footage of the sneaky camera tucked away on one of Sydney's busiest roads, sparking widespread debate. Dash cam shows the eagle-eyed motorist turning onto Lyons Road at Drummoyne in the city's inner-west on Sunday approaching a 50km/h zone when he spots a mobile speed camera ahead. 'Parked in between three parked cars is a speed camera, a fixed speed camera vehicle,' the astonished driver says. He sent the footage to 2GB broadcaster Ben Fordham, who has slammed the placement of the mobile speed camera and renewed calls for more warning signs. The footage was also sent to NSW roads minister Natalie Ward, who insisted the sign was clearly visible and that the vehicle was legally parked. She added the government had listened to the community with the recent return of warning signs on speed camera vehicles.  The signs returned in February following a public backlash as speeding fines skyrocketed. In the 12 months to December 2021, almost $40.4million worth of fines were issued for low range speeding - 10kmh or less over the limit.  More than 295,000 fines were issued.  Former roads Minister Duncan Gay has slammed his own government's decision to remove warning signs. 'The way it was before was a better and fairer way,' he told 2GB in November. 'I think it's better to be able to tell someone that they've either passed the speed camera and been got or if they're really close that they've got time to slow down.' Fordham believes the revamped mobile speed camera policy is still ruthless and accused the government of being addicted to the revenue 'because it's easy money' from 'relatively safe drivers'. 'Minister, if you're listening to the community, you'd have the old system back, the one aimed at slowing people down as opposed to catching them out,' he said. 'If speed is the biggest killer, focus on people who are knowingly doing the wrong thing, not those travelling a few kilometres over the limit.' 'Most of the people nabbed by these speed cameras are travelling less than 10 kilometres over.' NSW Labor leader Chris Minns has vowed to bring back the old system if he's elected NSW Premier next year with advance warning signs to be implemented 250 and 50 metres before and 50 metres after. 'This will be an election issue for Dominic Perrottet and I won't be surprised if he turns the partial backflip into a full backflip before the election next year,' Fordham concluded. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Transport for NSW for comment. The department insists every dollar from camera enforcement fine goes into the Community Road Safety Fund and reinvested back into improving road safety. The latest hidden camera divided motorists online. While many see it as revenue raising, others say drivers should be complying with the road rules. 'Nothing new, it's legal. Don't like it, drive to the speed limit. Not sure why that is so difficult to do and comprehend,' one commented.",
  "39b2115dc0fe06c00e70e33061b5f0a1d264a42e006e4787d028ee4c": "MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell rejoined Twitter on Sunday - more than one year after he was banned from the site for promoting election misinformation  - only to be re-suspended again just four hours later. Lindell was banned from Twitter in late January 2021 for promoting unfounded claims that the 2020 presidential election results were fraudulent.  The social media company said at the time those tweets violated its civic integrity policy it implemented in September 2020 to fight disinformation online. But following the news that Tesla CEO Elon Musk was taking over control of the company, Lindell created a new account on Sunday afternoon, writing: 'Hello everybody, I'M BACK ON TWITTER. 'My only account is @MikeJLindell!' he wrote in the tweet at 1:25pm. 'Please RT and FOLLOW to SPREAD THE WORD.' The tweet also included a video of him apparently on a private jet, saying: 'Hello everyone on Twitter, this is Mike Lindell. I'm here to tell you about my new account.' He then cautioned his fans about fake accounts impersonating him. 'So we started this account,' Lindell said, according to Newsweek. 'Please share it with everyone you know. Let everybody you know - so we can get the word out over here at Twitter in case they do take it down. 'And thanks a lot for helping out.' Within about five minutes, Lindell's new account was followed by over 20,000 users, Newsweek reports, and he racked up more than 37,000 followers before his account was removed shortly after 5pm. A spokesperson for Twitter told Newsweek the account was permanently suspended for violating the platform's rules on ban evasion. Lindell's shortly lived time back on Twitter came as conservatives continue to celebrate Tesla CEO Elon Musk's $44 billion deal to take over the company. Musk, who is now the owner of the platform, has described himself as a 'free-speech absolutist' and has said that he aims to make Twitter a more open 'digital town square.' 'Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,' Musk wrote in a statement upon the purchase approval. He claimed in his bid to take over the company that it was too restrictive in clamping down on expression after a number of high-profile conservatives had been suspended or blocked from the platform.  A recent study by researchers at MIT and Yale found that Republican users tend to be suspended more often than Democrats - but conservatives are more likely to share misinformation that would get them banned. Most recently, the account of Babylon Bee - a satirical news website - was suspended for a tweet naming Assistant Secretary of Health Rachel Levine - who is transgender - 'Man of the Year.' The account was suspended for violating Twitter's ban on hate speech it said at the time. But now Musk is likely to slash Twitter's policies on hate speech and misinformation as he seeks to encourage more free speech on the site - a promise that has been lauded by Republican lawmakers. 'It finally feels like someone is standing up for a principle that has been going in an opposite direction lately: less free speech, less ability to express yourself - if you are a conservative,' Rep. Bill Huizenga, of Michigan, told the Los Angeles Times following the news of Musk's acquisition of the site. Others expressed their happiness with the news directly on the site, with Rep. Jody Hice, of Georgia, tweeting: 'WELCOME BACK FIRST AMENDMENT' and Sen. Ted Cruz, of Texas, putting out a survey asking if Musk's purchase of the site was a good thing. The only options on the survey were 'yes' or 'no, I hate free speech.' Meanwhile, prominent conservatives on the social media site have seen their Twitter followers balloon since Musk's purchase of the company was first announced. The company has long been accused of 'shadow-banning' certain accounts by allegedly setting its algorithm to promote or demote a user's tweet. Musk has now said he is looking to make the algorithm publicly available to address these concerns. But conservatives have already seen their follower counts surge, prompting some, like former first son Donald Trump Jr. to claim it is proof of the shadow bans. The former first son received 87,296 new followers on Tuesday, and another 119,002 on Wednesday morning - after weeks of averaging just about 7,000 new followers a day, according to the New York Post. 'While I'm awesome, and totally deserving of 87,000 new followers a day, it seems that someone took the shackles off my account,' he tweeted on April 26. 'Wonder if they're burning the evidence before new [management] comes in?' Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also received more than 205,000 new followers in one day over the past week, the Post reports, and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz gained more than 112,000 new followers. Controversial Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, of Georgia, meanwhile, also saw her followers gain by more than 130,000, while podcaster Joe Rogan's follower count exploded by nearly 135,000  And conservative radio host Dana Loesch gained more than 22,000 followers in just two days - up from a daily average of 574. She tweeted that she was 'noticing an increase in followers and engagement after losing huge chunks ... for the past few years. 'It's too soon for Musk to have done this, but I'm wondering if something was changed by those seeking to minimize their fingerprint ahead of potential transparency.' At the same time, though, woke Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez shed more than 38,000 followers after gaining an average of 966 new followers a day, and Vice President Kamala Harris lost more than 28,000 followers after gaining a daily average of 2,300. Former Democratic presidential candidates also faced declining follower counts, according to the Post, with 21,000 of Hillary Clinton's followers vanishing after she received a daily average increase of 1,900 new followers a day. And Sen. Bernie Sander's follower count declined by more than 23,000, while Warren lost 17,800. In the ten days prior, the Post reports, they had averaged 1,800 and 650 new followers a day, respectively. Twitter executives now say they are looking into the fluctuations of followers, but said it appeared to have largely been due to an increase in conservative people creating accounts, while more liberal users are deleting theirs.  They also said they are continuing to 'take action on accounts that violate our spam policy, which can affect lower follower count' - but stopped short of addressing concerns about alleged shadow bans.

The RSPB has just recorded 183 pairs of Dartford warblers - the highest number ever - up from only ten pairs in the 1960s. The bird, which thrives in dense gorse on lowland heathland, is sensitive to the cold and was nearly wiped out by the 'Big Freeze' winter of 1962/63 when temperatures fell to -22.2C (-8F). But milder winters and efforts to restore heathland have seen it fare better. Thirty-seven pairs were spotted at RSPB Minsmere on the Suffolk coast last year, up from 23 pairs in 2019. Eighty per cent of UK heathland, which supports a wide range of wildlife from birds to amphibians, has been lost since the 19th century as a result of land-use change. Mel Kemp, the warden at RSPB Minsmere, oversaw the heathland restoration at the site, including across 17 hectares of ex-coniferous plantation, and is delighted with the outcome. He said: 'We have seen a steady increase in the number of Dartford warblers, alongside other species relying on heathland habitats such as nightjar. 'All the hard work of restoring this habitat has really paid off.' Despite their gradually increasing numbers, Dartford warblers are still considered an amber listed species in terms of conservation status. Rare birds like woodlark and nightjar also nest on heathland sites, which are often popular places to walk, cycle, horse ride and picnic. ",

The man also took his two dogs and a cat with him - killing one of the dogs and the cat. The other dog broke its legs and was taken to a local animal hospital for treatment.  The horrific incident occurred at 575 Grand Street, close to FDR Drive, around 3:30 p.m. on April 28.  The building is known as the East River Coop.   The man was 51 years old, the New York Daily News reported - though he has not been formally identified. The man was rushed to Beth Israel Hospital with severe trauma, where he later succumbed to his injuries.  A neighbor told the New York Post, 'Why would he do that to those poor animals? They don't deserve that. Lord knows why he jumped but they don't deserve that,' said another resident of the building that didn't want to be identified.'  This incident occurred a day after a Brooklyn mother dropped her 6-month old infant child out of a window. The child survived but was critically injured.  Earlier this week, New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced that $7.2 million was being invested in strengthening crisis call center services for New Yorkers.

  "b89b61980698cd27d21948c74ce9b06ec0f9898865e85892fd33f408": "A popular Australian DJ has suddenly died in the Netherlands just days after sharing an Instagram post about his 'rebirth'.  Ryan Biggs, 30 - best known as the artist DELETE - was found dead at a home in Waalwijk, in the south of the Netherlands, on Saturday night.  The cause of Mr Biggs' death has not been confirmed, but local media outlets report that police are not treating the incident as suspicious.  Mr Biggs spent the past nine years in Europe making a name for himself in the hardstyle community, with devastated relatives revealing it hadn't always been easy. His stepmother, Annmarie Biggs, said he had struggled with his mental health at times during his time away from home.  DELETE was known as the 'king of gated kicks', a sound technique popular in his style of music, and had garnered more than 67,000 fans on social media from across the world.  Biggs had previously opened up about his struggles with depression and had cancelled shows in the past and stalled song releases due to his state of mind.  Two weeks before his death, Biggs issued a message to followers as he played what would be his final set at the Netherlands' REBiRTH festival.  He thanked them for sticking with him throughout his career even during his period of 'silence' and vowed to give them an incredible performance, describing what he was going through himself as a rebirth. 'My rebirth process has begun!' the post began.  'I'm so grateful for all my fans that have stuck with me the past few years while I was silent.' 'I'll make sure it was worth the wait. 'WE ARE UNSTOPPABLE!' Devastated fans and friends flocked online to pay their respects to the beloved DJ as the hardstyle community reels over his unexpected death.  Fellow Australian DJ Toneshifterz said he was in 'absolute shock'. 'Rest in peace legend,' he said. 'It was too early for you to leave, you touched many peoples hearts with your music and we will miss you. We lost an Australian hardstyle Legend today.'  Dutch DJs Randy 'Ran-D' Wieland and Bob van der Palen, aka B-Front also offered their condolences to his family and said he would be 'missed'.  'I'm absolutely shattered right now,' one fan wrote. 'Thank you for everything. I'm grateful that I got to witness you multiple times in Australia. You will never be forgotten in the hardstyle community. RIP King' 'I am so upset on what has happened today,' another person said,'12 years ago you have changed my life, first artist to make me fall in love with the RAW scene, your style of music makes me happy every time I hear it. 'Keep kickrolling up in heaven.' Biggs' biggest hit was 'Payback ', featuring MC Tha Watcher, which almost 2 million hits on YouTube and 8 million on Spotify since its release in 2018.  He performed at some of the world's largest hardstyle events including Defqon.1, Decibel, QAPITAL, Loudness, Q-BASE, Dominator, Masters of Hardcore, Hard Bass, and Supremacy.  In recent years, he had been open about battling with depression which had led to delays in releasing his albums as he grappled with 'burnout'.  In March 2021, he revealed the past seven years had been 'tough' after he suffered a number of 'tragic events' in 2013 when he first migrated to Europe. 'My struggle with depression, anxiety and other mental problems have gotten worse every year for the past few years,' he wrote on Facebook.   'The depression I had never really went away... it turned dark again ever since my album at the end of 2018. Hardstyle is a sub-genre of Electronic Dance Music (EDM). It is characterised by heavy use of synthesisers and sound distortion. It emerged in the Netherlands in the late 1990s and mixes influences from techno, new beat, and hardcore.  This style tends to features a hard-sounding kick drum and distorted and detuned vocals.  Popular hardstyle musical festivals include Syndicate, Tomorrowland, Imagination, and Defqon.1. 'Depression is debilitating and makes the simplest things much more difficult. It really has taken away my ability to accomplish anything meaningful. Finishing music used to be second nature, but lately it's like climbing a huge mountain.' Biggs said he had started seeking help after becoming overwhelmed after taking on too many projects at the beginning of 2021 after fans asked him to make more music. 'I just started it way too optimistically and jumped the gun scheduling releases when I really shouldn't have, but the silver lining is that I finally made the move to get help. I've finally started medication, getting psychologic help etc,' he said. 'I want to thank you for your support over all these years and being patient with me.  'The one thing that has kept me going is the love and support I get from you guys, and my colleagues/label(s)/agency, who also have been great.' Biggs leaves behind his father Gary, mother Yvonne, sister Jess, step mother Annmaree, and step brothers Grant and Jeremy.  His stepmother Annmaree Biggs has launched a GoFundMe to help raise funds to bring the musician's body back home to Australia.  Ms Biggs said he left his homeland to follow his dreams as a DJ and producer in the hardstyle scene, and the distance had been hard on his family.  'It's been so hard for us with Ryan on the other side of the world, but we have watched his successes and were so proud of him,' she said. 'For the last few years it has been tough on Ryan with the lockdowns and mental health issues but he gave it everything he had for his fans.' Ms Biggs said the family were devastated' to wake up on Sunday to the 'absolutely shattering' news of his death.  'We need to get him home to lay him to rest.. and give him the funeral that he deserves to celebrate his life as a family and start healing,' she said. 'Please help us get Ryan aka 'Delete' back to his family and home where he can rest in peace.'

  "c4d9893cf3eb29dd92832a058f51ced457f6ee493b2286e84f635f99": "Sydney socialite Hollie Nasser - who started a relationship with her best friend's husband - has told friends she is now 'single' and 'looking forward to dating'. Ms Nasser shocked the city's eastern suburbs social clique in late 2021 when she announced she was dating investment banker Charlie Aitken, her best friend Ellie's husband. Complicating things further was the fact Mr Aitken was in business with Ms Nasser's investor husband, Christopher. But five months since the new couple went public, Daily Mail Australia has been told Ms Nasser is openly telling people she is 'single', signalling she is no longer in a relationship with Mr Aitken. Since announcing she was single, Ms Nasser has been posting pictures to her social media accounts enjoying days at Randwick races and nights out with friends. She did not respond to calls for comment on Friday.  Now that all four parties have gone their separate ways, Daily Mail Australia reveals what each is up to now: Ms Nasser and Mr Aitken spent several months in a love bubble.  They were trying to take things slow, but intense public scrutiny of their relationship added a level of pressure they didn't expect - or know how to handle. They quietly parted ways earlier this year and are said to be disappointed in how everything played out. Well-placed sources say Ms Nasser, a mother to two girls she shares with ex-husband Christopher Nasser, has been speaking openly about being single again. She reportedly confided in friends she was struggling with all the attention the relationship brought her. 'She never wanted it,' a friend said. 'She just wanted to get back to being a mum. 'Hollie really just wants to move on with her life.' It's understood she and her girls are hunkering down at their Paddington home with Covid this week. Ms Nasser has slowly started making appearances again on major events in the social calendar. She recently shared pictures from two events at Randwick Racecourse.   Despite trying to keep a low profile in the early days of their relationship, Mr Aitken and Ms Nasser were often seen making grand, public displays of affection. Word of their split first made waves through their social circles in Sydney's east, but they denied there was any trouble. Now, Mr Aitken's focus has again turned to his business, the Aitken Investment Management.  The company took a hit in the wake of Mr Aitken's relationship woes, with Ms Nasser's jilted estranged husband Christopher Nasser pulling a reported $7.5million from the fund and stepped off the board of AIM after five years as director and shareholder. Major backer Kerry Stokes also sold his 19% stake.   Charlie later revealed AIM Global High Conviction Fund delivered a return of 3 per cent after fees in December, compared to a benchmark return of 1.7 per cent. That means for the whole of 2021, AIM had a 31.1 per cent return after fees, ahead of a 29.3 per cent benchmark. He's also gone out of his way to mend his relationship with his estranged lawyer wife Ellie Aitken, and the pair are amicable for the sake of their children.  While Ms Aitken's life was flipped on its head in the wake of her marriage bust up, she appears to have seamlessly slipped back into what she does best. Just last month she helped to organise an event for the Art Gallery of NSW celebrating women in art. She also attended Justin Hemmes' Silver Party on behalf of the Sydney Children's Hospital Foundation.  Ellie still holds a senior position with investment firm Pallas Capital after jumping ship from her estranged husband's company in the wake of their split.  During the initial controversy, Ms Aitken snapped and released private conversations with Ms Nasser accusing her former friend of 'bullying', before whisking her family away for a holiday in Aspen. She flew out of Sydney on December 15 for a quiet break to avoid the intense limelight of the public fallout of her 19 year marriage. 'The truth is that despite the support of friends and family I have not coped well with the deeply hurtful lies, gossip and innuendo that has surrounded the breakdown of my relationship,' she said in a statement released on her departure. She announced she would be 'taking a break from social media' and public view while she and her family adjust to the separation and her estranged husband's new relationship. Ms Aitken is now in a much better place according to friends, and has been spending time with her ex for the sake of their two children. 'People really admire how gracious she has been throughout this ordeal. She's doing much better and definitely has her groove back,' said a source. Eight weeks ago, Ms Aitken shared a picture of her ex and their son supporting their daughter at a sailing competition. Of all four parties, Christopher Nasser has kept the lowest profile.  Friends said he was 'mortified' that the breakdown of his marriage played out so publicly and sought comfort in his close network.  On top of the devastating split, Mr Nasser was hit with an AVO taken out by his ex and the matter appeared several times before the courts until it was eventually dropped. Mr Nasser's lawyer Paul McGirr told Daily Mail Australia he had argued with police that the AVO was 'baseless', and had been used 'as a sword instead of a shield' against a non-violent person. Hollie also said that she, too, sought to have the AVO dropped. The grounds for the order were allegations of 'general intimidation behaviour' during the marriage which foundered late last year. Mr McGirr said that Mr Nasser had been 'bewildered and shocked' by the restraining order and 'he now wants to move on with his life'. Like Ms Aitken and Mr Aitken, Mr Nasser is co-parenting his daughters with his ex.

Tasmania on Monday became the last jurisdiction to eliminate the requirement for people to isolate for a week if a member of their household had the virus. There are around 330,000 active coronavirus cases around the country, with more than 3,000 in hospital with the virus. Meanwhile, NSW and Victorian health authorities confirmed last week they had detected evidence of two new sub-variants of the Omicron strain - BA.4 and BA.2.12.1. The World Health Organisation has declared the BA.4 strain a highly transmissible variant of concern. An article in the Medical Journal of Australia published on Monday documented the 'huge challenges' the virus presented for general practices over the past two years. Author Claire Jackson from the University of Queensland, said digital innovation, phone and videoconference consulting, remote monitoring, and new models of care offering optimal access had been 'the big winners from the COVID-19 experience'. While telehealth rebates were modest, digital access to GPs had been embraced by patients 'and will be hard to unwind'. 'At this time, the vast majority of those affected have mild disease and are able to manage well at home with practice telehealth support,' the report said. '2022 will no doubt present new challenges as COVID-19 continues to alarm, dismay and disconcert.

Western Australia's government meanwhile announced it will provide a further 10 free rapid antigen tests to close contacts who are asymptomatic. The tests, which can be collected at vaccination and testing clinics across the state, are in addition to the 15 free tests which are already being distributed to every household.",
  "dc809edf3279b5db845c3a4ee4fb68a7e01f85697508784b944f0159": "Virgin Australia said it will add four new Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft to its fleet to meet higher demand as the airline expects to hit pre-pandemic domestic capacity by mid-2022. The model, which saw two fatal crashes in a six-month period between October 2018 and March 2019 that resulted in 346 deaths, had been suspended from markets around the world. However, major airlines around the world have began re-purchasing the 737 MAX's after being cleared by the Federal Aviation Administration and national bodies. There are now more than 2,000 flights on the aircraft and 41 airlines have returned them to service. In a statement last Friday, Virgin Australia's CEO said the increase in demand for flights around the country due to the pandemic subsiding saw the need for the company to bring in the new fleet of planes. 'We are on track to return to 100% of pre-COVID domestic capacity by June this year and expect to well exceed those levels by year's end,' Virgin boss Jayne Hrdlicka said. 'The restructured agreement and changes to the delivery schedule of the Boeing 737 MAX 10 gives us the flexibility to continually review our future fleet requirements, particularly as we wait for international travel demand to return. She said the 737 MAX 10 would be deployed on high-density domestic and short-haul international routes.  Australia's second-biggest airline, which is now owned by U.S. private equity group Bain Capital, also saw high demand in the resources sector and in contract flying in Western Australia. The four new aircraft will take the airline's fleet of 737 planes to 88 and enter service early next year. In 2020, Virgin Australia restructured its 737 MAX order to include more of the largest 737 MAX 10 variant and had pushed back on the smaller MAX 8.  Virgin has removed 777 and Airbus SE A330 widebody planes from its fleet, centering its operations around the 737 as part of an effort to cut costs as it repositions as a largely domestic mid-tier airline rather than a full-service carrier. Technical issues with the 737 MAXs saw the aircraft's flight-control system automatically push down the noses of jets that crashed in 2018 in Indonesia, and in 2019 in Ethiopia.  On October 29, 2018, the Boeing 737 MAX operating the Lion Air Flight 610 crashed into the Java Sea 13 minutes after takeoff, killing all 189 passengers and crew.  It was the first major accident involving the new Boeing 737 MAX series of aircraft, introduced in 2017, and the highest death toll of any accident or incident involving the entire Boeing 737 series. Five months later, on March 10, 2019, the Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft which operated Ethiopian flight 302 crashed near the town of Bishoftu, Ethiopia, six minutes after takeoff, killing all 157 people aboard. It is Ethiopian Airlines' deadliest accident to date. ",
  "c1aff68349d77b2f424aabc152157e313e921667641539cfaaa6ff6d": "Former president Donald Trump held a rally in Nebraska on Sunday, where he spoke for almost two hours and attempted to make the case for voters to elect a Republican gubernatorial candidate who is accused of sexually assaulting several women. Trump appeared alongside Charles Herbster, an embattled local businessman who is now a Nebraska candidate for governor. Last month, the Nebraska Examiner reported that eight women, including a state senator, accused Herbster of touching them inappropriately. But Trump defended Herbster during the rally, which was held in Greenwood, Nebraska, just northeast of Lincoln. 'He's been maligned. He's been badly maligned and it's a shame,' Trump said. 'That's why I came out here. I defend people when I know they're good.' Trump also misspoke at one point, accidentally endorsing the wrong Ohio candidate for Senate. 'We've endorsed Dr. Oz. We've endorsed JP right? JD Mandell. He's doing great.' Venture capitalist JD Vance is running for a senate seat in Ohio, as is former Ohio State Treasurer Josh Mandel. The rally, held at the I-80 Speedway, was postponed from Friday when storms forced the event to be called off.  Herbster helped to advise Trump on his agricultural policy when he was in office. Photographs of the two together feature prominently in Herbster's promotional material.  Herbster also donated to his campaigns. The former president did not hold back on his gushing endorsement.  'He's a good man. He was with us from the beginning. He's been my friend for 30 years, he's an innocent human being.'  Trump even suggested that he was putting himself out by endorsing Herbster and that Friday's cancellation of the rally meant he could have 'easily have gotten out' of coming.  'I could have gotten out of this one real easy. I could have played golf, I could have gone to the beach. And I'm here with Charles W Herbster. I said 'Charles are you are I have to come?'' 'We can't let this stuff happen. By the time he clears himself the election will have happened,' Trump said. Trump's endorsement of Herbster, who has never held public office, is seen as another example of the former president taking a gamble on an ultra-loyalist, rather than better connected opponents. But it could be enough to turn Herbster into a real contender in a state that heavily backed Trump in 2020. 'Charles W. Herbster has been a tremendous supporter of America First and Make America Great Again, right from the beginning,' said Trump in his endorsement. 'He is running for governor of the great state of Nebraska and will do a fantastic job.  'A proud native of Nebraska, Charles is an extraordinarily successful businessman who will fight for our farmers and ranchers, support our military and vets, and protect and defend your under siege Second Amendment rights.' Last month, the Nebraska Examiner reported that eight women, including a state senator, accused Herbster of touching them inappropriately as well as groping. Several women told the paper that Herbster touched them inappropriately as they attended a meet and greet and posed for a photograph. Republican State Senator Julie Slama alleged that Herbster reached up her skirt and touched her inappropriately and without consent as she walked by him in a crowded ballroom in 2019. A former aide to a state senator, Elizabeth Todsen, alleged Herbster grabbed her buttocks at the same event. Before Trump spoke, Herbster took to the stage took a moment to address the allegations suggesting they had come about because the 'political establishment' did not want him to win. 'They are trying to scare me out of this race and it's not going to happen. We are going to take back Nebraska,' Herbster said. Herbster has released a series of television ads denying the accusations. 'I respect all women, all females across this land,' Herbster said. 'The number of calls and text messages and prayers coming in to me has been absolutely overwhelming.' Herbster's campaign mirrors a line used by Trump as he promises to 'make Nebraska great again'. Trump said Herbster was 'a very good man.' Herbster took to the stage on Sunday speaking for around half an hour on several topics, including critical race theory.  Herbster promised that he will ensure the controversial topic will not be taught in Nebraska universities. The gubernatorial candidate also outlined his position on illegal immigration.  Herbster said he welcomes immigrants so long as they enter the United States legally. Herbster also talked about China and said he will not allow the country to buy land in the Cornhusker State. He also said he plans to ensure election security in Nebraska. Last month it was revealed how an email address linked Herbster was used to set up an account on the cheating website Ashley Madison. The address was among millions released by hackers in 2015. The revelation will increase scrutiny of Herbster's troubled campaign. Speaking of the groping allegations, Herbster said the accusations 'lack even a shred of credibility' and have damaged his reputation.  Herbster, a wealthy cattle breeder and loyal Trump ally, launched his candidacy last year and used the email address charles@herbsterangus.com on his official filing with the Nebraska secretary of state. The same address was in the huge trove of Ashley Madison data dumped online by hackers, according to an independent analysis conducted by a cybersecurity expert for DailyMail.com. Log-on information associated with the Herbster email address shows the account was accessed from an IP address linked to Verizon Wireless, at a location that corresponds to Kansas City International Airport. Among Herbster's business interests is Conklin Company, which manufactures more than 130 products, including roofing and agriculture products, such as fertilizers and motor oil, and has its administrative offices in Kansas City, Missouri. He also owns Herbster Angus Farms, a cattle breeding business. In 2019 he spent a record $1.5m on an Angus bull. Proving who used particular email addresses, and whether the user signed up for an Ashley Madison account, is notoriously difficult.  But the charles@herbsterangus.com address is listed in connection with Herbster Angus Farms in directories, as well as documents used to file his run for governor. Herbster has been married twice, and his second wife Judith died in 2017. The details will raise fresh questions for Herbster, whose campaign makes much of his born-again Christian credentials, business experience and relationship with Trump. His campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment until after this story was published. 'This is clearly another attempt by the fake news to smear Charles,' said spokesperson Emily Novotny. 'Charles 100% denies ever using Ashley Madison or creating an account.'   The outgoing Republican governor Pete Ricketts has said Herbster would a 'terrible' choice and has thrown his weight behind rival candidate University of Nebraska regent Jim Pillen.  The rally also saw the participation of two conservative activists who have continued to falsely claim the 2020 election was rigged and stolen from Trump, MyPillow chief executive Mike Lindell and Republican activist David Bossie.  Trump appeared onstage at the rally for almost two hours and went through a 'greatest hits' of talking points.  He spoke freely about the Biden administration's botched withdrawal from Afghanistan last August while praising his own administration's delivery of the coronavirus vaccines through Operation Warp Speed. While speaking about the pandemic Trump he took a moment to mock Chief Medical Advisor Anthony Fauci and his flip-flopping on face masks.  He noted how he did the right thing by supporting Republican governors who decided to keep their states open rather than enforce lockdowns. 'It's the China Virus, whether we like it or not,' he told the crowd. 'I was also right about Wuhan [the Wuhan lab]....I think I was right about everything.'  Trump added: 'What a mess this country's in. Our country's going to hell, but we'll turn it around - we're gonna turn it around.' Trump referred to the coronavirus as the 'China Virus' during his time in office including the  Wuhan lab in China where some believe it originated. At the time, critics bashed the 45th president for referring to it as the 'China' virus but Trump appeared emboldened as he revived the nickname on Sunday eliciting laughter and cheers from the crowd. 'On Covid, we had tremendous success. I rejected mandates, I rejected unscientific lockdowns...and I fought to get our children back into schools.' He added, '[The Democrats are] the party of disinformation...almost everything they say is false.' President Trump said the Biden administration 'imposed horrific mandates, punishing lockdowns, and radical mask regulations.' He got the crowd chanting 'Joe's gotta go' as he criticized the Biden's administration's handling of the war in Ukraine.  'This could be a very dangerous thing where we have incompetent people running things. I never realized how important being president was until we have someone who goes over to Europe and embarrasses our country.' 'Joe Biden and the radical left have turned calm into chaos, competence into incompetence, stability into anarchy, prosperity into poverty and security into catastrophe, otherwise they're doing a fantastic job.    Trump then went on to attack Joe Biden's cognitive state during the energetic rally. He called on Biden to 'put the question to rest by taking a cognitive test.'  'Just look at the video of Joe Biden attempting to speak last week very tough to Russia and Putin,' he began as he played a clip of Biden stumbling over his words and appearing confused.  'We have a president right now, sadly, who has absolutely no idea what the hell is happening. He's shaking hands with the air; he's walking around somewhat bewildered.  'What a mess this country's in...but we'll turn it around...I just hope it's not too late in some respects,' Trump mused. Getting back on track, Trump returned to the remarks written in his teleprompter. 'The election was rigged and stolen. Such stupid decisions are being made because of it, including the border, including Afghanistan. 'Our movement must continue to pursue a populist and nationalist economic agenda that puts working families before globalist politicians, that are fools, and corrupt multinational corporations,' Trump said to cheers at one point.   Trump also spoke about transgender issues briefly during the his 105 minute long rally. 'One of our top priorities must be to defend parent's rights. You see what's going on. No teacher should ever be allowed to teach transgender to our children without parental consent... We will save our kids and we will also keep men out of women's sports.'  Trump shared his thoughts on voters and elections in California calling the Golden State a 'winnable state.'  Trump said 'millions and millions and millions' of allegedly fraudulent paper ballots were the reason California had been a Democratic 'blue' state for so long. 'You know, you take California. I think we do much better in California...you know they all say that you lose by, automatically, by millions of votes. I don't believe that.  'I went to California for just one rally...I never saw a crowd like that...this crowd was massive,' Trump explained.  'I don't believe California's not a winnable state...I think if you had a fair election, I think it's a very winnable state. I think there are a lot of winnable states...I don't think they'd [the Democrats] win at all if we had fair elections,' Trump said to cheers. ",
  "85677dd30819963b62c0e87cf5cb8327893f57577453a6c5d24e28be": "There are calls for Bunnings to remove popular glue trap products from the shelves as disturbing photos emerge of native wildlife getting stuck to them  Concerns have been raised by wildlife advocacy group Wild Animals Australia over the killing of native wildlife, as a result of being caught in these particular traps.  'Animals have been known to tear off, or bite through, their own limbs in an attempt to free themselves,' the organisation claims. More than 38,000 Australians have signed a Change.org petition calling for the products to be removed from the country's biggest hardware store.  One signatory, Maureen Cudmore, said: 'How horrific does this have to be before retailers and others such Bunnings have some care for our beautiful wildlife?' Another, Trudi Nesbitt, said the country's wildlife is already at risk from natural predators, floods and fire, adding: 'Please stop this insanity Bunnings!' Bunnings are not removing the sticky traps from the shelves but stressed they are designed for indoor use only.  In a statement, Adrian Pearce, Bunnings general manager for merchandise, said the warehouse understands there is a range of views about sticky traps and glue traps. 'We continue to work with our suppliers and the regulatory bodies to ensure we are well-informed on these products,' Pearce said.  Mr Pearce also noted Bunnings doesn't sell glue traps designed to catch rodents, 'which we understand can be purchased at other retailers.'  The store does offer a range of insect control products, which includes smaller sticky insect traps and non-sticky insect traps, such as the Yates Indoor fly trap, Envirosafe fly trap or Gepro Mile Bottle fly trap. Most of the sticky insect traps that they offer are designed for indoor use only, as stated on the product packaging. Mr Pearce stated they are working with suppliers to include additional information on the packaging, which they are aiming to roll this out before the end of the year. Bunnings have said they are careful to ensure the sticky insect traps they offer, meet all government standards across all states and territories of Australia. They will continue to closely follow the advice of Agriculture Victoria, other state regulatory bodies, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA), and work with their suppliers to innovate in this area. Wildlife advocates are also calling for businesses including eBay and Amazon to stop selling glue traps. 'No creature deserves this fate'.  ",
  "925c571ee3a4906d772acb949bfe337bd5b23881cd0bfaf30f1433b6": "Bookmakers claim Labor is closing in on election victory with the Coalition drifting out to big odds to remain in power.  Despite a difficult start to the campaign for hopeful Anthony Albanese, the ALP are firm $1.38 favourites to win the federal election outright, according to Sportsbet. Scott Morrison's Coalition have blown out to $3 to hold onto government, with the betting agency telling Daily Mail Australia one punter recently plunged $80,000 on a Labor victory.  However, the latest Newspoll published in The Australian on Monday showed 45 per cent of respondents believe Mr Morrison would make the better prime minister, while only 39 per cent believed Mr Albanese would do a better job.  According to that poll, Labor is leading the government by 53 per cent to 47 per cent on a two-party preferred basis, three weeks out from the federal election. If realised, the Coalition could lose 10 seats at the May 21 election. Asked if it was time for a change of government, the poll of 1,538 voters taken between April 27 and 30 found 56 per cent agreed and 44 per cent said the Coalition should be returned. A Resolve poll of 1408 voters published in Nine newspapers on Monday closely mirrored the Newspoll result, finding Labor leading on a two-party basis at 54 per cent to 46 per cent. Mr Morrison was ahead on the preferred prime minister measure at 39 per cent to 33 per cent. Bookies say they're seeing the majority of money coming for the opposition, particularly in derivative bets including seats. 'We're now seeing a fair bit more turnover on Labor than the Coalition in every metric,' Simon Legg from Sportsbet said.  'The opposite was true up until a few weeks ago.  'Polls and the punters think the Coalition won't be re-elected, because at the halfway point of the campaign, the needle doesn't seem to have moved much in favour of Scott Morrison.' However, just as was the case with the polls, Bill Shorten was a strong favourite to win the 2019 election - before Mr Morrison engineered a late charge and secured a famous victory for the Liberal Party. It was a costly mistake for betting companies. Sportsbet paid out all bets on Mr Shorten winning in 2019 - seeing them lose out on at least $5.2million. They say 70 per cent of the money had come for Labor that year. The then-Labor leader was an incredibly short favourite at $1.16, with Aussie billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes, a climate activist who made his money with tech company Atlassian, losing a mammoth $1million bet he placed on Ladbrokes. Experts are picking a closer margin of victory in the 2022 election, but there is still confidence Labor will win the vote. 'At the last election, people expected a Labor romp, but that's not necessarily the case for this campaign, and we were seeing that up until polls closed in 2019,' SportsBet's Simon Legg told Daily Mail Australia.  'We expect this one to be quite a close result at this stage that narrowly favours Anthony Albanese.' The betting company currently has Labor winning a 77-seat majority, with 51.5 per cent of the money coming for the opposition at the moment - up from 45 per cent a few weeks ago. 'They've never been at that level before,' Mr Legg said. 'Money is coming for Labor in the form of big and small bets. We took a large bet of $80k on Labor late last week, and we're seeing lots of $5k-$10k-$20k bets as well.' SportsBet admitted they 'learned our lesson' from the early payout on Labor in 2019 and won't be offering the same promo this year. ",
  "863425e98bc37eadac4ddff260f1695f29e618f0feec612fc17304d0": "Melissa Caddick sent one of her clients an innocent photo of her pet dog that unknowingly revealed the fraudster was making $46,000 a day. Caddick took the photo of her cocker spaniel Peter Pan resting on her arm while she worked at her computer desk. She sent it over to one of the investors she was managing in an elaborate Ponzi scheme that she operated to fleece family, friends and her parents out of $23million. Journalist Kate McClymont said the photo was hiding an important detail about her financial situation as she made the revelation on her podcast, 'Liar Liar: Melissa Caddick and the Missing Millions'.  Caddick was resting her arm on a piece of paper where she had recorded a daily profit of $46,000 in May 2020. It meant the serial fraudster would have made $1.426million in just one month. Australian Securities and Investments Commission investigators say Caddick made $7.8 million the year she disappeared - making it her most profitable.  McClymont revealed Caddick had been forging her father-in-law's signature to sign off on financial documents and that he had become increasingly suspicious of her. 'He was an accountant. In any conversation he had with her, she became very cagey and changed the topic if it got onto anything financial,' she told Today on Monday. 'After her fraud was exposed he found out she had been forging his signature. When she needed a Justice of the Peace to sign offical documents, there's father-in-law's forged signature.'   McClymont said Caddick's disappearance was still being probed by detectives after she went missing from her Dover Heights home in November 2020. She said the investors who were ripped off have been interviewed to rule out foul play with bizarre theories emerging about what really happened to the fraudster. 'I get the theories every single day,' she said. 'I have seen her in a wheelchair in Israel, she's on a Greek island, she has changed into a man, she's got a beard now.' Caddick outlined her 'eight golden rules' for choosing the right financial advisor while plotting how she would steal millions from her own innocent clients. The fraudster lied about her qualifications and never held a license as a financial advisor when she tricked dozens into 'investing' their life savings. Caddick instead spent their hard-earned dollars on maintaining her extravagant lifestyle, purchasing luxury clothing, designer goods and flashy sports cars. She had lied that she had a master's in business and was part of the Financial Planning Association of Australia in a bid to reel in more clients. She fleeced her closest family and friends, including her parents, of millions, leaving behind an accumulative debt of close to $23million. Caddicks' eight golden rules were published during her time with the now-defunct company Wise Financial Services, where she worked in 2003-2004. The company won best financial practice of the year in Independent Financial Adviser magazine in 2003. Her role at the firm also saw Caddick splashed across the front page of the publication underneath the headline 'A Wise Choice'.    The disappearance of brazen high-rolling conwoman Melissa Caddick after stealing more than $20million to fund her glamorous lifestyle has quickly become one of Australia's greatest unsolved mysteries. In less than 18 months, it has consumed news headlines, been the subject of countless podcasts, YouTube clips, social media threads and spurred a television miniseries. In months and years to come, you can bet we'll see a lot more - book deals signed, docudramas, and even a movie. Although Caddick is long gone from her Wallangra Road mansion in Sydney's eastern suburbs, where she was last seen on November 13, 2020, the public remains fascinated by her disappearance, not just in Australia but also worldwide. With Caddick missing, many of her secrets remain hidden, but for how long? Here are some of the questions we all want to be answered - and how likely they are to be ever solved. Secret one: Could Melissa Caddick be alive? Could she be alive? Yes. Is she alive? Very, very unlikely - but the lack of definite answers will continue to fuel speculation. While police suspect she is deceased, she has not officially been declared dead. The NSW Coroner's Court confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that the 'inquest into the disappearance & suspected death of Melissa Louise Caddick' remains before the court. The matter is expected to return to the coroner's court this year, although no further hearing dates have yet been set. A post-mortem examination of the foot found at Bournda Beach on the NSW south coast on February 21, 2021 - and matched to her DNA - proved inconclusive. An affidavit signed by ASIC's Isabella Allen last May said it was 'unclear at this stage if the pathologist can determine the condition of the remains'. Tellingly, NSW Police confirmed to Daily Mail Australia on April 7 that they consider the investigation closed. 'I can confirm the NSW Police Force investigation into the disappearance of Melissa Caddick has been finalised,' a NSW Police spokeswoman said in a statement. 'A coronial brief of evidence was submitted to the NSW State Coroner on Friday 17 September 2021.' Last May, Detective Sargent Michael Foscholo, of Paddington police, lodged a 'Report of Suspected Death to the Coroner' in Caddick's case. He noted she is no longer on any missing person registers. A month before that, in April 2021 - two months after her detached foot washed up - her family held a private funeral service at Matraville, Sydney. Secret two: What happened to the money Melissa Caddick stole? Melissa Caddick stole at least $23million from 72 investors via her fake financial advice firm Maliver. She used much of the missing millions - by some estimates up to $40million - to fund an expensive lifestyle including buying expensive overseas holidays, jewellery, sports cars, high fashion label dresses and shoes and artworks. Police records detailed some of her extraordinary spending, including $250,000 with fashion label Christian Dior and $50,000 with Chanel. She spent hundreds of thousands on jewellery, with one report a single diamond ring from Canturi jewellery she owned cost $300,000. She took overseas holidays, often flying first class. For example, she spent $120,000 on flights to go skiing at Aspen, Colorado and $63,000 on just two trips to Fiji. She even spent $25,000 on protein shakes. As Caddick operated a Ponzi scheme via her company Maliver, by definition, she would have used some investors' funds to make her scam look successful. As she got hold of funds from new investors, she would make payments to earlier ones - encouraging them to invest even more. But Caddick had assets that are currently the subject of a Federal Court case as investors seek redress. The court ruled Jones Partners could sell her assets to pay the investors, including a 'significant' share portfolio, money held in bank accounts and vehicles. In February, her husband Anthony Koletti's blue convertible Audi R8 V10 was sold off at an auction for $295,000, and Caddick's black Mercedes Benz CLA45 AMG went for $66,000. Mr Koletti protested the sale, although court records showed she bought it for him on May 6, 2016, for $390,000. The $361,250 from the sale of the cars will be distributed amongst her defrauded investors. The liquidators also hope to sell two properties she bought. Her Wallangra Road home at Dover Heights is valued at $9million, and she bought a penthouse at Edgecliff for her parents, valued at $2.5million. Secret three: Did Melissa Caddick have an escape plan after ASIC raided her Dover Heights home? When Caddick disappeared on November 13, 2020, it looked certain she had a getaway plan. When her foot washed up on Bournda Beach in February, 2021, it either ended the escape plan theories or took them up a notch - depending on your imagination. The point of the television miniseries, Underbelly: Vanishing Act, was to convert public fascination with her disappearance into TV audiences by dramatizing her supposed escape. The show explored theories, including that she had a 'safehouse' on the NSW south coast where she stashed cash, that she was picked up by a yacht and she chopped off her own foot. None have been proved true, and all appear to be little more than storytelling. The theory about her disappearance makes the most sense is that after ASIC raided her Dover Heights home on November 12, 2020 she took her own life. But conspiracy theorists rightly point out this hasn't been proved either. Many people find it unthinkable that a meticulous fraudster like Caddick would not have had a plan ready to go for it, and when it appeared, she might be busted. But what could it have been? Secret four: Did Melissa Caddick fake her own death? Probably the most tantalizingly popular question for all who have followed the Melissa Caddick saga. This is impossible to know - in theory it's possible, but regarded as extremely unlikely. 'It's possible [she's alive], at the extreme end of what's possible, in that what's been recovered is a foot and medically you can survive without a foot,' criminologist Dr Xanthe Mallett told Daily Mail Australia. 'I know fact is stranger than fiction, however I don't think we can stretch the fact this far. While people have faked their own deaths before, the emergence of her foot complicates any wild escape theory in more than the obvious way. But it still didn't prevent speculation. Even the NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller added to it. There's always a chance she cut her foot off and is still alive, though it's pretty fanciful,' he told 2GB in March 2021. 'A severed foot is a great throw off.' Secret five: Did Melissa Caddick sail off in a yacht or hop on an early morning flight? The yacht scenario was made up by the producers of Underbelly: Vanishing Act. Caddick did not have a passport in another name and all five of her known passports were handed over by her husband in the days after she disappeared. This would make leaving the country via plane highly unlikely. But one theory the show puts forward is that Caddick had given a mysterious yacht captain a payment to ferry her out of the country as her 'plan B'. In the show this falls apart when her husband holds a press conference and she becomes the most high profile missing person in the country. There has been no suggestion of any such yacht in the official investigation. It is understood police in their investigations are satisfied Caddick did not depart Sydney. Secret six: Could cutting off your foot work as a getaway plan? Again, in theory, it's possible but extremely unlikely. Because a foot amputation was featured in the horror movie Saw, it has been discussed at length online. Generally, doctors have said a DIY foot amputation without the best medical help immediately at hand is not survivable. Arterial bleeding means the person who lost a foot would die within an hour, passing out through shock and ultimately through loss of blood. The counterview is that people have survived the sudden and traumatic loss of limbs, including feet - and more - during war. So while unlikely, it is true to say surviving a foot amputation is possible because there are living examples. Secret seven: Was Melissa Caddick murdered? Underbelly: Vanishing Act show posited that Caddick was involved with a fictitious underworld figure called George. In the show, Caddick 'runs into' him on her morning jogs along the cliff where she later allegedly jumped. These characters appear to be either fictional or composite characters that serve a plot purpose rather than based on any specific people known to Caddick. George is depicted as a 'gangster', who screenwriter Matt Ford invented. However, it is understood that in police circles, there is a feeling that Caddick may have been murdered. It is a theory shared by criminologist Dr Xanthe Mallett. 'Based on her personality profile I don't thinks she's likely to have committed suicide,' Dr Mallett said. 'I think the most likely outcome is she was sadly murdered, second that she took her own life and third is that she's still alive.' Anthony Koletti believes it too. He told Channel Seven's Spotlight program it would 'make sense' she was murdered. But by who? 'My suspect list is long,' he said. 'If it came out, if the police came to me and said 'Melissa was murdered', I'd be like 'it makes sense'.' Secret eight: How did Melissa Caddick's foot get severed and how was it found intact 450 kilometres away four months after she disappeared? The unforgettable image of a single Asics shoe sitting on Bournda Beach with the foot itself blurred out by photo editors so that viewers don't lose the lunches is now iconic. It is the most gruesome and intriguing part of the whole Caddick mystery, even more than her possible death. The image is so unforgettable that the makers of Underbelly: Vanishing Act couldn't help but show us what it might have really looked like: totally disgusting. How the shoe and foot got to Bournda beach and why it took over three months - presuming it became detached after she leapt to her death from the Dover Heights clifftop - is the subject of much speculation. One expert, Dr Paola Magni from Murdoch University, claimed the shoe found with her foot in it should have had 'barnacles' on it after three months floating in the ocean. 'November to now is summer time so the water is pretty warm with a lot of plankton, full of little creatures that are extremely active because of the warm water,' she told The Daily Telegraph. 'I would have expected something on the shoe ... based on my experience.' Secret nine: What do police know about Melissa Caddick that that they aren't saying? Without doubt, a lot. They collected mountains of evidence from her home, several laptops, and statements from her family members and defrauded investors for over a year. There were also hundreds of supposed sightings claimed after her disappearance. But on April 7 police told Daily Mail Australia they now consider the case 'finalised' - so we may never know what they suspect really happened. At times, top cops have let slip and expressed doubts over the popular story: that she took her life after ASIC raided her home. Back in March 2021, police commissioner Mick Fuller sounded sceptical over the appearance of her foot. 'Of all the beaches and feet in the world, to find hers... what is the probability of that?' he in an interview with 2GB. 'I've never seen someone's body or body parts wash up 400km south of Sydney and in reasonably good condition ... but that's not to say it can't happen.' Secret ten: How could Melissa Caddick live with herself after ripping off family and friends? In a little over two years to September 2020, more than $20million was deposited into her personal bank accounts by 72 investors - who were mostly friends and family. It was later revealed her scam involved creating a fake CommSec share trading account number - with six digits instead of the eight numbers the real accounts have. She didn't even have a real financial advisor's licence. She got female friends, family members and acquaintances to invest by boasting of 30 per cent returns and by showing off her millionaire lifestyle. She promised she could do the same for them. Except none of it was real: she didn't make any money, she stole it. Her lifestyle was a shopfront for her scam, all of it rooted in deception. Along the way it is likely Caddick accepted the guilt as a cost of her dishonest business model. Most of us couldn't do this, but then again most of us are not con-artists. As one of the investigative journalists who has covered the case since the start, Kate McClymont, says in Nine newspapers, Caddick was a narcissist. That means she may have had no empathy for her victims, a sense of entitlement, and an inflated sense of self-importance and a preoccupation with the fantasy of unlimited success. Secret eleven: How much does Melissa Caddick's second husband Anthony Koletti know? Since her disappearance, the spotlight has not shone on Mr Koletti, 41, her second husband, a former hairdresser, DJ and part-time prawn farmer. While Mr Koletti is not accused of any wrongdoing, observers of the mystery have questioned why he did not publicly do more to try and find her initially. It is also understood Mr Koletti was not anxiously contacting police for updates on their investigation, 9News reported last year. As for whether Mr Koletti knows more than he's let on, it is widely believed he was just as blindsided by the raid and her disappearance as everyone else. His own father, Rodo Koletti, doubts his son knew about his wife's scams. 'Anthony is a hairdresser. I don't believe he has the capacity to know what a financial scheme is. I don't think he could have been in it at all or known what was going on,' he told 9News. He has repeatedly claimed his wife is not a conwoman, despite the mountain of evidence stacked against her. In a scathing letter he wrote, which was included in court documents in the Federal court case dealing with the receiver's attempts to recoup some of the money she stole, Mr Koletti denied ASIC's claims. In it, he maintained, 'Melissa lost investor funds trading on the stock market which is clearly visible through her AustralianCommsec trading account.' ASIC found she falsified documents to make investors believe shares in their names were being held in Commsec accounts. But the accounts didn't exist. In the same letter, Mr Koletti accused ASIC investigator Isabella Allen of 'severe negligence and inhumane treatment' of his wife and of being the reason that people may never know if she was murdered or took her life. ASIC removed CCTV cameras from the Dover Heights home during the raid the previous day. 1. Is the financial advisor and the organisation accredited? Generally, a financial advisor and their organisation has to be recognised by a governing body as being appropriately governed and ethical. 2. Is the advisor compliant with recent government legislation? Government rules and regulations surrounding the financial services industry have recently undergone hefty reforms and financial advisors not only have to be aware of the changes, but implement them by a certain timeframe. 3. Is your financial advisor qualified? Ask for some qualifications or some proof of a proven record. Just because you have done a weekend course, it does not mean you are a financial advisor. 4. Does your financial advisor listen? Many so-called advisors are not interested in your particular situation and offer the same solutions no matter what the problem. Be sure your advisor listens and then provides a unique program for your situation. 5. Does your advisor have experience with your particular problem? There is no point visiting an advisor who specialised in superannuation when your problem is debt. Much like question 3, ask for some proof before proceeding. 6. Do you have a rapport with your advisor? In other words, do you feel your advisor understands and want to help you with your financial situation? 7. Ask for references. There is no harm in asking your financial advisor for case studies or testimonials from anonymous clients. 8. How does your advisor charge? Will you be charged based on results or a flat fee? Be sure to understand what kind of fees you will be paying and when you have to pay them.  SOURCE: Melissa Caddick, writing for SheSaid",
  "03e022b97576b3b39cb2a338ae4f9e5167ffe3a7ad452e4e0092945a": "A desperate mother used Scott Morrison's appearance at an Eid event to beg the Prime Minister to help her family flee Afghanistan. Hundreds of Muslim worshippers gathered in Parramatta, west Sydney, on Monday morning for Eid prayers to mark the end of Ramadan. Mr Morrison attended the event alongside community members from the nearby Parramatta Mosque and delivered a speech to the hundreds of worshippers in attendance. After the prayers, tearful Afghan mother Hijara Taufiq approached the prime minister. While surrounded by a mob of people Ms Taufiq begged Mr Morrison in broken English to help her brother's family flee the Taliban in Afghanistan.  'I want help,' she said. 'My family in Afghanistan. They now not have passport, visa.' Ms Taufiq explained her family has been unable to migrate to Australia because of problems with their paperwork. She also said her family's lives were in danger and that one of her nephew's legs had been 'broken' by the Taliban. The Taliban seized control of Afghanistan following the retreat of allied forces - including Australia - last year. The militant group's previous reign in the 1990s was marked by the violent oppression of women and the nation being used as a base for al Qaeda to strike the United States on September 11, 2001. Ms Taufiq said 'school is over' for her four nieces - as in, they are no longer allowed to go to class - and begged the prime minister to hurry the processing of their visas so her family can live in safety. The federal government has allotted 26,500 spots in its humanitarian program to help refugees from Afghanistan but over 180,000 applications have clogged Department of Home Affairs' processing systems. Mr Morrison directed Ms Taufiq to the Liberal Party's candidate for Parramatta, Maria Kovacic for help. 'Maria will be able to work with you, we are bringing thousands and thousands of people from Afghanistan,' he said. 'We will do everything we can.'  Immigration Minister Alex Hawke also attended the event alongside the PM. Prior to the heartbreaking conversation, Mr Morrison delivered a speech to the hundreds of worshippers.  During his speech the prime minister compared the end of Ramadan to the easing of Covid measures across the country. 'Breaking this fast is a little like what the country is now going through, after two years of incredible difficult times' he told the crowd. 'Now we can see the dawn breaking. We can reflect as we go into this new period with hope, restored by our faith and by our community.' Mr Morrison also praised the country's large multicultural population.  'Australia is like a rope, with many different strands that weave together to make it incredibly strong,' he said. Mr Morrison was later photographed handing out colourful bags containing lollies and a bubble wand to children to celebrate Eid festivities. Former prime minister Kevin Rudd was also a guest at the event, alongside Labor candidate for Parramatta Andrew Charlton. The government announced on Monday it would expand access to the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card.  An extra 50,000 older Australians will gain access to the concession should the coalition get re-elected, with the threshold for singles being lifted from $57,761 to $90,000 from July 1. The couples threshold will also rise from $92,416 to $144,000. Meanwhile, the government remains behind in the latest Newspoll, continuing to trail Labor 47-53 on two-party preferred basis.",
  "2c74f7c75714422626cd807397eb3bd41123f59ff65ab32ca0f6aecd": "Lawyers are set to file over 100 new claims against Hertz on behalf of customers who say they were victims of false arrests because the company's computer system erroneously reported their rental cars to police as stolen. The new claims come despite promises from the company's CEO just this month to fix what he called a glitch in the system causing the false reports.  Stephen Scherr, who took over as CEO on Feb. 28, said the company has changed its practices to fix problems that have occurred when cars were reported stolen but the transaction was improperly recorded in Hertz's system. However, another 100+ cases are set to be filed to add to the more than 230 to date, which have sought over $750million in damages. Some of these new cases are being filed as civil cases separate from the bankruptcy proceeding because the incidents happened after Hertz got out of bankruptcy. The allegations have caught the attention of Congress, who are demanding the Federal Trade Commission investigate.   Michael Okoasia, 29, a music video director from New York City, said he was the victim of this Hertz 'glitch' after renting a 2019 Nissan Versa from the company at the LAX Marriott Hotel in California.  Okoasia claims he was headed to a video shoot when he was pulled over and arrested at gunpoint by 10 officers. 'Hertz had rented me the wrong car and then without any investigation reported the car I was driving stolen. I was eventually let go, and the car towed, but not before a very public arrest in Hollywood,' Okoasia said in a legal filing. 'I had to tell the production team I had been arrested for being in possession of a stolen car.'  He's claiming losses of about $20,000 because he was unable to shoot the music video he was supposed to work on, as well as airfare expenses.  Brittany Morgan and Jeremy Benjamin were also pulled over at gunpoint in Houston recently after renting a Ford Mustang from Hertz's George Bush Airport location. 'We showed the police the paperwork and told them we had obviously not stolen the car. We were stunned when the police told us that the license plate on our car was from another car that was reported stolen and that it was not even the license plate listed on our rental paperwork,' the couple wrote in their legal declaration.  'We are infuriated that something like this could happen, and dumbfounded to learn that Hertz has previously rented 'stolen' cars to customers,' they added. Hertz claims that it files over 3,000 police reports annually, saying that most of the reports are for customers who were 'many weeks or even months overdue returning vehicles and who stopped communicating with us well beyond the scheduled due date.' But Scherr said earlier in April that he'd been working to fix a glitch in the rental-car giant's systems that has led to some of its customers being wrongly accused of stealing cars they had rented. 'This is among the first things that I have started to look to take care of and deal with in the first 30 days I've been at the company,' Scherr told CNBC on Monday. 'It is not acceptable to Hertz to have any customer ... caught up in some of what has happened.' Some Hertz customers have said they were arrested and jailed because the company accused them of stealing cars that they had paid to rent and in some cases had returned long before their arrest. It's not clear how many people have been affected. More than 200 customers asked a federal judge in Delaware to Hertz to disclose records about erroneous theft reports, and the judge ruled in the renters' favor in February. Scherr said the false reports involve several hundred customers out of Hertz's 15 million annual transactions, but lawyers for the customers say the number is more like 8,000. 'We have changed our policies to avoid the possibility of this happening again,' Scherr said. 'No one customer should be put through that.' Scherr said that in some cases, vehicles have been reported as stolen, the report was withdrawn when the vehicle was found, 'but that rescission wasn't recognized.' Francis Malofiy, an attorney for the victims, told FOX Business that the company's recent comments are 'discordant' with reality and 'frustrating for a lot of people who are still being arrested, jailed and prosecuted for false police reports.' 'There's a massive world of difference between something that's lost or misplaced or that you can't find and something that's stolen,' he added.",
  "1f804cb5f04911c014285b9e70174b1f88fd6932f0f6ff973995066b": "A New York City plastic surgeon is being sued for allegedly forcing an employee to work while she was COVID-positive, even asking her to fake test results to get back to the office.  Dr. Ryan Neinstein, who operates out of the Bergdorf Goodman building on the Upper East Side and has an Instagram account with 40,000 followers, is being accused of constantly texting staffer Christina Flores, 33, to try and get her back to work.  Flores said she had only been working for Neinstein about a month when she contracted COVID in December 2020, just prior to the vaccine rollout.  She says her boss told her to work from home even as her condition got worse , according to a filing made in Manhattan Supreme Court. 'Every day was constant calls, texts, emails,' Flores told The New York Post. 'He was relentless and the more I tried to work through it, it just wasn't good enough for him.'  The suit accuses Neinstein of demanding Flores use nasal rinse and 'virus-killing' nose swabs in an attempt produce a false negative test to get her back to work.   She felt she was targeted by Neinstein when she finally did return to the office.   'He gets away with it,' Flores, who said she was fearful of losing her job, alleges. 'He's a plastic surgeon in Manhattan. He feels he has money and power.' 'I had no choice but to abide by his command,' she added. On December 4, 2020, just three days after receiving her positive test and while registering a high fever and headaches, Neinstein texted her, according to court documents: '[the office's] voicemail does not work...I don't care what you're doing. I want it fixed in next 15 minutes,' the suit claims. He texted her again later in the day: 'I understand you're sick, but if you can't do your job I will find someone else.' As she continued to remain COVID-positive, on December 21, she alleges Neinstein asked her to go through the process of obtaining the false positive, which she refused. She tested negative four days later on Christmas and returned to work shortly thereafter but things continued to be tense with Neinstein. 'I returned back to work and I felt like was a target for him,' Flores said. 'He treated me so poorly. He always talked down to me. It was never good enough. 'I felt like it was retaliation because I had time off,' Flores added. 'But I was working from home. I never took the time off.' Flores also accuses Neinstein of interviewing her for a job opportunity (that she passed on before eventually accepting) while he was conducting liposuction on an unconscious patient.  'How he interviewed me while a poor patient was on the table not aware,' she said. 'And how he treated me when I had COVID.' She eventually moved on to another employer but Neinstein filed legal action against Flores herself, saying she poached employees from him after leaving in a March 2021 filing.   Flores' lawyer Matthew Blit says the suit is frivolous and he's filed a motion to toss the case. 'This profit-hungry doctor risked the lives of every employee and patient while unlawfully discriminating against Ms. Flores,' Blit said. 'Because Ms. Flores bravely refused to fake a covid test she was retaliated against in a clearly frivolous lawsuit for millions of dollars that will be immediately tossed by the court.' 'Ms. Flores' ultimate victory will serve as a deterrent to other scoundrels out there that want to illegally jeopardize the health and safety of their clients and employees,' he added. An attorney for Neinstein, Steve Polyakov, denies the allegations.   'Neinstein Plastic Surgery, PLLC is an equal opportunity employer. We take allegations of discrimination and harassment seriously.' 'We deny all of Ms. Flores's allegations of wrongdoing and look forward to the opportunity to establish a complete and factually accurate account of the underlying events,' Polyakov added.",
  "4e88992b71103eddcad0c784b1801abd538b6cf03dc4e9f6b8f86821": "A New Zealand thug who crushed the face of a young reveller with a sack of stubbies must remain in Australia for the next two-and-a-half years to serve the community.  Jonathan Ewington, 39, was sentenced in the County Court of Victoria on Monday to the community corrections order for his savage 2019 attack on gatecrasher Tyson St Jacques.  Mr St Jacques, aged 21 at the time, had gone to the Rancho Relaxo music festival at Hastings on the Mornington Peninsula with a group of friends - but they were quickly asked to leave because they didn't have tickets to the private event. The court heard the Melbourne-born Ewington, who had travelled to the event from New Zealand, jumped a fence to attack his victim on the mistaken belief he had nicked his sack of beers from the party.  Mr St Jacques and his four mates had only moments earlier been asked to leave the private event by security guards, who instantly noticed the group had not been wearing the required wristbands to enter the festival.  The group left without incident, but Ewington decided to take matters into his own hands all the same.  The court heard he scaled a fence to remonstrate with the rejected party goers.  'What's in the f**king bag,' he shouted while charging at Mr St Jacques.  While Mr St Jacques' mate dropped his bag and ran, he stopped and held out his to allow Ewington to inspect what was inside.  The court heard Ewington grabbed the bag and continued to chase down the fleeing gatecrasher.  When Mr St Jacques attempted to retrieve his sack of beers, Ewington cracked him in the face with it.  The impact caused catastrophic injuries to Mr St Jacques face, breaking his jaw and sending at least one tooth flying.  Over the next three days he was treated at hospital for his fractured jaw and the dislocation of at least seven other teeth.  The court heard Mr St Jacques would likely require years of ongoing treatment, with three more teeth at risk of coming out.  Ewington faced up to 15 years in jail for the brutal attack on his young victim.  About 200 guests had attended the private festival.  Upon his arrest, Ewington told police he believed the gatecrashers had pilfered tents of wallets, mobile phones and his own passport.  He claimed while he never did check the contents of the sack he used as a weapon, he did recognise it had something heavy within it.  Ewington maintained for years he had acted in self defence before accepting a plea deal to a lesser charge on the eve of his trial.  In pleading guilty to recklessly causing serious injury, Ewington pledged to pay for all of his victim's medical expenses, despite being unemployed and now having to move to Melbourne.  The court heard Ewington had dreams of becoming a pro snowboarder before he was involved in a car crash that caused him a brain injury.  Forced to work as a concreter, Ewington had spent the past seven years living in Wanaka where he lived with his partner and looked after his sick mum.   In sentencing Ewington to the community order, which includes 350 hours of unpaid work, Judge Simon Moglia accepted Ewington was now sorry for the injuries he caused Mr St Jacques.  He further accepted Ewington did not set out to assault his victim and had left him alone after bashing his face in with the stubbies.  'You caused his injuries as you were passing him when you swung the bag backwards at him not knowing he was still very close as you continued to pursue (his friend),' Judge Moglia said.  'Your conduct was certainly reckless was momentary and impulsive.'  Prosecutors had called for Ewington to be jailed, but Judge Mogolia accepted the fact he needed to be in Melbourne to carry out the community order was punishment enough.  'I agree that this disruption would be very significant indeed,' he said. ",
  "7f3b7092dbd058689828b915bea64d4ce4f151ed254b3ab0d58314e0": "The Barefoot Investor has shared more financial advice after speaking to a top fund manager whose performance shows the less you do, the better your returns. Financial expert Scott Tape recently shared the advice after speaking with his 'hero' Steve Edmunson, an American fund manager. Mr Edmunson manages the Nevada Public Employees Retirement System Fund, which is worth an astonishing $82 billion and has been in the top 10 per cent of US superfunds for the last ten years. Mr Pape asked Mr Edmunsun what his 'edge' was which made his investment strategy so successful. 'Well, I don't do a lot', Mr Edmunsun responded. Pape explained the hedge fund matter does not do any 'frantic buying or selling, just sitting and holding.' Mr Edmunsun explained further: 'I think in the world of investing the spotlight goes to the latest hot new strategy, but there isn't much emphasis on what you don't do. If you've got a long-term horizon, like we do, the best thing to do is usually nothing,' he said. Mr Pape agreed writing: 'Finance is the only industry in the world where the less you pay, the more you get -- and the less you do, the better your returns'. Mr Edmunson joined the fund 17 years ago and immediately set to work cutting back costs. 'He sacked all the highly paid stock-picking hedge fund managers and replaced them with ultra-low-cost index funds,' Mr Pape explained. 'He has 88% of his portfolio invested in index funds and 12% invested in private equity investments.' Mr Edmunson said he couldn't control investment returns, but he could control the company's costs. 'We keep ours extremely low. Being a lot cheaper than other funds gives us a big head-start,' he said. Australians pay some of the most expensive super fund fees in the world, which amount to more than $30 billion every year. In contrast to Australia's high-rolling fund managers, Mr Edmunson still drives a second-hand car, lives in a small home, and brings his leftovers to work. When asked if wished he reaped more reward from his hard work Mr Edmunson simply said: 'Not at all'.  'Yes, it's an enormous responsibility, but it's that part of the job that makes it so fulfilling. I get to work at a job that helps firefighters, and teachers, and police men and women ... good working-class people. I'd say I'm the luckiest guy around.'",
  "6bec13353aa625c27a8d24724f5e8efa52f3c16acfab45d8747517ed": "A mother has shared the difficult reality of living with three children with Tourette's Syndrome, telling how she has learned to cope with getting hit by her kids every day and dealing with stares from the public.  Mandy Maysey kept a smile on her face as her son Tryxx, 11, involuntarily slapped her as the pair were conducting a live cross to Studio 10 from their Gold Coast home on Monday. Hosts Sarah Harris and Tristan MacManus asked Ms Maysey to describe her day-to-day life in dealing with the condition - a neurological disorder that causes sufferers to have involuntary tics and outbursts. She has two other children - Conor, 27 and Void, 15 - who are also living with Tourette's Syndrome. Ms Maysey said some members of the public made 'snap judgments' about the condition and said her children often had no control over their gestures, which her son, Tryxx, demonstrated by involuntarily slapping her in the face.  'You mean like this?' he said. 'Snap judgement. Snap, snap, snap, snap, snap.' An embarrassed Ms Maysey apologised for her son's behaviour before Harris told her not to worry.  Ms Maysey went on to say her Tryxx's tics intensify when he is excited before she copped more verbal abuse from her son. 'I am not overexcited,' Tryxx yelled. 'You f***er.'  Ms Maysey was then bitten on her arm and hands, labelled a 'b***h' and spat in the face throughout the remainder of the interview. The mother-of-three admitted she was concerned by the number of teachers who had a difficult time managing her son. Tryxx is in Year Six and has 'mixed emotions' about attending high school next year. He said he feared he would be kicked out of the classroom like some of his primary school teachers had done in the past. Tourette's Syndrome is a neurological condition that causes involuntary tics. The condition affects about 1 in 100 kids, yet the cause remains a mystery. Research indicates those under 21 are more commonly affected - as are boys generally more likely than girls to develop the condition. The symptoms are thought to lessen with age, however, those with the condition must learn to manage it for a lifetime.   Ms Maysey, who is the president of the Tourette Syndrome Association, urged the government to provide more support to high school teachers. 'The problem we have with high school is because there's such a high amount of teachers, whereas primary school it's just one or two teachers,' she said. 'You can educate one or two teachers, but when you've got a different teacher for each subject, it just makes it that little bit more complicated.' Ms Maysey reassured there was 'no malice' behind the involuntary tics and that they simply could not be controlled.  'Because of the nature of tics being involuntary, being noisy, they can be seen to be quite obnoxious,' she said. 'What we need is for people to understand is they can't control it. There's no malice behind it.  'If teachers could actually just understand, or any other school staff, could understand.'  Tourette's Syndrome Association president Mandy Maysey revealed there were plenty of resources available to help manage students who were living with Tourette's Sydnrome. Tac'Tics is designed to 'directly support the education and awareness of children living with Tourette Syndrome in schools throughout Australia.  The program is available as an app and is described as an 'immersive digital scavenger hunt with purpose, based on augmented reality and gamification'. Teachers can find the app on the TSAA website.  Tourettes affects about 1 in 100 kids, yet the cause remains a mystery. Research indicates those under 21 are more commonly affected - as are boys generally more likely than girls to develop the condition. The symptoms are thought to lessen with age, however, those with the condition must learn to manage it for a lifetime. The Tourette's at School Report shows one 44 per cent of students living with Tourette's are told off.  One third are sent out of the classroom while a student living with the condition is three times more likely to be suspended. ",
  "1e8b9c7ee103a6b138c98d5a9a74ad8ed537cec45defc67dad42ae0c": "Parents have been reminded to watch their children while applying hand sanitiser because a toxic chemical is some hand sanitizers could be absorbed through the skin. The warning comes amid renewed calls for Australians to keep up Covid safety measures. NSW Health on Sunday urged residents to maintain hygiene protocols as the state recorded 9303 new daily infections and a further five deaths. The department said it was important to use hand sanitiser to 'keep those germs at bay' and offered application advice to ensure the product worked effectively.  'The amount you use matters,' NSW Health tweeted. 'Apply a palmful of alcohol-based sanitiser to cover all surfaces of your hands and rub your hands together using the right technique until they're dry (20-30 seconds).' However, the department warned the disinfectant is dangerous if swallowed, and in some cases can be poisonous - especially for young children.  'Imported hand sanitisers often won't be clearly labelled and may contain methanol and other stronger alcohol products that are even more toxic,' they wrote.  Methanol is one of three types of alcohol used in hand sanitizer products, and consumption of it could cause blindness and death. Some experts fear that the chemical could be absorbed through children's skin, causing long-term health issues. 'Children can actually absorb enough methanol through their skin to be toxic,' said Dr Gregory Poland, an infectious diseases doctor at the Mayo Clinic, to the Globe.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 15 cases of methanol poisoning associated with the use of hand sanitizer in Arizona and New Mexico last year. Four of the patients died, and three had permanent damage to their vision. Overuse of the 'safer' hand sanitizers can have negative effects as well. People overusing hand sanitizer in fear of COVID-19 could produce dangerous vapors that could cause irritate peoples skin and airways, Poland said. Consistent use of the hand sanitizer can also cause skin irritation because of the high alcohol content. 'The skin is like a brick wall,' Dr Abigail Waldman, a dermatologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, told the Globe. 'You have these bricks that protect it and the hand sanitizer does such a good job that often it will create holes in that brick wall.' Bacteria can also eventually develop resistances to hand sanitizer if they are overly exposed to it. 'You can actually get resistance to the hand sanitizer, meaning the flora or the typical bacteria or viruses that you run into will develop resistance against whatever you're using,' Waldman said. NSW Health urged parents to 'always watch young children as they apply hand sanitiser and then put the bottle in a safe place so they can't use it without your supervision. 'If you think your child has swallowed hand sanitiser, even just a small amount, call the 24-hour Poisons Information Centre on 13 11 26 for first aid and monitoring advice [and] have the bottle with you when you call.' The caution comes after the incidence of children being poisoned skyrocketed during the Covid pandemic as hand sanitiser became a popular household item.  In April 2020, New South Wales Poisons Information Centre fielded 164 calls about hand sanitiser poisoning - up from just 65 during the same month the year before. Under the safety guidelines, NSW Health says washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds is ideal, but alcohol-based hand sanitiser should be used when the first option is not available.  'Follow the instructions on the bottle - the amount you use and how long you spend applying it affects how well it works,' the advice continues.  'It's important to remember that if hand sanitiser is left in the heat the alcohol in it will evaporate and it won't work effectively, so don't leave it in the car in hot weather.'    Washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds is a safe and effective option. When you can't wash your hands with soap and water, use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser. Follow the instructions on the bottle - the amount you use and how long you spend applying it affects how well it works. It's important to remember that if hand sanitiser is left in the heat the alcohol in it will evaporate and it won't work effectively, so don't leave it in the car in hot weather.

The 35-year-old woman was left with critical injuries at the Patrick Avenue home at Croydon North, in Melbourne, at 10.15pm on Saturday.  Police had received reports of an assault and screaming coming from the house before they arrived on scene.  A neighbour said they attempted to perform CPR on the woman before emergency services tried to treat her - but she died shortly afterwards. 'Paramedics worked on a woman found with critical injuries,' a police spokesperson said. 'Sadly, the woman -- who is yet to be formally identified -- died at the scene.' Homicide detectives have launched an investigation and continued to question a 40-year-old man. No charges have been made. It is understood the man and woman were in a relationship.  A neighbour told Herald Sun they had heard screaming come from the house.  Another local said the man in custody was a 'nice normal person' and 'they were a quiet family'.  Police taped off the scene as forensic teams carried items away from the house.  Children's toys, including stuffed animal and balls, could be seen in the garage, with police taking a box of the items away.  Daniel Mr Woodrow who lives nearby said he was shocked to stumble across the police presence during his morning walk. 'I have never seen anything like this,' he said.  'I got woken up last night, I got out of bed -- I actually thought it might've been a cat trying to kill a possum, there was a human element to it.' Anyone with further information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or through the website.",

On Monday, the Supreme Court of New South Wales agreed to the judge-only trial.  Dawson, 73, has pleaded not guilty to murdering his wife Lynette on Sydney's northern beaches in January 1982.  He was charged in 2018 following years of public scrutiny.  Dawson had also tried to have the jury trial matter pushed back after revealing he had failed to obtain legal aid funding for his defence.  The ex-rugby league player and teacher had hoped to delay the hearing in the hope it would advance his appeal to be granted public money to mount the defence for his upcoming trial, which is due to commence next week.  The Supreme Court trial is expected to cost Dawson hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal expenses.  Dawson remains free in the community on bail while awaiting trial. Just last week he was spotted out with his third wife Sue after reporting for bail in Maroochydore on Queensland's Sunshine Coast.  She has stuck with Dawson for more than three decades after first meeting him in 1990 or early 1991 when she was a science teacher and he was a PE teacher. They lived at Yeppoon, near Rockhampton, on Queensland's Capricorn Coast.  His trial for the alleged murder of Lynette was given the go-ahead after the High Court of Australia dismissed an application for the matter to be struck out.  Lynette Dawson was 33-years-old when she disappeared in Bayview in Sydney's north, leaving two daughters behind. Her body has never been recovered.   Chris Dawson's trial before Justice Ian Harrison is likely to take up to eight weeks.  ",

The prime minister took a well-earned break from the campaign trail on Sunday evening to cook up a storm for his loved ones. He served up an exotic Sri Lankan tamarind eggplant and okra dish alongside steamed rice and a classic chicken korma with the cheeky caption: 'Strong Curry. Strong Economy. Stronger Future.' But eagle-eyed commenters said his family are also going to need 'strong stomachs' with a portion of the chicken korma appearing dangerously undercooked.  'Pray to god you do not get Salmonella eating the pink raw chicken. Eat Chicken responsibly,' one shocked person urged the PM. 'Be lucky to stay out of hospital,' another said. A third accused the PM of orchestrating a publicity stunt. 'Eeew that's raw chicken!... You didn't even bother cooking that did you? Just pour sauce over raw chicken for yet another photo op.' But not everyone slammed Mr Morrison's skills in the kitchen. Liberal MP Jason Wood gave the home-cooked meal a rave review.  'Looks amazing. I love cooking a chicken curry but alas yours is more impressive'.  Another wrote: 'You really love your curry. I love seeing each time you present your meals it's such a wonderful delight and how lucky is your family.' 'I love it that you cook curry! You're a legend, PM!' a third commented.",
  "f1b978bdc1f9dc56b3412bd1b3aebf11b57ac75fc7efcadd2c6cd870": "A Labor campaign advert narrated by Hollywood superstar Russell Crowe uses foreign stock images filmed overseas.  The minute-long clip voiced by the Gladiator actor shows Mr Albanese meeting Aussies on the campaign trail as well as stock footage of senior Australians and a farmer in a field of wheat. The advert talks about Labor's plan to do better for Australians - but eagle-eyed viewers spotted some of the clips were from other countries which Labor simply bought from the internet rather than filming in Australia. These include an elderly lady filmed in the US, a man in a wheelchair filmed in Canada, and a farmer walking through fields of wheat which appears to be from Slovenia.  The clip of the farmer and the man in a wheelchair are available to buy from New York based stock image company Pond5. An image of an elderly woman is listed on stock image company Shutterstock under the title 'Portrait of an old lonely human who looks out the window from the window sheds light'.   Crowe - who is a part-owner of Mr Albanese's boyhood NRL team South Sydney Rabbitohs - speaks over the images as they flash up on screen.  'We can do better. All it takes is a better government with better plans,' he says. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Labor for comment.  The advert was played at Mr Albanese's official campaign launch in Perth on Sunday. The Labor leader is six points ahead of Scott Morrison in the polls and is on track on form Government - should the polls mirror the actual election results.  Mr Albanese also used his Perth speech address to officially unveil the party's new housing equity scheme. The Help to Buy scheme will provide an equity contribution of as much as 40 per cent of the purchase price of a new home and up to 30 per cent for an existing dwelling for 10,000 Australians. Coalition Housing Minister Michael Sukkar said barely anyone would take up the offer because they don't want 'Anthony Albanese sitting at their kitchen table and owning part of their home'.  Mr Albanese also pledged to build more electric vehicle charging stations with $40million funding matched by the NRMA - as well as a hydrogen refuelling network on 16 busy freight routes.  Meanwhile, Mr Morrison has pledged an extra 50,000 older Australians will get access to the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card if he is re-elected. The PM is set to announce an increase in the singles income test threshold - from $57,761 to around $90,000 - from July 1 this year to broaden access to the concession card. The couples threshold will also increase from $92,416 to $144,000.  'We can do better. All it takes is a better government with better plans.  'Too many people are working multiple jobs just to keep their heads above water. 'We can do better than that. 'Too many of our kids aren't gonna be able to buy a house. We can do better than that. 'Too many people in regional Australia can't get basic healthcare. We can do better than that. 'And our elderly are being mistreated every day in a broken aged care system. We can do so much better than that. 'We have to. Your vote is powerful. Your vote can change things. Your vote can change Australia for the better.' ",
  "4aa7294610ae9031bfd69af69e6e47ba263e01df309880a7a891b476": "One boy is dead while another has serious pelvic injuries after a horror head-on crash on a major highway.  A Nissan Patrol was travelling north along the Bruce Highway at Gregory River near Prosperine in Queensland's north when the vehicle collided with a Toyota RAV4 travelling in the opposite direction on Sunday night. A 12-year-old boy travelling in the Toyota died at the scene.  Another 12-year-old boy also travelling in the Toyota was transported to Proserpine Hospital but was later airlifted to Mackay with serious injuries.  The Central Queensland Helicopter Rescue Service described the incident as an 'absolute horrific tragedy.' 'Please send your prayers and strength to the family and friends of all those involved,' the organisation wrote online.  The female Toyota driver, 48 from Cannonvale and sole occupant in the Nissan, a 45-year-old Townsville man, were both taken to Proserpine Hospital in stable conditions. Forensic Crash Unit officers have launched an investigation into the horror crash, which closed the Bruce Highway in both directions for several hours. 'Lengthy delays expected, please avoid the area,' a Queensland Ambulance alert read. The speed limit is 100km/h along that stretch of the Bruce Highway. It was one of several incidents the rescue helicopter was dispatched to over the Labor Day long weekend in Queensland. One man was gored in the abdomen and kicked in the head by a bull at a rodeo at Bloombury near Mackay on Saturday night. He was airlifted to Mackay Base Hospital in a stable condition but in 'significant pain.'",
  "873191eaf3cffeeff1b0536f9c527094d5073b323cf676314902931a": "Dog owners across the country are being urged to secure their pets after Australia Post recorded a surge in attacks on their posties and delivery drivers.  Footage released by Australia Post shows several incidents where an unsecured dog has chased, attacked, and bitten a postal worker delivering parcels and mail to the letterbox or front door.  Australia Post issued a call for aggressive dogs to be restrained after staff suffered 1,173 incidents involving dogs since July last year - almost 400 in a single year.  Australia Post Executive General Manager Network Operations Rod Barnes said incidents involving dogs have tripled in the last five years, with a posties or delivery driver attacked five times a day.  Crazy dogs have been responsible for a number of serious injures to posties, often biting them on their arms and legs.  In one video, a large dog is seen running out the front door of a home and lunges on to the postman.   Mr Barnes said the front door poses the biggest challenge as dogs break free from their owners who are trying to restrain their pet with their leg or knee.  'These incidents can be traumatic for our team members at the front door and for the pet owner,' Mr Barnes said.   'Dogs attack our posties and delivery drivers about five times every day and that's tripled in the last five years,' Mr Barnes said.  'Our posties know how important their job is and they do their best to get the mail and parcels to your door but they need to feel safe and we need dog owners help to achieve that. 'If our posties don't feel safe at the letter box or the front door they may not be able to deliver.'  Another video shows a large Rottweiler guarding the letter box by jumping on the fence and barking.  Queensland, NSW and Western Australia have seen the most dog incidents and while attacks do happen at front doors, letter boxes and in front yards, around half take place on footpaths and on the road.   The footage, compiled of different videos, shows a number of big dogs chasing and attacking the postal workers motorbike.  'Even if a dog doesn't bite it can cause a serious accident by running in front of a postie or driver in an electric delivery vehicle, and that can also result in an injury to your pet,' Mr Barnes said. 'We're really asking that people remember to shut their gates, keep their pets secured and help make sure our people can deliver their parcels and mail to them safely.'  Australia Post has launched the awareness campaign, 'Even good dogs have bad days' calling on owners to help keep posties safe.  Experienced postie Tony Gadsby was the victim of yet another dog bite while covering a new route.  Mr Gadsby, who has spent more than 20 years delivering mail and parcels, said he did not have time to react when the dog raced towards him.  'I was quite anxious for a minute but I managed to calm myself down,' Mr Gadsby said. 'I'm a little bit more weary and that's hard for me because I love dogs but you have to treat them all as a potential danger.  'It's common for people to say 'it never bites' but as a dog owner myself I know they can be unpredictable, and I'd urge fellow owners to just take that extra moment to make sure their dog is not going to be a danger to someone just doing their job.'  Australian veterinarian, Doctor Katrina Warren, said dogs could be fearful of unfamiliar visitors or consider posties trespassers on their territory and engage in behaviour that would be dangerous. 'The problem is the postie always comes back, so your dog will bark at them again to make them go away but after a while your dog may up the ante and bark more, growl, lunge or even bite to ensure your postie really gets the picture,' Dr Warren said. 'If a dog is given the chance to keep rehearsing this behaviour, it will become a habit that can be difficult to break and dangerous to visitors including posties.' Australia Post advised customers who are unable to secure their dogs can nominate for items to be left at a place that's safe for both the parcel and our posties or to choose a free 24/7 parcel locker to collect parcels away from home.  Prevent the opportunity    Place your dog somewhere where they can't see or interact with the postie. Do not allow them to run free in a yard or passage where they have access to people entering your property or can bark at people through a gate or fence. Leash Your Dog Do not allow your dog to run out your door when someone comes to the door. Have a leash and some treats by the door, and put your dog on the leash when someone comes. Ask your dog to sit and give them a treat for nice behaviour before walking out together. Make Positive Associations Teach your dog that when the postie visits your property something positive will happen, such receiving lots of treats from you for calm behaviour. You can start training as soon as you bring a puppy home. Seek professional advice   If your dog has already bitten someone, or is showing warning signals such as snarling and growling, you should seek professional help from a veterinary behaviourist as soon as possible",
  "aee3c81f8f5e136db3012ff7d8c0d092918ce6c9435344b8530cc14d": "Annastacia Palaszczuk has attacked Scott Morrison for 'dividing' Australia as she made her first appearance alongside Anthony Albanese during the election campaign.  The Queensland Labor Premier appeared with Mr Albanese to attend a union march through Brisbane on Monday morning, a day after he spoke alongside another Labor leader, Mark McGowan, in Perth. In a press conference before the march, Ms Palaszczuk accused Scott Morrison of 'attacking' Labor premiers during the pandemic.  'The Prime Minister of this country had a golden opportunity to unite this country and during a pandemic, he chose to divide,' she said.  'He chose to attack Queensland, attack Victoria, and attack WA.'  Her comments came during the first time Ms Palaszczuk has campaigned with Mr Albanese at this election, after she took a three-week break over Easter.  At the height of the pandemic, Morrison Government ministers were critical of Queensland's hard border stance which left families split apart.  One 26-year-old nurse from Canberra was refused to say goodbye to her dying father in Brisbane under Ms Palaszczuk's rules. However, contrary to Ms Palaszczuk's claims that Mr Morrison attacked the premiers, the PM's government funded their lockdowns and even backed Mr McGowan's extension of the WA hard border earlier this year.  In fact, conservatives accused him of being pliant and allowing the premiers to effectively run the country by not challenging their border shutdowns or vaccine mandates. Throwing her support behind the Opposition leader on Monday, Ms Palaszczuk said: 'This country needs someone who will unite this country and I believe that Anthony Albanese is definitely the person to do this job.'  'We have got someone here who will stand side-by-side Queenslanders, we have got someone who will stand by us to make sure that we get the infrastructure we need.' She blasted Mr Morrison for not funding quarantine camps in Queensland as soon as she asked for them and said Mr Albanese would be more amenable to her demands.  'He would not have delayed things like quarantine. He would have stepped up to the plate,' she said. 'In relation to Scott Morrison, enough is enough. Now is the time, now is the time for us to unite the country and the man to do this is Anthony Albanese.' The Labor leader spruiked his relationship with Ms Palaszczuk after they worked together as infrastructure ministers 10 years ago and also talked up his plan to lift wages. 'The simple principle that we celebrate today is a fair day's pay for a fair day's work,' he said.    The Labor leader is six points ahead of Scott Morrison in the polls and is on track on form Government - should the polls mirror the actual election results.  Mr Albanese also used his Perth speech address to officially unveil the party's new housing equity scheme. The Help to Buy scheme will provide an equity contribution of as much as 40 per cent of the purchase price of a new home and up to 30 per cent for an existing dwelling for 10,000 Australians.

  "77f172a5f55a3076b749d0ba93de776ef0dfc60c5ada5ffdc7c8fdeb": "A builder who's been on the tools for more than 25 years has been forced to close his business for good due to crippling costs and supply issues that he says have just about broken him. Anthony Lococo, from Torquay, Victoria, will be shutting his building company Lococo Build later this year in what is the latest in a long line of tradesman feeling the pressure because of skyrocketing material prices. He explained that supply shortages, price increases and even finding tradesmen to do the work were all factors that had left him with no choice but to give up his business - and go to university to retrain as a teacher. It comes after several high-profile building companies shut up shop in recent months, with Queensland construction giant Condev collapsing alongside Melbourne-based builder Probuild. 'It's been a heartbreaking decision to make, but after two years of struggling to get materials and trades, and costs continuingly blowing out and eating into anything that even looked like a profit margin,' Mr Lococo explained. 'I decided at Christmas that I just couldn't face another year of it. I'm drained, and I've had enough. 'Reports from the trade industry said that it was going to be just as bad if not worse this year, and we just couldn't do it. I have a family, and I was feeling the pressure.' Costs of metal ores, plastics, and timber have been consistently rising for years, but particularly through the pandemic as factories were forced to shut down for extended periods. The trickle-down effect of these surging costs means Australian tradies are forced to cover the difference because they had entered fixed-price contracts with clients. 'There's a lot of builders who are struggling out there, I know a few of them. Many don't want to talk about it but they're feeling the pressure,' he added. A survey conducted last year by Master Builders Australia revealed that 98 per cent of builders in Victoria had been affected by price rises and wait times for materials. Mr Lococo says rising material costs were possibly the most significant problem that required urgent addressing, revealing that his expenses had jumped as much as 30 per cent in the space of a month. He had built the company with his wife 'from the ground up'. 'I got to the point where I couldn't even face the thought of going into the office,' he explained.   'Having to let my team go is devastating, but I don't realistically have any choice. 'You just can't run a successful business like this, you're just belting your head against a brick wall.'  Mr Lococo has committed to finalising all his current projects but admits picking an end date for his business will be a challenge. Despite his decision to walk away from his business, Mr Lococo is keen to stay involved with the building sector, and plans to take up a course at university to become a teacher to young tradies. Michaela Lihou from the Masters Builders Association of Victoria, elaborated on the 'crisis' impacting tradesmen in Australia. 'We have got supply shortages, skills shortages and at the moment, it's a perfect storm,' she said. Matthew Mackey, executive director of engineering company Arcadis, said smaller businesses are more likely to go broke because they can't absorb the cost increases like their larger counterparts. 'Smaller businesses don't have the cash flow, they don't have the same safety net,' he explained. 'They're going to feel the pain a lot sooner and a lot more harshly.' Mr Mackey said contractors were feeling the pinch after locking themselves into agreements months before the cost of materials rose, so they had to bear the weight of the difference and make only razor-thin profits if not total losses.  'Some people are blaming the pandemic, some are blaming material cost increases, but there's a bigger issue, and it'll affect just as much as the bigger companies as the smaller businesses,' Mr Mackey said.  Rising costs are also believed to have fueled the collapse of major construction firm ProBuild, as the company owed $14million to workers for its doomed 443 Queen Street project in Brisbane. The chief executive of South African parent company Wilson Bayly Holmes-Ovcon that owns Probuild said there had been 'red flags' years ago. In March, it was revealed ProBuild owed 786 employees across 19 projects $14 million, and even more to its 2,300 creditors.  WBHO told the Johannesburg Stock Exchange it could no longer profitably build apartment complexes.  As a result, administrators were assigned to Probuild after the parent company refused to throw any more money at the failed construction firm. The bombshell decision will jeopardise 18 building and civil engineering projects around Australia and the livelihoods of nearly 800 workers. The group's project in Brisbane for a 264 high-quality residential apartments has hemorrhaged as much as $223million in material losses.",
  "ceef92b5895fac72d5470d010d33a66a8505b7fa1f946aaa5bcc9ff8": "A family from Tennessee was shocked to discover their 17-year-old daughter's movements were being tracked around Walt Disney World in Florida by an Apple AirTag for around four hours. Jennifer Gaston and her daughter Madison became frantic when the teen received a notification on her iPhone saying they were being tracked as they headed back to their car on the Magic Kingdom's monorail in Florida earlier this week.   The notification showed that Madison had been tracked over the course of four hours, from 7.09pm to 11.33pm. The tracker had located everywhere she had visited in the sprawling theme park and all the way to the parking lot. 'We were terrified, we were confused, hurt and scared,' Jennifer told Fox 35 Orlando. 'She [Madison] literally watched it follow us from the tram all the way back to our vehicle.' 'It showed the first destination where it was detected with her, then it basically draws a line and makes the connections of the points where she had been,' she added.   The teen and her mother searched their car but couldn't find the device. They locked the car's door and drove away before calling the police, with Madison continuing to monitor the device's location on her iPhone. 'As she was refreshing it, it showed the AirTag was still in our parking spot so somehow when we were frantically shaking out clothes and dumping everything out of our bags it fell out,' Jennifer said.  The $30 wireless devices were designed to help keep track of items people often misplace, like keys or wallets, but have been revealed to have been used by stalkers to track people. The device is designed to prohibit 'unwarranted tracking' by alerting a nearby iPhone when an AirTag has been separated from its user. For example, if someone was to place an AirTag on a car but not get in the car, then the driver of the vehicle should be alerted that there is an AirTag nearby or moving with them.  The Apple AirTags are designed to emit a sound after they are separated from their owner.  Madison received a ping on her iPhone as she was leaving the park to notify her that she was carrying an unknown AirTa from 9:30 pm to 11:33 pm   She checked her clothing and dumped everything out of her bags but did not find the device. After she and her mom left the park, the AirTag was still pinging that it was in the parking lot.  'I had seen videos of other people warning people about them and what they were basically. So that's how I knew what they were and I did not ignore the notification,' Madison added. The AirTag should begin to play a sound to let people nearby know its location. However, users have reported that the alert and sound can take hours or even days to be sent out and are even able to be turned off.  The devices are also very small and can easily be hidden.  The location of the AirTag is sent to iCloud - where it can be seen on a map, according to Apple's website. Using the 'Find My' app, the system provides its owner with step-by-step directions to locate the tag and the missing product.  Madison and her mother agreed that people should report the slightest unusual digital activity they notice on their phones, and to learn more about new tracking technology as time goes on. 'Definitely do your research and find out what these are. Have proper settings on your phone so that if you do have an Air Tag that ends up with you to make sure that your phone will detect it,' Garson said.  The Orange County Sheriff's Office in Florida said since the family didn't end up physically finding the AirTag, the incident has not been identified as a crime. However, investigators have filed an incident report and have been made aware of the event.      Apple has released an Android-friendly app called tracker detect to allow Android users to be alerted of an AirTag moving with them. Due to growing concerns on the device's misuse, some privacy groups have called for the gadgets to be stripped from store shelves. 'Some people who have ill will towards others are using it to potentially stalk people, follow people, tag vehicles, high luxury vehicles, that they might want to come back and steal,' said David Benson, a security consultant in the area. 'Even if it's not at epidemic proportions, it's happening enough where it's concerning.' If a person find themselves being tracked after finding an AirTag, then the best outcome is to go to a public location and to inform local authorities rather than to go home or to a hotel, Benson added. In January, a young mother in Texas said she found an AirTag taped inside her duffel bag as she traveled from Texas to Maine. 'I think they definitely would have hurt me. I don't think you do that for no reason,' she told Inside Edition at the time. 'It took almost 14 hours to let me know this was happening,' she said.  Hundreds of other women have posted videos on TikTok to share their stories of how they found mysterious AirTags attached to their items and tracking their location since the tracking device was released by Apple in April. Each AirTag has a serial number physically written on it and connected by Bluetooth. If law-enforcement produces a court order, Apple could reveal the identity of the iPhone the AirTag is registered to. Law enforcement officers are advising women to go to the police department immediately after getting an unwarranted AirTag notification or finding the device. If possible they advise to avoid returning home, however most women seem to learn about the tracking devices after going home.",
  "f27dbb9411084402bc6cf3a3ca3f19f3808683d9947cfade83925d22": "An outspoken activist who held up a sign which read 'f*** Xi Jinping' at a busy Asian market could be charged over the brazen stunt.  Drew Pavlou, 20, confronted an angry mob with the obscene message to the Chinese President at Eastwood Plaza in Sydney's north-west on Saturday.  Mr Pavlou quickly provoked a furious reaction at the crowded shopping centre as dozens of locals made their disapproval of the stunt known. The activist took to Twitter on Sunday to tell his followers he had been contacted by NSW Police, who said they intended to press charges.  'New South Wales police just called me to tell me I'm getting charged for holding a sign saying 'Fuck Xi Jinping' in Sydney,' he tweeted on Sunday afternoon.  'They won't tell me what the exact charge is and they won't tell me whether the men who physically assaulted us are being charged.' Several of his followers expressed their shock at the threat of formal charges, which Mr Pavlou described on Instagram as 'so unfair'. 'Simple intimidation tactics. There is no law against foul language and there is no law against insults,' one user replied.  'Unfortunately the police will treat your situation as inciting public unrest, which it was,' another commented.   Mr Pavlou said if he had to 'potentially get bashed and charged for holding a protest' for talking about the Chinese President 'so be it'.  A NSW Police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia officers were investigating an alleged assault that occurred during political protest activity at Eastwood Plaza.  There were no reports of any serious injuries and no charges have been laid.   In footage of the tense showdown the activist and a friend were circled by shoppers who screamed abuse, forcing officers to protect the pair.  At one stage one local grappled with Mr Pavlou's sidekick, who was filming the stunt, with the stand-off caught on camera by another bystander. Eastwood has one of the highest Chinese populations in Sydney, and Mr Pavlou's provocative action caused an incendiary reaction.  It only took seconds for many stunned shoppers and stallholders to vent their fury at him over the sign.  Mr Pavlou posted footage of the clash on Facebook showing him surrounded by angry stallholders at the Asian market, yelling abuse at him. 'F*** you, motherf***er,' one screamed at him repeatedly. 'It's free speech!' Another punches the sign and tells him: 'America has genocide, not Xi Jinping.' And several women call the man a coward and tell him to 'f*** off' as he stands in the street with his hands behind his back in the face of the abuse.  He tells the crowd he's not a coward and has not threatened anyone, and invites them to hit him while his hands are behind his back.  Police eventually restored calm after they intervened to keep the sides apart.  'My point is a simple one - I should be able to insult a dictator like Xi Jinping in my own country without being physically assaulted and attacked,' Mr Pavlou posted on Facebook. 'Australia is a democracy and we should be free to insult any leader no matter how coarsely - this is a simple principle of free speech.  'No way would I have been surrounded by 50 people and physically assaulted if I held up a sign saying 'F*** Scott Morrison' in Sydney.  'Why should Chinese ultra-nationalists get a free pass to assault people in Australia if someone insults Xi Jinping?' Mr Pavlou was widely lauded by his followers on social media, who acknowledged his public conduct was dangerous, but felt it sent a strong message. 'Stay safe, Drew! This is typical barbaric behaviour by Chinese Communist Party supporters. Hope they all get deported so they can enjoy their 'freedom' under Xi's rule,' one said. Another stated 'that's why people can't and don't like CCP supporters. How can we allow dictatorship to spread their voice in our country?  'I bet those Chinese people won't dare to do the same thing abusing their politicians in Beijing. Double standard of some Chinese people.' Brisbane-based Mr Pavlou was in Sydney to support Kyinzom Dhongdue, the Tibetan-heritage Democratic Alliance candidate for the seat of Bennelong. In July 2019, at the height of the Hong Kong protests, Mr Pavlou organised a protest at the University of Queensland in support of the Hong Kong democracy movement. He was later suspended by the university who accused him of 11 cases of misconduct - but was able to return and continue his politics degree this year. In December 2021, he launched the Drew Pavlou Democratic Alliance (DPDA) federal political party, pledging to fight corruption, protect human rights, tackle poverty and homelessness and build a green economy.",
  "af8d6efa228560b77c3db27dfdb0c5e71f07aa3ba9b92213ca69f231": "Back in November 2003, Michael Peterson was only a month into a life sentence for murdering his wife when he received a strange but cheering letter in prison. Its sender, a Frenchwoman living in Paris, insisted that she knew the best-selling American novelist better than anyone, outside his family -- so much so that she was convinced Peterson was innocent. But Sophie Brunet wasn't one of those weird obsessives who wrote fan mail to convicted serial killers -- instead, she was the editor of an acclaimed documentary series, The Staircase, about Peterson's intriguing case. Peterson had given her and her team extraordinary access as he sought to prove his innocence. And, at least on her, the strategy had clearly worked. Brunet, who watched some 600 hours of footage relating to Peterson's case, wrote: 'I saw you, I know you're innocent, it was a great injustice.' She added that the way he'd talked about his wife had moved her. She asked if she could send Peterson books, and started with France's great novelist Marcel Proust. Soon they were regularly exchanging letters about books and painting and, a year later, she visited him in prison. They'd speak on the phone every day. When Peterson was released eight years into his sentence to await retrial, he and Brunet became lovers. Every two or three months, she would fly from France to stay at his house in Durham, North Carolina. Peterson even considered moving to Paris and starting a new life with her. The couple ended their relationship only in 2017, after he visited France. 'I realised, no, I can't live in Paris -- I don't speak French, I'm too old, I can't afford to live in Paris and my children and grandchildren were in America,' he told his local newspaper. 'We spent three days together and went to Normandy and she said: 'If you can't commit to love with me all the time, let's end it.' It was a blow to both of us for which I feel not guilt but sorrow. I couldn't give her what she needed and deserved.' Their bizarre romance, not to mention the gruesome and unexplained death of businesswoman Kathleen Peterson that preceded it and became an international sensation, is the subject of a forthcoming HBO drama, The Staircase. The eight-part series stars Colin Firth as Michael, Toni Collette as Kathleen and Juliette Binoche as Sophie Brunet. Mrs Peterson's life ended at the bottom of a blood-spattered staircase one night in December 2001. How she got there has provided the army of amateur detectives fascinated by unresolved 'true-crime' cases with one of their most abiding conundrums. It is a riddle subsequent events -- notably her husband's early release after admitting manslaughter while still asserting his innocence -- have done nothing to clear up. Conflicting theories range from the mundane: she tripped after too much wine; to the lurid: she was bludgeoned to death after discovering Peterson was bisexual; and the outlandish: she was attacked by an owl. There was a further chilling question: had the former U.S. Marines captain and Vietnam veteran done it before? Was he responsible for a shockingly similar death in Germany 18 years earlier? In an unusual approach, the makers of The Staircase will include the various alternative scenarios as to how she died. The case was first chronicled in 2004 in the 13-part documentary series, also called The Staircase, on which Sophie Brunet worked. First shown in the UK on BBC4 as Death On The Staircase and later becoming a hit when made available on Netflix, the series benefited not only from the fact Peterson's trial was televised but also from his decision to co-operate, giving cameras access to him, his family and his legal team. However, even after additional episodes were added in 2013 to update the story, the documentary never mentioned that the woman editing it was having an affair with its subject. That rather significant omission has fuelled accusations that the documentary was far too sympathetic to Peterson, portraying him -- rather than his wife -- as the victim and underplaying or even ignoring the evidence against him. Peterson later admitted that the TV series 'was a very powerful instrument in my conviction being overturned' but insisted Brunet didn't let her relationship with him taint her 'professional' impartiality. Many don't believe that, and Kathleen's family -- convinced he killed her -- dismissed the documentary as his 'ultimate vanity project'. The police, however, were suspicious of Peterson from the start. He had dialled 911 just after 2.40am one night in December 2001, gasping and sobbing as he falteringly told an emergency operator: 'She fell down some stairs. She's still breathing, please come!' The emergency services found 48-year-old Mrs Peterson, a telecoms company executive, lying in a pool of blood at the foot of the back staircase at their mansion. The walls around her body were heavily spattered with blood and she had horrific head injuries as well as others around her body. To investigators, it hardly looked like she'd just fallen down stairs. An autopsy revealed Kathleen had sustained seven deep lacerations on her skull, among 38 injuries over her face, back, head, hands, arms and wrists. Prosecutors charged Peterson, then 58, with first-degree murder. They said he'd bludgeoned his wife to death with a fire iron after she discovered details of his gay sex life. Erudite and eccentric, but also brash and egotistical, Peterson was indignant that he should be accused, co-operating fully when the French documentary-makers came calling. Helpfully for him, the director, Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, had won an Oscar in 2001 for a documentary about a 15-year-old wrongly accused of murder. According to Peterson, on the night of Kathleen's death, they had drunk wine and champagne to celebrate a possible film deal for one of his books and watched a film, America's Sweethearts. It was little secret within their family that the Petersons were a boozy pair. He stayed outside by their swimming pool when she -- wearing flip-flops and feeling woozy after taking Valium on top of the alcohol -- stumbled on the fourth step of a narrow, poorly lit wooden staircase, falling backwards and hitting her head on a door frame. To explain her extensive injuries, Peterson and his lawyers suggested she then slipped in her own blood and hit her head again, losing consciousness and bleeding to death. At his trial, which started in North Carolina in 2003, the prosecution kept returning to those injuries, asking jurors if they could have been the result of slipping down a few stairs. Paramedics who'd attended her testified the blood had been mostly dry and prosecutors alleged Peterson had killed his wife hours before sounding the alarm and spent the intervening time cleaning up. A crime scene analyst described Peterson's behaviour -- hugging his dead wife and sobbing uncontrollably -- as melodramatic. Prosecutors suggested the murder weapon had been a 'blow poke': a hollow fireplace poker that can be blown through to rekindle a fire. The one in the Peterson household was missing. Experts clashed over the abundant blood spattering and whether Peterson would have had space to wield the 3 ft blow poke in a confined area. The defence's spatter expert drank some ketchup and theatrically spat it out to show how Kathleen might have coughed blood on the walls. And what about motive? After analysing Peterson's computer, the prosecution alleged that, the night she died, Kathleen had found 2,000 images of gay sex stored on it. The computer also contained explicit email conversations he'd had with a male prostitute and serving soldier, Brent Wolgamott. 'I'm very bi and that's all there is to it,' Peterson had written. He told Mr Wolgamott he'd never used an escort before, although he had once paid a 'super-macho guy who played lacrosse' for sex. The prosecution argued that Peterson's secret bisexuality had been the 'trigger' for the murder after his wife (they alleged) confronted him. Witnesses attested that he had a vicious temper. Peterson insisted Kathleen had been aware of his sexuality. Prosecutors did their best to play up his sexual preferences with a Bible Belt jury, portraying Peterson as the debauched writer sitting at home looking at 'filth' on his computer while his wife earned their crust. Prosecutors also cited an additional motive: money. The Petersons lived in a grand house and seemed successful but they were $143,000 in debt. Kathleen was the main breadwinner and her accidental death would have been worth $1.4 million to Peterson from a life insurance policy, the court heard. If the prosecution case wasn't totally compelling, it had other evidence to throw at Peterson from a different source. It concerned Elizabeth Ratliff, an American military widow who'd been a close friend of Peterson and his first wife Patty while they were living near Frankfurt in West Germany. Eighteen years earlier in 1985, Elizabeth too had been found dead -- lying in a pool of blood at the foot of a staircase. She had severe head injuries and, again, the surrounding walls were spattered with blood. Peterson had been the last known person to have seen her alive, having helped put her children to bed after he and Patty had dined there the previous night. The verdict had been that she'd died from a brain haemorrhage unrelated to the fall, but the U.S. court trying Peterson ordered her remains to be exhumed from her Texas grave for a second autopsy. This time, to the delight of loved ones who suspected foul play, a coroner listed her cause of death as 'homicide'. Peterson -- who had adopted Elizabeth's daughters -- wasn't formally accused of killing her but prosecutors argued that even if he hadn't done it, the circumstances had given him a 'blueprint' of how to get rid of his wife. Nevertheless, his motive for allegedly killing Elizabeth wasn't clear. At his trial for murdering Kathleen, Peterson's lawyers were eventually able to produce the missing blow poke. Investigators had supposedly overlooked it in the Peterson garage and, when analysed, it bore no signs of having been used to bludgeon anyone. The four-month trial ended in a guilty verdict and a life sentence without parole. The case had already torn apart Peterson's extended family -- both he and Kathleen had grown-up children from previous marriages when they wed in 1997 -- with some supporting him and others not. Caitlin, Kathleen's daughter by another man, filed a civil 'wrongful death' claim against Peterson even before he went on trial. Caitlin eventually won $25 million although her stepfather admitted no liability and had by then filed for bankruptcy. Caitlin, as well as her late mother's two sisters, turned against Peterson after seeing graphic photos of Kathleen's body during the autopsy. They argued that Kathleen would never have put up with Peterson cheating on her, with men or women, after infidelity had ruined her first marriage. Peterson -- whose lawyers had claimed he'd had an 'idyllic' marriage to Kathleen -- admitted cheating on first wife Patty with both men and women. However, he insisted his gay affairs during his second marriage hadn't been proper relationships that undermined his love for Kathleen. It was Lawrence Pollard, a lawyer and neighbour, who in 2009 made the outlandish suggestion that an owl might have attacked Kathleen after reading that a microscopic owl feather was mentioned on the trial's evidence list. The feather was entangled with some of Kathleen's hair found clutched in her left hand. Other tiny feathers were found in her hair. The coroner considered the wounds on her scalp too deep to have been made by any bird but three animal experts contradicted her. It was entirely possible, they said, for a large raptor to have become entangled in her hair and panicked. The owl theory was never explored further, as in 2010 Peterson's judge ordered a new trial after the prosecution blood spatter expert who'd testified that stains on his clothing indicated he'd bludgeoned Kathleen was found to have misled other trials. Peterson was released but remained under house arrest awaiting retrial until 2017 when he entered an 'Alford plea' -- in which he pleaded guilty while still asserting his innocence -- to the lesser charge of manslaughter. Given he'd already served eight years, longer than a manslaughter sentence, he was freed. His trial judge later conceded Peterson's bisexuality and the earlier death in Germany had been hugely prejudicial and regretted allowing jurors to learn about them. But the jurors themselves insisted it had been the terrible damage inflicted on Kathleen that convinced them she'd been murdered. Colin Firth recently said that he, along with everyone else involved in the new drama series, feels he has no answers to the mystery of Kathleen's death. Only one person may know what happened and Michael Peterson -- who self-pityingly told The Staircase that 'All are punished' -- feels he has suffered enough.",

Emergency services were called to the Patrick Avenue address, in Croydon North, about 10.15pm on Saturday to reports of an assault. Witnesses recalled hearing screams and a commotion emanating from the home, with one neighbour rushing over and performing CPR, the Herald Sun reports.  Paramedics arrived to find the woman with critical injuries and took over from the neighbour, but despite their best efforts she could not be saved and died at the scene.  The woman is yet to be identified and the exact circumstances surrounding her death are unknown.  Homicide squad detectives are investigating and a 40-year-old Croydon North man is assisting police with their enquiries.  It is understood the man and woman were in a relationship.   Neighbours said they head a woman scream, with one saying they believed the commotion was animals having a fight.  Another local said the man in custody was a 'nice normal person' and 'they were a quiet family'.  Police have taped off the scene as forensic teams carried items away from the scene.  Children's toys, including stuffed animal and balls, could be seen in the garage, with police taking a box of the items away.  Neighbour Mr Woodrow who lives nearby said he was shocked to stumble across the police presence during his morning walk.  'I got woken up last night, I got out of bed -- I actually thought it might've been a cat trying to kill a possum, there was a human element to it,' he said. Anyone with further information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or through the website.",
  "7aac7c621d36cdf1526f0863d5627fc8ffdf9d38ac690468bf34eb51": "Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been captured in what has been described as an embarrassing yet dangerous video on social media.  Mr Morrison was visiting a worksite last month and had been given permission to operate a Mitre Drop Saw. He can be seen starting up the drop saw and continuing to cut a piece of wood - without wearing proper Personal Protective Equipment.  Daily Mail Australia understands the workplace manager told Mr Morrison there was no need to wear PPE.  The video which was posted on TikTok has already received 2.9 million views. His lack of PPE and proper training to operate the machine - generated a vast array of comments as a result.   One person claimed he was 'surprised he didn't cut his finger off.' While another said 'It actually terrifies me watching him do this stuff.'   This is not the first time Scott Morrison has made an embarrassing blunder while getting on the tools. Prime Minister Scott Morrison diced with danger when he lifted the safety mask covering his eyes just as he unleashed a blinding flash from a welding torch. The PM wore a regulation welding safety visor during a visit to a workshop in Alice Springs. But he lifted the protective helmet moments before he touched the blazing arc of the welding torch to a metal beam.  His face lit up with the intense white light from the searing flame, which should only be viewed from behind the specially darkened screen.  Video showed a bystander desperately reaching out to try to bring down the mask but couldn't manage it in time as the 6000C spark erupted in his face. Seconds earlier Morrison had cheerfully assured the tradie with him 'I've done this before, up in the Hunter.' 'On the tools again!' he added.   Eye damage from burns is a huge risk in welding and precautions to prevent it are taken extremely seriously.   On social media the Prime Minister's critics jumped at the chance to pile on. 'Stupid, dangerous, and probably illegal,' said Lynne on twitter.",

People braved the showers walking on Fistral beach in Newquay, Cornwall, while umbrellas were on full display at the Central Promenade in Blackpool. Elsewhere, Wessex Morris Men celebrated May Day dawn above the head of the Cerne Abbas Giant and others gathered on Glastonbury Tor for the Gaelic festival of Beltane. Saturday morning saw a cloudy start, before heavy rain hit south-western England by the afternoon, with northern England and Scotland experiencing showers. The rain will clear in most areas by the evening, with spots of rain still for south-western England and for north-eastern Scotland.  As the night progresses, mist and fog will develop widely, and by the early hours, it will be dry for all. It will be a cloudy night, with the odd clear spell in places and light winds. Bank Holiday Monday will be mostly dry and cloudy to start, with light rain for eastern Scotland and north-eastern England. Some parts of the UK will experience sunny intervals, including the East Midlands and Western Isles of Scotland.  Rain and scattered showers will spread across the country through the afternoon, but by the evening, showers will be confined to northern and central England.  Temperatures could reach up to 64.4F (18C) on Monday, although they are not expected to return to the highs seen earlier in the month, as rain gives way to dry weather across the country.  David Oliver, Met Office deputy chief meteorologist, told The Sun: 'A good deal of dry weather is expected on Monday with most areas only seeing some isolated showers and mild temperatures, widely in the mid-teens.' According to The Mirror, forecasters have also predicted a nine-day mini-heatwave starting on May 5 as temperatures could reach 20C to coincide with the local elections. The Bank Holiday also triggered a pub rush, with 50million pints expected to be drunk in pubs over the long weekend, according to industry sales data. A source at a major UK pub company said: 'Our pubs had to get extra orders in. It's a bumper weekend thanks to one of the first Bank Holidays since Covid. Drinkers are making the most of it.' Luke Dearden, general manager of The Sydney Arms, Chelsea, west London, said: 'We've had to increase beer orders by 20 to 25 per cent this weekend. Breweries have been making sure we have enough stock. It's a big weekend.' A spokesperson from the British Beer & Pub Association said: 'The May bank holiday is providing a welcome boost to pubs, with customers enjoying their local.' This month has been the latest in the string of dry Aprils, with rainfall about 35 per cent lower than average, according to the Met Office. Predicted highs of below 68F (20C) may prove a disappointment to some after the Easter heatwave. On Good Friday, the temperature recorded at St James' Park in London was higher than in Ibiza.  'What we've seen this month is a long period of time with the UK under the influence of high pressure, bringing calm and settled weather, especially in the south,' the National Climate Information Centre's Dr Mark McCarthy said. However, this weekend's 'mixed bag of spring weather' - which Mr Miles called 'pretty standard' for late April - marks a return to normality after last year's Bank Holiday washout.",
  "2dd8b77b2b2c58790f3daaae4107034f1d994b90bc86edb8b32481be": "Former Wimbledon champion Boris Becker could work as a gym instructor in prison after he was slapped with a two-and-a-half year jail term for hiding PS2.5million of assets and loans to avoid paying his debts. Becker, 54, arrived at HMP Wandsworth on Friday, a category B prison just 2.4 miles from Centre Court where he won three tennis titles after receiving his 30-month sentence - of which he will likely serve just half - at Southwark Crown Court earlier in the day. A former governor of the prison said the disgraced tennis star would make a good gym instructor, should he be interested in taking on a working role while in jail.   Jerry Petherick told The Sun: 'Gyms are very popular in prisons - it's a job a lot of prisoners want.'  But it is unlikely that Becker will be able to step into such a role any time soon. And the tennis star could only serve 10 months - and spend the remainder of his sentence with an electronic tag - if officials decide to release him halfway through his term, The Mirror reports. New inmates taken into Wandsworth prison are forced to remain in the lockup's 'induction wing' for seven to ten days upon arrival due to ongoing Covid restrictions. Becker may then be transferred to general population, but new inmates would typically need to be in the prison for at least six weeks, showing good behaviour, before being considered for worker roles. Wandsworth is also a remand prison used to temporarily detain criminals who are later transferred to serve their sentences elsewhere, meaning the likelihood of Becker serving the entirety of his jail-term there is slim.  Fellow Wimbledon champion Andy Murray said he felt sorry for Becker, but added: 'I don't think you should get special treatment because of who you are or what you've achieved.' The ex-pro sportsman was found to have hidden PS2.5million worth of assets and loans to avoid paying his debts, and on Friday begun his sentence of which he has to serve a minimum of one year and three months. He was declared bankrupt in June 2017, owing creditors almost PS50million over an unpaid loan of more than PS3million on his estate in Mallorca, Spain.  He transferred around PS390,000 from his business account to others, including those of his ex-wife Barbara Becker and estranged wife Sharlely 'Lilly' Becker. Becker also failed to declare his share in a PS1million property in his home town of Leimen, Germany, hid a bank loan of almost PS700,000 - worth PS1.1million with interest - and concealed 75,000 shares in a tech firm, valued at PS66,000. The 54-year-old, who got a two-year suspended sentence for tax evasion and attempted tax evasion worth PS1.4million in Germany in 2002, was found guilty on April 8 of four Insolvency Act offences between June and October 2017. Each count carried a maximum sentence of seven years in prison. On Friday afternoon, Judge Deborah Taylor sentenced the six-time Grand Slam champion to 30 months' imprisonment, of which he will serve at least half. Wandsworth Prison is a Category B secure jail that can accommodate over 1,500 inmates. In a recent inspection, the institution was described as 'crumbling, overcrowded and vermin infested'. Friends and close contacts of the former tennis star have reacted with concern to him being jailed, with his biographer questioning whether he will 'survive mentally' and a German TV star saying he 'must take responsibility' for his actions.  After Becker was sentenced, Christian Schommers, who wrote a biography on the tennis legend, said he was worried about him.  The 50-year-old told the German newspaper Bild last night: 'Will he survive mentally, being in prison for a year and three months? It's really, really bad!'  Joachim Llambi, a star of German television series Just Dance, told the same newspaper: 'I find that very sad. He is a legend in Germany. But the court found that something was not as it should have been. Then he has to take responsibility for it.'  Becker remained high profile following retirement through his work as a TV pundit and as a successful coach of Djokovic for three years from December 2013. Speaking ahead of the Madrid Open to reporters in the Spanish capital, Djokovic said: 'Just heartbroken for him. He's a friend, a long-time friend, a coach for three, four years, someone I consider close in my life and has contributed a lot to my success in my career. 'I'm not going to get into details of the verdict, because I'm not in a position to do that, but, as his friend, I'm super sad for him. It's not much that you can say. 'I just hope he will go through this period that he has to be in jail and that when he comes out he's able to live his life - I don't know if we'll use the word ''normal'' because life is definitely changing for anybody going to prison, especially for that long of a time.' Andy Murray on the other hand remained more stoic on the matter, suggesting he feels no great sympathy for the three-time Wimbledon champion. In the eyes of the 34-year-old Scot, Becker has to accept responsibility for his actions. 'I didn't really feel particularly emotional about it,' said Murray when asked about his reaction to the news. 'He broke the law and if you do that, I don't think you should get special treatment because of who you are or what you've achieved. Again, I feel sorry that he's in that situation, but I also feel sorry for the people that he's affected with his decisions as well and what's happened to them. 'I hope he's OK and that he learns from his mistakes. But I didn't have a particular emotion about it.'",
  "58a1844bcaf3737c4038c8a734f0ac407f63b8f3c7ca5e67d67cfa05": "The Russians are coming. They might not be knocking down our doors, but cyber hackers are already invading our computers. And I can vouch for the disruption they are causing. My personal computer has been crippled by 'attacks from Russia,' as they have tried to hijack my email account.  It has been a harrowing experience because my computer is like an extra limb - and essential for my work.  As a victim of the Kremlin's red army of online fraudsters, I can no longer send or receive emails. Worse still, I am worried the Russians could be watching my every move - with KGB-style online eavesdropping.  Quite why I have been targeted I cannot say. Journalist I may be, but my emails are full of tips on bleeding radiators to keep heating bills down - not the codes to Britain's nuclear arsenal.  It has left me feeling not only violated, but also paranoid. At any moment, they could plunder my computer files and demand money in a blackmail 'ransomware' attack - or by stealing enough data, even empty my bank account.  The trigger for the attacks on my machine remains unknown, but may have been a result of me downloading 'Bad Rabbit' software - malware - when I pressed a button thinking I was updating software. Such malware ransacks your computer of information and appears to originate from Russia.  Then again, perhaps the Kremlin found my details on the dark web - where it appears my personal information and passwords had been leaked, following hacks into services I have used in the past.  Or maybe I had been targeted following a warning article written in The Mail on Sunday in March about 'Putin's hackers'.  Frightening though the experience has been, at least I am now aware what is going on and can take action. And according to cyber experts, I am not alone. The Russians are targeting thousands - maybe millions - of people's computers in order to disrupt Western economies following the invasion of Ukraine.  This is not just revenge for sanctions - creating disruption and panic for computer users - but to swindle us out of our money. My encounter with Russian cyber hackers began last month when the email account I use on my personal computer kept crashing.  I rang my internet service provider Easyspace. It said it had noted 'numerous' attempts to hack into my email account from a Russian internet protocol (IP) address. This resulted in it freezing my account.  After I contacted Easyspace, it lifted its 'suspension order' on my account - only for the account to crash again a couple of days later. Again, Easyspace confirmed the 'Russian state' was responsible for trying to get into my account.  The Easyspace service costs PS30 a year and did its job well. It said: 'Using a proactive email hosting company with your domain enables swift action to be taken on your behalf if there are security issues, including attempts to log in to your account in attacks from Russia.' But my Apple 'Mail' account - which enables me to read my emails - no longer opened on my computer.  Also, my ageing 12-year-old Mac was not downloading the latest security updates required to combat a surge in attacks. Cyber security expert Colin Tankard understood what I was going through. He said I should be grateful that Easyspace was up to the task and halted the Russian cyber hackers.  He said that for Easyspace to suspend my account, there must have been at least a dozen attempts to get into my emails with various passwords used. He recommended that I visit website 'Have I Been Pwned' to see if there had been any online database breaches, leaks or hacks on accounts I used.  After tapping in my email address, I found 15 instances where my personal information may have ended up on the dark web, stolen from websites such as LinkedIn, LiveAuctioneers and MySpace.  Tankard, managing director of data security firm Digital Pathways, told me to take immediate action.  He said: 'Change the Easyspace password straightaway because the attempts to log into your account show that criminals may be close to cracking the code.'  He added: 'The new password does not have to be complex - try a visually memorable, but strange phrase. An example might be something like BeesPlayBanjos56.'  Russian hackers do not need to be super sleuths to crack into an email account or steal identity information - as the keys to unlock these are easily found on the dark web.  This is where websites not listed on mainstream search engines are illegally run and used by criminals to trade in stolen information.  Crooks can pay PS10 for someone's 'fullz' - cyber slang for a person's full identity details. It includes not just a person's name, address and date of birth, but log-in details for services plus passwords.  Tankard warned that now the Russians may have my personal details, I am more likely to be reeled into a scam designed to steal my money - known as phishing.  Tankard advised: 'You need to be far more careful. Do not open unsolicited email attachments. Visit the website virustotal.com. It can tell you if any viruses have been detected on files that have been sent to you.'  The security expert then shook his head in disbelief when I showed him my external hard drive - a box used for storing data in case something goes wrong with my computer. This PS45 device was as much use as a chocolate teapot as it stopped working a couple of years ago. Only now do I see the folly of not getting it replaced. After a stern telling-off, I promised to buy a new one.  The Russians may be coming, but I am fighting back.",
  "d778942400b23aac37dfca007faac2e991bb741d3ec2fdb8b3f76114": "Movie star Angelina Jolie has been rushed to safety amid fears of an imminent rocket attack while on a visit to the western city of Lviv in Ukraine.  Jolie, 46, drew attention as a video emerged of her walking briskly with an entourage as an air raid siren went off. As the group was filmed walking away to safety, a female member turned to the camera and said 'please, no more'.  The actress herself took time to wave to the camera and insisted 'I'm okay' when asked. Jolie has worked as a special envoy for the United Nations (UN) Refugee Agency for many years, but the specifics of her trip to Ukraine are unclear. Lviv has been under attack from the Russian army in recent weeks and earlier this month, a missile attack on the city left at least seven people dead. Earlier, Ukrainian Maya Pidhorodetska posted another video of the famous actress and filmmaker on Facebook. 'Nothing special. Just Lviv. I just went to have coffee. Just Angelina Jolie,' she wrote in Ukrainian after filming the actress, who waved to her from the counter.  'Ukraine is simply supported by the whole world.' In Pidhorodetska's clip, Jolie was seen happily talking with locals in Lviv while wearing casual clothes. Fans spotted her in the Ukrainian city, greeting Jolie as Russian forces gathered in the east of the country for a renewed assault. Footage taken earlier in the day shows her singing autographs for fans and sharing conversations with several local residents. Lviv's regional governor Maksym Kozytsky said Jolie - who has been a UNHCR Special Envoy for Refugees since 2011 - had come to speak with displaced people who have found refuge in Lviv, including children undergoing treatment for injuries sustained in the missile strike on the Kramatorsk railway station in early April. The attack in the eastern Ukrainian city appeared to deliberately target a crowd of mostly women and children trying to flee a looming Russian offensive, killing at least 52 and wounding dozens more. 'She was very moved by (the children's) stories,' Kozytsky wrote. 'One girl was even able to privately tell Ms. Jolie about a dream she'd had.' He said Jolie also visited a boarding school, talk with students and took photos with them, adding 'she promised she would come again.' In February, Jolie spoke about the war in Ukraine in a post to her 12.7 million Instagram followers. She wrote: 'Like many of you, I'm praying for the people in Ukraine. 'My focus along with my @refugees colleagues is that everything possible is done to ensure the protection and basic human rights of those displaced, and refugees in the region. 'We have already seen reports of casualties and people starting to flee their homes to seek safety. 'It is too soon to know what will happen, but the significance of this moment - for the people of Ukraine, and for the international rule of law - cannot be overstated.' 'The visit was a surprise to us all,' wrote Lviv's regional governor on his Telegram channel.  'Plenty of people who saw Ms. Jolie in the Lviv region could not believe that it was really her. But since Feb. 24, Ukraine has shown the entire world that there are plenty of incredible things here.'  According to Kozytsky, Jolie also met with evacuees arriving at Lviv's central railway station, as well as with Ukrainian volunteers providing the new arrivals with medical help and counseling. During the visit to the station, Jolie met volunteers working with the displaced, who told her that each of the psychiatrists on duty spoke to about 15 people a day. Many of those in the station are children aged from two to 10, according to volunteers. 'They must be in shock... I know how trauma affects children, I know just having somebody show how much they matter, how much their voices matter, I know how healing that is for them,' she said in reply. The United Nations refugee agency says more than 12.7 million people have fled their homes in the past two months, which represents around 30 per cent of Ukraine's pre-war population.  Last month, in her role as special envoy, Jolie also visited Yemen, where millions of people have been displaced by war. But she is not the first American celebrity to land in Ukraine during the conflict. American actor Sean Penn was met with the country's president and attending government press briefings as part of a VICE documentary he is filming. When Kyiv was under assault, Penn and his team walked miles to the Polish border. The actor, 61, said both he and his film crew decided to abandon their car and pursue on foot after seeing the thousands of Ukrainian residents fleeing for safety, with queues stretching for miles.  Penn described how cars were filled with women and children, with their only possession of value being the vehicle they were travelling in. The documentary is a VICE Studios production, 'in association with VICE World News and Endeavor Content,' according to a spokesman for the media group. In a translated Facebook post, the Ukrainian government said it was grateful for Sean being there and he was lauded as being more courageous than Western leaders. Although the majority of the fighting has shifted to the east of the country, Ukrainian cities in the West such as Lviv are still under bombardment from Russian missile attacks. On Saturday, Ukrainian officials said the bodies of more than 1,000 civilians have been retrieved from areas around Kyiv, and they are working with French investigators to document alleged war crimes. Forensic tests carried out on civilian corpses dumped in mass graves show women were raped before being brutally killed, it was revealed on Monday. Dozens of autopsies have been carried out on mutilated corpses from Bucha, Irpin and Borodianka, with many showing signs of torture and multiple bullet holes in the back. One coroner north of Kyiv said it is difficult to find signs of rape and sexual abuse because the bodies 'are in such bad shape'. A United Nations mission to Bucha documented 'the unlawful killing, including by summary execution, of some 50 civilians there', the UN's Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said. In the same town, 25 women aged 14 to 25 were kept in a basement and systematically raped, with nine of the women becoming pregnant in a case now recorded by human rights commissioner Lyudmila Denisova.",

This squalid 170-year-old Victorian edifice, crammed with more than 1,300 inmates, is regularly described as one of the UK's worst jails. A report this year by Charlie Taylor, Chief Inspector of Prisons, revealed a jail blighted by drug abuse and mental health problems, where 'desperately bored' inmates spend more than 22 hours a day in dilapidated cells. One group of inmates was described as walking 'blinking into the sunlight' after more than a week indoors. Violence is an acute problem, with almost one attack every day among inmates in 2020/21. Prison staff used force 1,295 times during the same period, or nearly four times a day. This is the bleak and dehumanising environment that greeted a stunned Becker, 54, on Friday afternoon. Prison sources say the tennis star is likely to spend up to a fortnight at the Category B jail before he is moved to a lower security Category C jail. After being sentenced at Southwark Crown Court shortly before 4pm, Becker, his belongings in a Puma holdall, was led to a prison van for the 45-minute drive through South London to the prison, less than two miles from Wimbledon's Centre Court - where Becker won his first of three Wimbledon titles in 1985 aged just 17. After waiting in a reception area, the six-time Grand Slam champ is likely to have been told to strip and then searched for weapons or contraband. Becker will then have been interviewed to assess the risk of suicide or self-harm, before being led to a cell on E-Wing, where new prisoners stay during a three-day induction. If he got there by 7.30pm he may have had time for a shower. If not, he faced waiting another 24 hours. His first night at 'Wanno' - as HMP Wandsworth is known by its inmates - is likely to have been terrifying. The brutal realities of life inside the jail were exposed two years ago by ex-prisoner Chris Atkins in a book serialised by The Mail on Sunday. Mr Atkins, a Bafta-winning film-maker sentenced to five years in 2016 for a tax scam, called it 'one of the most notorious jails in the country'. 'The first thing that hits me is the noise,' he wrote about his arrival there in July 2016.  'Yelling, banging, screaming, grunting, barking, threatening, ranting, laughing, whining, arguing, fighting, howling, crying. It's as if someone has downloaded every single sound effect and is blaring them all out at once. The reception wing looks like it last had a makeover in 1895 when Oscar Wilde was here... jailed for homosexuality. 'It's basically Porridge meets One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, and is full of the most terrifying individuals I have ever seen.' Becker has been given his own cell, but he is likely to be moved to a shared one this week, a prison source said. It will be 6ft by 12ft with a concrete floor and a toilet with no seat or privacy curtain. The mattresses on the bunks are made from blue plastic so bodily fluids can be cleaned up easily. Mr Atkins said inmates 'mostly appear to be either severely mentally ill, off their heads on drugs, or both'.  He added: 'What do they do all day? Smoke spice and watch Cash In The Attic on TV.' For most, the day begins at 7.45am. Those who are employed will work, often as kitchen workers and cleaners. For the rest, most of the day is spent 'banged up' in their cells. Mr Taylor found that the prison's education block had sat unused since March 2020 and 'gym sessions were regularly cancelled'. The food is believed to be better than in other jails, with more than half of inmates saying their meals were good in a recent survey. However, overcrowding means that evening meals are simply left outside cell doors and the trolleys used to transport the food are 'filthy', according to Mr Taylor. If Becker is lucky he will be moved to H-Wing, dubbed 'The Ritz' by the white-collar inmates locked up there. Despite this, it only has six showers for 86 cells, most of which have two inmates. The tennis star may get extra perks if he becomes a listener - those trained by the Samaritans to support other inmates to reduce self-harm and suicide rates. Listeners are eligible for larger cells. However, when Mr Atkins was a listener, an inmate told him to sing a song, 'or I'll slit your throat'. He said last night that although Becker will be 'terrified' there were ways to avoid trouble. He added: 'Wandsworth is a very violent prison, but if you keep your head down and don't get involved in drugs and debt and all the politics of the wings it is not actually that dangerous. Just stay out of the way. I'd just say chin up and it's not going to be as bad as you think it's going to be. 'In prison, sport is massive for the prisoners and the officers alike. They are all going to see him as a bit of a hero. He is probably going to be inundated with people wanting his autograph.' 'Stay strong Dad... I'm on my way': The emotional cry from daughter of shamed tennis star Boris Becker as he endures first nights at rat-infested jail By Jake Ryan for Mail on Sunday The love-child daughter of shamed tennis legend Boris Becker has vowed to stand by her father and visit him in jail 'whenever I can'. Anna Ermakova, 22, who was born after Becker's liaison with a Russian model at London's Nobu restaurant, said she was in shock at her father being handed a two-and-a-half-year jail sentence for breaking Insolvency Act laws. She told German TV she hoped he would be 'strong in this difficult time', adding: 'I'm really in shock that my father has been sentenced to two years and six months. I will support him and I will visit him whenever I can. I hope that will help a bit to get through the time.' In a separate interview in which she referred to Becker's son Amadeus, Miss Ermakova said: 'I wrote a letter to the court to express my concern for my little half-brother, Amadeus. 'After all, he is only 12 and will now have to do without a father figure, whom he will lack during a difficult phase of his development. It's not fair to him. It's going to be tough for Amadeus.' Becker was sentenced at Southwark Crown Court on Friday before being taken to rat-infested Wandsworth prison, barely two miles from Centre Court at Wimbledon where the German won three men's singles titles. He is expected to be moved to a lower-security prison within a few weeks and may serve only ten months if officials decide he can be released halfway through his sentence and spend four months wearing an electronic tag. Becker, 54, who carved out a successful TV career as a pundit after quitting tennis, also faces being stripped of his honorary membership of the All England Tennis Club. Officials are understood to be angry that he wore a club tie to his sentencing appearance. His work in the future for Eurosport and the BBC is also in jeopardy. Yesterday, his second wife Lily Becker, from whom he separated in 2018, offered support. Quoting from the book of Psalms, she said: 'The Lord is your shepherd,' adding: 'I will always pray for you!' Becker's legal team argued that the father of four, who won six Grand Slam titles, had suffered enough since being declared bankrupt in June 2017, owing creditors almost PS50 million. But noting his previous conviction in Germany over a PS1.4 million tax evasion for which he received a two-year suspended sentence, Judge Deborah Taylor said: 'You did not heed the warning...and the chance you were given by the suspended sentence and that is a significant aggravating factor.' Becker was convicted of moving PS390,000 from a business account to others including those of his ex-wife and then partner and failing to declare his share in a PS1 million property in Germany or a bank loan of PS700,000 and PS66,000 of shares in a tech firm. Miss Ermakova was conceived in a broom cupboard in Nobu restaurant in Park Lane a few minutes after Becker first met her mother Angela Ermakova in 1999. Former player and fellow pundit John Lloyd, who worked as a Wimbledon commentator for the BBC with Becker, yesterday paid tribute to him as a 'great champion' and a generous colleague but said 'there will now always be an asterisk by his name'. Lloyd added: 'Whenever people talk of Boris Becker, they will follow it by saying: 'Oh, but didn't he then go to prison?' It will follow him wherever he goes. He has made a terrible mistake and now he's got to live with the consequences.'",
  "d1671846288d9fbf10d6e2996ac88b53364e7d65a089e56261668c9e": "My first hope when I heard that Neil Parish, 65, the MP for Tiverton and Honiton, had been accused of watching pornography in the Chamber of the House of Commons was that it would turn out to be an unfortunate accident. I occasionally get sent obscene images by ill-wishers (it's a common tactic with the more tenacious variety of troll), and it's not always immediately clear what's in the messages.  Perfectly plausible, then, that he might have accidentally clicked on some malicious content. Sadly, it doesn't appear as though this were the case. He stands accused by female colleagues of doing it at least twice in the chamber, and possibly also during a committee hearing. Once might be understandable; anything more is suspect. He has now admitted to being a 'f***ing idiot' and told reporters,  'I have to apologise to my wife more than anybody for putting her through all of this.' Yesterday, facing mounting pressure, he resigned as an MP. I don't care what people get up to in the privacy of their own sex lives - provided all parties are consenting adults. But the idea that anyone, male or female, should think it acceptable to sit in a place of work - let alone the House of Commons - and watch porn is beyond the pale.  It's not just the obvious fact that it demonstrates the utmost disrespect for colleagues. It's what it says about the status of porn in our society. More specifically, about how years of hardcore, explicit content available free and uncensored online has not only shaped popular culture and corrupted an entire generation, but also infected those charged with upholding standards in public life. MPs are only human. Although we expect them, rightly, to behave to a higher standard, they are not immune to lapses of judgment. But to see such a flagrant disregard towards the norms of acceptable behaviour - to think that viewing explicit images in the Commons would in any way be acceptable - that marks a new low.  It also shows us something else. That online porn, together with the culture of misogynist abuse, violence and general depravity that surrounds it, is now considered by many to be a 'normal' part of daily life. On the bus, on the Tube, in the playground, at parties: more and more people are reporting porn being viewed openly. Wherever there's an internet connection and a suitable device (basically everywhere) anyone can have free and direct access to scenes that, were they broadcast after the 9 o'clock watershed on the BBC, would cause national outrage. What is the point of having any sort of censorship at all - either in films or TV - if it's all just there at the touch of a button? If the very people who should be setting an example think it's a normal way to while away the hours during, say, a tedious Commons debate? It is perhaps worth noting that Parish has been a staunch campaigner for better rural broadband. Given everything, one now can't help wondering what his true motivation might have been. But for me it was the reaction of his wife of 40 years, Sue, who works as his secretary, which really brings home how accepted porn has become. 'If you were mad with every man who looked at pornography, you would not have many wives in the world,' she said. In other words, what's all the fuss about? Everyone does it. And she's correct of course. But that doesn't make it right. Advocates of porn like to warble on about female empowerment and sexual liberation. But if you've ever watched any of this stuff, as I unfortunately have, you will know this is nonsense. In 2015, I spent an afternoon in the company of a very nice man called Peter Johnson, the then chief executive of the Authority for Television On Demand (ATVOD). Now defunct, ATVOD was set up by Ofcom in 2010 to monitor the editorial content of services available on-demand on the internet, from BBC iPlayer to Netflix. Its job was also to monitor popular porn websites such as PornHub. Having never viewed porn, I was totally unprepared for the level of depravity that Johnson showed me. Angry men, pumped up on steroids, thrusting, slapping; girls choking and vomiting in shock and pain, tears running down their cheeks, their eyes bulging, their skin red and raw. In one video I witnessed just under an hour of total subjugation of a woman by five men. By the end of it, she was barely conscious and had to have her head held up by her hair for the parting shot. This video alone had clocked up half a million viewers, 86 per cent of whom had clicked 'like'. Those images are forever seared on my brain. Back then, the NSPCC estimated that, as a direct influence of online porn, two in five girls aged between 13 and 17 had suffered sexual coercion of some sort. In an analysis of data from a single month back in December 2013, 44,000 primary school children in Britain, aged between six and 11, were found to have visited an adult website. In the six to 15 age group, the figure was 200,000; among 16 to 17-year-olds, 473,000. And that was almost 10 years ago. Since then, the situation has become much worse. Latest figures estimate that, by the age of 11, a child who has not viewed online porn is the exception rather than the norm. For many, hardcore porn is their first - and likely formative - experience of sex. Years and years of streaming this stuff into our devices has desensitised us to the reality of porn, changed our attitudes towards sex itself and even the way we see our own bodies and - as we see time and again in cases of violence against women - legitimised the darker aspects of the human psyche. Men such as Wayne Couzens, who murdered Sarah Everard, are openly influenced by hardcore porn, and by the way women are portrayed as willing participants in depraved male fantasies of violence and abuse. All of this would be bad enough on its own; but what makes it a true tragedy for humanity is that we, as a society, have so far done nothing - absolutely nothing - to shield our children and the vulnerable. No barriers, no censorship, nothing. Given a smartphone and an internet connection, it is as easy for a child to watch some poor girl being gang raped as it is to watch Tom Hardy reading a bedtime story on CBeebies. That, I'm afraid, is the truth. And to my mind it is absolutely shameful. That successive Parliaments have kicked this issue repeatedly into the long grass - claiming that it's impossible to police the internet, that there is no international jurisdiction and coming up with every lily-livered excuse under the sun - is, quite honestly, pathetic. The best they seem to be able to muster is requiring porn sites to carry out age-verification checks. But we all know how easy it is to get around those sorts of things (practically every 14-year-old I know has a fake ID). The only sure-fire way of stopping the rot is to make it illegal to view or disseminate the stuff in public, and also to block it by default so that the only way you can access porn is by paying for it. In other words, put porn behind a paywall. I know some people will say this is censorship. Others still will say that the damage is already done. I disagree. I don't see why the rights of adults to indulge their sexual fantasies should trump the rights of young people to a childhood. And while we may have lost a generation (or two) to porn, there's no reason we shouldn't try to protect the next. Where there's a will, there is always a way. It's just that there's been no will. And now, with an MP openly watching it on the green benches, we finally see why.",
  "ccb7990e7bc5991fb1ea754eb71b2bad53c3a6f8a121e949077b3f6e": "A mother whose body was found at a Lancashire beauty spot a week after she went missing died as a result 'head injuries', police have confirmed.  In a statement Lancashire Police confirmed today a body found in the Forest of Bowland on Friday night was that of Katie Kenyon. The 33-year-old had not been seen since getting in a silver Ford Transit van in Burnley on Friday, April 22, which was then driven 17 miles into the Ribble Valley. Her ex-boyfriend, Andrew Burfield, was charged with her murder last week while police carried out extensive searches for in the Forest of Bowland and Gisburn Forest. Police announced yesterday that they found a body in the Forest of Bowland on Friday night, April 27, which they believed to be that of the mother-of-two.  Now Lancashire Police has confirmed it is her and a post-mortem has determined she died from 'head injuries'. 'We can now sadly confirm that the body found in the Forest of Bowland is that of Katie Kenyon,' it said.  'Police found Katie on Friday following extensive searches and she has now been formally identified as the missing Padiham mum, 33. 'Our thoughts remain with Katie's family and loved ones at this difficult time. The family continues to be supported by specially trained officers. 'A Home Office post-mortem examination was conducted yesterday and the cause of death was given as head injuries. 'We would like to thank, once again, all those who helped during the search for Katie. 'Andrew Burfield, 50, of Todmorden Road in Burnley has appeared in court charged with Katie's murder and will be face trial in November.'   Burfield appeared in court on Friday charged with her murder. The 50-year-old appeared at Preston Crown Court by videolink from HMP Preston, speaking only to confirm his identity. He was remanded into custody ahead of a crown court trial in November. Judge Medland QC set a date for Burfield to return to court on August 22 for a plea and trial preparation hearing, Lancashire Live reports. Police spent a week desperately looking for the mother-of-one, with officers focusing their efforts on the Forest of Bowland and Gisburn Forest. Police set up forensic tents in multiple areas in an effort to trace her after she disappeared last week. Typically the structures can be used to protect forensic evidence, but may also be staked out to provide cover for equipment.   More than 60 specialist search officers from four police forces have been scouring land looking for her. The hunt involved police and fire service officers, dog teams, mounted police, mountain rescue volunteers and drones. Scores of officers have been seen scouring the 3,000-acre Gisburn Forest, some 23 miles from Todmorden Road in Ms Kenyon's hometown. Ms Kenyon was seen getting into a silver Ford Transit van which left Burnley towards the Bolton-by-Bowland area at around 9.30am. On Friday they were seen searching an area of Gisburn Forest, but later directed their attentions back to the Forest of Bowland after receiving information about her location.   After the body was found on Friday, Detective Superintendent Gary Brooks, head of Lancashire Police's major investigation unit, said on Saturday: 'Following extensive police inquiries and after a number of days of searching, I can now sadly confirm that we have found a body and at this time we believe it to be that of Katie Kenyon. 'Katie's family have been told and my heart goes out to them at this time. We have specially trained officers supporting them at this difficult time. 'I would like to thank the public and the media for all the help they have given us during what has been a protracted, complex and very emotive search, and I would also like to thank both the partner agencies and all of the police officers and staff who have been involved in the search for Katie. 'While this is not the conclusion to those searches any of us would have wished for, I know the family appreciate those efforts.  'Once again, my thoughts today are with Katie's family and all of her loved ones.' A JustGiving page in her memory has so far raised PS13,450. A message from the family read: 'On Friday April 22, our heartbreaking nightmare began when our Katie was taken away from her children and family far too soon. 'We as family are putting together this JustGiving page for Katie to have the best send-off that Katie deserves & for Katie's son and daughter & their future to fulfil Katie's dreams she had planned with her children. 'As we know you all want to help, this would be the most appreciated way. Any donations will be truly, gratefully received. Thank you for all your kind words and support. We know you're all behind us.'",
  "ca77dbd769277871e7d945582575cd18d189e50d18fe36c124e63293": "Vladimir Putin's top military commander has been flown out of the war zone with shrapnel wounds after being to sent to Ukraine by the Russian president to secure victory, a former Russian internal affairs minister has claimed. Valery Gerasimov, the chief of staff of the Russian army, was today wounded in Izyum in Ukraine's Kharviv region, which has been at the centre of intense fighting since Russia's invasion. Putin had sent Gerasimov to the region to take personal control of his push to grab territory in eastern Ukraine, after the Russian army abandoned its plans to take Kyiv at the end of March in favour of a concentrated assault on the Donbas region of Donetsk and Luhansk. An unofficial Russian source reported that Gerasimov sustained 'a shrapnel wound in the upper third of the right leg without a bone fracture. 'The shard was removed - there is no danger to life,' he said. But Gerasimov's injury was severe enough to have him flown away from the frontlines and back to Russia to undergo further treatment, marking another embarrassing defeat for Putin's forces. The chief of staff's injury came just one day after Russian Major General Andrei Simonov, 55, was killed in Kharkiv, according to an adviser to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky.  He is Russia's ninth general to have been killed since the start of the invasion. Ukrainian interior ministry adviser Anton Gerashchenko said the attack on Izyum was 'the very place where...Gerasimov, who personally came to lead the attack on Slavyansk, was located'. A 'large number' of senior officers were killed in the attack which wounded Gerasimov, Gerashchenko said. Pro-Ukrainian Telegram channel Vertikal also alleged Gerasimov had been 'wounded near Izyum', citing unspecified sources. 'Our source reports that his legs and hips are damaged,' Vertikal said. It suggested that three of Gerasimov's entourage had been killed before he was evacuated. Russia is believed to have sustained heavy casualties in the eastern Donbas region and around cities Kharkiv and Izyum, as Ukraine's armed forces continue their bitter defence of the Donetsk and Luhansk territories which have been partially occupied by Moscow-backed separatists since 2014. Russia's military leaders are pouring troops and equipment into the east of Ukraine in an attempt to force a bloody victory after they abandoned plans to blitz through Ukraine's north and seize Kyiv earlier in the war. Britain's ministry of defence yesterday said Putin's troops in the east are still struggling to make ground despite the renewed support, citing poor tactics and the deployment of low-skilled troops as reasons for the slow progress. 'Shortcomings in Russian tactical coordination remain. A lack of unit-level skills and inconsistent air support have left Russia unable to fully leverage its combat mass, despite localised improvements,' the MoD tweeted. 'Russia hopes to rectify issues that have previously constrained its invasion by geographically concentrating combat power, shortening supply lines and simplifying command and control,' it said. Agentstvo media outlet reported that Gerasimov was flown out of the war zone initially by an Mi-8 military helicopter to Belgorod in western Russia - the site of what is suspected to be yet another strategic strike on a Russian military site by Ukrainian armed forces. Three Ka-52 attack helicopters circled as the Mi-8 transported Gerasimov and other top brass. Then in Belgorod he boarded a Defence Ministry Tu-154 plane which flew to an unknown destination. Founder of independent Conflict Intelligence Team Ruslan Leviev said an eyewitness at the airport had seen Gerasimov board the plane unaided. 'The source confirms that it was Gerasimov who flew away,' he posted. 'But he went on board himself, alive and well.' His wounding by the Ukrainians would be another deep psychological blow to Putin and his faltering war campaign. Gerasimov is in charge of the Russian war campaign alongside defence minister Sergei Shoigu, who was a mainstay in the early days of the war but was largely sidelined in late March amid rumblings of a falling out with Putin and suspected health concerns. The Russian army's chief of staff was flown out of Belgorod just as new videos emerged showing a military site in the region on fire - one of many Russian sites which have mysteriously erupted into flames in recent days. Kyiv has not acknowledged carrying out any of the attacks - which have also hit railway bridges, fuel depots and ammo dumps - but is widely thought to be orchestrating them. The attacks are thought to be part of an attempt to cripple Russian supply lines close to Ukraine's eastern border, where Russian troops and armour is massing and forcing its way towards the front lines. Today's attack in Belgorod is not linked to Gerasimov's wounding.  Meanwhile in Mariupol, around 100 Ukrainians have been evacuated from the Azovstal steelworks despite the factory suffering intermittent Russian airstrikes, according to Zelensky. It comes as a UN 'safe passage operation' began yesterday, when officials reached the site in the decimated port city in southern Ukraine.  The city is under almost total Russian control but some Ukrainian fighters and around 1,000 civilians are thought to be holed up in the Azovstal works -- a vast Soviet-era plant founded under Josef Stalin and designed with a labyrinth of bunkers and tunnels to withstand attack.  Zelensky said this afternoon that a group of about 100 people were being evacuated from the steelworks and are to be taken to Ukrainian-controlled territory in Zaporizhzhia. 'Tomorrow we'll meet them in Zaporizhzhia. Grateful to our team,' he tweeted.  'Now they, together with #UN, are working on the evacuation of other civilians from the plant.'  Approximately 60 Ukrainian civilians were also evacuated from an area near the steelworks over the past two days. They have now arrived at a temporary camp in Russian-held territory in the village of Bezimenne, around 30 km east of Mariupol, where they were receiving refreshments and care after weeks of suffering. The evacuation is being coordinated with the International Committee of the Red Cross, Ukraine and Russia, but no more details are being released for the safety of evacuees, said UN spokesperson Saviano Abreu. The cost of rebuilding Ukraine after invading Russians laid waste to parts of the country now stands at more than PS70billion ($88billion), a Ukrainian university has claimed.  As of April 26, the total amount of documented direct infrastructure damage to Ukraine stood at PS70.3 billion ($87.9 billion) with large amounts of residential buildings and roads in particular destroyed by Russian forces, according to the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE). The damage has been verified as part of an open-source data campaign by the KSE to document the damage done by the invasion as part of its 'Russia Must Pay' series  The Kyiv School of Economics was supported by Volodymyr Zelensky's government - included his Presidential Office, Ukraine's Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Infrastructure. The research shows the direct damage to Ukrainian infrastructure - but also estimates the knock-on effect of the war on Ukraine's GDP - compounded by loss of investment, a labour exodus and defence costs at between PS448 billion ($564 billion) and PS478 billion ($600 billion). The cost of the damages to roads and residential buildings account for the bulk of the large amount of money that will be necessary to rebuild Ukraine. Over 23,000 kilometres (14,000 miles) of road has been damaged so far to the tune of PS23.6 billion worth of damage. Damage on residential building have been some of the most gruesome that have come out of the conflict as civilians could be seen being targeted by the Russian fire in their homes.  Over 40 per cent of the 37,000 square meters of real estate were damaged, destroyed or seized.residential building losses are in the Donetsk region, with Kharkiv (23 per cent) and Chernihiv (12 per cent) also badly affected. Russian attacks have also dealt out damage on 173 industrial sites in Ukraine - with the most notorious attack coming on the steelworks in Mariupol where civilians were trapped inside while Russian fire rained down on them. Education in Ukraine will likely suffer without the investment that is being asked for - as 1401 schools, universities and kindergartens damaged by Putin's war machine in Ukraine in the first two months of the war. The damage was not contained to infrastructure either, with 95 religious buildings also bearing the brunt of Russian bombs and artillery. A majority of the damage to infrastructure was done in the heavily targeted regions in the east of the country. Putin's initial justification for the war was a 'so-called' denazification of the eastern parts of the country. The region has been under heavier attack because of its proximity to Russian territory - allowing troops to rearm without fear of significant reprisals. Boris Johnson vowed a 'new Marshall Plan' to rebuild Ukraine in the aftermath of Vladimir Putin's brutal war on March 9, after Volodymyr Zelensky invoked Churchill in a defiant and emotional address to British MPs in which he repeated his plea for a no-fly zone. Britain's prime minister promised to 'protect' and 'restore' Ukraine's freedom, sovereignty and independence as he warned: 'The level of disgust and outrage at what is happening in Ukraine is mounting around the world and the noose is tightening on the Putin regime.' He also declared his intention to implement a 'new Marshall Plan' after the war, in reference to the post-1945 American effort to revive the economies of Western Europe and create a bulwark against Stalin's expansionist USSR following the defeat of Hitler's armies. The release of the specifics of the damage done to Ukraine and its infrastructure also comes after the Ukrainian government announced that it will seek reparations from Russia in the aftermath of the war. Ukraine's deputy prime minister Yuliya Sviridenko declared on Friday that the Ukrainian government estimated PS431.5billion ($564.9billion) worth of damage had been inflicted since Russian troops rolled across the border on February 24 - including indirect damage to their economy. In a stunning Facebook post, Sviridenko, who is also Ukraine's minister of economic development and trade, said the damage to her nation's infrastructure alone totalled PS91bn ($119bn). She went on to declare 'the numbers are growing every day' and that 'Ukraine will seek reparations from the aggressor despite all the obstacles'.

  "9e84ed88e88fb53727dcc8bfe0175235928dc3d3c5b34040ef4bbf68": "Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Sunday praised President Joe Biden's new disinformation czar as 'qualified and neutral' despite a slew of Republicans criticizing her as partisan. Asked about that criticism on CNN's State of the Union, Mayorkas called Nina Jankowicz 'eminently qualified, a renowned expert in the field of disinformation.' 'And neutral?' host Dana Bash asked. Mayorkas answered, 'Absolutely so.' He also pledged the White House's new Disinformation Governance Board will not be used to monitor American citizens, despite mounting right-wing  concerns that it will be a tool for censorship and surveillance.  Conservatives have been voicing their opposition to the disinformation board since the Biden administration announced its creation last week. Jankowicz's appointment in particular has caught criticism, after her previous dismissal of reporting by the New York Post and DailyMail.com on Hunter Biden's laptop as a 'Trump campaign product.' The laptop's contents, some of which are reportedly linked to a federal tax fraud investigation into the president's son, had been dismissed in October 2020 by Democrats and mainstream media outlets as 'Russian disinformation' before being authenticated by the Washington Post earlier this year. A Wilson Center fellow who once advised the Ukrainian government, Jankowicz has also come under scrutiny for praising former British spy Christopher Steele.  Steele is behind the notorious and now-debunked Russia dossier that purported Trump had strong ties with Moscow.  Jankowicz also caught heat for an old tweet criticizing advertisements promoting mask-wearing at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised against public mask-wearing at the time.  Prominent Republicans like Florida Governor Ron DeSantis have compared the disinformation board to the 'Ministry of Truth' in George Orwell's dystopian novel 1984, claiming it's being done to silence right-wing voices. 'It's clear I mean, those criticisms are precisely the opposite of what this small working group within the Department of Homeland Security will do,' Mayorkas said on CNN's State of the Union. However, he acknowledged that the Biden administration 'probably could have done a better job of communicating what it does and does not do.' 'The fact is that disinformation that creates a threat to the security of the homeland is our responsibility to address, and this department has been addressing it for years.' The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced last week that it was creating the board in a bid to crack down on disinformation coming from Russia as well as disinformation spread by human smugglers to encourage migrants to attempt to cross the southern border.  Mayorkas said Sunday that the board will not have 'operational authority' but was vague when asked about exactly what it will do. 'We know the problems but it's still not clear to me how this governance board will act,' host Dana Bash pressed. Mayorkas answered: 'So what it does, is it works to ensure that the way in which we address threats, the connectivity between threats and acts of violence are addressed without infringing on free speech, protecting civil rights and civil liberties, the right of privacy.' 'The board -- this working group, internal working group -- will draw from best practices and communicate those best practices to the operators, because the board does not have operational authority.' The Biden official gave a firm 'no' when asked whether Americans will be monitored. 'What it will do is gather together best practices in addressing the threat of disinformation from foreign state adversaries, from the cartels, and disseminate those best practices to the operators that have been executing and addressing this threat for years,' he said instead. He drilled down the point during a separate interview on Fox News Sunday, claiming his department was not the 'opinion police.' 'There are people in the department who have a diverse range of views, and they're incredibly dedicated to the mission,' he said when pledging the board will not step on free speech. It comes days after Florida's GOP governor pledged his state would be 'fighting back' against the disinformation board and accused President Joe Biden of using it to attack his critics. 'You cannot have a Ministry of Truth in this country. We're not going to let Biden get away with this one. So we will be fighting back,' DeSantis said during a press conference. 'When you're not doing well, you have two options: You can try to do better. Or you can try to silence your critics. [Biden] is doing the latter.'  Meanwhile, Republican Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton said he would introduce legislation to defund the board. 'The Federal Government has no business creating a Ministry of Truth,' Cotton wrote on Twitter Friday. 'The Department of Homeland Security's 'Disinformation Board' is unconstitutional and unamerican, and I'll be introducing a bill to defund it.' House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy wrote on the platform: 'The Biden administration's proposed Ministry of Truth is completely un-American.' 'Republicans have already introduced legislation to stop it, and we will force votes and a discharge petition to defund this Orwellian idea,' he added. Reporting by Katelyn Caralle  President Biden has set up a 'disinformation' board headed-up by a woke so-called expert who's against free speech and tried to pour cold water on the Hunter laptop scandal.  Nina Jankowicz will head The Department of Homeland Security's Disinformation Governance Board as executive director, Politico Playbook reported Wednesday morning. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas did not disclose any powers that would be granted to the dystopian-sounding board while addressing lawmakers on Wednesday. He explained that the board would work to tackle disinformation ahead of the November midterms, particularly in Hispanic communities.  But Mayorkas did say that the new board would come under the Biden-era Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships (CP3), meaning it would have no powers to crack down on disinformation and will instead try to combat it by throwing money at what it sees as problems.  The (CP3) program provides communities with resources and tools to help prevent individuals from radicalizing to violence. Last year, CP3 awarded about $20 million in grants through its Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention Grant Program. It is unclear how much cash will be spent on the Disinformation Board.  Mayokras noted that the focus of the new board would be to stop the spread of misinformation in minority communities, including election misinformation ahead of the 2022 midterms.  He added that it would focus on the latest trend of misinformation allegedly targeting Spanish-speaking voters. No further details on the exact misinformation being deployed against these communities was shared.  Jankowicz, who revealed she was the head of the department following Mayorkas' meeting with lawmakers, tweeted: 'Cat's out of the bag: here's what I've been up to the past two months, and why I've been a bit quiet on here.  Nina Jankowicz had already made a name for herself before being appointed head of Biden's Russian disinformation unit. Jankowicz, 33, is a successful author who is currently eight months pregnant with her first child. She grew up in New Jersey and is dating Michael Stein. The couple are happily shacked up in a $1 million, three-bedroom, two-and-a-half bathroom property they own in Arlington, Virginia. Jankowicz, attended Bryn Mawr College and Georgetown University, before embarking on a glittering career in foreign relations. She managed programs to Russia and Belarus at the National Democratic Institute. Jankowicz also advised the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry on disinformation and strategic communications She serves on the Board of Trustees for the Eurasia Foundation and is a global fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center But the author is best known as a prominent woke voice online.   The Biden appointee's latest book, How To Be A Woman Online has just been released, and deals with the topics of internet bullying and trolling. She has complained about hordes of men tracking down her private Facebook and Instagram accounts after she appears on TV to try to follow her and find out more about her life. Jankowicz says she prefers strangers to follow her Twitter account, and speculates that many of those who criticize her online are jealous of her 'verified' blue check mark and media career.  She has identified five different types of trolls who target her most, including 'reply guy' types who insist on trying to meddle in all aspects of her life, including in how brown she toasts her bread.  Despite claiming to be a free speech campaigner online, Jankowicz has spoken out against the First Amendment.  Aligning herself with many online progressives who've begun to call for an end to unqualified free speech, Jankowicz recently tweeted: 'I shudder to think about if free speech absolutists were taking over more platforms, what that would look like for the marginalized communities...which are already shouldering...disproportionate amounts of this abuse.' She also said the prospect of Elon Musk taking over Twitter made her 'shudder.' But Jankowicz - who has a pet dog and a cat - has not joined thousands of other liberals who've vowed to quit the platform as a result of Musk's purchase.   'Honored to be serving in the Biden Administration @DHSgov and helping shape our counter-disinformation efforts.' She added that 'a HUGE focus of our work, and indeed, one of the key reasons the Board was established, is to maintain the Dept's committment (sic) to protecting free speech, privacy, civil rights, & civil liberties.' The Russia disinformation expert previously called the laptop of President Joe Biden's son Hunter a 'Trump campaign product'. This is causing questions over Jankowicz's ability to accurately judge disinformation now that several sources have come out confirming the validity of Hunter's laptop. Jankowicz also suggested last week that she opposes the The First Amendment because she thinks it is bad for 'marginalized communities' and called Elon Musk a 'free speech absolutist' because he wants to make Twitter more open to all voices.  The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to DailyMail.com's request for comment.  Jankowicz is a fellow at the Wilson Center where she studies the 'intersection of democracy and technology in Central and Eastern Europe'. She is also the author of How To Lose the Information War: Russia, Fake News, and the Future of Conflict.  When stories about Hunter Biden's laptop started emerging, several outlets, social media sites and left-leaning disinformation experts claimed that it was just misinformation coming from Trump and others on the right. In an October 2020 report, Jankowicz shared her skepticism of the contents of the laptop and the claims it belonged to Hunter. 'We should view it as a Trump campaign product,' she told the New York Daily News at the time. Twitter repeatedly took down the Hunter Biden laptop story and prevented it from being spread on the platform. Billionaire Elon Musk, who just purchased Twitter, said that his aim is to make the social media platform a more open 'digital town square.' 'Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,' Musk wrote in a statement upon the purchase approval. Jankowicz spoke with NPR last week and questioned Musk's purchase of the platform and 'I shudder to think about if free speech absolutists were taking over more platforms, what that would look like for the marginalized communities,' she said. She said these groups are 'already shouldering...disproportionate amounts of this abuse' and said free speech and lack of censoring on social media would make it worse. Missouri Republican Senator Josh Hawley tweeted an image of her remarks to NPR with the caption: 'The Biden Administration's new anti-speech czar is apparently no fan of the  @elonmusk Twitter acquisition.' 'This is the person Joe Biden just put in charge of policing Americans' speech. Using the power of the government.' Jankowicz has advised the Ukrainian government on strategist communications - she also managed democracy assistance programs to Russia and Belarus. She received her masters in Russian, Eurasian, and East European Studies from Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, and her bachelors degree from Bryn Mawr College.  ",
  "d93b464c0e967f8aab6dee9c09efdfb11314daf90ed5dd2b830bcf07": "Celebrities, journalists and politicians have descended at the Washington Hilton on Saturday to attend the 2022 White House Correspondents Dinner, which returns after being canceled two years in a row due to the pandemic.  Reality TV star Kim Kardashian and her boyfriend, Pete Davidson, led the star-studded cast arriving at the gala, with other big names including Drew Barrymore, Martha Stewart, Chris Tucker and Academy Award-winning actor Michael Keaton.  The White House Correspondents' Association Dinner serves as a celebration that brings together big names under one roof to take part in jabs and roasts in the otherwise serious Capitol.  For years, comedians have poked fun at political leaders and journalists alike at the Correspondents' dinner. Previous hosts have included Conan O'Brien, Jimmy Kimmel and Seth Meyers.  The Daily Show's Trevor Noah was the first comedian to headline the event since Michelle Wolf in 2018, when she sparked controversy with jokes about the Trump administration.  The White House Correspondents' Association previously said that the dinner will offer 'the first opportunity since 2016 for the press and the president to share a few laughs for a good cause.'  Proceeds from the event support the White House press corps' work, scholarships for aspiring journalists and awards for those in the profession.  The Bidens' presence at the event is a return to form after former President Donald Trump snubbed the dinner while he was in office.  Every president since Calvin Coolidge had attended the WHCA's annual dinner with the exception of Trump.  Notably missing from this year's event is Biden's top COVID health expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who said he would skip the event over COVID concerns.  'He has made the decision that he wants to attend, in a safe way, the White House Correspondents' Dinner to show his support, showcase his support for a free press,' White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said.

  "6673f726fca02c61a17e6df45e8c4ef52f9f741cc6df617ca55078c3": "A possible motive for the slaying of crime kingpin 'Mr Big' has come to light as underworld sources reveal he was extorting other gangsters from his prison cell. Mahmoud 'Brownie' Ahmad, 39, was gunned down while visiting an associate in a suburban street in Greenacre at 9.30pm on Wednesday night, after a $1million bounty was placed on his head.  He only walked free from jail six months ago after serving a five-year sentence for killing a gangland rival. The development comes as police undergo a major crackdown on criminal groups in the wake of the brazen shooting, with Comanchero enforcer Tarek Zahed slapped with handcuffs on Friday.   In the lead up to his death, Ahmad had demanded friends of one of his fellow inmates cough up about $250,000 to ensure his safety.  'He (Ahmad) bashed one bloke in jail and extorted him, he made his friends on the outside pay up or else he would continue to harass him - it was about $250,000,' an underworld source told the Daily Telegraph. Ahmad is also believed to have set his sights on rinsing Sydney businessman Omar Eloma, favouring extortion due to a lack of patience to carry out a hit.  Daily Mail Australia is not suggesting Zahed or Eloma are in anyway responsible for the killing of Ahmad.  The source said while he hadn't been too bright, he 'had big balls'.  'If Brownie bumped into you (a rival) in the street, he'd shoot you on the spot,' he said. 'That's how wild he was.' The new details come as the national sergeant-at-arms for the Comancheros was brought down by police in Sydney and charged with two counts of contravening serious crime prevention order. The 41-year-old is widely tipped to be the next national president of the outlaw motorcycle club after former leader Mick Murray was also arrested last week.  Police will allege that Zahed failed to notify officers of changes to his living arrangements while visiting NSW from Melbourne.  State Crime Command Director Detective Chief Superintendent Darren Bennett said the crackdown on criminal activity would last as long as needed.  'Specialist officers will continue to execute raids across Sydney's southwest as part of a targeted mission to dismantle criminal operations,' he said. Meanwhile, hundreds of mourners, many of them hooded, farewelled Ahmad on Friday amid a heavy police presence.  His killers still remain on the run after the 'big, big fish' of Sydney's underworld gangland war was gunned down while visiting an associate.  Police sources said Ahmad, also known as Mr Big, had no obvious connection to Greenacre, where he took his last breath on Wednesday night. He had more enemies than friends and detectives aren't shocked Ahmad was gunned down, after he repeatedly failed to heed their warnings to lay low following his release from jail in November last year. 'He's been warned in the past he was a marked man and as a result he didn't heed those words ... he was going about his normal business without a care in the world,' detective superintendent Doherty said.  But there are now suspicions that Ahmad may have been betrayed by someone he trusted when he arrived to visit his associate.  'He wasn't supposed to be here,' one police source told Daily Mail Australia. 'Whoever did this was given a heads up that they could find him here.' Homicide Squad commander Doherty said: 'It was a meticulous assassination ... they weren't going to muck around with this one.'   There are mounting fears of a retaliatory attack as the list of victims in Sydney's underworld war soars to nine in 18 months. 'You'd think the Hamzy's would call it,' the source said. 'There aren't too many left.' Earlier, a police officer explained how the Alameddine crime network were 'picking the Hamzy's off like flies'. It's still not entirely clear how Ahmad fits into the equation, but Homicide Squad boss Danny Doherty noted he had a lot of enemies. Just last October, Ahmad dodged another attempt on his life when he was tipped off about a planned hit on him in broad daylight at a park at Rushcutters Bay.  It's understood Ahmad had connections with the Hamzy and Alameddine wars but was also involved in a separate organised crime network.  Since 2020, NSW Police have focused considerable resources on a gangland war between the Alameddine and Hamzy groups which has seen seven people killed.  After a number of arrests and top-level Alameddine enforcer Masood Zakaria fleeing overseas the war appeared to have quietened. But Ahmad's death could ignite a new blood-feud police will have to contend with. Mahmoud 'Brownie' Ahmad went to Narelle Crescent, Greenacre on Wednesday night to visit an associate. Around 9.30pm, he was leaving when he was gunned down by 'a large hail of bullets' outside the home. More than one person 'lay in wait' outside the house before opening fire. Officers from Strike Force Raptor were in the area at the time and arrived to find a dying Ahmad lying in the street. 'The movements of Brownie Ahmed are being investigated,'  Homicide Squad Commander Detective Superintendent Danny Doherty said. 'He was at that address visiting an associate. 'He'd been there for a little bit and was leaving. 'What appears to be - whoever was in a car - as soon as he was out open in the street more than one person in that vehicle, someone's fired shots at Brownie Ahmed 'They've planned it. it's well executed and I suppose it was a meticulous assassination of a person they were going to kill.' 'They weren't going to muck around with this one, that's for sure.' ",
  "a277f944364a74555bed75269614633fdebd943a19a90cfbd263dd27": "Comedian Bill Maher slammed Twitter for flagging a tweet by satire site Babylon Bee, which posted a skit about the social media network's workers needing therapy after Elon Musk's $44 billion takeover.  'You do need a new sheriff,' the Real Time host said on his show on Friday night.  'This is well within what satire has always been.'  Maher backed Musk to turn Twitter into a 'town square' of thoughts and opinions rather than a 'left wing place.' The comedian said that Twitter was a place for people who want their news to reflect their politics.  Maher then took aim at President Barack Obama's opinion that Generation Z would figure out how to combat misinformation was way wrong.     'I'd much rather have Elon Musk making the rules that a 23-year-old who can't take the joke on Babylon Beeswax, or whatever the f*** that is,' he said. 'I mean, this is a generation that doesn't know what the word 'violence' means. They think 'violence' means 'anything I don't like.' Their standard of free speech is 'I'm uncomfortable.' That's not where the standard is, right?'  Maher, 66, brought up the takeover twice during his April 29 show that airs on HBO.  The first was during his monologue, and the topic came up again during the panel discussion with former Alabama Senator Doug Jones, New York Times writer David Leonhardt and MSNBC host Ali Velshi.  In April, it was announced that Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, acquired Twitter in a $44 billion leveraged buyout.   In his monologue at the top of the show, Maher joked that one of Musk's promises was to get rid of bots on Twitter. He quipped that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg responded to that promise, 'Why are you making it personal?'  Earlier this week, Musk tweeted that his next plan was to buy Coca-Cola and have the company begin using cocaine as an ingredient again. Maher joked, 'Sure, it's all fun and games, until Hunter Biden gets his head stuck in the vending machine.'  Maher told his guests later in the show that Twitter has 'failed' being a judge over what can and cannot be said in public discourse.   He continued, 'You failed when you threw the New York Post off of Twitter for talking about Hunter Biden's emails. And it turned out that was a real story. You failed when you said we couldn't read about whether COVID had come from a lab. You failed!' Turing his attention to conservative satire site The Babylon Bee, Maher mocked Twitter employees for flagging a video that accused them of being too sensitive.  Velshi chimed into the conversation saying that Facebook and Twitter needed to have conversations internally about the harm they are doing to Democracy.  That prompted Doug Jones to add, 'I'm all for the First Amendment, all Democrats are for the First Amendment for goodness sakes. But Russian bots do not have a First Amendment privilege in this country or on Twitter period.'   The former senator continued, 'Civics in this country is a relic of the past and we've got to get back to that. That's why you see different people on the one hand looking at the Jan. 6 riots was simply a group of tourists that were doing OK.'  When Maher referred to Twitter as a 'left wing place,' Jones retorted by saying, 'There's a lot of right wing garbage on there.'  In a separate part of the discussion, Jones said that the Democratic party had lost its way and that they should 'get back to giving those messages ...'We are working. We are doing things.'  Maher also said that he was worried about the lack of civics being taught in schools. The New York-born comedian said that all young people care about is whether or not their feelings had been hurt rather than learning about the first amendment.  In his concluding remarks on the Twitter takeover, Maher spoke about how the company had suppressed free speech about whether or not Covid-19 was created in a lab in Wuhan.  He said, 'We don't know where coronavirus came from, but there's no reason to think it couldn't have emerged from a lab. They have a lab in Wuhan that was studying coronavirus! And you couldn't even discuss this! I mean, that's outrageous!.' Maher stated his belief that Musk will 'fix' Twitter.  During the Overtime portion of the show, Velshi was asked about corporations taking stances on divisive issues.  Velshi said that it was important for companies to be mindful of their employees opinions when choosing stances in order to keep workers happy.  Maher turned the conversation back toward generations saying that anyone he knows who runs a company hates Generation Z and Millenials. He noted that although his show hires young people, 'we don't hire a*******.' ",
  "c6a8531fa03646643092c4fe07a2e49230b3658234839ad405def5d3": "A teenage girl was filmed being viciously beaten by two other girls - one of them her best friend - after her supposed pal  lured to a Texas park late at night, according to police and the shocking video. Maya Tremillo, 17, suffered a concussion, several cuts to her face and a sprained ankle after the shocking beating at Clifton City Park on April 18 by Savannah Walker, 17, and 17-year-old Ahliah Vestal, the Clifton Police Department said. The two girls were charged with aggravated assault.  A third unidentified suspect, who filmed the beatdown and posted it to Snapchat, was also taken into custody and charges are pending.  The girls attend the same high school in Clifton, about 35 miles northwest of Waco, and Maya was attacked by the other teens because of a spat over a boy, her distraught mother said.  On the day of the fight, Tremillo was told by Vestal - her best friend - to bring back some shoes she had previously borrowed, which the victim reportedly thought was an odd request, according to her mother.  But when Tremillo made it to the park and approached Vestal's car, she was attacked by Walker, who was coming out of the vehicle, local authorities confirmed. '[Walker] jumped out of the car and the other girl that was filming her also jumped out of the car with her phone, and then [Walker] started yelling at Maya,' Julie Kross - Tremillo's mother - told The US Sun.  'Maya turned away to go back to her car and [Walker] hit her in the back of the head and just jumped on her and started beating her,' she added.  The night before the attack, Tremillo and her mother had filed a police report against Walker, claiming in-person and online threats of alleged harassments.  'They were threatening to beat her up and said 'you better watch your back, we're gonna kick your ass,'' Kross said. ''It scared her and it scared me so we filed a police report.' Police reportedly told Tremillo and her worried mother that there was little they could do to handle the harassment claims, as no evidence of a crime having been committed had surfaced. During the fight, Walker reportedly told Tremillo to 'go file a report on that now.'   The brawl at the park stemmed from arguments between the girls over a boy, Kross added. She declined to reveal more over the incident.  A video that circulated online shows the two teenage perpetrators attacking Tremillo after one of them posted recordings of the fight onto her Snapchat story. Several selfies of Walker from that night were also shared.  One of them was captioned: 'Talk your fu****g s**t now b***h!!!' Another selfie was sent along with the threat: 'Keep my cousins name and my name out your f*****g mouth b***h don't play with me.' A third read: 'I'm okay guys untouched as always.' In response to the explicit footage shared on its platform, Snapchat said: 'Using Snapchat to share videos of someone being attacked is strictly against our rules. We encourage people to report harmful content to us immediately through our in-app tools. Even though Snaps disappear, we are still able to review reported content so we can investigate and take appropriate action.' The selfie-based app added that it is currently reviewing the shared content before taking any further steps. Tremillo was taken to a local hospital after being found at the park, where she was treated for a sprained ankle and a concussion, Kross revealed. However, Tremillo is having a harder time coming to terms with what happened than physically recuperating, her mother pointed out. 'She's obviously very traumatized, very depressed and I'm really worried about her emotionally,' Kross shared. '[Maya] is constantly looking over her shoulder and jumps when a car drives by. Physically, she's gonna heal, but I know the emotional things are gonna take longer,' she added. Although the two attackers have not received sentencing, Kross said she hopes Walker's anger issues will be addressed through potential counseling.  'But I do also hope there are consequences and they're serious enough to help them wake up and not do anything like this again,' she further said. 'I just hope the court system works and the judges will make a decision on what best to do with these girls.' Both Walker and Vestal are currently released on bond, which has not yet been publicly disclosed.  Clifton High School, where all three girls are students, said it will soon decide on appropriate disciplinary measures against the juveniles and that it will also address the incident to those who were present and watched the fight.  Meanwhile, Maya, who is expected to complete high school in May, will wrap up her senior year from home after recommendations from doctors. ",
  "8c5b505b4690ee0c8631c0035e030dd7d4537b73e79e9e66b80de4d9": "The Green Party today reiterated its desire for the UK to quit Nato - once the war in Ukraine has ended. Its co-leader Adrian Ramsay told Sky News he did not want to 'change structures in the middle of a conflict', but believes the UK's long-term aim should be to leave the military alliance. Nato has been given a new lease of life by Vladimir Putin's aggressive assault, with the alliance forming the bedrock of aid to Kyiv to help it fight back Russian forces. But asked on Sky News whether the Greens' position on Nato has changed as a result of the Ukraine conflict, Mr Ramsay confirmed it has not. Asked to confirm again that the Greens want the UK to leave Nato, he added: 'Yes, that is our long-term policy that we would like to see far greater focus on peacekeeping institutions and institutions that support a reduction in our nuclear weapons and countries moving away from nuclear weapons. 'But in the short-term, of course we are not proposing moving out of Nato in the middle of a conflict.' Mr Ramsay was elected last year alongside Carla Denyer, a Bristol city councillor and parliamentary candidate. They followed the party's recent tradition of co-leaders, replacing Jonathan Bartley and Sian Berry. He was deputy leader of the party from 2008 to 2012 and is the candidate for the proposed new North Suffolk seat at the next General Election. He told Sky: 'We have a long-term policy about reviewing what structures we need to have to build peace in the world and we have to remember this conflict has happened at a time when we are part of Nato, when we are still seeing nuclear weapons dominate. 'Of course we are not about changing structures in the middle of conflict and what we need to do at the moment is focus on how Ukraine can be supported in a wide variety of ways.' Mr Ramsay suggested the UK needs to focus on 'peacekeeping and getting the parties to the table' as well as 'stronger economic action'. He added: 'Across Europe we are still sending a billion euros a day to Vladimir Putin's war machine from buying Russian oil, gas and coal and we need to wean ourselves off this addiction, which of course the Greens want us to do. 'If we want to avoid funding that war machine and really put strong economic pressure on Russia, that has really got to be stepped up.' Meanwhile Lib Dem leader Ed Davey today suggested that the removal of Vladimir Putin from power in Russia would herald the end of nuclear weapons. He told the BBC that he supported the UK's nuclear deterrent but if someone else was in charge in Moscow 'maybe we can change the world'. However he downplayed the idea that it could be anytime soon, adding: 'The Conservative government want to cut the army by 10,000 troops, to the smallest number since pre-Napoleonic times.  'Liberal Democrats have actually supported them when they helped the Ukrainian army, that is good, we really need to get behind the Ukrainians.  'Be in no doubt, we think the nuclear deterrent should stay, but in the long term of course it would make a safer world if we could get rid of all nuclear weapons, I mean that's just, that's common sense.'",

When Kim, 41, and Pete, 28, arrived at the dinner, they were informed Stewart, 80, was sitting at the DailyMail.com table. Kim said she would be delighted to catch up with Martha, and the lifestyle legend made her way over to the reality star and the Saturday Night Live comedian to cheers from the audience. Stewart held hands with Pete as they posed with Kim. The pair had moments earlier made their red carpet debut together.  'This truly was one of the highlights of the dinner. It showed the glitz and glamor had returned to Washington DC,' a guest told DailyMail.com.  Kim and Pete, who started dating late last year, are sitting with ABC at the dinner as Kardashian's new reality show is now streaming on the Disney-owned platform Hulu. Martha, Kim and Pete were all guests at ABC News' glitzy invite-only pre-party where they were all seen posing with guests who wanted selfies.   Stewart, whose own ABC show - The Great American Tag Sale with Martha Stewart - is set to premier in May, is attending the dinner as a guest of DailyMail.com. Moments after meeting Kim and Pete, Stewart wrote on Instagram:  'We are at the Washington Correspondents' Dinner. Kim and Pete and I said our hellos while we await the President of the United States!  'President Biden is due shortly to address about 2,600 journalists and Trevor Noah is the master of ceremonies. I am a guest of DailyMail.com.' The White House Correspondents' Association Dinner serves as a celebration that brings together journalists, celebrities and politicians and often includes jabs and roasts at the otherwise serious Capitol.  Also in attendance were DailyMail.com columnist Meghan McCain and DailyMailTV senior correspondent Alicia Quarles.   The hour-long event also featured an opening skit by James Corden and Billy Eichner.   For years, a comedian has poked fun at political leaders and journalists alike at the Correspondents' dinner. Previous hosts have included Conan O'Brien, Jimmy Kimmel and Seth Meyers.  The Daily Show's Tevor Noah will become the first comedian to headline the event since Michelle Wolf in 2018, when she sparked controversy with jokes about the Trump administration.  Noah is expected to deliver his own roast against the Biden administration, and will most likely take a few jabs at Kim, the biggest celebrity attending the event.   The Bidens' presence at the event will also be a return to form after former President Donald Trump snubbed the dinner while he was in office.  Every president since Calvin Coolidge had attended the WHCA's annual dinner with the exception of Trump.  The White House Correspondents' Association previously said that the dinner will offer 'the first opportunity since 2016 for the press and the president to share a few laughs for a good cause.' Proceeds from the event support the White House press corps' work, scholarships for aspiring journalists and awards for those in the profession. After the dinner, Comcast and NBC News will host their famous after-party at the Kennedy Center with DJ Jaime Ferreira. Invitations to this party are harder to come by than seats at the dinner.  NBC Universal News Group decided to invite guests who are government heavy hitters, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, CIA Director Bill Burns, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, Principal Deputy White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, Director of the Domestic Policy Council Susan Rice and Deputy CIA Director David Cohen.

  "b8f619b6bcaa85e395fdbe2226533a1432eedca19dc5e9b44e833eee": "The cost of rebuilding Ukraine after invading Russians laid waste to parts of the country now stands at over PS70billion ($88billion), a Ukrainian university has claimed.  As of April 26, the total amount of documented direct infrastructure damage to Ukraine stood at PS70.3 billion ($87.9 billion) with large amounts of residential buildings and roads in particular destroyed by Russian forces, according to the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE). The damage has been verified as part of an open-source data campaign by the KSE to document the damage done by the invasion as part of its 'Russia Must Pay' series  The Kyiv School of Economics was supported by Volodymyr Zelensky's government - included his Presidential Office, Ukraine's Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Infrastructure. The research shows the direct damage to Ukrainian infrastructure - but also estimates the knock-on effect of the war on Ukraine's GDP - compounded by loss of investment, a labour exodus and defence costs at between PS448 billion ($564 billion) and PS478 billion ($600 billion). The cost of the damages to roads and residential buildings account for the bulk of the large amount of money that will be necessary to rebuild Ukraine. Over 23,000 kilometres (14,000 miles) of road has been damaged so far to the tune of PS23.6 billion worth of damage. Damage on residential building have been some of the most gruesome that have come out of the conflict as civilians could be seen being targeted by the Russian fire in their homes.  Over 40 per cent of the 37,000 square meters of real estate were damaged, destroyed or seized.residential building losses are in the Donetsk region, with Kharkiv (23 per cent) and Chernihiv (12 per cent) also badly affected. Russian attacks have also dealt out damage on 173 industrial sites in Ukraine - with the most notorious attack coming on the steelworks in Mariupol where civilians were trapped inside while Russian fire rained down on them. Education in Ukraine will likely suffer without the investment that is being asked for - as 1401 schools, universities and kindergartens damaged by Putin's war machine in Ukraine in the first two months of the war. The damage was not contained to infrastructure either, with 95 religious buildings also bearing the brunt of Russian bombs and artillery. A majority of the damage to infrastructure was done in the heavily targeted regions in the east of the country. Putin's initial justification for the war was a 'so-called' denazification of the eastern parts of the country. The region has been under heavier attack because of its proximity to Russian territory - allowing troops to rearm without fear of significant reprisals. Boris Johnson vowed a 'new Marshall Plan' to rebuild Ukraine in the aftermath of Vladimir Putin's brutal war on March 9, after Volodymyr Zelensky invoked Churchill in a defiant and emotional address to British MPs in which he repeated his plea for a no-fly zone. Britain's prime minister promised to 'protect' and 'restore' Ukraine's freedom, sovereignty and independence as he warned: 'The level of disgust and outrage at what is happening in Ukraine is mounting around the world and the noose is tightening on the Putin regime.' He also declared his intention to implement a 'new Marshall Plan' after the war, in reference to the post-1945 American effort to revive the economies of Western Europe and create a bulwark against Stalin's expansionist USSR following the defeat of Hitler's armies. The release of the specifics of the damage done to Ukraine and its infrastructure also comes after the Ukrainian government announced that it will seek reparations from Russia in the aftermath of the war. Ukraine's deputy prime minister Yuliya Sviridenko declared on Friday that the Ukrainian government estimated PS431.5billion ($564.9billion) worth of damage had been inflicted since Russian troops rolled across the border on February 24 - including indirect damage to their economy. In a stunning Facebook post, Sviridenko, who is also Ukraine's minister of economic development and trade, said the damage to her nation's infrastructure alone totalled PS91bn ($119bn). She went on to declare 'the numbers are growing every day' and that 'Ukraine will seek reparations from the aggressor despite all the obstacles'. Her promise to collect reparations comes after President Volodymyr Zelensky and the governor of Ukraine's national bank said their country 'should be rebuilt with Russian money' earlier this month. '$564.9 billion. This is the sum of the losses that Ukraine has suffered since the Russian invasion,' Sviridenko announced today via her official Facebook page. 'There are at least two methods for calculating the losses. The first is from direct destruction; the second is the calculation of losses from the overall impact of hostilities, including the deteriorating economic situation in our country, rising unemployment, blocking trade, declining consumer demand and more. The finance minister went on to reel off a list of eye-watering sums she said were the estimated financial losses inflicted on Ukraine by Russia's invasion, before adding: 'It is worth noting that every day the numbers change and, unfortunately, they are growing. 'That is why Ukraine, despite all obstacles, will seek compensation from the aggressor. Both by court decisions and by transferring to our state frozen assets of Russia. 'Evil will inevitably be punished and Russia will feel the full weight of its own criminal actions on the territory of Ukraine,' Sviridenko promised. Many Ukrainian cities have suffered indiscriminate Russian bombing campaigns, but the southern port city of Mariupol has been utterly devastated by constant Russian missile attacks and airstrikes for almost a month. On March 3, President Zelensky vowed that Ukraine will be rebuilt with Russian money, but the scale of the damage dealt to Mariupol and other cities since then is difficult to comprehend. Mariupol's mayor Vadym Boichenko said this morning that the situation is so dire that the port city must be completely evacuated. Boichenko said 160,000 civilians trapped in the city are encircled by Russian forces, with ever-dwindling supplies of food, water and medicine, while hundreds of citizens have already perished. Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs meanwhile said Russian troops are 'turning the city into dust', describing the situation in Mariupol as 'catastrophic' with people fighting to survive. The governor of Ukraine's national bank, Kyrylo Shevchenko, also shares Zelensky and Sviridenko's sentiment that Russia should be made to pay reparations to Ukraine in the aftermath of the conflict. In an interview earlier this month with the BBC, Shevchenko said some of the money for rebuilding could be supplied through multinational grants and foreign investment, but insisted that Russia should be forced to pay for the bulk of it. Russia is thought to have hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of funds stashed overseas which have been subject to US and EU economic sanctions as punishment for its invasion of Ukraine. Schevchenko suggested these frozen funds could be funnelled towards the effort to rebuild Ukraine after the war. 'The need for money will be huge,' he told the BBC. 'It could be fulfilled through loans and grants from multinational organisations and direct help from other countries. 'However a large share of financing is needed to be obtained as a reparation from the aggressor, including funds that are currently frozen in our allied countries.'",
  "6d78b595bf00c4c3c49c111be771d1ffcde773a8f645ccc67f8239a3": "Russian soldiers looted ancient Ukrainian gold while holding museum staff at gunpoint. A lab coat-wearing official led a squad of troops with machine guns into the Museum of Local Lore in occupied Melitopol, close to annexed Crimea on Friday. After inspecting thousands of the museum's most precious treasures with protective gloves and tweezers, the Russians took 198 with them. Brave staff hid the museum's 2,300-year-old Scythian gold pieces including a crown  in a dark cellar. Staff member Leila Ibrahimova said: 'We hid everything but somehow they found it.' When soldiers pointed guns at a caretaker and insisted he take them to the cellar, the man still refused, the New York Times reported. But the museum's new, Russian military-appointed director led the soldiers to the priceless gold. It's thought Putin will 'relocate' the Scythian treasures to Crimea in an effort to strengthen the region's cultural ties to Russia.  The Scythians were a family of fearsome nomadic tribes who lived in Ukraine, central Asia and the Middle East between the 7th century BC and the 2nd century AD.  Creators of the centaur myth and skilled users of the bow and arrow, the Scythians conquered swathes of Europe during the reign of the ancient Greeks, long before Genghis Khan or Charlemagne. They were also among history's most relentless punishers. Scythian soldiers scalped their slaughtered enemies and tied the skin to their horses  They then rubbed it in their hands till it was soft enough to be used as a handkerchief, according to an ancient Greek historian.  Herodotus wrote in 430 BC: '[A Scythian rider] hangs the handkerchiefs on the bridle of his horse, and is very proud of them. The best man is the man who has the greatest number.' Mayor Ivan Fedorov, whose city has been occupied by Russian troops from Crimea since February 26, said: 'The orcs have taken hold of our Scythian gold. 'We don't know where they took it. We don't know about its fate. But we hope we can get it back.' Mr Fedorov was imprisoned and 'psychologically tortured' for six days before he was swapped in a prisoner exchange. The Melitopol mayor told Pope Francis during an Easter visit: 'I understood that for Russians my life and the lives of civilians were worth zero.' Describing his detention by Russian forces, Fedorov said: 'They came to me at night with five or seven soldiers and spoke for about four or five hours, hard dialogue.' 'They wanted to make an example of me about what would happen if we did not agree to what the Russians wanted,' the mayor said.  It was 'psychological' rather than 'physical' torture, he said. 'Russian soldiers assumed that they would be welcomed but they were not... and that is why the Russians were very, very angry,' he said. 'There is no food in my city. There is no pharmacy. Half of my city is wrecked. More than 200 people have been kidnapped. It is not safe to walk the streets,' he said. Chilling CCTV footage showed the moment Fedorov had a plastic bag placed over his head as he was escorted out of a building and across Melitopol's Victory Square by 10 armed men. Dozens of heroic Ukrainian residents went out to protest against the mayor's kidnapping in Melitopol last month, with video showing the civilians brawling with Russian troops.",
  "34dd4b6078a5eebbaad40233af7c0fab4faf32e2b603b45d92453524": "Violence erupted in Paris today where 45 people were arrested as thousands of May Day demonstrators clashed with police to protest against the re-election of President Emmanuel Macron by attacking banks and throwing tear gas and fireworks at a McDonald's restaurant. Protest marches have been held around the world to mark International Workers' Day and while some remained peaceful parades, others escalated into violent clashes and destruction. At least 5,000 officers wearing riot gear were on duty in Paris on Sunday - with water cannons and armoured cars also deployed on the streets of the French capital. Tensions erupted in Paris, as some demonstrators smashed windows at some banks, a fast-food restaurant and a real estate agency, apparently partially the work of masked men dressed in black. French police moved in, firing rounds of tear gas.  Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said 45 people had been detained so far. Eight police officers were injured, he said, calling the perpetrators of the violence 'thugs' who were trying 'to stop the right to demonstrate.' Tear gas and baton charges were used against a mob close to Place de la Bastille, as banks and a McDonalds fast food outlet were attacked by protesters dressed in black hoods and wearing balaclavas.  Before the violence erupted, trade unionists and citizens carried banners that read 'Retirement at 60, Freeze Prices', 'Retirement Before Arthritis' and 'Macron, Get Out' in response to the newly re-elected President's plans of raising the retirement age to 65. 'The violence appears organised and directed at specific targets,' said an eye witness. 'Guys with black hoods and balaclavas are smashing stuff up while others scream for Macron to resign.' Today's riots followed street violence breaking out a week ago, when Mr Macron won a second term by beating far-Right rival Marine Le Pen in the presidential election. Macron beat Le Pen 58.5 per cent to 41.5 per cent to win the re-election last Sunday - but Le Pen produced her highest-ever level of support in her three attempts to become France's leader. His win was made official on Wednesday and he is yet to hold a Cabinet meeting before setting a date for his inauguration ceremony, which must be held by May 13. 'The May Day mobilisation must be as massive as possible,' said Philippe Martinez, general secretary of the General Confederation of Labour - France's largest trade union. 'Beyond the unions, citizens must take to the streets so as to make sure their social and environmental demands are made loud and clear.' Marches and meetings were being held across France, including in major cities beyond Paris, such as Marseille, Nantes and Toulouse. Radical groups due to take part included the Yellow Vests, who were behind regular riots in major cities such as Paris throughout Mr Macron's first term. Anarchists who frequently target buildings including banks and upmarket shops were also due to infiltrate the crowds. 'Some 5000 police and gendarmes are on duty, and they include riot control units,' said a Paris police source. 'May Day usually attracts crowds of up to 20,000, and this year is not expected to be any different.' There is particular anger at the spiralling cost of living, and Macron's plans to raise the pension age from 62, up to 65. Others - including the Yellow Vests - are unhappy with the entire system of government in France, saying that too much power is invested in the president. Jean-Luc Melenchon, the hard-Left politician who came third in this year's presidential election, was one of those leading the May Day march in Paris on Sunday. It was between two of the great protest squares in the city - Republic and Nation. Melenchon has called for all Left Wing parties to 'unite, and to regain the will to win', in time for legislative elections in June. Mr Melenchon's aim is to deprive Mr Macron of a working majority in the National Assembly, so making it harder for him to govern. Meanwhile, the governing Mayor of Berlin Franziska Giffey attended a rally today to mark International Workers' Day at Bradenburg in Germany anfd   May Day was in 1889 chosen as the date for International Workers' Day by the Socialists and Communists of the Second International. The traditional May Day protests are taking place around the world in London, Germany, Brazil and Cuba with tens of thousands turning up for the organised rallies. Demonstrators at Trafalgar Square in London were pictured holding banners that read 'Boycott P&O' following the disgraced operators decision to replace the nearly 800 experienced seafarers with cheap agency staff.  The London website read: 'May Day will be celebrating everything workers achieved through the Covid pandemic, those hit by it, and all our continuing battles to save jobs, public services and for fair distribution of the wealth workers create. 'The spivs and chancer friends of Government made a killing during Covid. Downing Street became a party centre. Ordinary people took the hits financially and medically. Workers health & safety is under attack. The Grenfell fire exposed what Government really think about protecting ordinary people.  'The environmental crisis poses a threat to us all, hitting the poorest most whilst the rich exploit the planet. The need for international solidarity has never been greater with so many facing physical threat and economic hardship.'",
  "24f3b8b6c7bd0c7c2332a39b3982730bf36bf8ce996504b6860fc54c": "Democrat Senator Joe Manchin is crossing the aisle to weigh in on a fierce GOP primary race in his home state of West Virginia. The centrist Democrat appeared in a Friday campaign ad attacking Donald Trump-backed House Rep. Alex Mooney, instead appearing to endorse his challenger, Rep. David McKinley. He also takes aim at President Joe Biden's failed $1.75 trillion Build Back Better plan, which Manchin himself killed when announcing his opposition to it late last year. Mooney and McKinley are fighting for the GOP nomination to represent West Virginia's 2nd Congressional District after the state lost a seat to redistricting after the 2020 census.  It's rare for sitting lawmakers to wade into a race pitting two incumbents against one another in a primary, much less so for the opposing party. Manchin is the only Democrat currently representing deep red West Virginia in Congress. Trump won the state by roughly 40 points in the 2020 presidential election. 'I've always said if I can't go home to explain it, I can't vote for it. And that's why I opposed Build Back Better,' the senator said in the TV spot. 'For Alex Mooney and his out-of-state supporters to suggest David McKinley supported Build Back Better is an outright lie.' He continued, 'David McKinley has always opposed reckless spending, because it doesn't make sense for West Virginia.' 'Alex Mooney has proven he's all about Alex Mooney. West Virginians know David McKinley is all about us.' Mooney has been floated as a potential Senate challenger to Manchin when he's up for re-election in 2024. Manchin's press secretary told DailyMail.com that the advertisement 'speaks for itself.' Mooney said Manchin's backing shows his challenger is a 'RINO,' or 'Republican In Name Only.' 'Further proof David McKinley is a complete and total RINO. Democrat Joe Manchin is endorsing him,' the GOP lawmaker wrote on Twitter. McKinley's campaign touted the ad on GOP fundraising platform WinRed, writing: 'Joe Manchin knows that I've always fought wasteful spending and opposed liberal policies that don't work for West Virginians.'  Manchin's fellow West Virginia senator, Republican Shelley Moore Capito, has not endorsed anyone in the race.  McKinley was one of 35 House Republicans to vote in favor of a bipartisan commission to investigate the January 6 Capitol riot, though he's since opposed the House Select Committee assembled by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. He also voted in favor of Biden's $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure deal, which both Trump and Mooney have attacked him over. 'Congressman Alex Mooney is a conservative warrior running in West Virginia's 2nd Congressional District,' the ex-president said in a statement last week. He bashed McKinley, declaring Mooney's 'opponent is a RINO who supported the 'Unfrastucture Bill' and the Sham January 6 Unselect Committee.'  'Alex fights for our Veterans, for Energy and Clean Coal, Election Integrity, our Borders, Jobs, and against the horrible drug epidemic. On May 10th, Vote for Alex Mooney, who has my Complete and Total Endorsement. I love West Virginia!' Trump-backed Mooney has out-raised McKinley by more than $3 million in this campaign cycle, according to the most recent filings through April 20.",
  "ca15ece6a097d3669060e28c4a4a8c70f9f042715781cbb4d4f249e5": "A black-clad Antifa mob in Prtland launched smoke bombs, paint, fireworks and rocks at Republicans supporting an Oregon GOP gubernatorial candidate who were demanding law and order be returned to the crime-plagued city. Video shows the intimidating group waving black flags and lobbing smoke bombs at the conservative crowd, which included children and elderly people, during the rally near Southwest 3rd Avenue and Southwest Main Street on Saturday.  'We're taking the city back. We're funding the police,' one man shouted from a megaphone. 'No longer are we gonna have the crime and the mayhem.' As the group demonstrated, a mob of close to a dozen Antifa protesters approached them and threw smoke bombs at them. 'Heads up, rocks!' one man shouts. Two people were injured and no arrests have been made, police said. The troubling incident came on the heels of another attack by the radical Antifa members who threw rocks from an overpass at People's Convoy truckers. Crime in Portland has skyrocketed in recent years. There were 91 homicides in the city last year, breaking the record of 66 murders in 1987, according to Oregon Public Radio.  The city also cut $15 million from the police budge during Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, but city lawmakers added $5.2 million back into police coffers last year. Pulliam, the mayor of Sandy, is running on a platform of tripling the size of the Oregon State Police and deploying the Oregon National Guard to end the violence in Portland's streets.  'The culture of criminality that our state has allowed to fester in Oregon's big cities must come to an end,' his website states. 'We need to back our local law enforcement officers and provide them with proper training and public support.' Demonstrators on Saturday held signs for Pulliam. The crowd included children and elderly citizens, according to footage shared on social media and on Pulliam's own account.   Police said paint and large fireworks were thrown and 'significant explosions were heard in the area' as Pulliam' supporters rallied. The conservative protesters later left the scene and met police elsewhere at their request. 'One adult male had an injury to the hand, an adult female complained of hearing loss. There was also evidence balloons filled with paint and/or other substances were thrown at people and vehicles,' police said. Later that afternoon, Mayor Pulliam tweeted: 'This is what happens when a Republican dares to hold an event in Portland to talk about funding our police. Antifa shows up. Well we won't be intimidated and stop speaking the truth.' On Friday, Antifa protesters allegedly threw paint and other objects at a 'People's Convoy' passing through Portland during what authorities called an 'extremely busy night' for the crime-ridden city. Portland police said at least five people on the Northeast Glisan Street overpass above Interstate 205 hurled objects at cars and trucks shortly before 7pm.  Video from that night shows multiple people standing on an overpass and throwing 'paint-filled bags' at the cars below them, according to footage shared on social media. One shot was fired, police said. No victims were reported, and it is not clear which side pulled the trigger.  One held a banner whose message was unclear, according to video shared on social media. They were protesting the 'People's Convoy' - an offshoot of Canada's anti-vaccine mandate 'Freedom Convoy' led by truckers who were protesting the country's vaccine requirements. At one point, traffic stops as members of the convoy seem to get into a verbal back-and-forth with the protesters above them. One voice behind the camera says there are 'four or five kids up there with masks on.' One shot was fired, but no one was injured. Police said they were 'monitoring a protest 'convoy' that was driving through Portland and counterdemonstrators confronting them. Officers determined that the shot fired call was likely related,' according to a statement released the next day. The Post Millennial reports John Hacker was a member of Friday's violent crowd. Last year, Hacker was charged with robbery in the third degree for stealing journalist Andy Ngo's phone and dumping liquid on him at a 24-Hour Fitness gym in Portland in 2019. Friday's overpass incident was part of an 'extremely busy night' that 'strained' the department's resources, police say.  The night's calls included a murder-suicide at 2.06am in the 14100 block of Southeast Woodward Street.  There was also a stolen ambulance that was seen driving recklessly and going on the sidewalk. The driver was arrested. Late last year, Portland became yet another city to re-fund its police department after calls to 'defund the police' during last year's Black Lives Matter protests led some municipalities to decimate their safety budgets. In November, Portland City Council unanimously passed a fall budget bump that added back $5.2 million of the $15 million it cut from police last year.  It comes as the city deals with murder rates not seen since the 1980s and a staffing shortage that has led city leaders to consider hiring back retired cops. 'Many Portlanders no longer feel safe,' Mayor Ted Wheeler said. 'And it is our duty, as leaders of this city, to take action and deliver better results within our crisis response system.'  Night after night, hundreds of people marched the streets of Oregon's largest city demanding racial justice after the murder of George Floyd by a white officer.  Among the rallying cries were 'defund the police' - a call for elected officials to reallocate some law enforcement funding elsewhere.  In June 2020, the Portland City Council and the mayor answered by cutting $15 million from the police budget. An additional $12 million was cut due to pandemic-caused economic shortfalls.  As a result, school resource officers, transit police and a gun violence reduction team - which was found to disproportionately target Black Portland residents during traffic stops, according to an audit in March 2018 - were disbanded.

  "ca10c17c334f09f4b024a5631616d10144500f073ad437621ef4a7dd": "Democratic Senator Bob Menendez said that Title 42 is 'not the solution' for the mass migration surge as Republicans push to keep the pandemic-era policy to stop a potential tripling in already record-breaking numbers. 'Title 42 is not the solution, it's part of the problem,' the New Jersey lawmaker told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday morning. 'There needs to be a comprehensive immigration plan,' he continued to host Chuck Todd. 'Our Republican colleagues, however, they want the issue, they don't want the solution.' Many Democrats are joining Republicans in calls for the Biden administration to keep Title 42 in place after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced last month that the policy will end on May 23. The Democrats who oppose the policy ending claim that there is not a good alternative to quell the record-breaking surge in migration at the southern border. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said on Fox News Sunday that 'there is unanimity about the fact that the [immigration] system is broken.' Mayorkas also told Todd in his interview with Meet the Press Sunday morning that he 'respectfully disagrees' with Republican criticism over allegedly prematurely ending Title 42. 'What have you said to the Democratic senators, more of whom - particularly those running for reelection - who have questioned the plan about Title 42?' Todd asked the secretary of the department threading immigration agencies. 'They feel like - that there's sort of a disconnect,' the NBC anchor continued. 'They think the plan that you've outlined is a bit unrealistic. Do you think their criticism is fair?' 'Well, it's not an issue of fair or not,' Mayorkas conceded. 'I respectfully disagree with the criticism.' Title 42 is a public health policy that allows for immigration agencies to expel migrants from the U.S. without hearing their asylum claims in the midst of a public health emergency. It was enacted during Donald Trump's presidency in March 2020 and has been upheld and defended in court by President Joe Biden. Menendez, a Democrat who does want Title 42 to end, argues that while it is still in place, migrants are able to try and re-enter multiple times without facing legal precautions because their asylum claims were never processed and denied or approved. 'Who, who wants to control the border would permit a provision that allows countless numbers of times an individual can try to cross the border?' the senator questioned. 'That's what Title 42 does.' 'There's no permanent adjudication of those who have a right under asylum and those who do not have a right and then would have an order of deportation - and if they try to come back there would be criminal penalties for it. That would stop it,' Menendez assured. Mayorkas insisted Sunday morning that there is a plan to stop the surge and fix the 'broken' immigration system, but explained that he will not lay it out for the public for fear of adversaries using that information. 'You know, we shared with individuals, with the public, a concept of operations, and they were concerned that that was not enough. They didn't see enough, that we don't have a plan,' the secretary told NBC News. 'We've had a plan for months, as I mentioned since fall of last year, for the eventual end of Title 42. So what I did was I published a 20 page memorandum that set forth greater details about our plan.' 'But what I'm not going to do, Chuck, is I'm not going to provide an extraordinarily comprehensive blueprint of everything we're doing because let's remember, we have an adversary. We have the cartels that are exploiting vulnerable immigrants for profit, and I'm not going to provide them a blueprint with what we're doing.' Even though the CDC made the decision to end the policy, Biden will pay the political price. The administration has said if courts decide the policy should remain for now, it will comply and extend Title 42. Republicans point out hypocrisy in Biden's team ending Title 42 without also putting an end to the declared public health emergency - and there are a few bipartisan bills on Capitol Hill right now attempting to extend the policy until the declaration also ends. Mayorkas told Fox News host Bret Baier on Sunday morning that it is time to get back to normal U.S. immigration policies, which includes hearing asylum claims from migrants who cross the border and say they fear for their life in returning to their home country. Biden has face increased criticism for lack of action at the southern border, leading to record-setting illegal immigration figures of upwards of 2.5 million since he took office last January. In March alone, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) encountered 221,303 migrants crossing the southern border from Mexico into the U.S., up from the 165,894 in February. The previous decades-high was set in July 2021, about six months after Biden took office, when CBP encountered 213,593 migrants. Internal estimates predict that the number of crossings could rise from the current 8,000 each day to 18,000 per day once Title 42 ends later this month - others claim crossing could close to triple as early summer tends to produce the highest number of crossings each year. Images emerged recently of caravans of migrants from several different countries heading to the U.S.-Mexico border from the south. The matter is further complicated by a slew of Ukrainian migrants fleeing to the U.S. from Eastern Europe after Russia launched a full-scaled invasion in late February.",

The UK's elite forces are preparing for reconnaissance missions in Mali have been operating in the region for almost 10 years, opting to ride camels rather than mechanical vehicles according to a senior military source. 'Vehicles need to be maintained and refueled every few days - the vehicle logistical support is a real hindrance,' said the source. 'Camels store fat in their humps and can go for up to 10 days without needing food and water.' The idea was reportedly hatched when the special forces started employing local Bedouin guides, a nomadic Arab tribe who has inhabited the region and used camels for centuries. Vehicles used in missions have been stymied by mechanical issues, clogging up with sand, according to the Mirror. A senior military source said camels were more efficient. The UK deployed a task group 300-strong to Mali in December 2020 to support the UN peacekeeping mission, which is made up of soldiers from 56 different countries. The SAS have been deployed to the region, but the reports mark the first public acknowledgements that the forces have emulated the tactics of Thomas Edward Lawrence, the British officer made famous for his role during the Arab Revolt of 1916. Lawrence of Arabia was the name given to a British Intelligence Officer, who fought alongside Arab guerrilla forces in the Middle East during the First World War. The SAS has its origins in desert warfare, when elite British forces were dropped deep within the north African desert during World War II. It was formed as 62 Commando in July 1941 to undertake small-scale raids behind enemy lines, drawing its men from No 7 Commando and also operating under the title L Detachment, Special Air Service Brigade. The term 'brigade' was usually used to refer to a unit of 5,000 men -- a title the SAS adopted to deceive the enemy into believing the force was larger than it was in reality. The SAS was created during the Second World War, when small bands of soldiers were dropped behind enemy lines in North Africa and Europe. The news comes as Vladimir Putin launches a search for British SAS forces alleged to be fighting in western Ukraine. The Kremlin's Investigative Committee (IC), often referred to as Putin's personal CIA, said it will look into 'the facts of the activities of British SAS saboteurs in Ukrainian regions,' in particular Lviv, according to state-controlled outlet RIA Novosti. Earlier on Saturday, the IC claimed that 'at least two groups of specialists in sabotage and guerrilla warfare from the British Special Air Service (SAS) have been sent to the Lviv region'. An IC source claimed SAS operatives in Ukraine 'are specialists in sabotage and partisan activities, recruiting and training agents to work in hostile territory'. Russia appears to base its investigation on information allegedly received from captured Ukrainian troops. The SAS is 'considered one of the most highly qualified in the world in organising coups d'etat, mass protest rallies, contract killings of political figures, recruiting agents, including those in the highest echelons of power, and preparing terrorist attacks', said the RIA Novosti report. 'This is no ordinary special force - these are intellectuals, in each group there is always an ideologist, you can say a professor, and the rest are particular specialists,' said a Russian law enforcement source. The report claimed that the SAS often work in war zones under cover of medical workers. 'With a high degree of probability, these specialists arrived in order to improve the skills and efficiency of the Ukrainian special services in coordinating the activities of sabotage groups in the territories of Ukraine controlled by Russian troops,' said the IC source. The committee is headed by Russia's top criminal investigator, Alexander Bastrykin, who was a university classmate of Vladimir Putin's. Earlier this month it was reported that SAS troops have trained local forces in Kyiv for the first time since the war began. Two officers from separate battalions stationed around the country's capital said special forces had trained their troops on two occasions in early April. British military trainers have had a presence in Ukraine since Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014, but were withdrawn in February as the likelihood of Putin ordering an all-out invasion of Ukraine increased. A UK defense source said they do not comment on stories related to special forces.",
  "8ec2b7ee1c0cc1c99b896d63c354cb12c321a25c6c3bb409e8e2459d": "An emotional Volodymyr Zelensky has vowed Ukraine will always remember the support of Australians in the wake of Russia's bloody invasion.  Australia has provided humanitarian and military aid to the besieged nation with the government sending 20 refitted Bushmaster vehicles as part of a $50million package. The heroic Ukrainian leader, who sat down with 60 Minutes reporter Tom Steinfort, said he would like to give a special message to those watching at home. Staring straight down the camera, the president said the support Australia had provided his war-torn country in its time of need was unforgettable.  'You have to know that Ukraine will always remember, it will be written in our history books about your help, thanks a lot,' a visibly emotional Zelensky said.  The veteran reporter had flown in with his production team to an undisclosed bunker in Kyiv to spend some time with the revered world leader who has faced down Vladimir Putin and Russia's invading forces.  Mr Zelensky revealed it's hard for people overseas to comprehend the full extent of the horror currently unfolding in the eastern European nation. 'It's very difficult for them. You can't feel the pain before you lose someone. You can't feel the pain until you're wounded,' he replied.  'I am not wishing anyone to feel that pain, I'm just telling that this is the feeling.' Steinfort then asked his high-profile guest what he imagined victory would look like.  'To return what is ours, to return the calmness, the tranquility, to have our people returned. I don't need anything extra,' Mr Zelensky said.  The Australian journalist had attempted to gift the president a packet of Tim Tams and an expensive bottle of red wine before the gifts were confiscated and sent away for testing - amid fears Russia has been trying to poison the president. Steinfort had wanted to give the iconic chocolate biscuits and Penfolds wine to the president after he agreed to an interview with the Nine Network, but tough security restrictions in place to protect the president from assassins would not allow it. The team received a text message at 10.39pm informing him of the location before he went to the undisclosed bunker in the capital. Ukrainian soldiers stopped Steinfort at the door before confiscating the items, he wrote for the Sydney Morning Herald. 'We need to send these away for testing before giving them to the president, we can't risk radiation poisoning,' the soldiers told Steinfort. Steinfort said his production team had to pass through several roadblocks being patrolled by armed troops, follow soldiers down a concealed alleyway and go through an x-ray machine before meeting Zelensky. 'There, we have to put all of our equipment through x-ray machines, go through more passport checks, and are then handed to the dog squad who sniff our belongings for explosives,' he wrote. The production team were led to the same room where Zelensky had met with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken for face-to-face talks days earlier.  Steinfort said Zelensky pulled him to the side to chat with him briefly before the cameras recorded the interview. The Ukrainian president had nothing but praise for Australia.  'Before our cameras roll, he wants to tell me about how much he loves Australia - volunteering a story about when he visited Sydney many years ago, and got lost on a morning run,' Steinfort wrote. 'He says he was struck by how many complete strangers offered to help this random Ukrainian find his way back to his hotel.'  Prime Minister Scott Morrison says there is no rush to deal with the issue of Russian President Putin attending the next G20 leaders' summit. Mr Putin and Mr Zelensky have agreed to attend the G20 summit to be held in Bali in November. Russia is a member while Mr Zelensky would attend as an invited observer. G20 host leader and Indonesian President Joko Widodo has spoken with Mr Zelensky and Mr Putin, urging them to end the war and offering to play a role in peace negotiations. Indonesia has rejected the Ukrainian leader's request for arms on constitutional and foreign policy grounds, but instead will send humanitarian aid. Mr Morrison told reporters in Sydney on Sunday the issue of Mr Putin's attendance 'still has some distance to travel'. He said Australia would consult with other like-minded countries, but the key was to ensure the Indonesian summit was successful. 'We don't know what the situation (in Ukraine) will be in November of this year,' Mr Morrison said. Bushmaster armoured vehicles that Australia is sending to Ukraine amid the deadly war against Russia are refitted and repainted with a heartfelt message BY KYLIE STEVENS Australia has ramped up its support for Ukrainian forces by sending $50million worth of military vehicles to assist in the European nation's ongoing war with Russia. The first convoy of 20 refitted Bushmaster vehicles will leave Brisbane on aircraft C-17 Globemasters. Australia is one of the first countries to provide combat vehicle support to Ukraine as the Russian invasion enters its sixth week. The armoured vehicles have been repainted olive green with Ukraine's flag stencilled on each side.  The words 'United with Ukraine' are also emblazoned on the vehicles in both English Ukrainian in a pledge of solidarity. The vehicles have been fitted with radios, a global positioning system and additional bolt-on armour, along with protection against mines, artillery shrapnel and small arms fire. 'Australia may be thousands of kilometres away but we're standing side by side with Ukraine against this illegal invasion with arms, equipment, aid and even energy sources,' Prime Minister Scott Morrison said. 'Once again Ukraine has asked for our help and once again we have stepped up.'   'Our Australian-designed and made Bushmasters are known around the world for their usefulness in a combat zone and they will help boost Ukraine's defence against Russia's unprovoked and illegal violence. 'This fight is important because not only are Ukrainian lives and their lands at stake, but so are the principles of freedom and the rule of law.' The military support is the result of a request from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy after he addressed federal parliament a week ago. It's on top of almost $120million in military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine. The retired Bushmasters previously been used by Australian forces in Iraq, Afghanistan and disaster zones at home. 'It is one of the world leading vehicles and it provides protection to the crew that are onboard that,' defence minister Peter Dutton told the Today show on Friday. 'It will be a big win for the Ukrainian forces in their attempts to stare down the barbaric efforts of the Russian forces.' Meanwhile, Mr Morrison and more than 200 other Australian officials have been banned from entering Russia. The ban is in response to foreign minister Marise Payne declared Australia will take action against 67 elites linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin in a new round of sanctions. Mr Dutton said Australia will continue to stand with Ukraine again tyranny and autocrats. 'People have fought and died for the freedoms that we have in our country. We need to realise we just can't take for granted what we have - our system of democracy and freedom of speech,' he said. 'These are values that dictators like Putin and Hitler and others will always be against. We need to stand up against them.' The Bushmaster Protected Military Vehicle (PMV) - or Infantry Mobility Vehicle - is an Australian built, four-wheel drive armoured vehicle that has seen action in several wars. Nicknamed 'The Bushy,' the PMV is designed to transport troops safely through war zones and to deploy them on the front-lines.",
  "18b9bd543917cd10b33394a695c66de56669d5246d25484c97948383": "Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates has warned there is a 'way above five percent' risk the world has not yet seen the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic. The tech mogul and philanthropist said he did not want to sound 'doom and gloom' but warned there was a risk an 'even more transmissive and even more fatal' variant could be generated. 'We're still at risk of this pandemic generating a variant that would be even more transmissive and even more fatal,' Gates told The Financial Times on Saturday.  'It's not likely, I don't want to be a voice of doom and gloom, but it's way above a 5 percent risk that this pandemic, we haven't even seen the worst of it.' It is not the first time he has made such a prediction. In December 2021, he warned his millions of Twitter followers to brace themselves for the worst part of the pandemic having previously cautioned in 2015 that the world was not ready for the next pandemic. COVID has killed an estimated 6.2 million people worldwide since March 2020, but case numbers and deaths have been dropping in recent weeks. Gates' warning comes after Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), this week warned that people still needed to be wary of the virus, and that decreases in overall testing and COVID surveillance in many countries have left the world at risk to a resurgence of the virus.  Gates - who releases his new book How to Prevent the Next Pandemic on Tuesday - advised governments across the world to invest in a team of epidemiologists and computer modelers to help identify global health threats in the future. He called his plan the Global Epidemic Response and Mobilization initiative and said it should be managed by the WHO - the only body he claimed was capable to build and manage the 'top-notch' team of experts at a cost of around $1billion per year. 'The current WHO funding is not at all serious about pandemics,' Gates said, adding that 'less than 10 full-time people' were working on outbreak preparedness and 'even those people are distracted with many other activities'.   Gates' comments come as COVID cases in the U.S. continue to grow, rebounding after months of declines coming off of the massive winter Omicron-surge.  Like the surge this winter, deaths have remained low despite a rise in cases, showing the decreasing danger the virus poses as more mild strains continue to circulate. The nation is currently averaging 60,251 COVID cases every day, a 52 percent jump over the past week - and the first time the 60,000 mark was reached since March 1. In the time since then, daily cases continued to plummet down to 30,000 per day, where the figure sat for weeks in mid-April. Deaths from the virus are at one of their lowest points during the pandemic, even as cases begin to sharply rise once more.  The nation is averaging 327 deaths from the virus every day at the moment, a ten percent drop over the past week - maintaining the least deadly period of the pandemic since August 2021. Despite the overall mortality of the virus having faltered in recent months, U.S. regulators are still pushing to expand vaccine eligibility to include children aged six months to five years old, and to even open up fourth doses to all Americans. COVID cases have more than doubled over the past two weeks in eight U.S. states, with the cases even tripling in West Virginia. These case rises are largely attributable to the BA.2 'stealth' variant, a sub-lineage of the Omicron variant that erupted over the winter. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report that the strain makes up 68 percent of COVID cases in the U.S. Another version of the variant is beginning to emerge as well. Two weeks ago, the CDC began to officially track the new BA.2.12.1 strain - a sub-variant of the 'stealth' variant.  It first emerged in New York last month, before becoming the dominant strain in the region, and spreading across much of the rest of the country. The strain makes up 28 percent of total cases in America. The rate of COVID-19 deaths in New York City, the hardest struck city in the world by the virus, has shrunk to only two per day, as the virus recedes in America and a majority of the population heads towards a return to 'normal'. The WHO has been among the more cautious, even contrarian, voices throughout the pandemic, continues to issue grave warnings about the state of the virus while many began to enjoy dips between surges. '[Rolling back of COVID surveillance] makes us increasingly blind to patterns of transmission and evolution. But this virus won't go away just because countries stop looking for it. It's still spreading, it's still changing, and it's still killing,' Ghebreyesus said on Tuesday. Across America, and in some parts of Europe, COVID testing and tracking has been significantly scaled back as officials move to divert funding that went into pandemic related efforts elsewhere. In the U.S., funding used to cover the costs of free testing for many Americans has been pulled. Hospital treatment for the virus is no longer covered by the federal government either. Cuts to testing have been so severe that some experts warn over 90 percent of cases may be going undetected in the U.S. 'The threat of a dangerous new variant remains very real - and although deaths are declining, we still don't understand the long-term consequences of infection in those who survive,' Ghebreyesus continued. 'When it comes to a deadly virus, ignorance is not bliss. WHO continues to call on all countries to maintain surveillance.'   Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert and one of the other most-cautious voices during the pandemic is even starting to relax on the state of the virus. On Tuesday, he told PBS NewsHour that America is beyond the pandemic, though it is still existing elsewhere in the world. 'If you're saying, are we out of the pandemic phase in this country, we are. What we hope to do, I don't believe -- and I have spoken about this widely -- we're not going to eradicate this virus. If we can keep that level very low, and intermittently vaccinate people -- and I don't know how often that would have to be,' he said. 'That might be every year, that might be longer, in order to keep that level low. But, right now, we are not in the pandemic phase in this country. Pandemic means a widespread, throughout the world, infection that spreads rapidly among people. 'If you look at the global situation, there's no doubt this pandemic is still ongoing.' He then backtracked on his statements the next night, telling CBS News his comments had been misconstrued. 'We certainly can't say the pandemic is over,' he said Wednesday. 'It is not over.'",
  "08f03d54960161a5e9bc88cc1d5cec60d157cad023e414a6f3c240e6": "An Australian Jihadi fighter jailed for flying to Syria to join an Islamic terror group is back in prison after allegedly failing to notify police he was importing fake luxury handbags and selling them online. Mehmet Biber, 29, was sentenced to a minimum of two-and-a-half years in 2018 after pleading guilty to entering a foreign state intending hostile activity.  The Sydney resident had tight restrictions placed on his movements and activities by the Australian Federal Police as a condition of his release.  Part of Biber's control order forbids him from undertaking paid work without first notifying the police. The alleged breach  means he could face a further five years in prison if found guilty.  Biber, who was the first Australian citizen sentenced under foreign incursion laws, is accused of importing counterfeit handbags and selling them on Facebook Marketplace for a profit.  Counter-terrorism expert Professor Greg Barton told Channel 10 News that although the breach may seem innocuous, 'looking at his case history he very quickly could have been in trouble with more serious actions'.  He added that the concern is not about him selling goods on Facebook Marketplace, but reconnecting with extremists online and exposing him to further radicalisation.  The 29-year-old was just 20 when he flew to Syria via Turkey in 2013 to join the violent terror group Jabhat al-Nusra which fell under the control of the al-Qaeda network. Biber returned to Sydney just six months later in February 2014.  He was arrested and sentenced to four years and nine months with a non-parole period of two and a half years.  Although the charge carried a maximum sentence of 20 years, the judge took Biber's youth and naivety at the time of the trip into account as mitigating factors.  Biber's bail has been formally refused and he will return to Parramatta Local Court on May 4. ",
  "a53d6329b153193f2e8275b95841ffc1b20b663adfcfe868c1ca7903": "Tech giant Microsoft has launched an editing tool which advises writers to type 'assigned female at birth' rather than 'biologically female', days after Google introduced an 'inclusive language' function on its search engine. Microsoft's new tool, which users can opt out of, advises people to avoid using the term 'biologically female', as well as suggesting 'postman' be changed to 'postal worker', 'Mrs' to 'Ms' and 'mankind' to 'humankind'. The technology company said the feature has been introduced to help users avoid any implication of gender bias. However, critics accused Microsoft of censoring language while contradicting the biological meaning of the words 'woman' or 'female'. Last week it was reported that Google had launched an 'inclusive language' function designed to avoid the use of politically incorrect words.  Helen Staniland, a software developer and feminist activist, told the Telegraph that Microsoft's new feature appears to be trying to influence how people discuss social issues, and accused the company of 'jumping on the bandwagon'. She said: 'What do they mean by gender bias? Why are they suggesting that the perfectly descriptive phrase 'biologically female' might imply a gender bias? Why would they presume that 'assigned female at birth' might be better? 'It seems that they are trying to jump on the bandwagon of attempting to prevent discussion of 'biological females', but their suggestions don't help them.' A spokesman for Microsoft said the new feature can be turned off at any point and stressed that the alternative words were just 'suggestions' and not 'autocorrections'. In a statement, the spokesman said: 'Microsoft understands that not every Editor suggestion may be suitable for all users and all scenarios. That's why we let users be in control of their final output. 'Editor is a completely optional tool that users can turn on or turn off at any point. Editor does not make any autocorrections, all suggestions are just that - suggestions for the user to consider - and the user has control over which suggestions they choose to use, if any. 'In Word, users will have control at the critique/suggestion level as they will be able to turn on and off each one of them individually.' Many computer document systems use methods to correct spelling and grammar, but nudging users towards woke language is being seen by critics as a step too far.  Tests on Google's new system have thrown up some major flaws.  A transcribed interview with ex Klu Klux Klan leader David Duke, in which he uses offensive racial slurs and talks about hunting black people, prompted no warnings. But it suggested President John F Kennedy's inaugural address should say 'for all humankind' instead of 'for all mankind'.   Users typing 'landlord' would see a warning that it 'may not be inclusive to all readers' with the suggestion they should try 'property owner' or 'proprietor' instead. Similar to Microsoft, the word 'humankind' was a suggested alternative to what the Google apparently sees as the controversial term 'mankind'. Silkie Carlo, of campaign group Big Brother Watch, told last week's Sunday Telegraph that Google's new word warnings 'aren't assistive, they're deeply intrusive'. A Google spokesman said: 'Our technology is always improving, and we don't yet [have] a solution to identifying and mitigating all unwanted word associations and biases.'",

  "1c09e40536a61aa6c52f1e67d892a7cf9893f3a09f199e93a800b5bb": "A ninth Russian general was reportedly killed in a Ukrainian artillery strike near Kharkiv. Major General Anton Simonov, 55, died during the attack on a Russian army command past in northern Ukraine, President Zelensky adviser Alexey Arestovych said yesterday. Mr Arestovych told YouTube livestream viewers he was informed by well-placed army sources. Simonov would be the ninth and youngest Russian general killed so far in the latest blow to Putin's disastrous invasion of Ukraine. He was seen as the Russian military's leading electronic warfare specialist.  Simonov died in a devastating fightback by the Ukrainians against a Russian offensive. Simonov led electronic warfare within the 2nd Combined Arms Army and is a former cyber commander of the Western Military District. Footage of the strike on the Izyum command post on April 29 was re-shared after it emerged Simonov may have been killed.  The Ukrainian Army said it destroyed 30 Russian vehicles during the artillery assault. Simonov's alleged killing adds to the 36 colonels and more than 300 Russian officers who have died in Ukraine so far. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defence claimed this morning it has killed 23,500 Russian soldiers, destroyed 1,026 tanks and wrecked nearly 200 planes since the war began. Daily Mail foreign columnist Ian Birrell tweeted: 'Russia is losing one general a week on average in Putin's disastrous war, which must be an almost unprecedented rate of attrition for such senior officers.' But Sinonov's death alongside 100 Russian troops - and the reported loss of armoured vehicles - indicates another setback for the Kremlin leader.  Putin has aimed to declare the success of his mission on 9 May, Victory Day in Russia, marking the anniversary of the end of the Second World War. From Kirov region, the Major-General was a graduate of the Tomsk Higher Military Command School of Communications. Just two weeks ago Russia's eighth slain general Vladimir Frolov's grave in St Petersburg was pictured. Frolov 'sacrificed his life so that children, women and the elderly in Donbas would not hear bombs exploding again', the St Petersburg governor said as his friend was laid to rest. The general was from a military family and 'died the death of the brave in battle against Ukrainian nationalists', Alexander Beglov added. He was 'a true patriot, a brave and courageous man' who 'honestly and to the end fulfilled his military and human duty. 'People will not forget their heroes. Eternal memory to him.' He became the 42nd high-ranking officer known to have died in a war that has haemorrhaged Putin's top brass. The scale of the death toll invalidates Vladimir Putin's claim that his 'special military operation' is going according to plan.

  "2ac757becffb4c102c0d9d9cd1942408f26b9ea60e260a7b17482791": "President Joe Biden mocked his own low approval rating and called the Trump administration a 'horrible plague' as members of the press poked fun at him during the annual White House Correspondents' Association Dinner.  'Tonight, we come here to answer a very important question in everybody's mind. Why in hell are we still doing this?' Biden quipped as he took the stage in the room full of journalists and D.C. insiders.  'I know there are questions about whether we should gather here tonight because of COVID. Well, we're here to show the country that we're getting through this pandemic. Plus, everyone had to prove they're fully vaccinated and boosted,' he said. 'Just contact your favorite Fox News reporter they're all here vaccinated and boosted.' He then addressed his historically low poll numbers for the first time, claiming that journalists were the only people who were less well-liked. 'I'm really excited to be here tonight with the only group of Americans have a lower approval rating than I have,' Biden said.  However, Biden wasn't the only one to embrace comedy at Saturday's affair. The Late Late Show James Corden opened the dinner with a sketch of him taking over the duties of Press Secretary Jen Psaki, which included a cameo from a reporter she regularly clashes with, Fox News' Peter Doocy.   Comedian Trevor Noah mocked the administration for rising inflation rates and took jabs at Florida Governor Ron DeSantis' possible presidential candidacy after the state banned dozens of math books earlier this month.  Corden eagerly took to the podium to take questions from reporters following a briefing with Psaki and Biden, but the ill-prepared Corden was immediately flanked with complicated questions from reporters.  Among them was Doocy, who Biden was recorded calling a 'stupid son of a b****' in January, with Psaki echoing similar remarks earlier this month. Biden reportedly called Doocy afterwards to apologize. Despite the critical comments from them, Doocy played his part in Corden's sketch on Saturday, appearing straight-forward and no-nonsense as he took on the fumbling comedian.  Doocy asks the 'interim-press secretary', 'When the president says one thing, and White House staff say something else, who are we supposed to listen to? The president, or White House staff?' 'Well you know what, David,' the comedian, appearing fed up by the questions from all the reporters.  'That's not my name,' Doocy quickly replies. 'You say your name is not David. I say your name is David,' Corden snaps back.  'And I'm stood up here and you're sat down there - unless you wanna be sat at the back with whoever they are' Corden added as he threatened to move Doocy to the far-end of the press room.  Corden's sketch also involved digs at the Biden administration as Psaki told him that the CDC is 'good,' to which he replies, 'Really? 'They've been pissing me off.' Psaki also tells him that the economy is strong, with Corden again questioning the validity of the statement.  'Is it,' he asks doubtfully as Psaki moves on to the rest of the briefing.  Psaki was in a live taping of the Pod Save America podcast on April 14 when she was recorded criticizing Doocy and Fox News, saying: 'He works for a network that provides people with questions that, nothing personal to any individual including Peter Doocy, but might make anyone sound like a stupid son of a b***h.'  The Press Secretary has since stressed that she was not deliberately attempting to insult the Fox News White House correspondent, but instead criticizing the news outlet.  Following the insult, Psaki tweeted: 'Full video shows I also told a story about Peter's grace last night and made very clear I was not being critical of him or any reporter at Fox, and instead was critical of the slant of some Fox topics.  'He is doing his job. I am doing mine. We debate. We disagree. I respect that.' Despite the insults from the president and press secretary, Doocy has remained composed and said he would just like to move forward after he accepted Biden's apology.  Also at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, Trevor Noah slammed the administration for rising consumer costs, taking aim at what analysts predict is a looming recession. The Daily Show Host touted Biden for coming out to the event on Saturday, saying he doesn't know why the president would miss a chance to hear all about his supposed accomplishments. 'You know, I think ever since you've come into office, things are really looking up. Gas is up. Rent is up. Food is up. Everything,' Noah joked about inflation, which is at the highest it's been in 40 years. Noah also took aim at Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, and used the former Republican president as a gateway to roast DeSantis. '[If] Trump was the original Terminator, DeSantis is like the T-1000,' Noah said of the Florida governor. 'You're smarter than him, you're slicker than him, you can walk down ramps. 'Because you see, Trump said he won the election, but everyone was just able to look at the numbers and see he was wrong.  'That's why Ron DeSantis is one step ahead,' Noah said, referencing the fact that Florida tossed out 41 percent of the 132 math textbooks submitted for the next school year, more than half of which the state said referenced Critical Race Theory (CRT), with the rest containing Common Core and Social Emotional Learning (SEL). 'First you ban the math textbooks, then nobody knows how to count the votes,' Noah quipped. 'Boom, my man!' President Joe Biden kicked off the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner on Saturday with his own quips about his administration and his political rivals.   'I'm really excited to be here tonight with the only group of Americans have a lower approval rating than I have,' Biden, who FiveThiryEight's latest poll has him at a 41.7 approval rating, told the journalists, celebrities and politicians attending the event. 'Well, that's hard to say after what we just saw this the first time President attended this dinner in six years.' 'Well that's understandable - we had a horrible plague, followed by two years of COVID,' the president added.  'Imagine if my predecessor came to this dinner this year. Now that would really have been a real coup that occurred,' Biden said, taking jabs at the January 6 Capitol riot. 'Folks, I'm not really here to roast the GOP. That's not my style. Besides, there's nothing I can say about the GOP that Kevin McCarthy hasn't already put on tape,' Biden quipped, referencing the leaked tapes of the House Minority leader saying he would ask former President Donald Trump to resign after January 6. 'At the same time, a lot of people say the Republican Party's too extreme too divisive to control by one person. They say that's not your father's Republican Party. Ronald Reagan said Mr. Gorbachev, tear this wall down. Today's Republicans say 'Tear down Mickey Mouse's house.'  And pretty soon they'll be storming Cinderella's castle. You can be sure that Republicans seem to support one fella. Some guy named Brandon. He's having a really good year. I'm kind of happy for him,' Biden said, referring to conservative rallying cry 'Let's Go Brandon.'  Saturday night's event - attended by reality TV star Kim Kardashian and her boyfriend, Pete Davidson, and other big stars including Drew Barrymore, Martha Stewart, Chris Tucker and Academy Award-winning actor Michael Keaton - saw Biden mock himself by addressing his low approval rating of 41.7 and his predecessor, Donald Trump.  'Well, that's hard to say after what we just saw this the first time President attended this dinner in six years.' 'Well that's understandable - we had a horrible plague, followed by two years of COVID,' the president added.  'Imagine if my predecessor came to this dinner this year. Now that would really have been a real coup that occurred!' Biden then turned his attention to Republicans, and the leaked tapes of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy claiming he would ask President Trump to resign after January 6. 'Folks, I'm not really here to roast the GOP. That's not my style. Besides, there's nothing I can say about the GOP that Kevin McCarthy hasn't already put on tape,' Biden said to a room full of chuckles.  'At the same time, a lot of people say the Republican Party's too extreme too divisive to control by one person. They say that's not your father's Republican Party. Ronald Reagan said Mr. Gorbachev, tear this wall down. Today's Republicans say 'Tear down Mickey Mouse's house.'  'And pretty soon they'll be storming Cinderella's castle. You can be sure that Republicans seem to support one fella. Some guy named Brandon. He's having a really good year. I'm kind of happy for him,' Biden said, referring to conservative rallying cry 'Let's Go Brandon.'  Biden then introduced comedian Trevor Noah, who is headlining the event, who mocked the large maskless gathering.   'It is my great honor to be speaking tonight at the nation's most distinguished super spreader events,' Noah said. 'No for real people. What are we doing here? Let's be honest. What are we doing? Like did none of you learn anything from the Grid Iron Dinner?'  Dozens of high-profile attendees tested positive for COVID-19 after attending the exclusive media event weeks earlier.   'Do you read any of your own newspapers? I mean, I expect this from Sean Hannity, but the rest of you What are you doing?,' he added.  'I spent the last two years telling everyone the importance of wearing masks and avoiding large indoor gatherings. Then the second someone offers you a free dinner you'll turn into Joe Rogan. I mean, Dr. Fauci dropped out,' Noah said. 'That should have been a pretty big sign. Fauci thought it was too dangerous to come tonight. Pete Davidson thinks it's okay,' Noah said, pointing to Kim Kardashian's date.  Noah then turned his focus to the president.   'As you all know, President Biden's lack of a filter does get him into hot water sometimes, you know, last month he caused a huge international incidents saying that Vladimir Putin should be removed from power was very, very upsetting to Russia,' Noah said. 'So someone explained to them that none of the stuff Biden wants actually gets done.' In late March Biden made waves by proclaiming Russian Leader Vladimir Putin 'cannot remain in power,' remarks that the Kremlin replayed on state TV airwaves as a personal attack on Russia.  Noah then turned his attention to Psaki, who is reportedly in negotiations with MSNBC for a contract after she soon leaves the White House.  'The word on the streets is actually that Jen Psaki is going to MSNBC next month. Yeah. Yeah, apparently just being on C-SPAN the ratings are too high. And she wanted more of a challenge, you know, want to switch things up? She can't laugh at that. Don't put the camera on her.'  'You know, moving to MSNBC is going to be a big switch for you because right now your current job is to make the Biden administration looks as good as possible, you know, at all costs. Now you're going to be at MSNBC and you're going to have to .... you'll be fine actually,' he quipped.  'By the way MSNBC, can I just say you guys are doing great work. I love watching your shows you know when Trump was in office, your shows were all about how bad he was. And now that Biden's in office, your shows are all about how bad Trump was. Consistency is important.' Noah then poked fun at CNN's Jeffrey Toobin, who was caught masturbating on a work call.  'We're celebrating without you don't get comfortable. Not too comfortable, Jeffrey Toobin, not too comfortable,' Noah said. 'No, you know what? No, don't don't do him a bunch of haters. You know what? So what Jeffrey, you made a mistake. You whipped it out in front of your coworkers.' 'Where is Jeffrey Zucker?' Noah asked, referring to CNN's former head, who left after it was revealed he was having a relationship with a colleague.  'Jeff got fired off because he tried to keep his workplace relationship secret, which is weird, because if he really didn't want anyone to know about him, he could have just made a show about it on CNN Plus!'  'I know I know. It's so sad. CNN Plus gone, but forgotten,' Noah added, referring to CNN's now-failed streaming venture.  'I blame John King. That's true. Yeah, John, your magic wall can predict how every person in the country is going to vote in every county, but it couldn't give you a heads up that nobody wanted more CNN,' Noah added.  He then turned his attention to CNN's gratuitous use of the 'Breaking News' banner.  'My man over there, Chris, as the new head of news. His first order of business hire guy who knows how to turn off the breaking news banner. What happened with that they just put it on during the OJ chase and then never figured out how to get rid of it? The news is not always breaking!' Noah also directed his wise cracks at Fox News, as he turned to the White House press corps: 'Everyday you demand answers on the pressing issues of the day. And then Fox News asked about Hunter Biden. And I'll be honest, though, I actually think that's a good thing. I really do. I think people need to be held accountable if they're using their dad's name to get ahead in life. I can't think of anyone better to ask about that than Peter Doocy.' Doocy's prominent role with the channel came after his father Steve Doocy joined the channel.  He then turned his attention to primetime host Sean Hannity, who is dating Fox host Ainsley Earhardt. 'Sean Hannity and Ainsley Earhart's actually dating now. Yes. And I actually think it's beautiful to see an office romance of folks that won't enter the $20 million settlement. Yeah. I'm sure whoever Roger Ailes is right now. He's looking up and smiling.'  'Laura Ingram - wow. What can you say about her that hasn't already been said by the anti-Defamation League?' Noah added. Then came Tucker Carlson.  'Tucker Carlson Are you kidding me? I mean, he's a beast who else could fill an entire show each night asking questions that Google could easily answer. 'Do vaccines work? Who really won the election? Who is the president right now? Is this America?' Noah said.  The comedian also took a minute to thank the reporters in the room for their duty as the fourth estate to make sure those in power are held accountable by the people, and noted that being able to roast a sitting president was a luxury afforded to him by America's freedoms.  'I stood here tonight and I made fun of the President of the United States, and I'm going to be fine,' Noah said.  But, he made one last dig at Biden as he concluded the evening, referencing the U.S.'s frenzied withdrawal from Afghanistan.    'Please be careful leaving tonight. This administration doesn't handle evacuations. Well. Good night, everybody.' ",
  "764e59f9a1b12127a677d2d42f26d5e8f1aa17c84853a56cd9c800ba": "A man convinced he had Covid taped his car shut and stayed inside for ten hours without even opening the window. The Beijing resident had decorators round that morning who told him they tested positive, the China News Service reported. At midday on Tuesday he got into his slick white coupe and didn't move till 10pm, despite never getting tested for the virus. 'I knew my chances of being infected are very high, so I tried to avoid contact with anyone to avoid troubles with others', he explained. 'Immediately after I knew about this, I stayed in my car without even opening the window. That was what I should do for public health.' Images show the man's car was sealed from the outside with tape and stickers referencing Covid. He did not address this in his comments. Finally at around 5pm he ordered KFC, but still didn't leave the vicinity of his car to retrieve it. The man said: 'It was a contact-free delivery. The delivery man put my food by the roadside and I went to pick it up after he left.' His story was shared by the state-backed news agency in an apparent effort to rally the public behind extreme measures seen throughout the country. Beijing tightened restrictions today, while Shanghai let some of its 25million residents venture out for light and air after reporting a second day of zero infections outside of quarantine areas. Beijing, with dozens of daily infections in an outbreak now in its 10th day, has not formally locked down. More than 300 locally transmitted cases have been logged since April 22. But on Sunday the capital tightened social distancing rules and launched a fresh round of mass testing in its most populous and worst-hit district. In the past week the city of 22 million has conducted mass testing in most of its 16 districts, suspended all entertainment venues and closed restaurants. 'The impact of all this on us is too great - 20,000  In Shanghai residents have turned to social media to vent their frustration, some clanged pots and pans outside their windows. Others have clashed with public health workers. The song 'Do you hear the people sing?' from the musical Les Miserables has become a popular protest anthem.  On Saturday, an online video of a Chinese orchestra playing the song, with the musicians performing from their respective homes, went viral with nearly 19,000 shares before it was blocked. While much of the city remains in lockdown, Shanghai officials, striking a confident tone, said on Sunday that curbs on some areas would be eased after the city reined in COVID transmission risks at the community level, excluding cases in quarantine centres. Public transport will be allowed to resume in five districts, but residents must remain in their districts as they visit supermarkets, pharmacies and hospitals, a health official told the news conference. Social media posts showed the streets of Fengxian, one of the six districts, filled with pedestrians and choked with scooters and bicycles. Reuters could not independently verify the videos. But despite the fall in transmissions, Shanghai will launch a new round of citywide PCR and antigen tests from today till May 7. Excluding imported cases arriving from outside the mainland, China reported 8,256 new local cases for Saturday, down from 10,703 a day before.  Beijing accounted for 59 of the infections, while Shanghai saw 7,872 new cases and all of the nation's 38 fatalities. China has pursued a Zero Covid strategy despite  experts' warnings that the Omicron variant spreads too quickly to be contained by lockdowns, in a year when Xi Jinping is expected to secure an unprecedented third term as president.  President Xi reaffirmed his commitment to the policy on Friday, putting China at odds with much of the world.  While many countries are dropping restrictions and trying to live with the virus, China is keeping its international borders largely shut and closing off entire cities to all but essential travel. That includes Shanghai's shipping port, a lynchpin for global trade. China's largest city entered its second month of draconian measures today after weeks of inhumane restriction from child-parent separations to the erection of walls around people's homes. Buildings where cases were found have had entrances sealed up, with a small opening for Covid prevention guards to pass through. 'This is so disrespectful of the rights of the people inside, using metal barriers to enclose them like domestic animals,' said one Weibo user. Another video showed residents shouting from balconies at workers as they set up fencing. The workers relented and took it away. Other videos showed people trying to pull fences down. 'Isn't this a fire hazard?' commented one user. There are increasing concerns over the impact on the Chinese economy, with a leading Hong Kong equity investor warning the nation is in 'deep crisis'. Weijian Shan said on Friday the nation is in its 'worst shape for 30 years'. The Xi ally also told the private meeting: 'While we remain long-term confident in China's growth and market potentials, we are very cautious towards China markets', in comments reported by the FT.",
  "70a4babbf17db6ef3bc15f735005fb4428e2366944de8af20ad4c67b": "Furious British expats have blasted Spanish bureaucrats after they were banned from driving in Spain following a failure to reach a post-Brexit agreement on UK driving licences. From today, tens of thousands of Brits living in Spain are banned from using their UK driving licence on Spanish roads - but this change does not apply to holidaymakers who are exempt from the new rule. Until now, Britons living in Spain have been able to use their DVLA-issued licences. Every other European country has now agreed a post-Brexit deal apart from Spain. According to USwitch, passing your driving test in Spain is almost double the cost in the UK and averages between PS700 and PS1100. Although the driving lessons are slightly cheaper, taking your theory is PS50 more expensive than the UK and Spanish tests also require registration fees alongside a copy of your health documents.  British expats have since taken to social media to complain about the 'backwards' policy, which has left many unable to travel to work or their local town. Ward Priestman, who lives in Spain with his wife Ann-Marie, said the Covid pandemic 'delayed Spanish residency permits being issued' and left him unable to sign up with a driving school to start the process. Writing on the Facebook group, Brits in Spain, Ward Priestman said: 'That's us screwed, due to the pandemic our TIEs [Spanish Foreigner Identity Card] were delayed and we didn't get them until the April after the deadline.  'I have no idea what we are going to do, we live up in the mountains in the middle of nowhere. Why on earth is this so hard?'    Maria Matches, who lives in Cordova in Spain, took the advice of Hugh Elliot, UK's Ambassador to Spain, when negotiations were announced in February - however she has not been able to book dates for her practical test, which only takes place twice a month. She added: 'Okay, we took the ambassadors advice in February, the earliest we could do this and signed up with a driving school. We've now passed our theory and are awaiting dates for our practical - which in Marbella only takes place on one day twice a month - and to date they are fully booked.  'Getting a Spanish driving licence does not happen overnight. We've made the effort as advised but are still thwarted by time scales and availability.'  Expats David Waddington and Nigel Thomson also complained about the 'inadequate' process that has left many Brits struggling to pass their Spanish driving test.  If you have been resident in Spain for longer than six months, your UK-issued licence will no longer be valid to drive here from 1 May. Driving a vehicle without a valid licence is illegal in Spain.  If you are affected by this change and need to drive, you should not wait for the outcome of the ongoing negotiations and should take immediate steps to apply for a Spanish licence. This does not affect visiting motorists from the UK or Gibraltar or UK licence holders who have recently moved to Spain.  You have six months from the date you get your residence document to take a Spanish test. Mr Thomson added:  'We moved to Spain on 13 December 2020 and started the residency process immediately. Sadly, although granted early 2021, it wasn't in time to be able to apply for driving license conversion.  'Due to the uncertainty with all these extensions I applied to sit my Spanish driving test. Even although I've had a clean license for 40+ years. I passed my theory on the second attempt... this certainly is not an easy exercise for expats. The translation of the questions is appalling.' Mr Waddington added: 'It's a total disgrace!'  It comes as last night Whitehall sources blamed Spanish bureaucrats for delaying talks and missing the April 30 deadline.  Tory MP Sir Iain Duncan Smith criticised the Spanish authorities, saying: 'It's a case of 'Manana, manana [tomorrow, tomorrow]'. It's time they pull their finger out and do what they agreed.'  A UK Government source said: 'This could go on for a week or it could be longer. It should be temporary but we don't know how temporary. In the meantime, British residents living in Spanish hill villages won't be able to drive a car.' A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'An agreement to swap UK driving licences for Spanish licences has not yet been reached. 'From May 1, UK licence holders who have been resident in Spain for more than six months and did not exchange their licence during the transition period will no longer be able to drive legally in Spain. We have agreed to rapidly accelerate talks and are urging the Spanish Government to bring forward interim measures.' Until a deal is struck, UK expats will need to obtain a Spanish driving licence before getting back on the road.  One user on Twitter, known as Philip, said the new policy was yet another 'obstacle' for Brits who work in Spain or want to retire - whilst another user added it was stopping them from 'continuing their work' with a dog charity.  Malaga-based Sam Britton-Beese said: 'It's ridiculous. Our application for residency was still in process before the deadline so we couldn't register to exchange.'  Linda Rogers, originally from Coventry, said: 'Our house is in the mountains and nothing is close by - I've tried to get into a driving school but nothing is available.' The DGT, the Spanish equivalent of the DVLA, and Spain's ministry of interior, were approached for comment last night.  Holidaymakers on all-inclusive packages are being restricted to six alcoholic drinks a day at hotels in parts of Ibiza and Majorca. Under new rules announced earlier this year in a bid to reduce anti-social behaviour, only three tipples are allowed at lunch and three at dinner, with guests having to pay extra if they want more.",
  "fa74a916b8515db30306ae68c6feb229bac86b35ed7044af7f6919b8": "Coleen Rooney tried to reach a settlement with Rebekah Vardy over their 'Wagatha Christie' libel case three times - as court documents show she kept 'sting operation' hidden from husband Wayne. Coleen, 36, says she was 'confident in the truth' when she publicly accused Mrs Vardy of leaking 'false stories' about her private life to the media in October 2019. Mrs Vardy, husband of Leicester striker Jamie, denies the allegation and is suing for libel.  Court documents have now revealed that Coleen offered to settle out of court in May and October 2020 and January 2021, The Sun reports. A witness statement says: 'I would like to highlight at the outset that I have sought to resolve this matter amicably on various occasions. 'I was of the view that the time, money, resources and efforts involved could be better spent elsewhere, particularly in light of the pandemic. However, the efforts I made . . . were all in vain.' And explaining her plan to uncover who was responsible for the leaks, she adds: 'I did not mention this plan or the content of the Sting Operation to anyone or discuss it with any person at any time. 'Nobody knew the detail of what was going on apart from me. It killed me not telling anyone about it but I managed it.' Their explosive week-long trial is due to begin on May 9. But Coleen says she has no doubt the litigation will 'benefit neither Becky nor myself'. She continues: 'I should, however, highlight that those attempts to compromise this dispute were not made due to any concern with the underlying merits or an absence of confidence in my position. 'I was seeking to be pragmatic and to consider the bigger picture in order to enable both parties to move on with our respective lives -- essentially, an olive branch, if you will.' But she revealed the ordeal was 'messing with my head that someone I trusted was doing this'. Despite the pending hearing, though, Coleen condemned those sending Mrs Vardy 'abusive and threatening messages', slamming them as 'unacceptable'.",
  "f362fabc900e132ae3183bf311dfa913da56f0e6113637348e5b66bd": "Greggs bakery has recalled its popular two-pack chicken bake which might contain shards of plastic to choke people -- exactly a year after it had to issue a similar alert over bits of glass thought to be in its vegetable bakes. The 306g frozen packets of chicken bakes are exclusively sold in Iceland Foods stores, and have a best before date of September 19, 2022. The Food Standards Agency said Greggs had warned that the bakes 'may contain pieces of hard dark coloured plastic'. Iceland shoppers are being urged not to eat the product, and to return it to the store for a refund. The FSA added that the plastic made the bakes 'unsafe to eat'.  A notice from Greggs apologised for inconvenience caused to shoppers. 'This two-pack product is exclusive to Iceland and therefore the recall is only applicable to product purchased from Iceland Stores,' it said.   'No other products, date codes or batches are affected.' A spokesperson added: 'The safety of our food is of paramount importance and we take all issues regarding the production of our food extremely seriously.' In May last year, Greggs recalled PS2 vegetable bakes sold in Iceland over fears they could contain slivers of glass. The FSA said it involved 310g packs of two vegetable bakes with best before dates of 15 August 2021, 28 August 2021, 11 September 2021, 12 September 2021 and 26 September 2021. The frozen vegetable bakes were also exclusive to Iceland and it did not affect Greggs' own stores. The packs were withdrawn, and it was not clear how many packs had slipped through safety checks, or how suspected glass fragments ended up in the products. It was also not clear at what stage the glass could have got into the bakes, and why it was not spotted in the production process before being packed. In August 2020, the FSA reported that Greggs had urgently recalled two-pack frozen steak bakes because they might contain small bits of plastic. The 280g packs, with a best before date of December 20th, 22nd and 23rd 2020, were being sold exclusively in Iceland stores.

  "13c94733795dc1deee728f264cc67500d91b420357ddeaebdf1bc7c3": "Vladimir Putin has two secret sons by his gymnast 'lover' Alina Kabaeva, according to a new report today. The first boy was born in secrecy in Switzerland amid huge security in 2015, according to a source linked to the obstetrician who was at the birth. The second son was delivered in Moscow in 2019 with the same specialist flying to Russia for the birth, according to an investigation by Swiss broadsheet newspaper Sonntagszeitung. The Russian leader, who will be 70 this year, has since 2007 denied a relationship with Olympic gold-medal winning Kabaeva, now 38. He has hidden his alleged secret family from voters - and was not present at either of the births. The report confirms strong rumours over a Putin-Kabaeva family, except in suggesting there was one son born in 2019 rather than twins. It also indicates that Kabaeva is the secret Russian first lady at a time when the country is suffering major losses from the war with Ukraine. The source of the new report - published today - is said to be a personal friend of Kabaeva who also knows the obstetrician, an unnamed Soviet-born medic acquainted with Putin for more than three decades and a long-time Swiss citizen after emigrating from Russia. The paper reported: 'Our source says clearly: 'Alina's relationship with Putin existed. Their children - two sons - are Putin's children. Alina had no other relationship. That would have been too dangerous for her'.' The female doctor works at Clinica Sant'Anna in the Italian-speaking Ticino region of Switzerland where the first child was born. The obstetrician had 'maintained a trusting relationship with Putin', said the report. 'You had to keep the whole thing very discreet,' the newspaper was told. Contrary to gossip in 2015, Putin was not present at the birth which - at the time - the Kremlin denied. There was also only one Putin-Kabaeva child born in Switzerland, said the source. By the 'president's decision', the second son was born in Moscow. The same Russian emigre Swiss obstetrician delivered the second son in Moscow in 2019. Before the birth, Kabaeva had traveled in secret to Lugano several times. The source described Kabaeva as 'a very pleasant woman. 'She is a real sportswoman, very straight, without posturing. 'She came with her mother and sister, but without bodyguards.' Despite this, a blanket of secrecy was thrown over the births. Kabaeva had also travelled multiple times to Switzerland before starting her relationship with Putin, believed to be in 2007. She was an ambassador for Longines watches from 1999 to 2008. Recently, rumours suggested that she and her suspected young children were hiding out from the war at a reclusive Swiss chalet. However ten days ago - after a four-month absence from the limelight - she reappeared in Moscow. There are indications she has spent time near Geneva at the Cologny residence of Gennady Timchenko, 69, an oligarch very close to Putin. Timchenko's representatives refused to comment to the Sunday newspaper. Swiss government representatives say there is no indication Kabaeva has been in the country recently. A video shows Kabaeva in May 2015 - which at the time sparked rumours of pregnancy - at her annual gymnastics show for children called 'Alina 2015'. At the time she said: 'The children performed brilliantly.' Putin has two officially acknowledged children -- Maria, 37, and Katerina, 35, both from first wife Lyudmila. Dr Maria Vorontsova - a year younger than Kabaeva, who was born when the Russian president was a KGB spy in Germany - is an expert in rare genetic diseases in children. She is a leading researcher at the National Medical Research Center for Endocrinology of the Ministry of Health of Russia. Her divorced sister Katerina is deputy director of the Institute for Mathematical Research of Complex Systems at Moscow State University. She is a former high-kicking 'rock'n'roll' dancer. Both daughters have been sanctioned by the West, unlike Kabaeva, and Putin's unacknowledged 'love child' Luiza Rozova, 19. Luiza is the daughter of cleaner-turned-multimillionaire Svetlana Krivonogikh, 45, now part-owner of a major Russian bank, one of the country's wealthiest women with an estimated PS74 million financial and property fortune. Kabaeva used the build-up to last weekend's 'Alina 2022' show in Moscow to make her first appearance in public since the war started in Ukraine. This followed rumours she had been hiding in Switzerland - or in a hi-tech Siberian nuclear bunker. At the show itself she was filmed in front of the 'Z' symbols of Putin's troops, which critics have likened to a swastika symbol. She wore a PS1,915 from a British-based designer as she led a patriotic-themed gymnastics ballet in which she linked the defeat of Hitler's Nazis to the Russian fight against Ukraine. The event included some of the Soviet Union's most patriotic songs in a celebration of the country's victory over the Germans. The theme at her annual festival was unmistakably intended to boost patriotic support for Putin's military adventure in Ukraine. She wore a wedding ring and a fluid silk fuchsia midi dress from the new collection of London-based Alessandra Rich who has previously supplied David Cameron's wife Samantha - for a state occasion with President Barack Obama - and a host of A-listers. Russians were struck by Kabaeva's new look last weekend, sparking rumours of recent cosmetic surgery. Russian Cosmopolitan said 'something has really changed in Kabaeva's face', adding that 'the legendary athlete was noticeably prettier'. Avoiding linking her to Putin, it said of a woman widely believed to be Russia's unofficial first lady: 'Alina Kabaeva is one of the most mysterious and secretive women in our country. 'The gymnast almost never appears in public, does not [appear in] social networks, and it is not possible to accidentally see her on the street or in shopping centres.' Telegram channel Tol'ko Nikomu - also choosing its words carefully to avoid the Russian censor - hinted that she and Putin share the same plastic surgeon. 'A new rare appearance of Alina Kabaeva. This time she is dressed casually - and is again seen with a wedding ring. 'And yes, the handwriting of the family beautician is quite notable.' Jailed Putin foe Alexei Navalny has demanded sanctions against Kabaeva. He singled out Kabaeva's National Media Group arguing that it was likely owned by Putin - who will be 70 this year - personally. Her salary here has been estimated at almost PS8 million a year, compared with the average annual figure of PS5,600. Navalny posted from jail: 'I want to remind you that the National Media Group, which owns the lion's share of this apparatus of lies, undoubtedly belongs to Putin personally, and as such is even formally headed by Putin's mistress Alina Kabaeva.' He called her a Putin propagandist and said she should be treated as a 'war criminal'. Kabaeva has kept a low profile in the Ukraine war - but her media has been vocal in cheerleading for Putin. Soon after the war started, a petition called on the Swiss authorities to send her packing back to Russia. 'It's time you reunite Eva Braun with her Fuhrer', said the petition. Rumours first linked her romantically to Putin as long ago as 2008 when she was a pro-Kremlin MP. The newspaper printing the story was rapidly closed down. Putin - who in 2013 announced his divorce from wife Lyudmila, a former Aeroflot stewardess - has previously said: 'I have a private life in which I do not permit interference. It must be respected.' He deplored 'those who with their snotty noses and erotic fantasies prowl into others' lives'. Kabaeva is on record as saying she had met a man who 'I love very much', gushing: 'Sometimes you feel so happy that you even feel scared.' In 2001 Kabaeva was temporarily banned from competing in rhythmic gymnastics after failing a doping test. A year earlier she had won gold at the 2000 summer Olympics. Once regarded as Russia's most eligible woman, her only other suitor has been a married Georgian policeman, according to media reports. This relationship petered out in 2005 amid complaints of tabloid intrusion into her life. She once posed almost nude for Maxim and was described as 'full of sex' by a photographer. There have been many reports of her wearing a wedding ring, but no records of a marriage. She is reported to have a fleet of Maybach limousines at her disposal, and was seen surrounded by a squad of machine-gun toting security guards on visits to a Moscow cafe, likely indicating she qualifies for state-level security. Many Russians saw her as the reason for the breakup of Putin's marriage to ex-first lady Lyudmila, 63, mother of his two adult daughters. The dictator of neighbouring Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko hinted that Putin's divorce decision came about because Kabaeva 'put pressure on the president'.  By Kaya Terry  A brutal sect of feared Chechen soldiers executed 'heavily wounded' Russian troops in a 'field hospital' that was situated northwest of Bucha, eyewitnesses have claimed. The Kadyrovtsy, who have been used as a PR tool in Vladimir Putin's war, allegedly murdered their own comrades and 'operated a torture chamber' in a glass factory on Yablonska Street - confirming previous reports by Ukraine's ombudsman for human rights, Lyudmila Denisova. Artem Hurin, a member of the city council of the neighboring town of Irpin who also serves as a deputy commander in Ukraine's Territorial Defense Forces, was one of the first to visit Borodyanka, northwest of Bucha, after the Putin's soldiers retreated last month when Ukrainian forces recaptured the town on April 2. He said: 'They would bring heavily wounded Russian soldiers to a big hospital they had there, and those who were very heavily wounded, they would just shoot them. No one other than the Kadyrovtsy did this.'  Hurin recalled the litany of horrifying stories from residents who were tortured and raped by lawless Russian troops and saw evidence of 'executed civilians' who lay dead on the street, the Daily Beast reports.  According to residents of the town, the killer squad of Chechen fighters - known as Kadyrovtsy - had executed people as early as March 5.  The revelations came as Ukraine said the first group of civilians were safely evacuated from the steel plant in the besieged city of Mariupol on Saturday night. A Ukrainian fighter, who had sheltered in the network of underground rooms and tunnels located underneath the factory since mid-April, said a group of around 20 women and children had managed to get out - but a reported 1,000 people are currently still stuck underneath the plant. Sviatoslav Palamar, Azov regiment deputy commander, told Reuters: 'We are getting civilians out of the rubble with ropes - it's the elderly, women and children.' One woman recalled how she endured four days of torture by one Kadyrovtsy soldier and one Belarusian soldier before they brutally shot her husband in the head. Meanwhile, the Bucha Mayor, Anatoliy Fedoruk, claimed Chechen troops tied white bands around prisoners' arms who were captured, which were similar to those found on the bodies of executed civilians in the city. Opening up about civilians who attempted to leave their homes to get food and water, Hurin added: 'They didn't allow them to do anything. There they just killed people through binoculars for example. They just shot them.'  Many Chechen soldiers were fighting alongside the Russian military, which waged two wars against Chechnya - a Muslim republic in southern Russia - between 1994 and 2000.  As the towns around Kyiv which were recaptured by Ukrainian forces have revealed horrific atrocities, with the bodies of hundreds of dead civilians piled up after Putin withdrew his band of thugs. Russia has denied targeting civilians despite the many stories of gang rape, sexual abuse in front of children, torture and executions to emerge from the barbaric war. A United Nations mission to Bucha documented 'the unlawful killing, including by summary execution, of some 50 civilians there', the UN's Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said. Forensic tests carried out on civilian corpses dumped in mass graves in the Kyiv region show women were raped before being brutally killed. Dozens of autopsies have been carried out on mutilated corpses from Bucha, Irpin and Borodianka, with many showing signs of torture and multiple bullet holes in the back. Some have been so badly disfigured or even decapitated that investigators have been unable to identify them. Vladyslav Pirovskyi, a Ukrainian forensic doctor who carried out the autopsies, told The Guardian: 'We already have a few cases which suggest that these women had been raped before being shot to death.  'We can't give more details as my colleagues are still collecting the data and we still have hundreds of bodies to examine.' His team has been analysing 15 bodies a day, with most killed by automatic gunfire. He added: 'There are many burnt bodies, and heavily disfigured bodies that are just impossible to identify. 'The face could be smashed into pieces, you can't put it back together, sometimes there's no head at all.' The evidence has been passed on to the region's senior prosecutor, Oleh Tkalenko, for further investigations. This comes as a group of Chechen fighters were seen firing heavy machine guns towards residential buildings in Ukraine's besieged city of Mariupol, on a video released on TikTok last month. The footage, shared by Kremlin-allied Chechen warlord Ramzan Kadyrov, also showed the Chechen soldiers seemingly celebrating as the camera panned to show the hollowed-out shells of destroyed apartment blocks. The soldiers, dressed in camouflaged military gear, pumped their fists to the camera and could be heard shouting 'allahu akbar'. On his Telegram channel, Kadyrov claimed his fighters were clearing 'the territory of the Nazis' - parroting a line used by President Putin and his propaganda machine to justify the invasion of Ukraine. Mariupol has seen some of the most intense fighting since Putin ordered his armies into Ukraine on February 24. Russian forces have been shelling the city indiscriminately, razing large swathes of the city. Officials say at least 2,400 civilians have been killed in the southern port city, but it is feared that the true toll is much higher. One official said earlier this month that he feared as many as 20,000 people could have been killed. The Chechen military is known for its Hollywood-inspired videos claiming to show their soldiers in action, while actually showing them doing very little. Experts say the videos are just another branch of Putin's propaganda efforts.  Kadyrov's video also showed his soldiers climbing through the window of a building, seemingly to help a civilian out. However, while the soldiers were passing a mattress between then, the footage did not actually show anyone being carried. Instead, one grinning fighter wearing sunglasses panned his camera around to show the scene of devastation around him, in a style that - anywhere else in the world - could be mistaken with a selfie-video from an Instagram influencer. In a separate TikTok video released in March, Chechen special forces were filmed fighting house-to-house in besieged Mariupol while 'hundreds' of women and children remained trapped in the rubble of a city theatre destroyed by Russian invaders. The footage, said to have been released by pro-Putin Chechen warlord Ramzan Kadyrov, shows heavily armed fighters from the region pounding a high-rise building in the bombed-out city during a fierce gunfight with Ukrainian soldiers. The propaganda video then cuts before showing some of the Chechen fighters emerging from the building with children in their arms while supposedly 'liberating' civilians. The video emerged as hundreds of people were still feared trapped under the rubble of a theatre in the devastated city that has been obliterated by Russian forces who control the overwhelming majority of the city and are mostly focusing their airstrikes on the Soviet-era steel plant located close to the harbour, where a contingent of between 1,000-2000 Ukrainian soldiers are staging a desperate holdout alongside roughly 1,000 civilians. Chechen troops have been embedded in the National Guard of Russia and have been fighting in Ukraine since the start of the invasion.  One squad of Kadyrov's fighters was reportedly sent to try and assassinate Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky, but was destroyed by Ukraine's forces. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky switched into Russian in his nightly video address to urge Russian soldiers not to fight in Ukraine, saying even their generals expected that thousands of them would die. He said Russia has been recruiting new troops 'with little motivation and little combat experience' for the units that were gutted during the early weeks of the war so these units can be thrown back into battle. He said Russian commanders fully understand that thousands of them will die and thousands more will be wounded in the coming weeks. 'The Russian commanders are lying to their soldiers when they tell them they can expect to be held seriously responsible for refusing to fight and then also don't tell them, for example, that the Russian army is preparing additional refrigerator trucks for storing the bodies,' Mr Zelensky said late on Saturday. 'They don't tell them about the new losses the generals expect. Every Russian soldier can still save his own life. It's better for you to survive in Russia than to perish on our land.' It comes as Sweden said a Russian military plane violated Swedish airspace. The incident happened late on Friday in the Baltic Sea near the island of Bornholm. In a statement on Saturday, the Swedish Armed Forces said a Russian AN-30 propeller plane flew toward Swedish airspace and briefly entered it before leaving the area. The Swedish Air Force scrambled fighter jets which photographed the Russian plane. Swedish Defence Minister Peter Hultqvist told Swedish public radio that the violation was 'unacceptable' and 'unprofessional'. In a similar incident in early March four Russian warplanes violated Swedish airspace over the Baltic Sea. Sweden and neighbouring Finland are both considering Nato membership following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Moscow has warned that such a move would have consequences, without giving specifics. Meanwhile, Russia has been forced to merge and redeploy depleted and disparate units from failed advances in northeast Ukraine, a British military update said on Saturday. 'Shortcomings in Russian tactical coordination remain. A lack of unit-level skills and inconsistent air support have left Russia unable to fully leverage its combat mass, despite localised improvements,' the military tweeted. 'Russia hopes to rectify issues that have previously constrained its invasion by geographically concentrating combat power, shortening supply lines and simplifying command and control,' it said.",

Speaking at Batyr, a youth-focused mental health organisation in western Sydney, the couple were in a relaxed and lighthearted mood as Mr Morrison underscored his commitment to addressing the issue of online abuse. The two even cuddled up to each other when speaking about the importance of good mental health and listening to inspirational stories of young adults who've overcome trauma.  As part the pre-election promise, funding will be increased for schools to combat the problem, victim support services will get a boost and laws will be beefed up to laws to target harassment - with tech giants also warned to do their part. But the prime minster was later grilled about his support for Warringah candidate Katherine Deves, who has a long history of posting anti-transgender remarks on Twitter. 'Our kids should be able to learn, be entertained, or connect with their friends and family without facing abuse, humiliation or online predators,' he said on Sunday. 'The online world cannot be a cowards' cavern where the rules of the real world do not exist. 'Big tech and social media giants must be held to account. Our plan will force them to do more - they cannot create it, and wash their hands of all consequences of it.' He said the plan will 'help to prevent harm by raising awareness in every school' and by improving our support for those harmed online. 'We have achieved so much in the online world, but there is much more to be done, and only a Coalition government will stand up to big tech and social media giants,' he said. The upbeat mood at the campaign doorstop quickly changed when the prime minister was asked about his support for Katherine Deves, who he handpicked to win back the marginal Sydney seat of Warringah at the May 21 election. The controversial candidate has previously claimed on social media that 'half of all males with trans identities are sex offenders' and also described trans people as 'surgically mutilated'. Mr Morrison hoping to distance himself from the fallout noted that Ms Deves has since deleted the post and withdrawn the remarks. He also stressed that he in no way supported the comments.  The Coalition's proposed measures to tackle online abuse includes increased funding for schools to stamp out the problem, a boost in victim support services and tougher penalties for online trolls. Mr Morrison has also vowed regulate parental controls on smartphones to protect children, if tech companies refuse to introduce effective controls themselves.  However, earlier attempts to amend defamation laws at the federal level have so far proved unsuccessful.  - A $23 million eSafety Schools package to raise awareness of the eSafety Commissioner's support across every school in Australia, provide training programs for teachers, new and improved online safety resources for schools and enhance the Trusted eSafety Provider Program that connects schools with external online safety providers that meet high standards. - Ensuring smartphones and tablet devices have strong parental controls installed that are easier to find and activate (particularly when first setting up a device) and harder for kids to bypass, through a binding industry code under the Online Safety Act. If industry doesn't act within 12 months, we will regulate to force them. - $10 million for the eSafety Commissioner to further expand coordination with other regulatory and law enforcement agencies, ensuring victims 'tell-us-once' and are supported into the right service, so they spend more time recovering and less time in bureaucracy. - Legislating the Social Media (Anti-Trolling) laws to ensure social media companies are held accountable as publishers and Australians are given more power to deal with harmful defamatory comments from anonymous trolls. - Supporting online safety in multicultural Australia by earmarking $2 million under the Online Safety Grants for projects that support women and girls in CALD communities.

The CCTV footage was captured in Great Preston, located between Kippax, Swillington and Garforth, on Saturday afternoon.  The video shows the thieves pounce when the driver leaves his van at a junction to make a delivery to a property opposite.  In the footage, two men on a motorbike can be seen waiting for their opportunity to strike.  They approach the parked van and the motorbike driver jumps off, before entering the vehicle. The Amazon driver, realising what has happened, runs across the road screaming and chases after the van as it speeds away.   He then hails a passing BMW for help and a few moments later a West Yorkshire Police van arrives at the scene. According to neighbours, the driver claimed he was mugged for his keys when he left the van unattended.  In 2018, Amazon started putting fake packages in their delivery trucks to test the integrity of their drivers. The online store planted the dummy parcels at random in a ploy to catch delivery drivers that steal customer packages. The thief-detecting strategy was ordered from Amazon's headquarters in Seattle as a response to overwhelming reports of package thefts. Drivers are supposed to scan every package in their truck. The labels on the fake packages were intentionally rigged to bring up an error message when scanned.",
  "39bd67de44c5e2c0a786d6d5ffd50b982f6b03258fecf06334f916ea": "Thousands of delighted Britons have now arrived in sunny Ibiza to escape the 'mixed bag of spring weather' in the UK for the May Bank Holiday. The British tourists soaked up the sun on beaches, danced the night away in nightclubs and indulged in the odd glass of sangria.  The Spanish Mediterranean island, summer outpost for major European nightclubs, is preparing for the first summer season since the Covid-19 pandemic forced the island to close down.  Ibiza's opening parties, including Pacha, O Beach and Defected Ibiza, normally kick-off at the start of May, with the season lasting until September.  Meanwhile, Spanish officials have sparked outrage by enforcing a 'six drinks a day' rule for all-inclusive holidays and in resorts on islands including Ibiza and Majorca. The new law, which affects some hotels in the Balearic Islands, means that holidaymakers are forced to pay extra if they want more than three free alcoholic drinks per meal. Spanish officials first announced the new law in January but its has caught out hundreds of British holiday-makers who are now arriving in the islands.  Local authorities in Spain introduced the booze ban in January this year, which affects certain resort areas of the Balearic Islands, including Palma, Ibiza and Magaluf. The new law - which states 'alcoholic drinks will be limited to six per day' - is part of a package of measures designed to crack down on anti-social behaviour. These also believed to include bans on pub crawls, happy hours and two-for-one drinks offers, which are all being enforced by hefty fines. Holidaymakers writing on social media have reacted furiously to the new laws, which many feel have not been widely publicised. One Twitter user believed that inclusive holidays with booze limits should be marketed as 'half-board' - and called for hotel contracts where this wasn't clearly stated to be ripped up. He said: 'Brits will now be restricted to just six drinks a day, which can only be accessed alongside their lunch and dinner - offering them a mere three drinks per meal. '[That's] usually referred to as 'Half Board Plus'. It's time to cancel the hotel contracts for All Inclusive basis.' A spokesperson for the ABTA - The Travel Association said the rules have the potential to cause 'confusion' among holidaymakers. They said: 'ABTA strongly supports initiatives that improve the health and safety of holidaymakers, as well as the welfare of local communities. 'Some of the measures introduced by the Balearic Islands authorities to limit anti-social behaviour have potential to cause confusion for UK holidaymakers. 'We welcome the recent clarification from the authorities, including that the restrictions will only apply to certain limited areas in Mallorca and Ibiza rather than the whole of the Balearics as originally proposed. 'ABTA will continue to engage with the Balearic Islands Government, ABTA Members and other parties, to encourage clear communication and exchange of information, in order to ensure holidaymakers travelling to hotels in the designated areas enjoy a positive customer experience.' Travel operator Thomas Cook recently alerted their customers to the crack down on free booze through an email. They said: 'Please be advised that a decree has been issued by the Balearic Government on a new restriction for All Inclusive meal option. 'There is a maximum of six alcoholic drinks per person per day that can be served and these drinks will be provided only during lunch and dinner (three each). 'Please be aware that Magalluf, El Arenal, Playa de Palma in Mallorca and Sant Antoni in Ibiza, there is new restriction on All Inclusive.'",
  "7947f8e2cc227f1cd1dc27acb69067363a817b6287c23fd42492294e": "Comedian James Corden opened the 2022 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner with a sketch of him taking over the duties of Press Secretary Jen Psaki, which included a cameo from a reporter she regularly clashes with, Fox News' Peter Doocy. The Late Late Show host eagerly took to the podium to take questions from reporters following a briefing with Psaki and President Joe Biden, but the ill-prepared Corden was immediately flanked with complicated questions from reporters.  Among them was Doocy, who Biden was recorded calling a 'stupid son of a b****' in January, with Psaki echoing similar remarks earlier this month.  Despite the critical comments from them, Doocy played his part in Corden's sketch on Saturday, appearing straight-forward and no-nonsense as he took on the fumbling comedian.  Doocy asks the 'interim-press secretary', 'When the president says one thing, and White House staff say something else, who are we supposed to listen to? The president, or White House staff?' 'Well you know what, David,' Corden says, appearing fed up by the questions from all the reporters.  'That's not my name,' Doocy quickly replies. 'You say your name is not David. I say your name is David,' Corden snaps back.  'And I'm stood up here and you're sat down there - unless you wanna be sat at the back with whoever they are' Corden added as he threatened to move Doocy to the far-end of the press room.  Corden's sketch also involved digs at the Biden administration as Psaki told him that the CDC is 'good,' to which he replies, 'Really? 'They've been pissing me off.' Psaki also tells him that the economy is strong, with Corden again questioning the validity of the statement.  'Is it,' he asks doubtfully as Psaki moves on to the rest of the briefing.  Also at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, comedian Trevor Noah mocked the Biden administration for rising inflation rates and took jabs at Florida Governor Ron DeSantis' possible presidential candidacy after the state banned dozens of math books earlier this month. The Daily Show Host touted Biden for coming out to the event on Saturday, saying he doesn't know why the president would miss a chance to hear all about his supposed accomplishments. 'You know, I think ever since you've come into office, things are really looking up. Gas is up. Rent is up. Food is up. Everything,' Noah joked about inflation, which is at the highest it's been in 40 years. Noah also took aim at Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump , and used the former Republican president as a gateway to roast DeSantis. '[If] Trump was the original Terminator, DeSantis is like the T-1000,' Noah said of the Florida governor. 'You're smarter than him, you're slicker than him, you can walk down ramps. 'Because you see, Trump said he won the election, but everyone was just able to look at the numbers and see he was wrong.  'That's why Ron DeSantis is one step ahead,' Noah said, referencing the fact that Florida tossed out 41 percent of the 132 math textbooks submitted for the next school year, more than half of which the state said referenced Critical Race Theory (CRT), with the rest containing Common Core and Social Emotional Learning (SEL). 'First you ban the math textbooks, then nobody knows how to count the votes,' Noah quipped. 'Boom, my man!' Saturday night's event - attended by reality TV star Kim Kardashian and her boyfriend, Pete Davidson, and other big stars including Drew Barrymore, Martha Stewart, Chris Tucker and Academy Award-winning actor Michael Keaton - also saw President Biden poke fun at his own low approval rating and call the Trump administration a 'horrible plague' as he cracked jokes and roasted the press. 'Tonight, we come here to answer a very important question in everybody's mind. Why in hell are we still doing this?' Biden quipped as he took the stage in the room full of journalists and D.C. insiders. 'I know there are questions about whether we should gather here tonight because of COVID. Well, we're here to show the country that we're getting through this pandemic. Plus, everyone had to prove they're fully vaccinated and boosted,' he said. 'Just contact your favorite Fox News reporter they're all here vaccinated and boosted.' He then addressed his historically low poll numbers for the first time, claiming that journalists were the only people who were less well-liked. 'I'm really excited to be here tonight with the only group of Americans have a lower approval rating than I have,' Biden said.          The moment involving Corden and Doocy served as light-hearted humor in what has been an otherwise tense situation between Psaki and Doocy in the past weeks. Psaki was in a live taping of the Pod Save America podcast on April 14 when she was recorded crticitizing Doocy and Fox News, saying: 'He works for a network that provides people with questions that, nothing personal to any individual including Peter Doocy, but might make anyone sound like a stupid son of a b***h.'  The Press Secretary has since stressed that she was not deliberately attempting to insult the Fox News White House correspondent, but instead criticizing the news outlet.  Following the insult, Psaki tweeted: 'Full video shows I also told a story about Peter's grace last night and made very clear I was not being critical of him or any reporter at Fox, and instead was critical of the slant of some Fox topics.  'He is doing his job. I am doing mine. We debate. We disagree. I respect that.' President Joe Biden earlier this year was caught on a hot mic calling Doocy a 'stupid son of a b***h' after the reporter asked Biden if inflation was a political liability for him. Psaki has said Biden called Doocy afterwards to apologize.  Despite the insults from the president and press secretary, Doocy has remained composed and said he would just like to move forward after he accepted Bidens' apology.  Speaking to Fox News' host Sean Hannity following the incident, Doocy noted that he didn't hear Biden's insult at first. 'My reaction was delayed because as you can see the Biden staff were ushering us out. 'They were telling us thank you, time to go. It wasn't until we went to the basement and then outside and then back to the press room that somebody said 'Hey, did you hear with the president said about you?' 'I said, 'No, what did he say?' 'He called you a stupid SOB,'' Doocy recalled. 'And I said 'I did not hear that,' and I opened up my phone and... he did!' Doocy said his cell phone rang with the president on the other line an hour later. 'After years of clips of the president and I kind of mixing it up on the campaign trail and during the transition here at the White House, within about an hour of that exchange, he called my cell phone and he just said 'It is nothing personal, pal.' 'And we went back and forth and we were talking about moving forward and I made sure to tell him that I'm always going to try to ask something different than what everybody else is asking. 'And he said, 'You've got to.' And that is the quote from the president, so I will keep doing it,' he told Hannity. Hannity asked Doocy if the president apologized. 'He cleared the air. And I appreciate it. We had a nice call,' Doocy replied. Fox has defended their White House correspondent, and denied suggestions that he was told what to ask. 'In his role as White House correspondent, Peter Doocy's job is to elicit truth from power for the American public,' a spokesperson said. 'His questions are his own, he is a terrific reporter and we are extremely proud of his work.' Fox News Channel's John Roberts, a former White House correspondent, criticized Psaki on Twitter saying: 'Note to Press Sec: Peter Doocy makes the decisions on what topics he wants to quiz you on, and develops the questions himself. His philosophy is a basic tenet of journalism. Comfort the afflicted, and afflict the comfortable.' 'If that makes all of us 'stupid s.o.b.s', so be it,' Roberts added.",

In what will probably go down in political history as one of the most bizarre ever incidents at a Liberal Party launch, one of Mr Frydenberg's supporters entertained the attendees with scarily accurate bird impressions.  And then Mr Frydenberg revealed the mother-in-law of his independent rival Monique Ryan told him she'll be voting for him. But when you are running as the underdog, as the Treasurer claims he is, then every bit of publicity helps.   The Kooyong launch was treated to an impression of a kookaburra by Phil Elwood, the bird man of the Liberal Party. He followed that fine impression with one of a sulphur-crested cockatoo.  Mr Elwood, who is a volunteer on Mr Frydenberg's campaign is confident of success. 'I know the Liberals will win because of Josh,' he said.   They met 10 years ago, when Mr Frydenberg dropped off Christmas hampers at Servants Community Housing in Kew where Mr Elwood was living.  He reportedly had a difficult life when he was younger, but has turned his life around.  In the other surprising moment of Mr Frydenberg's launch, he revealed that he has an unexpected vote in the bag.  'A very nice lady, in her 70s I think, came up to me and said 'Josh, I'm voting for you.' 'I said, 'That's very nice'. And she goes 'I'm Monique Ryan's mother-in-law',' he said to loud laughter from the Liberal faithful.   With polling showing he is in danger of losing his seat to Ms Ryan, he will need every vote he can get.  Asked if he is feeling desperate with pressure from Ms Ryan, the Treasurer said 'I think what we've seen today how much community support I have. Genuine community support.' A sign of Mr Frydenberg's concern about losing a seat that has always been held by political conservatives is that he said on Sunday he is 'not up against a true independent. I'm up against a political party.' Ms Ryan's campaign is well funded and was initially outspending Mr Frydenberg on social media advertising.  But the Treasurer has since raised more money and has now shelled out more than $1million on advertising - twice the amount Ms Ryan has spent. Mr Frydenberg warned in his campaign launch that 'a hung parliament will bring chaos and confusion' and voters should stick to what they know. 'I said this is the fight of my political life, and it is.' ",

The attack unfolded in the third-floor game room around 10.40pm on Saturday when one person pulled a knife on the other. The suspect fled the restaurant after the attack but was arrested a short time later, reports the New York Post.  The victim was rushed to St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital where they were pronounced dead.  The motive for the crime has not been made public nor is it clear if the two people involved in the stabbing knew each other.  DailyMail.com has reached out to Dave & Busters for comment on the incident.  According to the New York Police Department, the city has seen a more than 40 percent rise in major crimes in the past month, compared to the same period in 2021.  In January 2022, New York City Mayor Eric Adams unveiled a comprehensive plan to combat surge in crime. That included increased foot patrols as well as the revival of a plain clothes unit named Neighborhood Safety Teams.  The Dave and Busters stabbing is the second stabbing to occur in Times Square in less than 24 hours. In the early hours of April 30 a man was stabbed at a hot dog stand in the area. His condition was unknown.  In May 2021, a man was mugged also on the third floor of the restaurant at 6 p.m., reported the New York Post at the time.  On the day of the Dave & Busters stabbing, Mayor Eric Adams spoke about efforts to to reduce crime, saying: 'We also want to raise the expectations of our schools, of our [Human Resources Administration], of our Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. We constantly have the police officers under scrutiny. It's time for everybody to be under scrutiny.' ",

Party chairman Oliver Dowden this morning reiterated a commitment from Boris Johnson to ensure half of Conservative candidates for the Commons are women. It came as the Conservatives found themselves under huge pressure to act in the wake of Neil Parish's Commons' porn shame. The Tiverton and Honiton MP has said he will quit politics after admitting he was the Conservative seen by disgusted female colleagues watching porn on his phone while sitting on the green benches.  It has give rise to further claims of laddish and debauched behaviour by MPs in Westminster. In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Dowden said the Tories need to ensure their candidate lists 'reflects the fact that half the population are women'. 'We will be launching the road to the next general election and part of that is getting the best-quality members of Parliament,' he told the Telegraph.  'I've reopened the candidates list and I want to get the brightest and the best.' Around a quarter of Conservative candidates at the 2019 election were women, but Labour managed to ensure women represented more than half of its candidates. And earlier this week, Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries suggested ensuring 'a majority of women' in Parliament could help tackle Westminster sleaze. But Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng today spoke out against all-women shortlists being used.  He told Sky News the party needed a lot more more female MPs 'as we should have more people from a wider range of backgrounds'. But asked if he would support all-female lists he said: 'I've never been a fan, frankly, personally, of quotas and shortlists. 'I've never really advocated that but obviously we should do all we can to see how we can get more women and more people from diverse backgrounds into politics.' MPs are facing increasing pressure to clean up Westminster politics amid a wave of sordid claims about booze-fuelled behavior that has left Parliament's reputation in the gutter. An extra-ordinary rap sheet of sexist and misogynistic behaviour has been revealed in the wake of Neil Parish's resignation for watching pornography while sat in the Commons. Among then are a minister accused of having 'noisy sex' in his parliamentary office, a Tory MP who sent a 'd**k pic' to a female colleague and another who has been given repeated warnings for his use of prostitutes. Another MP is also said to have drunkenly licked men's faces which cavorting in one of Parliament's many bars. The Sunday Times alleged today one MP got so drunk on champagne at a posh parliamentary bash they had to be escorted out, while in a separate incident a female researcher got so drunk she vomited in a Commons' bar and was later found passed out.  The new claims come after previous allegations of boorish and misogynistic behaviour by male politicians, including likening female MPs to sex workers because of the way they are dressed.  Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle today called for 'radical' reform to working practices, including ending the direct employment of aides by MPs, to make it easier for them to make complaints without fear of losing their jobs. His bid for change was echoed by Andrea Leadsom, the former leader of the Commons, who in 2018 spearheaded the creation of the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS), which looks into claims of bullying and sexual harassment. She told The Sunday Times: 'Things haven't changed and that's because there aren't enough cases coming through and it's taking too long for investigations to come to an end. 'It's only when you see people getting done for being blind drunk and subject to the appropriate sanctions that people will start to think twice about their behaviour.'",
  "f0d18f196cd076798dba296022608f052deef83500342790e65a1098": "A Disney historian has come forward to dismiss the idea that the famous family are united against Florida's controversial 'Don't Say Gay' bill.  Historian Jim Korkis described the family, which still owns a 3 percent stake in the company, as 'very conservative' and 'private,' in an interview with the New York Post.  This comes as the Disney corporation clashes with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis over the bill that is officially known as Parental Rights in Education. The bill, which will become law from July 1, bans formal lessons on gender identity for children from kindergarten through to third grade.  When the bill first passed in March 2022, Disney CEO Bob Chapek was initially silent. But, days later, the company public said it opposed the bill following internal pressure from workers and the public.  Some members of the Disney family, like Abigail Disney and her brother Roy P. Disney - whose stepdaughter is transgender - have been openly critical of the bill, but their views don't appear to be mirrored by some family members.  'In general, the whole family is very conservative and they keep to themselves Korkis told The Post. 'They have always been extremely private. The family is not unified whatsoever.'  According to Roy P. Disney, Walt Disney's grand nephew, the family still owns around three percent of the company.  In 2021, the Disney corporation raked in nearly $22 billion in revenue.  Although the family has no control of the company's decisions, Korkis told the Post that it was Walt Disney's goal to keep his family away from running the business.  Roy P. Disney said in April 2022 that his stepdaughter Charlee Corra is transgender. He said that he is 'heartbroken' by the 'Don't Say Gay' bill.  Laws similar to the one in Florida are also being considered in Alabama, Ohio, Louisiana, Texas, Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Kentucky, and Tennessee.   Roy and his wife Sheri announced that they would match donations Disney made to the Republican Party to the Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBTQ advocacy group in the country, up to $500,000. 'Equality matters deeply to us, especially because our child, Charlee, is transgender and a proud member of the LGBTQ+ community,' he wrote in a statement. Charlee told The Los Angeles Times, said that they were dismayed at Florida governor Ron DeSantis's signing of the controversial 'Don't Say Gay' bill, which forbids the discussion of homosexuality or transgender issues in classrooms for children through third grade. Charlee said that they were dismayed at the bill, signed into law on March 28, and wished they had done more at the time to campaign against it. 'I feel like I don't do very much to help,' Charlee said. 'I don't call senators or take action. I felt like I could be doing more.' Charlee said the new bill would isolate young people and make them feel uncomfortable in their own skin. 'I had very few openly gay role models,' said Charlee, whose mother remembers Charlee aged two or three tugging her away from the little girls' shoe section, saying: 'But mom, I'm a boy on the inside.' Charlee added: 'And I certainly didn't have any trans or nonbinary role models. 'I didn't see myself reflected in anyone, and that made me feel like there was something wrong with me.' The most outspoken member of the family has been Roy O. Disney, Walt Disney's brother's granddaughter, Abigail Disney, 62. Abigail Disney has even gone so far as to criticize her family's business practices and their treatment of staff. At one point, she labelled Walt Disney as a racist anti-semite.  Last month, she responded to criticism of the family firm for its move to be more inclusive and create more LGBTQ characters. She said the attacks from right-wing critics were 'absurd'. 'There have been gay people whether or not the word was ever spoken,' she told CNN. 'It denies the fact that everyone, conservative or not, has a gay friend or a transgender family member.' She publicly celebrated her brother's decision to publicly speak about Charlee, posting on Twitter:  'Today I am busting with pride at what my brother and his wife have done. So proud so proud so proud!!!' she said.  Korkis told the Post that Abigail Disney is the 'wildcard' of the family.  He went on to say that due to their wealth, members of the Disney do whatever they want in life.  Roy O. Disney, who died in 1971, and Walt Disney, who died in 1966, were both conservatives but had some liberal tendencies, Korkis said.  According to Korkis, both were concerned with environmental issues and both believed hiring women to work at Disney.   HB 1557 was introduced by two Republican members of the Florida Legislature - Representative Joe Harding and Senator Dennis Baxley. They say the bill's aim is to 'empower parents' in their children's education, and make teachers recognize the distinction between 'instruction' and 'discussion.' 'What we're prohibiting is instructing them in a specific direction,' Baxley said about how teachers lead students in a classroom.  'Students can talk about whatever they want to bring up, but sometimes the right answer is, ''You really ought to talk to your parents about that.''' The bill applies to children in kindergarten through third grade. It states that 'classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur.' It also requires districts to 'adopt procedures for notifying a student's parent if there is a change in the student's services or monitoring related to the student's mental, emotional, or physical health or well-being,' something LGBTQ advocates argue could lead to students being outed to their parents without the student's knowledge or consent. It was passed on March 8 in a 22-17 vote. The state House had approved the bill late last month. DeSantis signed it into law on March 28 and it will come into effect on July 1. In April, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he would strip Disney of its Reedy Creek Improvement District, which has been in place for 55 years and allows the company to govern itself.   'Disney has alienated a lot of people now,' DeSantis said on April 1. 'And so the political influence they're used to wielding, I think has dissipated. 'And so the question is, why would you want to have special privileges in the law at all? And I don't think that we should.' Abigail Disney said DeSantis, considered a likely Republican contender for the presidency in 2024, was playing a strategic game to win over conservatives. 'This attack against Disney was so timed and rolled out so strategically that it was really hard for me to imagine that it didn't come from a series of decisions that got made in the background,' Abigail Disney said. She said the company's CEO Bob Chapek, who has been criticized for wavering in his support for protests against the bill, needed to be courageous and take a hard stance. 'You can't claim neutrality if you're supporting the people who write these laws,' Disney said. 'But on top of it, there is no neutrality anymore.' Disney employs around 60,000 people.  On Friday, it was reported that Geoff Morrell, the company's head of communications who helped to construct Disney's response to the Florida bill, was to leave his job after just three months in the role.  Morrell initially advised Chapek to remain silent on the bill out of fear that it would make Disney a punching bag for Republican figures DeSantis and Donald Trump reports CNBC.  He will be replaced in the role by Kristina Schake.   Following Disney's decision to oppose the bill, DeSantis retaliated by beginning efforts to strip Disney of its privileges in Florida where one of the the company's theme parks is located. The company has donated to both Republican and Democratic candidates over the years, Korkis said. He added, 'It's quite a slap in the face that the Republicans have declared war on Disney.'",
  "e9762e0cf9ec1c2bb3bc256eebf5cadca0097094294fba8bba20a280": "Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates has warned there is a 'way above five per cent' risk the world has not yet seen the worst of the Covid pandemic. The tech mogul and philanthropist said he did not want to sound 'doom and gloom' but warned there was a risk an 'even more transmissive and even more fatal' variant could be generated. He said the risk of that happening is 'way above five per cent' and would mean the world has yet to see the worst of the pandemic. It is not the first time he has made such a prediction. In December 2021, he warned his millions of Twitter followers to brace themselves for the worst part of the pandemic having previously cautioned in 2015 that the world was not ready for the next pandemic. Gates told the FT: 'We're still at risk of this pandemic generating a variant that would be even more transmissive and even more fatal. 'It's not likely, I don't want to be a voice of doom and gloom, but it's way above a 5 per cent risk that this pandemic, we haven't even seen the worst of it.'  Covid-19 has killed an estimated 6.2million people worldwide since March 2020, but case numbers and deaths have been dropping in recent weeks. Gates' warning comes after Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organisation (WHO), this week warned that people still needed to be wary of the virus, and that decreases in overall testing and Covid surveillance in many countries left the world at risk to a resurgence of the virus.  Gates - who releases his new book How to Prevent the Next Pandemic on Tuesday - advised governments across the world to invest in a team of epidemiologists and computer modellers to help identify global health threats in the future. He called his plan the Global Epidemic Response and Mobilization initiative and said it should be managed by the WHO - the only body he claimed was capable to build and manage the 'top-notch' team of experts at a cost of around $1bn a year. He said the WHO's current funding model was 'not at all serious about pandemics' and that less than ten people had been working full time on outbreak preparedness while also being distracted with other activities.  Gates' comments come at the end of a week when daily Covid hospitalisations in the UK hit a two-month low and deaths plunged 40 per cent in a week. Government dashboard data -- which is becoming increasingly unreliable now that free testing has been scrapped -- showed there were 1,186 admissions for the virus across the UK on April 23.  It marked a near-18 per cent decrease on the previous week and a 36 per cent fall in a fortnight. It was also the lowest number since February 27, when there were 1,101 admissions.  Separate NHS figures show more than half of patients with Covid in hospitals are not primarily sick with the virus, in another promising sign.  Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests 2.4million people in England were infected with the virus any day last week, equivalent to one in 25 people -- down by a quarter on the previous week. The huge surveillance study, based on swabs of 120,000 people and considered the best way of measuring the nation's outbreak, logged its lowest figure since the week beginning February 26.  The drop-off comes just weeks after NHS leaders called for face masks and outdoor mixing to return to cut Covid rates and take pressure off the health service. ",
  "0f129f17e2a62684fa5c463c7c14e6d1f581aa2d0d9599c432c3675e": "A Singaporean dancer will portray the Queen in the Platinum Jubilee pageant later this year, in a move to represent the head of the Commonwealth as a global icon. Janice Ho, 22, a third-year student at the London Contemporary Dance School, will open the 'Let's Celebrate' part of the pageant, playing the young Princess Elizabeth before she became Queen.  The dance, titled, Princess and the Dragon, will include a 14ft tall dragon puppet to symbolise the princess recognising her imminent power and responsibility.  Trigger, the arts group that created Ms Ho's act, had hoped its 'Bridgerton casting' would result in a woman of colour taking on the part.  The Netflix Regency drama has been praised for it's diverse actors, including Simone Ashley, who takes the leading role of Kate Sharma in its recently released second series. The pageant will be Ms Ho's first professional role, having been cast from open auditions. 'I'm really excited to be able to perform to such a big crowd in countries across he Commonwealth,' she told The Sunday Telegraph. 'London is such a diverse place and being able to represent that is such a great opportunity.'  Ms Ho said that it is 'very important' to her that actors from the 'global majority' can showcase their talents, and said she was pleased by Bridgerton's casting.  She hopes to bring a 'sense of light-heartedness' to her depiction of the princess, before she faces 'the reality' of becoming Queen.  Angie Bual, artistic director of Trigger, said that it was Ms Ho's 'dynamic' auditions that landed her the part, and that she did not want to cast a Queen Elizabeth look-alike. 'She is a woman of colour and that is something we strongly stand by,' she told the paper. Ms Bual said that Bridgerton's casting is a 'great example of how we can loosen up our unconscious bias and shake up who we usually see as role models'.  'The Queen is such a role mode, obviously in this country and internationally, and I think we need to role model all types of diversity,' she added. 'It is a reflection of the make-up of Britain and London today.' There will be many other 'carnival queens' in this section, including a royal wedding reimagined in Bollywood style, a drag queen by the name of Cheddar Gorgeous, and 'Gangsta Grannies' -- with the oldest cast member in her 90s. The aim is that the performance will be 'relevant to our times', and reflect the 'diverse voices of our country', celebrating multicultural Great Britain in a similar way to the 2012 London Olympics Opening Ceremony. Ms Ho is the only dancer who will represent Queen Elizabeth, with the remaining roles based on queens from all aspects of life, but taking inspiration from the monarch's 70-year reign.  Alongside the dragon, there will be other gigantic puppets, including one of Her Majesty walking her pet corgis, and a bust with a coronation robe made-up of dancers.  The entire pageant, broken down into four parts, features more than 100 'national treasures'. It will travel down The Mall to an expected crowd of 10,000, with a grand finale outside Buckingham Palace.  ",
  "2ad0923990ec15665a7a00892b47a7acd53f9012d8d11c07a335f8ce": "Locals who raised PS30,000 in a desperate bid to save the last remaining pub in their village from closure have celebrated inside as it reopened for the first time over the bank holiday weekend. The White Lion pub in Broadwindsor, Dorset, had been under threat of shutting down after its landlord said last year that they would not be reopening after lockdown. It would have become the fifth and final pub in the village to close after The Cross Keys, The Oak, The Butchers Arms and The George Inn all ceased trading and were redeveloped for residential use. But determined villagers set out to rescue the 17th century pub, situated in the centre of the ancient parish, after its owners approached the parish council to see if there was interest in running the pub as a community enterprise. After a majority of villagers said they wanted to save the local, residents were able to raise PS32,000 in just two weeks. And following two months of refurbishment works, The White Lion reopened as a community pub on Friday with around 100 locals showing their support. Overall, the group has raised nearly PS60,000, around PS45,000 of which has come through community donations, and the rest via contributions from several parish council grants and Power to Change and Pub is the Hub campaigns. The money has been used to renovate the bar area and provide working capital. It will also be used to provide essential kitchen equipment so the pub can serve food again in the near future. David Leader, who spearheaded the campaign, sadly died last month prior to the pub's opening aged 64. Rick Dyke, chairman of the White Lion Management Committee, paid tribute to his 'amazing character' and said the pub will have tributes to David in the future. He added : 'Without David's energy, enthusiasm and diplomacy, we would not be reopening the pub. We hope that The White Lion will become the community hub that David envisaged. 'We are incredibly excited to be opening but it is bittersweet with the loss of David. He was an amazing character who put his time and energy into so many different things in the community. 'We are hoping to have some small tributes to David in the pub in the future. 'I'd also like to thank the many volunteers who have so freely given their time to help with the refurbishment, some of whom have been almost living in the pub in recent months. 'I am sure everyone who visits The White Lion will agree that the transformation has been remarkable. 'We will have three paid members of staff and will get others when the need arises, as well as support from volunteers on an occasional basis. 'Tuesday there is a fish and chip van that comes to the village so we won't serve food on Tuesdays but will encourage people to bring their fish and chips to the pub and the bar will be staffed by volunteers that night. 'We have an open fire and The Log Company, a local business, have also supplied us with a big sack of logs for our opening weekend. It all shows there is a desire within the community to make this a success.' The White Lion aims to be modestly profitable, but not for profit, offering food and drink with an emphasis on local produce. The atmosphere is intended to be warm and friendly and a hub for the community. It will be open from Tuesday to Sunday, with longer hours at the weekend, and will be run by Kate Staff - whose parents live locally along with her two daughters Chloe and Louise. Broadwindsor has a population of around 1,500 people, including the surrounding hamlets. The rescue project comes after residents there have already saved the village shop from closing after taking that over as a community project that now turns over PS250,000 a year. The community group will have to pay owners Palmers Brewery a monthly rent based on a percentage of their turnover.",
  "e40574c02a50fb0c712bbc0e6440a67d516d1c97bf59c3a880166839": "60 Minutes reporter Tom Steinfort attempted to give Volodymyr Zelensky a packet of Tim Tams and bottle of red wine before the gifts were confiscated. Steinfort wanted to give the iconic chocolate biscuits and Penfolds wine to the Ukrainian president after he agreed to an interview with the Nine Network. The veteran reporter flew with his production team to the Ukraine and awaited further instructions on where to meet Zelensky for the sit-down. Steinfort received a text message at 10.39pm informing him of the location before he went to the undisclosed bunker in Kyiv with his gifts in hand. Ukrainian soldiers stopped Steinfort at the door before confiscating the items, he wrote for the Sydney Morning Herald. 'We need to send these away for testing before giving them to the president, we can't risk radiation poisoning,' the soldiers told Steinfort. Steinfort said his production team had to pass through several roadblocks being patrolled by armed troops, follow soldiers down a concealed alleyway and go through an x-ray machine before meeting Zelensky. 'There, we have to put all of our equipment through x-ray machines, go through more passport checks, and are then handed to the dog squad who sniff our belongings for explosives,' he wrote. The production team were led to the same room where Zelensky had met with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken for face-to-face talks days earlier.  Steinfort said Zelensky pulled him to the side to chat with him briefly before the cameras recorded the interview. The Ukrainian president had nothing but praise for Australia.  'Before our cameras roll, he wants to tell me about how much he loves Australia - volunteering a story about when he visited Sydney many years ago, and got lost on a morning run,' Steinfort wrote. 'He says he was struck by how many complete strangers offered to help this random Ukrainian find his way back to his hotel.'  The 60 Minutes segment will air on Channel Nine on Sunday.  Prime Minister Scott Morrison says there is no rush to deal with the issue of Russian President Vladimir Putin attending the next G20 leaders' summit. Mr Putin and Zelensky have agreed to attend the G20 summit to be held in Bali in November. Russia is a member while Mr Zelensky would attend as an invited observer. G20 host leader and Indonesian President Joko Widodo has spoken with Mr Zelensky and Mr Putin, urging them to end the war and offering to play a role in peace negotiations. Indonesia has rejected the Ukrainian leader's request for arms on constitutional and foreign policy grounds, but instead will send humanitarian aid. Mr Morrison told reporters in Sydney on Sunday the issue of Mr Putin's attendance 'still has some distance to travel'. He said Australia would consult with other like-minded countries, but the key was to ensure the Indonesian summit was successful. 'We don't know what the situation (in Ukraine) will be in November of this year,' Mr Morrison said.",
  "5b925f8c3b3eed5464012ea35810d3fdbbc690c17bae2ff837ee4b9c": "A brutal sect of feared Chechen soldiers executed 'heavily wounded' Russian troops in a 'field hospital' that was situated northwest of Bucha, eyewitnesses have claimed. The Kadyrovtsy, who have been used as a PR tool in Vladimir Putin's war, allegedly murdered their own comrades and 'operated a torture chamber' in a glass factory on Yablonska Street - confirming previous reports by Ukraine's ombudsman for human rights, Lyudmila Denisova. Artem Hurin, a member of the city council of the neighboring town of Irpin who also serves as a deputy commander in Ukraine's Territorial Defense Forces, was one of the first to visit Borodyanka, northwest of Bucha, after the Putin's soldiers retreated last month when Ukrainian forces recaptured the town on April 2. He said: 'They would bring heavily wounded Russian soldiers to a big hospital they had there, and those who were very heavily wounded, they would just shoot them. No one other than the Kadyrovtsy did this.'  Hurin recalled the litany of horrifying stories from residents who were tortured and raped by lawless Russian troops and saw evidence of 'executed civilians' who lay dead on the street, the Daily Beast reports.  According to residents of the town, the killer squad of Chechen fighters - known as Kadyrovtsy - had executed people as early as March 5.  The revelations came as Ukraine said the first group of civilians were safely evacuated from the steel plant in the besieged city of Mariupol on Saturday night. A Ukrainian fighter, who had sheltered in the network of underground rooms and tunnels located underneath the factory since mid-April, said a group of around 20 women and children had managed to get out - but a reported 1,000 people are currently still stuck underneath the plant. Sviatoslav Palamar, Azov regiment deputy commander, told Reuters: 'We are getting civilians out of the rubble with ropes - it's the elderly, women and children.' One woman recalled how she endured four days of torture by one Kadyrovtsy soldier and one Belarusian soldier before they brutally shot her husband in the head. Meanwhile, the Bucha Mayor, Anatoliy Fedoruk, claimed Chechen troops tied white bands around prisoners' arms who were captured, which were similar to those found on the bodies of executed civilians in the city. Opening up about civilians who attempted to leave their homes to get food and water, Hurin added: 'They didn't allow them to do anything. There they just killed people through binoculars for example. They just shot them.'  Many Chechen soldiers were fighting alongside the Russian military, which waged two wars against Chechnya - a Muslim republic in southern Russia - between 1994 and 2000.  As the towns around Kyiv which were recaptured by Ukrainian forces have revealed horrific atrocities, with the bodies of hundreds of dead civilians piled up after Putin withdrew his band of thugs. Russia has denied targeting civilians despite the many stories of gang rape, sexual abuse in front of children, torture and executions to emerge from the barbaric war. A United Nations mission to Bucha documented 'the unlawful killing, including by summary execution, of some 50 civilians there', the UN's Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said. Forensic tests carried out on civilian corpses dumped in mass graves in the Kyiv region show women were raped before being brutally killed. Dozens of autopsies have been carried out on mutilated corpses from Bucha, Irpin and Borodianka, with many showing signs of torture and multiple bullet holes in the back. Some have been so badly disfigured or even decapitated that investigators have been unable to identify them. Vladyslav Pirovskyi, a Ukrainian forensic doctor who carried out the autopsies, told The Guardian: 'We already have a few cases which suggest that these women had been raped before being shot to death.  'We can't give more details as my colleagues are still collecting the data and we still have hundreds of bodies to examine.' His team has been analysing 15 bodies a day, with most killed by automatic gunfire. He added: 'There are many burnt bodies, and heavily disfigured bodies that are just impossible to identify. 'The face could be smashed into pieces, you can't put it back together, sometimes there's no head at all.' The evidence has been passed on to the region's senior prosecutor, Oleh Tkalenko, for further investigations. This comes as a group of Chechen fighters were seen firing heavy machine guns towards residential buildings in Ukraine's besieged city of Mariupol, on a video released on TikTok last month. The footage, shared by Kremlin-allied Chechen warlord Ramzan Kadyrov, also showed the Chechen soldiers seemingly celebrating as the camera panned to show the hollowed-out shells of destroyed apartment blocks. The soldiers, dressed in camouflaged military gear, pumped their fists to the camera and could be heard shouting 'allahu akbar'. On his Telegram channel, Kadyrov claimed his fighters were clearing 'the territory of the Nazis' - parroting a line used by President Putin and his propaganda machine to justify the invasion of Ukraine. Mariupol has seen some of the most intense fighting since Putin ordered his armies into Ukraine on February 24. Russian forces have been shelling the city indiscriminately, razing large swathes of the city. Officials say at least 2,400 civilians have been killed in the southern port city, but it is feared that the true toll is much higher. One official said earlier this month that he feared as many as 20,000 people could have been killed. The Chechen military is known for its Hollywood-inspired videos claiming to show their soldiers in action, while actually showing them doing very little. Experts say the videos are just another branch of Putin's propaganda efforts.  Kadyrov's video also showed his soldiers climbing through the window of a building, seemingly to help a civilian out. However, while the soldiers were passing a mattress between then, the footage did not actually show anyone being carried. Instead, one grinning fighter wearing sunglasses panned his camera around to show the scene of devastation around him, in a style that - anywhere else in the world - could be mistaken with a selfie-video from an Instagram influencer. In a separate TikTok video released in March, Chechen special forces were filmed fighting house-to-house in besieged Mariupol while 'hundreds' of women and children remained trapped in the rubble of a city theatre destroyed by Russian invaders. The footage, said to have been released by pro-Putin Chechen warlord Ramzan Kadyrov, shows heavily armed fighters from the region pounding a high-rise building in the bombed-out city during a fierce gunfight with Ukrainian soldiers. The propaganda video then cuts before showing some of the Chechen fighters emerging from the building with children in their arms while supposedly 'liberating' civilians. The video emerged as hundreds of people were still feared trapped under the rubble of a theatre in the devastated city that has been obliterated by Russian forces who control the overwhelming majority of the city and are mostly focusing their airstrikes on the Soviet-era steel plant located close to the harbour, where a contingent of between 1,000-2000 Ukrainian soldiers are staging a desperate holdout alongside roughly 1,000 civilians. Chechen troops have been embedded in the National Guard of Russia and have been fighting in Ukraine since the start of the invasion.  One squad of Kadyrov's fighters was reportedly sent to try and assassinate Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky, but was destroyed by Ukraine's forces. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky switched into Russian in his nightly video address to urge Russian soldiers not to fight in Ukraine, saying even their generals expected that thousands of them would die. He said Russia has been recruiting new troops 'with little motivation and little combat experience' for the units that were gutted during the early weeks of the war so these units can be thrown back into battle. He said Russian commanders fully understand that thousands of them will die and thousands more will be wounded in the coming weeks. 'The Russian commanders are lying to their soldiers when they tell them they can expect to be held seriously responsible for refusing to fight and then also don't tell them, for example, that the Russian army is preparing additional refrigerator trucks for storing the bodies,' Mr Zelensky said late on Saturday. 'They don't tell them about the new losses the generals expect. Every Russian soldier can still save his own life. It's better for you to survive in Russia than to perish on our land.' It comes as Sweden said a Russian military plane violated Swedish airspace. The incident happened late on Friday in the Baltic Sea near the island of Bornholm. In a statement on Saturday, the Swedish Armed Forces said a Russian AN-30 propeller plane flew toward Swedish airspace and briefly entered it before leaving the area. The Swedish Air Force scrambled fighter jets which photographed the Russian plane. Swedish Defence Minister Peter Hultqvist told Swedish public radio that the violation was 'unacceptable' and 'unprofessional'. In a similar incident in early March four Russian warplanes violated Swedish airspace over the Baltic Sea. Sweden and neighbouring Finland are both considering Nato membership following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Moscow has warned that such a move would have consequences, without giving specifics. Meanwhile, Russia has been forced to merge and redeploy depleted and disparate units from failed advances in northeast Ukraine, a British military update said on Saturday. 'Shortcomings in Russian tactical coordination remain. A lack of unit-level skills and inconsistent air support have left Russia unable to fully leverage its combat mass, despite localised improvements,' the military tweeted. 'Russia hopes to rectify issues that have previously constrained its invasion by geographically concentrating combat power, shortening supply lines and simplifying command and control,' it said.",

He died in hospital shortly after police and paramedics rushed to Greenwich High Road at 2.15am this morning. British Transport Police have launched a murder investigation into the 'shocking and brutal act of violence' close to a bar in Greenwich. The man's family have been told of his death and they are being supported by specialist officers. Trains are running but not stopping at the Greenwich DLR station which has been cordoned off along with pub and hostel St Christopher's Inn.  The cordon remains at the hotel Novotel London Greenwich to St Christopher's Inn Greenwich, which sits either side of the tube station.  An investigation has been launched by the BTP who the Met Police said have made no arrest at this 'early' stage. Officers attended along with London Ambulance Service.  British Transport Police detective chief inspector Steve May said: 'This was a shocking and brutal act of violence which has resulted in a man tragically losing his life today. 'While we are at an early stage of our investigation, we believe this attack followed a fight close to the entrance of Belushi's bar on Greenwich High Road. 'Officers are working tirelessly to locate the person responsible, and I would urge anyone who may have witnessed what happened or the events leading up to it to get in touch with us as soon as possible. 'Likewise, if you were driving in the area at the time please check your dash com footage for anything untoward. Your information could be crucial to our investigation.

The rail union is balloting more than 40,000 of its members over considerations to bring 15 train services including Govia Thameslink Railway, Avanti West Coast, and West Midlands Trains to a grinding halt. RMT has blamed Network Rail's planned cut of at least 2,500 safety-critical maintenance jobs as part of a PS2 billion of savings on the network - changes that bosses say will lead to 'trains flying off the tracks'. It has also taken aim at train operators looking to freeze pay to combat the lowest passenger numbers in over 150 years. Now the union's assistant secretary general Eddie Dempsey has revealed that, in addition to potential strike action, members are also considering civil disobedience, The Telegraph reports. Micky Lynch, RMT general secretary, has warned that its members are 'extremely motivated' to deliver a 'huge yes vote' when the ballot closes on May 24 - leading to potential action as soon as June. And Government sources have warned that union officials could adopt Extinction Rebellion style tactics of blocking the railway system. Transport workers in London are to be balloted for industrial action in a dispute over pensions. Members of Unite employed at Transport for London (TfL) and London Underground will vote in the coming weeks on whether to launch a campaign of industrial action. The union said workers have been told that the value of their pensions will be cut and a final salary scheme will end following a central government-demanded review in return for pandemic-recovery funding. Unite regional officer Simon McCartney said: 'Our members are dedicated to keeping London moving. Now they are being told that they will be poorer in old age.  'This is an appalling way to treat a loyal and committed workforce. 'Workers are balloting for industrial action as a last resort. Despite repeated calls to management there have been no guarantees on pensions or job cuts. 'Strike action would inevitably cause severe disruption to public transport throughout London.' Unite's members at TfL are spread across different parts of the organisation including Dial-a Ride, London Underground and Croydon trams. The union said its members are also in dispute over pay and the threat of job losses. The ballot will close on 26 May. If members vote in favour of industrial action, strikes could begin by mid-June, although Unite said action is likely to be co-ordinated with other unions who also have members in TfL. A source told The Telegraph: 'The mind boggles at the RMT turning themselves into Extinction Rebellion and gluing themselves to the tracks - could anything be more counter-productive? 'With the railway on life support, it should worry all rail workers that their union leaders are spoiling for a confrontation before there have even been any substantive talks.' Mr Dempsey was last month accused of harbouring long-standing sympathies for pro-Putin separatists. He shared glowing praise for Luhansk rebel Aleksey Mozgovoy in an obituary following his death in 2015, while Mr Dempsey even visited the Donbas region of Ukraine seven years ago - where he posed for a picture with the pro-Russian separatist commander. Mr Dempsey is understood to be on a package worth PS108,549 as part of his RMT role. It breaks down to PS78,282 of gross salary, Employers' NI contributions of PS9,978 with pension contributions of PS20,289.  In March's issue of RMT News, he wrote: 'The union is looking at industrial action and even civil disobedience if we have to in order to alert the membership and the general public about the effects of the cuts coming down the line. 'If this continues then we must declare ourselves in dispute in order to defend our industry, defend our terms and conditions, defend our pensions and defend jobs.' And in an address to a meeting of the Communication Workers Union's annual conference on Monday, Mr Dempsey added: 'We are going to try to create a culture of civil peaceful disobedience in this country. 'We've got to get out there with industrial strategies to make sure every depot, every workplace, is a fortress for the trade union movement and people are ready to come out and defend their rights.' With further travel chaos in the summer looming, Tim Shoveller, Network Rail's regional director, said the operator 'cannot keep relying on Government handouts'. He continued: 'Our railway has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, and even as passenger numbers start to recover, we know travel habits and passenger demand have changed and the industry has to change too. 'We cannot keep relying on Government handouts, and so we must work together with train operators and our trades unions to save millions of pounds and deliver a more efficient railway. 'Our modernisation programme aims to build a sustainable future that delivers for passengers and creates better and safer jobs for our people. 'We are disappointed that the RMT has taken this decision and urge them again to work with us, not against us, as we build an affordable railway fit for the future.' Mr Shoveller added: 'We would not consider any changes that would make the railway less safe.' But RMT general secretary Mr Lynch yesterday accused the Government of 'throwing political petrol on the fire' regarding the dispute. He added: 'The changes they seek to impose on railway workers would not be acceptable to any trade union worth their salt and they represent a fundamental danger to passenger safety.'  An RMT spokesman continued: 'RMT has at no time suggested its members will glue themselves to any railway tracks during this dispute with Network Rail and the train operating companies. 'Rather than trying to mount anonymous scare stories in the media with no evidence, the Government would be better placed halting their mad-hatter cuts programme they want to unleash on the railways, endangering public safety and destroying railway workers' livelihoods. 'The RMT is focused on beating the most draconian anti-trade union laws in any western European country, in order to take lawful industrial action in June, so we can stop 2,500 safety-critical maintenance jobs being lost and protect rail passenger safety on the network.'

The multibillion-dollar order, to be unveiled in a Sydney airport hangar on Monday, brings the Australian carrier closer to launching record-breaking direct flights of nearly 20 hours on the lucrative 'kangaroo route' by mid-2025. Qantas has touted plans for the world's longest commercial flights for more than five years but delayed its 'Project Sunrise' due to the coronavirus pandemic. The deal is a breakthrough for the Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, who has described non-stop Sydney-London flights as the holy grail for the 101-year-old carrier. The Australian airline launched the route in 1947 with Lockheed Constellations, when it took several stops and 58 hours of flying.  Today's one-stop flights take almost 24 hours. Qantas in 2018 started non-stop flights from Perth, in Western Australia, to London that take 17 hours to carry passengers 14,500km or 9,000 miles. The Airbus expansion comes days after Boeing further delayed the development of its 777X jetliner, which had at one stage been in contention to allow direct flights from Australia's east coast to London and New York. An Airbus-owned A350-1000 was flying on Sunday from Toulouse to Perth, tracking service FlightRadar24 showed. Qantas, which has said it would make a significant announcement on Monday about the future of its network, declined to comment. Airbus also declined to comment. On Sunday the West Australian newspaper said, without citing sources, that the Qantas order would include 12 A350s, 20 A321XLRs and 20 A220s as well as purchase rights for 106 more airplanes spread among the different types. Qantas in December selected Airbus as the preferred supplier for a major order to renew its ageing narrowbody fleet, in a blow to its incumbent supplier Boeing. An airBaltic A220 was parked in Sydney on Sunday, FlightRadar24 showed.  That destination is not on a normal route for the European carrier.   Australia has no A220 operators at present.",
  "222b9c919bfcdecc2bc0e53046b45def4ffdfe9c1bd86227bffd9745": "This is the darkly funny moment an MP from Putin's ruling party tells the UK to 'clear off and eat porridge' before accusing Britain of stealing fish and chips from Russia. Andrey Isayev, 50, also told Brits to 'pray for your moss-covered Queen' in the bizarre tirade on main TV channel Russia 1 on Friday. The incredible comments came during a heated discussion on the Kremlin's humiliating failed invasion of Ukraine.  United Russia politician Isayev began his remarks by saying Britain and Poland are 'the mad ones' of NATO. The Western alliance is a 'two-headed dragon', he added, and 'Britain is the more evil head'. Even the Russia 1 presenters looked baffled as Isayev launched into Britain.  He slandered the country's wartime record, stating without elaboration: 'Even during World War Two, England created trouble.' The eccentric politician continued: 'We realise that they're enemies. Historically the more hardcore anti-Russian one has always been the UK. 'We too should take anti-British positions. 'Clear off back to your island. Catch your chip and fish from your foggy marshes! Pray for your moss-covered Queen!' Mr Isayev lost his job as the ruling party's deputy leader in 2013 after he was booted off a plane during a drunken brawl with cabin crew. The Duma parliamentarian threatened to fire Aeroflot flight attendants when they refused to move his assistant to business class. Fellow passengers filmed the fracas. Isayev apologised for the outburst and said he was sorry 'on behalf' of his secretary. The hilarious tirade followed a simulation on state TV of a nuclear attack on Britain. On Thursday's show the chairman of the nationalist Rodina party, Aleksey Zhuravlyov, pondered what would happen if Russia launched nuclear weapons against the UK, saying: 'one Sarmat missile and the British Isles will be no more.' When pulled up on the comment by one of the hosts, he insisted he was 'saying this seriously', while another host added that the UK has nuclear weapons too and that 'no one will survive in this war'. Producers on the show then showed viewers a map seeming to suggest missiles could be launched from Kaliningrad, the Russian enclave between Poland, Lithuania and the Baltic Sea. It suggested these could reach Berlin in 106 seconds, Paris in 200 seconds and London in 202 seconds. It comes as the UK and other western nations continue in their support for Ukraine, with allies providing equipment, military vehicles and weapons to the beleaguered country. In response to the western support of Ukraine, war-mongering Putin ordered the military to test-fire its Sarmat missiles, which are also known as Satan II. Last week Putin bragged that his country's hypersonic missiles could 'break through all modern defences' and could be ready to strike the UK 'by autumn'.",

The incident followed an alleged aggravated burglary, armed robbery and firearms incident in the Melbourne suburb of Melton on Sunday.  Initially, a car with three people in it was involved in a crash with another car at the intersection of Melton Highway and Ryans Lane in the city's north-west suburbs. Police were told the man fled the scene of a two-vehicle collision after allegedly producing a firearm and threatening the driver of the second car, at about 9.30am.  The passenger of the second vehicle, a 63-year-old woman, was later taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. As witnesses tried to help the woman, the driver of the other car allegedly pulled out a gun.  'They all sort of backed away from him a little bit and everyone was just saying 'He has a gun' as he was running off with his girlfriend,' Steven Tucker told Channel Nine.   A search was conducted of the area before information was received that the man, acting on his own, had allegedly committed an aggravated burglary at an address on Old Park Drive, Melton at around 11.30am.  He allegedly produced a firearm, threatened the occupants and stole their Kia Sportage SUV.  'It's alleged that the same male entered a premises and held a woman at gunpoint by pushing her to the wall and taking the car keys to her car,' said Inspector Rhonda Brown of Victoria Police.  The vehicle was allegedly driven in an erratic and dangerous manner, at high speeds, often crossing onto the wrong side of the road and at times leaving the road completely.  The SUV was then recorded by helicopter footage trying to escape from police pursuers in unmarked cars.  The vehicle became airborne at one one point as it went over a footpath.    It was also filmed crossing onto the wrong side of the road and narrowly avoiding other cars. The SUV then crossed a median strip and went straight through the centre of a roundabout. Police pursued the car to Bacchus Marsh before ramming it on Bond Street and arresting the male about 12.05pm.  The man fell out of the vehicle before being captured by officers wearing camouflage gear, including green military-style jackets and helmets.  Video footage shows the man being kicked and punched by officers.  'We're talking about here, a man who has allegedly produced firearms at two incidents in this long-running scenario,' said Inspector Brown. 'We always review what we do. But at this stage I'm comfortable with what's occurred.' A witness the arrested man looked 'hurt'.  A 24-year-old Box Hill man was arrested at the scene and is currently assisting police with their enquiries.  Police believe he may have been drug affected. He is in hospital under police guard.  His injuries are thought not to have been caused by his arrest, but the arrest will be subject to a review, which is standard procedure.  The man is expected to be charged when he is well enough to be interviewed by police.   Anyone who witnessed the incident or with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or make a report at crimestoppersvic.com.au. ",
  "dfd807cd517a06bc3d9fd9aac7a2fdd4a7af41c1591e349241eb639b": "A group of Apple employees have accused the big-tech giant of only benefiting privileged staff with its push for corporate workers to return to the office, saying that the shift back to an in-person model will make the company 'younger, whiter, [and] more male-dominated.' The employees, organized under the newly-formed group Apple Together, petitioned the company on Friday in an open letter after CEO Tim Cook told staffers that they would need to work from the office one day a week starting on April 11, two days per week after three weeks, and three days per week after May 23.  They wrote that the decision to bring employees back to the office was not motivated by a 'need to commune in person,' as Cook wrote in his letter to staff, but rather was driven by the company's 'fear of the future of work, fear of worker autonomy [and] fear of losing control.' Although Apple will 'likely always find people willing to work here,' the group wrote, the shift back to working in the office will 'change the makeup of [the company's workforce].'   'It will lead to privileges deciding who can work for Apple, not who'd be the best fit,' the group wrote. 'Privileges like 'being born in the the right place so you don't have to relocate', or 'being young enough to start a new life in a new city/country' or 'having a stay-at-home spouse who will move with you.'' 'And privileges like being born into a gender that society doesn't expect the majority of care-work from, so it's easy to disappear into an office all day, without doing your fair share of unpaid work in society. Or being rich enough to pay others to do your care-work for you.' Rather than 'throwing money at the problem and just increasing referral bonuses to replace those of our colleagues who left over the executive team's inflexibility,' the group advocates for continuing a remote work model so that 'everyone who wants to work at Apple is able to do so.' There has been a marked uptick in diversity at Apple amid the pandemic, although it is unclear whether this was driven by the company's shift to remote work.  In 2014, the company's workforce was made up of 70 percent men and 30 percent women, but those percentages have shifted - according to Apple's 2022 Inclusion and Diversity Report, 65.2 percent of the workforce is now male and 34.8 percent are female.    Apple's leadership saw an 87 percent increase in female employees worldwide, the company boasted, and its total female workforce grew by 89 percent.  The company hired more minorities than ever before in 2021 - that wasy, 25 percent of Apple's leadership roles and 41 percent of its retail positions were filled by Black and Hispanic workers.         Apple Together's qualms extended past diversity, however - the group laid out five additional reasons for their displeasure with the company's return to in-person work.  They bemoaned that the company would force employees to make unnecessary commutes to work, and called out a disconnect between the company's marketing to customers using its products to work remotely from around the world and its treatment of staffers.  'How can we understand what problems of remote work need solving in our products if we don't live it?' reads the letter.  They also mocked Cook's description of 'the serendipity that comes from bumping into colleagues,' arguing that this fanciful vision was impossible between the company's 37 US offices even before the company went remote during the pandemic.  'We are not all in one place. We don't have just one office, we have many. And often, our functional organizations have their own office buildings, in which employees from other orgs cannot work,' they wrote. 'This siloed structure is part of our culture.' In September, while tensions over the company's return to in-person work were still brewing before Apple's plans to bring workers back were thwarted by the onset of COVID-19's Delta variant, Apple engineer Cher Scarlett spoke out to Vox about this expectation of in-person collaboration.     'There's this idea that people skateboarding around tech campuses are bumping into each other and coming up with great new inventions,' said Scarlett, who joined the company during the pandemic and became a leader in organizing her colleagues on pushing for more remote work. 'That's just not true.' Scarlett, one of two founding members of Apple Together when it was first formed in August under the name 'Apple Too,' left the company in November and has pending complaints with the labor board.  She and Janneke Parrish, who was also fired and has also filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board, encouraged staffers to come forward with stories of racism, sexism or discrimination in their workplace.      A spokesperson for Apple Together told CNN Business, an employee who works on hardware engineering in the Bay Area and asked to remain anonymous, told the outlet that there are about 200 workers within the group - in total, Apple has more than 100,000 employees in the United States.       'There is such a huge disconnect between executive leadership and the individuals,' the employee said, 'The further you go up in the chain, the more that empathy erodes.' Apple Together said in its letter that it was much easier to collaborate with coworkers from their home offices, rather than Apple's newer offices with open floor plans.  They also hit out at the company's recent decision to keep employees in different departments and locations of the company in separate Slack workplaces, making it 'impossible to create shared community spaces where serendipity could have happened.' 'We are not asking for everyone to be forced to work from home,' the letter read. 'we are asking to decide for ourselves, together with our teams and direct manager, what kind of work arrangement works best for each one of us, be that in an office, work from home, or a hybrid approach.   Apple's correspondence to employees comes after other Big Tech giants, like Twitter and Facebook, have told its employees that they can work from home indefinitely.  ",

But Wendy did not stop there and after a brief swim, climbed out of the pool having washed the salt water away and lumbered onto a sun lounger to the bemusement of tourists at the exclusive resort - including one man who was forced to scamper away when the sea lion decided she was going to rest on his chair.

  "8ddc02f6edb9ba183a4355de63c49695b264a572ec8d75fde9746a1a": "William Tyrrell's foster mother fought to keep secret the truth about the missing toddler, arguing that revealing he was a foster child would intensify publicity and force her family into hiding. The now 57-year-old was part of the court battle waged to keep a veil of secrecy over William's foster status in the years after he vanished without trace.  Daily Mail Australia has obtained an affidavit written by the foster mother two years after William vanished from her mother's house in the NSW Mid North Coast town of Kendall on September 12, 2014. In the document designed to keep William's foster care past under wraps, the foster mother claimed disclosure 'will lead to intense interest from the public and a much larger number of people will learn William was in foster care'. This was despite the fact the foster mother and father were actively engaged in the massive 'Where's William' publicity crusade with former lead detective Gary Jubelin. The PR campaign, which raised more than $1 million in public donations, had as its main objectives 'to manage public consciousness surrounding the disappearance' and 'empower William's Parents as the foremost voice for William'.   This referred to the foster mother and foster father rather than William's parents, at a time when the toddler's out-of-home care when he disappeared was one of the legal community's worst kept secrets.   'I am responsible for determining the appropriate media strategy (which) takes into account the views of ... the Department of Family and Community Services (FACS),' Mr Jubelin said in a court affidavit also obtained by Daily Mail Australia. He said information should be revealed 'in a managed way' and revealing that the missing toddler had been removed from his biological parents and placed with the foster couple 'would be damaging to the investigation'. The details of the court battle to shed light on William's status can be revealed as the foster parents are due to be listed for a two-day hearing on charges they stalked, intimidated and assaulted a child. Separate lawyers for the foster couple appeared on Friday in Hornsby Local Court which heard police have 'a large amount of surveillance device material' on the couple and up to ten witnesses for the prosecution. Lawyers Sharon Ramsden for the foster father and Lauren Macdougall for the foster mother told the court they each had one witness for the defence. The child police allege the foster mother and foster father assaulted and then stalked is the same child mentioned in the foster foster mother's affidavit. In the document the foster mother contends that exposing William's foster status would put that same child at high risk of 'security issues' and 'long term psychological impacts'. The foster mother says the child, who had lived with her at the time, was at risk of being recognised, then targeted and harassed. This would 'probably lead to a lot of unwanted attention ... could potentially have security issues (and) longer term psychological impacts'. The foster mother's statement was among the documents in the action taken out by FACS to obstruct a lone child advocate's bid to make public William's status.  Armed with senior lawyers, the now defunct department desperately fought to silence advocate Allanna Pearl Smith, but instead suffered a stinging loss in the Supreme Court and again in the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal.   The foster mother said in the affidavit that many details about her and the foster father were on social media and that FACS' lawyers had told her Ms Smith wanted the foster fact out there. 'Ms Smith intends to publish the fact that William was in foster care in the internet,' she says in the affidavit, 'she also wants to circulate a petition calling for an inquest. 'If she is allowed to do that ... if a much larger number of people become aware that William was in foster care .. . the more likely it is that people 'will be able to put two and two together' and identify and locate us. 'People will assume that (we) were involved in William's disappearance ... we will be harassed. 'It is likely that we would have to move from our home, probably change jobs and we may need to take steps to change our identity.' She said it was the 'mainstream media' which had called them William's 'parents' and they had 'followed police advice' about how to handle publicity. In his statement supporting FACS' continued concealment about William's foster status, Mr Jubelin said the Tyrrell strike force's media strategy 'takes into account the views of  (FACS) and accommodates these views where possible'. He conjectured that releasing the foster information 'in an unmanaged way ... is likely to provoke significant interest and lead to intense speculation and rumour in the media and among the general public'. He warned the foster revelation 'may also divert police resources away from the investigation' to respond to that rumour.  Then FACS director Bryony Foster said in her affidavit filed to argue its case that the department 'and police were concerned that at the time saturating the media might not be beneficial as it could drive the abductor underground'. FACS tried to silence Ms Smith and the Facebook group, Walking Warriors 4 Missing Children, with an injunction, arguing that identifying William would have a 'stigmatising' effect.  At the time the Walking Warriors group was seen as a fringe rival by the Where's William campaign, which had logos and merchandise featuring William's face and the Spiderman suit he was wearing in his last known photograph. In a stunning victory for Ms Smith 2016, Justice Paul Brereton ruled William could be revealed as a foster child, but his judgment could not be revealed as FACS immediately appealed. The department lost again in August 2017, when the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal upheld Justice Brereton's decision and only then did the truth finally come out. His Honour said it was inexplicable why William's carers (the foster parents) had been represented as William's parents. He said it was probable that William had died, there was a substantial public interest in the foster care system and Ms Smith had the 'right of free expression' about it. About  the repercussions of revealing William's foster status, Justice Brereton said 'I am quite unpersuaded that it would hinder it (the police investigation)'. Ms Smith applauded the court victory and later said she had a 'primal connection' to help his birth mother. This stemmed from the fact she herself had been separated from her real mother in the foster system, in which she was abused. 'I asked the court to ask William's biological parents what they thought and it came back that they did not oppose the publication of the fact William was in foster care,' Ms Smith told Daily Mail Australia.  She said she believed the FACS case was hollow and more about the need to keep secrets, and about the prestige of holding special knowledge that others didn't have. 'It was like a club. Tell me where they talk about the need for William to be found in any of the statements?' Her motivation had been to stand up for the birth mother who she didn't know, although she and Ms Smith have since met in the course of the William Tyrrell inquest she had also fought for.     'I feel her loss, that primal loss, through no fault of her own,' Ms Smith said. 'The only thing she did wrong was being young, with no support of her own... I feel for that young woman and I have never even met her.' Mr Jubelin stated publicly after Ms Smith's court win, that the foster revelation had not damaged his investigation. He left the NSW police Force in 2019, after being removed from the Tyrrell strike force and charged with breaching the Surveillance Devices Act for illegally recording a Tyrrell case person of interest. Mr Jubelin was convicted of four four counts of recording a person without permission, and fined $10,000. He later lost an appeal against conviction in the NSW District Court. The publicity campaign he launched with FACs and the foster parents, using PR firm Insight Communications, had helped double Strike Force Rosann's funds from state coffers and establish a $1 million reward by the State Government. Although no-one has collected the reward, or been charged over his disappearance, 'Where's William Tyrrell? Bring Him Home' helped make him Australia's most high profile missing child.  Ms Smith, who remains frustrated to this day about the lack of success in finding William's likely abductor or killer, is highly critical of PR strategy. 'What, William's face was used to develop a brand? A brand of a cute kid lost in a SpiderMan suit?' she said. 'It hasn't helped find him has it, and where's the investigation gone? William's (birth) parents have no answers and it'll be eight years in September that he vanished while in the care of the state foster system.'   Between 2014 and 2016, Ms Smith went out every weekend to colllect the 10,00 signatures required to petition the NSW Government to hold an inquest into William's case. She has gathered around 8500 when police finally agreed that an inquest was needed, with that inquest starting in 2019 but yet to conclude.   Earlier this month, William Tyrrell's foster mother was charged with allegedly lying to the secretive state Crime Commission. This followed a the foster father being charged with two counts of falsifying information to the commission, after appearing before it last November. This was days before Detective Chief Inspector David Laidlaw, the police commander who took over Strike Force Rosann from Mr Jubelin, launched a new search for the boy's remains near his foster grandmother's Kendall house. Police revealed at the time that the foster mother and her mother were persons of interest in William's disappearance. The foster parents are due  to face court in late May on the lying allegations.

Simon James Green was due to visit the John Fisher School in Purley, Croydon, to discuss his queer fiction.  The award-winning author has written 12 books for children and young adults that feature LGBT+ characters, including Heartbreak Boys, Noah Can't Even and Gay Club! -- which is being released on May 5. Since his visit was cancelled last month, teachers have gone on strike, with staff shortages closing the school. On Thursday, Mr Green Tweeted his support for the teachers. There were around 40 people outside the school gates as part of the National Education Union (NEU) action, the BBC reported. '@NEUnion members from John Fisher school are striking over my banned school visit and their sacked governors,' Mr Green said. 'They're standing up for LGBT students everywhere who need to see the reality of their lives in books. Please show them how much support they have.'  Daniel Kebede, national president of the NEU, said the strike was an 'absolute last resort'. 'Staff and pupils are absolutely gutted about what has happened,' he told the BBC. 'Banning a gay author from attending a book talk in the school sends out a really horrific message to the young people in this school and particularly to those who may be gay or lesbian. 'I would like everybody to consider how those particular children feel right now.'  The school had planned to host the author on March 3, but staff were advised to cancel the visit by Diocesan Schools Commissioner, Simon Hughes. In a statement on March 3, Dr Hughes said: 'From time to time materials or events emerge for consideration that fall outside the scope of what is permissible in a Catholic school. 'In such circumstances, we have no alternative but to affirm our unequivocal and well-known theological and moral precepts and to act in accordance with them.' School governors voted against this recommendation, but intervention from the archdiocese saw the event cancelled.  This prompted two governors to resign, with the rest removed from their posts by the archdiocese, according to an Ofsted report. There was a sudden inspection on March 16, after the incident earlier that month.  In a letter sent to school head teacher Philip McCullagh by Ofsted inspector Sarah Murphy on Monday, Ms Murphy wrote that 'elected parent and staff governors, as well as the local authority governor' were no longer in their roles after the incident, but 'have since been reinstated'. She said that 'some leaders, staff and pupils have been left feeling angry, confused and frustrated' by the situation. 'Others are worried about the impression these events might give of the school's ethos,' she wrote.   The archdiocese has now reacted to the report, claiming it has 'inaccuracies' and includes evidence 'drawn solely from media reports', and called for another review. In a statement, it said: 'Respect for the God-given dignity of each human life sits at the heart of Catholic education and respect is a two-way street.  'Literature that insults the faith, which in the case of Mr Green's book was a highly sexualised re-writing of the Lord's Prayer, understandably causes offence to many Christians, and as such has no place in a Catholic school.  'It is important that the school can now move on from this, and the Diocesan Education Commission will continue to work with the Local Authority, Governing Body, unions, and senior leaders at The John Fisher, in the best interest of parents, pupils and all members of staff.'  The archdiocese's position throughout has caused widespread criticism over the 'message' that it sends to LGBT+ students.  On Friday, headteachers at the NAHT school leaders' conference in Telford, called for Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi to investigate the archdiocese, GB News reported.  Speaking at the event, Dave Woods, head of Beaconsfield Primary School, said: 'To the pupils, the staff, the parents, it sends a message of intolerance or harking-back to those dark days of exclusion and invisibility to that abnormality, which many LGBT adults remember, or try to block out from their own past experiences.' And the headteacher of a Church of England school, Clive Leach, said: 'This action is not the faith I hold as a Christian ... it is not as Christ as I understand him would hold - he stood by those who were different'. The leaders voted for a motion, which also called for NAHT members to 'stand in solidarity with the staff and governors of John Fisher School who recognise value and celebrate the humanity, the rights and the lives of young LGBT+ people in their community.' Staff from John Fisher School sent a video to conference attendees, thanking them for their recent support. 'We belong to a great school, and the governance is in disarray,' they added. 'The events of the last seven weeks have placed an enormous strain on our community.' ",

With Russian vehicles and armoured trucks getting stuck in the mud when veering off road, officials in the West are pointing to Chinese exports as a key factor behind the stalled invasion of Ukraine. The poor quality of the tyres has meant Russian vehicles often get mired in difficult terrain, slowing the military advance of Putin's forces as the weather turns wetter. NATO vehicles use Michelin XZL tyres, but Chinese businesses often copy the intellectual property of Western companies to produce cheaper copies in greater quantities. 'Russian generals are notoriously corrupt. Russia has a defense budget of around PS60billion a year, but much of that budget is siphoned off at various levels,' an intelligence source told the New Zealand Times. 'The impact of this is that the Russians are forced to buy cheap tires to fit on expensive armored vehicles, and they just don't work.' China's version of the tire is the Yellow Sea YS20, of significantly poorer quality, according to self-described 'tyre expert' and University of Chicargo academic Karl Muth. A set of 50 Michelin XZL tyres retails on Alibaba at approximately $36,000, whereas 50 sets of the Chinese equivalent retails at around $208. Poor vehicle maintenance could also partially explain the stalling. Leaving tyres in direct sunlight for months on end often causes them to rip, adding to the amount of abandoned vehicles Ukrainians have encountered in various parts of the country during the war. One photo shows a Russian Army Pantsir-S1 SAM stuck in the mud after its tyres burst.   'There is a huge operational level implication in this,' commented Trent Telenko, a retired US Department of Defence Civil Servant who carried out vehicle maintenance for the US army. 'If the Russian Army was too corrupt to exercise a Pantsir-S1. They were too corrupt to exercise the trucks & wheeled AFV's now in Ukraine.' Potential tyre ruptures may be forcing the Russian army to stick to roads to else risk losing their armoured cars in the muck, leaving them more exposed to drone attacks and military ambushes.   Crimea and south Ukraine is dryer with terrain posing less of a risk for the Russian military, but wet conditions pose a challenge elsewhere in the country.  Russia is attempting a push into the Donbass region of east Ukraine, hoping to solidify its foothold in the country to place itself in a stronger bargaining position.  'Putin has modified his approach,' ex-MI6 chief Sit Alex Younger told the Sunday Mirror. 'Arguably his objectives are more realistic and he is not going to give up.' Russia has been forced to merge and redeploy depleted and disparate units from failed advances in northeast Ukraine, a British military update said on Saturday. Kyiv estimates its forces have now killed 22,400 Russian soldiers, up from 22,100 last week.  The Russin army will be unable to fight another war for years because of catastrophic kit losses in Ukraine, defence experts have also said. Military analyst Henry Boyd from the International Institute for Strategic Studies said Putin could still draw on sizeable, Soviet-era reserve forces stationed across Russia. But most Russian soldiers could be unable to use it, he added, owing to insufficient training planning for troops having to rely on outdated equipment. Russia's land army consisted of 280,000 full-time active soldiers compared with Ukraine's 125,600. But the amount of Russian soldiers needed to seize the whole country and control the entire population would be close to one million, putting Russia's chances of occupying the entire country out of reach.  A flood of Ukrainian conscripts, high-tech weaponry sent by NATO countries and Russian strategic failures have all helped stymie the Russian advance. ",
  "3abc16a5a34d809864807700ab057bcb5814aeb6b793b636e7dcf56c": "Actor Noel Clarke is suing Bafta for defamation after his membership was suspended over allegations of sexual misconduct and bullying - weeks after the Metropolitan Police said it will not investigate the claims. Clarke, who starred in and produced Sky hit Bulletproof and was in Doctor Who for five years, is understood to have filed papers at the High Court last week. It comes after the actor won the Outstanding British Contribution to Cinema last year, before having his membership suspended 'until further notice' when 20 women made claims to The Guardian alleging sexual harassment and bullying. Clarke denied all allegations and the Met decided against launching a criminal probe last month - concluding the accusations did not 'meet the threshold' for a police probe. A spokesperson for Bafta told The Sunday Times: 'A year ago, BAFTA was transparent about what led to Mr Clarke's award and membership being suspended following serious accusations of groping, harassment and bullying by 20 women published by The Guardian. 'We stand by our decision and are very surprised by the news he now wishes to sue the arts charity. If proceedings are served, we will of course defend ourselves.' Clarke is also suing The Guardian Media Group, who published the allegations in April, along with Conde Nast, a group that owns titles including GQ, after it ran an interview with the two journalists who wrote the story. Last summer, Mr Clarke quit his TV production company along with co-founder Jason Maza, following the sexual misconduct accusations. Mr Clarke stood down as director of Unstoppable Film and Television Limited and also as a person of 'significant control' in charge of the company. It had produced his Sky series Bulletproof as well as films including Adulthood and Brotherhood. But he and director Mr Maza renamed one of their TV firms, Unstoppable Entertainment Limited. It is now called Iconoclast Entertainment Limited and coincides with Clarke's return to social media, where he liked a tweet saying 'Most people don't want the truth'. The word Iconoclast usually refers to an individual who attacks or ignores beliefs or institutions. Mr Clarke also quit his posts with another company, Crongton Knights, which had been set up to manage production of a drama of the same name, and a company called Something in the Air, which he set up in November 2020. Last year, Mr Clarke apologised 'deeply' for his actions and said he would be seeking professional help, but 'vehemently' denied sexual misconduct or criminal behaviour.",
  "90bb8b6f694d04de93f420353586e4f620191472ebf2920066143fc0": "The Government will spend PS53,000 researching whether people are accepting of toilet water being treated and then pumped back into the water supply.  But the tender from the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) acknowledges that some recycling schemes have been 'rejected' in the USA where they have been called 'sewerage beverage' and 'toilet to tap'.   The study will look at 'public attitude and public acceptability towards water recycling (water reuse) as a source for drinking water treatment' as some households in the UK face water shortages by the 2050s.  The news comes as the water regulator Ofwat has launched a probe into 'widespread shortcomings' concerning sewage treatment works and water companies have hiked their bills by 10% this month.   MPs have already blasted water companies that made PS2.8billion in profit in 2021 over rivers - where sewage currently ends up - becoming a 'chemical cocktail' of sewage, agricultural waste, and plastics. Cranfield University, who was awarded the contract in April, will 'undertake a social science study of public perceptions of water recycling' and 'provide a final report including recommendations and strategies to inform the public on water recycling' Drawn up in the name of George Eustice, the Environment Secretary, it also says:  'A potential source of water is the recycling (or reuse) of wastewater.  'More understanding is required on the public acceptability and public perception of planned recycling of wastewater for potable water use.' The study, first reported by the Telegraph, is set to come to a close on November 17.   The three water regulators Ofwat, Environment Agency and Drinking Water Inspectorate are also considering schemes that use 'indirect potable recycling' known as 'toilet-to-tap' and there are three planned sites.  The government report also notes that many homes in the UK being supplied by rivers source already have 'unplanned indirect reuse'.  Previous research in South-East England also found that there was overall support for the move with only 'Muslim respondents showing significantly less support than other groups'. In 2018, a study by scientists at the University of California, found that recycled toilet water is just as tasty as bottled water and better than tap water.  In the 'blind' test of 'toilet to tap' water, volunteers even admitted they preferred it to drinking tap water.  According to the Environment Agency, over 3,000 million litres per day, equivalent to 20 million people or a third of the UK population, are lost through leakage in England. Around 20% of water put into the supply leaks, the body, which has a 'noticeable effect' on the total demand for water. ",
  "acb687bb6c211c698a3ce3940b3d01a7d0ace6a775d740de706d3635": "Aussie blokes have been buying up kitted out 4WDs in the hope of exploring the country. But their adventures into the wild are turning into a nightmare, with many getting bogged on beaches, grasslands and muddy bushland surfaces. Tow truck drivers have been making a fortune rescuing Aussie blokes 'with all the gear and no idea' and have issued a blunt warning to drivers with 'no skill level'. Many are unaware of how to safely operate these vehicles on surfaces other than tarmac, before they get stuck or break down hundreds of kilometres from help. One Queensland company reported 11 rescues of bogged vehicles over the Easter long weekend. James Stewart, director of Driving Solutions, told Daily Mail Australia  that more drivers purchased expensive off-road vehicles to travel around and see Australia during the coronavirus pandemic while international borders were closed.  'There's more people travelling around Australia so the number of bogged vehicles is more visible,' he said. 'The cars [4WD's] are more compatible [with off-road terrain] now and it makes drivers more comfortable and overconfident. Eventually conditions are catching people out.' 'They [drivers] then usually give us a call and think, 'Oh s**t, I wish I had done this course'.   Stewart's company runs a specialised 4WD course that helps Aussies develop safer off-road driving skills.   Stewart says he only 'wishes' his business could reach new 4WD drivers before they make their 'first mistake'.  'Four wheel driving is the most dangerous driving,' he continued. 'The tracks are a living organism and forever changing due to the weather conditions.' 'It's important to get an understanding of what your car can do and what the driver can do.'   Andrew Boyd from Toyota Land Cruiser Club of Australia believes many Aussies are buying 4WD's without being properly informed by dealers on how to safely operate them. 'They [buyers] take them out of the showrooms. The dealers would not tell these people the different buttons to press,' Boyd said. 'They then take them out to the beaches and get into all sorts of trouble.' Boyd recalled a time he had just purchased a new 4WD when he was in his 20s and took it out to a beach for the first time. He soon found himself bogged in the sand but was fortunately helped by a driver passing by who informed Boyd that his tyre pressure was the reason he was stuck. 'Someone drove up to me and told me,' Have you let your tyres down?'' Boyd recounted. 'When I got home my brother told me to join this club. It taught me how to drive these vehicles,' he added. David Wilson from Adventure 4WD agreed with the point that there are now more drivers than ever off road after the pandemic - hence a higher number of incidents. 'Post-Covid there's been a massive spike in interest in Aussies wanting to travel around the country and plenty have bought new or second-hand vehicles to do just that,' he said.  Wilson explained that crashing down or getting bogged while driving on new terrain can be an 'expensive exercise' and driver training can help mitigate the chances of a breakdown occurring. 'Budding travellers can reference plenty of sites that are helpful to offer pointers to vehicle operation and management. That's good and so too experience sourced from a practical course, the sort of thing we do here at Adventure 4WD.' It comes as another driver earlier this week walked for nine hours for help after their 4WD became bogged in black soil in outback Queensland.  A 24-year-old man became stuck in the black soil on Tuesday night after his vehicle veered off road near the outback town of Aramac, according to the ABC. The man, who was not from the area, ended up walking nine hours in the pitch black along Torrens Creek Road to find help and was eventually found by a local resident who contacted police on Wednesday. The conditions in the area had recently changed from dry to soft and muddy due to heavy rainfall. Police reported that the man had been located about 30 kilometres from his vehicle and was 'travelling from Townsville' without 'any knowledge of the area itself'. It's not only inexperienced or novice 4WD drivers getting stuck off road. Last year, one driver became stuck when they took their $150,000 Maserati Levante SUV out onto Stockton Beach in northern New South Wales. A photo surfaced online showing the bogged luxury vehicle, with a Land Rover Discovery behind it. Locals from Newcastle, north of Sydney, said the tourists should have known that the Maserati was not equipped for driving on deep sand. 'This is one of the dumbest things I've seen in my life,' one person commented. 'Money doesn't buy brains.'   The luxury Maserati Levante SUV has an 'all-wheel drive' system - but is not a proper 4WD with low and high range and the ability to lock the differential between the vehicle's two axles. Such vehicles do not have the capacity to apply high torque to one set of wheels to pull the car forward while the other wheels are bogged. 'Anyone taking a Maserati onto a beach deserves to get bogged,' one person said after a photo of a young couple struggling in the sand dunes was shared online. Others joked that at least the stranded drivers should be able to afford the fees to hire a tow driver if they can pay $150,000 for a car. The luxury cars are not designed to be driven on rough terrain and sand dunes, despite their appearance. Permit holders at the Stockton Beach are able to travel along the sand dunes in a 4WD, but require a particular permit to ensure they are eligible to travel in the conditions. Australians are being urged to take a 4WD course before going off road. Courses cover all the basics of 4WDing including an understanding of the 4WD system, buttons, maintenance, fault checking, identifying the smoothest routes and travelling on different types of terrain.

  "ced55ecd84b79427334de0917897a32092be8ed8ca395d75a7b59db9": "Three members of a family have been convicted of fraud after swindling a local authority out of PS734,000 by faking a neurological condition to claim a care package for 12 years. Husband and wife Laura and Philip Borrell - who once appeared on This Morning to discuss dementia - along with Mrs Borrell's mother, Frances Noble, conspired to commit fraud by convincing Hertfordshire County Council that Ms Noble, 66, had a brain disorder. The trio, from the village of Weston, near Hitchin, succeeded in accessing a 'direct payments care package' worth PS733,936.20 from the council between August 1, 2005 and November 30, 2018, according to The Comet. It is believed to be one of the largest frauds ever committed against a local authority.  Care packages such as the one they received are meant for those who need assistance in paying for their own care and support services - but the Borrells and Noble kept the money for themselves.  Neighbours started to become suspicious after noticing that although Mrs Borrell did not appear to work, they saw a huge number of packages arrive at her house. One resident told The Times: 'Delivery vans all day long... ordering lots of stuff, like money was no object.' Another added: 'There were Amazon vans coming every single day. And then this brand new top-of-the-range Volvo arrived. You started thinking, what does he do? What does she do?' Hertfordshire county council then began a fraud investigation after carers became suspicious that Noble was exaggerating the extent of her needs. Subsequently, the Borrells were accused of assisting the pensioner by laundering the proceeds of her crime.  All three - who have lived in Germany for the past few months - were due to stand trial at St Albans Crown Court on Wednesday, April 27 after pleading not guilty in June 2020. They changed their pleas to guilty this week and are due to be sentenced on June 24. Although the Borrells returned to the UK ten days ago before their court hearing, Frances Noble is still in Berlin, and continues to deny any wrongdoing. The pensioner said that the guilty pleas were an effort to bring an end to a case they are running out of money to fight, according to The Times. Meanwhile, in 2017, Mrs Borrell - then aged 39 - appeared on This Morning, where she was introduced by hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield as 'one of the youngest people to be diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia'. She told them she'd received the devastating dementia diagnosis but that it had been a battle to initially get doctors to take her seriously. Borrell said doctors were baffled by her condition, assuming she was too young to have dementia, and told her she was being 'hysterical'.   Appearing alongside her husband, Borrell said: 'I thought I was absolutely going crazy. They [neurologists] were vile, they were so rude to me, they even referred to me as a hysterical white female.'   Laura explained how she had to give up her studies and became afraid to leave the house when she found herself easily confused, forgetful and struggling with her speech. In June 2015, she said that tests revealed she had frontotemporal degenerative dementia - a condition very rarely seen in anyone under the age of 65. The family then began fundraising so she could have one last road trip with her husband before her memories were 'taken away'. Mrs Borrell said her symptoms became progressively worse and she dropped out of her law degree at the University of London, despite having another two years of the course still to complete. Unan Choudhury, a lawyer representing Laura, told The Times that she denies any allegation of wrongdoing relating to the dementia.  He said: 'She has suffered with serious neurological illnesses in the past and continues to suffer with illnesses now. She is receiving specialist treatment for her various conditions.'",
  "2a0d627e35193f0fec10715e63cbcc7025b329355b6e351e66571ccc": "A high school's new half-a-million dollar toilet block redevelopment has been compared to a prison with iron bars to 'prevent them from vaping', students claim. Work on the Cleveland District High School facilities is under construction, with the Queensland Education Department saying the project was an upgrade and in no way linked to e-cigarettes. Both the student council and the P&C have reviewed the plans and given the design the okay, the department said. But one student said vaping was an issue at the school, and the $500,000 project was an invasion of privacy for the entire student cohort. 'It's like a prison,' one student told The Courier Mail.  They said a teacher told them non-vapers would not be affected, but they felt they were being unfairly targeted.  'I don't think the school should punish everyone.'  'A lot of students are upset by it and it's not going to stop them vaping.' An education department spokesperson said the new toilet block features private cubicles, but the wash basins were in an open area surrounded by metal bars - to ensure better ventilation and safety.  'The refit of the toilet blocks is not related in any way to vaping,' the spokesman said.  The current redevelopment affects the male toilets but not the female amenities with those having been done in a similar style with bars three years ago.  Another south-east Queensland school, Immanuel Lutheran College, revealed last month they would be cracking down on vaping by installing vape detectors on CCTV camera near toilet blocks.  Principal Colin Minke said Instagram and TikTok had 'glamourised' vaping and he was working 'diligently to educate students on their dangers'.  Queensland Education Minister Grace Grace earlier this year said vaping was not a rapidly growing problem. 'Obviously, vaping is a concern, but it's no bigger an issue than kids bringing cigarettes to school in my day - it's not a bigger issue than that.' Ms Grace later backtracked those comments saying she intended to communicate vaping is as serious an issue as smoking and was not trying to downplay the practice. ",
  "07c210b9a73862f66cc3dcffe94337aef377e2f408da12fa073beaf6": "Anthony Albanese has positioned Labor as better than the coalition on climate, housing and health, as the party held its campaign launch in Perth. The pitch came as Prime Minister Scott Morrison returned to the issue of online safety, as he sought to shore up and win Sydney seats. Mr Albanese said the May 21 election was a choice between 'shaping the future or being shaped by it'. The launch at Perth's Optus Stadium included new promises on cheaper medicines, electric vehicle charging stations and equity for first home buyers. 'This government has had a decade in office and in another three years the problems we need to fix will be even bigger,' Mr Albanese said. 'We can do better.' Housing is likely to be a hot topic this week with the Reserve Bank widely expected to lift the cash rate on Tuesday, for the first time in 12 years. Labor's Help to Buy scheme will provide an equity contribution of as much as 40 per cent of the purchase price of a new home and up to 30 per cent for an existing dwelling for 10,000 Australians. The scheme will enable savings up to $380,000 for new homes and $285,000 for existing ones, with price caps of between $550,000 and $950,000 depending on the state and region. However, Mr Morrison said the approach was flawed. 'They (the Labor government) will have equity in your home and as that your equity goes up, they're gonna keep it,' he said. Labor also one-upped the coalition on medicines, announcing drugs on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will cost a maximum of $30, with a $12.50 reduction for general patients. Gender pay equity will become an objective in the Fair Work Act and there will be more electric-vehicle charging stations. More broadly, Mr Albanese said Labor would bring the principles of universal, affordable and quality service to child care and aged care. 'For too long, our youngest Australians and our oldest Australians and their families have lived with broken systems ... I will make it the Labor government's mission to fix this.' Mr Morrison announced the coalition's blueprint to improve online safety, an issue he also intends to take up - if re-elected - at a global level at the G20 summit in Bali later in the year. Big tech will be required to build enhanced safety controls into their devices that are easy for parents to use and hard for children to bypass. The eSafety Commissioner would work with Apple, Samsung and others to design device settings and a binding code under the Online Safety Act. If the industry does not create these controls within 12 months of the government being returned, it would move to force companies to comply with regulations. On broader economic issues, asked what the coalition would do about rising grocery prices, Mr Morrison said he had already halved the petrol tax, provided cash payments to pensioners and implemented an income tax break to start on July 1. He said the war on Europe and the ongoing impact on supply chains of the Covid pandemic were key pressures on inflation. 'The Labor Party think they have some kind of Harry Potter wand that you can just raise in government and it changes the price of a lettuce - it's ridiculous,' Mr Morrison said. 'That shows a complete lack of understanding of what is driving prices.' Mr Morrison held a local campaign rally in the seat of Reid, as Liberal strategists fear the loss of a swathe of seats in Sydney to Labor and independent candidates. An average of the most recent opinion polls puts Labor on 54 per cent of the two-party preferred vote - which if replicated on election day would deliver a comfortable majority. Mr Morrison and Mr Albanese will take part in the second leaders' debate on May 8. Labor leader Anthony Albanese has unveiled new policies on health, housing and equality as he launched the party's campaign in Perth. HOUSING: * The Help to Buy scheme will provide an equity contribution of as much as 40 per cent of the purchase price of a new home and up to 30 per cent for an existing dwelling for 10,000 Australians. * The scheme enables savings of up to $380,000 for new homes and $285,000 for existing ones, with price caps of between $550,000 and $950,000 depending on the state and region. * Australians will be able to buy an additional stake in the home, owned by the federal government, in five per cent increments or pay the government back when they sell. * Homebuyers will avoid lenders mortgage insurance but still need a two per cent deposit and qualify for a standard loan. * Australians with a taxable income of up to $90,000 for individuals and up to $120,000 for couples can access the scheme. * The scheme will cost around $329 million over four years. * Labor will also establish a National Housing Supply and Affordability Council. MEDICINES: * Medication on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will be cut by $12.50, bringing the maximum price of listed medicines to $30. ELECTRIC VEHICLES * Labor will build more electric vehicle charging stations across Australia through a $39.3 million investment, matched by the NRMA. * Up to $80 million to deliver up to 16 hydrogen stations on Australia's busiest freight routes. * Many electric vehicles will be exempt from import tariffs and fringe benefits tax. *Labor will double the Driving the Nation Fund to $500 million, allowing the Commonwealth to co-invest in additional EV chargers, as well as hydrogen and biofuels refuelling infrastructure. MANUFACTURING: * Labor will use $1 billion as part of its $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund to develop value-added products from Australian resources. * Minerals like lithium and nickel used in batteries will be processed in Australia. * One in every 10 jobs on federally funded worksites will be filled by apprentices or trainees. EQUALITY: * Gender pay equity will become an objective of the Fair Work Act. * The Fair Work Commission's powers to order pay increases for workers in low paid, female-dominated industries will be increased.",
  "90ea7d077d78cc24da85610694324a766bdcc6aedb88dc2b6c849584": "Australians have been warned interest rates could rise within two days placing more pressure on millions of homeowners with mortgages.  Economists are mostly convinced the Reserve Bank of Australia could start lifting the cash rate from this week's monthly board meeting, unable to ignore the biggest rise in annual inflation in more than 20 years. Financial markets are fully priced for a 0.15 per cent rise in the cash rate to 0.25 per cent on Tuesday, followed by a series of 0.25 per cent hikes in subsequent months. If correct, it will be the first move in official interest rates since November 2020 and the first increase since November 2010. It would also mark the first hike during an election campaign since 2007, a poll former Liberal prime minister John Howard went on to lose after campaigning on lower interest rates under his government. Prime Minister Scott Morrison is putting on a brave face with his own campaign centring on his government's economic management, saying he fully expects the independent RBA to do what is right for the economy. Economists had been expecting the RBA to hold off until the June board meeting to avoid being tangled up in a political stoush and in which time it would have the benefit of seeing how wages growth is performing. The wage price index for the March quarter is due on May 18, just days out from the May 21 election. But with annual inflation soaring to 5.1 per cent - and underlying inflation jumping to 3.7 per cent and well above the RBA's two to three per cent inflation target - many economists believe the central bank cannot wait any longer. 'On seeing that number our thinking is now that it precludes the 'luxury' of waiting for the additional information on the labour market and the RBA board will have to act on May 3,' Westpac chief economist Bill Evans said. The RBA will also release its quarterly statement on monetary policy on Friday, which will provide its view on the risks facing the economy from here, as well as a new set of economic forecasts. Before then, there will be a deluge of new economic reports to digest, kicking off with CoreLogic's influential home value index for April. House price growth has been slowing after last year's surge with potential home buyers facing stretched affordability, rising fixed-rate mortgages and a tightening in lending criteria. Before Tuesday's RBA board meeting, the weekly ANZ-Roy Morgan consumer confidence index is released, which will capture the response to the inflation figures and the prospect of rising interest rates. Other highlights will be retail sales figures for March on Wednesday, covering a time of rising cost of living pressures, including a spike in petrol prices above $2 a litre. Meanwhile, Australian shares face a tough start to the week after another steep sell-off on Wall Street on Friday as investors continue to fret over the outlook for US interest rates in the fight against inflation. Adding to the biggest monthly decline in the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index since the 2008-2009 global financial crisis was a drop in Amazon shares after posting its first loss since 2015. The S&P 500 fell 155.57 points or 3.5 per cent to 4131.93, the Dow slumped 939.18 points or 2.8 per cent to 32,977.21 and the Nasdaq tumbled 536.89 points or 4.2 per cent to 12,334.64. Australian share futures sank 94 points or 1.3 per cent to 7315. On Friday the Australian benchmark S&P/ASX200 index finished up 78.1 points, or 1.06 per cent to 7435.0.",
  "c806c5709c0ce548107a1681b830567da6c87ce503a78ce23adb4f91": "Scott Morrison has admitted the dream of owning home is not something everyone can achieve. The prime minister made the brutal admission on Sunday as he conceded it was 'really tough' for homebuyers to purchase a property.  'It's really tough, but what I'm so encouraged by is that Australians are still doing it, and the programs we've put in place are helping them achieve that,' he said. 'The most important thing if you want to own your own home is making sure you get that job and you have that financial security.' Mr Morrison later attended a Liberal rally and was joined by minister for foreign affairs Marise Payne and controversial candidate Katherine Deves.  A looming interest rate rise and a new opposition shared equity plan to get thousands of people into homes has intensified the spotlight on property affordability. Federal Labor says the cost of buying a home will be slashed by up to 40 per cent for about 10,000 low to middle income earners a year if it wins government. Responding to the policy on Sunday, Finance Minister Simon Birmingham said the recently expanded Home Guarantee Scheme was preferable to governments owning part of people's homes. 'Our policy is about ensuring that Australians get to own their own home, Labor's policy is about the government owning parts of your home with you,' Mr Birmingham told ABC's Insiders on Sunday. Labor's Help to Buy scheme will provide an equity contribution of up to 40 per cent of the purchase price of a new home, and up to 30 per cent for an existing dwelling, with buyers needing a minimum deposit of two per cent. Ahead of the most recent federal budget, the government announced up to 50,000 places would be available each year under its scheme allowing first home buyers to enter the market with a much smaller deposit. 'It's helping now really lift the rates of first time ownership ... and importantly, you get to own your own home, you don't have Mr Albanese at the kitchen table,' Mr Birmingham said. About 160,000 new home owners entered the Australian market last year, up from a five year average of around 100,000, he said. Under Labor's plan, Australians will be able to buy back an additional stake in the home, owned by the federal government, in five per cent increments or pay the government back when they sell. The scheme is not exclusive to first home buyers but participants must be Australian citizens and live in the home for two years. It's expected to cost taxpayers around $329 million over four years, but the Greens say the investment 'won't even touch the sides'. Leader Adam Bandt said housing affordability is one area the party would push an Albanese Government should Labor win the election. 'What we want to do is work with the next government, which will hopefully not be a Liberal government ... but they're going to need to be pushed,' Mr Bandt told Insiders on Sunday. 'Housing affordability is a massive issue in this country and they come out with a policy that maybe might help 10,000 people, and might in fact push up prices.' The Greens want to build a million homes over the next two decades, including a mix of public and community housing and shared ownership and affordable rental schemes. The debate comes ahead of a meeting of the Reserve Bank on Tuesday to discuss the prospect of a mid-campaign interest rate rise.",
  "2c01f8fa0f01176174290ed73aa9d2f1f59f395ef73ca7ca64cd4ccb": "Scott Morrison has been caught on camera struggling to use an Eftpos machine in footage many Aussies can relate to. Footage of the humourous slip up was screened on Ten's The Project last month, where the program's hosts commentated the clip as it played out on the show. The Prime Minister is seen talking to members of the public in a store selling plants, before using his credit card to purchase pot plants. Mr Morrison struggles to pay for the items as he continuously taps his card on the machine and flips it over. He asks the cashier in the video if he should try and place his card on the machine again and then asks where to place it. 'I've got to do it on the side, or?' he is heard saying as he holds the card to the side of the machine. The cashier instructs the Prime Minister to put the card on the top before cancelling the transaction and restarting the process again.  'Where's Jenny when you need her?' one of the Project co-hosts chimes in as the panel observes the footage of the gaffe. 'Maybe she knows how to use a card.'  The clip of the gaffe playing out on The Project was recorded by a woman and posted to her TikTok account in late April. The account appears to be strongly supportive of Labor and opposition leader Anthony Albanese. 'He has no idea. How can he be so out of touch. Man of the people,' the woman captioned the video.  Many followers of the account shared their surprise over how the Prime Minister was unable to use the machine to pay for the items. 'How does he not know how to use it?' asked one. 'He runs what ...... a country' wrote another. A third added: 'It's obviously 'not his job''. However, some users came to the Prime Minister's defence, claiming that this kind of mistake happens often with consumers, while others theorised that the card was inactive and was only there for the cameras. 'Inactive card used just for the photo shoot,' commented one person. One TikTok user suggested that the Prime Minister was 'asked to use the back of it so the press couldn't get a photo of the card'. 'I think we have all done this. We got scan our card on the screen but it's on the top,' one user said. ",
  "65453e704f5e7badebb7112e5d9f6dd165375ebce827bac4fd8c4cf8": "A mother has claimed Levi Bellfield got her pregnant weeks before he killed Milly Dowler and says she was forced to flee when neighbours threatened to tell her 19-year-old son the truth about his father. Bellfield, 53, is currently serving a life sentence for the murder of 13-year-old schoolgirl Dowler. He was also convicted of murdering Marsha McDonnell, 19, Amelie Delagrange, 22, and the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy, and will never be considered for parole. But now a woman has claimed she was in a relationship with the serial killer and fathered his secret son weeks before Dowler's murder, The Mirror reports. The mother-of-three says she met Bellfield, who was using the alias Levi Taylor, in the queue of a nightclub before driving her home in the red Daewoo Nexia used in Dowler's abduction. She says she fell pregnant following a one-night stand, an evening she describes as 'the mistake of my life', adding that her son remains unaware of her father's identity. The mother said: 'How do you tell your child their father is Britain's most dangerous killer?' Bellfield's name does not appear on her son's birth certificate, but police papers and social services documents are understood to show that the woman alerted authorities to their relationship in 2006 - before he faced court for the heinous crimes. She told police that keeping the secret had caused her to suffer from depression, while she was also forced to flee her home in 2014 when her neighbours threatened to inform her father's identity. The woman, who has not been named, said: 'This is something I've kept a secret for more than 20 years. I've not wanted to talk about it. 'I've kept it quiet for such a long time, I haven't even been able to speak his name. My son is gentle and caring, he's nothing like Levi. 'He's just a gentle boy, he's never asked who his dad is. 'I've always said I would never tell him because I don't want him to carry that around. I don't know what to do. I don't want to lie to my son.' The woman also claimed that, after having sex with Bellfield on her sofa, he told her he had 'always thought about burning schoolgirls with cigarettes'. It was a comment that made the mother think he was trying to gauge her thoughts on becoming 'his Myra Hindley'. But she told him the thoughts were 'horrific' and described Bellfield as 'manipulative'. Bellfield is currently being held within the vulnerable prisoners' unit at HMP Frankland in Durham. He was found guilty of Dowler's murder in 2011, nine years after her death, and sentenced with the recommendation that he never be released from prison. She was snatched from the street while on her way from school to her home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in March 2002.  He was already serving a whole life term for the murder of Ms McDonnell and Ms Delagrange and attempting to murder Ms Sheedy, 18, in 2004, when he went on trial for killing Milly.    The mother said: 'It's something I've got to live with. My son and I are very close, but he doesn't ask about it. 'I've always said that I hoped Levi would die, every year that goes by, because it would make my life easier. 'People have asked me about my son's dad and I just say, 'He's dead, he drove off a cliff '. She added: 'I don't regret what happened with Levi, because I have a son I love. He's nothing like Levi, he's so soft and wouldn't hurt a fly.  'But this is just a big lie I'm carrying around, it's exhausting.'",
  "cda6aca9008dcd80b6f0fcd75b6c3abe46e5fcb7f5d076fba11d88b0": "After torrential rain and flooding caused widespread havoc over swathes of Australia this summer, the wet weather looks stubbornly set to stick around. Dr Karl Kruszelnicki explained that La Nina is working together with other weather systems to create the perfect conditions for heavy rainfall, which could continue until at least late June. Already this year, many towns and cities along the country's east coast have reached their annual rainfall, including Sydney, which by early April had seen at least 1112mm of rain. The average annual rainfall in Sydney is 1164mm, and there is still nine months of the year left go. The deluge also caused devastating flooding in northern NSW. Lismore was particularly hard hit with the entire town submerged and hundreds of homes severely damaged after the Wilsons River broke its bank and reached a peak of about 15metres twice in a month. 'These weather events can be extremely dangerous. People can die. Buildings and infrastructure can be damaged. Just look at Lismore,' Dr Karl told Today on the weekend. He explained that the intense rain is being caused by 'two pools of hot water up against our coast.' 'La Nina on our east coast and on the west coast we have what they call the Indian Ocean Dipole and that is warm so it will evaporate.' The beloved science presenter explained that the hotter water evaporates at a greater rate than normal which then sits in the upper atmosphere - eventually falling back down as rain. Dr Karl said these two system were then combing with a third called the Southern Annular Mode.  'This is basically a bunch of cyclones continuously going around the South Pole'. 'When they get snug in you get blizzards on the Antarctic, when they expand out you get cold weather patterns coming across Australia.' He said this cold air causes low-pressure systems to travel up over Australia.  When this collides with a high pressure-system 'atmospheric rivers' can form which allow water vapor to collect and be transported over vast distances.  With so much moisture already in the air, Dr Karl, said this atmospheric river is what caused the deluge in Brisbane earlier this year and subsequent flooding on the northern NSW coast.  'That dumped eight cubic km of water on Brisbane in three days - that's the equivalent of 16 Sydney harbours.' As for when the rain will finally return to normal, Dr Karl bluntly said 'we're stuck with it in the short term'.  'For a couple of more months at least, it looks like it's going to get worse. Maybe until June then things are up in the air.'  According to the Bureau of Meteorology La Nina will subside in the next few weeks. 'La Nina will ease in strength over the coming months, with a return to neutral ENSO conditions (neither El Nino nor La Nina) most likely in late autumn or early winter,' BoM's climate driver report said in April. But overseas forecasters have painted a different picture saying the system could persist over Australia all the way through winter.  Weatherzone looked at data from the U.S. National Weather Service's Climate Prediction Centre (CPC) and Columbia University's International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI) 'La Nina has a 59 percent chance of continuing through the Southern Hemisphere's winter and a 50 to 55 percent chance of persisting thorough the Southern Hemisphere's spring,' it said. The data also found that this summer's La Nina was among the most powerful since 1950.  Dr Karl added the driving factor behind the stronger than usual La Nina was climate change. 'We can stop and reverse global warming which is the cause of it all we can drop our carbon emissions by 95 per cent in 10 years if we decide to,' he said. 'Whether we decide to or not depends on the influence of the fossil fuel companies. 'We can reverse global warming and bring temperatures back to what they were in the 20th century.' The rain isn't the only climate problem the country is currently facing with warm, dry weather in Australia's red centre sparking fire concerns.  The Alice Springs region's vegetation fuel load is huge and highly flammable after one of the wettest winters on record and a scorching summer. 'In the desert, fire burns where water flows because that's where fuel, in the form of vegetation, is heaviest,' Charles Darwin University fire expert Rohan Fisher said. Parts of Alice Springs were under a watch and act alert over the Easter long weekend, and fires west of the town of 25,000 could be seen from space. Additional fire services have been flown to Alice Springs as a precautionary measure to help mitigate any additional risks. Mr Fisher said even as the weather cooled it was important to be aware that the fuel load and fire risk remained. PERTH Sunday Sunny. Max 25 Monday Mostly sunny. Min 10 Max 24 Tuesday Partly cloudy.

  "165d749021da85dee88b44e323e6711579af67afdc85dc02ef7785b1": "Comedian Trevor Noah mocked the Biden administration for rising inflation rates at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner and also took jabs at Florida Governor Ron DeSantis' possible presidential candidacy after the state banned dozens of math books earlier this month.  The Daily Show Host touted Biden for coming out to the event on Saturday, saying he doesn't know why the president would miss a chance to hear all about his supposed accomplishments.  'You know, I think ever since you've come into office, things are really looking up. Gas is up. Rent is up. Food is up. Everything,' Noah joked about inflation, which is at the highest it's been in 40 years.  Noah also took aim at Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, and used the former Republican president as a gateway to roast DeSantis.   '[If] Trump was the original Terminator, DeSantis is like the T-1000,' Noah said of the Florida governor. 'You're smarter than him, you're slicker than him, you can walk down ramps.   'Because you see, Trump said he won the election, but everyone was just able to look at the numbers and see he was wrong. 'That's why Ron DeSantis is one step ahead,' Noah said, referencing the fact that Florida tossed out 41 percent of the 132 math textbooks submitted for the next school year, more than half of which the state said referenced Critical Race Theory (CRT), with the rest containing Common Core and Social Emotional Learning (SEL).  'First you ban the math textbooks, then nobody knows how to count the votes,' Noah quipped. 'Boom, my man!' At the dinner, Biden poked fun at his own low approval rating and called the Trump administration a 'horrible plague' as he cracked jokes and roasted the press. 'Tonight, we come here to answer a very important question in everybody's mind. Why in hell are we still doing this?' Biden quipped as he took the stage in the room full of journalists and D.C. insiders.  'I know there are questions about whether we should gather here tonight because of COVID. Well, we're here to show the country that we're getting through this pandemic. Plus, everyone had to prove they're fully vaccinated and boosted,' he said. 'Just contact your favorite Fox News reporter they're all here vaccinated and boosted.' He then addressed his historically low poll numbers for the first time, claiming that journalists were the only people who were less well-liked.  'I'm really excited to be here tonight with the only group of Americans have a lower approval rating than I have,' Biden said.  President Joe Biden kicked off the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner on Saturday with his own quips about his administration and his political rivals.   'I'm really excited to be here tonight with the only group of Americans have a lower approval rating than I have,' Biden, who FiveThiryEight's latest poll has him at a 41.7 approval rating, told the journalists, celebrities and politicians attending the event. 'Well, that's hard to say after what we just saw this the first time President attended this dinner in six years.' 'Well that's understandable - we had a horrible plague, followed by two years of COVID,' the president added.  'Imagine if my predecessor came to this dinner this year. Now that would really have been a real coup that occurred,' Biden said, taking jabs at the January 6 Capitol riot. 'Folks, I'm not really here to roast the GOP. That's not my style. Besides, there's nothing I can say about the GOP that Kevin McCarthy hasn't already put on tape,' Biden quipped, referencing the leaked tapes of the House Minority leader saying he would ask former President Donald Trump to resign after January 6. 'At the same time, a lot of people say the Republican Party's too extreme too divisive to control by one person. They say that's not your father's Republican Party. Ronald Reagan said Mr. Gorbachev, tear this wall down. Today's Republicans say 'Tear down Mickey Mouse's house.'  And pretty soon they'll be storming Cinderella's castle. You can be sure that Republicans seem to support one fella. Some guy named Brandon. He's having a really good year. I'm kind of happy for him,' Biden said, referring to conservative rallying cry 'Let's Go Brandon.'  'Well, that's hard to say after what we just saw this the first time President attended this dinner in six years.' 'Well that's understandable - we had a horrible plague, followed by two years of COVID,' the president added.  'Imagine if my predecessor came to this dinner this year. Now that would really have been a real coup that occurred!' Biden then turned his attention to Republicans, and the leaked tapes of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy claiming he would ask President Trump to resign after January 6. 'Folks, I'm not really here to roast the GOP. That's not my style. Besides, there's nothing I can say about the GOP that Kevin McCarthy hasn't already put on tape,' Biden said to a room full of chuckles.  'At the same time, a lot of people say the Republican Party's too extreme too divisive to control by one person. They say that's not your father's Republican Party. Ronald Reagan said Mr. Gorbachev, tear this wall down. Today's Republicans say 'Tear down Mickey Mouse's house.'  And pretty soon they'll be storming Cinderella's castle. You can be sure that Republicans seem to support one fella. Some guy named Brandon. He's having a really good year. I'm kind of happy for him,' Biden said, referring to conservative rallying cry 'Let's Go Brandon.'  Biden then introduced Noah, who is headlining the event, who mocked the large maskless gathering.   It is my great honor to be speaking tonight at the nation's most distinguished super spreader events,' Noah said. 'No for real people. What are we doing here? Let's be honest. What are we doing? Like did none of you learn anything from the Grid Iron Dinner?'  Dozens of high-profile attendees tested positive for Covid-19 after attending the exclusive media event weeks earlier.   'Do you read any of your own newspapers? I mean, I expect this from Sean Hannity, but the rest of you What are you doing?,' he added.  'I spent the last two years telling everyone the importance of wearing masks and avoiding large indoor gatherings. Then the second someone offers you a free dinner you'll turn into Joe Rogan. I mean, Dr. Fauci dropped out,' Noah said. 'That should have been a pretty big sign. Fauci thought it was too dangerous to come tonight. Pete Davidson thinks it's okay,' Noah said, pointing to Kim Kardashian's date.  Kardashian and Davidson were among the biggest celebrities at the event, with other stars of note including Drew Barrymore, Martha Stewart, Chris Tucker, Michael Keaton and billionaire Melidna Gates.  Noah then turned his focus to the president.   'As you all know, President Biden's lack of a filter does get him into hot water sometimes, you know, last month he caused a huge international incidents saying that Vladimir Putin should be removed from power was very, very upsetting to Russia,' Noah said.  'So someone explained to them that none of the stuff Biden wants actually gets done.' In late March Biden made waves by proclaiming Russian Leader Vladimir Putin 'cannot remain in power,' remarks that the Kremlin replayed on state TV airwaves as a personal attack on Russia.  Noah then turned his attention to White House press secretary Jen Psaki, who is reportedly in negotiations with MSNBC for a contract after she soon leaves the White House.  'The word on the streets is actually that Jen Psaki is going to MSNBC next month. Yeah. Yeah, apparently just being on C-SPAN the ratings are too high. And she wanted more of a challenge, you know, want to switch things up? She can't laugh at that. Don't put the camera on her.'  'You know, moving to MSNBC is going to be a big switch for you because right now your current job is to make the Biden administration looks as good as possible, you know, at all costs. Now you're going to be at MSNBC and you're going to have to .... you'll be fine actually,' he quipped.  'By the way MSNBC Can I just say you guys are doing great work. I love watching your shows you know when Trump was in office, your shows were all about how bad he was. And now that Biden's in office, your shows are all about how bad Trump was. Consistency is important.'  Noah then poked fun at CNN's Jeffrey Toobin, who was caught masturbating on a work call.  'We're celebrating without you don't get comfortable. Not too comfortable, Jeffrey Toobin, not too comfortable,' Noah said. 'No, you know what? No, don't don't do him a bunch of haters. You know what? So what Jeffrey, you made a mistake. You whipped it out in front of your coworkers.' 'Where is Jeffrey Zucker?' Noah asked, referring to CNN's former head, who left after it was revealed he was having a relationship with a colleague.  'Jeff got fired off because he tried to keep his workplace relationship secret, which is weird, because if he really didn't want anyone to know about him, he could have just made a show about it on CNN Plus!'  'I know I know. It's so sad. CNN Plus gone, but forgotten,' Noah added, referring to CNN's now-failed streaming venture.  'I blame John King. That's true. Yeah, John, your magic wall can predict how every person in the country is going to vote in every county, but it couldn't give you a heads up that nobody wanted more CNN,' Noah added.  He then turned his attention to CNN's gratuitous use of the 'Breaking News' banner.  'My man over there, Chris, as the new head of news. His first order of business hire guy who knows how to turn off the breaking news banner. What happened with that they just put it on during the OJ chase and then never figured out how to get rid of it? The news is not always breaking!' Noah also directed his wise cracks at Fox News, as he turned to the White House press corps: 'Everyday you demand answers on the pressing issues of the day. And then Fox News asked about Hunter Biden. And I'll be honest, though, I actually think that's a good thing. I really do. I think people need to be held accountable if they're using their dad's name to get ahead in life. I can't think of anyone better to ask about that than Peter Doocy.' Doocy's prominent role with the channel came after his father Steve Doocy joined the channel.  He then turned his attention to primetime host Sean Hannity, who is dating Fox host Ainsley Earhardt. 'Sean Hannity and Ainsley Earhart's actually dating now. Yes. And I actually think it's beautiful to see an office romance of folks that won't enter the $20 million settlement. Yeah. I'm sure whoever Roger Ailes is right now. He's looking up and smiling.'  'Laura Ingram - wow. What can you say about her that hasn't already been said by the anti-Defamation League?' Noah added. Then came Tucker Carlson.  'Tucker Carlson Are you kidding me? I mean, he's a beast who else could fill an entire show each night asking questions that Google could easily answer. 'Do vaccines work? Who really won the election? Who is the president right now? Is this America?' Noah said.  The comedian also took a minute to thank the reporters in the room for their duty as the fourth estate to make sure those in power are held accountable by the people, and noted that being able to roast a sitting president was a luxury afforded to him by America's freedoms.  'I stood here tonight and I made fun of the President of the United States, and I'm going to be fine,' Noah said.  But, he made one last dig at Biden as he concluded the evening, referencing the U.S.'s frenzied withdrawal from Afghanistan.    'Please be careful leaving tonight. This administration doesn't handle evacuations. Well. Good night, everybody.' ",
  "782d50ca81f4ab5167306557047c2091a15dd9cc0fd02251d07d8f6c": "The wife of a former U.S. Marine who was killed while fighting alongside Ukrainian forces against Russia has seen her life 'completely fall apart' since she received the news of her husband's death.  On Monday, Willy Joseph Cancel of Orange County New York, 22, was killed in Ukraine after he was deployed there by a private military contracting company.  In a GoFundMe post, his father, Willy Cancel, wrote that his 22-year-old widow, Brittany Cancel's - who is also a Marine veteran - she received 'the worst call of her life' the next day, when she was informed that her husband was killed on the battlefield. 'Your husband fought bravely but unfortunately he did not make it,' she was told, Willy Cancel wrote.       'Since that April 26th phone call, her life has completely fallen apart and now she has to figure out how to build it back together, to figure out how to raise her son without his father or financial support,' the father wrote on GoFundMe.  'As a family, we are trying to support them as much as possible and be there for each other, but Brittany and Anthony will need more than what we can provide.' As of Saturday evening, the fundraiser has garnered over $63,000 toward supporting Cancel's wife and his seven-month-old son.  'He will grow up without a father, a father who was brave and selfless and whose life was senselessly lost,' Cancel's father wrote about his grandson, Anthony. 'While he will grow knowing that his father died a hero, we know this will not be easy. No parent should ever have to bury their child, and no child should have to grow up without a parent.' Cancel's mother, Rebecca Cabrera, said her son was working for a private military contracting company when he agreed to take up a job to fight in the Ukraine following Russia's invasion in February.  'He wanted to go over because he believed in what Ukraine was fighting for, and he wanted to be a part of it to contain it there so it didn't come here, and that maybe our American soldiers wouldn't have to be involved in it,' Cabrera told CNN.  The circumstances of Cancel's death remain unclear, including how and where he was killed.  His mother added that those fighting alongside Cancel were not able to retrieve his body during the conflict that killed him.  'They haven't found his body,' she said. 'They are trying, the men that were with him, but it was either grab his body or get killed, but we would love for him to come back to us.'  The family said Cancel was living in Tennessee working as a corrections officer when he flew to Poland on March 12 and crossed into Ukraine.  Cabrera told CNN that her son was joined by men from 'all different countries' to assist the Ukrainian troops.  'It was something that he believed in his heart, that was the right thing,' Cabrera said. 'He was the type of man who always stepped up when everybody else stepped back, and there were a lot of men who were like that that were with him.' Cancel's brother-in-law, Devin Tietze, echoed Cabrera's remarks, saying that Cancel was the 'type to fight for what's right regardless of the outcome.'  'He believed wholeheartedly this shouldn't have happened and he wanted to go help the people in Ukraine,' Tietze told CNN. Previously, Cancel  was stations at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina and served as a rifleman in the Marines. He was never deployed to a war zone, and was discharged for bad conduct after violating a lawful general order, according to Marine Corps spokesman Major Jim Stenger.' The U.S. State Department said they were aware of the reports of Cancel's death but could not comment based on privacy matters.   The Department reiterated in a statement that: 'US citizens should not travel to Ukraine due to the active armed conflict and the singling out of US citizens in Ukraine by Russian government security officials, and that US citizens in Ukraine should depart immediately if it is safe to do so, using any commercial or other privately available ground transportation options.'  It is not known how many U.S. citizens are actively assisting Ukrainian troops in the war, but the Ukrainian Defense Ministry estimates that more than 20,000 volunteer veterans from 52 countries have joined the fight.  The influx of foreign fighters has led the Ukranian government to create the special International Legion, composed of the visiting veterans allied with the country.   Cancel is not the first American to die in the Ukraine as a result of the bloody war.  Jimmy Hill, 67, of Idaho, was gunned down in the streets of Ukraine while buying bread when he refused to leave the warzone because he was looking after his sick partner.  Hill was a lecturer in Kyiv but was in Chernihiv to care for his partner Ira, who has multiple sclerosis. They had returned to the country in December so Ira, who is Ukrainian, could be treated for MS, and became trapped at a regional hospital there.   Hill was among a group of 10 who were lining up to buy bread at a grocery store when Russian troops opened fire in a sickening act of war. Hill's death came just a few days after American journalist and freelance filmmaker Brent Renaud, 50, was shot dead by Russian troops while filming refugees in the Ukraine.  Renaud was in a car with other journalists in Irpin when Putin's troops opened fire. He was fatally-shot in the neck, with one of his colleagues also injured.  Although Renaud was carrying a New York Times press badge at the time of his death, he was in fact working as a freelancer on a global film about refugees commissioned by Time magazine's studio division. Renaud's death was announced by Andrey Nebitov, the head of Kyiv's police department, who said he paid 'with his life for trying to highlight the aggressor's ingenuity, cruelty and ruthlessness.' ",
  "76b9e0365d08eebaced18c5c168ef97745ab995a2327e9d3df834bc2": "Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova slammed Pentagon press secretary John Kirby and said he's 'losing his nerve' in his comments over Putin's invasion of Ukraine.  Kirby delivered an emotional condemnation of Vladimir Putin's 'depravity' in Ukraine on Friday, and came close to tears as he described the horror of looking at images coming from the war-torn country. Zakharova, who has served as Moscow's foreign ministry spokesperson since 2015, called Kirby's statement 'rude, insulting and troublesome' in a post on Telegram.  She added that Kirby 'said some nonsense' about Russian President Putin.  'Among other gibberish, he said it was 'hard to look at what Russian forces are doing in Ukraine.' Really? How hard can it be for an American rear admiral to look at anything?' she asked.  Kirby has yet to respond to Zakharova's statement.  The Pentagon press secretary has won rave reviews for his unflappable manner and dry sense of humor during briefings, delivering grim news with the minimum of fuss. But on Friday, the toll of 65 days of war in Ukraine caught up with him when he was asked about President Putin's state of mind.  'I'm not going to go into the psychology of Vladimir Putin,' he began. 'It's hard to look at what he's doing in Ukraine, what his forces are doing in Ukraine and think that any ethical, moral individual could justify that.  'It's difficult to look at the...' He tailed off, apparently choking up and battling to regain his composure. After a few seconds, he resumed his train of thought and delivered one of his most powerful condemnations yet of the Russian president.  'Sorry,' he said. 'It's difficult to look at some of the images and imagine that any well-thinking, serious mature leader would do that.  'So I can't talk to his psychology. But I think we can all speak to his depravity.' Earlier the retired rear admiral announced that the U.S. had begun training Ukrainian soldiers on key weapons systems at bases in Germany. The U.S. and partners are pouring in weapons in a race against time before Russia launches its full onslaught against Ukrainian forces in the eastern Donbas region. U.S. officials - including Kirby - have already accused Russian forces of war crimes. After his emotional words, he was asked why had used the term 'depravity' and what had pushed him into such powerful condemnation. 'I can't speak for the entire US government. I speak for the Defense Department and I didn't mean to get emotional,' he said. 'I apologize for that. I don't want to make this about me. 'But I've been around the military a long, long time and I've known friends who didn't make it back. It's just hard.' Then he listed Russian actions in Ukraine, including killing civilians, and asked how it was related to Putin's war aims. His tearful moment gave way to furious indignation. 'And it's hard to it's hard to square his - let's just call it what it is - BS that this is about Nazism in Ukraine, and it's about protecting Russians in Ukraine, and it's about defending Russian national interests when none of them ... none of them were threatened by Ukraine,' he said, thumping the lectern to emphasize his fury.  'It's hard to square that rhetoric by what he's actually doing inside Ukraine to innocent people shot in the back of the head, hands tied behind their backs.  'Women, pregnant women being killed hospitals being bombed. 'I mean, it's just unconscionable. And I don't know, I don't have the mental capacity to understand how you get how you connect those two things. It's just beyond me.' The International Criminal Court and at least nine countries have launched war crimes investigations. Some of the worst atrocities have been identified around Kyiv after the Kremlin's troops pulled out early in April. Investigators have described signs of torture and mutilation on bodies left in the streets of Bucha and have uncovered mass graves. 'I don't think we fully appreciated the degree to which he would visit that kind of violence and cruelty and as I said depravity on innocent people, on non-combatants on civilians, with such such utter disregard for the lives he was taking,' said Kirby.  'I mean, there's not even there's not even an attempt by Russia to be precise in their targeting.' Even if you could justify the war, he continued, it was impossible to justify the war it was being conducted.  'It's just ... it's brutality of the coldest and and most depraved sort.' he said. Earlier news emerged of the latest shipments of weapons to Ukraine. More than a dozen flights will leave the continental U.S. in the next 24 hours carrying weapons destined for Ukrainian armed forces, including more howitzers and the first of the new Phoenix Ghost drones. A senior defense official told reporters that the new, secret drones will join 100 Switchblades - kamikaze drones that carry a warhead - that have already been delivered. It comes as Russia on Thursday pounded targets across Ukraine, hitting high-rise apartments in Kyiv, just when the capital was beginning a return to normal. And as the Pentagon announced it had begun training some Ukrainian forces at bases in Germany on key weapons systems. U.S. officials have suggested they face a race against time to deliver weapons to Ukrainian forces as they fight fierce battles in the eastern Donbas region.  Last week, President Joe Biden announced he was giving them a new weapon - previously classified Phoenix Ghost drones specially tailored for the conflict. 'In the next 24 hours, more than a dozen flights are expected from the continental United States and that will include howitzers, more 155 rounds, Some of those Phoenix ghost UAVs and and even some of the radars that we talked about,' said a defense official. Little is known about the unmanned aerial vehicle, or drone.   It is manufactured by AEVEX Aerospace. However, the company is known for modifying drones and providing flight training, suggesting the Phoenix Ghost could be based on a commercially available aircraft. The company did not respond to a request for more information. However, U.S. officials have previously described it as a 'one-way drone' that 'delivers a punch,' leading analysts to say it might operate like a Switchblade, which can loiter over a target before crashing into it with an explosive payload. The official said training of Ukrainian troops in the new weapon had not yet started.  'We believe that the first tranche of those drones should be arriving in the region today, but not all 121. the first tranche of them will be arriving in the region today,' said the official at Friday's briefing.  'And again, we're still working out the how the specific training is going to be done on this. We do believe that training will not take very long for for pilots that have some existing UAV knowledge.'  ",

Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrew said last week the timing of Beijing's security deal with the Solomon Islands was significant and Beijing was 'clearly aware' Australia was in the middle of a federal election. 'We talk about political interference and that has many forms so I think we need to be very much aware of what Beijing is doing,' she said. Labor took aim at the minister with campaign spokesman Jim Chalmers saying her comments were 'remarkably desperate and remarkably unhinged'. Finance Minister Simon Birmingham told Sky News on Sunday the comments were legitimate. 'We have known that foreign interference is a real risk in the Australian electorate landscape and in Australian politics generally,' he said. 'It's why we as a government put in place foreign interference laws as part of a range of different protections we have applied to Australia in response to the more aggressive and assertive stance of China and indeed other risks over recent years.' Asked whether interference was occurring, he said: 'That will be a matter for our intelligence analysts and others who would be no doubt monitoring these matters very closely.' 'We have seen enormous hostility in the commentary from elements of the Chinese communist party and their mouthpiece organs in Beijing towards this government,' he said. 'We want to fight this election on the policies as they matter to Australia. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has described a possible Chinese military base in the Solomons as a 'red line', but is taking the Solomon Islands government at its word that no such base is intended. Senator Birmingham said such a base 'may necessitate other basing or operational decisions that the US or other partner countries might need to make into the future'. 'We will continue to work with Prime Minister Sogavare and others across the Pacific and we acknowledge his public statements and ongoing commitments that there will not be foreign military bases established in the Solomon Islands. 'And we will continue to provide the record levels of assistance.' Asked how a Labor government would approach China, foreign affairs spokeswoman Penny Wong said it was a matter of 'sensibly, calmly, and consistently' managing differences in values and interests. 'The reality is we had a prime minister who dropped the ball when it came to the Pacific ... we will seek to (work) consistently and calmly,' she told the ABC. 'We have to work with all sovereign nations in our region.' The news comes as the Labor Party holds its official campaign launch at the Optus Stadium in Perth. WA Labor Premier Mark McGowan introduced Labor leader Anthony Albanese  'the next prime minister of Australia' at the event on Sunday as insiders say the party is confident it can win three Liberal-held WA seats in the upcoming Federal Election.. The premier on Sunday praised Mr Albanese's understanding of the state's important resources and highlighting his own government's track record in managing the Covid pandemic. He added that WA had produced two of the nation's greatest citizens in wartime - prime ministers John Curtin and Bob Hawke, the latter having told him 'he always identified as a Western Australian'. 'We know that it is Labor governments that best manage our economy and responsibly manage our finances,' Mr McGowan said. Labor has sought to present Mr McGowan and his federal counterpart as close allies, playing down past visits to WA by Mr Albanese in which the pair did not publicly appear together. Mr McGowan described Mr Albanese as resilient, authentic and one of the most experienced political figures in the nation. 'He is a fundamentally decent person, driven by empathy and a deep sense of civic responsibility,' Mr McGowan said. 'I have every confidence he will make a fine prime minister.' Labor leader Anthony Albanese has unveiled new policies on health, housing and equality as he launched the party's campaign in Perth. HOUSING MEDICINES ELECTRIC VEHICLES MANUFACTURING EQUALITY",
  "9218d2ca847ac736a0ac97882626b085da09c81c2e12410e265509b3": "Footy legend Dustin Martin's father Shane was facing charges in New Zealand for violently attacking a woman in her bedroom at the time of his death. The former Rebels bikie boss was found dead last December, in the kitchen of his Mount Maunganui home, 200km south east of Auckland, due to suspected natural causes.  The 54-year-old, who had a number of minor drug convictions, was deported from Australia in 2016 under 'character' grounds due to his affiliation with the notorious gang.  He spent his final years running a local trucking business after a series of failed legal attempts to reunite with family across the Tasman, where he had lived most of his adult life.  It has now emerged Martin was facing active criminal charges of male assaults female, strangulation, burglary and illegal possession of steroids after allegedly attacking a woman known to him in October, the New Zealand Herald reports. Shortly before his death, Martin appeared in the Tauranga District Court in November, where he pleaded not guilty to all charges. Martin and the woman had been in an 'intermittent relationship' dating back to 2020, court documents obtained by the New Zealand Herald show. The assault allegedly occurred on an early Saturday morning in October last year. The alleged victim was out socialising with friends, but she ignored several phone calls from Martin. She later returned home to find Martin in her bed after he snuck into the house. After requesting Martin leave, he called her a 'slut' and accused her of 'whoring around' before allegedly punching her in the face. Police allege he also threw her around the bedroom, grabbed her by the neck and squeezed, and bit her finger.  The woman called 111 after Martin left, with the responding officer noticing she had a swollen, bloodied lip and slight redness on her neck. The police officer reported that Martin called her phone several times during that time which left her 'visibly shaken', but the woman declined to make a formal complaint over the incident.  However, police decided to prosecute Martin anyway 'because of the transcript of the 111 call, and the injuries to the alleged victim,' according to a police spokesperson.  When police charged Martin, they found empty vials of steroids at his address, with court documents saying he admitted to using steroids to increase muscle mass.  Martin told detectives he left the house after a heated argument with the woman, but 'he would never hurt her'.  Police declined to comment on the case due to privacy grounds. 'However, in general we can confirm where matters are prosecuted in line with the Solicitor-General's guidelines, the victim is informed of case developments as the investigation progresses,' the spokesperson told the New Zealand Herald. 'Some victims are pressured to withdraw by the suspect or other parties, however, police seek to obtain evidence early and put measures in place to ensure victims are supported through the prosecution process. 'Victims are at the centre of what we do. Police encourage anyone who has concerns for themselves or someone they know, or is in a situation where they feel unsafe, to get in touch with police.' Lawyer Hannah Stuart, representing the alleged victim, said her client 'did not support the prosecution' but declined to comment further.   Dustin, one of Australia's biggest sporting stars, last saw his father last April. The Richmond Tigers superstar shared a close bond with his father, who was infamously a top-ranking official in the Rebels outlaw bikie gang.  The pair had not seen each other for 12 months prior to that visit because of travel restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic. 'It's been a massive challenge, but it is what it is' Dustin said in March. 'I love my dad and he's made me the man I am today. I've got full belief he'll back here to watch us win another flag. 'That's my dream to be able to have the old man up there (in the grandstand) with the rest of my family and watch the Tigers win another flag.' Martin spent almost three decades in Australia after migrating as a 20-year-old, later marrying Kathy Knight and having three sons, Dustin, Bronson, and Tyson.  In 2015, the Australian government introduced a policy to deport anyone sentenced to more than 12 months in prison or convicted of child sex offences.  The legislation also allows residents to be booted out on 'character grounds' if they have gang links or pose a risk to national security.  Martin, one of thousands of deportees under the 501 immigration act, made several unsuccessful appeals to return to Australia. ",
  "57b93039fddffae10c23a11db54f5b3bbe6830a4d9b2abb2cbf58b7c": "It's the sanger mantrap which has butchered careers at home and abroad - and Labor leader Anthony Albanese diced with political death on Saturday when he awkwardly tackled a sausage sandwich on camera.  On the campaign trail in Perth, the image of the Opposition Leader tucking into the snag roll sparked flashbacks to his predecessor, Bill Shorten. On the day of the 2016 federal election, Mr Shorten horrified a nation when he launched into a roll and sausage from the side, instead of the traditional end first approach. The image, from Strathfield North Public School in Sydney's inner-west, quickly went viral on social media, with many saying it helped Labor lose that election. But Mr Shorten wasn't the first politician to have their eating style critiqued.  In the UK, then Labour leader Ed Miliband was photographed in 2014 devouring a bacon sandwich when out buying flowers for his wife. The image became legendary after it appeared on the front page of a national UK newspaper, destroying his credibility among the British public.  Miliband later resigned as Britain's Labour Party leader after being defeated by Tory Prime Minister David Cameron in the general election. London Evening Standard photographer Jeremy Selwyn snapped the now infamous images, and knew he had struck gold. 'As soon as anybody famous starts to eat in front of you, as a photographer you start switching on immediately,' he told the Huff Post. 'It's obvious that it's not your glamour shot.' In 2019, the then-Greens leader Richard Di Natale was photographed 'attacking' a sausage with gusto - complete with toppings including mustard, onions and tomato sauce. The image, from federal election day in Melbourne at St Kilda, became a hit online due to Di Natale's clear enthusiasm for the snag - but he still lost his leadership role the following year. Albanese will be hoping he doesn't suffer a similar fate to the previous political sandwich-lovers of the past at the Australian federal election on May 21.",
  "d39bd79b2fafc8a510fb8ecf2e466fce8b9e987a1273243318437761": "Anthony Albanese has positioned Labor as better than the Coalition on climate, housing and health, as the party held its campaign launch in Perth. The pitch came as Prime Minister Scott Morrison returned to the issue of online safety, as he sought to shore up and win Sydney seats. Mr Albanese said the May 21 election was a choice between 'shaping the future or being shaped by it'.   The launch at Perth's Optus Stadium included new promises on cheaper medicines, electric vehicle charging stations and equity for first home buyers. 'This government has had a decade in office and in another three years the problems we need to fix will be even bigger,' Mr Albanese said. 'We can do better.'   Before Labor's official campaign launch, Mr Albanese posed for a photo with his son Nathan, 21, in a rare public appearance. Housing is likely to be a hot topic this week with the Reserve Bank widely expected to lift the cash rate on Tuesday, for the first time in 12 years. Labor's Help to Buy scheme will provide an equity contribution of as much as 40 per cent of the purchase price of a new home and up to 30 per cent for an existing dwelling for 10,000 Australians. The scheme will enable savings up to $380,000 for new homes and $285,000 for existing ones, with price caps of between $550,000 and $950,000 depending on the state and region.  However, Mr Morrison said the approach was flawed. 'They (the Labor government) will have equity in your home and as that your equity goes up, they're gonna keep it,' he said. Labor leader Anthony Albanese has unveiled new policies on health, housing and equality as he launched the party's campaign in Perth. HOUSING: * The Help to Buy scheme will provide an equity contribution of as much as 40 per cent of the purchase price of a new home and up to 30 per cent for an existing dwelling for 10,000 Australians. * The scheme enables savings of up to $380,000 for new homes and $285,000 for existing ones, with price caps of between $550,000 and $950,000 depending on the state and region. * Australians will be able to buy an additional stake in the home, owned by the federal government, in five per cent increments or pay the government back when they sell. * Homebuyers will avoid lenders mortgage insurance but still need a two per cent deposit and qualify for a standard loan. * Australians with a taxable income of up to $90,000 for individuals and up to $120,000 for couples can access the scheme. * The scheme will cost around $329 million over four years. * Labor will also establish a National Housing Supply and Affordability Council. MEDICINES: * Medication on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will be cut by $12.50, bringing the maximum price of listed medicines to $30. ELECTRIC VEHICLES * Labor will build more electric vehicle charging stations across Australia through a $39.3 million investment, matched by the NRMA. * Up to $80 million to deliver up to 16 hydrogen stations on Australia's busiest freight routes. * Many electric vehicles will be exempt from import tariffs and fringe benefits tax. *Labor will double the Driving the Nation Fund to $500 million, allowing the Commonwealth to co-invest in additional EV chargers, as well as hydrogen and biofuels refuelling infrastructure. MANUFACTURING: * Labor will use $1 billion as part of its $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund to develop value-added products from Australian resources. * Minerals like lithium and nickel used in batteries will be processed in Australia. * One in every 10 jobs on federally funded worksites will be filled by apprentices or trainees. EQUALITY: * Gender pay equity will become an objective of the Fair Work Act. * The Fair Work Commission's powers to order pay increases for workers in low paid, female-dominated industries will be increased.   Labor also one-upped the coalition on medicines, announcing drugs on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will cost a maximum of $30, with a $12.50 reduction for general patients.   Gender pay equity will become an objective in the Fair Work Act and there will be more electric-vehicle charging stations. More broadly, Mr Albanese said Labor would bring the principles of universal, affordable and quality service to child care and aged care. 'For too long, our youngest Australians and our oldest Australians and their families have lived with broken systems ... I will make it the Labor government's mission to fix this.' Mr Morrison announced the coalition's blueprint to improve online safety, an issue he also intends to take up - if re-elected - at a global level at the G20 summit in Bali later in the year. Big tech will be required to build enhanced safety controls into their devices that are easy for parents to use and hard for children to bypass. The eSafety Commissioner would work with Apple, Samsung and others to design device settings and a binding code under the Online Safety Act. If the industry does not create these controls within 12 months of the government being returned, it would move to force companies to comply with regulations.  On broader economic issues, asked what the Coalition would do about rising grocery prices, Mr Morrison said he had already halved the petrol tax, provided cash payments to pensioners and implemented an income tax break to start on July 1. He said the war on Europe and the ongoing impact on supply chains of the Covid pandemic were key pressures on inflation. 'The Labor Party think they have some kind of Harry Potter wand that you can just raise in government and it changes the price of a lettuce - it's ridiculous,' Mr Morrison said. 'That shows a complete lack of understanding of what is driving prices.' Mr Morrison held a local campaign rally in the seat of Reid, as Liberal strategists fear the loss of a swathe of seats in Sydney to Labor and independent candidates. An average of the most recent opinion polls puts Labor on 54 per cent of the two-party preferred vote - which if replicated on election day would deliver a comfortable majority. Mr Morrison and Mr Albanese will take part in the second leaders' debate on May 8.",

Brandy Dowdy, 39, was arrested and charged with manslaughter after her dogs allegedly committed multiple attacks on local residents, including the deadly one Friday. She's being held without bail, AL.com reports.  Jacqueline Summer Beard, 58, was responding to a separate dog attack that had happened in the area just a day earlier.  Beard arrived at the home along Route 11 in Alabama, about 120 miles east of Birmingham, on Friday morning. That's when Sheriff Shannon Oliver says those same exact dogs attacked and killed Beard.   Authorities found her body while investigating on Crumpton Road after receiving reports of a suspicious vehicle near the residence at 6pm on Friday.  When they got to the scene, those same dogs attacked again and Dowdy allegedly began attacking people, leaving one person with minor injuries. Dowdy was then arrested. Oliver said there were seven dogs, some of which have already been euthanized.  Beard had worked for the Alabama Department of Public Health for nearly 17 years and was most recently an environmentalist supervisor in multiple counties.   'The Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) extends our deepest sympathy to the family, friends, and colleagues of Summer Beard, after her tragic passing,' Ryan Easterling, the director of the ADPH's Health Media and Communications Division, said in a statement.  'Summer was known to her coworkers as an exceptional person. She was a tremendous team worker and was loved by those who knew her,' Easterling added.

  "43aea968beeccf3dead64989f66dc68e3a8fdb216f8088b6c322ed85": "Australian pets won't be raking up their own air miles anytime soon despite changes to aviation regulations allowing them to fly inside plane cabins with their owners. Last December, Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) changed its regulations to allow pets to sit with their owners in the passenger cabin - if the airline allowed it. Back when the issue was first up for debate in July, 2021, Virgin was the only airline that said it was considering the pets' upgrade from cargo to cabin. However, it's been six months, and none of Australia's three major airlines - Qantas, Virgin, and Jetstar - have shown signs of changing their pet policies. At the time of discussion CASA spokesman Peter Gibson said it would be up to the airlines to ensure pets and people were travelling safely together on flights. 'If they're going to do it, they're going to have to do it safely, and they'll have to show us how they're going to be able to do it safely,' he said. Public opinion has remained divided on the subject, with some travellers keen to bring their furry family members along while others are concerned about allergies and aggressive behaviour. Mr Gibson told ABC the CASA's updated regulations were too broad for airlines to uniformly implement. 'It just talks about animals -- so theoretically, it could be a boa constrictor,' he said. 'At a serious level, you've got people who can be highly allergic to animals, so you've got to take that into account. 'Some people get bad asthma, so that's a serious issue. Other people just get freaked out by snakes.' In order for airlines to meet safety regulations and introduce pets in cabins, they would need to ensure pets do not block cabin aisles or exit rows. The airlines would also need to have procedures in place so that the pets can be properly restrained during an emergency. This could mean small pets would be required to sit on the passenger's lap or remain in a carrier throughout the flight, while bigger pets could need a whole extra seat of their own. Service dogs are currently required to have a 'moisture absorbent mat' during cabin flights so it's likely airlines would choose the mats to also address other animals' bathroom needs. Several European countries already allow cats and dogs that weigh less than 6kg to fly in the passenger cabin.  However Mr Gibson said it seems airlines aren't 'bothered' to go to the effort of creating new procedures just so pets can have a more luxurious ride. All three major airlines currently allow service dogs - including guide dogs, hearing dogs, and assistance dogs - to fly in the passenger cabin. Service dogs must adhere to a series of restrictions while flying that include wearing a harness, holding the proper qualifications for flying, and remaining restrained during the flight.  However emotional support dogs are still up for debate, with Virgin allowing them in the cabin on flights to and from the US while Jetstar confines them to cargo.   Virgin Virgin only allows cats and dogs under 65kg (including the weight of their carry crate) to travel in cargo.  Qantas Qantas allows a broad range of animals to travel in cargo including cats, dogs, guinea pigs, rabbits, some domestic fish, and domestic birds  Jetstar Jetstar redirects customers looking to travel with pets to Qantas, saying it 'is not equipped' to transport animals  ",

The popular WA premier on Sunday introduced Mr Albanese as 'the next prime minister of Australia' at Labor's election campaign launch in Perth. Labor insiders remain confident the party can win three Liberal-held WA seats - Swan, Pearce and Hasluck - at the May 21 poll. It would take a reversal of the party's poor recent track record in a state that has long been a federal coalition stronghold. Federal Labor has sought to capitalise on the strong popularity of Mr McGowan, whose government last year won re-election in one of the most one-sided results in the nation's history. The premier on Sunday said Mr Albanese understood the resources-rich state's importance to Australia's prosperity, highlighting his own government's track record in managing the COVID-19 pandemic. He said WA had produced two of the nation's greatest citizens in wartime - prime ministers John Curtin and Bob Hawke, the latter having told him 'he always identified as a Western Australian'. 'We know that it is Labor governments that best manage our economy and responsibly manage our finances,' Mr McGowan said. Labor has sought to present Mr McGowan and his federal counterpart as close allies, playing down past visits to WA by Mr Albanese in which the pair did not publicly appear together. It has reminded voters the Morrison government initially supported billionaire Clive Palmer's challenge of WA's hard border. The federal government withdrew its intervention after facing backlash in WA, and the High Court ultimately ruled against Mr Palmer. 'Just imagine where we would be, where Western Australia would be ... if the Liberals and Nationals, and their fellow traveller Clive Palmer had been successful in their efforts to undermine our hard work,' Mr McGowan said. The premier said a decision by the Liberals to send preferences to Mr Palmer's United Australia Party in the Senate - although not in WA - was 'desperate' and an insult to West Australians. He described Mr Albanese as resilient, authentic and one of the most experienced political figures in the nation. 'He is a fundamentally decent person, driven by empathy and a deep sense of civic responsibility,' Mr McGowan said. 'I have every confidence he will make a fine prime minister.' Labor leader Anthony Albanese has unveiled new policies on health, housing and equality as he launched the party's campaign in Perth. HOUSING: * The Help to Buy scheme will provide an equity contribution of as much as 40 per cent of the purchase price of a new home and up to 30 per cent for an existing dwelling for 10,000 Australians. * The scheme enables savings of up to $380,000 for new homes and $285,000 for existing ones, with price caps of between $550,000 and $950,000 depending on the state and region. * Australians will be able to buy an additional stake in the home, owned by the federal government, in five per cent increments or pay the government back when they sell. * Homebuyers will avoid lenders mortgage insurance but still need a two per cent deposit and qualify for a standard loan. * Australians with a taxable income of up to $90,000 for individuals and up to $120,000 for couples can access the scheme. * The scheme will cost around $329 million over four years. * Labor will also establish a National Housing Supply and Affordability Council. MEDICINES: * Medication on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will be cut by $12.50, bringing the maximum price of listed medicines to $30. ELECTRIC VEHICLES * Labor will build more electric vehicle charging stations across Australia through a $39.3 million investment, matched by the NRMA. * Up to $80 million to deliver up to 16 hydrogen stations on Australia's busiest freight routes. * Many electric vehicles will be exempt from import tariffs and fringe benefits tax. * Labor will double the Driving the Nation Fund to $500 million, allowing the Commonwealth to co-invest in additional EV chargers, as well as hydrogen and biofuels refuelling infrastructure. MANUFACTURING: * Labor will use $1 billion as part of its $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund to develop value-added products from Australian resources. * Minerals like lithium and nickel used in batteries will be processed in Australia. * One in every 10 jobs on federally funded worksites will be filled by apprentices or trainees. EQUALITY: * Gender pay equity will become an objective of the Fair Work Act. * The Fair Work Commission's powers to order pay increases for workers in low paid, female-dominated industries will be increased.

The pedal pubs are open-air, foot powered trolley buses that allow people to enjoy drinks while riding through the city. The crash took place at around 6.30pm at the intersection of 14th and West Peachtree Streets, according to CBS 46. Authorities said that they believe the shuttle was attempting to turn when it toppled over. Two people were critically injured, three sustained what were termed 'serious injuries' and 10 people suffered minor injuries, according to Atlanta Fire and Rescue. Officials do not know how many people were on board the pedal pub at the time of the accidents.    Firefighters needed to use an ambulance bus, usually reserved for 'mass-casualty events' to take 10 of the injured to local hospitals.  'The Atlanta Fire Rescue Department has a mobile ambulance we call it MAV-1..we utilized that to transport 10 and Grady facilitated the transportation of the other 5 patients,' said Jason McLain, Battalion Chief.  The intersection had to be shut down as officials tended to those that were injured before transporting them to four different Atlanta hospitals.   No other vehicles were involved. The crash remains under investigation.",

Emergency services were called to the Patrick Avenue address, in Croydon North, about 10.15pm on Saturday to reports of an assault. 'Paramedics worked on a woman found with critical injuries,' a police spokesperson said. 'Sadly, the woman -- who is yet to be formally identified -- died at the scene.' Homicide squad detectives are investigating the death. A 40-year-old Croydon North man is assisting police with their enquiries. Neighbours told the Herald Sun they head a woman scream, with one saying they believed the commotion was animals having a fight.  Another local said the man in custody was a 'nice normal person' and 'they were a quiet family'.  Police have taped off the scene as forensic teams carried items away from the scene.  Children's toys, including stuffed animal and balls, could be seen in the garage, with police taking a box of the items away.  Daniel Mr Woodrow who lives nearby said he was shocked to stumble across the police presence during his morning walk.  'I got woken up last night, I got out of bed -- I actually thought it might've been a cat trying to kill a possum, there was a human element to it,' he said. Anyone with further information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or through the website.",

But with hypertension often leading to potentially fatal stroke, the nation is being urged to undertake more regular checks. As high blood pressure has no immediate symptoms it often goes undiagnosed, the Stroke Foundation warns. But over time, it can put extra stress on vessel walls, causing them to narrow or break down, which can eventually lead to a stroke. Regularly checking blood pressure might just be lifesaving because hypertension is the greatest modifiable risk factor, says the foundation's Sharon McGowan. 'When 80 per cent of all strokes are preventable, why would you not want to know your risk?' she asks. The Stoke Foundation is urging all Australians to visit their local pharmacy next month as part of their Biggest Blood Pressure Check campaign, which coincides with World Hypertension Day on May 17. A quick and painless check can be all it takes to mitigate the risk, as Ms McGowan herself experienced. 'In my first year as CEO of Stroke Foundation, by participating in Australia's biggest blood pressure check campaign, I discovered that I had high blood pressure,' she said. 'Thanks to our very own awareness campaign, my blood pressure is now controlled but it could have been a very different outcome.' A normal blood pressure measurement is described as around 120 over 80mmHg. A measurement of 140 over 90mmHg is regarded as high and puts its owner at increased risk of stroke, no matter what their age. Stroke is Australia's third most common cause of death, with 55,000 people likely to suffer one each year. While the risk between the ages of 45 and 85 is one in four for men and one in five for women, the latter experience worse post-stroke disability and are more than three times as likely to be institutionalised. The disparity may be due to a difference in symptoms experienced between the sexes which can lead to misdiagnoses, researchers from Sydney's George Institute for Global Health have said.",
  "27c56c943db3f0db4ef05c23da68b1f9a20d8ced7df6cf3ab0d058f8": "A prison governor who had 'intimate liaison' with an inmate and sent him messages calling him 'babe' has been jailed for eight months. Married Victoria Laithwaite, 47, was caught sending prisoner James Chalmers, 30, messages which suggested a relationship between the pair while he was banged up. She was working as head of safer custody and equalities when the texts were discovered on a mobile phone found inside the prisoner's cell at HMP Onley. A court heard in one exchange she said 'I thought you'd ditched me' while in another she wrote: 'I was thinking all sorts babe'. A photograph of Laithwaite was also found saved on the phone discovered inside Chalmers' cell. The sentencing judge told Laithwaite that her offence was aggravated by her 'serious breach of trust'  in her role as a prison governor - which included responsibility for ensuring the support of the most vulnerable inmates. Her defence lawyer said she was aware she has 'destroyed her life' and put her family 'through hell' because of her 'foolishness'. Laithwaite, whose husband also works at the category C jail in Northamptonshire, was arrested following the discovery of the phone on April 7 last year. She went on to plead guilty to an offence under Section 44 of the Serious Crime Act 2007 of engaging in communications with an illicit mobile. Today Laithwaite, of Coventry, was jailed for eight months at Northampton Crown Court while Chalmers was caged for 24 months. Sentencing, Her Honour Judge Adrienne Lucking said: 'You had been employed at HMP Onley with particular responsibility for vulnerable prisoners. 'You've been in HMP service for over 20 years and had in 2017 passed your exams to attain your grade of governor. 'The training and requirements for the standard of conduct for governors would have been very clear in your mind. 'Your offence is aggravated by your serious breach of trust, such conduct undermines the safety and good order of Her Majesty's prisons. 'Your culpability was high. Because of the position you are in the only punishment in this case is imprisonment. 'James Chalmers, at the time of these offences you were serving a sentence of two years nine months imprisonment. 'On the 7th April 2021, two mobile phones, one memory stick and four sim cards were recovered from James Chalmers' phone. 'One phone had sent and received messages to Victoria Laithwaite's phone. On the 4th and 5th of April an image of Mrs Laithwaite was sent and saved. 'It was a highly inappropriate relationship that was clear from the messages recovered.' Prosecutor Sinjin Bulbring earlier told the court the pair were caught after intelligence was received they had been messaging each other at the prison. He added: 'The nature of the messages is suggestive of a relationship between the two. 'For example, in response to a message from Chalmers, Laithwaite wrote: 'Yeah but I was worried when I didn't hear from you. Thought you'd ditched me. If that's the case, please just say it, I'd rather know.' 'With a response she then wrote: 'I haven't heard from you in two days, I was thinking all sorts babe.' with a kiss at the end. 'Later on the same day, she wrote: 'Your mum has been worried, too, can you message her. Can you message me on the other phone, I need to talk to you x.' 'There was also a saved image which was an image of Laithwaite. In interview she answered no comment to all questions in regards to a relationship with Chalmers. 'In interview, Chalmers denied the items found in his room were his. He admitted that he had used the phones to call his family and denied ever contacting Laithwaite.' Sarah Mahmud, defending Laithwaite, said: 'She appears before you deeply ashamed, utterly embarrassed and completely regretful. 'She is under no illusions of the severity of the offence. Committing this offence, she has single-handily destroyed her life, the life of her husband and her children. 'There is no question about it, she has put her family through hell. 'Both Mrs Laithwaite and her family have been put through utter turmoil because of her foolishness. 'She was relied upon very heavily by a number of very complex prisoners, including Mr Chalmers. She developed a rapport with Mr Chalmers, initially to help him. 'There were messages sent between the two parties but ultimately only two phone calls. 'Those two phone calls were attempted phone calls without duration. The messages were only over a finite amount of time. 'Mrs Laithwaite has said that there is no excuse. 'This was a mere blip in an otherwise unblemished career. There was not a physical relationship. 'There had been a breakdown in their marriage, to a point where they thought they could not return from. 'It is also worth noting that Mr Laithwaite has worked at HMP Onley. 'He has had to go into work every day knowing that people are talking about this. 'This is a lady that has lived her life faultlessly where she has sought to help others but she has fallen down the wrong path.' The court heard Chalmers has 19 court appearances for 44 offences including a variety of thefts, possession of drugs, driving offences and criminal damage. He pleaded guilty to transmitting and receiving images through electronic communications inside HMP Onley. Sarah Allen, defending, Chalmers, said: 'It is accepted that there was a degree of intimacy between them. This liaison started. 'He had served half of the sentence when the incident happened. He was released and then arrested. 'It's a matter of deep personal regret to him, a matter that he now wishes had never happened. 'This was a very short-lived matter that has come to an end.' Detective Inspector Dan Evans, of East Midlands Special Operations Unit, said Laithwaite had abused the position of trust and responsibility with the prison. He said: 'Laithwaite was a senior figure within the Prison Service, a public servant expected to behave to the highest standards. 'But this was serious misconduct on her part and only serves to erode confidence in the service as well as potentially undermine the complete security and good order needed to run a prison. 'Prisons are for rehabilitation, yet she willingly encouraged a prisoner to commit an offence, something which flies in the face of that. 'Illicit communications have the potential to seriously undermine order in a prison. 'This was a complex investigation, but working in partnership with colleagues in the Prison Service, I'm pleased we have rooted out a corrupt senior prison officer.'",
  "2f22a73bca8981483f8301f102ab87d1574ed919f877d50c02c62df4": "The town where The Only Way is Essex is filmed is at the centre of a trans rights row - after a PS7million children's play area was fitted with gender-neutral toilets. New facilities in King George's Playing Fields in Brentwood were opened by the Mayor, Councillor Olivia Sanders, in March to much fanfare. But joy over a new pavillion building, complete with soft play and sensory room is rapidly turned to disgust over the council's choice of lavatories. A few steps away from a children's ball pit are eight gender-neutral toilets that are the centre of parental storm. The PS1.99 stainless steel badges show merged symbols for a man and woman, with the design appearing to show them holding hands. One mother told MailOnline: 'Anyone can use these toilets really because they are public conveniences, but people have gone mad about it. 'One father told me it ran the risk of being a perverts' paradise because they were gender neutral. 'I am not sure exactly why they have to be unisex - why couldn't they have done half of them for men and half of them for women, with maybe two gender-neutral? 'How many gender-neutral children does the council think are going to be using the soft play ball pit?'  Another posted online: 'I don't like the idea of mixed toilets. 'Lots of kids go to the parks there with their friends, no parents with them, where's the safety in that? 'Too many perverts hanging around parks and toilets.'  One woman - who said she was a safeguarding officer - was also against the gender-neutral facilities. She declared: 'I have a problem with the mixed toilets. 'They are not in the best interests of children.' The guidance says that toilets can be legally limited to men and women with separate gender-neutral facilities as long as trans people are taken into account. This is explained through two examples.  One is a small cafe with limited space and facilities for public use which has separate lockable, self-contained male and female toilets with hand basins in single units.  The EHRC says that to ensure they are fully inclusive, and to make the most effective use of the available facilities, the cafe could decide to make them all gender neutral. A second example is a community centre which has separate male and female toilets. The centre could conduct a survey in which some service users say that they would not use the centre if the toilets were open to members of the opposite biological sex, for reasons of privacy and dignity or because of their religious belief.  It decides to introduce an additional gender-neutral toilet, and puts up signs telling all users that they may use either the toilet for their biological sex or to use the gender neutral toilet. It is not clear what consultation with the public was done over the unisex loos.  Last week female students at the University of Plymouth have been told not to confront anyone they suspect of posing as a woman in their toilets - and instead 'protect them from harm'. Signs in both male and female lavatories around its buildings contain the warning posters branded with the pink, blue and white strips of the trans flag. Critics have branded the move 'repellent gaslighting' and questioned why a third toilet space could not be created instead It comes amid fierce debate over the issue of trans women in female spaces, such as hospital wards, and whether they should be allowed to compete in women's sports. There are also fears predatory sex offenders could pose as trans women to gain access to female loos. It also comes weeks after the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said service providers wishing to limit services to a single sex are legally able to do so, provided the reasons are justified and proportionate. The ruling means it is legal for a gym to limit communal changing rooms to a single sex, as long as a gender neutral changing room is also provided for trans people.  Brentwood Borough Council claimed it had made the toilets gender-neutral to make it easier for parents to accompany their children to the loo.      A spokesperson told MailOnline: 'The new toilet facilities in the Pavilion at King George's Playing Fields are self-contained individual toilet cubicles. 'This makes it easier for parents to accompany their children of the opposite sex to the bathroom and also reduces waiting times as you only need to wait until a cubicle is free.'",
  "35928d213eb92cf981038290aa6482d15129f5cadf3f11f472f72b55": "No migrants have arrived in small boats across the English Channel for nearly ten days in what is being claimed as an early victory for the Government's new scheme for sending asylum seekers to Rwanda. The last migrants to arrive at Dover in Kent were a total of 263 across seven small boats on April 19 - and Ministry of Justice data has revealed not a single adult or child has made it across since, up to and including yesterday. It also comes amid a new strategy to deal with Channel migrants launched on April 14 which saw the military take charge of attempts to control crossings with a joint task force drawn from the Navy, Army and Air Force in Kent. Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen said today that the drop to zero was evidence that Home Secretary Priti Patel's scheme, which will see asylum seekers sent 4,000 miles to claim refugee status from Rwanda, is 'working already'. The controversial agreement with the East African nation, which will see it receive asylum seekers deemed by the UK to have arrived 'illegally' and therefore inadmissible under new immigration rules, was signed on April 14. Mr Bridgen, the MP for North West Leicestershire, tweeted: 'Priti's migrant policy is working already. No illegal migrant crossing for a week and no income for people traffickers, freeing up civil servants to work on Ukrainian evacuees. We should offer the illegal migrants already here the option of returning to France or going to Rwanda.' But former Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage told GB News: 'There are some saying Rwanda is working, it's a success because virtually no migrants have come now for the last six or seven days. Believe you me, I know this subject. 'That is nothing to do with the prospect of being shipped off to Rwanda. It's because there has been a persistent, strong, north-easterly wind in the English Channel. When it gets calm again, the boats will continue to come.' Up to 300 military servicemen, Navy ships and surveillance drones are being deployed to the Channel after the Armed Forces took control with the Navy assuming Border Force's responsibility for intercepting migrant boats. An RAF Wildcat helicopter is now the key military asset in the air and is being used to carry out a final 'sweep' of the Channel at the end of each day to ensure all migrants - and their dinghies - have been recovered. Home Secretary Priti Patel is facing High Court challenges over controversial plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda. The charity Freedom From Torture, which supports survivors of torture who are often asylum seekers and refugees, wrote to the Home Office yesterday requesting further information, with a view to bringing a High Court claim over the policy. The first step towards another challenge, from charities Detention Action and Care4Calais - and the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union which represents the majority of Border Force staff, was taken on Tuesday when they sent a pre-action letter to the Home Office. A letter from Freedom From Torture's legal representatives, Leigh Day, says that, while a memorandum of understanding between the UK and Rwanda has been published, information about the policy has not been made publicly available. It also says the charity has 'serious concerns' about the policy and in due course plans to bring a judicial review. The charity is asking for any document which sets out the policy of relocating asylum seekers to Rwanda, any guidance or rules provided to Home Office staff or other UK officials, any documents relating to co-operation with Rwanda, and any equality impact or risk assessments carried out in relation to the policy. The letter requests that any response is sent by 4pm on May 4, and the charity plans to crowdfund to cover legal costs of the case. Meanwhile, representatives for Detention Action, Care4Calais and the PCS have sent a letter which challenges 'the Home Secretary's failure to disclose the criteria dictating which people seeking asylum will be transferred by force to East Africa and which will remain in the UK', according to a joint press release. Those groups are also crowdfunding to cover the costs of the possible legal action and are represented by Duncan Lewis Solicitors. Freedom From Torture, the PCS and Care4Calais were involved in a challenge due to be heard next week against the Home Secretary over plans to 'push back' migrants in boats crossing the Channel, but the planned policy was withdrawn on Sunday.  The helicopter is being aided by RAF drones operated out of Lydd Airport in Kent. Soldiers and airmen are also now being based at Dover to help UK Border Force staff with initial processing, and the military are able to issue directions to civilian staff of the UK Border Force, whose ships are remaining part of the Channel taskforce. Seven ships including HMS Tyne, plus smaller boats and a helicopter are being made available to patrol the sea and coastline, so Border Force staff can be freed up for processing migrants once they arrive on land. More than 6,500 migrants are thought to have arrived in the UK this year so far after crossing the Channel. In 2021 some 28,526 migrants reached UK shores aboard dinghies and small boats - up from 8,417 in 2020. The total number of migrants arriving so far this month has been 2,143 across 58 small boats, although the final day of arrivals to the present date was on April 19 when 263 were intercepted across seven small boats.   In March this year, 3,066 people made the crossing. That was nearly four times the amount recorded for the same month in 2021 (831) and more than 16 times the amount for 2020 (187). It was also the fourth highest monthly total recorded since the start of 2020, behind July (3,510), September (4,652) and November (6,869) last year. The figures for April 2022 mean the total number of migrants to arrive so far this year is 6,693 across 204 boats. Some 1,425 of these had made it across since the Royal Navy took over control of migrant operations in the Channel on April 14. Earlier this month,  the UK's former Border Force chief Tony Smith told the Daily Mail that more than 100,000 Channel migrants will reach Britain this year. Backing the Government's asylum deal with Rwanda, Mr Smith said: 'There comes a point where we need to get a grip of our border and stop the boats. 'The numbers are going up, a fourfold increase already this year - 28,500 last year,' he added. 'That's going to be over 100,000 this year just by migrant boats alone.' Mr Smith's prediction would be nearly 12 times the level seen in 2020, 54 times that of 2019 and more than 300 times that in 2018. In January, it emerged that the Home Office had produced official papers warning that 65,000 migrants could cross this year.  Meanwhile the Archbishop of Canterbury again waded into the row over the Government's Rwanda plan yesterday. The Most Rev Justin Welby said there were serious 'ethical questions' about using 'deterrence' to stop asylum seekers reaching the UK. 'The Church of England is not a passive observer of migration policy,' he wrote in the Daily Telegraph. 'Some of my fellow bishops, clergy and worshippers came to the UK escaping persecution or conflict. 'We welcome and serve asylum seekers at every level of society - from providing housing, food banks, social support and friendship, to scrutinising legislation in the Lords.

The new immigration policy will see asylum seekers who cross the Channel sent for processing in Rwanda, where they will have the right to apply to live. The Archbishop previously said the policy would not stand up to the scrutiny of God, prompting Boris Johnson to accuse him of being 'less vociferous' in his condemnation of Putin than he was in his attack on the policy.

Home Secretary Priti Patel has said the deal is about trying to 'empower' asylum seekers. 'It's always been a partnership based on resettlement, rebuilding lives,' she added.  In a speech earlier this month outlining the Rwanda agreement, Ms Patel said: 'The British people are fair and generous when it comes to helping those in need, but the persistent circumventing of our laws and immigration rules and the reality of a system that is open to gaming and criminal exploitation has eroded public support for Britain's asylum system and those that genuinely need access to it. 'Putting evil people smugglers out of business is a moral imperative. It requires us to use every tool at our disposal - and also to find new solutions. That is why today's migration and economic development partnership with Rwanda is such a major milestone. 'This agreement fully complies with all international and national law, and as part of this ground-breaking agreement, the UK is making a substantial investment in the economic development of Rwanda.' And a Home Office spokesman told MailOnline today: 'This world-leading Migration and Economic Development Partnership will overhaul our broken asylum system, which is currently costing the UK taxpayer PS1.5billion a year - the highest amount in two decades. 'It means those arriving dangerously, illegally or unnecessarily can be relocated to have their asylum claims considered and, if recognised as refugees, build their lives there. 'There is nothing in the UN Refugee Convention which prevents removal to a safe country. Under this agreement, Rwanda will process claims in accordance with national and international human rights laws.'",

Richard Eden, diary editor at the Daily Mail, says that they should just 'stay away'. 'I really get the impression that Harry and Meghan are loving all the speculation about whether they'll come for the Jubilee or not. What should be the wonderful celebrations of the Queen's amazing long reign, instead it's sort of become this saga or will-they-won't-they-come? Who cares? Just stay away, honestly,' he tells our royal talk show Palace Confidential. 'They want us to indulge in this speculation as long as possible.' Rebecca English, the Mail's royal editor, believes that Harry's row with the so-called men in grey suits is more dangerous than it might first appear. 'Prince Harry has built up such a wall of resentment and hatred against these people, I suspect it will always be a stumbling block when it comes to repairing his relationships with family members,' she says. 'Because he has such a great distrust and dislike for the people around them.' Once again these rows hurt the Queen on what should be a year of celebration for Her Majesty, argues the Daily Mail's Editor at Large, Richard Kay. 'I think it's tragic for her. The last thing she wants are these ongoing, bitter rows with her own grandchildren and the family,' he tells the programme. 'They had so much trouble in the 1990s which they had hoped they had put behind them, but this is somehow even worse and it must be enormously difficult for her and quite despairing.'

  "ddd19f973917a508b561779b1188bbf5b359557e95a3ab7d0cc464be": "Lingerie tycoon Michelle Mone's home has been raided by police investigating a firm for PS203 million of Covid PPE government contracts, it has been claimed. Tory peer Lady Mone, 50, is believed to have been present at an address that was searched by officers from the National Crime Agency, who raided homes and offices in London and the Isle of Man.  Lady Mone has a PS25million estate on the Isle of Man, as well as a home in Belgravia. It is unclear which address police visited.  They are said to have been searching for documents that could assist an inquiry into suspected fraud offences. No arrests are believed to have been made.  Lady Mone, from Glasgow, has denied any involvement with a company called PPE Medpro, which was given government contracts along with another firm.  However, it was revealed that she referred PPE Medpro to the officer of fellow Tory peer Theodore Agnew, who at the time was a Cabinet Officer minister responsible for the procurement of PPE. The NCA is currently investigating the award of contracts for supplying surgical gowns and masks to the NHS.  PPE Medpro appeared on the 'VIP Lane' list of companies given greater chances of a PPE contract. It was added to the list by Lord Agnew's office.  The firm, which is based in the Isle of Man, was formed in May 2020.  A few weeks later, it was given a contract to supply 25 million sterile gowns and masks. Lady Mone was linked to the company by the Guardian, however, she made clear she has no role in the company.  In January it emerged she had been referred to the House of Lords Commissioners for Standards. Labour peer George Foulkes said Lady Mone had failed to fully disclose her business interests in PPE Medpro and asked the commissioners to investigate whether she had breached the rules against lobbying when she referred the firm to the Government. Lady Mone has repeatedly denied any association with the company, which she recommended to the Cabinet Office as a potential supplier in May 2020. Although she has no actual formal connections with the company, her denials have come under scrutiny thanks to publicly documented connections between Anthony Page, PPE Medpro's owner, and businesses run by Lady Mone and her husband, Isle of Man-based billionaire Doug Barrowman. Lingerie tycoon Michelle Mone was born in 1971 and grew up in Glasgow's East End, leaving school with no qualifications aged 15 before finding work as a model. After running a sales and marketing team for the Labatt's brewing firm, she decided to create a range of support bras after the idea came to her while wearing an uncomfortable bra during a dinner party. Lady Mone founded MJM International with her then-husband Michael Mone in November 1996, and three years of research, design, and development resulted in the patented Ultimo bra. In August 1999, a month after having her third child, she launched Ultimo at the Selfridges department store in London, which sold the pre-launch estimate of six weeks of stock within 24 hours. The business grew rapidly and in 2010 she earned an OBE from the Queen for her contribution to business. But she sold 80 per cent of Ultimo in 2014, one year after announcing she had left the company following a breakdown in her marriage. Lady Mone was nicknamed 'Baroness Bra' after being elevated to the House of Lords in 2015, where her official title is Baroness Mone of Mayfair. To celebrate her 50th birthday, she decided to host five parties - one for each decade of her life - with her new husband billionaire tech tycoon Doug Barrowman, 55.    Lady Mone is being investigated under several sections of the Lords' code of conduct, including a section saying peers 'must never accept or agree to accept any financial inducement as an incentive or reward for exercising parliamentary influence'.  She is also being investigated under as section of the code saying peers 'must not seek by parliamentary means to confer exclusive benefit on an outside body or person (a) in which he or she has a financial interest (including by way of salary, fees, shareholding or other arrangement) or (b) in return for payment or reward'.  Lord Foulkes said Lady Mone had failed to fully disclose her business interests in PPE Medpro and asked the commissioners to investigate whether she had breached the rules against lobbying when she referred the firm to the Government. Mr Page, the sole owner of PPE Medpro, is a wealth management expert who works for Barrowman's Knox House Trust, part of the Knox Group of companies based on the Isle of Man, where Lady Mone and her husband live on a PS25 million estate. In December The Mail on Sunday revealed Mr Page is the director of a firm that owns a luxury yacht, called Lady M, on which Lady Mone sailed around the Adriatic last summer. Mr Page is also the majority shareholder of Lady Mone's new business venture Neo Space, which operates spaces for rent in Aberdeen.  Lady Mone founded lingerie brand Ultimo through parent company MJM International in 1996. She was made a life peer by David Cameron in 2015. Millions of the medical gowns bought by the NHS from PPE Medpro were never even used. At the time they had to reach the British Standard for the sterilisation of medical devices or what was called a 'technical equivalent'. If the equivalent was the standard aimed for, health regulator the MHRA had to approve them. It publishes lists of current products that had been given its authorisation to be used.  Earlier this month, Voirrey Coole, 40, who had been a director with PPE Medpro since it was formed on May 12, 2020, suddenly quit the company.  The company filings announced her appointment had been terminated, but her own listing declared her as having resigned. ",
  "7de2a17ddbced7184e77aafbe11036a6f2d4900727711fff7e3638f5": "Arthritis patients will be told by the NHS to lose weight and exercise as the main therapies for their condition under new clinical guidelines. Physical activity is a better option for relieving pain caused by osteoarthritis than painkillers such as paracetamol, the health watchdog says. Moving millions of patients with the condition onto an exercise regime could save billions of pounds of NHS cash by slashing the number of prescriptions for stronger painkillers, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) notes. Starting exercise programmes may briefly make the pain worse but this should settle down. More than 10million people in the UK have arthritis. Osteoarthritis, which causes joints to become stiff and sore, is the most common form of the condition, affecting 8.5m. Arthritis costs the NHS PS10bn a year, with 80 per cent of patients prescribed painkillers.  The guidelines give recommendations on use of medicines, such as offering non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) but not paracetamol or strong opioids.  Dr Paul Chrisp, of Nice, said: 'This is because new evidence has shown there was little or no benefit to people's quality of life, pain or psychological distress and particularly in the case of strong opioids, there was evidence that they can cause harm in the longer term, including possible addiction.' In the guidance, doctors are told to diagnose osteoarthritis themselves without further investigation in people aged 45 or over who have activity-related joint pain. Patients should also have no morning joint-related stiffness, or morning stiffness that lasts no longer than 30 minutes, to be diagnosed this way. The draft guideline says people can be offered tailored exercise programmes, with an explanation that 'doing regular and consistent exercise, even though this may initially cause discomfort, will be beneficial for their joints'. Exercising in the long-term also increases its benefits, the guideline adds. When it comes to weight loss, people will be told that 'any amount of weight loss is likely to be beneficial, but losing 10 per cent of their body weight is likely to be better than 5 per cent'. People can also be referred for hip or knee replacement if their condition cannot be managed in other ways, and referrals should not be held off due to age, sex or obesity. Dr Chrisp added: 'Osteoarthritis can cause people discomfort and prevent them from undertaking some of their normal daily activities. 'However, there is evidence which shows muscle strengthening and aerobic exercise can have an impact on not just managing the condition, but also providing people with an improved quality of life. 'Beginning that journey can be uncomfortable for some people at first, and they should be supported and provided with enough information to help them to manage their condition over a long period of time. 'Whilst topical and sometimes oral NSAIDs remain an important treatment option for osteoarthritis, we have taken the decision to not recommend some painkillers, such as paracetamol and some opioids for osteoarthritis.' Tracey Loftis, head of policy and public affairs at the charity Versus Arthritis, said: 'We've seen first-hand the benefits that people with osteoarthritis can get in being able to access appropriate physical activity, especially when in a group-setting. 'Something like exercise can improve a person's mobility, help manage their pain and reduce feelings of isolation. 'But our own research into the support given to people with osteoarthritis showed that far too many do not have their conditions regularly reviewed by healthcare professionals, and even fewer had the opportunity to access physical activity support. 'The lack of alternatives means that, in many cases, people are stuck on painkillers that are not helping them to live a life free from pain. 'While we welcome the draft Nice guidelines, healthcare professionals need further resources and support to better understand their role in promoting treatment like physical activity for people with osteoarthritis. 'There is clearly a need for people with arthritis to be given a bigger voice so that their health needs are not ignored.' Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects around 400,000 people in the UK and nearly 1.3 million adults in the US. Women are up to three times more likely to develop the condition than men. Those with family history of rheumatoid arthritis are also more vulnerable. It is a long-term illness in which the immune system causes the body to attack itself, causing painful, swollen and stiff joints.   RA, the second most common form of arthritis that often begins between the ages of 40 and 50, tends to strike the hands, wrists and knees. Scientists are currently unsure as to the exact cause of RA, but smoking, eating lots of red meat and coffee drinkers are at higher risk.  A cure has yet to be found, but treatments are available and proven to help slow down the progressive condition.  RA is a complex autoimmune condition that is diagnosed and treated by a Consultant Rheumatologist in secondary care and the patient is followed up on a regular basis by a consultant-led multi-disciplinary team in hospital.

Cases have hit a record level and the specialists believe an ageing population and improvements to how cancers are reported are behind the rise.  Increasing exposure to the sun and more foreign holidays may also be to blame. There were 224,092 skin cancers recorded in England in 2019, a rise of 26 per cent on the 177,677 recorded in 2013, according to figures analysed by NHS Digital and the British Association of Dermatologists.  Between 2013 and 2019 the total was more than 1.4million. Dr Tanya Bleiker, the association's president, said: 'We are fast approaching a quarter of a million cases a year in England. We estimate that one in five people will have a skin cancer in their lifetime.  'While more needs to be done to prevent skin cancer, we also need to increase the resources available to tackle the rise.'  A breakdown shows there were 15,332 melanomas in 2019, up from 12,885 in 2013. Melanoma is less common than other skin cancers but can be more deadly.  There were also 47,977 cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas in 2019, up from 34,672 in 2013. When caught early this skin cancer is mostly curable.  There were 158,934 basal cell carcinomas in 2019, up from 128,406 in 2013. This form of the disease does not usually spread.  There were also 1,849 rare skin cancers in 2019, up from 1,714 in 2013.

  "e0a46232dfdc50df5ae51a10ce281d2b11bb41a9cba185349e52e8da": "James Corden will step down as the host of The Late Late Show at the end of next season amid plans to spend more time back home in the UK, DailyMail.com can confirm. The Brit, 43, made the decision to quit at the end of season eight despite the best efforts of CBS executives who exclusively told DailyMail.com that they 'desperately tried to keep him for longer.' The star and his wife of 10 years Jules are mulling over a return to the UK with their three children Max, 11, Carey, seven, and Charlotte, four, but they are still trying to 'figure out' what's next for the family.  An insider tells DailyMail.com that spending more time in the UK when the show ends is 'definitely on the horizon'.  Another source suggested he is planning on moving close to West Ham United's London Stadium in east London.  An insider told the Sun: 'James and Jules have had barely any time to see their families in the UK over the past few years due to his work schedule. They will go backwards and forwards for a while. 'Long-term, they both want to see more of their parents and are considering a permanent move back in a couple of years. 'They sold their house in London so would have to look for a new base in the capital.' The Late Late Show, which films out of Los Angeles, first premiered in 1995 with host Tom Snyder. Craig Kilborn and Craig Ferguson followed as host until James Corden came along in 2015.  Corden promised to 'go out with a bang' as he informed audiences of his decision to step down as the host of The Late Late Show. Revealing the news during the latest episode of the US talk show he said the show had 'changed my life' and promised there would be 'lots of tears' when his tenure came to an end. 'Seven and half years ago I started hosting this show and there's no other way to put it, it has changed my life,' he said. 'I never saw as it as my final destination, and I never want this show to overstay its welcome, I love making it and I really think in a year from now that will be a good time to move on and see what's out there.' He added: 'We are all determined to make this the best year we have ever had...we are going to go out with a bang. 'The fact that you watch this...all over the world...is an absolute privilege for me and every single person who makes this show.' 'We [CBS] desperately tried to keep him for longer but James only wanted to do one final year that will keep him on the show until next year,' a senior CBS source revealed. 'He's been such a hit for us for so many years, we will miss him very much.' 'It's very rare to find a talent who can redefine a long running format. His skits went viral globally, smashing records and creating the most watched online clips in the history of late night TV,' they continued.  'The biggest stars in the world have appeared on his show - which even took him to the White House!' Corden told Deadline it's been a difficult decision after enjoying such huge success.  'It's been it's a really hard decision to leave because I'm so immensely proud of the show. I'm thrilled to be extending [for a year]. I always thought I'd do it for five years and then leave and then I stayed on. I've really been thinking about it for a long time, thinking whether there might be one more adventure.' When asked if he plans to move home, Corden said he and his wife 'genuinely don't know the answer to that'. 'It's something we think about and we talk about a lot but we haven't really made a decision on that yet. That's the life side of things which we'll figure out,' he added.  'I love living here [in LA]. I love everything it's given. My family and I have never taken this incredible adventure for granted. Every day I drive down Sunset to work and I just think I'm from High Wycombe.' James Corden has played host to many A-lister guests on the Late Late Show. Famous faces who've appeared on his show include:  The show has also won a slew of awards, picking up 11 gongs and being nominated for 33 more.  Its wins include:  Primetime Emmy 2016 - Outstanding Interactive Program  Critics Choice Award 2020 - Best talk show  Critics' Choice TV Award 2016 - Best talk show Telly Awards 2018 - Bronze Telly Comedy Use of Humor  Webby Awards 2021 - Social - Celebrity/Fan Social - Entertainment  Video - Comedy: Shortform Webby Awards 2020 - Video - Entertainment (Video Series & Channels)  YouTube Creator awards 2017 - Diamond Creator Award   He did admit he's eager to spend more time with his close pal Mark Noble, who is the captain of his favorite football team West Ham United. Noble is retiring at the end of this season. 'He's the happiest that I'm not leaving in September because he's desperate to get out and play some golf,' Corden said.  'I'll have been here for eight and a half years, he's been at that club since he was nine. Nothing makes me happier to be thought of in the same breath as Mark Noble but I would be undeserving of such praise.' An insider added to DailyMail: 'What's next? Well James is focused on producing a really spectacular current and final season of the show.' 'He'll also be launching Mammals in autumn (Fall), which he is excited about.' 'However more time in the UK after filming wraps is definitely on the horizon as he is very close with his family there.' Under Corden's tenure at The Late Late Show, he developed smash hit segments like Carpool Karaoke, where he drives a celebrity around and they sing together. Carpool Karaoke was later spun off into its own show for Apple in 2017 and even took home an Emmy Award. It currently in season five. 'He told us that he has had an amazing time and is incredibly grateful to CBS but feels now is right time to go out on a high and make his final year the biggest one yet,' a CBS source said. 'James and the show have won countless Emmys, he's won a Critics Choice as well as winning a Tony Award in 2012 before taking his post at CBS. He immediately won critics and fans over as well as the huge celebrities he managed to secure.' The father-of-three has previously referred to his team on the show as his family and even paid them out of his own pocket during the pandemic. James' time at the network has not been without controversy, however. In 2021, the show was forced to change one of Corden's more famous skits, Spill Your Guts, after it as accused of being anti-Asian. The segment, which has featured stars such as Justin Bieber, Kendall Jenner and Chrissy Teigen, sees participants presented with the choice of either answering a prying question or eating something dubbed 'gross'. Several of the unpalatable items hailed from Asian culture and Corden himself had called many of them 'disgusting.' Last summer, a TikTok user launched the Change.org petition which garnered nearly 50,000 signatures and James later announced on the Howard Stern Show that he would no longer use Asian foods in the segment. But Corden admits leaving the show will be a bittersweet farewell for him.  'I'll miss the adrenaline of thinking 'Next week I'm going to jump out of a plane with Tom Cruise or in two weeks' time, we're going to drive around the White House in a car with Michelle Obama or sing Penny Lane with Paul McCartney driving down Penny Lane,' he said. Beyond his own show, James hosted the Tony Awards and Grammy Awards, as well as fronting other prime time shows for CBS and the Friends reunion for HBO Max.  He also has a film career starring in movies like Peter Rabbit, Prom, Into the Woods, Trolls and Cats. He will appear in a new Prime Video drama, Mammals, later this year - his first British TV role since his Gavin And Stacey Christmas special broke records as the most watched non spring event in the UK of the last decade. From Hollyoaks to Hollywood: How lad from High Wycombe who started out in soap became friend of royalty and one half of Tinseltown power couple with some of showbiz's biggest players on speed-dial  James Corden is set to leave the Late Late Show to spend more time with his family in the UK, capping an extraordinary journey for a star who first found fame as an Essex lad before schmoozing his way into a Los Angeles lifestyle that rivals that of any global megastar. Corden and his interior designer wife Julia have a roll-call of Hollywood royalty on speed-dial after carefully cultivating connections with the industry's biggest movers and shakers. The Cordens' social status was cemented when they were invited to the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's wedding where James was asked to compere the private evening reception. There they were spotted chatting with the Clooneys who, it turns out, are among the clients' of Julia's interior design brand Charles & Co. Also there were David and Victoria Beckham, who also called upon the firm when it came to redecorating. Among the Cordens' close friends are Harry Styles and Dominic Cooper, while James has had everyone from Sir Elton John to Tom Hanks and Lady Gaga on his show. The couple also boast a home worthy of Hollywood superstars, living in a PS7.3 million mansion in Brentwood, an upmarket LA suburb, with their three children. The property hast five bedrooms, eight bathrooms and a pool, plus such typically Hollywood features as a wood-panelled library, cinema room and gym. However, it wasn't all glitz and glamour for Corden. The actor, 43, made his first stage appearance at the age of 18 in a one-line role. He then went on to interview Meat Loaf before enjoying a small role in an episode of Hollyoaks.  He first came to prominence from 2000 to 2005, when he starred in Fat Friends as Jamie Rymer. His work in the series earned him a nomination for the 2000 Royal Television Society Award for Network Newcomer On Screen.  Corden's Fat Friends co-star Ruth Jones would pay a pivotal role in his future, with the two combining for the popular BBC Three sitcom Gavin and Stacey. The duo co-wrote the smash-hit show and also starred as the titular characters' friends. His role as Essex lad Smithy catapulted Corden into British stardom. Suddenly, his face was everywhere and starred editions of Comic Relief, performed England's World Cup football song with Dizzie Rascal and was even given a guest role in an episode of Doctor Who.  The Gavin And Stacey star first cracked America when his stage show One Man Two Guvnors transferred to Broadway in 2012 after a successful stint in the West End.  He was then catapulted to worldwide fame after he made his debut as the presenter of The Late, Late Show in 2015, taking over the role from Craig Ferguson. With the immense popularity of segments like Carpool Karaoke, James has become one of America's most beloved late night presenters. And thanks to his success on The Late, Late Show, James has landed a number of roles in Hollywood films like Into The Woods and The Prom, and he has also hosted the Tony Awards.   He has since reportedly more than doubled his wealth to a whopping PS50m after moving to Hollywood.  Following his move to LA, James has become one of the partners at film production company Fulwell 73 and seen his assets swell.  He was previously estimated as being worth around PS22m, however in the latest accounts from his company the business' assets are declared as PS140m.   The star also has earnings from his film and TV roles, with him thought to earn $7m for The Late Late Show, as well as millions of dollars tied up in his properties.  From decorating the homes of celebrities to hosting them on a chatshow, Julia and James have settled into the centre of life in Los Angeles. Since relocating to the States, Corden has drawn other high-profile pals into his circle, including U2 frontman Bono and actor Sean Penn. Mary Poppins actress Emily Blunt and her American husband John Krasinski - one of Hollywood's most popular power couples - are regular guests at his home. When he was still a jobbing actor, known mainly for his role in the Alan Bennett play The History Boys, Corden shared a flat above a London doughnut shop with Dominic Cooper. Corden joked that there was no furniture and only one piece of cutlery, a spatula, and that the fridge contained only 'half a vitamin water and a Lindt chocolate bunny'. Today, he shares a PS7.3 million mansion in Brentwood, an upmarket LA suburb, with Julia and their three children. There are five bedrooms, eight bathrooms and a pool, plus such typically Hollywood features as a wood-panelled library, cinema room and gym. It also has its own spa and an office complete with high-tech film editing facilities. While he stays in LA, Corden rents out the family's PS3 million London home in leafy Belsize Park for about PS15,000 a month. His neighbours in Brentwood -just a 20-minute drive from the CBS studios where his chat show is filmed - include Gwyneth Paltrow, Cindy Crawford, Harrison Ford and Steven Spielberg. 'The children are happy and healthy and love their circle of friends,' says the source. 'James is a devoted dad and spends a lot of time with the kids. His weekends are sacrosanct. 'James knows none of this success would mean anything without Julia's love and support. His family means everything to him.' Out on the town, Corden favours the luxurious Tower Bar at the Sunset Tower Hotel in West Hollywood, where phone calls and photos are banned. Jennifer Aniston held her 50th birthday party there in February. Corden's tipple? Don Julio 1492 tequila at PS120 a bottle. 'The best parties are at his house,' says the source. 'He'll hire a team of private chefs and you never know who will be there, from the heads of TV networks to stars like Emily Blunt.' There is, too, an unlikely friendship with Anna Wintour, the formidable British editor of American Vogue. They met after Anna saw Corden in the Broadway version of the play One Man, Two Guvnors in 2011 and sent him a card telling him she was his biggest fan. 'Through her, he has met everyone,' says the source. James' Carpool Karaoke has seen the funny-man bantering with megastars like Madonna, Britney Spears and Adele. Meanwhile stars among their closest circle include One Direction star Harry Styles, with Corden recently lending him his Palm Springs home while the musician was shooting his part in Wilde's new movie. His relationship with Mamma Mia star Dominic Cooper dates back to 2004 when they were rooming together and starring in The History Boys, a British campus comedy. Speaking of their days sharing a flat in London on James' chat show, The Late Late Show, Dominic reminisced on how they would often sleep in the same bed due to the lack of furniture. He said: 'We were never there at the same time much, were we? But when we were, there was absolutely no furniture.We had a bed, one bed. We only had one piece of cutlery which was a spatula. 'I remember one depressing evening, he caught me, he came home and I was eating baked beans with the spatula.' James added: 'We rented it furnished. It had no furniture in it and we never thought to complain.' It was Dominic who introduced James to now wife Julia, who was an old school friend of his. He told People : 'I said, 'Hi, Jules. You might be the most beautiful woman in the world.' She said, 'Well, thank you very much. That sounds like something you say a lot.' 'And I said, 'I've never said it before in my life.' That was it. That was it, really. I was in. And by an absolute miracle, so was she.' Later, the two slinked off to a corner to plan the rest of their lives, with James revealing: 'I remember saying to her, 'Well, what about on Friday we could do nothing together? You could come over and we could just do nothing. 'And then maybe we could do nothing on Saturday, and we could do nothing on the Sunday. And if our evenings are enough of nothing, then maybe this would become something.' 'And she said, 'That sounds like a fun idea.' James proposed on holiday in the Maldives in 2008, while Julia was expecting their eldest son Max. They married in September 2012 at Babington House, with a spectacular guest list including Lara Stone, comedian Michael McIntyre, and Snow Patrol lead singer Gary Lightbody. The couple also have two daughters, Charlotte, six, and Carey, three. James and Prince Harry have been friends for years. He previously told People: 'The friendship mostly started with being out and about the same places in London.' The chat show host and his wife Julia attended the royal wedding to Meghan Markle in May 2018. At the time, he described the nuptials, revealing: 'It was so lovely. I've known Prince Harry about seven years now and it was wonderful. 'It was one of the most beautiful ceremonies I've ever been to. It was gorgeous, it was a whole affair, it was happy, it was joyous, it was uplifting.' James made a showstopping entrance to the palace afterparty as it was claimed he arrived at Prince Harry and Meghan 's wedding reception dressed up as King Henry VIII. At the time, People Magazine reported the presenter arrived last to the reception, clad in the monarch's signature Tudor costume, saying he 'didn't know what to wear'. When he was still a jobbing actor, known mainly for his role in the Alan Bennett play The History Boys, Corden shared a flat above a London doughnut shop with Dominic Cooper (now star of hit TV show Preacher). Corden joked that there was no furniture and only one piece of cutlery, a spatula, and that the fridge contained only 'half a vitamin water and a Lindt chocolate bunny'. Today, he shares a PS7.3 million mansion in Brentwood, an upmarket LA suburb, with Julia and their three children.

'He'll hire a team of private chefs and you never know who will be there, from the heads of TV networks to stars like Emily Blunt.' He said: 'Harry asked me to do some kind of performance...it was fun, it was a really special day.' Meanwhile the presenter also stole the march on Oprah by airing his antics with Prince Harry days before the prime-time interview that enraged Buckingham Palace. In a wide-ranging chat mostly carried out on an open-top bus, the Duke of Sussex - or 'Haz,' as Corden calls him - reveals he went from 'zero to sixty' with Meghan and how the pressures of living in London were 'destroying my mental health.' Meanwhile Julia is co-founded of the interior design company Charles & Co, which counts The Beckhams among its clients While James has a successful acting and presenting career, his wife Julia runs a hugely successful and popular interior design company. With a background in TV production, talent management and PR, she founded Charles & Co in 2016 with Vicky Charles, who was the design director for Soho House having worked for the group for 20 years. The pair were introduced by Soho House CEO Nick Jones and set up the business while Julia was taking time off to have her children. She handles the business side of Charles & Co, recently telling The Telegraph her role is 'to allow Vicky to be as creative as possible.' High-profile clients include the Beckhams, the Clooneys, Emma Stone, Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis. Builds for the pair usually include a 'social, club-like spaces' within their homes, including bars, wine cellars, playrooms and even libraries. Meanwhile others might value a recording studio, with Julia revealing: 'Being able to record a little voiceover without having to leave your house can make a huge difference, especially if you live outside the city.' Last year, James was unveiled as the new ambassador for WW, previously known as Weight Watchers, after becoming 'embarrassed' over his body. During a chat with Oprah Winfrey on WW's Facebook page he revealed he 'hates' doing exercise but his wife Julia plans circuits for them to do. James revealed in the New Year that he has signed up to the health and fitness programme to help shift the conversation around wellness. He said: 'I want to change the way that I live. I want to be better for my children and for my family. I don't want to wake up tired, or feel embarrassed when I'm chasing my son on the soccer field and out of breath after three minutes.' James has been candid about his weight struggles in the past and back in 2017 he shed six stone in weight and found major success in Hollywood, however he has also admitted the one food that he can't stop eating is bread. Speaking about the last time he was 'off bread' for dietary reasons, James recalled an incident while he was out at dinner saying: ''[I have] a sort of battle with food... 'Then they delivered this basket of warm, fresh bread and we're like, 'It's happening, we're doing it. Who are we trying to kid?' 'It's our nemesis, it's out to destroy us!'",
  "d1ace1ca4f86331707a27661fb0466ffcfdfd22d4c0e251bb6bd0c6b": "There have been calls for the MP who is accused of watching pornography in the House of Commons to quit and to be named and shamed. While Boris Johnson himself lashed out at unknown MP today, hinting he faces being kicked out of the Conservative Party. One of those calling for resignation is MP Nickie Aiken, who is also the vice chair of the 2022 Committee - a recently formed Tory group to push for gender equality. The male MP in question 'has to resign', she told Times Radio, saying the individual was causing 'pain, suffering & embarrassment' to the Conservative Party and to Parliament. Former minister Caroline Nokes has accused the chief whip of avoiding addressing the issue, and said the whip should have been suspended already. Chief whip Chris Heaton-Harris has chosen to not immediately discipline the MP. Instead, the allegations will be left to the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS) - a decision which has been criticised as the process can last for years and during which those accused remain anonymous. According to The Telegraph, the person facing the accusations is not a relatively new MP and was not in the intakes of Tories in the 2015, 2017 and 2019 elections. A spokeswoman for Mr Heaton-Harris said: 'Following allegations of inappropriate behaviour in the House of Commons the chief whip has asked that this matter be referred to the ICGS. 'Upon the conclusion of any ICGS investigation the chief whip will take appropriate action.' Speaking to reporters in Lancashire, Mr Johnson was asked whether the parliamentarian would lose the Conservative whip if the allegations are proven. 'I think it's obviously unacceptable for anybody to be doing that kind of thing in the workplace,' he said. 'It would be the same for any kind of job up and down the country, let's be absolutely clear about that. 'What needs to happen now is that the proper procedures need to be gone through, the independent complaints and grievances procedure needs to be activated and we need to get to understand the facts, but, yeah, that kind of behaviour is clearly totally unacceptable.' It came as the sleaze issue crossed the aisle, with a Labour frontbencher accused of telling one of his party's female MPs they were a 'secret weapon' because men wanted to sleep with them. The female politician - who wants to remain anonymous - was allegedly subjected to the lewd remark at an event in Westminster. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace also urged MPs to stay out of Parliament's 'poisonous' drinking dens amid growing uproar at sexism and sleaze at Westminster. Mr Wallace said the long hours and access to alcohol had been a problem for many years, and his advice to colleagues was 'finish your day's work and go home'. In the latest grim claims, a woman MP told BBC Wales that when someone praised her as a 'rising star' of her party at an event, the unnamed shadow cabinet minister intervened.  They apparently said she was a 'secret weapon' because 'women want to be her friend' and men wanted to sleep with her. 'She is a vote winner,' they reportedly added. Keir Starmer said: 'I'm deeply concerned to hear these suggestions and these allegations. 'There is a complaints procedure and I want everybody to have the confidence to use that complaints procedure because I would want to get to the bottom of this and do something about it.' A Labour spokeswoman said: 'The Labour Party takes all complaints extremely seriously.    'They are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures, and any appropriate action is taken.' It is understood that no complaint has been received, and BBC Wales said the woman did not want to be identified for fear of consequences.  Labour has recently introduced a new independent complaints procedure to boost confidence, and is encouraging people to come forward. In a round of interviews this morning, Mr Wallace said 'there's no place for pornography in any workplace' and said there needs to be a cultural change in Westminster. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I certainly think they should lose the whip.' He pointed to the handful of exclusive bars on the Parliamentary estate, where drinks are much cheaper than outside, with a pint of beer costing around PS3.60. Mr Wallace told Times Radio that there were 'fights', 'sexist comments' and 'propositions' in the bars.  'What I have witnessed is, what I think is the fundamental problem of Westminster, is the overall culture is that hundreds and hundreds of people (are) working long hours in a place with bars,' he said. 'And for some people, under lots of pressure for all sorts of reasons. And that... mix becomes poisonous.'  Mr Wallace said the problems had been 'going on for decades' and were 'not easy to fix'.  'I mean, my advice to any MP is actually avoid the bars, you know, finish a day's work and go home.  'But you know, that is part of the ultimate challenge around parliament that I think needs to be fixed.  'And you know, in the Armed Forces, I have a similar challenge, which is often in those high pressure environments where people mix and then alcohol is consumed, you end up in a place where people do things, either they regret, or things that is totally unacceptable.'  The Defence Secretary told Sky News: 'There is a range of allegations that go right across the House, go right across the parties. 'This is a problem, I think, about the overall culture of the House of Commons. 'It is late sitting, long nights with bars, and that very often leads, and it has done for decades, to behavioural challenges... 'I think it's really important that we think about ways to change the culture in the House of Commons.' Attorney General Suella Braverman told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour that if the allegation of an MP watching porn in Parliament is proven there should be a 'severe reprimand' including an opportunity to oust them from the Commons. 'I'm shocked and appalled... what would possess them? It is totally unacceptable,' she said. 'I am very glad that the chief whip has now referred it to the independent complaints and grievance process.' Ms Braverman went on: 'I think we would really need to see a situation where the whip would be removed. I am ashamed that this person is carrying the Conservative rosette. 'I think they really do need to be subject to a recall, and no longer holding their privileged position as a member of parliament.' Ms Braverman said while all the men she had worked with were 'respectful' there were MPs who behaved like 'animals'.  'There is however, a very small minority of men - and it is men - who fall short, and there are some bad apples who are out of order, who behave like animals and are bringing parliament into disrepute to be honest,' she said. 'I don't think we should be saying there is a pervasive culture. That is not my experience. There are certain individuals who are behaving in an unacceptable way.'   The Conservative Party's chief whip has ordered an official investigation into claims that an MP was watching porn on his mobile phone in the House of Commons Chamber. A spokesman said the matter would be referred to Parliament's independent complaints and grievance scheme (ICGS). 'Following allegations of inappropriate behaviour in the House of Commons the Chief Whip has asked that this matter be referred to the ICGS. 'Upon the conclusion of any ICGS investigation the Chief Whip will take appropriate action.'  Ms Nokes told PoliticsHome the referral amounted to 'kicking it into the long grass' and it would be 'months before anything is done'. 'It's not shouldering the burden of responsibility of dealing with it, and I think the Chiefs should have dealt with it immediately,' she said.  Sir Keir said the Conservative Party should 'take action now' against the MP. He said: 'I think it's very good that we've got an independent system and obviously that requires anonymity. 'This is an unusual case because the Tory Party knows who this individual is. 'I think that they should deal with it and deal with it sooner rather than later and take appropriate action. 'So, nothing wrong with the independent process, but I think the Tory Party, they know who this is, they should take action now.' Those reported to the body are given automatic anonymity, meaning the Tory MP's name will not be published while he is under investigation. Only witnesses are able to make complaints to the scheme. The body is said to be investigating at least 56 MPs - including three ministers and two shadow ministers - who have been accused of sexual misconduct. Two female MPs say they witnessed their colleague looking at adult images more than once.",
  "1c54c7fc7697f4b3f1073e082547ddabaa18da8ecc5f7f8408dace47": "Around 8,000 British Army troops and dozens of tanks will take part in exercises across eastern Europe to combat Russian aggression in one of the largest deployments since the Cold War. Tens of thousands of Nato troops will join the British forces that will be deployed to countries ranging from Finland to North Macedonia this summer under plans that have been enhanced since the invasion of Ukraine. The Joint Expeditionary Force alliance, which includes Finland and Sweden, will also be taking part. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said the purpose behind the exercises is to demonstrate how the British Army has modernised into a 'lethal, agile and global force'. The action had been long planned, but that it had been enhanced in response since Russia invaded its neighbour in late February. Only yesterday was the first UK casualty in Ukraine confirmed, Scott Sibley, a veteran of the British armed forces had served in the Commando Logistic Support Squadron in Afghanistan. Commander Field Army Lieutenant General Ralph Wooddisse emphasised the importance of the exercises, he said: 'The UK makes a significant contribution to the defence of Europe and the deterrence of Russian aggression. 'The British Army's series of exercises is fundamental to both. 'The scale of the deployment, coupled with the professionalism, training and agility of the British Army, will deter aggression at a scale not seen in Europe this century.' The UK deployment is expected to build to a peak of around 8,000 personnel operating in mainland Europe between April and June. Troops from B Squadron of the Queen's Royal Hussars have already deployed to Finland, which shares an 830 mile land border with Russia, to take part in Exercise Arrow. Exercise Hedgehog next month will involve the Royal Welsh battlegroup and the Royal Tank Regiment, with exercises planned on the Estonia/Latvia border alongside 18,000 Nato troops. Hedgehog, the biggest military exercise in Estonia, takes place every four years and will involve a range of units including light and airborne forces, helicopters, armoured forces, artillery and air defence. Exercises alongside American troops are also taking place in Poland.  Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: 'The security of Europe has never been more important. 'These exercises will see our troops join forces with allies and partners across Nato and the Joint Expeditionary Force in a show of solidarity and strength in one of the largest shared deployments since the Cold War.'",
  "0a2ce2ed836154aa0b395cbfbc0a4fc309b315cbd1682aa8aaf4e6e4": "Jacob Rees-Mogg has shared an image of an empty Cabinet Office which enraged him so much that he left notes for the civil servants who were working from home.  Mr Rees-Mogg's zealous attempts to end WFH raised eyebrows this week, after he left notes saying 'sorry you were out when I visited, I look forward to seeing you in the office very soon' on empty desks at Whitehall.  However, he has now revealed the notes were prompted by his shock after discovering the Cabinet Office - which supports the Prime Minister and Cabinet - was abandoned at 11am on a weekday.   Mr Rees-Mogg, who is minister for Brexit opportunities and government efficiency, also said that some desks and computers were unused with notices on the walls that date from before the pandemic.   The MP said: 'It looked as if the office hadn't been used in two years. Thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money is being spent, and either they need to be there or not. If not, we should put somebody in this property.' Discussing a message he left on a whiteboard while on a visit to the Eurotunnel in Folkestone, Kent, he added: 'I wrote on the whiteboard saying, ''Can we reallocate this space because you clearly don't need it?'' Mr Rees-Mogg's zealous attempts to end WFH, including leaving notes on empty desks, have faced criticism from some other ministers, with Nadine Dorries accusing him of a 'Dickensian' approach to the issue. The Cabinet is also said to have backed away from the idea of stripping London weighting from the salaries of people who are still not yet commuting back into the capital. Mr Rees-Mogg has written to the rest of Cabinet calling on them to issue a clear message to staff about a 'rapid return to the office'.  Downing Street said Boris Johnson supported Mr Rees-Mogg's efforts. 'What the minister is seeking to achieve is to do everything possible to get the civil service to return to the pre-pandemic level,' the Prime Minister's official spokesman said. 'That is what he is seeking to do. That is supported by the Cabinet Secretary and obviously the Prime Minister.' But the Guardian later reported that the country's most senior civil servant, Simon Case, had in fact privately warned Mr Johnson against forcing officials back to the office. The newspaper said at least four permanent secretaries were also understood to have voiced concerns about the Government's rhetoric on the matter Mr Rees-Mogg presented figures to Cabinet last week showing that some Government departments were using as little as 25 per cent of office capacity in early April - the figure for Ms Dorries' Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport was 43 per cent. Ms Dorries told him his letter to Government departments brought to mind 'images of burning tallow, rheumy eyes and Marley's ghost' - a reference to Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol.  Dave Penman, the secretary general of the Civil service's FDA union, said: 'Hybrid working can save taxpayers millions by reducing the government estate and the pandemic showed that effective public services can be delivered regardless of where staff are placed.' By Martin Beckford for the Daily Mail Tens of thousands of civil servants are being allowed to carry on working from home indefinitely. Despite being urged by ministers to get back to the office for the sake of the economy, mandarins have quietly instituted permanent 'hybrid working'. A Daily Mail investigation found that staff are required to spend as little as 40 per cent of their working week in the office. Public sector offices around the country are still virtually empty, with only a handful of employees clocking in - months after lockdown restrictions were axed. The Mail's audit found that on a typical Monday in the middle of March, many publicly-funded bodies had less than 10 per cent of their staff in work. Some had under 5 per cent - and one had none at all. At some Whitehall departments - where ministers have been told to get their staff back - fewer than half were at their office desks and at one it was less than a quarter. At least 20 government agencies and Whitehall departments now have policies that mean staff are expected to be at their desks for only two days a week. Some are even giving home-based officials PS18 a month toward heating bills and up to PS350 to buy desks and chairs.   It comes as Boris Johnson summoned Passport Office bosses to Downing Street to explain the renewal chaos which has seen 700,000 outstanding applications still to clear amid fears over a summer of cancelled holidays. The Prime Minister is said to be 'horrified' at the backlog - but the Home Office insisted today that the agency's PS160,000-a-year director-general working from home at her village property in Leicestershire, 100 miles away from its London headquarters, has 'precisely zero bearing on the current situation with passports'. Abi Tierney, 48, who was appointed as director-general in early 2020 when the pandemic began and lives with her two young sons, is battling to control the chaos as customer services teams continue to work from home. Home Office sources said Dr Tierney, who is responsible for leading 3,500 Passport Office staff, spends most of her time working at its centres around Britain - including in London, where the headquarters is located in Victoria. And Home Office Permanent Secretary Matthew Rycroft said claims that she is under pressure to return to HQ full-time 'totally ignores reality'. He praised her for being 'a hugely talented leader', adding: 'With sites spread across the UK, Abi works day-in, day-out with teams around the country delivering vital services for the British public.' However the Daily Telegraph claimed today that a resident of the Leicestershire village where Dr Tierney lives said she appeared to be based there, 107 miles from London. Conservative former minister David Jones told MailOnline today that the claim 'underlines the importance of civil servants getting back to the office environment', adding: 'It beggars belief that any senior official would be staying at home when her office is so clearly in crisis.' And Tory MP Henry Smith told MailOnline that there had been 'notable deterioration in services' among government agencies, such as the Passport Office, as officials were slow to return to their offices. But the Home Office defended Dr Tierney and told MailOnline that it has Passport Offices 'in a range of locations across the UK, with 90 per cent of our staff based outside London', adding: 'It is therefore ludicrous to suggest that any senior leader not living there would impact on their ability to do their job to the highest standards.' Britons trying to get their passport renewed are furious at being left on hold for hours before being told by customer services staff working from home that they cannot access files to provide an update on applications. Among them is Mohammad Reza, a dual British-Iranian national, who told the newspaper while queuing at the Passport Office for his son's documents: 'I got through to the customer service after four hours on hold. 'One of them told me they all work from home. That's the reason why customer services have no access to the files. That's the reason why they can't give proper updates. It's shocking. Why are they still at home?' It comes after Mr Johnson delivered an ultimatum to stay-at-home officials as he threatened to 'privatise the a***' off the Passport Office and DVLA amid huge backlogs. The Prime Minister said families deserve better than the 'post-Covid manana culture' that has seen thousands of civil servants refusing to return to the office. Also in recent days, Mr Rees-Mogg warned civil servants who refuse to return to Whitehall risk losing their plum London jobs. The Conservative MP has been leaving notes on the desks of absent civil servants which read 'sorry you were out when I visited. I look forward to seeing you in the office very soon'. Mr Johnson will summon Dr Tierney for urgent talks at Downing Street next week as the Passport Office struggles to cope with high demand after five million people did not renew their travel documents during the pandemic. Downing Street chief of staff Steve Barclay is expected to meet with Passport Office officials later this week. Dr Tierney lives in a village just over 100 miles away from the London office, which takes about two-and-a-half hours to drive. Direct non-stop trains from Leicester railway station take about one hour to London St Pancras. The Passport Office is set to deal with 9.5 million applications this year - up from four million applications in 2020 and five million in 2021 when Covid-19 restrictions were in place. Holidaymakers in Britain are now being advised to leave at least ten weeks to get a new passport, but MPs have said this target is being regularly breached. ",
  "cac59921b348d8071e26f8c7a93fbcc1083ffc0710ec32e0992c3458": "Russian sources have published a list of what they claim are 100 British 'mercenaries' fighting in Ukraine, including the name of one woman.  It comes on the news that a British father has been killed in Ukraine and a second Briton is missing after the pair apparently joined local forces fighting Russia.  Scott Sibley, a veteran of the British armed forces who served in the Commando Logistic Support Squadron in Afghanistan, has been named as the first UK casualty in Ukraine.  A pro-war Telegram channel called Rybar with almost 400,000 subscribers claimed the 100 British citizens whose names were published were part of the 'International Legion of Territorial Defence of Ukraine', also known as the Ukrainian Foreign Legion. The list does not include the name of Scott Sibley and it is unclear how authentic it is.  'On April 5 we said that there were less than 700 people there, excluding employees of PMCs [private military companies],' said a report from the pro-Putin Russian channel. 'Now you know their names, dates of birth and ID numbers.' It is unclear where the list came from but Rybar suggests it was obtained via the offices of the governor of Mykolayiv region, Vitaliy Kim. The names do not include British fighters recently detained by the Russians in Mariupol. The publication of the list comes on the same day Ukrainian military officials released pictured and revealed names of Russian soldiers dubbed the 'Despicable Ten' accused of carrying out war crimes in Bucha. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defence released the names and faces of the men, stating: 'Ten Russian butchers from the 64th brigade have been identified and named suspects responsible for committing the Bucha massacre. 'This unit [has] been awarded for its atrocities, and returned to the battlefield. Justice for war criminals is inevitable.' The UK's Foreign Office confirmed that British national Sibley had been killed in Ukraine and the whereabouts of a second Briton is unknown. It is thought that the two men had been fighting against Russian fighters after joining Ukrainian soldiers as volunteers, but this remains unconfirmed.  Friends of Sibley, fondly nicknamed Sibs, have paid tribute to the veteran, who is believed to have died on 23 April, and set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for his funeral. 'Scott was a son, father, brother and uncle,' his friend Craig wrote on the page. 'To me he was a friend like no other and the bravest person I've had the pleasure to have known, he was as good as a brother to me. 'His life may have been cut short but he lived to the full and did things the Sibs way, right until the end.' Another fundraising page set up for Sibley's relatives described his 'infectious laugh', adding: 'We all have memories with him and he has helped us in different ways.' Sibley leaves behind his daughter who was diagnosed with stage 4 high risk Neuroblastoma, a rare form of cancer that mostly affects young children. Following her diagnosis in 2018, Sibley shaved his head so that his daughter would not feel different when she lost her hair, reported the BBC.  Sibley's former squadron, the Army's Logistic Support Squadron, paid tribute to the veteran, writing: 'This week the Sqn has lost a former serving soldier. A man that showed Commando spirit until the end. RIP. Scott Sibley.' A former comrade, Alex Darwin, paid tribute to his friend. 'Sib, I'm in complete disbelief. What a pleasure to have served alongside you, to know you and to have experienced your kind nature. 'You were there for me and I will forever be grateful. One hell of a beautiful guy, inside and out.' There was no reply last night from Scott Sibley's family home - a humble end of terrace house on a council estate in the village of South Killingholme, near Immingham, North Lincolnshire. It is understood Scott grew up in the area with mum Mary, dad Melvin, known as Mel, and sister Victoria. Locals said Scott had left the family home and understood he had been living in London with his own family. Neighbour Tracey Mcinanny said: 'They are away. They have gone down to be with Scott's family. We only know what we have heard on the news. I believe he went to Immingham School. His dad, Mel, works away. I have lived here several years and they were here when I got here. 'I assume they have gone to London to be with the kids Scott had. Like most kids, he had moved away from his parents to get on with their lives. 'It is very sad. But the guy thought he was doing what was right. 'I remember Scott as an older teenager. I did not know him but him and his sister seemed nice, quiet kids. 'They kept themselves to themselves. Both parents were working. You always hear about the bad kids but never Scott or sister.' The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) did not provide details on why the men were in Ukraine. 'We can confirm that a British National has been killed in Ukraine and are supporting their family,' a FCDO spokesperson said. Speaking of the second British man, the spokesperson said: 'We are aware of a British National who is missing in Ukraine and are supporting their family. We are urgently seeking further information. '  A number of Britons travelled to Ukraine after Russia invaded the country on February 24 to fight on the front lines against Vladimir Putin's men. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had called for foreign fighters to join his country's defence against Russia in the days after the invasion. Downing Street has strongly advised against Britons from travelling to Ukraine to fight, whilst serving members of the British Armed Forces have been banned from doing so. Earlier this month, Britons Aiden Aslin, 28, and Shaun Pinner, 48, were captured by Russian forces and have since been paraded on Russian state media where they pleaded to be swapped for a pro-Kremlin prisoner. Aslin and Shaun Pinner last week asked on Russian state television for UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson to intervene and ensure they were exchanged for Vladimir Putin's ally Viktor Medvedchuk, who is being held by Ukrainian authorities. Pinner is a former Royal Anglian soldier and has made clear he considers Ukraine his second country, where he married. The UK's Foreign Enlistment Act blocks citizens from joining foreign militaries fighting countries at peace with Britain, and the government's foreign secretary and defence minister have warned against Britons fighting in Ukraine after the war began in late February.  Just days after the invasion on February 24, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss was criticised after she said she would 'absolutely' support Britons who chose to help the war effort. 'People can make their own decisions,' she said. 'The people of Ukraine are fighting for freedom and democracy, not just for Ukraine, but for the whole of Europe. Absolutely, if people want to support that struggle, I would support them in doing that.' The UK Government website warns: 'If you travel to Ukraine to fight, or to assist others engaged in the conflict, your activities may amount to offences against UK legislation and you could be prosecuted on your return to the UK.' At the outset of the invasion, Ukraine encouraged foreigners to offer their support. President Zelensky has claimed 16,000 foreigners have travelled to Ukraine to resist the Russians. In March, groups of British men gathered outside the Ukrainian embassy in London to offer their support.",
  "83fa235b98f540b9910812dc7f3a6009bf340f13f928f85bd8034211": "Labour last night admitted it had lied about an event at which Sir Keir Starmer is alleged to have broken lockdown rules.  In a sensational U-turn, Labour acknowledged that Angela Rayner was also at the event on April 30 last year at which Sir Keir was filmed enjoying a beer with officials at a time when indoor socialising was banned.  A Labour spokesman said last night: 'Angela was present.' A party source claimed the previous denials had been 'an honest mistake'.  It directly contradicts assurances given to the Daily Mail over the past three months that Mrs Rayner was 'not there'.  The admission came only after this newspaper confronted Labour officials with video evidence that Mrs Rayner had joined Sir Keir at an online rally for activists filmed in the Durham offices of Labour MP Mary Foy where the party leader was later seen drinking.  The extraordinary revelation raises questions about whether Labour's deputy leader also broke lockdown rules. A woman MP has claimed a Shadow Cabinet minister said she was a 'secret weapon' because men wanted to sleep with her.  The member of Sir Keir Starmer's top team is alleged to have made the lewd comment after the woman was described as a 'rising star' of the party at an event.  The Welsh MP, who wants to remain anonymous, told the BBC that before she could reply, the frontbencher intervened to describe her as 'a secret weapon'.  He said 'women want to be her friend' and, using a swear word, that men want to sleep with her, before adding: 'She is a vote winner.'  The MP said she chose not to make a formal complaint.  Labour said yesterday that the issue would be taken 'extremely seriously' if one was received. Labour leader Sir Keir said: 'I'm deeply concerned to hear these suggestions and these allegations. There is a complaints procedure and I want everybody to have the confidence to use that procedure because I would want to get to the bottom of this and do something about it.'  Labour MP Jonathan Ashworth said the party should investigate even if a formal complaint had not been made.  Conservative MP Brendan Clarke Smith said last night: 'For all their sanctimony about honesty and transparency, it's plain to see that Labour have not told the truth about Keir Starmer's lockdown drinks party.  'Why would they lie about Angela Rayner's presence if they thought the event was legal? It makes you wonder what else they are hiding.'  In another astonishing development, the Mail can reveal that Mrs Foy was forced to apologise this week after launching a 'drunken' tirade on the Commons terrace against 'Men want to sleep with you' slur Tory MP Richard Holden, who has led calls for Durham Police to reopen the case.  Last night Mrs Rayner was also facing questions over her denials that she had joked with Tory MPs about crossing and uncrossing her legs to distract Boris Johnson in the Commons.  The claim in The Mail on Sunday provoked a storm of criticism on social media this week and a demand from the Commons Speaker for the newspaper's editor to explain himself.  Mrs Rayner described the article as 'desperate, perverted smears'. But The Daily Telegraph yesterday revealed it had spoken to two Tory MPs who corroborated the claim that Mrs Rayner had joked about giving the PM 'a flash'. Separately, The Mail On Sunday has now spoken to four Tory MPs who have all supported the account and contradicted the insinuation by Mrs Rayner and her allies that the claims were cooked up by sexist colleagues.  On a day of shame for Labour:   The Daily Mail first asked Labour on January 14 whether Mrs Rayner had been present at the notorious Durham drinks event.  A senior Labour official replied: 'Goodness me, with all that's going on. It's an old story! Angela wasn't there. It was Mary Foy's office.'  But rumours about Mrs Rayner's presence at the meeting persisted. She was pictured in Durham at an election event with Sir Keir early the following morning. And a woman whose head can be seen from behind in the video of Sir Keir has hair which bears a remarkable resemblance to Mrs Rayner's striking red locks.  The Mail presented officials with video evidence that Mrs Rayner had also been present at the Durham Miners Hall that evening.  Sir Keir gave a six-minute speech at the venue to an online party rally. Later in the event, Mrs Rayner appeared on screen in front of the same background Sir Keir had sat in front of 20 minutes earlier.  And she even confirmed exactly where she was, quoting the motto of the Durham Miners. 'Being here at the Miners Hall in Durham, I've got to start with 'the past we inherit, the future we build',' Mrs Rayner said.  Labour yesterday refused to answer a string of further questions from the Mail about the event, which police are now under pressure to investigate.  In January, Sir Keir said: 'We were working in the office. We stopped for something to eat and then we carried on working. No party, no breach of the rules and absolutely no comparison with the Prime Minister.' It can now be established that the online event finished at around 9.20pm, about 45 minutes before Sir Keir was filmed by a passerby drinking from a bottle of beer. Labour officials refused to say how long the 'meal break' lasted, or how many attended.  They also refused to say whether anyone in the leader's office had since spoken to Durham's Labour police and crime commissioner - but denied suggestions she had also been present that evening.  Durham Police said this week they would consider a request from Mr Holden to review their controversial decision that Sir Keir had not broken any rules.  Senior Tories demanded a full investigation, saying there appeared to be no difference between the event and the socalled 'birthday party' in No10, for which Mr Johnson was fined PS50.  Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said detectives should launch a full investigation, adding: 'A consistency of the application of the law, that's what we all deserve - whether we're in London or whether we're in Durham.'  Mr Johnson's spokesman said: 'The PM thinks the law should be applied equally at all times.' 'We made a mistake. Angela WAS present': Labour makes humiliating U-turn after Mail proves Rayner was at 'beergate' event under police review By Martin Beckford for the Daily Mail The WhatsApp message sent by a senior Labour press officer could hardly have been clearer. Asked by the Daily Mail if the party's deputy leader Angela Rayner had been present at the Durham Miners Hall the evening Sir Keir Starmer enjoyed a beer with local MP Mary Foy and other comrades, the spokesman replied categorically: 'Angela wasn't there.' But now that simple claim has been undermined, ironically by Labour's own digital campaigning prowess. Last night, in an astonishing volte-face, Labour belatedly admitted that Mrs Rayner had been there, but gave no further details. The party's about-turn came after a Mail investigation had already established that despite the denials, the party's deputy leader had been in the Miners Hall. Almost a year since the fateful event, when lockdown laws at the time banned indoor socialising except within a household or support bubble, the party's Facebook page still shows a video that proves Sir Keir and Mrs Rayner were in the same building at the same time. It can be revealed today that less than an hour before the infamous video was taken of Sir Keir with bottle in hand, he and his deputy sat at the same desk to address Labour activists across the country. They were the star turns in a live online rally being held less than a week before the country went to the ballot boxes in the pair's first major electoral test. It was advertised by frontbencher Nick Thomas-Symonds in a social media post that can still be viewed today. 'Tune in 8.30pm-9pm tonight for Labour's Get Out The Vote '6 Days to 6th May' rally with Keir Starmer, Angela Rayner and special guests,' he wrote on Twitter on the afternoon of Friday, April 30. He helpfully included a link to the Facebook page hosting the virtual campaigning event, which not only remains online but includes a complete video of the 48-minute proceedings. It was hosted by Labour MP Carolyn Harris, broadcasting from her home in Wales. She made it clear the rally was live by announcing: 'Well, hello everyone and welcome to the very last Friday before May 6.' After her introduction she handed over to Sir Keir, who was wearing the same open-necked white shirt which would later be seen in the clip filmed by passers-by as he drank a bottle of beer. As he addressed voters by webcam, he was sitting in a small room with white walls and a mirror on a mantelpiece that showed the reflection of a distinctive 'half round' fanlight window. Sir Keir gave a six-minute speech to the 16,000 watching online, saying: 'Let me just start by thanking every single person who's on this call this evening. Thank you for joining us.' He said the party was facing 'huge, huge elections', the first since the 'devastating' national poll in December 2019 - which saw Boris Johnson rout his predecessor as Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. Sir Keir claimed the upcoming elections would pit his Labour Party against a 'Conservative Party that's up to its neck in sleaze'. After the rally heard from other speakers, including one in the US, host Miss Harris handed over to the final speaker - Angela Rayner. She appeared on screen in front of the same background Sir Keir had sat in front of less than 20 minutes earlier - the same white walls, the same mirror on the mantelpiece and the same window in the reflection. And she even confirmed exactly where she was, quoting the motto of Durham Miners. 'Being here at the Miners Hall in Durham, I've got to start with 'the past we inherit, the future we build',' Mrs Rayner said. As well as hosting the 'Pitman's Parliament' in decades gone by and being the headquarters of the Durham Miners' Association, the grand Edwardian building is also used for constituency meetings by Mrs Foy. And it is where the party has admitted Sir Keir was when he was caught enjoying a drink with colleagues, including Mrs Foy, in an apparent breach of Covid rules at the time as well as government electioneering guidance that stated: 'You should not meet with other campaigners indoors.' That video was shot a little after 10pm - less than an hour after Mrs Rayner addressed the online rally from a room there. Photos of the hall show that its ground floor has the same distinctive fanlight windows that can be seen in the background of Sir Keir and Mrs Rayner's pieces to camera. The full 43-second clip of the video revealed by the Mail this week shows Sir Keir in another room of the hall, swigging from a bottle of beer and listening to Mrs Foy while two men eat food by the doorway. A woman sitting facing the two Labour MPs had been named by social media users as Joy Allen, then campaigning to be Durham crime tsar. But she has denied being present and the evidence obtained by the Mail suggests the woman is Mrs Rayner. When this newspaper first asked the party's press office in January about Mrs Rayner's possible presence, the reply was unequivocal: 'Angela wasn't there.' But the deputy leader had also shared photos and videos of herself with Sir Keir in the building at the same time. She was wearing the same polka-dot dress as she wore during the online rally and earlier that day while out canvassing hundreds of miles away in Birmingham. The next day - at 8.53am on Saturday, May 1 - she posted two photographs of herself in front of miners' lodges banners at the hall and wrote: 'Last year was the first year in two decades that I couldn't come to Durham. It's good to be back!' Then at 9.45am she shared a video - which again is still online - of herself and Sir Keir touring the building which Labour claims she had not stepped inside. It began with him declaring: 'On International Workers' Day, we're at Redhills, the historic Durham Miners Hall.' Mrs Rayner was filmed outside the building saying: 'From here in Durham to the miners in South Wales, it was working people and trade unionists who created local healthcare systems that laid the foundations for our country's greatest institution, the National Health Service.' The morning after the indoor event, Sir Keir and Mrs Rayner were pictured in hard hats and hi-vis jackets as they visited a major building development in Durham, known as Milburngate. Revealed: Damning testimony from four MPs of Angela Rayner's vulgar joke about Sharon Stone ploy By Glen Owen and Dan Hodges for the Daily Mail Angela Rayner last night risked accusations of a cover-up over the sexism row that has convulsed Westminster. Labour's deputy leader had described a story in last week's Mail on Sunday - which said she had joked with Tory MPs about crossing and uncrossing her legs to distract Boris Johnson - as 'disgusting' and 'completely untrue'. Amid a storm of criticism on social media, Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle demanded a meeting with the newspaper's editor David Dillon. Mr Dillon rejected the call, saying that journalists should 'not take instruction' from parliamentary officials. Yesterday The Daily Telegraph reported that two Conservative MPs had told the newspaper they had heard Mrs Rayner laughing publicly about the idea that she could put off the Prime Minister by 'giving him a flash'. The witnesses said she had been joking about the suggestion that she was crossing and uncrossing her legs during a light-hearted discussion on the Commons terrace about two months ago. Separately, The Mail On Sunday has now spoken to a total of four Tory MPs - the original source and three others, including one woman - all of whom supported this account and contradicted the insinuation by Mrs Rayner and her allies that the claims were cooked up by sexists. One of the MPs, describing a night on the Commons terrace earlier this year, said Mrs Rayner had initiated the discussion of the issue. They said she had spoken of giving the Prime Minister 'a flash'. A second MP claimed that Mrs Rayner had referenced the thriller Basic Instinct, in which Sharon Stone's character infamously uncrosses her legs while being interrogated by police. 'Angela told us: 'I like to do my Sharon Stone trick to distract Boris... I cross and uncross my legs',' the witness said. A third MP added that they also remembered the encounter. The original source for the Mail on Sunday story said that the 'Sharon Stone' joke had been made while Mrs Rayner spoke to a Tory MP. 'She was telling him how she distracts Boris,' they said. All four Tories gave almost identical accounts of her remarks. They each said Mrs Rayner had used a startling slang colloquialism during the discussion. When The Mail on Sunday approached Mrs Rayner last Saturday about the exchanges on the terrace, a Labour spokesman said: 'It's completely made up, so unless they're going to say something properly on the record or have any evidence I would expect that this made-up story wouldn't run. 'I'm telling you categorically it's untrue so I'm afraid you know that doesn't meet the bar, an unnamed source without any evidence... I'm telling you, it's categorically untrue that this has happened.' After Mrs Rayner strenuously denied making the remarks, coverage of the story initially concentrated on allegations of sexism. The row then saw Sir Lindsay attempt to summon The Mail on Sunday's editor for a meeting. However, on Wednesday the Daily Mail revealed that Mrs Rayner had in fact publicly joked about the Basic Instinct comparison herself in January. Speaking to Matt Forde for his Political Party podcast, she volunteered the fact that her appearances in the Commons had prompted online references to the 1992 movie thriller. 'Every time I do a Prime Minister's Questions somebody has an opinion on what I wear. Did you see the meme about Sharon Stone like I was doing it at PMQs? I was mortified,' she said, laughing. 'I wasn't aware I did it but apparently there was this whole meme about how my dress was a bit revealing. I didn't think it was. It was a perfectly suitable Karen Millen - in the sale by the way.' The podcast also saw her use the same slang colloquialism MPs say she used on the Commons terrace. Meanwhile, as the backlash grew over Sir Lindsay's intervention, Mr Dillon formally turned down the Speaker's request for a meeting, saying that Britain's free Press would not endure if journalists had to take instructions from officials in the House of Commons. He also said other MPs had come forward to corroborate the original account of Mrs Rayner's remarks. The Prime Minister later backed Mr Dillon's decision. A No 10 spokesman said Mr Johnson would not want 'any perception of politicians seeking to in any way curb or control what a free Press seeks to report'. A spokesman for Mrs Rayner last night declined to comment further on the story. Labour's own partygate: Keir Starmer flouted Covid lockdown guidance at own birthday bash... with TWO cakes By Harriet Line, Chief Political Correspondent for the Daily Mail Sir Keir Starmer was last night accused of hypocrisy for attending a birthday cake celebration in his office during the pandemic. The Labour leader tucked into the shop-bought chocolate and lemon cakes while coronavirus guidance advised against holding close social gatherings indoors. Sir Keir has repeatedly demanded Boris Johnson quit for attending an impromptu birthday gathering in the Cabinet Room in June 2020 - just three months before his own celebration. The PM and Chancellor were hit with fines for breaking lockdown laws that banned indoor gatherings at that time. However, it has now emerged that Sir Keir was given a birthday card and two cakes in his office on his birthday in September 2020. While Covid laws on gatherings had been relaxed a month earlier, government guidance at the time stated that people should not 'hold or attend celebrations (such as parties) where it is difficult to maintain social distancing and avoid close social interaction'. 'This is the first time in the history of our country that a Prime Minister has been found to be in breach of the law, and then he lied repeatedly to the public about it. Britain deserves better, they have to go.' Sir Keir Starmer, April 12 'Now we know the Prime Minister did not shut down his own birthday party... he spent it breaking the law. We have a Prime Minister who is sorry only that he has been found out.' Angela Rayner, April 21 'We are all concerned by the situation in Ukraine, but that should not be used as a smokescreen for the failings of this Prime Minister.' MP Matt Western, April 21  The Government also said people should not 'socialise indoors in groups of more than two households'. It was not clear last night how many others helped Sir Keir to eat the cakes in his office.  A Tory source said: 'It now seems that, as well as sinking a few cold ones with mates at his infamous Durham drinks party, Sir Keir flouted the guidance in place for a little birthday bash... that is of course unless you believe that he popped out to a shop, bought himself a cake and sat alone eating it in his office. 'We know that Labour have lied about these things in the past so it makes you wonder what else they're hiding. The stench of hypocrisy gets stronger by the day.' Sir Keir claimed the Prime Minister and Chancellor 'dishonoured their office' by attending the impromptu birthday celebration on June 19, 2020, the day Mr Johnson turned 56. Rishi Sunak was in attendance because he had been invited to a crucial meeting about Covid. Mr Johnson was eating a salad. It was initially believed that the PM had been presented with a Union Jack cake while aides sang 'Happy Birthday' to him.  However, it has since emerged that the cake - bought by a special adviser - never even left its Tupperware box. Some sausage rolls from Marks and Spencer were laid out on the Cabinet table along with a few cans of Estrella lager, but it is believed that these too were left untouched.  Nevertheless, Sir Keir claimed Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak's attendance had 'dishonoured' the sacrifices made by people during lockdown - as well as their offices.  After the men were fined, Sir Keir said: 'This is the first time in the history of our country that a Prime Minister has been found to be in breach of the law, and then he lied repeatedly to the public about it. Britain deserves better, they [the PM and the Chancellor] have to go.'  Labour did not respond to a request for comment last night. However, a party source said no laws were broken.",

Jon Venables and Robert Thompson, both 10, killed two-year-old James Bulger in Merseyside in 1993. They were released on licence after serving eight years in secure children's units and were given life time anonymity. Venables, 39, has since been returned to prison twice for child abuse images and is still behind bars. But he has launched a bid for parole and could be freed later this year. Now, James' father Ralph has called for Venables to be stripped of his anonymity.  He has also called for a public inquiry, while revealing that a debate on the murder of his son and its aftermath is now being considered by the House of Commons' Petitions Committee. He said told the Mirror: 'A public inquiry is long overdue so we can flush out the truth about so many issues. 'But top of my list must be why Venables is still one of the very few people in this country who still has lifelong anonymity despite his repeated offending against children. 'I don't buy the argument that his life would be in danger. If that was the case, they would have to give secret identities to every child abuser and killer in the UK.' A petition in 2018 called for a Public Inquiry into the murder received over 210,000 signatures. However the government rejected the call but the Petitions Committee agreed MPs could discuss the issues in Parliament - which is now set to happen in 2022.  Mr Bulger said he wants a probe into the decision behind releasing the killers after just eight years and would like people to be made accountable. He also said that from 'day one' he thought the attack on his son had a sexual motive, and has also called for an investigation into the killers motives and separately about why his family were not given counselling after their son's death. Jon Venables and Robert Thompson were found guilty of killing Bulger in November 1993 and were freed in 2001, aged 18. They were given new identities to protect them from the risk of vigilante attacks and were made the subjects of so-called 'Mary Bell orders', lifetime anonymity court injunctions. At the time of Venables' first release from prison, a psychiatrist ruled that he did not pose a danger to the public and was extremely unlikely to commit any further offences. Years later it emerged Venables had been detained in Vardy House - a small eight-bed section of Red Bank secure unit in St Helens on Merseyside - where it's said he made such good progress he was kept there for eight years, despite it actually being a short-stay remand unit. Venables' release under his new identity went ahead and he is known to have been living independently by March 2002 - some time thereafter beginning a relationship with a woman who had a five-year-old child, although he denies having ever met them. He was then reported to have had a number of 'younger girlfriends' which suggested he was enjoying a delayed adolescence. He developed drinking and drugs problems, and he compromised his identity at least twice by telling friends he was a convicted murderer. In September 2008, he was arrested on suspicion of affray after a drunken brawl and was given a formal warning by the probation service for breaching the good behaviour terms of his licence. Later the same year, Venables was cautioned for possession of cocaine after he was found with a small amount of the class A drug. When a probation officer later visited his home in Cheshire to discuss his fears that he could be in danger, he was attempting to destroy the hard drive of his computer. The hard drive was later examined by police, who discovered that it contained dozens of indecent images of children. Venables admitted he had posed online as a 35-year-old woman who had abused her eight-year-old daughter, and was returned to prison. During his latest imprisonment he was given yet another new identity because of the risk posed by a previous security breach. Venables was paroled again in 2013 and took on his fourth new identity. He was sentenced to 40 months in prison after pleading guilty to having more than 1,000 indecent images of children, in February 2018. While Robert Thompson has not re-offended since being released on licence when he was 18 years old. Though in 2006, reports claimed Thompson was in a stable gay relationship at age 23 and had settled well into his local community in the North West.  The murder of James Bulger was a vicious crime that shocked Britain. Jon Venables and Robert Thompson were both 10 years old on February 12, 1993, when they abducted the two-year-old before brutally torturing and killing him. The crime made the boys the youngest killers in modern English history. The duo snatched James from outside a butcher's shop in Bootle, Merseyside, in 1993, while his mother popped into a store for just a few seconds. James' mutilated body was found on a railway line in Walton, Liverpool, two days later.  The boys were playing truant from school, and CCTV showed them observing local children at the shopping centre, appearing to be 'selecting a target'. They were then captured on camera taking the boy away at 3.42pm, before leading him on a two-and-a-half mile walk through Liverpool to the village of Walton. Venables and Thompson were seen by 38 people during the walk, and were twice challenged by bystanders because James was crying and had a bump on his forehead. But they were able to convince the concerned people that James was their little brother and continued on their way. They led James to a railway line near the disused Walton & Anfield Railway Station where they began torturing him - including throwing paint in his eye, pelting him with stones and bricks and dropping an iron bar on his head. After the body was found, police launched an appeal showing the low-resolution CCTV images of the boy. The breakthrough came when one woman recognised Venables, who she knew had skipped school with Thompson on that day, and contacted police. They were charged with murder on February 20 and forensic tests confirmed they had the same paint on their clothes as was found on James' body. Around 500 protesters turned out for their initial magistrates' court hearing due to the public outcry against the crime. The subsequent trial at Preston Crown Court and the boys were considered to be 'mature enough' to know they were doing something 'seriously wrong'. Venables and Thompson were found guilty on November 24, 1993, with the judge describing them as 'cunning and wicked'. Reporting restrictions on their names were also lifted as it was considered in the public interest to do so. Their parents were moved to different parts of the country and also received new identities due to death threats against them.  ",

A total of 86,100 visas had been issued by Wednesday, the Government said.  But as of Monday just 27,100 Ukrainians had arrived in the UK, according to figures from the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities and the Home Office.  This includes 11,110 through the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship route - 21.6 per cent of the 51,300 refugees with visas granted.  Around 16,000 have arrived under the Ukraine Family scheme - 45.8 per cent of the 34,900 refugees issued visas.  Overall, less than a third (31.4 per cent) of those granted visas under both schemes have arrived in the UK.  There are multiple cases where families are unable to travel to the UK because not all family members have received their permission to travel letters or visas.  There has also been widespread concern about the length of time it has taken for visas to be issued.  Home Office minister Kevin Foster said suggestions that Ukrainian children are deliberately not being granted visas to prevent their families from travelling to the UK are 'absolute nonsense'.  Speaking yesterday, he admitted that some individuals 'get a decision shortly after others in their party', adding: 'But that is not deliberate.' A government spokesman said: 'We are processing thousands of visas a day - this shows that the changes we made to streamline the service are working.'

The victim was attacked near the centre's food court and could not be saved despite emergency medical treatment provided by an air ambulance crew. Police believe it was a targeted attack. A police spokesman said: 'We have started a murder investigation following the death of a man in Thurrock. 'We were called to reports of a man injured after a serious assault inside the Lakeside shopping centre shortly before 4.30pm today. 'Emergency services attended but, sadly, the man was pronounced dead at the scene. 'It is believed he had been attacked by two men who are described as being black or Asian.

Andrew Fahie, 51, who also serves as the territory's minister of finance, was detained in Miami for money laundering and conspiring to import a controlled drug.  Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said she was 'appalled by these serious allegations', which also follow an inquiry into embezzlement by officials. She said last night: 'I have spoken to the governor of the British Virgin Islands (the Queen's representative in the territory) and he will be holding an emergency meeting of the territory's cabinet... He will set out next steps (today), including urgent publication of the inquiry's report.'  In September 2021, Fahie backed a 'self-determination' referendum that could see the Queen's removal as the British Virgin Islands' head of state.  The move came after then Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab ordered an inquiry into allegations that party officials had embezzled taxpayer money sent to help the islands in the wake of hurricanes.  The independent probe was announced in January 2021. 'The BVI is not corrupt', Mr Fahie said at the time.  'Anyone that makes that statement is trying to damage the BVI's reputation, and is an irresponsible person.'  Mr Rankin said last night: 'I realise this will be shocking news for people in the territory. I would call for calm at this time.'",

Daniel Stilitz QC, who is believed to be a Labour member himself, deleted his social media account yesterday after his anti-government posts were widely shared online. Critics accused Mr Stilitz of not showing due impartiality given his high-profile role advising Miss Gray on her much-anticipated report into alleged illegal gatherings at Downing Street during the pandemic. In other posts, Remain-supporting Mr Stilitz, of 11KBW chambers in London, said Labour MPs backing a Brexit deal were 'mugs' and retweeted a post calling Boris Johnson 'our reckless dangerous PM'. In another post, he said: 'Why not join Labour? Now seems as good a time as any.' Commenting on Brexit in 2019, he said: 'The future of the UK is collateral damage in this mad Tory fight to the death.' News website Guido Fawkes reported that another post made that year stated: 'The Government's current rhetoric is nothing compared to the bile they'll serve up during the forthcoming election campaign.' Mr Stilitz deleted his Twitter account yesterday after the comments were widely shared online.

  "38ca7eedc27ba09e8c7610d96bf510345ef77c4023318a34ec9635a2": "  Priti Patel has hailed the passing by Parliament of a landmark law that she vows will finally fix Britain's 'broken' asylum system. Writing in the Daily Mail, the Home Secretary says the Nationality and Borders Act will crack down on 'evil' people-smugglers facilitating dangerous Channel crossings. And she adds that 'for far too long, the public has been branded racist simply for wanting controlled borders'.  Her comments come after the bill finally received royal assent yesterday, having survived attempts by peers to reject key measures including the processing of refugee claims offshore. The latest data suggests no migrants have arrived by small boat for the past ten days, after the military took charge of stopping crossings earlier this year. But the Government's deal to send asylum seekers to Rwanda is facing court challenges, as is a plan to house 1,500 asylum seekers at an old RAF base in Yorkshire, despite Miss Patel insisting they will be helped to start a 'prosperous' new life in Africa. The Home Secretary writes: 'Daily Mail readers don't need to be told that the asylum system is broken.  'They can see the evidence with their own eyes: evil people-smugglers bringing migrants here illegally in small boats and on lorries; dangerous foreign criminals doing all they can to avoid being deported by putting in last-minute, meritless claims hours before they are due on the plane.' She says the plans will speed up the process for dealing with those who claim asylum in Britain. Miss Patel insists a new law was required to increase the maximum sentence for entering the country illegally from six months to four years, as well as introduce a life sentence for people-smugglers. And failed asylum seekers and foreign criminals will be removed more quickly rather than being allowed to make appeal claims up until their deportation flights. Our plan is firm, fair, and delivers on YOUR priorities By Home Secretary Priti Patel  Daily Mail readers don't need to be told the asylum system is broken. They can see the evidence with their own eyes: evil people-smugglers bringing migrants here illegally in small boats and on lorries; dangerous foreign criminals doing all they can to avoid being deported by putting in last-minute, meritless claims hours before they are due on the plane. It's been obvious for decades that things need to change. And the British people have made it clear that's how they feel. That's why I developed the New Plan for Immigration. A fair and firm system is one of the people's priorities. To put the whole plan into practice, we needed to change the law. This week, the Nationality and Borders Act completed its passage through Parliament. The maximum sentence for entering the country illegally will rise from six months to four years. And the smugglers who bring them here can now be sentenced to life in prison. Instead of a maximum sentence of six months, foreign criminals who return to the UK in breach of a deportation order may face up to five years in prison. Asylum reception centres - which are already in place in many European countries - will be used to process claims, rather than hotels. We will open one such centre in Yorkshire. One of the things that most angers people is that claims take so long. We are taking steps to improve the process, but we also need to stop the number of repeat appeals and judicial reviews - all too often aimed at delaying the removals process and usually without merit. We can now deliver proper scientific assessment processes to prevent adults from getting away with pretending to be children. Those we are seeking to remove, including foreign national offenders, will be required to present all their claims upfront, rather than raising them at the last minute. The UK keeps a list of safe countries that respect human rights, to stop people delaying removal by falsely claiming their human rights are at risk. Every EU country is on that list. We will have the power to remove as well as add countries - to ensure the list is reliable. Countries must co-operate in taking back citizens with no right to be in the UK. Those that don't will risk losing access to our visa system. For the first time, how a person arrives in the UK will affect the outcome of their claim. Anyone who arrives illegally and has passed through a safe country may be deemed inadmissible. A few weeks ago I signed a migration and economic development partnership with Rwanda, which will mean those who make dangerous journeys in small boats, or in the backs of lorries, could have their asylum claim processed in Rwanda. If their claims are accepted, they will be supported to build a new and prosperous life there. By tackling illegal migration, we will be able to focus our resources on people who genuinely need our help, such as those from Ukraine. The British people have welcomed them warmly, as they have with refugees throughout our history. For far too long, the public has been branded racist simply for wanting border controls. Yet only by controlling immigration can we do right by those who don't have the money to pay people-smugglers. It also isn't fair on British taxpayers that the broken asylum system costs PS1.5billion a year - and nearly PS5million a day in hotels. We have not reached the end of the road to reform. There is no single solution to solve a long-standing problem. There will be opposition in the courts. But we have a New Plan for Immigration that is firm and fair. And the Nationality and Borders Act means we have the law on our side.",

  "77e494d7bd7f951c1a1d6a55d51e30c5349c9cb832b110ff4f917849": "Police have released an image of the moment a masked killer who knifed a hero father to death in front of his 15-year-old son brandishes a huge knife moments before the fatal attack. Football coach Michael Fadayomi, 40, described as a 'pillar of the community', was stabbed in the neck trying to protect his son from rampaging thug Marcus Griffiths. After telling a fellow bus passenger he wanted to 'f****** kill someone', Griffiths, 43, followed the boy and a friend in Willesden, north west London, when he suddenly launched his unprovoked attack. The teenager managed to dodge the knife directed at his head twice and he and his friend ran off, calling Mr Fadayomi for help.  But the fight spilled into the nearby Grill King Shop and Mr Fadayomi was repeatedly knifed - including a fatal wound to his neck that cut an artery and caused massive blood loss. Griffiths then calmly made off from the murder scene after the 'cowardly attack', prosecutors said. Paramedics were called but Mr Fadayomi died in front of his son.  Griffiths was today jailed for life for a minimum term of 32 years at Harrow Crown Court. The unprovoked attacks began when Griffiths followed the schoolboys off the bus after they sat next to him and he suddenly turned aggressive for 'no reason'. The youngster managed to avoid two blows aimed at his head and ran from the bus stop to call his father. When 'much-loved father' and 'pillar of the community', Mr Fadayomi who lived nearby, arrived just after 5pm he went to the top deck of the bus to remonstrate with Griffiths. But as Mr Fadayomi got off and started walking down the road, Griffiths chased after him and repeatedly stabbed him from behind as he walked away and severed an artery in his neck. Police said the vicious assault was carried out for 'absolutely no reason at all' and that Mr Fadayomi was unarmed and had not shown any aggression towards the attacker. A witness who sat near Griffiths on the bus heard him say 'I'm going to kill someone today'. Griffiths was arrested later the same evening at his home not far away in Cricklewood, north west London, and denied knowing anything about the killing. CCTV footage and witness statements revealed that within moments of boarding the bus, and without provocation, Griffiths became aggressive towards the two boys. At the next stop - which was Willesden Bus Garage - they all got off the bus and the attack was unleashed. During the trial, Griffiths claimed he was acting in self-defence when he knifed Mr Fadayomi to death. But at Harrow Crown Court, Griffiths was found guilty by a jury of murder after a two-week trial. He was also convicted of the attempted murder of Mr Fadayomi's 15-year-old son and possessing a knife in public. Today at the same court he was sentenced to life in prison, with a minimum term of 32 years for murder and a minimum of 22 years for attempted murder. Kristen Katsouris, a senior crown prosecutor in the homicide unit for the CPS in London, said after the sentencing hearing today: 'This was an attack on a father who was looking out for his teenage son. 'Michael Fadayomi had simply wanted to protect his child and in doing so he lost his life. No child should have to witness the death of their parent in such cruel circumstances. 'Marcus Griffiths got off the bus and attacked Mr Fadayomi with a knife. And yet, during the trial Griffiths claimed that he had been acting in self-defence. 'When faced with the evidence, the jury were able to see through this story. 'The prosecution case included DNA evidence, video footage of the fatal incident and testimony from passengers on the bus who had witnessed Griffiths' aggressive demeanour beforehand. 'A family has lost a father, son and brother and although nothing can bring their loved one back, I hope these convictions and the sentence handed out today provides some sense of justice to the family of Mr Fadayomi. Our thoughts remain with them at this time.' Detective Constable Rebecca Corser, the investigating officer for the Met Police, said Fadayomi's son only narrowly avoided being killed himself. She added: 'This is a tragic case in which a man has lost his life for absolutely no reason at all. 'For a reason known only to himself, Marcus Griffiths was intent on causing serious harm to someone that day. Indeed, a witness who sat near him on the bus heard him say 'I'm going to kill someone today'. 'Michael Fadayomi's son and his friend had the misfortune to sit near him on the bus and he turned his aggression towards them. 'After his son narrowly avoided being killed himself, Michael came to the scene and confronted Griffiths about his behaviour. 'Michael was not armed and did not show any physical aggression towards Griffiths. In a cowardly attack, Griffiths stabbed him from behind as he was walking away from the bus. 'I would like to offer my sincerest condolences to the Fadayomi family. Nothing can be done to bring back a much-loved father, however I am glad the jury has seen through Griffiths' lies and he will now spend many years in jail.'",

The TV veteran, 51, moved fans to tears as she gave a powerful insight into her double mastectomy and breast reconstruction surgery in the ITV documentary Breast Cancer And Me, which aired on Thursday night. Viewers took to Twitter to praise Julia for sharing her 'most personal and vulnerable moments' in the 'inspirational' documentary, which saw her go topless to show new breast implant after her mastectomy. Julia, who underwent the operation and an immediate reconstruction in October after being diagnosed with breast cancer last year, showed fans the intimate moment she looked at her breast implant for the first time in the mirror. In the documentary, she admitted that the implant would take 'some getting used to' as she showed where the silicone was visible beneath her skin and spoke about the struggles of losing her breast. She admitted that she struggled to initially look at her new breast, only catching brief glimpses in the shower, saying she wanted to wait to look in the mirror until 'I was emotionally ready and when I'd physically had some time to heal'. Undoing her bra and looking at her new implant, a visibly emotional Julia said: 'There you go, there's my new boob. Ok well it looks like a boob. It looks like a big lumpy boob. 'Can't feel that at all, it might come back one day, the sensation, but I can't feel my fingertips. It looks like a plasticine boob at the moment. It's going to take a bit of getting used to.' Taking to Twitter to speak about the documentary, fans admitted they were in 'floods of tears' as they watched her breast cancer journey, praising her 'bravery' for openly sharing her journey in the powerful documentary. One viewer wrote: 'Oh Julia, your programme has me in floods of tears within moments. You're so brave to show everyone your journey. Wishing you all the love.' Another commented: 'Such an honest, powerful documentary. Julia thank you for sharing your most personal, vulnerable moments in your breast cancer journey.' A third said: 'Watching @JuliaBradbury what a brave, strong lady filming your journey! Wishing you a speedy and full recovery god bless you xx' A fourth tweeted: 'Watching the documentary. You are an inspiration. What a fantastic woman you are. Brave is an understatement.' A fifth added: '@JuliaBradbury touched by your cancer journey. Thank you for being strong enough to share so openly.' A sixth wrote: 'Incredibly brave and open of Julia Bradbury in this documentary. Hoping she recovers and there's a good ending to this sad story.' And another gushed: 'Currently watching your programme about breast cancer with tears streaming down my face. You are such an amazing, brave woman.  'Thank you for sharing your story and for being so open and honest. I hope your recovery goes well and you are able to return to full health.' Earlier in the documentary, Julia bravely went topless to show where her breasts had been marked with felt tip ahead of her double mastectomy. The markings were made for the surgeon performing her mastectomy and the Countryfile presenter bravely spoke to the camera while sitting on a hospital bed ahead of the operation. On the verge of tears, she said: 'The process of being marked up, you do feel a bit like a slab of meat. I've been pretty strong today, I haven't cried today and I've cried most days while this has been going on but today - it's a bit overwhelming the whole thing.' Elsewhere in the documentary, Julia tearfully detailed how she had to say goodbye to her children three days before her mastectomy and how she struggled with losing her breast in her new documentary, Breast Cancer And Me. She explained that due to coronavirus restrictions she was unable to see her kids and husband Joe Cunningham before the operation, as she opened up about her experience and recalled how her children asked her if her condition was 'contagious like Covid'. Mother of three Julia has candidly shared her journey with ITV viewers after first learning she had cancer in September last year, admitting that she 'didn't feel she had a choice' about going public with the diagnosis. During her experience, Julia filmed a video diary and explained how she had to hold her children for the last time three days before the surgery, she said: 'I started self-isolating this morning. I took all my kids to school and waved goodbye at the gates. Then we all knew that I wouldn't be able to hug them again until after the operation. 'It's an extra layer of complication that makes this horrible process even s****er. I don't mind saying that I'm scared now and now it's real dread that I'm feeling. You hope it's a dream and you're wrong.' The hour-long documentary opened with Julia filming a woodland segment for This Morning, when she was awaiting the results of a recent biopsy - but she refused to take the call while away from home because there was nobody she felt 'close to' that would be able to support her. Julia said: 'I was away with a new team, up trees and there were emails back and forth about when I could take this call to hear the results of a biopsy I'd had done a week before, on a lump in my left breast. 'I knew I wouldn't be able to take the call because I wasn't prepared for it to be bad news and I wasn't with someone I knew, to be able to ask to take some time out to process it. After waiting to take the call at home, Julia recalls how she was told their was a 'big tumour' in her left breast, adding: 'So I thought I'd delay that until I was back. I was ready for the call and I was here at home, it was a sunny day and my consultant called and said you do have cancer. And it's a big tumour.' Julia, who shares her kids - Zephyr, 10, and twins Xanthe and Zena, both seven, with husband Joe Cunningham, kept her diagnosis hidden for a while because she didn't want her children to hear the news from anyone else. She said: 'When you hear the words 'you've got cancer', your world stops. It is like moving instantly into slow motion. Just thought s**t, okay, I've got to live. I need and want to be here. 'I didn't want the information about my breast cancer to be out there before I told my children, I didn't want them to hear mummy's got cancer from someone else. I kept it to myself until I made sure everything was right at home with my family.' Julia and her husband 'came to parenthood late in their lives', and welcomed their son when she was 40 years old and then their twin daughters through IVF three years later.  Explaining that it broke her heart to consider leaving her children, Julia said: 'The most painful thing of it all was my children and the thought of leaving them behind. The most joyful thing about motherhood is watching them develop. 'They're at these gorgeous ages where every day is a little landmark. One of my little girls [Zena] is very shy, so watching her overcome something at school, every moment with her when she puts her hand up against her instincts.' 'My little boy Zeph is a little bit cheeky which we love, Xanthe is a little chatter boy, you think are you ever going to stop talking? You have these gorgeous moments with them when they're little. This makes a cancer diagnosis - for me - just made it so so sad.' Julia also revealed that when she told her husband Joe, he was 'devastated' but told her that they would get through it and be able to look after the children. The Countryfile host went on to discuss how the couple told their children about her diagnosis and admitted that although they didn't want to say she would die - they didn't want to lie to them either. She explained: 'We decided to take them for a walk around the garden - because that's where they feel comfortable and happy - and just be honest with them. Say that mummy's not very well and mention the cancer word. 'I remember my little girl - I'll try not to cry, said 'Can I still hug you. I was like yes of course you can, I want you to hug me tighter. One of the hardest things in my life was telling my children I've got cancer.' Julia went on to explain how the next step of her journey was working out a treatment plan with doctors, of what and when they can operate. At this point Julia was told she was going to have a mastectomy. She said: 'They said if we take away the breast tissue we might be able to save your skin and nipple. That word - amputation of the breast - it's shocking, it's absolutely shocking. 'I was told that it was possible for me to have reconstruction at the time of my mastectomy because of the type of cancer I have. As long as the tumour could be removed safely. I was told the tumour is probably contained and we'll be able to take it out in one, we don't know its spread so we'll take out a lymph node to check. Admitting she was shocked by the news, Julia said: 'A silicone implant? What's that going to look like, how's that going to feel? And then you're like 'f****', wow.' Julia was told by a nurse during filming that she would need to take six weeks off for recovery because it is a 'big operation'. Detailing how the consultation made her feel, she said: 'You just don't have any idea of how this is going to unravel, you're really in the dark about how you're going to feel, emotionally and physically.' Julia described the feelings of loneliness, and said: 'You think about, chemotherapy, losing parts of your body, has the cancer spread? For someone who is in control, you feel alone and helpless. The mother of three explained that her mum Chrissi, 84, has previously battled bowl cancer and her father Michael, 81, has survived prostate cancer. She has previously told how she believes the birth of her first born Zeph saved the lives of her parents who 'pulled through' to meet her little boy. Julia said she didn't tell her parents for a while and explained why: 'I knew if I just told her look I've been for this biopsy, and it's some sort of cancer but I don't know what yet. To my mum that's like a death sentence.  'Her mind would go and she'd want to come and live with me straight away and come to every single appointment. Which is lovely, but for her own health, she's in her 80s and had her own stuff going on.' The documentary then sees Julia cooking in the kitchen with her mother, who tells the camera that she has come even though her daughter didn't want her to, because she 'couldn't stay away any longer'. When asked how it feels knowing Julia has cancer, Chrissi said: 'It's like having it all over again to be honest, and I do believe that the worst thing is now waiting. I am now looking forward to recovery. When you recover you have to stop working, you've got to stop rushing about. It's important to prepare your body for what's going to happen.' The mother and daughter are then seen sharing an emotional embrace, before Chrissi said: 'When she told us she had been diagnosed I was shell shocked, I can't tell you how I felt. I didn't even know myself and still don't. If someone had said can you take it away from her and you have it, I'd of said yes. While her Dad added: 'It did help that Julia tackled it head on my coming to see us, we can't put ourselves in her shoes. We don't know when she's feeling scared or vulnerable. All we can do is be there and provide whatever you can.' Household name Julia, who has been on British TV screens since 1996, went on to admit that she 'didn't feel she had a choice' about going public with her breast cancer diagnosis. She said: 'I wanted to give an open and honest account of what I was going through. The statistic is one in seven women will get breast cancer in their lifetime. It's the club nobody wants to be in. I suppose like most members of this club, I didn't think I'd get in.' In a video entry 10 days before her surgery, Julia said: 'It feels like I'm part of some really bad game show. Like the hunger games or something. Even though this op is hopefully going to get rid of the cancer, fingers crossed it hasn't spread. 'It's hopefully going to save me, I feel my hand moving to my boob and holding it - knowing it's not going to be or feel the same again. You're really scared, shocked and frightened, and loss.' Following her diagnosis, Julia decided to return to her woodland documentary filming for the final time before her operation, and speaking in the voiceover she said she hopes she doesn't come across as a 'blubbering wreck' while filming live for This Morning. A producer can be seen on the woodland set telling Julia that the majority of the segment will focus on the forestry, but the presents may ask how she is at the end. Sharing her vulnerability before the show airs, Julia said: 'If you asked ten people what they thought of Julia, five would say annoying, brash and all of that stuff. Others would say positive, loud, energetic, determined... but not vulnerable, scared.. those would not be some of the adjectives used. I'm not used to that I suppose. Even to my family I don't like to show that side.' Julia filmed the segment with hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield.  Back in the woods, Julia can be seen discussing the upcoming interview with host Holly Wil who kindly told her: 'We're going to say are you okay - you can answer whatever you want, we're not going to push.' Julia added: 'You talk about things a different way on camera, its as if you're talking about someone else and you're looking at them and feeling sorry for them. But that other person is me. So it's weird place to be in.' The following scene showed Julia in hospital - accompanied by her older sister Gina - as a nurse marked up where the surgeon needed to remove a lymph node to check if the cancer has spread. Julia looked tearful as they completed the mark up on the location of her nearest lymph node, so that they were able to easily locate it when they operated the following day. She later said during a confessional that she felt the experience tipped her over the edge because it was a reminder of what the surgeons would be doing to her the following day.  She explained: 'I felt suddenly overwhelmed then when she exposed my breast. I just thought that's what's going to happen tomorrow morning. That was just a bit more emotional than I thought it would be. It's my last day of being me and having my full body and boobs.  'When I lay down and she exposed my breast, I'm not shy it's not about body image, I just thought when she did it and started touching about that area, that's what they're going to be doing tomorrow. Chopping it open and taking it away, taking the cancer away but changing me forever. 'My surgeon has been in and marked up my body, you feel like you've been tattooed a bit, he explained that he just wants to get the symmetry right because when you lay down it looks different. It's a weird process. 'I've been pretty strong today, I don't think I've cried today. I've cried most days while this has been going on. But today I'm a bit, it's overwhelming, but for all the women who have gone through it and will go through it, this is the best possible thing to get me through to the other side.' In a happier scene, Julia was seen reuniting with her two daughters after she returned home from hospital, who she hadn't spoken to since leaving as they thought a video call while away may have been upsetting. She said: 'I'm back home, I've had a little nap and my girls have come home from school, and I'm going to surprise them - with cuddles on the bed! 'This is the longest time I've ever gone without seeing them, we didn't video call while I was in hospital because I didn't want to scare them. Julia then started to cry with happiness at seeing her girls again, as she told them to be gentle with her as she showed them the supportive bra she has to wear for a while during her recovery. A few weeks into her recovery, Julia admitted she hadn't yet looked at her new breast while it was 'angry and sore', and was yet to stand in front of a mirror to properly inspect the implant. Julia said: 'I wanted it to be when I felt emotionally ready and physically I had some time to heal. After revealing her new breast she said: 'Okay well it looks like a boob, like a big lumpy boob.' Touching it, she added: 'I can't feel that at all, it might come back one day the sensation. But strangely I can't feel my fingertips at all. It looks like a PlasterScene boob at the moment. It's going take a bit of getting used to.' During the post operative consultation, the consultant told her the whole tumour was removed was taken but she has 'potential micro invasion'. After admitting she had felt 'very, very nervous' that morning, Julia is told that the whole area was exorcised and they wouldn't be considering any invasive treatment such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy. He went on to explain that there was a small area of 'potential micro invasion', which means a small amount of cells had spilled into the substance of the breast and he told her to consider a preventative drug, but it isn't without risks, which include flushing and sweating and aggravating endometriosis as well as rarely inducing tumours in the lining of the womb. Julia admitted she was scared of her cancer 'reoccurring' as she detailed the next steps of her journey. She said: 'I wish I could say I've had my mastectomy and the prognosis is really good and I can just get on with my life now, but the reality is that there is a chance of the breast cancer coming back. The reoccurrence risk is the thing that hangs over me. 'I will be throwing myself into research about my kind of cancer, so I'm peeing on sticks and spitting into tubes, having bloods and speaking to as many people as possible about everything related.' The results of a sophisticated 'SNIPS' test revealed that Julia currently does not need to consider having her right breast removed, as she is told by a professional that she is not 'high risk' for secondary cancer. Reflecting on the news, Julia said: 'The most important thing is not to get cancer again. The period of time is usually five years. My children are 10 and six, they're babies. Five years is nothing in their lives. I need to live more than five years. 'When people talk about recovery and the treatment is good, the survival is good. I don't think there's enough emphasis on what recovery is. On what handling breast cancer is all about. I'm trying to learn to handle that. 'I have a lot to process and a lot to really understand now I'm post mastectomy, I have to learn to love my new breast and get physically fit again. I really want to know how to deal with the future, the question mark of reoccurrence.' During a therapy session, she confessed: 'It's still very fresh, coming to terms with it all. Your body and life changes in a few weeks. So I sit here as a new person, with a new bit. I've lost a bit of me as well.' 'I do also think about other ladies going through this who have had a worse or more aggressive diagnosis than me. That makes me sad, I feel like I should be very grateful for where I am and my cancer experience.' 'Everyone around me, family, partner, parents, loved ones.. it's crashed into their lives as well. I feel sad that I've brought this into their lives.' Julia, who explained that she is starting to feel sensation again in her breast, told how her little boy had asked her if the cancer was 'contagious like Covid'. She said: 'I was reading to him in bed and he said to me, is it contagious mummy - like Covid? I said no sweetheart, it's this different thing. He'd obviously been thinking about it. We've all been going through it together and it's hard to know as a parent if you're getting it right. Talking to them about cancer in the right way, what is the right way?' Towards the end of the episode, Julia attended a session with her children and other families which helps them to understand more about the condition. She then spoke about how she plans to move forward in the future, and said: 'How is this going to affect them in five, ten years time - I can't answer that right now. But I hope we've handled it pretty well. I hope I'm still alive in ten years to ask them the question. But you just do the best you can. 'There's still disbelief that I'm in that room with those mums and parents as one of them. Cancer is a lifetime diagnosis, it's not dealt with after treatment. You need to learn to deal with it for the rest of your life. That's a big learning curve for me. 'Cancer has put me on a different footings, it's completely changed my life. Life is incredible precious. I have three amazing children I have to live for. I want to take this horrible thing that has happened and turn it into something positive. The simple and small and ordinary things are the most important things.' On Thursday's episode of This Morning Julia and Holly Willoughby were moved to tears as they discussed Julia telling her children about her breast cancer. The Countryfile star told how difficult it was to tell her children about her cancer battle, with one asking her if the disease is 'contagious'. She said: 'Telling your children you have cancer is the hardest thing you will ever have to do in your life you have to be realistic but protect them and I don't think any parent knows what to do.  'One of my children said, 'Can I still hug you?' and the other said, 'Is it contagious?' I never thought about either of those two things.  'You just don't know what's going through their mind. You do your best, but it's a very difficult thing to navigate.'   Julia added her kids have been 'amazing', saying: 'They've made friends with my new boob! They say, 'Mummy, it doesn't feel the same' and I say, 'No it doesn't, but I'm here and that's what it's done.'' Julia also explained she didn't tell her mum the diagnosis until she knew herself what the plans were for treatment, because she knew she would worry so much. She said: 'My mum is a Greek-living. gorgeous, warm parent who tries to protect us to this day. 'I have to phone her when I get somewhere I knew if I told her she would want to know what was happening next she would want to move in with me, I knew it would be a huge worry for her at that stage.'  Julia encourages women to get themselves checked if they find a lump or notice a change in their body.   She said: 'I've been honest about the discovery of my lump from the very beginning because I've always been a campaigner for cancer.  'My mother had cancer, my father had cancer, so I've been an ambassador for several cancer charities throughout my career and ironically I am an ambassador for ovarian cancer in the UK.' She added: 'But when I did discover the lump, I was very open about having mammograms and encouraging women to go to the doctor if you find something - trust your instincts and I even posted a picture on my social media accounts of me having a mammogram. It was just a natural progression from that. 'I even posted a picture of me having my mammogram and it was just a natural progression for that, it just seemed like the right thing to do. 'I know that by being open for this people know I am there with them and it has broken down some stigma by talking about it.'   Julia admitted she often thinks about 'five-year terms' since her diagnosis. She said: 'It's completely unbelievable until you're in that situation you don't know how you're going to react. You immediately think about death...there are very few people who live through a cancer diagnosis and never think about it again. 'You think about five-year terms, when you talk about survival rates that's what you're talking about...what about living with the reality of cancer which is you will never be able to forget it.   Julia recently said she was unsure whether she would ever travel or wear a bikini again following her breast cancer diagnosis. She spoke to Hello! magazine from Mauritius where she was on holiday with her partner Gerry and their children., She said: 'I have this feeling of embracing everything now, grabbing everything that life has to offer with open arms. 'I wasn't sure that I would ever travel again - and certainly wasn't sure whether I'd wear a bikini ever again.' Julia added she had always appreciated the 'healing power of nature' and did so even more now. 'I'm still at the acute end of coming through my diagnosis and coming to terms with everything, so life is very heightened,' she said. 'The skies are a deeper shade of blue, the patterns of nature are more striking than usual. I'm taking it all in.' The broadcaster said she was using her illness as an opportunity to 'reset' her emotional and physical health and now practises meditation and gratitude every day, sleeps at least eight hours each night and has cut out almost all alcohol. She added: 'It will be a long time before you find me dancing on tables again - and I love dancing on tables.' Julia also told how she had promised at the beginning of the holiday to agree to any of her children's requests, from swimming to trekking or eating ice cream but only one a day. She added: 'They are this size for such a short time: you blink and they're gone. 'I want to enjoy every one of those moments and they're even more magnified and precious now.'   It comes after Julia wore a bikini for the first time since undergoing the procedure, as she holidayed in Mauritius, and admitted she feels 'fortunate' to have had immediate breast reconstruction. The TV personality took to Instagram where she shared a gorgeous shot of herself in a blue bikini and beach cover-up in matching print, while relaxing in the sunshine   Julia penned: 'I had no idea what life after a #mastectomy would be like. I feel incredibly grateful that some things have gone my way during my #breastcancer diagnosis. Each of our stories is different... 'I was fortunate to be able to have immediate recon after my breast was removed containing a 6cm tumour.   'Nothing prepares you for the shock & impact...& yet but here I am in a bikini again. Didn't think this would happen. 'Wearing wraps helps too. Of course it's @melissaodabash!! Thanks @gaylerinkoff for finding me new. #gratitude #breastcancer #recovery #bikini #mauritius.'   Her holiday snap comes after Julia revealed that the risk of her cancer is returning is higher than average and detailed her experience learning to love her body after a mastectomy in a candid chat. Six months after undergoing her surgery, the presenter is now having to come to terms with the knowledge that she does not yet have the 'all clear' from doctors. Julia revealed to You magazine that she has 'micro-invasions' - tiny fragments of cancerous cells which have leached out of her milk duct and into her breast tissue. Furthermore, genetic testing has shown that she has a higher than average risk of her cancer coming back.   She explained: 'I'm in the top five or six per cent of women in the country in terms of the likelihood of recurrence. 'That puts me in the 'moderate risk' category - higher than the average woman - but, look, it's about percentages and perspectives. 'The doctors have not found a huge spread of an aggressive cancer. I have lost my breast but been able to have an implant and keep my own nipple. 'I feel lucky and grateful every single day, and I have to learn to live with this risk, to accept the fragility of life, without it consuming me.' Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. Each year in the UK there are more than 55,000 new cases, and the disease claims the lives of 11,500 women. In the US, it strikes 266,000 each year and kills 40,000. But what causes it and how can it be treated? What is breast cancer? Breast cancer develops from a cancerous cell which develops in the lining of a duct or lobule in one of the breasts. When the breast cancer has spread into surrounding breast tissue it is called an 'invasive' breast cancer. Some people are diagnosed with 'carcinoma in situ', where no cancer cells have grown beyond the duct or lobule. Most cases develop in women over the age of 50 but younger women are sometimes affected. Breast cancer can develop in men though this is rare. Staging means how big the cancer is and whether it has spread. Stage 1 is the earliest stage and stage 4 means the cancer has spread to another part of the body. The cancerous cells are graded from low, which means a slow growth, to high, which is fast growing. High grade cancers are more likely to come back after they have first been treated. What causes breast cancer? A cancerous tumour starts from one abnormal cell. The exact reason why a cell becomes cancerous is unclear. It is thought that something damages or alters certain genes in the cell. This makes the cell abnormal and multiply 'out of control'. Although breast cancer can develop for no apparent reason, there are some risk factors that can increase the chance of developing breast cancer, such as genetics. What are the symptoms of breast cancer? The usual first symptom is a painless lump in the breast, although most breast lumps are not cancerous and are fluid filled cysts, which are benign.  The first place that breast cancer usually spreads to is the lymph nodes in the armpit. If this occurs you will develop a swelling or lump in an armpit. How is breast cancer diagnosed? If you are confirmed to have breast cancer, further tests may be needed to assess if it has spread. For example, blood tests, an ultrasound scan of the liver or a chest x-ray. How is breast cancer treated? Treatment options which may be considered include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormone treatment. Often a combination of two or more of these treatments are used. How successful is treatment? The outlook is best in those who are diagnosed when the cancer is still small, and has not spread. Surgical removal of a tumour in an early stage may then give a good chance of cure. The routine mammography offered to women between the ages of 50 and 70 mean more breast cancers are being diagnosed and treated at an early stage.

  "18eacec09f11a1cd9a3f2ee2c8067845820ca07d9a920b5a8ce87cb9": "Premier League Productions, the top flight's international broadcaster, has axed a number of reporters and presenters in a radical overhaul that has left them open to allegations of 'rank hypocrisy'. In a huge shake-up, a number of full-time staff and freelancers were 'brutally' told their services would no longer be needed via a series of Zoom calls, insiders have disclosed. From next season the broadcaster is moving away from their normal offering of studio news and analysis shows and moving to what has been described as 'timeless, digital content'. That means that a number of well-known faces, along with production crews, camera operators and logistics staff have been told that they are not having their contracts renewed or that their hours will be drastically reduced. 'A lot of people who work four, five days a week have been told they won't be required next season, or possibly just for matchdays and pressers,' one source explained. They added that many 'saw the iceberg coming' at a mass Zoom call when the shift in programming was announced. That was followed up by further calls to the many who had been impacted to outline a bleak future. 'It was brutal,' they said. Another insider also hit out. 'The way that longstanding staff have been treated is absolutely outrageous,' they said.  'It's rank hypocrisy. There are vast amounts sloshing around the Premier League and yet staff are treated like this. Some good people stitched up. It's not right.' PLP, as it is known, is run by IMG Media for the Premier League.  A joint-operation, it produces and distributes all of the Premier League's international programming, including the broadcasting of all 380 Premier League matches. The likes of Kelly Cates, James Richardson, Seema Jaswal and Mark Pougatch have all worked on studio productions for the broadcaster. An IMG spokesman said: 'Premier League Productions aims to deliver the best possible programming output for international broadcasters and football fans around the world.  'Together with the Premier League, we regularly review our content portfolio and are evolving our offering for the next season.  'As a result, there have been some small changes to the staffing structure to meet the new operational requirements.' IMG insiders insist that the PLP headcount across the businesses is growing. However, one member of staff hit out. 'It's not small changes to the staffing structure,' they said.  'This has impacted serious numbers who, in the climate we are in, are now effectively jobless. It stinks.'",

Madelaine McTernan has been appointed the new HRT tsar and will spearhead efforts to deal with shortages of the medicine.  She helped lead the Vaccine Taskforce, and has been credited with playing a crucial part in Britain's Covid jab success, working to secure vaccine supplies.  Now, she will turn her hand to helping thousands of menopausal women up and down the country who have been struggling to get hold of hormone replacement therapy, mostly due to problems with supplies of a popular oestrogen gel.  Some have resorted to meeting up in car parks to swap medication, or trying to get it from pharmacies abroad.  Other members of the Vaccine Taskforce have also been redeployed to tackle the HRT crisis, as the Government redoubles its efforts to ensure women can get hold of the medication.  Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said: 'I understand how much women rely on HRT which is why we will leave no stone unturned to help make sure women can get the HRT they need. 'Madelaine McTernan will use her excellent skills and expertise to build on the success of the Vaccine Taskforce to bolster supply of vital medicines to women across the country.'  Demand for HRT has risen dramatically, with a 38 per cent increase in the number of prescription items over the past seven years.  The HRT taskforce will be responsible for working with suppliers to find out what can be done to reduce shortages in the short and long term.  Miss McTernan, a Cambridge law graduate who went on to work in investment banking, will remain director general of the Vaccine Taskforce but be primarily focused on HRT supply for the foreseeable future.  'We will apply the key learnings from the successful way the Vaccine Taskforce have procured life-saving vaccines during the pandemic to help ensure women have reliable ongoing access to these critical medicines,' she said",
  "abcee5de40a856c65b708ea3893342dbb1663cbdac5f923098789c21": "A Labour MP launched a 'drunken tirade' against the Conservative MP leading calls for the police to review claims Sir Keir Starmer broke lockdown rules. Three witnesses told the Daily Mail that Mary Foy vented her fury at Richard Holden on the Commons terrace on Tuesday night. She is said to have verbally abused him for asking Durham Police to reopen the investigation into footage of the Labour leader having a beer with officials in her office on April 30, 2021. Witnesses claim the City of Durham MP grabbed Mr Holden by the arm with both hands and tried to drag him across the terrace before staff restrained her. Each witness said the former charity worker, 54, appeared to have been drinking heavily when the incident took place at around 10pm as MPs waited for late-night votes. Mr Holden confirmed he had received a written apology from Mrs Foy the following morning. He said: 'Mary has apologised for her totally unacceptable, drunken behaviour on the terrace and I want to leave it at that.' A Tory source said Mrs Foy's behaviour suggested the 'pressure is showing' on Labour as Durham Police face calls to finally launch a proper investigation into Sir Keir. Mrs Foy declined to comment on the allegations when contacted yesterday and referred all questions to Labour's press office. A party source confirmed she issued a personal apology. The source said the pair had been drinking together in a group where there was 'a bit of back and forth on politics generally'. They added that it was 'incorrect' to say Mrs Foy had grabbed Mr Holden's arm, but did not comment on claims she was drunk. But several witnesses said they were shocked by the ferocity of her tirade. One added: 'She came storming over and just started shouting at him in the most abusive way, swearing at him and accusing him of dragging her into the whole Starmer thing. 'It took place in her office so she's maybe worried that if he gets fined, she'll get fined. He was doing well staying calm and making the point that his target wasn't her, it was Starmer. 'But she was steaming. She grabbed his arm and her staff had to pull her away. One of them came back and was very apologetic. Her behaviour was completely outrageous. If a male MP had behaved to a female MP like that, they'd have been hauled before the Speaker.' A second witness said: 'She was screaming at him, 'How dare you name me and my office in this?' She was finger-jabbing and shouting. 'He was trying to stay calm and be polite but she was very aggressive - she was obviously drunk and feeling the pressure.' A third source said: 'Her staff were trying to restrain her but she just kept going. She was saying some pretty slanderous things and he told her that if he didn't have an apology by the morning, he'd be reporting it to the Speaker.' Last year, Sir Keir and deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner took part in a virtual election event for activists from Durham Miners Hall, where Mrs Foy's constituency office is based. Mrs Foy was later seen chatting to Sir Keir while he enjoyed a beer in her office - at a time when indoor social gatherings were banned. Labour has insisted the footage - filmed by a passer-by - was a brief interlude in a 'work event'. Durham Police dismissed calls to investigate after reviewing the video in February. But Mr Holden asked the force to reopen the inquiry in light of fines issued to Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak over a meeting involving cake in June 2020.",
  "72616c4e1d527c7a4188ed43db3f9ff29950f4135b43e72322b315a6": "Offensive or shocking beliefs can be acceptable in a democratic society, an employment judge said yesterday, as she ruled a pastor was discriminated against for his views about gay Pride events. Keith Waters, 55, a minister at an evangelical church, claimed he was 'forced out' of his caretaker job at a primary school following a single tweet. He wrote: 'A reminder that Christians should not support or attend LGBTQ 'Pride Month' events held in June.  'They promote a culture and encourage activities that are contrary to Christian faith and morals. They are especially harmful to children.' The comments were condemned as homophobic and triggered a vicious backlash, including a campaign of harrassment in which undertakers were sent to Mr Waters' home to 'discuss his funeral'. Isle of Ely Primary School in Ely, Cambridgeshire, began an investigation but the married father-of-one resigned three weeks after the tweet - a day before he was due to face a disciplinary hearing.  Cambridge Employment Tribunal has now ruled he was the victim of indirect discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief. Judge Sarah King said a 'widely shared belief demands particular care before it can be condemned as being not worthy of respect in a democratic society'.  She added: 'Beliefs which are offensive, shocking or even disturbing to others can still be protected.' After the ruling, Mr Waters said it was 'an important win for our freedom to speak the truth of the gospel without fear of losing our jobs'.  He added: 'I took legal action, not because I wanted to sue the school but because what happens to me goes to the heart of what it means to be free to preach the gospel in the UK.' Mr Waters, who founded the New Connexions Free Church in Ely in 2007, made the tweet in June 2019 - the month Cambridge was hosting its first ever Pride event. The school received three formal letters of complaint - one claiming he had called for 'violence against people who support the Pride Festival'. The tribunal did not uphold claims for direct discrimination and unfair dismissal. The Christian Legal Centre, which supported Mr Waters' case, yesterday said his 'words and intentions [had been] distorted, his character assassinated.'  A spokesman for the Active Learning Trust, which runs the school, said: 'We welcome the decision of the employment tribunal that the claims of direct discrimination and unfair dismissal were not well founded and were dismissed.' Compensation will be determined at a later date.",
  "e66227b33120fc859cc20905bef55ab8d23f9417cd2845ae821c6b99": "Network Rail failed to tell emergency services that power lines were off leaving paramedics waiting for a critical 16 minutes before they could attempt a rescue a visually impaired passenger, inquest hears.  Blind Cleveland Gervais, 53, was struck by a train after he fell onto the tracks shortly after 7pm at Eden Park station in southeast London on 26 February 2020. He was trapped under the third carriage of the stopped train close to two live rails but emergency services only extricated him once it was confirmed that power had been cut off.  Network Rail knew at 7.07pm that someone was trapped under the train and the power was switched off, but it was not until 7.21pm a rail officer confirmed this.  Once it was, a paramedic crawled under the train to reach the fallen victim and pulled him out and over the rail into an awaiting stretcher. By the time he was rescued, Mr Gervais' heart had stopped. Network Rail, who manage stations and tracks, admitted to the coroner's court that 'potentially' the power lines should have been switched off but also said London Ambulance Service should have told them they were on their way.  The 53-year-old regularly used public transport but was blind with light sensitivity only in his right eye and reduced acuity and tunnel vision in his left eye. Daniel Matthews, Control Operations Manager for Network Rail, was not in the control room at the time of the incident but gave evidence as an expert witness. When Coroner Catherine Wood quizzed why Network Rail did not tell all the emergency services that the power was off, Mr Matthews said: 'I can't explain why they didn't or why that wasn't done at the time. He added: 'Potentially the team should have done that. I can't comment on why the team didn't consider calling British Transport Police back to say, 'this is the latest update'.' He also said that, according to protocol, the London Ambulance Service should have notified Network Rail that they were on their way to the incident - but this did not happen. The emergency services waited until Rail Incident Officer (RIO) Scott Debell was on the scene to test the live rail with specialist equipment before going onto the tracks. Asked by Coroner Catherine Wood whether he knew the power was on at the point he arrived, Mr Debell replied: 'When on site we always check with the signal and control if the power is on or off. 'Normally it's switched off. It's no surprise when we arrive on-site and it's an emergency and it's switched off.' The coroner asked: 'Why do you always check?' 'It's normal procedure for a RIO to check the rail for an extra safety measure,' Mr Debell replied. 'A lot of emergency services asked us about the power and it's peace of mind for them to prove that the power is actually isolated when we can show it with our device.' 'Were they waiting for you to check before they did anything further?' said Coroner Wood. Mr Debell replied: 'Yes, they were waiting.' Jude Bunting, QC, representing Mr Gervais' family, said: 'It was clear to you that power had already been turned off.' 'That's correct,' said Mr Debell.  'And therefore, it wasn't necessary for the emergency services to wait for you,' Mr Bunting continued. 'No,' said Mr Debell. He said that the lawyer representing the British Transport Police, asked each witness from the emergency services if it was necessary to wait for the ROI because no one else could confirm the power was off. 'It wasn't necessary to,' the witness said. 'If the power lines had been turned off is there any risk in going down to track?' asked Mr Bunting. 'Only tripping hazards,' replied Mr Debell. But he told the inquest that he has never been in a situation before when the emergency services have to directly touch the third rail to get to a casualty and they have started before the ROI arrived. When responding to jury questions, Mr Debell was able to recall an instance when the third rail tested live after the Network Rail electrical control room confirmed it was switched off. Dr Simi George, who confirmed the post-mortem examination, told the inquest that the cause of Mr Gervais' death was 'multiple traumatic injuries'. She said the major findings were the amputation to the leg and a pelvic fracture which was found upon internal examination, but there was 'no major trauma to the main organs'. Dr George said: 'My conclusion was, given the extent of the damage with fractures to the limbs and pelvis and with exposure of muscle, bone and soft tissue, the cause of death would have been major haemorrhage leading to death. 'It was most likely to be some form of haemorrhage or hypovolemic shock due to multiple traumatic injuries.' She added: 'There was presence of alcohol but not in fatal range and cannabis metabolites, but I don't believe they were in any significant amount to associate with death.' His blood alcohol level was just 20 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood - far below the legal drink-drive limit of 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. Mr Bunting asked: 'Is it correct that you considered that the real cause of death was blood loss?' 'Yes, I believe it was blood loss,' responded Dr George. But she was unable to tell how rapid blood loss would have been from the post-mortem examination. The inquest continues.",
  "68b4aede57cf4d6a004fd398b90321a11435f0bc7b7d9e58512fa670": "A paedophile nurse who downloaded baby rape images was struck off but the married father-of-four has avoided jail.   Christopher Ewan, 45, who used to work in A&E, downloaded more than 100 child rape files, plus extreme porn images showing bestiality.    His innocent wife and children were forced to flee the family home in Netherton, Merseyside after it was targeted by vigilantes who vandalised it.   Ewan's wife has since left him and he has 'lost' his children, a court heard. His defence lawyer told the court Ewan's interest in adult porn was in the 45-year-old's words 'thrill seeking' and progressed to viewing child sex abuse images.  Ewan's computer had 137 Category A images, including 10 videos which are seen as the most extreme forms of abuse and involve children being raped.  Along with the suspended sentence he was also ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register and comply with a Sexual Harm Prevention Order for 10 years.  The former Aintree Hospital nurse has also now been officially prohibited from practising nursing in the UK.  The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC), which regulates the register of nurses able to practise in the UK, published a judgment from a disciplinary hearing which concluded Ewan would remain a potential risk to patients if he was not struck off. An independent panel concluded: 'Children suffer harm as a result of indecent images being made, possessed and distributed. Offences involving indecent images of children exploit children and amount to an abuse of children. 'It is therefore not guaranteed that a member of the public in Mr Ewan's care would be safe, or indeed, feel safe, in his care. 'The panel therefore determined that Mr Ewan is liable to place patients at a risk of harm in the future, that his conviction, for such serious and morally culpable offences, has brought the nursing profession into disrepute and breached fundamental tenets of the profession.' The panel heard that Ewan, who had worked at Aintree since 2013, was referred to the NMC by both Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Merseyside Police. Back in September, the court heard Merseyside Police officers knocked on the door of Ewan's home on June 22, 2020, after receiving a tip-off about 'suspicious activity' relating to a Sky broadband account and messaging app Kik Messenger.  Officers seized various devices, which were later found to contain 137 Category A images, including 10 videos. Category A images are classed as depicting the most extreme forms of abuse under sentencing law and involve children being raped.  The police also found 219 Category B images, including two videos, 130 Category C images, one pseudo (cartoon) image of abuse and 21 extreme pornographic images. Christopher Hopkins, prosecuting in court, said during the sentencing hearing that one Category A image showed a female baby aged six to 12 months and one Category A video, around 24 minutes long, featured children aged eight, seven and four. Mr Hopkins said: 'So of their type, they are particularly serious images in the Crown's submission.'  In a pre-sentence report Ewan claimed he did not intentionally download the images or do it for sexual gratification but later admitted that was not true.  Desmond Lennon, defending, said: 'He unreservedly accepts deliberately downloading this material.  'He also accepts at the time there was a sexual interest in children and the notes indicate, being pressed, accepts it remains.' Mr Lennon said Ewan was married for 19 years with four children, but developed an interest in adult porn, which the dad described as 'thrill seeking'. He said at the time of the offending his client had been off work due to 'stress' and his interest in adult porn progressed to viewing child sex abuse images. Mr Lennon said if Ewan was spared jail, he could receive 'the assistance he perhaps now belatedly recognises that he needs'.  The lawyer said: 'He understands how it's not only affected him, but people who are very important to him, his wife and children. His wife has left him, the marriage is over and his four children have been taken away from him.' Mr Lennon said when Ewan's crimes first became public knowledge, it had a 'catastrophic effect' on the family, who then lived in Netherton.  He said: 'The home was vandalised, bricks were thrown through the window, paint was thrown at the front door and people congregated outside, behaving in an intimidating way. The effect on his children in particular has been devastating.' Judge Anil Murray told Ewan: 'You were of previous good character. More than that, more than just having no previous convictions, you were of positive good character and worked as a professional person. By this offending you have thrown all that away.' Judge Murray said by law he had to consider guidelines on whether this sentence should be served immediately, and because Ewan had no history of poor compliance with court orders, was thought to have a realistic prospect of rehabilitation, and jailing him would have 'some significant impact' on his family, he was 'able, but only just, to suspend the sentence in this case'. He was handed a suspended prison sentence at Liverpool Crown Court in September, having admitted three counts of downloading and one count of possessing indecent images of children, plus possessing a prohibited image of a child and extreme porn.  He handed Ewan 10 months in prison, suspended for two years, with a 40-day Rehabilitation Activity Requirement. ",
  "821a006efea1bcc51708fe9d02b62482f370cc9400373c4102554527": "Vladimir Putin will launch an all-out nuclear war on the West rather than accept defeat in Ukraine, Russia's chief propagandists have declared, in just the latest chilling threat coming from Moscow. Margarita Simonyan, editor of state broadcaster RT and one of the Kremlin's highest-profile mouthpieces, declared on TV last night that the idea of Putin pressing the red button is 'more probable' than the idea that he will allow Russia to lose the war. 'Either we lose in Ukraine,' she said, 'or the Third World War starts. I think World War Three is more realistic, knowing us, knowing our leader.  'The most incredible outcome, that all this will end with a nuclear strike, seems more probable to me than the other course of events. 'This is to my horror on one hand,' she told a panel of experts shifting nervously in their seats, 'but on the other hand, it is what it is. We will go to heaven, while they will simply croak... We're all going to die someday.' Simonyan's calm imagining of nuclear holocaust is just the latest threat issued from the top levels of the Russian state, after fellow propagandist Vladimir Solovyov, foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, and Putin himself issued threats in the last 48 hours. The US and UK have dismissed such rhetoric as bluster but the increasing frequency of the threats coupled with the failures of Russia's military will raise fears that a Cold War-style standoff is now a realistic possibility before the war in Ukraine ends. It comes after Russia successfully test-launched its latest nuclear missile - Sarmat 2 - last week, with Putin boasting it can strike targets anywhere on earth and cannot be stopped by any current missile defences.  Lavrov was the first to raise the nuclear threat in an interview on Russian state TV late Tuesday, when he was asked whether the current standoff between east and west could be compared to the Cuban missile crisis at the height of the Cold War. The foreign minister responded that the current situation is more dangerous, because the weapons involved are more powerful, the controls on them more lax, and communication between the two sides is non-existent. 'During the Cuban Missile Crisis there were not many 'written' rules. But the rules of conduct were clear enough.  'Moscow understood how Washington was behaving. Washington understood how Moscow was behaving. Now there are few rules left,' he said. Asked directly about the threat of nuclear war, he added: 'The risks are very significant. I do not want the danger to be artificially inflated [but] it is serious, real. It cannot be underestimated.' That was followed by off-the-cuff remarks from Solovyev while discussing the deployment of Sarmat 2 with the head of the Roscosmos space agency, who said the missile will go into service later this year.  'As it turned out, one Sarmat means minus one Great Britain,' Solovyov boasted, suggesting the UK deserves to wiped off the map because it has become 'totally boorish' - in what appeared to be a reference for this country's support for Ukraine. Dmitry Rogozin, head of the Roscosmos space agency, told Solovyov that 46 of the missiles will be constructed with the first deployed to units in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, later this year. 'Everything is according to plan with us,' he said. 'It is all according to plan.' That was then followed by a threat from Putin himself, who vowed a 'lightning-fast' response to any country who directly intervenes in the Ukraine conflict. 'If someone intends to interfere in what is going on from the outside they must know that constitutes an unacceptable strategic threat to Russia,' he said during a meeting with lawmakers in St Petersburg. 'They must know that our response to counter strikes will be lightning fast. Fast. 'We have all the weapons we need for this. No one else can brag about these weapons, and we won't brag about them. But we will use them.' Putin did not directly mention nukes, but his phrasing appears to be a clear reference to the new Sarmat missile which he boasted is unlike any other weapon in the world as it was tested last week. It also echoes a threat that Putin made as he declared the start of his 'special military operation' back in February, which was that any country seeking to interfere would face consequences 'never seen before in their history'. The nuclear threats from state media also echo a wider narrative emerging from the Kremlin's propaganda machine which is that Russia is now engaged in a full-scale conflict with NATO that pre-sages a Third World War. Olga Skabeeva, another state TV host and Kremlin mouthpiece, declared on Tuesday that a summit of 40 defence ministers in Germany held to coordinate arms deliveries to Ukraine was effectively a declaration of war. 'They declared a war,' she told viewers. 'World War III, no longer just a special operation, with forty countries against us.' Political scientist Mikhail Markelov agreed with her, declaring that those 40 countries are 'today's collective Hitler'. Dmitry Kulikov, another state media personality, also repeated the line. 'This is a big war,' he said. 'The West declared it against us.  'Let's be worthy of our predecessors, everyone who lived through that. What made us think that our lives should be better than those of our grandparents?  'Why should we be free of our historical mission?' Russia is now more than two months into what was supposed to be a days-long 'special military operation' to topple the Ukrainian government and install a puppet regime loyal to Moscow. Ahead of the war, most experts and observers predicted Ukraine's military would survive only a few days or weeks against the onslaught, but troops have defied the doubters and remain in control of most of the country 62 days later. Having failed in its aim of taking Kyiv, Russia is now concentrating its forces in the east in the hopes of seizing control of the Donbas region and encircling a large part of Ukraine's ground forces. Moscow's generals have also said their aim is to push out from Kherson - on the Black Sea coast and the only major city to fall to Putin's forces so far - and capture Mykolaiv and Odesa, cutting Ukraine off from the ocean. But Western nations have rallied to support Kyiv, with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin declaring earlier this week that Ukraine will be given all the weapons it needs to 'win' the war and 'weaken' Russia to the point where it cannot attack again. Liz Truss, British defence secretary, explicitly spelled out the victory condition in a speech last night - saying arms deliveries will 'keep going further and faster to push Russia out of the whole of Ukraine'. That would mean not just re-taking the parts of Ukraine Russia has occupied since Putin ordered the invasion in February this year, but re-taking the parts attacked and annexed since 2014 - namely Crimea and rebel-held areas of Donetsk and Luhansk. Ms Truss argued that the war could last for ten years, but that the West must be prepared 'for the long haul.' If Putin succeeds in his war aims, she warned, then there will be 'untold further misery across Europe and terrible consequences across the globe'. Some of those consequences took shape this week as Russia began cutting off gas supplies to Europe - something it has long-threatened to do but which was considered a remote possibility because of the damage it would do to the economy. Poland and Bulgaria both had their gas supplies cut on Wednesday, sending the wholesale price soaring and threatening to inflict further financial pain on Europe as it recovers from Covid and deals with inflation. Germany - which is highly dependent on Russian gas after years of foreign policy moves designed to forge ties with the Kremlin - now fears it will be next. Experts have predicted that such a move is likely to plunge Germany's economy, the world's fourth-largest, into a recession. Italy an Austria could also be targeted. Moscow is demanding that all countries must now buy its gas in rubles in an attempt to shore up its currency after it was hammered by Western sanctions over Ukraine. One expert told the Times that most European Union importers were 'extraordinarily' likely to give way to Russia. Hungary, whose president Viktor Orban has warm ties with Putin, is already thought to have found a work-around to the demand.  The Russian move is forcing governments across Europe to speed up a switch to alternative supplies. Western officials say that this represents a major strategic failure for Moscow. One UK official said: 'This will be one of the major strategic developments from this campaign and it will be a failure for Russia because it will reduce its income and also compromise its offensive capability. 'This is one of the costs we are inflicting on Russia. Long-term sanctions will have the same effect. The Prime Minister has said Russia must be seen to have failed.' Britain's Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab slammed Russia's decision, saying it will add to its status as an 'economic and political pariah'. President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said Russia's attempts at 'blackmail' were doomed to fail. She called it 'unjustified and unacceptable' and said it pointed to Russia being an unreliable gas supplier. The EU was prepared for this scenario and contingency plans are in place to get gas from alternative sources and maintain maximum gas storage levels. Poland and Bulgaria are already receiving gas via their EU neighbours, including Greece. Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki was applauded by MPs in parliament when he said the 'blackmail' would have no effect. Bulgarian prime minister Kiril Petkov said that it was a 'gross violation'. And despite Bulgaria taking nearly 80 per cent of its gas from Russia, he added: 'We won't give in to such racketeering.' While there was a 20 per cent price hike in European wholesale gas prices in early trading, much of this fell away later in the day. But despite many countries in Europe rallying together, four major gas trading companies have bowed to pressure to pay for Russian supplies in roubles through back channels, a report by Bloomberg claimed yesterday. The names of the buyers and countries have not been revealed. However Slovakia, which is heavily reliant on Russian gas, previously suggested it may be forced to comply with demands.",
  "40cb83928e04d6fcaf12b02882df5ded263223259b82d400b2cc375d": "While most people in cities will be unsurprised to learn they live in an area with high air pollution, the full extent of the problem in the UK has been revealed. An analysis by the Central Office of Public Interest (COPI) has revealed how 97 per cent of UK addresses now breach at least one of the World Health Organisation's limits for toxic pollutants. Meanwhile, nearly 75 per cent of us live in areas that breach limits of all three toxic pollutants - nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) and particulate matter 10 (PM10). COPI has created an interactive tool that lets you check what the air pollution levels are at your address, as well as its ranking relative to other addresses in the country. Humphrey Milles, founder of COPI, said: 'Air pollution affects all of us. It's a group one cause of cancer, just like asbestos. 'With this new accurate data now publicly available, it would be shameful for the property industry to not start acting transparently. Lives depend on it. Everyone has a right to know what they're breathing before they buy or rent.'  PM is a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air. They are created from a variety of sources, including traffic, construction sites, unpaved roads, fields, smokestacks or fires. Most particles form in the atmosphere as a result of reactions of chemicals such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.  Some PM, such as dust, dirt, soot, or smoke, is large or dark enough to be seen with the naked eye.  Other PM is so small it can only be detected using an electron microscope.  PM2.5 - of diameters that are generally 2.5 micrometers and smaller - differ from PM10 - 10 micrometers and smaller. Source: US EPA  COPI sourced and mapped the air pollution levels recorded at 20,000 sites in over 320 UK council areas. Using this data and DEFRA-approved council monitor data, experts at Imperial College London generated a national model with an incredible 20m/sq resolution. The interactive tool, which can be accessed at addresspollution.org, reveals how air quality varies across the UK. For example, Buckingham Palace, which is in the heart of London, falls into the 98th percentile, with some of the highest air pollution levels in the UK. In contrast, Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire has some of the cleanest air in the UK, and falls into the lowest percentile. Unsurprisingly, major cities across the UK have some of the highest levels of air pollution. However, some addresses in Kent, Bath and East Anglia were also found to fall into the top percentile for dirty air. 'We all have our own part to play in this. Air pollution isn't insurmountable and we can all do something about it,' Mr Milles said. Last year, a Southwark coroner ruled that air pollution contributed to the 2013 death of Ella Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, nine, who lived 80ft from the South Circular road in Lewisham, south-east London. As part of the ruling, he asked the Government to explain how it would prevent future deaths - leading to the pledge from ministers to set aside an extra PS6million for local authorities to improve air quality and raise public awareness. The coroner's report, following a second inquest which ruled that air pollution contributed to Ella's death, called for legally binding goals for dangerous pollutant particulate matter (PM2.5) that are in line with WHO guidelines.  These suggest keeping an average concentration of PM2.5 under 10 micrograms per cubic metre of air (ug/m3), to prevent increased deaths.  Rosamund Kissi-Debrah, Ella's mother, said: 'This data shows yet again that the government is failing the British public. 'Now people can really see the filthy air they're breathing at their home, school or work address, and it is no wonder that the NHS waiting lists are ever growing. 'Everyone needs to know what they're breathing, and now with this new public service they can.' Professor Sir Stephen Holgate, special advisor on air quality to the Royal College of Physicians, added: 'Air pollution is an invisible killer, and because you can't see it it's easy for people to forget and ignore. 'It's essential that the public are given air pollution data for where they are thinking of buying or renting. In many cases like that of little Ella, it can be a matter of life or death.' In June it was revealed that tougher air pollution laws would be brought in following the death of a girl from an asthma attack caused by traffic fumes. A Southwark coroner ruled in December 2020 that air pollution - including illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide - contributed to the 2013 death of Ella Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, who lived 80ft from the South Circular road in Lewisham, south-east London.   The nine-year-old died after suffering three years of seizures and nearly 30 visits to hospital for treatment to breathing problems. The council admitted pollution levels were a 'public health emergency' at the time of the schoolgirl's death but it failed to act on it.  Coroner Philip Barlow said Ella's mother, Rosamund, had not been given information which could have led to her take steps which might have prevented her daughter's death.   On April 21, Mr Barlow said legally binding targets for particulate matter in line with World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines would reduce the number of deaths from air pollution in the UK and urged the Government to take action. The WHO guidelines suggest keeping an average concentration of PM2.5 under 10 micrograms per cubic metre of air (ug/m3), to prevent increased deaths. The UK limit, based on European Union (EU) recommendations, is a yearly average of 25 ug/m3. Ella's bereft mother, who spent more than five years campaigning for justice, said she would have moved home if she had known polluted air was killing her daughter.  She said: 'Because of a lack of information I did not take the steps to reduce Ella's exposure to air pollution that might have saved her life.  'I will always live with this regret.  'People are dying from air pollution each year. Action needs to be taken now or more people will simply continue to die.'",

The celebrity hair stylist, 63, whose clients have included Princess Diana, the Duchess of York (who performed the opening ceremony), Margaret Thatcher, Elizabeth Taylor and David Bowie, is shutting his Mayfair salon after 30 years. Speaking to Eamonn Holmes and Isabel Webster on GB News today, Nicky explained: 'The thing that the pandemic has changed, not just in terms of the clients coming in and not wanting to be in Mayfair, also I think, attitudes of the workers. 'You've got so many people really, that are wanting to do less days and, being paid the same amount of money, but I think mostly it was the fact that we set a standard that was at a very high level. 'We did something very, very new... and we weren't really able to continue at that level.' His chat with the television presenters comes after the Daily Mail yesterday revealed that he had told his devastated staff on Monday that the salon would be closing.  Nicky, who has cut and styled the hair of thousands of high profile clients over the years including Princess Diana, the Duchess of York and David Bowie, has also seen higher costs have a huge impact on his business. Speaking on Tuesday, Nicky announced the closure of the salon, explaining: 'This prestigious salon has been in Mayfair for over 30 years and has been a huge part of our lives, both personally and professionally. 'However, the last two years have been the toughest we have experienced, with Covid-enforced, long-term closures, rising rates and overheads making the salon no longer economically sustainable.' He added: 'This was not an easy decision to make, we have spent months exploring alternative solutions to keep the salon in business but unfortunately these have not come to fruition. 'All staff impacted will be paid fully and all our obligations to them fulfilled. We're incredibly grateful to the dedication and hard work of every single member of staff.' Nicky added in today's discussion on GB News: 'I've got hundreds and hundreds of wonderful messages from clients, but also from members of staff that just said that was just the best time of their lives.' The stylist, 63, who was raised in a London council flat, founded the business with long-term girlfriend, Lesley Clarke, 68, thanks to a PS20,000 loan, and the pair turned it into an empire which was said to be worth PS60 million. He later split from Lesley after confessing to having an affair with a Vivien Westwood model, but the pair remained close, with Lesley even accompanying Nicky when he received an OBE in 2008. Presenter Isabel quipped on today's GB News interview that Nicky must have heard hundreds of secrets from high profile clients over the years.  He replied: 'I used to say that I could write tomorrow's front page. Nicky continued: 'The reason I could say that was because I was entrusted with an awful lot of information.' And he revealed that the salon near the Connaught Hotel had a secret entrance so that clients could come to the salon without being seen by press photographers.  He said that while many of his clients have reputations for being divas, he never saw that side of them. Nicky added that he was starstruck by boyhood heroes including David Bowie and Bryan Ferry. The 63-year-old said: 'I could probably say that I probably did most of the older divas - Margaret Thatcher, Diana Ross's, Naomi Campbell, they were fabulous with me, they were just lovely. 'It's really when you're doing your boyhood heroes, you know - David Bowie and Bryan Ferry and all, and actually, it's just I'm a huge Bowie fan. I used to camp outside his house when I was 13.'",
  "37c089bc0e312aa3072413b89e9a52a1672c329f79a9dc95931b65ec": "Ted Lasso star Jason Sudeikis has sparked furious debate online after his ex-fiencee Olivia Wilde was served with custody papers while she was on-stage in front of 4,000 people giving a presentation about the movie that sparked her romance with current boyfriend Harry Styles.  The extraordinary incident sent shockwaves through Hollywood on Tuesday night, when images emerged of a flustered Wilde, 38, being presented with a 'personal and confidential' manila envelope while she was in the middle of a speech about her upcoming thriller Don't Worry Darling at this year's CinemaCon in Las Vegas.  Now, some social media users are railing against Ted Lasso star Sudeikis, 46, accusing the comedic actor of purposefully trying to embarrass his ex-fiancee, with whom he shares two children - eight-year-old son Otis and five-year-old daughter Daisy.  However, sources close to the actor have insisted that he was unaware Wilde would be served the papers in such a public and humiliating manner, with one insider telling DailyMail.com that Sudeikis had 'no prior knowledge' of when the documents would be handed to her - and insisting that the actor has been left appalled and upset over the incident.  The source added that the papers in question were not actually 'custody' documents but rather jurisdiction papers, which typically determine which court will hear and decide a child custody case.  Still, Twitter has erupted with speculation about the sensational moment, with some seizing the opportunity to compare Sudeikis with his beloved Apple TV+ character Ted Lasso, whom many noted would never have condoned such 'savage' behavior. 'So Ted Lasso is an A**Ho?' one person wrote on Twitter, while another chimed in: 'D**k move Ted Lasso.' 'There's no way Ted Lasso did that,' a third person added, as another insisted: 'Ted Lasso would never.' Some social media users accused the actor of wanting to ensure that his ex was served with the papers in as public a forum as possible, suggesting that it was his way of seeking revenge after she went public with her romance with Styles, 28, just a few months after her split from Sudeikis was made public.  'I had an ex served with papers before and there is absolutely NO WAY Jason Sudeikis didn't know where and when Olivia Wilde would be served... NO WAY! The when and where is something that is discussed before the papers are delivered,' one Twitter user wrote.  Speaking to DailyMail.com, one source close to Sudeikis insisted that the actor had no idea when or where the papers were going to be served to Wilde by the Los Angeles-based process server, who was hired by his Brooklyn-based law firm. The insider added that Sudeikis had no contact with the process server, whose employment was handled entirely by his attorneys.  'Papers were drawn up to establish jurisdiction relating to the children of Ms. Wilde and Mr. Sudeikis,' the source said. 'Mr. Sudeikis had no prior knowledge of the time or place that the envelope would have been delivered as this would solely be up to the process service company involved and he would never condone her being served in such an inappropriate manner.'  It had initially been reported that the documents were an unsolicited script sent by a fan in the hopes of receiving Wilde's attention - however that didn't stop furious speculation among attendees at the annual event about whether or not the envelope actually contained legal documentation, rumors that were eventually confirmed by Deadline. Wilde was mid-way through a presentation about her new movie - which she directed and in which her beau Styles, 28, stars - when she was briefly interrupted by an unidentified person who approached the stage from the front rows of the audience at the Vegas event and slid the manila envelope across the front of the stage toward her. 'This is for me?' Wilde asked, before opening the envelope and briefly reading the documents. She then continued with her presentation.  Wilde and Sudeikis began dating in November 2011 and got engaged in December 2012, before eventually splitting in November 2020. They share two children together - eight-year-old son Otis and five-year-old daughter Daisy. Details of their current custody arrangement remain private, and neither Olivia nor Jason have commented on the contents of the envelope.  However their silence has not stopped social media users from engaging in a bitter debate over who was in the right - with some claiming that Sudeikis 'deserved' to get revenge on Wilde after she went public with her romance with Styles, 28, so soon after the former couple split.  'Gotta tip my hat to Jason Sudeikis,' one person wrote. 'I would have done the same thing... People want only certain things to be public. I think everything should be fair game once you put yourself out there.' Another agreed, tweeting: 'Jason Sudeikis having Olivia Wilde served on stage while giving a presentation in Vegas is wild... honestly, she deserves it.'  CinemaCon said they are now reevaluating their security procedures, in light of the incident: 'We have never in the history of the convention had an incident where a delegate has approached the stage who was not authorized to be there,' Mitch Neuhauser Managing Director of CinemaCon said in a statement to Deadline. 'In light of this incident, we are reevaluating our security procedures to ensure the safety of all our attendees.'  The annual gathering of cinema owners and Hollywood studios at Las Vegas' Colosseum for CinemaCon requires attendees to purchase a badge.  Industry attendees and media must apply for accreditation well in advance of the April convention and upon arrival at the event present 'photo ID matching the name on the required documentation.' Reporter Chris Lee detailed her reaction on stage in a tweet, which read: 'Half way through her schpiel about Don't Worry Darling, Olivia Wilde was handed a manila envelope. Seemed like she got served a lawsuit!'  He said that the Booksmart director said: 'This is for me? Is this a script? Ok got it. Thank you.'  Lee added: 'I thought it was part of the presentation or a joke. But then...that was the end of it.'  Another audience member, Jim Vejvoda, tweeted: 'Was Olivia Wilde served with papers onstage at CinemaCon? 'Some woman walked up to the stage and left an envelope for her. Olivia opened it and then never addressed it and continued on with her presentation.  'We were expecting a bit but she never addressed the papers.'  CinemaCon said they are now reevaluating their security procedures, in light of the incident: 'We have never in the history of the convention had an incident where a delegate has approached the stage who was not authorized to be there,' Mitch Neuhauser Managing Director of CinemaCon said in a statement to Deadline. 'In light of this incident, we are reevaluating our security procedures to ensure the safety of all our attendees.' In order to get into Vegas' Colosseum for CinemaCon, non-industry attendees need to purchase a badge.  Deadline reported that the papers were delivered to Wilde by a process server who was hired by Sudeikis' Brooklyn-based attorneys to issue the legal documents.  The process of serving someone with papers must be conducted by a third party who is over the age of 18. This person can be a law officer, a friend or family member, or - as was the case with Wilde - a hired process server who is paid to deliver the legal documents in-person.  Rules for serving papers vary from state to state, however typically the law dictates that papers must be handed to a defendant directly.  Wilde's latest film Don't Worry Darling is being released by Warner Brothers this coming September and stars her much younger boyfriend Styles.  The duo formed a close bond while shooting the psychological thriller, which also features the likes of Florence Pugh and Gemma Chan, in 2020.  News of Wilde and Sudeikis's split came on November 13, 2020 with sources claiming at the time that it was 'amicable' and that their two children son Otis and daughter Daisy Josephine would remain a 'priority.'  An insider also said that the pair had actually separated at the start of the year, months before their split was made public.   A source close to the couple told PEOPLE: 'The split happened at the beginning of the year [2020]. It's been amicable and they've transitioned into a great co-parenting routine. The children are the priority and the heart of the family's relationship.'  Despite the initial reports of an amicable split, a source claimed to Entertainment Tonight in January 2021, that Jason had been 'really hurt' by her moving on with Harry.  A source said: '[Jason] has been really hurt and somewhat jealous that Olivia has moved on with Harry.' There have also been conflicting reports as to the timeline of Olivia's split from Jason and when she started her new relationship with Harry. The original PEOPLE report on their split claimed that Olivia and Jason broke up 'at the beginning' of 2020, but further sources claimed 'she and Jason were very much together as recently as this fall [2020].' A report from UsWeekly claimed: 'Olivia called off the engagement in early November [2020] but only after she already had gotten close to Harry.' Olivia cast Harry in her film in September 2020 after Shia LaBeouf was fired from the role. Rumours of Harry and Olivia's romance were confirmed when they were seen holding hands at his agent's wedding in Montecito, California, on January 3 2021, raising eyebrows over just how quickly she had moved on. May, 2011 -  Jason and Olivia meet at a Saturday Night Live wrap party in 2011, when both were recently single after ending their marriages Jason later recalled he didn't make 'any sort of moves' at the time  November, 2011 -  The pair start dating after months of friendship December 2012 - Jason proposes over the holidays 2014 - The couple welcome their first child, a son Otis 2016 - Their daughter Daisy is born with Wilde explaining how she believes becoming a parent with Jason is a stronger commitment for the couple than tying the knot October 2020 - Olivia starts shooting her second directional effort Don't Worry Darling, starring new cast member Harry Styles November 2020 - Jason and Olivia split  January 2021 -  Harry and Olivia's romance is confirmed when they are seen holding hands at his agent's wedding in Montecito, California, on January 3   There were conflicting reports on the exact timing of their split, with a source claiming to PEOPLE in a January 2021 report: 'Jason feels that the timeline that Olivia and Harry would like people to believe - that she and Jason split ages ago, long before she became involved with Harry - is simply not accurate.' The source added that the trouble began around the start of production on Wilde's sophomore directorial effort in the fall of 2020. 'She began filming [Don't Worry Darling] in September, and by October, he began to get the impression that she wanted out. By November, they'd announced their split.' The source emphasized 'that's how quickly it happened,' adding that 'none of it happened until she began filming with Harry.' In a December 2021 interview with American Vogue the actress referred to the timeline dispute, telling the magazine: 'It's obviously tempting to correct a false narrative. 'But I think what you realize is that when you're really happy, it doesn't matter what strangers think about you.' She added: 'All that matters to you is what's real, and what you love, and who you love.' Jason meanwhile confirmed in a 2021 interview with GQ that the couple split in November 2020, admitting that 'I'll have a better understanding of why in a year.' 'And an even better one in two, and an even greater one in five, and it'll go from being, you know, a book of my life to becoming a chapter to a paragraph to a line to a word to a doodle,' he continued. 'That's an experience that you either learn from or make excuses about. You take some responsibility for it, hold yourself accountable for what you do, but then also endeavor to learn something beyond the obvious from it.' Olivia scrambled to cast Harry to star in her second film after initially casting Shia LaBeouf in the lead role.  LaBeouf was fired from the project in September 2020 because she has a 'zero a**hole policy' and his behavior was 'off-putting,' according to Variety, with a source saying: 'He is not an easy guy to work with.' Shortly after he was replaced, Shia entered a rehab facility after his ex-girlfriend, musician FKA twigs, claimed he knowingly infected her with an STD and relentlessly abused her. Jason also moved on, embarking on a relationship with his Ted Lasso co-star, British glamour model Keeley Hazell, 35, last year.  Jason and Olivia met at a Saturday Night Live wrap party in May 2011, when both were recently single.  Nine months prior, Olivia ended her eight-year marriage to Italian-American filmmaker Tao Ruspoli and Jason had just divorced screenwriter Kay Cannon, whom he was married to from 2004 to 2010.  During a 2017 appearance on The Late Late Show With Stephen Colbert, the Horrible Bosses star spilled on his first interaction with Wilde. 'I actually came off looking a lot cooler than I really am because I had heard through the grapevine, through mutual friends that weren't exactly her best girlfriends, that would report back, 'Oh, you know, I think she's dating someone,' so I didn't make any sort of moves,' he recalled at the time.  'I was just very, very busy with other things.' The actress echoed the thoughts, explaining:  'I was just learning to be by myself; I'd been divorced nine months.  'We were both seeing people but were single. He seemed to really see me, see through the bull***t.' Wilde and Sudeikis announced their engagement in 2013 before the births of their two children. Speaking to Net-a-Porter's Porter Edit in February 2016, Wilde explained how she believed becoming a parent with her ex was a stronger commitment for the couple than tying the knot. 'We are seriously connected,' she said. 'Before you have a child, marriage is the ultimate commitment and promise to one another, and then once you have a child, it's like, 'Oh, we're committed and promised already.' Nearly a year and a half after they first met, Wilde and Styles are still going strong. The actress recently supported the popstar as he headlined the Coachella Valley Music Festival the past two weekends.  She was captured cheering him on in the crowd as he dominated the stage with a guitar in hand. Recent reports have suggested that Olivia and Harry are getting very serious after she introduced the pop star to her two children.  Insiders have claimed that despite it looking like a 'showbiz hook up' at first, it has become clear that the loved-up couple are much more than that. Harry, who has previously dated a slew of celebrity girlfriends, has allegedly never been so serious about anyone before, reports The Sun. A source said: 'This looked like quite a showbizzy thing at first, two glamorous people hooking up but now it's obviously a lot more than that. 'They held back a bit at first but now that things are more settled the time was right to do the next thing. 'It's really exciting for them - and for Harry it's the most serious he has ever really been about somebody.' It was reported that Harry is 'slowly' getting to know the children of his girlfriend Olivia almost a year into their relationship.  Olivia is currently living in the UK with the singer while estranged husband Jason films the third series of the comedy drama Ted Lasso. She has her two children in London while he is working on the Apple TV programme, set in the UK. 'Ironically, it is Jason's work that means they can be together,' said a source, adding that friends are expecting Harry and Olivia to marry.",
  "49738d74f93ac1f6b3aa2186ecacaf1840ec8cc92f9964859d6cf5c3": "A heroin addict and 'abject failure' of a mother has been jailed for 20 years after she put her drug habit before her little boy, using the severely asthmatic seven-year-old's inhaler to smoke crack and his bed to entertain her sex worker clients - before he died alone 'gasping for air' in the garden.  Laura Heath, 40, was jailed for 20 years today because of her 'catastrophic and deplorable' parenting that led to the death of neglected and abused Birmingham schoolboy Hakeem Hussain in November 2017 in yet another child cruelty scandal that shames British social services.  Tragic Hakeem begged his mother to stop doing drugs but she ignored him. His fragile and 'freezing' body was eventually discovered clutching a leaf outside a decrepit flat where he was staying with her and other addicts because the power and heating had been cut off in their own home. She also refused him a bed so she could use it for sex work, so he slept on the sofa. Heath had even used foil and an elastic band to rig one of her son's blue inhalers to smoke crack. The addict had a PS55-a-day habit and her son was found to have inhaled tobacco smoke in the hours before his death, having also been exposed to heroin, crack cocaine and cannabis through second-hand smoke. She was found guilty of the gross negligence manslaughter of her seven-year-old son at Coventry Crown Court a week ago and was sentenced to 20 years in prison today, although must only serve a minimum of 13 years and two months. Mr Justice Dove told Heath as she stood impassively in the dock today: 'You should have followed Hakeem's advice and stopped taking drugs. You didn't.'  He went on: 'You betrayed the trust of all children who have to place their trust in their parents to do the best for them and you catastrophically failed to act as a responsible mother. 'All of these offences were committed while you were under the influence or indeed in the thrall of drugs, in particular heroin and crack cocaine. Your addiction no doubt led to you prioritising your drug use over almost everything else in your life'.  Hakeem had died less than 48 hours after social workers failed to act on a school nurse's plea to immediately remove the boy from his mother's care before the weekend he died because his life was in danger. The council workers refused, saying they wanted to wait until Monday instead, by which time he was dead. Following the social services meeting his mother messaged a friend saying: 'Hakeem is on child protection... neglect... hey ho... gonna do what I gotta do.'  Hakeem, described as 'bubbly and full of life with brilliant communication skills' by his school where he had 'stolen the show' at the last nativity play before he died, had even begged his mother to give up drugs - but she put her addiction over her son's safety and wellbeing at every turn until it cost him his life.   On the night he died, police believe the seven-year-old had let himself out of the flat some time after 10.30pm because it had been dense with drugs smoke - but he then died gasping for air in the garden and his body, already stiff from rigor mortis, was found at 7.30am the following morning. His mother from hell was out cold inside because she had gone through three bags of crack.     2013 Hakeem develops asthma symptoms and goes on to be hospitalised three times. He also moves into the Long Acre property, described by one visitor as having 'disgusting' conditions. The witness told how Hakeem said he had no bed, sleeping instead on the sofa, while there was evidence Heath used an upstairs bedroom for sex work to fund her habit with a basket of condoms next to the mattress  2017 On November 24, a school nurse told a child protection conference that Hakeem 'could die at the weekend from asthma'. Nurse Melanie Richards, as well as a family outreach worker at Hakeem's Nechells Primary School who was also in the meeting, scored Hakeem's safety as 'zero' out of 10. The meeting ended with agreement the social worker would speak to Heath on Monday - by which time Hakeem had died. On November 26 Hakeem's freezing body is found outside the Cook Street flat just after 7.30am. On December 11, Dr Roger Malcomson, a consultant paediatric pathologist, conducted an autopsy on at Coventry Mortuary, finding that Hakeem's lungs were 'hyperexpanded.' He told the trial: 'Hakeem's lungs were so hyperexpanded that the lungs overlapped the heart which is not normal. The lungs were in a different position compared to that of a normal person.' 2018 In April, a new organisation, Birmingham Children's Trust, takes over child social services 2022 April 22: Heath is convicted of Hakeem's manslaughter at Coventry Crown Court. Hakeem had no bed, sleeping on the sofa, while there was evidence Heath used an upstairs bedroom for sex work to fund her habit because she kept a basket of condoms next to the mattress. Her son's school clothes were filthy, stank of urine and reeked of cigarettes, but despite the obvious signs of neglect, he wasn't taken into care. Months after his death, Birmingham's failing social services department was taken over poor performance dating back to 2008 when three other children on their radar where either beaten or starved to death by their parents. Today the judge told 40-year-old Heath, who was ordered to serve two-thirds of her 20-year sentence before becoming eligible for parole, that the death had occurred after her life 'entered a drug-fuelled downward spiral into squalor, chaos and tragedy'.  Mr Justice Dove said: 'When Hakeem Hussain died he was only seven-years-old. 'It is clear in his tragically short life Hakeem had been an inspiration of happiness and affection for people who knew him. 'He was described as bubbly and full of life with brilliant communication skills. 'All of that potential for a wonderful and fulfilling life was extinguished as he collapsed on his own clutching a leaf in the garden. 'We can only imagine the pain and fear that must have blighted the end of his young life. For anyone, let alone a child, this was a shockingly terrible way for him to die. 'How could it possibly be that this could happen? The truth is, in short, is that Hakeem died as a result of your deplorable negligence. 'He died as a result of your catastrophic and deplorable parenting. 'From the early spring of 2017 your parenting of Hakeem entered a drug-fuelled downward spiral into squalor, chaos and tragedy. 'It is clear to me from the evidence that this was a truly exceptional and reprehensible breach of duty. 'Your failure to manage Hakeem's asthma was persistent and continuous and caused him obvious distress in the day-by-day deterioration of his condition. 'This offence arises in the context of other serious criminality in the form of your abuse of heroin and cocaine and the charges of child cruelty. 'His medication regime was ignored and neglected and he was exposed at home to triggers in a dirty, smoky and cold environment. 'You fall to be sentenced in the category of very high culpability. There are aggravating features which need to be taken into account. 'The victim was a young child and moreover you were his mother. You were the person who first and foremost had a responsibility for his welfare. 'He was entitled to rely upon you as his adult caregiver, to take care of him and nurture him - especially protecting his health'. Friends also told the court how they witnessed Heath smoking class A drugs while Hakeem was feeling ill in the next room - just 24 hours before he died. The 999 call made by Heath after Hakeem was found was also played to the court during the trial. She said: 'He's dead... my son* he's took himself outside when we're asleep because he's got asthma* and he's fell asleep* he's dead. He's gone... he's blue and he's stiff. There's no saving him. He's gone. He's my baby... he's my baby.' Giving evidence Dr Peter Ehrhardt, a former doctor of safeguarding in East Lancashire, said he was left 'speechless' at the way Hakeem had been treated. The court was told Heath had smoked heroin and crack cocaine in the 48 hours before her son's death and he also had tobacco in his lungs. Dr Ehrhardt said: 'In my opinion she knew the previous night that Hakeem's asthma was not under control. 'Had she acted then in my opinion his deterioration would have been less severe and he would not have died.' Heath had told cops after her arrest that Hakeem would go outside for some fresh air if he was ever struggling with his breathing. She said in her police interview after his death: 'I had a funny feeling he had gone out in the night and fell asleep outside.' After the case Hakeem's head teacher, David Crumps said: 'The news of Hakeem's death shocked our community five years ago - he was a friendly, polite little boy who will forever be remembered for his gentle nature. 'His friends will remember him with love and great fondness and he is greatly missed.' An additional statement on behalf of the children and staff at Nechells E-Act Academy said: 'Hakeem was a most beautiful little boy, a great friend to many staff and children with a wicked sense of humour and an infectious giggle. 'He was a warm and generous-hearted soul who was talented across many areas of the curriculum but especially so in music and the arts. 'He totally stole the show with his performance as the 'Christmas Star' in the year two nativity play with his clear speaking voice and stage presence. 'There wasn't a dry eye in the house as he delivered his lines with poignancy, grace and humour. 'The twinkle in his beautiful eyes was as bright as the stars in the sky, and our love for him will shine out forever, from all of his Nechells family.' Hakeem's death came just months before Birmingham Children's Trust took over child social services in early 2018. Responsibility was transferred from the council's failing child social services department after years of poor performance dating back to 2008.  Those failures were placed in sharp focus by high-profile child deaths, such as those of Khyra Ishaq in 2008, Keanu Williams in 2011, and Keegan Downer in 2015.  2008: Khyra Ishaq Seven-year-old Khyra Ishaq was starved to death by her mother and stepfather after social workers missed opportunities because they were said to be more interested in their careers. Khyra had been monitored and visited by at least nine social workers, education officers, teachers and police, but information was not acted upon and procedures were not followed. She died of an infection in May 2008 following a 'chilling' punishment regime at her home in Handsworth, Birmingham. Three social workers were disciplined after a report highlighted how some officials were more focused on 'the rights of the adults' and the 'potential impact' on their careers. 2011: Keanu Williams  Two-year-old Keanu Williams had been seen by health workers at least 12 times with signs of abuse such as head injuries and cuts. But children's services believed his mother Rebecca Shuttleworth when she said they were just bumps and bruises. In reality, Shuttleworth, 25, had beaten her son and his body was found in January 2011 with 37 injuries including bite marks, a fractured skull and a tear in his stomach. A report revealed Shuttleworth, jailed in June 2013, had been 'surprised' he wasn't taken away from her at birth. It said 'staff were distracted by his mother's needs rather than the child's'. At least three untrained workers - including a student on a work placement - were also put in charge of vital reviews. 2015: Keegan Downer Kandyce Downer was jailed for life for the murder of 18-month-old Keegan Downer, who died at the family home in Birmingham on 5 September 2015. Keegan had been repeatedly beaten and suffered more than 200 injuries. She had 153 scars on her body, including her face and neck. Downer had been appointed Keegan's guardian with the blessing of social services and six months after Keegan was put in Downer's care, the systematic abuse began. It was claimed Downer only wanted Keegan to rake in PS125-a-week maintenance payments. She also secured a four-figure lump sum towards the cost of a new car for taking on the child, on top of her housing benefit and child support. ... and elsewhere: How social services missed multiple opportunities to save horrifically abused children Logan Mwangi, murdered July 2021  Logan Mwangi never stood a chance as he was kept prisoner and tortured in his home, with social workers missing crucial opportunities to save the little boy before he was murdered by his mother, stepfather and a 14-year-old boy. John Cole, 40, and Angharad Williamson, 31, of Sarn, Bridgend, and a teenage boy, who cannot be named because of his age, were convicted of murdering Logan at Cardiff Crown Court on April 21. On the morning of July 31 2021, the once 'smiling, cheerful little boy', was found by police just 250 metres from his home submerged in the River Ogmore, wearing a pair of dinosaur pyjama bottoms and a Spider-Man top. In the months and weeks leading up to his death, Logan had been 'dehumanised' by his family. His stammer worsened, becoming particularly bad around Cole, and he wet himself more frequently and began self-harming. But in yet another astonishing failing by social services, workers missed at least two opportunities to rescue the schoolboy from the clutches of his parents, who 'kept him prisoner' in his dark bedroom - likened to a 'dungeon' - with a baby gate barring him from leaving after testing positive for coronavirus on July 20.    Star Hobson, murdered September 22, 2020 Star Hobson was only 16 months old when she was killed at her home in Keighley, West Yorkshire.  Star was murdered by her mother Frankie Smith's girlfriend Savannah Brockhill after suffering months of abuse in her home during the Covid lockdown last year. Frankie Smith 20, was handed an eight-year sentence for allowing her daughter's death. This was extended to 12 years in March for being too lenient.  Brockhill, 28, was convicted of murder and jailed for life with a minimum term of 25 years. No appeal was made against her sentence.  It was revealed that social services had missed five opportunities to stop her killers in the months before her death on September 22, 2020.    Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, murdered June 16, 2020  Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, aged six, was murdered by his cruel stepmother Emma Tustin in June. She was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 29 years and the boy's father Thomas Hughes was jailed for 21 years for manslaughter.  The boy had been seen by social workers just two months before his death, but they concluded there were no safeguarding concerns.  In October 2019, Aileen Carabine, a special educational coordinator at Arthur's school, said Arthur 'deteriorated' that month.  Kyrell Matthews, murdered October 20, 2019 Kyrell Matthews, aged two, was left with 41 rib fractures and internal injuries by the time of his death after weeks of cruelty at the hands of his mother Phylesia Shirley and her boyfriend Kemar Brown. Brown was convicted of murder while Shirley was acquitted of murder but found guilty of the alternative charge of manslaughter. They appeared alongside each other in the dock as Brown was sentenced to at least 25 years in prison while Shirley was jailed for 13 years. The toddler, who was non-verbal, could be heard crying and screaming on distressing audio files taken from Shirley's phone and played to jurors during the trial.  Brown and Shirley are understood to have been visited by social services at least once. A jury of 10 women and two men found Heath guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence a day after the mother and stepfather of five-year-old Logan Mwangi were convicted of his murder alongside a 14-year-old youth in South Wales. In that case, jurors were told social services missed at least four chances to intervene, while the teenage defendant's foster carers told how their warnings that the boy had a fascination with killing had fallen on deaf ears. Hakeem was found dead in a garden early on a Sunday morning in November 2017, after seeking fresh air to ease his breathing - and having been unable to wake mother Laura Heath from her drug-induced slumber. In a prophetic intervention, just two days earlier nurse Melanie Richards told a child protection conference arranged to discuss Hakeem's plight that he 'could die at the weekend'. The school's family outreach lead backed the nurse's position but although the serious risk to Hakeem was recognised, he was not removed and instead was made subject to a Child Protection Plan - with social workers planning to step up intervention efforts on the Monday. Jurors in Coventry heard that when Heath was telephoned with the outcome of that child protection meeting, which she declined to attend, she blithely texted a friend: 'Hakeem is on child protection... neglect... hey ho.' Heath's guilty verdict came just four months after the same courtroom heard how the stepmother and father of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes were able to torture and kill the six-year-old after fooling social workers. In the latest case to shame children's services in England:  The three week trial heard how Hakeem had been identified as a child in need six months before his death, in the middle of a three-and-a-half month period where he was recorded absent from school 59 times without authorisation. At one point in the months running up to his death, the helpless child was heard commenting that his jumper 'smells of Charlie' - a street name for cocaine. The court heard Heath had repeatedly ignored medical instruction to help Hakeem manage his asthma, failing to ensure he used his preventative inhaler each day. Expert witness Dr Peter Ehrardt, a retired consultant paediatrician, told the court there was no evidence that Hakeem's asthma was uncontrollable, and said he would not have died if looked after properly. The court heard Hakeem was hospitalised five times - three of those as an emergency patient - as his condition deteriorated. Little more than 24 hours before he died, Heath, invited a friend to the flat they were staying at in Nechells, Birmingham, to 'get smashed'. She had moved out of her own rented flat because the gas had been disconnected due to non-payment. But the friend was so horrified by the condition of the rubbish-filled address she offered to take Hakeem back to her own address. Heath refused. Police photographed drug paraphernalia and an overflowing ashtray amongst rubbish and half-eaten food on the living room table following Hakeem's death early the following morning. When officers went to Heath's own flat, they found rubbish piled up in a bedroom beside a sheetless mattress and a table littered with condoms, where Heath prostituted herself to earn drug cash. Although the court heard Heath had a PS55-a-day habit, the mother of four children by four men had once been earmarked as a university candidate by her form teacher at Byng Kendrick Central secondary school in Tile Cross, Birmingham. A relative said she appeared to fall off the rails after her mother Valerie Drew separated from her alcoholic stepfather, who has since died. Heath got a job at a local taxi office where she 'began to attract the attention of men' and by 15 she was a school truant and pregnant with her first child. The source said the father was a man three decades Heath's senior, but police were never contacted about the relationship. The pregnancy set a marker for a chaotic journey into an adulthood mired in prostitution and addictions to heroin and crack cocaine. By the time her eldest was six, he and his four-year-old sister were taken off Heath to be raised by their grandmother. The source said Heath's own father, a labourer, harboured a drug addiction of his own and had little to do with his daughter after leaving her mother when Heath was small. Heath's third child, a son aged 15, was placed with his Kurdish father after his birth, but Heath was adamant that she would retain custody of Hakeem, who's Muslim father had been jailed for a for a particularly nasty sexual assault by the time she gave birth. Following his release from prison, the couple were placed in a residential unit with Hakeem, where their parenting skills were monitored. 'Social services decided that they had done enough to keep Hakeem', Mrs Drew said. 'That was another mistake.' By then, Heath was telling friends she had converted to Islam, although she never wore a headscarf or attended the mosque. Mrs Drew, 67, said she was 'incredibly angry' with social services and Hakeem's school for 'failing' the boy. The lollipop lady, also of Nechells, Birmingham, said: 'Social services knew me because they'd been involved for years when I began guardian for Laura's older children. 'The school had my number. They knew where I lived - I'd had to pick Hakeem up in the past when Laura failed to collect him. Why didn't any of them come and tell me there were concerns? 'Hakeem was such a lovely little boy. We all feel as a family that we let him down, but social services and the school let him down the most. 'I had no idea he was missing so much school time.' Jurors heard Heath smoked heroin after putting Hakeem to bed for the final time. Mr Brook told the jury that Heath's 'use of asthma equipment to smoke drugs is a metaphor for her neglect of her child, symbolising her prioritisation of her own needs over his safety.' A neighbour heard tapping at his window in the early hours, but saw nothing in the darkness, the trial heard.  Hakeem's body was found just after 7.30am later that morning by the 51-year-old council tenant Heath had befriended, Tim Busk.  He would later be diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease and passed away three months ago. But relatives told how they discovered his computer and other possessions had vanished in the days following Hakeem's death. Sister-in-law Carol Busk, 60, told the Mail: 'We had no idea Heath and her son were basically living there. 'Tim was already showing symptoms (of Alzheimer's) by then and could just about make himself a cup of tea or beans on toast. 'Heath took Tim's money and his possessions to pay for her drugs. She was exploiting him and his illness for her own benefit.' Heath had earlier pleaded guilty to four counts of child cruelty relating to neglect by failing to provide proper medical supervision, and ill-treatment by exposing Hakeem to drugs. She will be sentenced on all five counts next week. Andy Couldrick, chief executive of Birmingham Children's Trust, said: 'There were some clear missed opportunities, (and) some of them are distressingly familiar in terms of other cases.' He said social workers 'didn't understand the amount of disguise and deception' Heath used to cover her addiction and said agencies failed to seek enough information from each other. He added: 'At the sharpest point was the child protection conference on Friday before the weekend of his death. 'That conference should have happened earlier...it should have led to more immediate action.'  A serious case review examining the circumstances of Hakeem's death is due to be published later this year. Heath left her son to die alone in a freezing garden in Birmingham after he got out of bed to get some fresh air. Jurors were told how she would 'source heroin and crack cocaine' as her 'first priority in life' ahead of the welfare of her young son. Shocking images released by police showed how Heath had used Hakeem's inhalers to smoke class A drugs from despite his breathing getting worse 'day by day.' Hakeem, who was suffering from uncontrolled asthma, was found in the garden at the at around 7.30am on November 26, 2017 but could not be saved by medics. During the month-long trial, the court had heard how Hakeem's death could have been completely avoided. He was also made to sleep on a sofa in squalid conditions, while his jumper smelled of urine and his school uniform reeked of cigarettes. Prosecutor Jonas Hankin QC said: 'Hakeem found himself powerless in a perfect storm where he had not been given his preventer medication. His lungs were in a poor condition and he was being put into adverse environments - cold, smoky and dirty environments.  'What chance did Hakeem have with his mother and her priorities? His death was avoidable. His death was a needless, premature death. Had it not been for her conduct Hakeem would still be alive. There can't be a greater breach of parental duty than that.' Hakeem was known to social services and was classed as 'vulnerable' due to concerns about 'neglect, attendance issues and his home life'. A child protection meeting was held two days before his death where a school nurse had warned Hakeem was at risk of dying and should be removed from his mum. But it was decided he should not be removed from his Heath's care despite his being as a 'serious risk of harm.' Following the meeting Heath messaged a friend saying: 'Hakeem is on child protection... neglect... hey ho... gonna do what I gotta do.' Prosecutors said Heath mismanaged Hakeem's asthma as she disengaged with social workers and school staff during 2017.  She was accused of prioritising her spiralling drug habit over her son's health, even resorting to sex work to fund it, the court heard. The jury were told the gas and electric were turned off at her 'chaotic' and 'messy' home in Long Acre, Nechells, resulting in her going to stay at an address in nearby Cook Street where Hakeem died. Heath had told police after her arrest that Hakeem would go outside for some fresh air if he was ever struggling with his breathing. She said in her police interview after his death: 'I had a funny feeling he had gone out in the night and fell asleep outside.' Dr Roger Malcomson a consultant paediatric pathologist who conducted an autopsy on Hakeem in December 11, 2017 at Coventry Mortuary, found that Hakeem's lungs were 'hyperexpanded.' He told the court during trial: 'Hakeem's lungs were so hyperexpanded that the lungs overlapped the heart which is not normal. 'The lungs were in a different position compared to that of a normal person.'",
  "00215038f1c9f2bf9924d486bb502bd32ae0e6305e588ae9636ef85d": "Police searching for missing Burnley mother-of-two Katie Kenyon today set up tents at a new patch of woods after receiving a tip-off about the van she was last seen in six days ago - as her ex-boyfriend entered no plea as he appeared in court today charged with her murder. Ms Kenyon, 33, was last seen at around 9.30am on Friday when it is thought she travelled in a van which left Burnley towards the Bolton-by-Bowland area of north Lancashire. At lunchtime today, two blue forensic tents were put up in a spot in Gisburn Forest, Lancs, as the search continued. Typically the structures can be used to protect forensic evidence, but may also be staked out to provide cover for equipment. In the afternoon, police revealed that a member of the public had reported a sighting of the van Ms Kenyon is thought to have travelled in. Police are now prioritising an area in the Forest of Bowland as they continue to search for the missing mother-of-two. Andrew Burfield, 50, was charged on Wednesday with her murder and was before Blackburn Magistrates' Court at 10am. He entered no plea and will appear at Preston Crown Court tomorrow. The family of care worker Ms Kenyon, from Padiham, have thanked well wishers for their support but have asked that people respect their privacy. More than 60 specialist search officers from four police forces have been scouring an area of dense forest land in Lancashire looking for Ms Kenyon. The hunt involved police and fire service officers, dog teams, mounted police, mountain rescue volunteers and drones. Police have today confirmed that the search, which was provisionally scheduled to go on until at least Friday, is still continuing.    Scores of officers were yesterday seen scouring the 3,000-acre Gisburn Forest in the Ribble Valley, some 23 miles from Todmorden Road, in Ms Kenyon's home town of Burnley, where she was last seen parking her white Ford Fiesta at 9.15am on Friday. Detective Superintendent Gary Brooks, Lancashire Police's Head of Major Crime, had said on Tuesday: 'We are continuing to search a number of different locations in connection with this investigation, including at Gisburn Forest and I am grateful to colleagues from Merseyside and North Wales, and other emergency service partners who are offering assistance in the these complex and wide-scale searches. 'I am aware that many members of the public have offered to help us in those searches and while I am grateful for that I would dissuade anyone from doing so.  'The area we are searching is very large and remote with no phone signal.  'The police teams are trained professionals who are used to doing this sort of work and I would hate for someone to get lost or come to harm while trying to help. Please leave it to us.' Forces from across the north west had been drafted in to help the search, which is expected to last until at least Friday. Police on horseback were on patrol across the many footpaths that weave through the woods. ",
  "5f6e6fcd8d9ecdd4297143132e00651d0aa96cc80d9d4449cb13b070": "Two M25 petrol stations has finally reopened seven hours after eco zealots targeted them in the latest protests from Just Stop Oil.  A total of 35 people have been arrested following the action that included activists gluing themselves to the pumps, to forecourt signs and to vehicles on Cobham Services in Surrey and Clacket Lane Services in Tatsfield. 'John Lennon lookalike' Louis McKechnie who has already been jailed over climate protests was able to lead a mob that blocked two M25 petrol stations for five hours during rush hour before smashing up the pumps.  He spent a month and a half in prison for blocking the motorway last year, but today ignored the threat of more jail time to vandalise petrol pumps using a mallet and an aerosol can.  The graduate has a sprawling criminal history, and was earlier this month banned from attending football games after invading the pitch during an Everton vs Newcastle match and using a cable tie to bind his neck to a goalpost.  Today, the 22-year-old crowed at having successfully 'disabled' the pumps at Cobham Services in Surrey.  He was part of a rag tag mob of 40 Just Stop Oil activists who descended on Cobham Services and the Clacket Lane Services in Kent at around 7am, before sitting outside the entrances and gluing themselves to the tarmac.  It took until 2pm when Surrey Police announced 40 officers had cleared the demonstrators from the forecourts - but again face questions about why they did not act faster to remove the group, who have vowed to continue causing hell to drivers at further stunts in the coming weeks. The force said it has to use specialist de-bonding equipment to remove the protesters.  But motorists have not been saved from disruption with a total of 35 pumps damaged at Cobham Services, and a further 20 pumps damaged at Clacket Lane. Another activist, 22-year-old Coventry student Nathan McGovern, has also been regularly arrested carrying out illegal stunts and was today filmed smashing petrol pumps.  He spoke in a grandiose video address uploaded to the Just Stop Oil twitter account this morning, where he accused the government of 'genocide' for not doing enough to tackle global warming.  Stephanie Golder, a 34-year-old charity project coordinator from Essex, claimed to be 'sick and tired of being treated like a criminal' - as her accomplices destroyed a petrol pump in an blatant act of criminal damage.  Motorists hit back by blasting the 'clueless' demonstrators and demanded ministers 'please get on top of this issue' to prevent further disruption to the public.   Just Stop Oil claim 1,000 activists have been arrested since the start of the month, when they blocked a series of oil terminals in a move that was partially blamed for pushing up petrol prices.  Surrey Police said the stunts had caused 'considerable disruption' and 'huge financial loss' with the pumps switched off and motorists being diverted away from both stations. It came as another group of Just Stop Oil protest held a third day of protests outside the Kingsbury Oil Terminal in a potential breach of an injunction banning demonstrations at the site.  Eight activists were arrested and face a potential charge of contempt of court. Ten other protesters arrested outside Kingsbury yesterday will appear at Birmingham Magistrates' Court today.  The maximum penalty is a prison sentence of two years or an unlimited fine.  Superintendent Graham Barnett said: 'Police responded after reports that pumps were being smashed up and that protesters were gluing themselves to pumps, vehicles and forecourt signs. 'We appreciate that this caused considerable disruption to motorists attempting to use the services and to the petrol stations themselves, who will also have suffered a huge financial loss as a result of this activity. 'All protesters have now been removed and 35 people are in custody. Both forecourts have reopened but unfortunately a large number of pumps have been damaged which means they have not currently in use. However, the HGV pumps were not targeted and are still open for lorry drivers. 'We do appreciate that this incident has taken some time to resolve but given the circumstances, we were required to use officers trained in using specialist de-bonding equipment to safely remove the protesters, and this is a lengthy and complex process. 'Officers are also required to act within the law and are accountable for the decisions they make and the tactics they use. 'While we are required to facilitate peaceful protest, we will always take action against those who break the law and significantly impact on the lives and livelihoods of others, and clearly if officers are caught up dealing with protest activity, they aren't elsewhere preventing crime and responding as quickly to reports from the public.' Nathan McGovern, 22, a student from Coventry taking part in the demonstration, said: 'The world's most vulnerable are dying from a fossil-fuelled nightmare right now, whilst our government proposes to drill for more oil and gas. 'I refuse to stand by and watch as heatwaves and drought murder people across the global South and families in the UK are forced to choose between eating and heating.  'If politicians and bureaucrats refuse to act then it falls on ordinary people to do what they will not.'  In a video uploaded to the @JustStop_Oil Twitter account, he says: 'I'm Nathan, I'm 22 years old, and just now this morning myself and others have blocked the entrance to the forecourt of this petrol station and disabled the petrol station. 'None of us want to be here, none of us want to be doing this, none of us want to be disrupting the lives of the public but the criminal inaction on the climate crisis from our government has forced us into this.' He adds: 'This is madness, it is utterly genocidal.'  In a survey of 5195 Drivers online by FairFuelUK - a campaign group advocating for better petrol and diesel prices - 94% want petrol and diesel supplies to have legal protection in law, with interuption by protesters to get long sentences.  And 89% want the police to get tougher on the Stop Oil Protesters, 61% want longer custodial sentences, 81% want protesters' assets to be confiscated and 86% want minimum fines of PS10,000 each Howard Cox, founder of FairFuelUK said: 'Time this less than remotely resembling anything like a Conservative Government put the clueless self-obsessed amoebic Stop Oil protesters in jail. 'Millions are repulsed by these middle-class, privileged and well-off good-for-nothings ruining decent hard working people's lives.  'People are being savaged in the Ukraine and we are on the verge of a world war but this bunch of lunatics are hell bent on following an ill-informed myopic ideal that will not make a shed load of difference to the planet's environmental future.  Our police must be given stronger powers, by the Home Secretary, to protect the fuel supply chain and the law abiding mass majority needing to earn a living just to survive this' devastating cost of living crisis.' Protester Stephanie Golder said: 'I'm sick and tired of being treated like a criminal for standing up for what is right.  'The real criminals are those refusing to act on the climate emergency, it's truly genocidal for our government to give new licences for oil exploration. 'The poorest in this country need help with their energy bills now. But instead the government's energy strategy fails to mention energy saving measures such as insulation and instead prioritises a ''plan'' which puts us on a fast-track for climate chaos.' 'The supporters of Just Stop Oil will continue the disruption until the government makes a statement that it will end new oil and gas projects in the UK,' the group said. 'The Just Stop Oil Coalition is calling on all of those whose futures are being destroyed, who are facing poverty now, and who are outraged at yet another betrayal by this continuing dependence on oil and gas, to step up and take action.'  Just Stop Oil described the sabotage of petrol pumps as 'a significant escalation'.  Surrey Police said earlier today: 'Further arrests are likely to be made throughout the day as officers with specialist removal equipment are working to ensure that all protesters are removed safely, after a number of them glued themselves to pumps and signs on the petrol station forecourts. One of them has also glued himself to the top of a lorry. 'Officers were called to Clacket Lane Services around 7.02am following reports that a group of protesters had turned up.  'A further call was received around 7.06am that protesters were on site at Cobham Services petrol station and were damaging the pumps. 'The pumps have all been switched off and motorists were diverted away from both service stations.  'We appreciate the considerable disruption this is causing and we are working as quickly as we can to remove the protesters safely from the site and allow both petrol stations to re-open.  'Please bear with us while we continue to deal with these ongoing incidents.'  The move is reminiscent of Insulate Britain's protests between September and November last year, when M25 junctions were repeatedly blocked. Just Stop Oil began its protests on April 1. It has carried out a series of blockades of fuel terminals in south-east England and the Midlands, and targeted several high-profile football matches. More than 1,000 arrests have been made. The group said it will 'continue the disruption until the Government makes a statement that it will end new oil and gas projects in the UK'. Ten supporters arrested outside Kingsbury oil terminal on Wednesday are due to appear at Birmingham Magistrates' Court on Thursday. They are charged with contempt of court relating to an injunction granted to North Warwickshire Borough Council which prohibited protests at the site. By Martin Robinson for MailOnline  The green zealots trying to make Britain run out of fuel are a bunch of privileged students and professional protesters, MailOnline revealed earlier this month. Activists from Just Stop Oil have been hampering access to petrol and diesel, demanding that the Government stops new fossil fuel projects by digging tunnels below refineries, vandalising tankers or storming the terminals to climb on to the pipes. Essex Police has arrested hundreds of protesters since the disruption started on April 1 - while queues have formed at petrol stations across the country and some have even shut down due to a shortage of fuel.  One of the ringleaders is 'John Lennon lookalike' Louis McKechnie, a Bournemouth University graduate last seen 'surfing' on an oil truck in Essex on Friday. He became a poster boy for JSO after he tied himself to a goalpost to disrupt a Premier League at Everton last month.  Around 12 students were within the pipes at Grays Inter Terminal two weeks ago, including former boarding school choir girl and now Cambridge University student Cressie Gethin. With her in the rafters is student Nathan McGovern, another golden boy of the movement. Also manning the barricades were Brighton-based activist Hannah Hunt, 23, another student with a taste for expensive hobbies and travel, and Eben Lazarus, who describes himself as a 'musician and activist'.  And in the tunnels below the BP Kingsbury Oil Terminal in Warwickshire were retired vicar Tim Hewes, a veteran of the Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain movement who also sewed his lips together in protest against Rupert Murdoch.  Other members of the Just Stop Oil group, which is closely linked to the Extinction Rebellion, Animal Rebellion and Insulate Britain groups, is a rollerskating watchmaker and JSO's official 'de-escalator', XR's 'arts co-ordinator' and a Welsh organic farmer whose family business failed and he blamed climate change. These are the protesters at the heart of the current chaos that is leaving millions of Britons short on fuel: The Lennon-lookalike posterboy: Louis McKechnie  Louis McKechnie, 21, an engineering student, was charged with pitch encroachment and aggravated trespass after the incident at Goodison Park during the game between Everton and Newcastle United. He stormed the pitch halfway through the match and zip-tied himself to the goalpost wearing a bright orange t-shirt saying: 'Just stop oil.' Louis said he has received 'hundreds' of death threats since running on to the pitch.   McKechnie is a Bournemouth University student whose activism began with Extinction Rebellion (XR) in 2020 before he joined vegan group Animal Rebellion. The 21-year-old, whose experience of work appears to be only stints with a local fish-and-chip shop and supermarket, was one of the 'Highway Nine' Insulate Britain protesters jailed for blocking the M25 last year.  After serving half of a three-month prison sentence, he warned: 'What comes next will make Insulate Britain look like child's play.'  Rebel reverend: Tim Hewes Reverend Hewes, who once sewed up his lips in protest at the influence of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, was also repeatedly part of the mob blocking the M25 despite already being arrested numerous times. The activist has 'permission to officiate' in the Diocese of Oxford although he does not have a parish, and was earlier this month in tunnels under an oil tanker route. Asked about Rev Hewes last year, a spokesman for the diocese said: 'The actions of Rev Hewes and others, while arguably well-intentioned, have frustrated many people and we're unclear how the actions have been productive in encouraging the urgent change required.' Rev Hewes, a retired dentist, previously said the Bishop of Dorchester, Gavin Collins, who comes under the Diocese of Oxford, had told him 'he does support issues regarding climate change and the environment but not about breaking the law'. He was two weeks ago in a tunnel under a key tanker route to the BP Kingsbury Terminal in Warwickshire.  He said: 'I'm here because our government is useless, they make a lot of noise but they are doing nothing. 'As a priest I have a duty of care for people, and also for creation. What I'm doing here, with everyone in this caravan, is what our government should be doing - that is trying to protect our families and our loved ones from the appalling future that stands before us. 'I hope we can continue what we're doing and stop the flow of oil, if the government won't.' The jetsetting yachtswoman: Hannah Hunt The JSO protester is from Brighton, a common home town for Green zealots. Miss Hunt is a former XR supporter who broke into an ExxonMobil Oil refinery in Hampshire. She also posed with Mr McKechnie outside Downing Street with a letter for Boris Johnson. She also glued herself to the red carpet at the Bafta awards and admits to experiencing severe anxiety before a protest. But describing her state after starting she said she enjoys 'a weird, dreamy, calm mindset' she finds empowering. The Brighton-based activist studied at Sussex University, where she joined the sailing team. Her Instagram shows her holidaying in locations including Australia, Greece, Gran Canaria and Bali. She was last month in the rafters of the Grays refinery, with Eben Lazarus, a musician and activist also from Brighton. Sharing a video she said they were 'cold and uncomfortable' 17 hours into their protest, but added: 'But that suffering is minute compared to those in the frontline of the climate crisis'. Eben then encourages people to 'step up' and join protests because 'nobody can be a bystander if we want any chance of a future'.   XR's 'arts-co-ordinator': Indigo Rumbelow   Eco-fanatic Indigo Rumbelow, 27, from Gower, South-West Wales, has been arrested at least five times. In a Zoom call watched by The Mail on Sunday, she told activists: 'We want to create sustained disruption for two weeks.'    Describing her motivations, Miss Rumbelow said: 'My generation is being forced into action because our Government is destroying our future. We will immediately end all actions when it makes a statement that it will stop all new oil and gas.'  Indigo was first arrested at Cannes Lions Advertising Festival in 2019 for gate-crashing a Facebook conference and has been held by police on at least six occasions since then. In 2020 she began digging up the lawn in front of the Ministry for Housing Communities and Local Government and was arrested again in Parliament Square later that year when she blocked the road.  Justifying her behaviour recently she said: 'The only thing to do in a system that is driving itself to extinction is to rebel. If we look at the history books, we can see that the only way of creating the nonlinear change we need is for people to commit civil disobedience and force that change. 'Currently too few people are taking the necessary action. I urge anyone reading this article to realise that they too can rebel. In order to prevent ecosystem and societal collapse, at this pivotal moment in history, ordinary people need to take extra-ordinary action'. The rollerskating watchmaker: Amy Rugg-Easey Miss Rugg-Easey was involved in shutting down Tower Bridge on April 8. She and an unnamed man threw themselves off the bridge using abseil ropes and tiers a giant 'End fossil fuels now' banner.   The Labour-voting voting watchmaker and rollerskater from Newcastle upon Tyne describes herself as a 'rebel for life'. Describing her descent into eco-activism she said: 'I quit my career in watchmaking to study environmental science after listening to science podcasts while working at my bench. I remember thinking at the time 'it can't be that bad'. Climate change was something that you heard about every now again in the news as if it was the weather. When I really started to look at the facts, I started to panic. I felt a need to do something about it. When I began my degree, I had already been to a few Extinction Rebellion meetings and their famous 'heading for extinction' talk. 'It can't be that bad' I thought. I'd hoped that when I started studying, the things I would learn would show that that talk had been a huge exaggeration. Unfortunately, that was not the case'.  Describing the abseiling stunt she said: 'I was terrified stepping off that bridge. I decided to put my name out and wear my signature blue jacket hoping that people I've met would recognise me and realise that climate activists are just normal people too. I also know that it creates a target on my back. Certain people will wish that I'd died on that bridge today. I know that it makes my mum worry. 'I'm hoping my actions inspires others to be brave and take their first steps in fighting for our future. Not everyone has to hang off a bridge and get arrested, but everyone has to take meaningful action for things to change'. The Cambridge music student: Cressie Gethin  Miss Gethin, a former student of the prestigious Hereford Cathedral School, was among the group holding up the Grays refinery. She appears to be one of the five main founders of Just Stop Oil.  Cressie, a music student from Murray Edwards at Cambridge University, has been campaigning on climate issues at her college.  She told The Tab: 'I was very very surprised that Murray Edwards came out bottom of the league tables for their climate policies because I had imagined it was something they would have cared about and been active on'. The talented chorister has performed with her brother, also a singer.   The LBC mic gluer: Nathan McGovern The Coventry activist has flirted with XR and Animal Rebellion and disrupted a game at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.  He spoke to Tom Swarbrick in LBC's Westminster studio when he glued his hand to the microphone at around 11.40am. Mr McGovern said that the station was 'not using' its 'massive platform' to inform listeners of the dangers of the climate crisis Speaking live, Mr McGovern said to Mr Swarbrick: 'You have a massive platform, a microphone that you can use to tell people about the situation we're in and you're not using it. 'An ordinary person like me is having to take the microphone and tell your viewers the situation we are in.' The LBC presenter said: 'For those of you listening wondering what the banging on the microphone is, Mr McGovern seems to have, you've glued yourself to the microphone? That's fantastic.' After the incident, LBC presenter and Daily Mail columnist Andrew Pierce took over the live programme from Global's Leicester Square, before handing back to Mr Swarbrick when arrived there. During this time, Mc McGovern was left in the studio in the dark while waiting for police to arrive. He appeared as a spokesperson for Animal Rebellion advocating a 'plant-based food system' on Nigel Farage's GB News show in October 2021. After the disruption, the group tweeted: 'Every new oil and gas facility tightens the noose around the necks of our young people. If the media will not communicate their predicament they will have no choice but to take the microphone.' Just Stop Oil's 'de-escalator': Pavel Ivanov Mr Ivanov is reported to diffuse rows that break out at the protests when JSO's members shut down roads, for example. A Guardian report described the  'astonishing' abuse they suffer, in a tacit admission that they are struggling to win over many of their critics. In one incident linked to the blockading of oil refineries, one driver who had protesters on his roof said: 'If the police weren't here, I'd come up and f**king throw you off myself.' Another activist with a ladder was told: 'You put that up there, mate, and I'm going to ram it down your f**king throat'. Mr Ivanov claims n one occasion someone got him by the throat as friends were heckled: 'You look like you're just out of nappies. Go and get a f**king job'.  JSO's graphic designer who won't have a baby until she tries to 'fix the world':  Gabriella Ditton Another JSO activist is graphic designer Gabriella Ditton, 27, from Norfolk, who was arrested for blocking oil trucks on Friday.  In a newspaper interview, Ms Ditton - who attended Wymondham College in Norfolk, where annual boarding fees are more than PS12,000 - bragged: 'I've been arrested 16 times and it's honestly fine.' She has stripped naked and covered her body in oil at protests. The group said: 'Gabriella would love nothing more than to have a family and continue her career as a graphic designer, but feels those things aren't an option for her anymore because of the state of the world'. The 27-year-old, who works as an animator, became hooked after going to an Extinction Rebellion talk. She said: 'I was getting my life in order to have a baby and went to the Heading for Extinction talk. I realised I couldn't bring a baby into the world before trying to fix it first. 'I started the way everyone does, with petitions, emailing my MP, going on marches. But I realised it doesn't work. In the future, I want to be able to say with total sincerity that I did everything I could and really mean it. I'm so frightened about society falling apart - I'm so deadly terrified that I will do literally anything to prevent it from happening'. Organic farmer and XR co-founder who branded the Holocaust 'just another f**kery in human history': Roger Hallam Roger Hallam is the co-founder of Extinction Rebellion who believes paralysing traffic will eventually cause food shortages and trigger uprisings. He once stood unsuccessfully in the 2019 European Parliament election in the London constituency as an independent, winning 924 of the 2,241,681 votes cast, which was around 0.04 per cent of the vote. He became interested in climate change in his 40s when an organic farm he ran in south Wales went bankrupt because of extreme weather conditions. Hallam went on hunger strike in 2017 to demand King's College London stop investing in fossil fuels. His stated ambition for the group is to 'bring down all the regimes in the world and replace them', starting with Britain. He encouraged his followers to get arrested at demonstrations en-masse as a way of raising awareness of climate change. In a recent video on YouTube, he said protesters should be ready to cause disruption through personal 'sacrifice'. If necessary, they 'should be willing to die'. In 2019 he apologised for comments he made describing the Holocaust as 'just another f**kery in human history'. Hallam, 55, sparked outrage in Germany by comparing the murder of six million Jewish people at the hands of the Nazis to other historical massacres and claiming that the memory of the Shoah - or Holocaust - was holding Germany back. The former organic farmer was quickly condemned by Extinction Rebellion groups in Germany, as well as the German government after his comments to a newspaper in the country. ",
  "3fa33689843f1fa6f22feba41afee8f86ebe026c2ff9b24081e63785": "Boris Johnson lashed out at one of his own MPs accused of watching pornography in the House of Commons today, hinting he faces being kicked out of the Conservative Party.  The Prime Minister said the behaviour alleged by several female MPs was 'totally unacceptable' as he made a campaign visit to Burnley. Cabinet members said the culprit should be stripped of the whip or even kicked out of the House if they the allegations are proven.  But former minister Caroline Nokes has accused the chief whip of kicking the issue 'into the long grass', and said the whip should have been suspended already.  Speaking to reporters in Lancashire, Mr Johnson was asked whether the parliamentarian would lose the Conservative whip if the allegations are proven. 'I think it's obviously unacceptable for anybody to be doing that kind of thing in the workplace,' he said. 'It would be the same for any kind of job up and down the country, let's be absolutely clear about that. 'What needs to happen now is that the proper procedures need to be gone through, the independent complaints and grievances procedure needs to be activated and we need to get to understand the facts, but, yeah, that kind of behaviour is clearly totally unacceptable.' It came as the sleaze issue crossed the aisle, with a Labour frontbencher accused of telling one of his party's female MPs they were a 'secret weapon' because men wanted to sleep with them. The female politician - who wants to remain anonymous - was allegedly subjected to the lewd remark at an event in Westminster. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace also urged MPs to stay out of Parliament's 'poisonous' drinking dens amid growing uproar at sexism and sleaze at Westminster. Mr Wallace said the long hours and access to alcohol had been a problem for many years, and his advice to colleagues was 'finish your day's work and go home'. In the latest grim claims, a woman MP told BBC Wales that when someone praised her as a 'rising star' of her party at an event, the unnamed shadow cabinet minister intervened.  They apparently said she was a 'secret weapon' because 'women want to be her friend' and men wanted to sleep with her. 'She is a vote winner,' they reportedly added. Keir Starmer said: 'I'm deeply concerned to hear these suggestions and these allegations. 'There is a complaints procedure and I want everybody to have the confidence to use that complaints procedure because I would want to get to the bottom of this and do something about it.' A Labour spokeswoman said: 'The Labour Party takes all complaints extremely seriously.    'They are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures, and any appropriate action is taken.' It is understood that no complaint has been received, and BBC Wales said the woman did not want to be identified for fear of consequences.  Labour has recently introduced a new independent complaints procedure to boost confidence, and is encouraging people to come forward. In a round of interviews this morning, Mr Wallace said 'there's no place for pornography in any workplace' and said there needs to be a cultural change in Westminster. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I certainly think they should lose the whip.' He pointed to the handful of exclusive bars on the Parliamentary estate, where drinks are much cheaper than outside, with a pint of beer costing around PS3.60. Mr Wallace told Times Radio that there were 'fights', 'sexist comments' and 'propositions' in the bars.  'What I have witnessed is, what I think is the fundamental problem of Westminster, is the overall culture is that hundreds and hundreds of people (are) working long hours in a place with bars,' he said. 'And for some people, under lots of pressure for all sorts of reasons. And that... mix becomes poisonous.'  Mr Wallace said the problems had been 'going on for decades' and were 'not easy to fix'.  'I mean, my advice to any MP is actually avoid the bars, you know, finish a day's work and go home.  'But you know, that is part of the ultimate challenge around parliament that I think needs to be fixed.  'And you know, in the Armed Forces, I have a similar challenge, which is often in those high pressure environments where people mix and then alcohol is consumed, you end up in a place where people do things, either they regret, or things that is totally unacceptable.'  The Defence Secretary told Sky News: 'There is a range of allegations that go right across the House, go right across the parties. 'This is a problem, I think, about the overall culture of the House of Commons. 'It is late sitting, long nights with bars, and that very often leads, and it has done for decades, to behavioural challenges... 'I think it's really important that we think about ways to change the culture in the House of Commons.' Attorney General Suella Braverman told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour that if the allegation of an MP watching porn in Parliament is proven there should be a 'severe reprimand' including an opportunity to oust them from the Commons. 'I'm shocked and appalled... what would possess them? It is totally unacceptable,' she said. 'I am very glad that the chief whip has now referred it to the independent complaints and grievance process.' Ms Braverman went on: 'I think we would really need to see a situation where the whip would be removed. I am ashamed that this person is carrying the Conservative rosette. 'I think they really do need to be subject to a recall, and no longer holding their privileged position as a member of parliament.' Ms Braverman said while all the men she had worked with were 'respectful' there were MPs who behaved like 'animals'.  'There is however, a very small minority of men - and it is men - who fall short, and there are some bad apples who are out of order, who behave like animals and are bringing parliament into disrepute to be honest,' she said. 'I don't think we should be saying there is a pervasive culture. That is not my experience. There are certain individuals who are behaving in an unacceptable way.'   The Conservative Party's chief whip has ordered an official investigation into claims that an MP was watching porn on his mobile phone in the House of Commons Chamber. A spokesman said the matter would be referred to Parliament's independent complaints and grievance scheme (ICGS). 'Following allegations of inappropriate behaviour in the House of Commons the Chief Whip has asked that this matter be referred to the ICGS. 'Upon the conclusion of any ICGS investigation the Chief Whip will take appropriate action.'  Ms Nokes told PoliticsHome the referral amounted to 'kicking it into the long grass' and it would be 'months before anything is done'. 'It's not shouldering the burden of responsibility of dealing with it, and I think the Chiefs should have dealt with it immediately,' she said.  Sir Keir said the Conservative Party should 'take action now' against the MP. He said: 'I think it's very good that we've got an independent system and obviously that requires anonymity. 'This is an unusual case because the Tory Party knows who this individual is. 'I think that they should deal with it and deal with it sooner rather than later and take appropriate action. 'So, nothing wrong with the independent process, but I think the Tory Party, they know who this is, they should take action now.' Those reported to the body are given automatic anonymity, meaning the Tory MP's name will not be published while he is under investigation. Only witnesses are able to make complaints to the scheme. The body is said to be investigating at least 56 MPs - including three ministers and two shadow ministers - who have been accused of sexual misconduct. Two female MPs say they witnessed their colleague looking at adult images more than once.",
  "2eded63737c9ecc66ae2dd63bceaf6c16cfeaa8355d9bbf358ae0c4d": "Former Doctor Who and Eastenders star Ann Davies has died aged 87. The actress, who was the wife of the late Richard Briers - who starred in The Good Life - and mother to two daughters, passed away on Thursday, her agent has confirmed. Barry Langford tweeted: 'Sadly my lovely client of 34 years Ann Davies passed away yesterday. 'A superb actress with TV credits including #DoctorWho and #TheSculptress, Ann was devoted to her beloved late husband #RichardBriers and their daughters Lucy and Kate. 'She will be very much missed. #RIP Annie.' Davies starred in a string of Doctor Who episodes in the 1960s playing the character of Jenny alongside William Hartnell as the Time Lord, before going on to play teacher Mrs Singleton in Grange Hill during the 1990s.  The actress also appeared in BBC dramas Doctors and Eastenders, as well as acting alongside her husband Richard in a number of television roles prior to his death in 2013.   The couple had lived together in Chiswick, west London, after marrying in 1956 and had two daughters Lucy and Katie. Lucy, 54, plays Mrs Blish in ITV's Endeavour and featured as Mary Bennet in the 1995 BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice.  Ann's husband Richard was known to millions as the lynchpin of three of the most notable sitcoms ever made in Britain - Marriage Lines, The Good Life and Ever Decreasing Circles.  The star, who was also well-known for his Shakespearean roles, had been battling a serious lung condition for years before he died 'peacefully' at his London home in February 2013.  The couple appeared together in films Peter's Friends in 1992 and In the Bleak Midwinter in 1995, as well as a radio adaptation of the television series Brothers in Law. Mr Briers was one of the most popular television sitcom actors of his generation. After leaving school in Surrey with meagre qualifications, Briers flirted with the idea of electrical engineering as a career, before realising that what he really wanted to do was tread the boards, not wire them. He attended RADA from 1954 to 1956, then joined Liverpool Repertory Company. It was while at Liverpool rep that he met Mrs Davies. Theirs would be that rare thing in the theatrical world -- a long, stable and happy marriage.  Following Richard's death, Dame Sheila Hancock described them as a 'wonderful couple'. She said: ''It's really not easy in our profession, but they were a wonderful couple and we were very close to them.'",
  "84d46924bde076c6342a67954ee71fbd6c842c2904480a7cdb8ff167": "Midwifery students at a top Scottish university were taught biological men could get pregnant and trans men could give birth even if they have a penis. MailOnline can reveal the PS9,000-a-year undergraduate course at Edinburgh Napier University included a woke module on caring for 'birthing people'.    In a coursebook that has since been revised, trainee midwives were given detailed instructions on how to treat a male-to-female trans person during childbirth. It is not possible for someone born a man to get pregnant or give birth with current technology or medicine.  The book's introduction stated: 'You may be caring for a pregnant or birthing person who is transitioning from male to female and may still have external male genitalia.' Another section with photo demonstrations detailed how to fit a catheter in a person with a penis and scrotum during labour.  The book also included special instructions for people with prostate glands -- which are exclusive to biological men -- who may feel particular 'discomfort'. Several experts criticised the university, describing the woke course material as 'remarkably ignorant about basic biology, sex and anatomy'.  Bosses at the university have changed the wording to say 'people transitioning from female to male' rather than 'male to female', following the uproar. But all references to handling a penis, prostate gland and other male genitalia remain, according to Reduxx, which first broke the story. The way the manual has been edited creates more confusion because it suggests midwives can expect to treat biological females with penises. Reduxx did not name the university, but MailOnline understands it is Edinburgh Napier -- just one of four in Scotland that offers an undergraduate, accredited midwifery course.  MailOnline has approached Napier repeatedly for comment. Dr Leila Hanna, a private gynaecologist and obstetrician, said universities should focus on teaching midwives 'what's actually doable'. She told MailOnline: 'A lot of things need to be done to arrive at the technology to be able to do that (a biological man giving birth).  'We would have to be able to give men wombs and then put eggs and sperm in there -- I've not seen any publications to say we've arrived at that technology yet. 'Let's focus on improving what we do, and what's doable, but let's not go dreaming of things which are probably not going to happen tomorrow.' Only people who are born female can make eggs, which means it is not possible for a male-to-female trans woman to get pregnant naturally. Only people who are born female can make eggs, which means it is not possible for a male-to-female trans woman to get pregnant naturally. Scientists believe it is theoretically possible to impregnate a trans woman using IVF, when the eggs are fertilised outside the body and then inserted.  But it would require a healthy womb for the child to grow in, and transplant operations are years if not decades away from making that a reality.  There has only ever been one documented case of a womb being transplanted into a trans woman born male-- but she died from complications just months later. Female-to-male transgender people can still get pregnant. But only if they have not had a hysterectomy as part of their transition or have taken hormone-blocking drugs that stop them from producing eggs. There are no definitive figures when it comes to how many transgender people have given birth worldwide, or in Britain. Seventy-five people who identified as male gave birth in Australia in 2020, the most comparable country with data. Scientists believe it is theoretically possible to impregnate a trans woman using IVF, when the eggs are fertilised outside the body and then inserted.  But it would require a healthy womb for the foetus to grow in, and transplant operations are years if not decades away from making that a reality.  There has only ever been one documented case of a womb being transplanted into a trans woman born male -- but she died from complications just months later. Female-to-male transgender people can still get pregnant, provided they have not had a hysterectomy as part of their transition or have taken hormone-blocking drugs that stop them from producing eggs. There are no definitive figures when it comes to how many transgender people have given birth worldwide, or in Britain. Seventy-five people who identified as male gave birth in Australia in 2020, the most comparable country with data. Students on the Napier course said they were handed a 'Skills Workbook' in a module about how to care for patients giving birth last month. It told them on two separate occasions the 'birthing person' may be a biological male.  So students need to be familiar with inserting catheters for people with 'female and male anatomy', it said. A catheter is sometimes fitted during C-sections or when women are given certain drugs which mean they cannot go to the toilet. Section 4.4 of the manual shows several images of a catheter being fitted on a male figurine's penis and scrotum. One instruction says: 'Wrap a sterile swab around the penis and, with the same non-touch technique, retract the foreskin if present.' 'Place sterile towel across the person's thighs, ensuring the scrotal area is covered,' adds another. Different doses of analgesic gel should also be used depending on whether the pregnant person is male or female, the book claims - with 6ml for women and 11ml for men. Students are instructed to take extra care with 'male persons' who have prostate glands, which are exclusive to biological males.  Removing the catheter may provide particular 'discomfort as the deflated balloon passes through the prostate gland', it claimed.  Dr Susan Bewley, emeritus professor in obstetrics and women's health at King's College London, described the coursework as 'puzzling'. She is quoted by Reduxx as saying: 'There are no circumstances whereby qualified midwives can possibly be asked, or be expected, to catheterise a penis as part of their professional work. 'The writers seem to have left school remarkably ignorant about basic biology, sex and anatomy.' According to Reduxx, which describes itself as a 'pro-woman news and commentary' website, the handbook has been edited to remove claims that a biological man can get pregnant. But it now claims that a biological female can have a child even if she has a penis that has been surgically constructed through a phalloplasty, the site claims.  Dr Bewley added: 'A few [female-to-males] undergo genital surgery but, in general, those with a surgically created neo-penis simply cannot get pregnant either because they undergo a hysterectomy as a prelude. 'These materials are the opposite of the high-quality training that patients need from midwives and doctors.  'The project may have arisen from compassion and enthusiasm, but it is worrying that the writers don't seem to know, care about, or check facts.' The three-year midwifery course at Edinburgh Napier costs PS1,820 per year to Scottish students, which is subsidised by the Government. Students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland have to pay PS9,250 annually.",
  "c42a970bfad25d03a8f3463f5ea818434e00e33ec140053e9ed85130": "Maternity services should use 'inclusive' terms like 'chestfeeding' so trans pregnant people aren't offended, a Government-funded report says.  The report, from the LGBT Foundation, made the recommendation after surveying 121 trans Britons on their experience of pregnancy. Another example of a gender-loaded term is 'vaginal birth', recommending 'frontal' or 'lower birth' instead. The report said inclusive terms should be used across NHS services and people and national guidance should be introduced to ensure pregnant trans have the option of their preferred words. 'It is not possible to guess the language someone might use to describe themselves based on how they look or sound, or who they are in a relationship with,' the report reads.  The charity also says some trans and non-binary people would benefit from having a private space in hospitals to give birth, so that they are not made uncomfortable by seeing women.  It detailed the experience of one trans person, who said: 'I didn't have to go to a ward full of women after giving birth, I was actually provided with a private room for me and baby which was very helpful and accommodating for me and my gender identity.'  NHS services are currently in a 'woke' storm of de-gendering language surrounding women and pregnancy.  Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust is now referring to breastmilk as 'human milk' in official guidance. The new report was commissioned by the Health & Wellbeing Alliance, a partnership between charities and the NHS, which is managed jointly by the Department of Health and Social Care and Office for Health Improvement and Disparities. It lays out a series of recommendations in its 'Trans + Non Binary Experiences of Maternity Services' report. The charity said a third pregnant trans and non-nonbinary parents surveyed reported not engaging with perinatal care during their pregnancy. This compares to just 2.1 per cent of  the general population. Of the survey respondents, 59 per cent said healthcare professionals did not speak to them in a way which reflected their gender. Midwifery students at a top Scottish university were wrongly taught biological men could get pregnant and trans men could give birth even if they have a penis. MailOnline can reveal the PS9,000-a-year undergraduate course at Edinburgh Napier University included a woke module on caring for 'birthing people'.

Several experts criticised the university, describing the woke course material as 'remarkably ignorant about basic biology, sex and anatomy'.  Bosses at the university have changed the wording to say 'people transitioning from female to male' rather than 'male to female', following the uproar. Additionally, 28 per cent of respondents said they had not been treated with 'dignity and respect' during both labour and birth.   One respondent, described as a disabled, non-binary, queer, Black British African, said: 'I felt there was no framework of language that was inclusive of people who do not identify within the gender binary so it was consistently a triggering experience.' Another trans person said a midwife attributed their postnatal depression to them knowing 'deep down' that they should stop the transition.  'When I suffered from some depression after having my baby a midwife suggested it was because 'deep down I knew I didn't want to transition anymore' this was deeply unhelpful and made me feel even worse,' they said.     And fewer than half of those surveyed said their decisions around how to feed their baby were respected by midwives. This, the LGBT Foundation claimed, 'suggests potential harm for the birthing parent through disrespectful interaction, and to the baby where there are unresolved questions about feeding.' They detailed the experience of another trans person, who said his baby's tongue-tie, a condition where the shape of a child's tongue makes it harder to breastfeed, was missed as medical professionals 'assumed' he could not produce milk. 'My baby's tongue tie was not treated early because it was assumed I wouldn't chest feed at all, when in fact I could have,' he said.  The report's authors also said racism experienced by Black and Asian trans people was also a factor in poorer pregnancy care for these demographics. In its report, the LGBT Foundation name a fictional person called Cam, a 'Black Caribbean non-binary transmasculine person going through their second pregnancy', as an example of how NHS maternity services should be run.  'Cam' had a traumatic first birth where they concealed their gender identity and is, therefore, reluctant to engage with perinatal care services.  The LGBT Foundation list a variety of ways services could be made more inclusive for Cam, such as using language like 'pregnant people' instead of 'pregnant women'. It also recommends the use of terms like 'chestfeeding' or 'bodyfeeding' instead of breastfeeding.  Other examples include having NHS staff with identity badges which show their preferred pronouns, gender-inclusive training for midwives, and NHS data tracking outcomes for trans and non-binary pregnancies. The survey responders were recruited via social media between November 2020 and March 2021 and were then interviewed about their experience by the LGBT Foundation.",
  "b486300eed4fe5ae54e3a7e6e708629763d938724e72f22fc2f9af98": "Defence Secretary Ben Wallace today declared it is 'not the Government's business to run' Channel 4 as ministers pushed on with selling the broadcaster as well as reining in the BBC and Netflix. The TV company has been publicly owned since it was founded by Margaret Thatcher in 1982 - but the Tories are forging ahead with plans to privatise it, claiming public ownership is holding it back from competing with streaming giants. Ministers will today release a blueprint that will also signal the death knell for the licence fee by saying the Government is 'ready to implement a new way of funding the BBC'.   They will also give the UK media watchdog the power to draft and enforce a new video-on-demand code, aimed at setting standards for 'larger TV-like services' such as Netflix, ITV Hub and Now TV to level the rules with traditional broadcasters. The maximum fine for a breach of the code will be PS250,000 or an amount up to 5% of their revenue, whichever is higher. Mr Wallace has said he feels Channel 4 produces some 'great creative content' but that it is 'not the Government's business to run a television channel'. He spoke as the Government releases a White Paper which provides a first look at proposed plans for the channel to be privatised. Speaking to ITV News, Mr Wallace said: 'It'll be good for it. Channel 4 will be able to commission or actually produce its own work, not just commission from other people or productions. 'It will allow it to raise funds in a way that it can't do when it's a nationalised organisation. It will be allowed to compete and produce further good programming.' Today's white paper promises a 'golden age' of programming and make the British broadcasting system 'fit for the streaming age', including:  The BBC's Director General says the Corporation's attempt to claw back young viewers is set to end as it fights with streaming services to reclaim older audiences. The broadcaster had made vigorous efforts to attract the vaunted 16-34 demographic since former BBC boss Lord Hall of Birkenhead instigated a 'lurch to youth' in 2020. Programmes beloved by an older generation, including Eggheads, had budgets slashed or were axed entirely amid a rush to prioritise the 'lives and passions' of younger viewers. After these changes, a 2020 Ofcom report found satisfaction levels with the BBC were waning among older and more middle class viewers.  But this week, Director General Tim Davie insisted the corporation's core channels, BBC One and BBC Two, should be appealing to as wide an audience as possible. He said: 'I don't believe in a big lurch to youth in the BBC. We need to be healthily paranoid about making sure we give value to people aged 16 to 34, and 16 and under for children's provision, but I don't think it means you have to skew everything young in any shape or form. 'Good quality news, outstanding natural history and dramas are often liked by [young viewers].'   Ben Wallace added that he felt the broadcaster produced 'some great creative stuff' but that some of its content 'could be perfectly done by any commercial thing'. But while visiting Workington in Cumbria, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer was asked if it was right for Channel 4 to be privatised, and he said it was wrong - although admitted that voters were preoccupied with other matters. He said: 'No, it isn't right that Channel 4 should be privatised, there's no case for it. 'But, I have to say as I go round Workington and other places, nobody is talking to me about Channel 4, they're all talking to me about the fact they can't pay their bills. 'On behalf of all of them I'd say to the Government, for heaven's sake, focus on the things that people are really concerned about - paying the bills, the tax hike the Government has imposed on you - not privatising Channel 4.' The Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries has taken aim at the BBC today. She said the current model is 'completely outdated' and that in the coming months ministers would be 'looking very seriously about how we fund the BBC'.  Mrs Dorries said she was also considering how media regulator Ofcom could 'hold the BBC to account'.  In January she had appeared to indicate the end of the licence fee when she said the latest funding deal would be its last, before subsequently toning down her remarks.  But in a new interview with The Spectator she once again appeared to signal that the TV licence system of funding the corporation would be killed off.  'We are going to very soon announce that we are going to be looking very seriously about how we fund the BBC,' she said.  Mrs Dorries added that decisions about the matter will be taken 'well ahead' of the corporation's charter renewal at the end of 2027, saying: 'We are ready to implement a new way of funding the BBC.'  She told the magazine: 'We're going to be looking at how Ofcom hold the BBC to account and then very shortly after that we will be announcing other measures that we are going to put into place to start looking at how the BBC will be funded in the future so that we are well in time to have that in place for the charter renewal.'  A broadcasting white paper released today is expected to say that the Government will carry out a review of the licence fee funding model ahead of the next charter period, with more detailed plans laid out in the coming months.  In January, Mrs Dorries confirmed that the licence fee would be frozen at PS159 for the next two years, before increasing by roughly 10 per cent over the following four years.  At the same time she said on social media that this licence fee announcement 'will be the last'.  She had also heralded an end to the 'days of the elderly being threatened with prison sentences and bailiffs knocking on doors' over non-payment of the licence fee. But she later softened her public approach, saying in Parliament that it was 'time to begin asking really serious questions about the long-term funding model of the BBC'.  A Whitehall source said yesterday that 'no decision has been made on what the BBC's future funding model will look like'.  The Culture Secretary has previously criticised the BBC's 'elitist' and 'snobbish' approach and has accused the corporation of having too few working-class staff. Among possible alternatives to the licence fee are some form of voluntary subscription model like Netflix uses, or allowing the BBC to have advertising, or through a general broadband levy.  There have also been suggestions about linking a charge to people's council tax - which generally increase with wealth rather than being a flat rate - while others have proposed a hybrid model which combines more than one of these ideas.  Instead, more general rules about 'reflecting all parts and people of the UK' and 'democratically impactful content' will be brought in.  Most of the current rules do not apply to the BBC because it is governed by its charter, but it affects commercial public service broadcasters such as ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5.  When it was launched by the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1982, Channel 4 was given the remit of appealing to tastes that weren't catered for on the three existing television channels.    Until then, the public broadcaster BBC and its commercial rival ITV had held a duopoly over Britain's TV screens.  The first voice heard on the new channel when it launched on November 2, 1982, was that of continuity announcer Paul Coia. He said: 'Good afternoon. It's a pleasure to be able to say to you welcome to Channel Four.' After a montage of clips that were played to the sound of the channel's signature tune, the first show to air was an episode of quiz show Countdown that was presented by Carol Vorderman and Richard Whiteley. Previously, Countdown had only aired in pilot form before being bought by Channel 4. The first advert to air on the channel was for car maker Vauxhall. On its first day, the channel also broadcast soap opera Brookside, which was created by Phil Redmond. In the 1980 Broadcasting Act, the Government said Channel 4, which was headed up by chief executive Jeremy Isaacs, would have to provide 'a suitable proportion of matter calculated to appeal to tastes and interests not generally catered for.' The channel was also asked to screen 'educational' programmes which 'encourage innovation and experiment'. As well as Countdown and Brookside, Channel 4 also became known for hit comedy Father Ted, late night show The Word and many other popular programmes.  More recent shows, including the likes of Naked Attraction and Sex Box, have attracted criticism from some viewers for allegedly being inappropriate.  The former is a dating show in which contestants' bodies - including their private parts - are slowly revealed from the feet up. In the latter, couples who featured on the show had sex in a box on stage.  The channel has also been slammed for its alleged left-wing bias in recent years. Channel 4's creation was part of a raft of changes to Britain's media landscape during Mrs Thatcher's time in office.  The changes brought in by Mrs Thatcher also included the launch of breakfast station TV-am and the insistence that independent producers should make much of the shows that were appearing on Britain's television screens. Before the changes, the BBC and ITV had made nearly all their shows in-house. From the outset, Channel 4 was also obligated to get 'a substantial proportion' of its programmes from independent producers. It was funded by advertising and sponsorship deals. Before Channel 4's launch, a government report had concluded that 'the younger generation of producers is bubbling over with ideas which are not allowed to surface.' Writing to mark Brookside's 30th anniversary in 2012, Redmond said Channel 4 'made a huge, immediate impact' because it was given a remit to 'cater for minorities and find voices that were unheard'. 'It certainly lived up to that. It allowed new people to be seen on TV, with new ideas and voices,' he added. However, the channel was hit by controversy after less than 24 hours of being on air, when members of the Deaf Broadcasting Campaign besieged its London headquarters to complain that there was a lack of news programmes for the deaf. The first major drama to air on the channel was Walter, the story of a mentally handicapped man played by Ian McKellen. In recent years, it has become known for its left-leaning coverage. In 2017, it was claimed that former lead presenter Jon Snow joined in a chant of 'F*** The Tories' while attending the Glastonbury festival and in 2019 there was a grovelling apology after the veteran presenter said he had 'never seen so many white people in one place' while reporting on a pro-Brexit rally. And after an attack on two gay women on a London bus, a reporter was accused of 'coaxing' the couple into blaming Boris Johnson for the homophobic crime and saying that he was 'not fit to lead the UK'. In 2019 Ofcom rejected a Conservative complaint over Channel 4's use of an ice sculpture to stand in for the PM during a debate on climate change, after a subtitler mistakenly reported him saying 'people of colour' when he said 'people of talent' at a rally. The channel is also known for its programming for young people and 'property porn' shows such as Grand Designs and Location, Location, Location. It is also home of the Great British Bake Off and known for its groundbreaking drama. Recent show It's A Sin was lauded for its portrayal of the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1980s. Channel 4 is commercially funded. It raised revenues of PS985million in 2019, but a pre-tax loss of PS26million. Selling Channel 4 could be seen as something of an easy win for the Government, as it seeks to find new savings. The taxpayer has a 100 per cent shareholding in Channel 4 but relatively few viewers are even aware that it is state-owned. When proposals to privatise the channel were first raised in 1988, Mrs Thatcher rejected them over fears the broadcaster would be forced to abandon its public service remit. After a series of meetings over the issue, Mrs Thatcher decided that commercial pressures faced by the newly privatised channel would mean its role in catering for underserved audiences and taking risks with new programmes would be threatened. A minute of the meeting that was revealed in Government papers last year read: 'It was extremely doubtful whether the Channel's distinctive remit would be sustained by a profit-driven organisation in a highly competitive climate.' The committee chaired by Mrs Thatcher had also warned that the Government would be vulnerable to a defeat if the privatisation was put to a vote in the Parliament. ",
  "48c908ffa116edad29fda4af8bd3d414b25c9ed0f4f016d89b3d7322": "Boris Johnson is facing a potentially make-or-break moment next week when millions of voters go to the polls across the country. Tories are anxiously waiting to assess the level of damage from the Partygate scandal, with the results in thousands of council seats seen as a key test of whether the PM can survive.  A total of 200 local authorities are holding elections - including every seat in Scotland, Wales and London.  But the outcome could be tricky to interpret as many of the seats were last contested in 2017 and 2018, when the UK was still in the EU, Theresa May was in No10 and Labour was led by Jeremy Corbyn. Experts have pointed out that Labour had a very strong performance in 2018, suggesting the party could struggle to make further big gains - despite polls showing a national lead and massive advantage in London.    Although many of the issues that decide local elections remain the same - such as bin collections and services - they will inevitably be interpreted through the prism of Partygate in the wake of Mr Johnson's fine. Restive Conservatives have been holding off a decision on whether to mount a coup until the results come in, meaning the aftermath is likely to be the moment of maximum danger for the PM.  Meanwhile, a failure to make significant progress could cause serious problems for Keir Starmer.  Here are some of the key contests to look out for in each region of England, as well as in Wales and Scotland. North-west England Bury - estimated declaration time, 8.30pm Friday May 6 Bury has all of its 51 seats up for grabs this year. Labour has run the council since 2011 but has only a small majority and will want to improve its position in what is the party's traditional heartland of Greater Manchester. Bury's status in this year's elections was reflected by the fact Sir Keir and Mr Johnson both visited the town during the campaign. (E) Bolton - 12.30am Friday May 6 Bolton is another key test for Labour in Greater Manchester, but here it is hoping to take back control from the Conservatives who have run a minority administration since 2019. A third of the council's 60 seats are being contested. (12.30am) Pendle - 4.30pm Friday, May 6 Pendle is being defended by the Conservatives, who won a slim majority last year. If the Tories lose two seats, the council will slip back into no overall control. Elections are taking place for 12 of the 33 seats. (4.30pm) Cumberland and Westmorland & Furness - 1pm Friday, May 6  Two new unitary authorities that will elect councillors for the first time this year. The two authorities cover the whole of Cumbria. Cumberland is comprised of the former district councils of Allerdale, Carlisle and Copeland, while Westmorland & Furness covers Barrow-in-Furness, Eden and South Lakeland. All the main parties will be jostling for prominence in these new 'super-councils' and the outcome in both contests could be close. (Cumberland 2.30am, Westmorland & Furness 1pm) North-east England Sunderland - 2am Friday, May 6 Run by Labour since 1973, but both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have made advances in Sunderland in recent years. A third of the council's 75 seats are up for grabs this year, and if Labour suffers six or more losses it will lose overall control. Although Sunderland is part of Labour's so-called 'Red Wall' - areas of the country that saw many Tory gains at the 2019 general election - all three Sunderland MPs are Labour and the party defied predictions in 2021 when it retained its majority on the council.  Hartlepool - 2am Friday, May 6  The Conservatives and Labour are fighting to be in with a chance of taking overall control of the council - or failing that, end up the largest party and lead a minority administration or a coalition. The Tories won the parliamentary seat of Hartlepool from Labour at a by-election in May 2021. A strong showing by independent candidates could spice up the outcome of this year's contest. Some 13 of the council's 36 seats are being contested. Yorkshire & the Humber Kirklees - 6.30pm Friday, May 6 Currently run by Labour but the party does not have a majority in Kirklees. A third of seats are being elected and just two gains by Labour would give it overall control. Both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats are also hoping to do well.  Wakefield - 5pm Friday, May 6 A Labour stronghold and is not likely to change hands, but the party will be hoping for a solid performance ahead of the expected parliamentary by-election in the city later this year, after Conservative MP Imran Khan was convicted of sexual assault. A third of seats are being contested.  Hull - 3.30am Friday, May 6  Hull is a two-way fight between Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Labour's majority has been whittled away in recent years and the party goes into this year's election defending a majority of one. A third of the council's seats are in play and the Lib Dems are hopeful of victory. (3.30am) West Midlands Dudley - 4am Friday, May 6 A crucial test for both the Conservatives and Labour. The Tories hope to build on the slim majority they secured at the 2021 local elections, while Labour will want to halt the blue advance and make gains themselves. A third of the council is up for grabs. (4am) Solihull - 1pm Friday May 6 Another West Midlands metropolitan council under Conservative control, but the main opposition is the Greens. The party has been slowly eating into the Tories' majority and will hope to take a few more bites this year. One third of Solihull's seats are being contested. Nuneaton & Bedworth - 4am Friday May 6 Dominated by the Conservatives after a bumper performance in last year's elections. Labour will hope to demonstrate it is making a comeback, having controlled the council as recently as 2018. Half of the 34 seats are holding ballots. Newcastle-under-Lyme - 3pm Friday May 6 Set to be a battle royal between Labour and the Conservatives, with every council seat up for grabs and the Tories defending a tiny majority. Success here for Labour would suggest the party is winning back support in one of its target areas of country. The parliamentary seat of Newcastle-under-Lyme was won by the Conservatives in 2019 after being held by Labour for the previous 100 years.  East Midlands Derby - 5am Friday May 6 Derby is currently run by the Tories as a minority party. Labour will be looking to make gains in another test of party's ability to win back support in urban areas of central England. An unknown factor is the popularity of the Reform Derby party, based on the former Brexit Party, which is standing candidates in all the seats being contested. There are 17 of the council's 51 seats up for grabs.  Eastern England St Albans - 4pm Friday May 6 St Albans saw the Liberal Democrats make enough gains in 2021 to take overall control, but with a slim majority. The party will want to improve its numbers this year as an example of how it is now the main opposition to the Conservatives in parts of the so-called 'Blue Wall' of southern England. The entire council is up for election. (4pm) Peterborough - 2.30am Friday May 6  A long-running Conservative-Labour battleground and for decades the council has see-sawed between a Tory majority and no overall control. It is currently run by a minority Conservative administration and Labour will want to make gains to show it is recovering in a city it lost to the Tories at the 2019 general election. A third of seats are being contested.  Basildon - 1am Friday May 6 This Essex battleground could provide clues to how the Conservatives are doing in the commuter belt around London. The party won control of the council last year and will hope to consolidate its position in elections for a third of its 42 seats.  Stevenage - 2.30am Friday, May 6 A commuter-heavy area in Hertfordshire, but this time it is Labour who will be hoping to make progress. The party has controlled the council continuously since its creation in 1973 but will want to show it can reverse the losses it made last year. A third of the seats are up for grabs.  London Barnet - 7am Friday May 6 Labour's top target in London for the third election in a row. The party failed narrowly to win control in 2014, while 2018 saw the council swing further towards the Conservatives, with local Labour members blaming the row over antisemitism in the national party. Labour needs to gain nine seats to form a majority. As with every council in London, all seats are being elected.  Wandsworth - 5.30am Friday May 6 Another long-standing Labour target, but here the party managed to increased its number of councillors in both 2014 and 2018. The Tories have held the council since 1978 and have made a point of charging residents one of the lowest average levels of council tax in the country, so a Labour victory would be of symbolic significance.  Hillingdon - 4am Friday May 6  This borough contains the constituency of the Prime Minister and has been controlled by the Conservatives since 2006. Labour is hoping to make gains, but the outcome is hard to predict as the size of the council is being cut from 65 to 53 seats. Westminster - 3am Friday May 6 A flagship borough held by the Tories continuously since its creation in 1964. But Labour has slowly increased its number of councillors at recent elections and will want to make more progress this time. Given the current volatile political climate, plus a reduction in the size of the council from 60 to 54 seats, the final result could be close.  Harrow - 5pm Friday May 6  A council where the reduction in the number of seats from 63 to 55 could work in either Labour or the Conservatives' favour. Labour won a narrow majority in both 2014 and 2018 but the borough's electoral districts have been substantially redrawn for 2022 and both parties could profit from the new-look map.  Sutton - 4am Friday May 6 A Liberal Democrat-Conservative battleground that has been run by the Lib Dems since 1990. The party should retain control again this year, but the Tories will hope to make gains and chip away at the Lib Dems' small overall majority.  South-east England Crawley - 2pm Friday, May 6 Has tilted between Conservative and Labour control in recent years but neither party has an overall majority. It would take only a couple of gains for either the Tories or Labour to take full control of a council deep in the commuter belt of West Sussex. A third of seats are being contested.  Gosport - 5pm Friday May 6 The council sees the Conservatives, who have only a small majority, under pressure from the second-place Lib Dems. All the seats are up for grabs and boundary changes across the borough means the outcome will be even more unpredictable.  Worthing - 2pm Friday May 6 A top Labour target and the party goes into the election level-pegging with the Conservatives on 17 seats each. The Tories currently run the council as a minority administration but Labour has made steady gains in recent years and is hoping to take full control this year. A third of seats are being elected. Southampton - 5am Friday May 6 Another Labour target and winning control from the Conservatives would help demonstrate the party is building back support in southern towns and cities. The Tories are defending a majority of two and a third of the seats are being contested.  South-west England Somerset - 4pm Friday May 6 Undergoing major changes this year in its system of local government. Until now the area has had a county council and four district councils (Mendip, Sedgemoor, South Somerset and Somerset West & Taunton) but these are being scrapped and replaced with a single unitary authority. Elections are taking place for all 110 seats in the new-look organisation, with the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats fighting for control.  Wales Blaenau Gwent - 3pm Friday, May 6 This council has been run by a group of independents since 2017, some of whom used to be in the Labour Party. Labour is keen to take back control and might be helped by a reduction in the number of seats from 42 to 33.  Cardiff - 5pm Friday May 6 A key council for Labour, where the party will hope to defend its slim majority. The number of councillors is being increased slightly from 75 to 79, which might make the outcome more unpredictable.  Flintshire - 3pm Friday May 6  Sits in an area of Wales, the north east, where the Conservatives did well at the 2019 general election. The party won only six council seats in 2017 compared with Labour's 34, so they are hoping to make an advance this year. For its part, Labour will want to remain the largest party and even win a majority, although the total number of seats is being cut from 70 to 67.  Scotland Aberdeenshire - 3pm Friday May 6 A Conservative stronghold, but like many councils in Scotland, power is shared between several parties. All councils in Scotland are elected using the single transferable vote (STV) system, where voters rank candidates and results are based on preferences rather than the winner-takes-all method used in England. This leads to many councils ending in no overall control, but encourages parties to work together either informally or as part of a coalition. The Tories have run Aberdeenshire in partnership with the Lib Dems and a group of Independents. Their success this year may hinge on the popularity in Scotland of the Tories' UK leader Mr Johnson. East Renfrewshire - 2pm Friday May 6 A three-way battle between the Conservatives, Labour and the SNP with each hoping to end up the largest party.  Edinburgh - 3.30pm Friday May 6 The council has been run by a joint SNP-Labour administration for the last five years, but the Conservatives head into this election as the largest party on the council. The Lib Dems and Greens have a smaller number of councillors but both will hope to make gains from the larger parties.  Glasgow - 4pm Friday May 6  The council has been run by the SNP since 2017 in what has been their first stint in control of the city, albeit as a minority administration. The party needs only a few gains to take full control, but Labour - which had previously run the city since 1980 - is keen to stop them. ",
  "96354ccb92fbe959a1199ba2d63e5cb4b4e42fcc65657322b7d195a1": "Sir Ed Davey revealed the pain of having to administer morphine to his terminally ill mother as a child as he opened up about life as a young carer.  The Lib Dem leader was just four when his father John George died and at the age of 12 was left to care for his mother Nina when she was diagnosed with incurable cancer.   Davey, 56, appeared on ITV's Loose Women today where he spoke candidly about his childhood, revealing his mother was sometimes in so much agony she would give herself electric shocks to divert the pain.  The politician currently helps wife Emily care for their daughter Ellie, eight, and son John, 14, who was born with an undiagnosed neurological condition meaning he cannot walk or talk. Speaking about his mother, Nina, Davey said: 'First of all she was mobile, but gradually she was bed ridden and in a lot of pain.  'We used to have to give her morphine for the pain. It was a whole bell jar of morphine.  'Her pain was so bad we had to put these pads on her where she could give herself electric shocks to divert the pain and distract herself. She was in a lot of pain which was where the emotional side came in.'  He revealed that he often felt ostracised growing up because his role as a carer meant he couldn't take part in activities after school.  'At school I think one or two friends knew about it, but there was a sense of slightly being isolated or different,' he said.  'You couldn't always go to the parties, I had to give up rugby. Once or twice I was being bullied because I wasn't joining in. I think a lot of young carers feel that.'  Davey was incredibly close with his grandparents, who along with kindhearted neighbours helped him and his brother cope while caring for his mother.  When his mother died when he was 15, Ed moved in with his brothers and then his maternal grandparents, eventually securing a place at Oxford studying Politics, Philosophy and Economics.  'Previously I had worked to make my mum happy and I went through this rubicon where I thought 'I'm doing this for me now',' he explained.  'It was like a lightbulb, it made me focus on what I wanted to do in life... there was that moment and I think it does focus young minds.'  Davey married Emily Gasson, a former Liberal Democrat candidate for North Dorset, in the summer of 2005 and the couple had their first child John two years later.  The couple, who live in Surbiton, London, currently care for their disabled son with some help from external carers and Davey said that John will likely need full-time care for the rest of his life. Explaining that his wife takes on the majority of the care, he said: 'I like to be engaged because he's my lovely boy. So most of my caring is done in the morning or the weekends.'  When asked about his son's condition, he explained: 'We genuinely don't know....we felt when he was about four months and he wasn't developing well.  'We got to about nine months and we thought 'Something is wrong here'. He wasn't really sitting or engaging.  'They initially diagnosed him with cerebral palsy, but it wasn't cerebral palsy as it then transpired and Great Ormond Street Hospital were fantastic.'  Davey's experience as a carer drives much of his politics and he often campaigns for increased NHS investment and further government help for carers.  'I think caring roles should be valued far more', he said. 'Because I think they're quite tough actually. There's the emotional impact and then and actually caring is tough work, all hours it's not glamorous.' ",
  "b95502b538bdb4d9f1e415d76c1b381b7df39d184ef0d21d070e1590": "The sister of the hero PC blinded by fugitive gunman Raoul Moat today slammed ITV for not having the 'common decency' to let his family know they were making a TV drama out of the infamous gun siege. PC Rathband's sister Debbie Essery was stunned to learn the week-long stand of one of Britain's most-notorious killers was being filmed for a series called 'The Hunt For Raoul Moat'. Former bouncer Moat, 37, killed his ex-girlfriend Samantha Stobbart's new partner Chris Brown before shooting Samantha in the stomach in Birtley, Gateshead, shortly after his release from prison in July 2010. He then declared war on the police whilst on the run shooting PC David Rathband in the face whilst he was parked up in a patrol car on a roundabout in Newcastle. Blinded Rathband later tragically took his own life two years later. Moat shot himself dead after police closed in on him by a riverbank in Rothbury. Debbie, 59, a mother of two told MailOnline: 'The first I knew of the programme is when I read it in the news. It came as such a big shock my blood literally ran cold. 'No one from ITV consulted any of our family or that of Chris Brown to say they were filming the drama. It would have been common decency to tell us.  'Other broadcasters who have made programmes about the siege have always given us prior warning. 'We know we can't stop things like this but the families of all those involved should have been told. I had no clue.' It comes just days after the twin brother of Mr Rathband, who was shot and blinded by Raoul Moat, said he will not watch a new drama about the gunman. Darren Rathband, 54, said his family do not need any more reminders of what happened to his sibling 12 years ago. 'David loss gives us a painful reminder everyday. If it's based on facts and not fiction, the story remains the same,' he told ChroniceLive.  'I don't watch them, don't need to and never will. I sadly lived being involved in it.'  On announcing the drama ITV said: 'It will shine a light on the human tragedies that lay behind Britain's biggest manhunt, told through the eyes of those who sought to bring a violent killer to justice.' Debbie continued: 'I understand the nature of human inquisition but everybody knows what happened and those that don't can find out. We as a family went through the most horrific time so why make a tv show out of it. 'All it does is open old wounds and what for just to make ITV more millions. Please let my brother David and Chris Brown rest in peace and think of their families who still have to deal with the loss of their loved ones twelve years later. 'Even now I can't watch police documentaries and the sound of police sirens just set me off because not a day goes by without me thinking of the tragic events of that hot summer week and the aftermath of losing David.  'We lost our daughter so it is like a double loss for us after David took his own life. 'We now have a beautiful granddaughter as we didn't think we'd have another girl in the family so we have learned to cherish the happy moments in life. 'Now the news of this programme has cast a shadow over the whole family again.' Debbie from Newcastle added: 'Darren was a big part of him and he struggles daily to cope with his brother's loss even now.  'David and I were also extremely close so it is not just a TV programme but the implication of what it does to certain people. 'I am a realist. I can turn the tv off and manage my grief, my days, but other family members can't. Did ITV ever consider our feelings? No, not for one minute sadly.' Screenwriter Kevin Sampson who wrote the drama has defended the programme. He said: 'In 2022 violence against women remains rife and is all too often accompanied by a victim-blaming agenda. I hope this drama will go some way to condemning this narrative.' PC David Rathband hanged himself after he was blinded by Moat because he couldn't cope with his new disability and a breakdown in his marriage, a coroner ruled.  Mr Rathband was found at his home in Blyth, Northumberland, in February 2012, after he was shot in the face by crazed gunman Moat in July 2010. The officer had moved out of the marital home in August 2011 after his wife found out he was having an affair with 7/7 London bombing survivor Lisa French.  He became a national hero and used his profile to set up the Blue Lamp Foundation to support 999 staff injured at work. However, the inquest heard Mr Rathband, 44, had made threats to kill himself and told Miss French he had attempted to hang himself but could not go through with it. On the night Mr Rathband took his own life, his estranged wife Kath visited him for the last time. She said she thought he looked 'awful' and decided he needed support. But she felt she was not the right person to be with him and contacted his sister Debbie Essery and his welfare officer. Concluding that Rathband took his own life, Coroner Eric Armstrong said: 'The circumstances of his injuries [inflicted by Moat] are well known. It is difficult, if not impossible, not to view the infliction of those injuries as the first step in a series which culminated in his death. 'Many people may look back, police officers and others, and with the benefit of hindsight, form the view that they wish they could have done something else. Could I implore them not to carry that out? Decisions were taken which at the time seemed appropriate and were justified at the time.'   In a statement read after the hearing by lawyer Philip Davison, Kath thanked family and friends for their 'unwavering' support. She said: 'David fought so hard to come to terms with the devastating injuries that resulted from the shooting and the effect it had on us all as a family. 'Whilst I have lost David, he has left me with two amazing children and he would be immensely proud of them and what they have achieved, as I am.'  Moment Raoul Moat blasted himself in the head with sawn-off shotgun is recreated for ITV drama: Actor is filmed kneeling on the grass with weapon in scenes showing the killer's final hours before he took his own life  By Tom Pyman for MailOnline  The moment crazed gunman Raoul Moat blasted himself in the head with a sawn-off shotgun has been recreated for a new ITV drama. Actor Matt Stokoe, 33, was last night filmed kneeling on the grass with the weapon under his chin in chilling scenes showing the killer's final hours before he took his own life.  Stokoe was seen on his knees, holding a sawn off shotgun to his chin, while armed officers surrounded him, repeatedly asking him to drop his weapon.  The actor was then seen lifting the gun up to the side of his head and pulling the trigger before collapsing on the floor. The scenes, filmed after dark, were eerily similar to the real life ending of the huge manhunt for Moat in 2010.  Spurned former bouncer Moat, 37, had just been released from Durham Prison following an 18-week sentence for assault when he began his vindictive campaign of murder early on July 3 that year - first by killing ex-girlfriend Samantha Stobbart's karate instructor lover Chris Brown, then shooting her in the stomach through a house window in Birtley, Gateshead. He then declared war on police while on the run for murder and attempted murder, and blasted PC David Rathband in the face when he found the officer parked up in a patrol car on a roundabout in Newcastle. Rathband was blinded in the senseless attack and went on to take his own life in February 2012 because he couldn't cope with his disability, a coroner ruled. Moat took refuge with a pair of accomplices in Rothbury, Northumberland, but his actions triggered one of the nation's most notorious manhunts. Armed police were drafted in from around the country, survival expert Ray Mears was brought in to advise on where Moat could be fleeing, and RAF jets with heat-seeking cameras were deployed to canvas the north east of England in search for the killer. The thug was eventually cornered by armed police before a six-hour stand-off began - during which footballer Paul Gascoigne famously turned up at the site of the police stand-off with a fishing rod and chicken dinner to try and talk 'Moaty' round. As negotiators tried to get Moat to put down his weapon, the crazed killer shot himself in the head. Stokoe, famous for roles in the Channel 4 series Misfits, the BBC series Bodyguard and Sky's Jamestown, has assumed the lead role of Moat, while Sally Messham (Doc Martin) and Josef Davies (Chernobyl) will play Moat's ex-lover Stobbart and murder victim Brown. The drama will also star The A Word's Lee Ingleby as Northumbria Police Officer Neil Adamson, who was among the main police officers searching for Moat while he evaded capture.  Thursday, July 1, 2010: Released from Durham prison after serving a short time for assault Saturday, July 3, 2010: Moat shoots dead Chris Brown, who is the new partner of his ex girlfriend Samantha Stobbart, who he also tried to shoot twice through the window of a property Sunday, July 4, 2010: Moat shoots PC David Rathband and the public are urged not to approach him Monday, July 5, 2010: Cleveland, Humberside, West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire and Cumbria Police join up with Northumberland Police to help them with the search for Moat Tuesday, July 6, 2010: Moat declares war on the police.

It is not clear if Gascoigne will feature in the show.  The series has been titled 'The Hunt for Raoul Moat', though a release date is yet to be confirmed.  Born in 1973, Moat was bought up by his grandmother in Newcastle's deprived West End - just a few doors down from his parents, Josephine and stepfather Brian Healey. Moat was widely regarded as a man with an explosive temper; a muscle-bound bodybuilder addicted to steroids and anti-depressants who could flip at a moment's notice.  Samantha told Newcastle Crown Court in 2011 after the shooting spree that Moat had a 'Jekyll and Hyde split personality', and was prone towards violent behaviour. At the time of his death Moat had been on the run for a week after being released from Durham prison following an 18-week sentence for assault. Just two days after his release the 37-year-old shot dead Chris Brown and wounded his ex-girlfriend Samantha Stobbart on July 3.  Just hours later he left PC David Rathband blind, he took his own life two years later. Just days before the stand off with police, officers released new images of Moat and urged the public to stay away from him. Pictures were also released by police showing the equipment Moat was using to hide in his woodland lair. On Friday 9 July officers located three of Moat's mobile phones. One, used to make the two 999 calls to police before and after PC David Rathband was shot. Moat was later cornered into a riverbank and had a shot gun to his head. Moat's friend Tony Laidler was escorted into the police cordon and food and water items were also bought in as the stand off continued. Moat's ex-girlfriend Samantha Stobbart told a court in 2011 that the crazed gunman 'had a Jekyll and Hyde split personality' as she told of the horrifying moment the killer attacked her and her lover.  Moat had just shot her karate instructor boyfriend Chris Brown in the neck and chest before 'calmly executing' him with a final shot to the head, a trial heard. Miss Stobbart wept as she told a jury at Newcastle Crown Court how Moat 'just appeared' and started shooting on July 3 last year.  She said the killer had a 'Jekyll and Hyde split personality' and could be violent and unpredictable.  Miss Stobbart said: 'Chris went down to the grass and I followed him. I remember Raoul was shouting. I don't know what. Shouting. He pointed the gun at my legs and I ran into the house.  'I could not see anybody. I was panicking because my daughter was upstairs and I was running about the house looking for the keys and I did not know what they looked like. 'I heard two shots. When I looked out the window it was done. I didn't see Raoul come towards the house, I was concentrating on Chris. I just heard shouting and before I knew it I got shot.'  In the early hours of Saturday morning a gunshot was heard, Moat shot himself and no shots were fired by police. He was taken to hospital for treatment but died just hours later. In a bizarre twist to the police stand-off with the killer in Rothbury, which was widely reported at the time, former England footballer Paul Gascoigne showed up to try to talk Moat down. Speaking in the years following the manhunt, Gascoigne told the Mirror: 'I thought that I could take Raoul Moat fishing because he was near a river. I told the taxi driver 'head for the airport' and then when we got to Newcastle airport I said 'head for Rothbury'. 'The taxi driver said 'you are not going where I think you are going?' And I said 'yes I am'.' He said he went on to tell the taxi driver that he could 'save Moat' because he had been through so much himself during his struggles with addiction and alcoholism.  When Gascoigne got out of the taxi he said he headed straight for the field where Moat was surrounded by police. He asked police 'where's Moaty', and one officer asked if he knew him personally, to which Gascoigne denied. He said rumours then started to circulate as to how he knew Moat with some saying they had been friends. They had never met, but as the situation around Moat intensified, Gascoigne found himself on TV screens and linked with the chain of events ever since. In the years since, several members of Moat's family have expressed the pain they still feel as a result of their son's actions and the abuse they are subject to. Moat's ex-girlfriend Samantha was rushed to Queen Elizabeth hospital in Gateshead, where she was left fighting for her life, after she was shot. On July 5, Samantha was declared to no longer be in a critical condition following the attack, and left hospital on July 17.  That same day she issued a direct appeal to Moat, who had gone on the run, and said: 'Please give yourself up. If you still loved me and our baby you would not be doing this.' Miss Stobbart told a court in 2011 that the crazed gunman 'had a Jekyll and Hyde split personality' as she told of the horrifying moment the killer attacked her and her lover.  Moat had just shot her karate instructor boyfriend Chris Brown in the neck and chest before 'calmly executing' him with a final shot to the head, a trial heard. Miss Stobbart wept as she told a jury at Newcastle Crown Court how Moat 'just appeared' and started shooting on July 3 last year. 'Chris went down to the grass and I followed him.

  "89515f3081e460c3a6f08f14d0f3de714499acf8e05740f1282d0fc9": "A smiling Queen stood unaided today as she held a face-to-face audience with the president of Switzerland at Windsor Castle. The monarch, who returned from a week-long break at her Sandringham estate yesterday, smiled broadly as she posed for photographs with Ignazio Cassis and his wife Paola in her Oak Room sitting room this morning. The Queen stood without her walking stick and was dressed in a blue and grey paisley-style patterned silk dress. She was wearing her fruit-themed sapphire and diamond grapes brooch, which features a sapphire bow and 16 small diamonds shaped like a bunch of grapes. It was inherited from the Queen Mother.  She flew back to her Berkshire castle in a Sikorsky S-76C helicopter with The Queen's Helicopter Flight team from the Royal Household, after spending time away at her Norfolk retreat where she celebrated turning 96 last Thursday. Yesterday, the Queen was photographed being driven away from Wood Farm - a cottage nestled in the far reaches of the country estate - in a Range Rover at around 11.30am before getting into the helicopter. She was spotted in the back seat of the car as she was chauffeur-driven away from the five-bedroom farmhouse which was the home in retirement of her late husband Prince Philip, who died in April last year.  The Queen has told how the Duke of Edinburgh 'loved' the cottage and part of its attraction was because the 'sea was so close'. The monarch arrived in Sandringham last week to spend her 96th birthday privately, and over the last few days she has been seen visiting her stables on the estate with her racing manager John Warren.  There were no public engagements for her birthday, but there will be celebrations for her official birthday and Platinum Jubilee in June. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said she is hoping to attend the State Opening of Parliament in less than two weeks' time, on May 10, but confirmation is expected closer to the time or on the day. The Queen, who has experienced mobility issues in recent months, has opened Parliament on all but two occasions during her reign. The exceptions were in 1959 and 1963, when she was pregnant with Prince Andrew and then Prince Edward, when her speech was read by the Lord Chancellor. In just over a month's time, the Platinum Jubilee bank holiday weekend will get under way, celebrating the nation's longest reigning head of state's 70 years on the throne. Festivities include Trooping the Colour, beacon lighting, a service of thanksgiving, the Epsom Derby, a pop concert at Buckingham Palace, and a spectacular Jubilee Pageant on the streets of London. It has not yet been confirmed how many of the high-profile events the Queen will be able to attend. On Wednesday evening, her second son, the disgraced Duke of York, was stripped of his Freedom of York by councillors in the city, amid further calls for him to have his dukedom removed.  It comes amid reports that the Queen may travel to Trooping the Colour by Range Rover instead of a royal carriage for the first time in her 70-year reign to boost her comfort after suffering from mobility issues. The monarch may make the journey from Buckingham Palace to Horse Guards Parade by 4x4 as part of several contingency plans being drawn up by officials ahead of the Platinum Jubilee weekend. During her reign, the Queen's attendance at most engagements has been planned for months and often announced publicly weeks in advance. But the presence of the monarch will now be a bonus, rather than guaranteed and 'will be decided on the day' due to mobility issues. Buckingham Palace distanced itself from the suggestion that the Queen would watch Trooping the Colour from the Major-General's office overlooking the parade ground rather than inspecting the troops on a dais, The Telegraph reported. A royal insider said: 'I cannot imagine in 100 years that if attending, Her Majesty wouldn't be seated on a dais in Horse Guards Parade. 'All the plans are fluid at the moment and nothing has been finalised.' The Queen's most recent public appearance came on March 29 at the thanksgiving service for her late husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, at Westminster Abbey. But over the past six months she has withdrawn from several other events historically central to her diary, including the Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph and the annual Commonwealth Service. Aides are hopeful the Queen will be able to attend some of the events organised to mark her 70th jubilee in person, although it is expected these will be few in number. The Household Cavalry is said to have been informed of alternative options in light of her mobility problems. The 4x4 proposal would see four mounted divisions escort the Queen's vehicle up The Mall on June 2, with other Royals sticking to the tradition of travelling by carriage. Prince Charles, Prince William and Princess Anne are expected to take part in the parade on horsebacks as part of their roles as 'Royal Colonels'. Another royal source told the Telegraph that the reason for the plan was 'both speed and comfort' as it is no longer comfortable for the Queen to 'travel by carriage or to be standing on a dais for an extended period'. Typically, the Queen is joined by her children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, as well as more distant relatives like her niece, nephew and cousins. She has extended the invitation to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who she saw together for the first time in more than two years when they stopped off at Windsor Castle last week on their way to the Netherlands for the Invictus Games. Harry, 37, and Meghan, 40, would attend in an informal role, following their decision to step down as working members of the Royal Family. Buckingham Palace is said to have promised the Sussexes full armed security at all Royal Family events in June in a bid to reassure them after Harry said he felt 'unsafe' in Britain.",
  "a85277f84ecd0c6f6f667b2a3c50b53dd07096228f476c29605ef520": "A frail and elderly mother was left screaming in pain as she waited 10 hours for an ambulance as the appalling wait times for emergency care continue to be laid bare. Stuart Donald was alerted by his mother's care provider at North Lincolnshire Council that she had pushed the emergency button on her lifeline alarm that she wears around her neck after being unable to get out of bed. The care provider contacted Mr Donald at 7am that morning, who told carers his 'frail' mother required an ambulance.  He dialled 111, who told him his mother required emergency care. Two hours later, Mr Donald was contacted by the East Midlands Ambulance service who promised to send an ambulance 'within six hours'. His elderly mother's realised she couldn't put any pressure on her legs without experiencing severe pain, but without the prospect of any medical assistance arriving her son drove 20 miles to go and help her. Arriving at her Scunthorpe home, Mr Donald called for a family member to help him move his mother, but they failed so he again called for an ambulance six hours later. 'I said: 'My mother is sat in absolute agony and we physically can't move her, we need help - you must have capacity', and he said, 'No, not at the moment, but as soon as someone becomes available we'll send someone'.  After upgrading the incident to a 'Category Two' response six hours later, medics should have arrived at the property within 18 minutes.  Despite this, it took the ambulance service 10 hours to finally arrive. They have since apologised for the incident and explained they must 'prioritise the sickest and most severely injured patients first'. Mr Donald slammed the service for 'failing to protect the public' after his mother's ordeal. After first realising she was unable to get out of bed without screaming in pain, Mr Donald's mother pushed her alarm button at 7am on Sunday, April 24. North Lincolnshire Council, her care provider, initially contacted Mr Donald's brother, who was in intensive care, but reached him who told them his mother required an ambulance. After trying to move her himself, he explained: 'She said she couldn't stand up and that she'd been stuck there and she daren't move sideways because she couldn't put weight on her legs, and she was scared she'd fall off the bed. 'I couldn't move her so I rang another family member to help move her, but we couldn't.  'We tried to lift her up and she just screamed in pain. We knew then it was an emergency because we had a frail old lady who had been sat on the edge of the bed for six hours, shaking and shivering.  'It was awful. I rang back and spoke to a very professional lady who said they recognised they hadn't got to my mum but that it had been upgraded to a Category Two incident'. According to the East Midlands Ambulance Service website, Category two incidents are classed as an emergency and should be responded to within 18 minutes  Elsewhere, patients have shared their stories of agonising waits for ambulances as NHS England last month admitted it is struggling to cope with a surge in demand and high staff absence rates. It comes as dozens of others across the country have reported 'horrendous' waiting times, with the Liberal Democrats describing the ambulance services as being at 'breaking point'.  The ambulance crew eventually arrived at 7.10pm - around ten hours after Mr Donald first called the ambulance for his mother. He said: 'They were brilliant with my mum, I can't fault them at all.  'They did checks and said she needed to go to hospital because she's clearly not right, and she needed hospital care. They took her in an ambulance at about 7.50pm. 'But they're playing a gambling game.  'There cannot be adequate cover if it takes nine-plus hours for an emergency response. What would have happened if my mum had deteriorated? 'She was screaming in pain and I was crying because I couldn't lift her. I was so frustrated because I just didn't know what else I could do.'   Sue Cousland, Divisional Director for Lincolnshire at East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) said: 'We are really sorry that we were not able to get to her sooner and this is not the level of service we aim to provide for our patients. 'Unfortunately, we continue to experience a sustained level of life-threatening and serious emergency calls and we continually work to prioritise the sickest and most severely injured patients first. 'We are working very closely with all of our health and social care partners to improve the response to patients in Lincolnshire.' More than a quarter of patients arriving by ambulance at hospitals in England in March waited at least 30 minutes to be handed over to A&E departments - the highest level since the start of winter, new figures show. Some 21,051 delays of half an hour or longer were recorded across all hospital trusts in the seven days to March 27. This was 26% of the 79,588 arrivals by ambulance. The proportion of handovers delayed by at least 30 minutes has been rising in recent weeks, having stood at 20% in mid-February. Figures for ambulance delays are published by NHS England and the current data runs from the start of December 2021. There were 9,225 arrivals last week - 12% of the total - who were kept waiting more than an hour to be handed to A&E teams, up from 10% in the previous week. Analysis of the data shows that Northern Lincolnshire & Goole NHS Foundation Trust reported the highest proportion of handovers delayed by at least 30 minutes last month (74%), followed by Gloucestershire Hospitals (71%), University Hospitals Plymouth (71%) and University Hospitals Bristol & Weston (68%). University Hospitals Plymouth topped the list for handovers delayed by more than an hour (58%), followed by Northern Lincolnshire & Goole (57%), Gloucestershire Hospitals (54%) and University Hospitals Bristol & Weston (52%). A handover delay does not always mean a patient has waited in the ambulance. They may have been moved into an A&E department but staff were not available to complete the handover. The figures are another sign of the pressures hospitals are facing amid the latest rise in coronavirus infections. Separate data published on Thursday showed staff absences at NHS hospitals in England due to Covid-19 have jumped to their highest level since the end of January, with numbers climbing in all regions. Absences averaged 27,571 a day last week - the equivalent of 3% of the workforce - up from 23,127 the previous week, though still some way below the 45,736 (5% of the workforce) reached in early January. Responding to the figures, NHS national medical director Professor Stephen Powis said: 'NHS staff remain under pressure as they deal with high numbers of patients in hospital alongside a spike in staff absences due to Covid-19 - with numbers of staff off sick due to Covid almost doubling in the last three weeks. 'Yet NHS staff are working hard to deliver as much routine care as possible, as well as rolling out the NHS spring booster programme, so if you have a health concern, please come forward for the care you need.' A total of 15,632 people were in hospital in England with Covid-19 as of March 30, up 18% week on week and the highest since January 19, NHS England said. Patient numbers are nearing the peak reached in early January - 17,120 - but remain well below the 34,336 at the peak of the second wave of the virus at the start of 2021.",
  "a5c56775c1f0833ece6de3a0e167bdc7d7f68a1fe4b5e49e0f3ff3f8": "The Queen will 'certainly not' take Prince Andrew's Duke of York title off him - after councillors in the city voted to strip him of the honour. Her Majesty, 96, will not remove the title that she gave him over 30 years ago in 1986, Royal sources have claimed. It came after councillors have voted to strip the Duke of York of his freedom of that city and called for him to have his dukedom removed.  The prince was branded 'an utter disgrace' during the extraordinary meeting to debate his Freedom of the City honour, which was awarded to him in 1987. After discussing the motion for around half an hour, councillors unanimously voted to strip him of the title. His continued clinging to the title Duke of York was described as as 'stain' on the city and councillors are now calling on the Queen, Palace or government to step in and strip him of the title if he refuses 'to do the right thing' and resign. The council also noted objections from the public calling for the prince be banned from attending horse racing events in the city. Another said he should be referred to as 'Andrew Windsor' in the future.  A source told the Mirror: 'The Queen certainly will not take any further action in that regard. 'The Duke of York has stepped back from public life and already had a range of titles and associations removed and Her Majesty's position has not deviated from that.' Andrew had been warned in advance that he would be losing the freedom of the city, an honour bestowed on him on February 23, 1987, as a wedding gift to Sarah Ferguson. He is the first person ever to have the Freedom of the City removed, councillors were told. There were two formal abstentions - from the Lord Mayor and Lord Mayor elect. Lib Dem Darryl Smalley, City of York Council's executive member for culture, leisure & communities proposed the motion and says he should also now lose the Duke of York title. He said last night: 'The Honorary Freedom of York is the highest honour we, as a city, can bestow on those who represent the very best of York. The honour is held by many notable and accomplished people who carry it with pride and responsibly. 'Having been stripped of his military roles and royal patronages by the Queen, we believe that it is right to remove all links that Prince Andrew still has with our great city. 'I was pleased to see councillors of all parties support this motion and make it clear that it is no longer appropriate for Prince Andrew to represent York and its residents. 'The removal of this honorary title sends the right message that we as a city stand with victims of abuse. The next logical step is now for Prince Andrew to do the right thing and relinquish his Duke of York title. 'If he fails to do so, the Government and Buckingham Palace must step in to remove his title to finally end Prince Andrew's connection to York.' It follows a slew of authorities, institutions, schools and even golf clubs, which have all sought to distance themselves from the disgraced duke since he settled his civil case with Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking victim Virginia Giuffre.  In the wake of the case, which was settled in February, the 62-year-old was also stripped of his military roles and royal patronages and was told he would no longer be known as 'His Royal Highness'.  Both Buckingham Palace and a spokesperson for the Duke of York declined to comment. York City Council considered the motion: 'The Council resolves that, pursuant to Section 249 of the Local Government Act 1972, the City of York Council withdraws the Honorary Freeman of the City status from the Duke of York which was conferred upon him in 1987.'  The meeting at York Race Course started with an impassioned plea from York resident Gwen Swinburn, who is well known for her clashes with the council. She said: 'This motion could not have been any weaker. Mr Andrew Windsor is an utter disgrace. He brings shame and reputational damage everywhere he goes including to our city. 'The motion to withdraw his status goes nowhere near far enough. He needs to be declared persona non grata in York.' 'As we all know, he loves his horse racing so please agree to write to the race course asking he never be invited here,' she continued. 'That man casts a long shadow and our Queen has removed almost all titles and a responsibilities except his dukedom which stains this city. We need to do more than the easy bit, which is to remove his freedom.' Councillor Aisling Musson, for York Labour Group, added: 'This title damages the reputation of our city. We owe it to the people of York, in particular those affected by sexual violence, abuse or human trafficking. 'Our first duty is not to our reputation but their well-being and protection and remove this stain of association on our city which I am sure has weighed heavily on their minds - and may even have brought up pain and trauma they have worked hard to move past from.' Councillor Mark Warters added: 'While it is purely a symbolic act it does send a very strong signal from this city.' Councillor Martin Rolley, for the Tory Group, is also calling for a new watchdog awards sub committee to be set up to vet future suggestions for Freeman. York has a long history of freemen dating back to 1272. Freemen can claim their rights through patronage as far back as their great-great-grandparent. Once they are sworn in, freemen can join the Gild of Freemen who take an interest in the affairs of the city. New admissions are made every year. Back then, freemen were given control of city trade, city strays and rights of pasture. They were also given roles in running the city.  However, in modern times, they have no privileges in the city. You can still claim Freemanship through 'hereditary right' but it is also now possible to just apply for the tile by filling out an application form.   He added: 'I would like to challenge the council. The title dates back many many years. 'We want to ensure nobody receives a freedom of the city award as a result of a right of birth or standing in their community other than earned in the community.' Councillor Dave Taylor added: 'The motion has been very carefully worded to avoid any lurid allegations which would be difficult if not impossible to substantiate. 'However, I subscribe to the point of view that the Duke of York has shown a dreadful lack of judgment in his friendships with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. 'I hope in the future the Monarch might appoint the Princess Beatrice to be Duchess of York. In contrast to his father, she is personable, intelligent and does her homework and reads her briefing paper when visiting the city of York.' Councillor Denise Craghill, for the Green Group, said: 'It is highly inappropriate Andrew should retain the freedom of the city. 'It is highly inconsistent what we stand for as a city and would like the Palace and Government to take action to remove his title as Duke of York.' The Duke is the first VIP to be stripped of his Freeman status since Jimmy Savile, who had his taken by Scarborough Council in 2011.  The meeting in York had been scheduled to take place virtually last month but the plug was pulled just two hours before it was due to start following objections from Labour councillors.  The decision to cancel the initial meeting caused fury among councillors, but York Council's Lib Dem Group said the vote would go ahead on the same motion in April.  The spokesman said: 'The votes taken remotely would have been seen as recommendations and would have had to go to the Chief Operating Officer to be confirmed as decisions. 'Virtual meetings took place during Covid when the COO agreed with all the recommendations. It is purely because the agenda item on this meeting was very, very political. 'It was felt it would be better to hold it safely and properly in person once members were ready and healthy enough to attend. 'Quite a few councillors had recently tested positive for Covid and the real concern was many of them were vulnerable.'  Ahead of the cancelled meeting last month, Darryl Smalley, a Liberal Democrat councillor for York City, told the Independent: 'York's unique connection to the crown and the monarch is an important part of our city's legacy and history.   'However, as a council and city, we stand with victims of sexual abuse and are doing all we can to end violence against women and girls locally.  'As such, it is inappropriate that Prince Andrew retains his ambassadorial title that is intrinsically linked to our city.'  Mr Smalley had previously called on Prince Andrew to be stripped of his title. A survey by York's daily newspaper The Press found that 88 per cent of its readers want to see the prince's Duke of York honours taken away from him.   Phil Pinder, a retailer in the famous cathedral city told The York Press in February: 'York deserves better. He has been stripped of his royal duties; he has done a settlement out of court ending the prospect of any kind of legal clearing of his name so the only option is for him to permanently step down as the Duke of York as well. 'York deserves another royal to represent it instead.' He suggested the 'controversial' choice of Prince Harry, who lives in the US and holds the Duke of Sussex title.  There are also multiple petitions to remove the Duke of York honour from Prince Andrew.  One with 1,500 signatories says: 'Not only has 'Prince' Andrew demonstrated a lack of morals, lack of humanity and lack of judgement by protracted fraternising with Jeffrey Epstein, his recent interview confirms he lacks the ability to reflect, show insight and learn.  'Most importantly, it reveals a total lack of caring for others. 'These are not Yorkshire values. Having him associated with such a proud, fair and straight talking county is contradictory and embarrassing. Remove the title.'  Prince Andrew made his first public appearance since he withdrew from public life following his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was found guilty in 2021 of child sex trafficking, at the service for his father Prince Philip. The shamed royal insisted on accompanying the Queen from Windsor Castle to the thanksgiving event at Westminster Abbey. But to the shock of many in the congregation he then escorted his mother all the way to her front-row position - in full view of the live broadcast cameras. It had been expected that the Dean of Westminster would take the Queen to her seat, with Andrew behind. It was claimed the Queen 'personally paid PS2m to Virginia Roberts's charity' as part of Andrew's PS12m settlement. 'Stipulation of Dismissal' documents were filed with a court on March 8, with lawyers on both sides calling for the legal action to be dismissed, indicating the settlement has been paid. As the order was published, the Treasury confirmed no taxpayer funds were used for either the payment to Virginia Roberts or for the Duke of York's legal fees. A freedom of information request asked whether any money from the Sovereign Grant to the Royal Family or any other government money was used. The Treasury insisted: 'No public money has been used to pay legal or settlement fees.' The joint order filed with the New York court said each party would pay their own costs and fees.  There were reports the Queen or even Prince Charles contributed to the settlement by paying it or loaning him the money until the sale goes through of a PS17million Swiss ski chalet he owns with ex-wife, Sarah, Duchess of York. Mrs Roberts had sued Andrew for alleged sexual abuse. She claimed he had sex with her when she was 17 after he was trafficked by his friend, the late billionaire paedophile Epstein. The duke will make a 'substantial donation' to a charity for sex abuse victims set up by Mrs Roberts, now a 38-year-old mother-of-three. He said he now regrets his association with Epstein. Andrew, who was forced to step down from royal duties and public life as a result of the scandal, previously claimed he had no recollection of meeting Mrs Roberts and has always strongly denied her allegations. He agreed to the settlement in February.   A slew of authorities, institutions, schools and even golf clubs, have all sought to distance themselves from the disgraced duke since he settled his civil case with Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking victim Virginia Roberts.  In the wake of the case, which was settled in February, the 62-year-old was also stripped of his military roles and royal patronages and was told he would no longer be known as 'His Royal Highness'.

The Newcastle United and former England hotshot's PS230,000 supercar was spotted by traffic wardens on a double yellow line. The 30-year-old striker had left his flash Urus motor on double yellow lines in the upmarket Jesmond suburb of the city. The parking warden was seen looking at the registration of the sporty SUV - which has a 0-60 of 3.6 seconds. He then issued a ticket and put it on the windscreen of Wilson's 190mph car. The forward - out with a calf injury since December - had left his motor near shops and cafes just a mile from St James' Park. The warden gave him the ticket at 2:40pm last Tuesday afternoon. It's believed the ticket would cost upto PS70 with a discount if paid within a fortnight. An onlooker said: 'I was just walking down Acorn Road in Jesmond, near Newcastle and I saw the traffic warden looking at the car. 'I instantly knew this was Callum Wilson's car as it's very distinctive and I have seen him in this car a number of times. 'I just observed the warden giving the car the ticket. And Wilson didn't come back for at least 20 minutes when I was there. It's not like he was dashing into a shop for 30 seconds - he left his car on a double yellow line where there are regular wardens. Wilson signed for the Magpies in December 2020 for a fee of PS20million from Bournemouth. He has been capped four times by the Three Lions scoring one goal. Newcastle United has been approached for comment.",
  "78670a68e67c88710f1e25fa3dcc8a9dc3bc5e268d6d70b88fb56b6c": "A Samsung advert featuring a woman jogging alone at night in London, with headphones on, has been branded 'tone deaf' by viewers. Critics - who claim 'women wouldn't feel safe doing that' - said the one-minute ad plugging the Galaxy Watch 4, Galaxy Buds 2 and the Galaxy SS2 phone was 'naive' and 'insulting'. The commercial - called Night Owls - sees a sporty woman checking her watch at 2am, before putting in earbuds and heading out into the dark for a night-time jog in the British capital.  Some people on Twitter felt that the advert was unrealistic, claiming women would never feel safe enough to go job by themselves at all hours of the night, with earbuds on.   In a statement, Samsung told Femail the campaign aimed to celebrate individuality and that it was never meant to be insensitive to 'ongoing conversations around women's safety.'  In the advert, the woman wakes up at 2am, and decides to go for a job around the streets of London.   She can be seen running down a dark, empty, street as a large owl watches over her, before passing a skateboarder, some clubbers, a ballerina, a security guard, a construction worker and a hoard of other night-time runners. She then chats with a man on a bike on a deserted bridge. Throughout the jog she checks her progress with a Samsung smartwatch as a voiceover says: 'Sleep at night. Run faster. Push harder.  'Follow the herd. Not for me. I run on a different schedule: mine.'  But customers suggested how unrealistic and dangerous it would be for a woman to go running through a city at night, wearing earphones. 'Every time it comes on, I find myself saying 'No woman would ever do that',' one said. 'She definitely wouldn't be smiling about it, or smiling at random strangers on her own, in the dark,' they added. 'The writers of that ad have clearly never even met a woman.' 'My daughter's first comment 'Can't you just tell a man came up with this advert',' another wrote.  'I'm so staggered by it. It's just so tone deaf, especially with everything that's happened lately,' one said.  'Don't get me wrong, I'd love to live in a world where a woman can go running at 2am. But we ain't there,' one regretted.  'What's she doing engaging with the cyclist on a deserted bridge in the middle of the night? So many issues with this advert,' another said. Someone else wrote: 'With everything that has happened with regards to women's safety - I feel this advert is in poor taste.' And one man - called George - wrote: 'I'm a 6'6 18 stone man living in a relatively safe area and I wouldn't bloody run at 2am with headphones in.' It comes after the Government plugged PS5million into protecting women's safety at night last year amid a terrifying spate of drink spiking incidents and the harrowing murders of Sarah Everard and Sabina Nessa. Both young women were attacked and murdered while walking alone at night.  And recent data shows four out of five women felt unsafe walking alone after dark in a park or other open space, while one in two women felt unsafe walking alone after dark in a quiet street near their home. In a statement, Samsung told Femail: 'The 'Night Owls' campaign was designed with a positive message in mind: to celebrate individuality and freedom to exercise at all hours. 'It was never our intention to be insensitive to ongoing conversations around women's safety.  'As a global company with a diverse workforce, we apologise for how this may have been received,' it went on. ",
  "e12c9a0642292ec0b3fd3d350a00f0f22e2208cab59101ce0a22cccd": "Boris Johnson slapped down the Commons Speaker yesterday over his extraordinary bid to summon the editor of The Mail on Sunday for a lecture. Downing Street issued a thinly veiled rebuke to Sir Lindsay Hoyle after he demanded that David Dillon attend a meeting in Parliament to explain a controversial article about Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner. Mr Dillon turned down the meeting, saying that while he had the 'greatest possible respect' for Parliament, Britain's free Press would not endure 'if journalists have to take instruction from officials of the House of Commons, however august they may be'. Sir Lindsay appeared to be in retreat on the issue last night, with aides saying he had no intention of saying more on the matter. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said that Mr Johnson was 'uncomfortable' with the idea of politicians summoning journalists to explain their stories. He said the PM would not want 'any perception of politicians seeking to in any way curb or control what a free Press seeks to report'. He added: 'We have a free Press in this country and reporters must be free to report what they are told as they see fit.' Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab backed Mr Dillon's decision to boycott the meeting. Mr Raab said it was 'legitimate' for the Speaker to take an interest in coverage of MPs but added: 'It's the prerogative of any editor to decide how they treat that invitation.' Sir Iain Duncan Smith also questioned the Speaker's conduct, saying that Parliament 'should not interfere' with the contents of newspapers. The former Conservative leader told the Daily Mail: 'I'm not sure what on earth the Speaker thought he was going to achieve and I am glad he's seen sense. As a general rule Parliament should not interfere in editorial matters.' A former minister added: 'It's just insane. The Speaker... shouldn't be policing accuracy or offensive opinions. 'It's bonkers - what the hell is he thinking? I haven't found anyone who thinks he has handled this well.' The row began when The Mail on Sunday reported that a Tory MP had heard Mrs Rayner telling a group of around eight MPs on the Commons terrace that she liked to put the Prime Minister 'off his stride' by crossing and uncrossing her legs while sitting opposite him in the Commons. Labour's deputy leader categorically denied the claims, which she described as 'desperate, perverted smears'. But since then, three further MPs - including a woman - have come forward to say that they were present on the terrace and that they heard Mrs Rayner herself joke about her 'tactic'. In total, four MPs have all given the same account of what she said, including the use of a startling slang colloquialism. The Daily Mail also revealed yesterday that Mrs Rayner laughed and joked about a comparison to Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct at a comedy event earlier this year. In a light-hearted interview with comedian Matt Forde in January, she volunteered the fact that an appearance at Prime Minister's Questions had drawn such comparisons, joking that it had sparked an internet meme of her crossing and uncrossing her legs. She told his Political Party podcast: 'I wasn't aware I did it but apparently there was this whole meme about how my dress was a bit revealing, but I didn't think it was.' Mr Forde asked if the suggestion was that she was trying to distract the Prime Minister. Mrs Rayner, who said she had been 'mortified' by the meme, laughed and replied: 'It don't take much does it? I don't need to do that.' Mrs Rayner yesterday insisted that the fact she had tried to 'brush aside' the sexism she faces 'doesn't make it OK'. She rejected the idea that she 'enjoys being subjected to sexist slurs', adding: 'I don't. They are mortifying and deeply hurtful.' In a letter to the Speaker on Tuesday night, Mr Dillon said he and The Mail on Sunday's political editor would no longer be attending the meeting with him after he had 'regrettably' commented on the story in public. In a statement on Monday, Sir Lindsay told MPs that he 'shares the views' of many MPs that the story about Mrs Rayner was 'misogynistic and offensive'. Mr Dillon said he had judged the article 'without being in possession of the facts surrounding how it came to be reported'. A spokesman for Sir Lindsay said yesterday that he would not be making any comment on The Mail on Sunday's response. In a statement on Tuesday, he insisted he was a 'staunch believer and protector of Press freedom', saying he had refused a request from a Labour MP last week to ban The Times's sketch writer for making allegedly 'sexist' observations. He added: 'I firmly believe in the duty of reporters to cover Parliament, but I would also make a plea - nothing more - for the feelings of all MPs and their families to be considered, and the impact on their safety, when articles are written. 'I would just ask that we are all a little kinder. That is what I wanted to talk about.'",
  "0fba33e688f73d4aa3af86310a48095ade08adf650ad343d634a3587": "Boris Johnson has summoned Passport Office bosses to Downing Street to explain the renewal chaos which has seen 700,000 outstanding applications still to clear amid fears over a summer of cancelled holidays. The Prime Minister is said to be 'horrified' at the backlog - but the Home Office insisted today that the agency's PS160,000-a-year director-general working from home at her village property in Leicestershire, 100 miles away from its London headquarters, has 'precisely zero bearing on the current situation with passports'. Abi Tierney, 48, who was appointed as director-general in early 2020 when the pandemic began and lives with her two young sons, is battling to control the chaos as customer services teams continue to work from home. Home Office sources said Dr Tierney, who is responsible for leading 3,500 Passport Office staff, spends most of her time working at its centres around Britain - including in London, where the headquarters is located in Victoria. And Home Office Permanent Secretary Matthew Rycroft said claims that she is under pressure to return to HQ full-time 'totally ignores reality'. He praised her for being 'a hugely talented leader', adding: 'With sites spread across the UK, Abi works day-in, day-out with teams around the country delivering vital services for the British public.'  However the Daily Telegraph claimed today that a resident of the Leicestershire village where Dr Tierney lives said she appeared to be based there, 107 miles from London. Conservative former minister David Jones told MailOnline today that the claim 'underlines the importance of civil servants getting back to the office environment', adding: 'It beggars belief that any senior official would be staying at home when her office is so clearly in crisis.' And Tory MP Henry Smith told MailOnline that there had been 'notable deterioration in services' among government agencies, such as the Passport Office, as officials were slow to return to their offices.  But the Home Office defended Dr Tierney and told MailOnline that it has Passport Offices 'in a range of locations across the UK, with 90 per cent of our staff based outside London', adding: 'It is therefore ludicrous to suggest that any senior leader not living there would impact on their ability to do their job to the highest standards.'  Britons trying to get their passport renewed are furious at being left on hold for hours before being told by customer services staff working from home that they cannot access files to provide an update on applications.  Among them is Mohammad Reza, a dual British-Iranian national, who told the newspaper while queuing at the Passport Office for his son's documents: 'I got through to the customer service after four hours on hold.  'One of them told me they all work from home. That's the reason why customer services have no access to the files. That's the reason why they can't give proper updates. It's shocking. Why are they still at home?' It comes after Mr Johnson delivered an ultimatum to stay-at-home officials as he threatened to 'privatise the a***' off the Passport Office and DVLA amid huge backlogs. The Prime Minister said families deserve better than the 'post-Covid manana culture' that has seen thousands of civil servants refusing to return to the office. Also in recent days, Brexit Opportunities Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg warned civil servants who refuse to return to Whitehall risk losing their plum London jobs. The Conservative MP has been leaving notes on the desks of absent civil servants which read 'sorry you were out when I visited. I look forward to seeing you in the office very soon'. Mr Johnson will summon Dr Tierney for urgent talks at Downing Street next week as the Passport Office struggles to cope with high demand after five million people did not renew their travel documents during the pandemic. Downing Street chief of staff Steve Barclay is expected to meet with Passport Office officials later this week. Dr Tierney lives in a village just over 100 miles away from the London office, which takes about two-and-a-half hours to drive. Direct non-stop trains from Leicester railway station take about one hour to London St Pancras.  The Passport Office is set to deal with 9.5 million applications this year - up from four million applications in 2020 and five million in 2021 when Covid-19 restrictions were in place. Holidaymakers in Britain are now being advised to leave at least ten weeks to get a new passport, but MPs have said this target is being regularly breached.  The Telegraph - which first reported the claims in today's newspaper - also revealed that 300,000 applications are being held up by delays in uploading documents, while a further 400,000 are currently being processed. On Monday, the Commons heard about one woman who had waited more than five months to receive her daughter's new passport, with services branded 'either really very good or an absolute shambles'.  The French-owned company contracted to run the Passport Office's contact centre has been ordered to hire more people to ease 'unacceptable' delays. Teleperformance, the private firm responsible for the office's call handling, has been 'urgently tasked to add additional staff' by the Home Office. The head of the Passport Office, Abi Tierney, will discuss Teleperformance's problems with its chief executive this week, according to The Times.  The company has been heavily criticised by exasperated applicants in recent weeks.  The Home Office has a PS22.8million five-year contract with Teleperformance to provide 'contact centre services' including a 'passport advice service for HM Passport Office'. And the newspaper claimed that Dr Tierney claimed nearly PS4,000 in expenses for 20 trips to London over a 16-month period between March 2020 and July 2021.  But Mr Rycroft told MailOnline of the Telegraph's article: 'This story totally ignores reality. Abi is a hugely talented leader, heading up our world-class visa and passport operations. With sites spread across the UK, Abi works day-in, day-out with teams around the country delivering vital services for the British public. 'Abi's work location has had precisely zero bearing on the current situation with passports, which has largely resulted from a drop in renewals during the pandemic. Our teams are working flat out to meet the demand. 'We are proud to be spreading opportunity and talent across the country, moving away from the outdated notion that everything must be done in London.' Sources within the department said Dr Tierney's role also covers UK Visas & Immigration (UKVI), which also has offices around the country - and that being based in the East Midlands places her closer to the majority of Passport Office and UKVI teams including in Durham, Peterborough, Sheffield, Liverpool and Glasgow. And a Home Office spokesman told MailOnline today: 'We have Passport Offices in a range of locations across the UK, with 90 per cent of our staff based outside London. It is therefore ludicrous to suggest that any senior leader not living there would impact on their ability to do their job to the highest standards. 'As part of the Government's Levelling Up agenda, we are proud that we are spreading opportunities and leadership roles more evenly around the country and we will continue to do this - it is only right that we attract the best talent from across the UK.' Dr Tierney previously worked as business development Director for Serco, a private contractor for various public services, and has a PhD from the University of Oxford.  She has also held operational roles in Serco such as regional director and chief executive of Suffolk Community Services, and was also previously a director at University Hospitals of Leicester and Aberdeen City Council, and worked as a marketing leader for IBM Global Business Services.  BY JAMES ROBINSON FOR MAILONLINE Britons say their holiday plans are being thrown into doubt because of 'nightmare' delays in receiving their new passports. Families say they fear missing out on long-awaited trips because they have not yet received the important travel documents - despite applying for them months ago. One family revealed how they are yet to receive a passport nearly two months after ordering it - even after shelling out an extra PS120 to 'fast track' their application. Meanwhile, a wedding photographer said she faces losing out on a PS3,000 job in France because her passport has not arrived - despite her applying for it back in September.   One family told MailOnline how they face losing out on a PS1,200 holiday to Spain next month because they are still without one of their passports. Ellie Freeman, from Nottinghamshire, said her family are still waiting on one passport in order to travel to the Spanish coastal town of Tossa Del Mar next month. Her and her partner Jordan ordered passports for themselves and their two children, one aged four and the other 9 months old, at the start of March. At the time, the Passport Office recommended a wait time of between three and five weeks - meaning the couple had given themselves plenty of time. They have since received three out of four passports, but are still awaiting the travel document for their youngest child. Desperate to go on holiday, the couple say they shelled out an extra PS100 in order to 'fast track' the passport application with the hope of receiving it within a week. But with the days ticking down to their flight, they are still yet to receive the travel document. Hotel worker Ellie, 26, who also missed out on a trip to Corfu in May last year due to Covid restrictions, said: 'It's been an absolute nightmare. 'And it's the hope that's making it worse. I would rather they just say it won't be here, because we have to make plans. 'I've seen some people getting there's 48 hours before - which is fine if it's a stag weekend abroad, but it's hard if you have children because there is lots of planning involved.' Ellie's partner Jordan, 27, who works in customer services, said the couple face losing all of their money as a result of the passport delays - because it is not covered on travel insurance. 'We've been left in limbo,' he said. 'We've gone without a lot of extras to save up just to go on holiday as a family 'If they had just told us a few weeks ago we might have been able to make changes to our booking but this close to the travel date it is non-refundable. So we are going to lose that PS1,200 if we can't go.' One photographer also told MailOnline how she faced losing PS3,000 worth of business because of the issue. Kerri Cuthbert, who runs a photography business, Rockford Studio, in Devon, said she ordered a new passport in September after her previous passport expired. But she says she is yet to receive the travel document - forcing her to cancel a wedding job in Bordeaux in June. She said: 'It's now nearly May, and I am due to travel in June, and I have now had to inform the bride and groom at very short notice that they will need to look for a plan B.  'It is a huge loss to my already suffering business post-lockdown, of nearly PS3,000, along with the time already spent planning with the client.  'I renewed my passport back in September when it expired. At first they said it might have been lost and I've been toing and froing trying to find out where it is. 'I only received a message three days ago to say it had turned up. This will have a massive impact on me trying to get my business going again after the pandemic.'  Another holiday hopeful also told MailOnline how they now face losing out on PS1,800 due to delays in receiving their passport. Kym Wylnp said she planned to take her daughter and her four-year-old son away to Spain next month. The 62-year-old local authority worker her daughter's passport has been delayed and without the document she is unable to order a passport for her son. 'She needs the passport in order to order he son's passport because she needs ID. We ordered them in January so we thought it would be here by at least April. It's been an absolute nightmare. 'We've been teaching him (my grandson) little bits of Spanish and I've been paying for swimming lessons because there's a waterpark. 'He's only four, so he's had half of his life disrupted by Covid, and this is the last chance to go on a holiday out of school terms. It would be a real shame if he couldn't go.'   Meanwhile the French-owned company contracted to run the Passport Office's contact centre was ordered to hire more people to ease 'unacceptable' delays. Teleperformance, the private firm responsible for the office's call handling, has been 'urgently tasked to add additional staff' by the Home Office. Dr Tierney will discuss Teleperformance's problems with its chief executive this week, according to The Times.  The company has been heavily criticised by exasperated applicants in recent weeks.  The Home Office has a PS22.8million five-year contract with Teleperformance to provide 'contact centre services' including a 'passport advice service for HM Passport Office'. Priti Patel's department is piling the pressure on the Passport Office to avoid a summer of chaos after five million people did not renew their travel documents during the pandemic. Ministers hope the ten-week target for passport applications will not need to be extended further, amid continued warnings of delays and cancelled holidays. Home Office minister Kevin Foster said yesterday that his advice remains unchanged and anyone heading overseas this summer should submit new passport applications and renewals as soon as possible. But he added in the House of Commons: 'We are making a range of efforts - staff are working weekends, incentivised overtime - and certainly we're confident we will not need to change the ten-week target.' MPs heard that HM Passport Office provides an expedited service where an application from the UK has been with them for longer than ten weeks, with Mr Foster confirming 42 applications have been pushed through under this criterion since March 31. A total of 9.5million British passport applications are expected to be dealt with in 2022, with Covid restrictions on travel resulting in just four million applications in 2020 and five million in 2021 by comparison. Labour urged ministers to 'get a grip' rather than float the prospect of privatising HM Passport Office. Mr Foster, responding to an urgent question from shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, said March saw the 'highest total for any month on record, with HM Passport Office completing the processing of over one million applications - 13 per cent higher than the previous record output'. He added that more than 90 per cent of applications were issued within six weeks in the period between January and March, saying: 'My advice to anyone who is looking to go on holiday this summer is exactly what I said the other day, which is to get your application in now.' For Labour, Ms Cooper warned: 'My constituents fear their honeymoon may now be wrecked because their passports haven't arrived, even though they applied in plenty of time. We've had cases of people cancelling jobs, parents trying to get holiday for a sick child waiting since January, huge long delays by the Passport Office and by the contractor TNT. 'The message today on the one-week fast track service says 'System busy, please try again later', and the online premium service has no appointments anywhere in the country. 'So people can't get urgent travel such as to go to funerals or to go to urgent events.' Ms Cooper said the increase in demand was 'totally predictable', adding the Home Office is 'in danger becoming a stay-at-Home-Office'. She questioned if the Government tried to recruit 1,700 staff but only got 500, adding: 'The Prime Minister has said the answer may be to privatise the Passport Office, but why don't Home Office ministers just get a grip instead?' On Tuesday, a senior Government source said Prime Minister Boris Johnson is ready to 'privatise the arse' out of the Passport Office amid fears that families could miss out on their summer holidays due to delays in renewing their documents. Conservative former minister David Jones pressed ministers to pursue privatisation as he told MPs about a Clwyd West constituent who hopes to go on holiday in May but whose passport application is currently stuck in limbo and who is finding it 'almost impossible to speak to any representative of the Passport Office'. Mr Jones said: 'I heard this morning that the Prime Minister has threatened the Passport Office with privatisation. May I suggest to him that he shouldn't shy away from that? If it can be done more efficiently by the private sector, then for goodness sake enlist the private sector.' Mr Foster replied: 'Just to be clear, there is a range of private contractors already involved in the passport process. The bit that isn't undertaken by private contractors is the decision itself.' Conservative chairman of the Transport Committee Huw Merriman warned about the impact of the passport backlog on the economy. He said: 'The year before Covid, the aviation industry contributed PS22billion to the UK economy, PS3.6billion to the Exchequer from air passenger duty, and it's expected to be at 70 per cent demand this summer, so we can't put this at risk for the sake of our economy.' Earlier, Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said the Government is willing to consider changing the controller of passport services, but no decision has yet been taken. On Monday, Mr Johnson said the public deserves a 'cheaper, faster' passport service as he refused to rule out privatisation if it cannot clear the backlog of applications. A senior Government source said the Prime Minister was ready to 'privatise the a**e' out of the Passport Office amid fears families could miss out on their summer holidays due to delays in renewing their documents. And in an interview with TalkTV, Mr Johnson said his sole concern was to 'deliver value and a good service' to the public. 'I am not going to rule anything out. I don't mind whether it is in the public or the private sector,' he said. 'What I want is for it to deliver value for money and help people's costs. If you want to go on holiday with your family it can cost hundreds of pounds to get new passports. You deserve to have a cheaper, faster service.' The Prime Minister is understood to be 'horrified' at the backlog in dealing with passport applications. He is said to be concerned that families wanting to go on summer holidays are under pressure to pay up to PS100 extra per passport for fast-track applications because of delays. A source cautioned that privatisation would not be the starting point, but warned that Downing Street could look to businesses to take over if passport bosses could not meet the 10-week target for standard applications costing PS75.50. In his interview, Mr Johnson acknowledged that he had criticised 'post-Covid, work-from-home, manana culture' at some of the bodies for not adapting after the easing of coronavirus restrictions. As well as the Passport Office, MPs have been raising concerns over significant delays in turning around applications for licences at the DVLA. 'I think that we have a general issue in some of our approach to public services. We all got used to working from home, Zoom calls,' Mr Johnson said. 'I am the custodian of the public purse I have to ask myself whether it is as productive as all that.' In response to the criticism of the Passport Office's handling of the situation, a spokesman for the Passport Office said: 'Since April 2021, we have been advising people to allow up to 10 weeks when applying for their British passport as more than five million people delayed applying due to the pandemic. 'We urge people who need a new passport to apply for one as soon as possible, with the vast majority of all passport applications being dealt with well within 10 weeks. 'To deal with this demand, we have increased staff numbers by 500 since April 2021. This has helped us to handle more applications than ever before, with more than one million passport applications processed in March 2022.'",
  "f94e26eb17da609c821e984e5b11ebec70bebe6723affcbd7282bb9c": "Labour former Cabinet minister Liam Byrne is set to be suspended from the House of Commons after being found to have bullied a staff member during Britain's first Covid lockdown. A parliamentary watchdog found the Birmingham Hodge Hill MP had committed a 'serious breach' of Commons' bullying and harassment rules. They said that Mr Byrne, 51, had been 'abusing his position of power' and 'ostracizing' his employee David Barker, who has agreed to be named, while he worked in the MP's constituency office. This included Mr Byrne 'ceasing personal contact with him for several months and denying him access to his Parliamentary IT account', such as disabling his work emails. It was said that the impact of Mr Byrne's behaviour was 'compounded by the fact' it occurred between March 2020 and the end of July that year, during the first national lockdown. This saw Mr Barker, who had 'undergone a period of ill health', be 'physically separated from work colleagues' and 'uncertain of his future work status'. Mr Barker made seven allegations of bullying against Mr Byrne, but only one was upheld by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Kathryn Stone. She found the MP had 'ostracized' his staff member following a dispute between the pair at the constituency office, which had led Mr Byrne to send Mr Barker home. The commissioner ruled Mr Byrne's behaviour was 'malicious' and 'involved a significant misuse of power' in the context of Mr Barker's ill health and the Covid lockdown. Mr Barker had appealed the Commissioner's decision not to uphold two of his other allegations. But these were rejected by a sub-panel of the Independent Expert Panel, which determines appeals and sanctions in cases where complaints have been brought against MPs of bullying, harassment or sexual misconduct. The sub-panel concluded: 'This case involves a serious breach of the bullying and harassment policy which arose from the respondent abusing his position of power and ostracizing the complainant, who was his employee, by ceasing personal contact with him for several months and denying him access to his Parliamentary IT account. 'The impact of this behaviour was compounded by the fact that it occurred during the first period of lockdown when the complainant was physically separated from work colleagues, uncertain of his future work status and had undergone a period of ill health.' They also said Mr Byrne's decision not to engage with Mr Barker following what he perceived to be acts of misconduct 'was not, as he argued, a reasonable HR strategy'. 'It was bullying,' the sub-panel added. 'He should, as he now accepts, have tackled any alleged misconduct through a proper disciplinary process not by ostracizing the complainant.'  The sub-panel accepted the MP had 'demonstrated genuine remorse'. But they questioned whether he 'fully understood the extent of his wrongdoing as he implied that his lack of understanding of the term 'ostracization' within the bullying and harassment policy, and the complainant's behaviour, somehow excused his actions'. It has been recommended that Mr Byrne be suspended from the Commons for two sitting days. He has also been told to make a written apology to his former staff member, undertake training, and 'take action to address the causes of his behaviour and weaknesses in the management of his office'. Mr Byrne accepted the decision by the sub-panel. In a statement, the MP said he was 'profoundly sorry' for the 'distress' caused by his ostracism of Mr Barker. He added: 'I have apologised in full to the individual concerned. 'I'm incredibly grateful to the panel for recognising the genuine remorse I felt about the impact on the individual concerned, the steps I have already taken to ensure this never happens again along with the work still to do, and for concluding that I did not deliberately act to delay the investigation. 'This has been a valuable lesson for me and one I am determined to learn as me and my team seek to offer the best possible service and voice for the residents of Hodge Hill.' Mr Byrne was first elected as an MP in 2004 and went on to serve in the Cabinet of former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown, including as Chief Secretary to the Treasury. When Labour lost power following the 2010 general election and in the wake of the financial crisis, Mr Byrne was revealed to have left a note for his incoming successor as Chief Secretary, which read: 'I'm afraid there is no money.' Mr Byrne later apologised over the 'offensive' note, which had become the basis of many Conservative attacks on Labour's record in charge of the public finances. Last year, Mr Byrne stood as Labour's candidate for West Midlands Mayor but was beaten by the Tory incumbent Andy Street. In 2008, a leaked 11-page document issued to civil servants revealed Mr Byrne's demands while he worked in government. The document, titled Working with Liam Byrne, even included the minister's food and drink preferences. It read: 'Coffee/Lunch. I'm addicted to coffee.

The Chancellor warned cabinet colleagues to avoid borrowing more to fund public spending as it risked stoking inflation even further. He warned that a 1 percentage point increase on a typical mortgage would result in an extra PS700 for those not on fixed-rate deals. Mr Sunak, who is facing pressure from Tory MPs to ease pressure on people during the cost of living crisis, was quizzed yesterday by Mumsnet about how someone in his position can empathise with hard-up Britons. He cited his grandparents who emigrated to the UK 'with very little', adding: 'Of course now I'm in a fortunate position but I didn't start like that, that's not how my family started.' But he provoked a fresh row after he argued it would be 'silly' to offer families further help with soaring energy bills right now, despite forecasters predicting rises of as much as 40 per cent in October, equating to nearly PS3,000 a year. Mr Sunak also warned oil and gas giants that they face a windfall tax on their profits if they do not increase investment to shore up Britain's energy supplies. The Chancellor seemed to signal an about-turn on Government opposition to a one-off raid on energy firms despite fears it could hit investment and jobs. He said: 'If we don't see that type of investment coming forward and if the companies are not going to make those investments in our country and in our energy security, then of course that's something I would look at.' Mr Sunak warned that 'nothing is ever off the table in these things', despite ministers ruling out a windfall tax last month. Kwasi Kwarteng, the Business Secretary, had warned the move would be 'a tax on jobs, would harm investment and add to the uncertainty in oil markets'. Mr Sunak's warning shot was fired during a discussion with users of the Mumsnet website in which the Chancellor, who has faced controversy over his family's fortune, defended himself against claims he is out of touch. He was cleared yesterday of breaching the ministerial code over his family's financial affairs. The Prime Minister's ethics watchdog found Mr Sunak had not broken rules on conflicts of interest by holding a US green card. Mr Sunak referred himself for investigation after it emerged that his wife, Akshata Murty, held non-domiciled tax status, exempting her from paying UK tax on overseas earnings. Lord Geidt found two instances where Miss Murty's tax status 'could have given rise to a conflict of interest' for the Chancellor. But the adviser on ministerial interests found that, in the first, the issue was properly declared, and in the second, a proposed change for some non-dom individuals did not affect Mr Sunak's wife. In advice to the PM, Lord Geidt wrote: 'I advise that the requirements of the ministerial code have been adhered to by the Chancellor, and that he has been assiduous in meeting his obligations and in engaging with this investigation.' The adviser did not believe Mr Sunak having held a US green card 'would constitute an inherent conflict of interest'. He was also satisfied that there was no conflict of interest over both Mr Sunak's blind investment trust and Miss Murty's reported 0.91 per cent stake in Infosys, an Indian IT firm founded by her billionaire father. Tulip Siddiq, Labour's shadow economic secretary to the Treasury, said: 'How out of touch is this Chancellor? It's time to act.' Meanwhile, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner branded Lord Geidt's report an 'utter whitewash'. Miss Murty, an Indian citizen said to be worth hundreds of millions, earlier this month agreed to pay UK taxes on her worldwide income. The cost of living crisis will have longer-term implications for households and the UK economy, experts have warned, as Britons are cut back on all sorts of spending and are borrowing to make ends meet. The rise in costs is already affecting almost everyone - around nine in 10 adults have reported an increase in their cost of living last month, new official figures show.  Nearly a quarter of people said they were struggling to pay household bills last month, according to the latest survey by the Office for National Statistics. A bigger proportion - two in five - said they found it 'very or somewhat difficult' to afford their energy bills in March - and that's even before the increase in the energy price cap came into force at the start of April. To cope with the rise in the cost of living, large numbers of families are cutting back on spending - both essential and non-essentials - while some are dipping into savings if they have them, and others are taking on debt.  The most common action was spending less on non-essentials, like going out for dinner or clothes, with over half of Brits saying they did that in March. Turning off the heating and cutting back on electricity use was the second most common move by those trying to cut back on spending - 45 per cent of households did so last month. Some 39 per cent also said they had reduced their non-essential car journeys to save on petrol, while a similar percentage shopped around more to find better deals and a third are cutting back on essentials like food. Meanwhile, nearly a quarter of people dipped into their savings, 11 per cent said they were borrowing more than usual and some 7 per cent asked friends and family for help.  Only 12 per cent of people in Britain said they were not not doing anything in response to the cost of living crisis, the survey shows.    Amin Khan, owner of sustainable clothing retailer, PrimaBerry, says he has cut back on memberships and subscriptions to pay for rising energy bills, as he works from home.  'After reading countless articles with tips and tricks about how to save on bills, I started to panic, which led me to write down all my memberships, subscriptions, direct debits and any other bills and see what could I cancel or downgrade.  'After all the reductions, I am now saving around PS200 monthly, which will definitely help me to pay for any gas and electricity increase as I work from home.' He added: 'I forecasted to sell more than what I am selling at the moment but due the circumstances it is understandable why so many small businesses are struggling. Everything is going up in price but I am trying to not raise my own prices up as much as I can.' Natalie Fletcher, owner of Manchester-based micro manufacturer, Mancmade, says she has no disposable income due to rising costs.  '2021 was a challenge financially but 2022 is taking things to a whole new level in terms of soaring energy, food and fuel costs.  'I also provide a mobile clothing alterations and delivery service to my customers, and the cost of fuel has wiped me out. 'I currently don't have any disposable income, as it all seems to be going on the fuel that is used when delivering to customers.  'No way are this Government doing enough about 'levelling up' as they need to be. In fact, they have done nothing to stop the income inequalities that are seemingly set in stone.' Fanny Snaith, a Cheltenham-based certified money coach, says she will have to increase her income significantly - by 15 per cent or more - to absorb price hikes.  She said: 'As a landlord of a house of multiple occupancy, the utility bills are included in the rent.  'It is not possible to simply raise the rent for many different reasons. That means that we need to be able to absorb the huge energy bill rises, plus the other hikes, too. So that is a hit to income. 'I sense a real danger area here, for landlords and tenants alike.' Jack Leslie, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said all of this was already showing up in falls in consumer confidence.   March saw the largest 12-month fall in consumer confidence since the financial crisis, according to their analysis of figures by the OECD.  'Lower consumer demand will be a challenge for lots of businesses,' he said.  He also expects the crisis to have implications for households and the wider UK economy in the longer term.  'If someone uses up their savings this year to cope with their living costs, that obviously means they don't have those savings to use in the future,' he says.  'The same is true with debt but could also be worse for those who struggle to pay back, potentially affecting credit ratings and therefore longer-term borrowing costs.  'From a macroeconomic perspective, when consumer demand falls that leads to a slowdown in the broader economy. We know that recessions, and economic slowdowns more broadly, can last quite a long time.' At the same time, certain rise in costs could prompt more permanent behavioural changes in some parts of the population.  For example, if higher proportions of people are trying to cut back on fuel/energy usage, that could lead to more people walking and cycling for transport or encouraging better home insulation.  'Those factors could have longer-term effects if they persist once energy prices come back down,' Leslie added. Separate research from MetLife, an insurance company, found that one in six people have cut back costs and 57 per cent say they expect to do so soon. People were most likely to consider giving up everyday perks such as eating lunch out (40 per cent), luxury items (37 per cent), holidays and day trips (34 per cent), socialising (32 per cent) and entertainment subscriptions (28 per cent). My husband I are looking to move to a bigger home, as our two children are getting to the age where they don't want to share a bedroom and we need the extra space. After seeing a few places we liked, we went to our current mortgage lender to get an agreement in principle - but we were turned down for the amount we wanted. I've heard that some banks - including ours - are making it harder to get a mortgage because they are taking higher energy bills and taxes into account. Our bills have risen considerably in the last few months as our fixed energy tariff ran out. Could this be why we were rejected, and if so is there anything we can do about it? I also have a few late car finance payments on my record from when I was made redundant about three years ago. I was back in work a few months later, the car is now paid off, and we have always been on time with the mortgage and our other bills. We're worried about approaching too many lenders, and are wondering which ones are likely to accept us. I've seen some lenders online who say they are more 'flexible' when it comes to helping people with imperfect credit history. Is this worth looking into, and what's the catch? The alternative is to put off our move, but with our kids growing up that's not going to be practical for more than a couple of years. Helen Crane of This is Money replies: Getting turned down for a mortgage at the first hurdle is disheartening - especially when you have outgrown your current home and have a pressing need to move. Sadly, you are not alone. Many people applying for a mortgage today might find it a bit more difficult to get accepted than they would have a few months ago. This is for several reasons.  First of all, interest rates are rising. According to Moneyfacts, the average two-year fixed rate - covering all deposit sizes - is currently 2.86 per cent, up from 2.65 per cent in March.  On a PS200,000 mortgage, this would mean paying PS258 more per year if it had been taken out in April compared to March. That might not seem like a lot, but it could tip the scales from being approved for a mortgage and turned down. The situation could be more severe for those for those with big mortgages relative to their income, or whose current fixed deal is cheaper than those on the market today. Additionally, households are being hit by the cost of living crisis which has seen the price of essentials such as gas and electricity, petrol and grocery shopping rocket. Lenders are increasingly taking these higher bills into account when assessing whether borrowers could afford to pay a mortgage. Santander, for example, has already factored increased national insurance, household expenditure and dividend income tax rates into its affordability calculations. Others are expected to do the same. In your case, you are unsure whether the rejection was down to your increased living costs, your previous debts - or something else. You are keen to find out, because approaching too many lenders in search of a mortgage could damage your credit profile and make things worse. As a first port of call, I would advise going back to your lender and asking for further information on why the application was turned down. There is no reason why it should not be able to provide this. Armed with that knowledge, you will then be able to come up with a plan of action for starting a new application that is more likely to be accepted. This could mean looking at a cheaper property, but the problem might also be solved by saving a slightly larger deposit or considering a different lender.  To help you assess your options, I spoke to Elena Todorova, director of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients; Courtney Flockhart, mortgage broker at Henry Dannell; James Briggs, head of personal finance intermediary sales at specialist lender Together; and Adrian Anderson, director at mortgage broker Anderson Harris. Courtney Flockhart says: Each lender will have its own internal credit scoring system, which is different to a credit score on Experian or Equifax.  Somebody who has a 999 score on Experian could easily fail a lenders' credit score tests, especially if they had a small deposit relative to the property's value. There will be tiered 'pass marks' based on both the borrowers' credit history and their ability to pay the mortgage alongside their other financial commitments. These approval thresholds will change depending on the borrowers' income, the size of their deposit and how much they want to borrow.  James Briggs says: We're in the worst cost of living crisis since the 1980s, and sadly there will be many other potential buyers in this same situation. Many banks and mortgage lenders have reviewed how they assess affordability given the current spike in family outgoings on food, fuel bills and taxes, coupled with rising inflation. Some are changing their household expenditure calculations to consider factors such as the size of the family or the number of vehicles they own. These changes have been made to make sure people's monthly payments are affordable.  However, they don't account for people's individual circumstances meaning people who could otherwise afford a mortgage won't meet these broad-brush requirements. There will be a lot of 'computer says no' type responses. Adrian Anderson says: When factoring in affordability for a mortgage most banks use Office for National Statistics data to presume certain household outgoings. As the cost of household outgoings (including utility bills) has increased, according to the ONS - and is expected to continue to increase - most banks have factored this into the affordability calculators.  This may have an impact on some applicants' ability to borrow the amount they are seeking now. Elena Todorova says: It is disappointing to hear that the couple's bank refused to lend without clear explanation.  However, it does not necessarily follow that the decline was down to an assessment on the increased cost of living and adverse credit. It may be purely technical as the case may just fall outside of credit policy - for example, it may be a few thousand pounds short on income multiples, or applying for an incorrect term. Adrian Anderson says: Late payments on a finance agreement can reduce your credit score.  You should obtain a copy of your credit report through one of the credit reference agencies so that you are aware of any negative entries that may go against you. If there is a genuine explanation regarding why there were some late payments on your record for car finance, a mortgage broker may be able to use their relationships with the underwriters at the competitively priced mainstream or high street banks to explain the circumstances.  This could help you avoid using a 'flexible' or 'specialist' bank which may charge a higher rate of interest. Elena Todorova says: Credit history remains on file for a minimum of six years (longer if the commitment is unsatisfied or unpaid).  This could be a reasonable cause for borrowing being declined, but if it was three or more years ago, certain lenders may be prepared to look at the case more sympathetically. Lenders who may consider to lend in this instance range from high-street lenders offering competitive terms, to smaller banks or building societies which could be more expensive but offer flexible underwriting. Elena Todorova says: The mortgage term can be adjusted to suit the couple's plans.  They could potentially take a longer term [these are available up to 40 years] if it eases affordability models and reduces monthly outgoings, as long as it fits with lenders' maximum age limits. It's important to consider different terms and rates and discuss their monthly budget as ultimately, the couple has to be comfortable with the mortgage payments they will pay now, and in the future. Adrian Anderson says: The best way to avoid approaching multiple lenders and give yourself the best possible chance of securing the mortgage you are seeking is to speak to an independent expert.  They will have the knowledge of how to navigate you through the banks, hopefully meaning fewer failed applications and marks on your credit file.  James Briggs says: Specialist lenders differ to traditional banks as they can make more pragmatic individual lending decisions, considering the applicant's actual circumstances and expenditure on a case-by-case basis.   These types of lenders are also typically more flexible when dealing with mortgage applications from people with a less-than-perfect credit history, as is the case here, particularly if the outstanding debt has now been settled.  As a trade-off for this increased flexibility, borrowers should expect to stump up a larger deposit, typically between 15 per cent and 25 per cent of the purchase price of their new home.  Many specialist lenders' products are only available through mortgage brokers, so I would recommend speaking to a Financial Conduct Authority authorised broker. Helen Crane, This is Money, replies:  I hope the responses above have shown you that all is not lost, and that - depending on your exact circumstances - there are several options you can explore for getting your mortgage.  It may be that the amount you asked for in your application was just slightly too high to tick the affordability check box given your income, outgoings or deposit size.  That is hopefully reasonably easy to rectify by adjusting your budget downwards just a little, elongating your mortgage term slightly or even just seeking a mortgage with a better interest rate to bring down your projected outgoings.  If you do find that it is the cost of living or your credit record that is causing the issue, you may want to take some time to consider what the best course of action is, and how your circumstances might change.  For example, if it is the increased cost of living that is hampering your application, perhaps you or your husband might have a chance to get a modest pay rise in the near future, which could tip you over the affordability threshold.  And if it is the previous debts that are making things difficult, another year or so of building your credit score back up could help, too.  When the time is right, using a broker should help you avoid more failed applications and ensure that you approach the right lender and get a mortgage deal that works for you.  Although your children are growing up fast, some careful planning should mean you secure the home you want in the not too distant future. ",
  "5388d8e2832b9e8abe77fca61ab007e27e314ed4df963adc9d6ddf2d": "Johnny Depp's former agent Christian Carino told the court about emails sent to him by Heard after she broke up with Elon Musk. Heard began dating the Tesla founder around the time of her split with Depp in May 2016 and by August the following year they had broken up. Carino, a talent agent with mega agency CAA and Lady Gaga's ex-fiance, appeared by a pre-recorded video deposition and confirmed that Heard and Musk were in a relationship for a time. Asked if Heard moved on to dating Musk 'immediately after Johnny Depp', Carino said yes. In an email on August 7, 2017, Heard told Carino: 'Dealing with breakup. I hate when things go public. See I'm so sad.' Carino said that he believed Heard was 'referring to breaking up with Elon.' Carino replied to Heard: 'You weren't in love with him. You told me 1,000 times you were just feeling space.' Asked what he meant, Carino said: 'Why would you be sad if you weren't in love with him to begin with?' One of Depp's lawyers asked: 'By him you're referring to who?' Carino said: 'Elon.' Heard's next email read: 'I know but I wanted time to grieve and recover in my own time.' In another email in the same conversation she said: 'I hate that, yet again a man lets me fall on the spikes by myself.' Carino said: 'How so?' Heard emailed back: 'They're mad at me for leaving them and put things like this out there', apparently referring to the story going public. Carino responded: 'You could avoid all this if you stop dating uber famous people.' Asked what he meant in the email, Carino told the court he was trying to tell Heard: 'If you don't like being in the press about your personal life don't date people that are famous.' Carino told the court that Heard's feelings for Depp lingered after she filed for divorce in May 2016 and that he believed she wanted to reconcile with him, even though she was dating Musk. In an email on July 14 that year, Heard told Carino: 'It's so f**ked up I just want to tell him that what they're telling him isn't true.' In an email sent to Carino around the same time, Heard said: 'Please tell him I love him,' referring to Depp. The court heard that in the summer of 2016, Heard asked Carino to set up a meeting with Depp to talk things over. At the time Depp was the subject of a temporary restraining order and Heard said she could 'never accuse him of violating the order' during their meeting, Carino said. It took place in San Francisco where Depp was on tour with his band, The Hollywood Vampires, in the backyard of a friend's house. Carino said they were there for 'several hours' chatting until the owner of the house said he was coming back. To continue the conversation they rented a hotel room but once there Depp and Heard 'started arguing,' Carino testified. Carino said that he left at 5am the following morning - it wasn't clear if the argument was still ongoing. But the court has already heard chilling audio of Depp asking Heard to cut him with a knife, telling her: 'You f**king hate me!' Despite that, Heard's feeling for Depp remained strong. On August 16, 2017, Heard emailed Carino: 'I've written so many notes, can you give him one? I don't know how or where to start. 'Finally I am single, clear in my heart and mind. I just want him to know I loved him.' In a message on June 9, 2018 - six months before Heard wrote the op-ed which is the subject of the case - she messaged Carino: 'God I miss him,' referring to Depp. Earlier in the day, Depp cracked up with laughter as the doorman of his building described how Amber Heard asked him to investigate an intruder due to scratches on their front door - which were caused by the dog. Alejandro Romero said that Heard and her friend Rocky Pennington told him that 'somebody tried to get into my unit' at the Eastern Columbia Building in West Hollywood. Appearing in a pre-taped video deposition, Romero said he thought to himself: 'What? Four inches above the (floor)? The dog was scratching.' He said: 'In my head (I'm thinking) you think someone is trying to get into your unit with scratches four inches above the floor?' At this point Depp started laughing and there was laughter in the public gallery. Romero said: 'They were so scared. They asked me to go inside the unit to check room by room. I did it, it's part of my job.' At one point Romero, who was giving the deposition in his car on his cell phone, could be seen blowing smoke out his nose having apparently just taken a hit from a vaping device. Losing patience he began to drive around, still talking to one of Heard's lawyers on his phone which was stuck on his dashboard. Afterwards Bredehoft, Heard's lawyer, said it was 'the most bizarre deposition' she had ever done. Judge Penney Azcarate added: 'I've never seen that before.' At one point Romero lost his cool and spoke of his frustration at having to speak to the lawyers. He said: 'Ugh. I'm so stressed out because of this, I don't want to deal with this any more'. Romero met Heard on May 25, 2016, four days after the final argument between Heard and Depp before the divorce. She claims he hit her with a mobile phone at the apartment - he denies it. Romero said that he didn't see any bruises and cuts on Heard's face at the time and she was 3ft away from him. Asked if he would have seen anything, given they were so close and the light was good, he said: 'That's correct'. Depp laughed again as an exasperated Romero said he wasn't checking if Heard's 'eyelashes are not even'. There was laughter in court once more when Romero said in response to another question: 'I don't remember what I got for breakfast'. Earlier in the day, a Los Angeles police officer who attended the final argument between Depp and Heard before their divorce said she could have had a red face after 'crying because (her) dog died.' Tyler Hadden said that because Heard was 'uncooperative' he had no idea why she was upset having called 911 at her West Hollywood penthouse. Heard claimed that Depp smacked her with a mobile phone during the May 2016 argument but clammed up when officers arrived. Officer Hadden told the former couple's $100m defamation trial he categorized the incident as a 'verbal dispute' only. The cop told the jury he saw no evidence of injuries on Heard and that her red face was 'consistent with crying'. He said that 'just because I see a female with pink cheeks and pink eyes doesn't mean something happened'. Officer Hadden said the red face could be because the person 'started crying because their dog died'. The question of Heard's injuries that night are crucial to the case as a week later she filed for divorce and obtained a restraining order against Depp, accusing him of domestic violence. She arrived at court with a large bruise on her right cheek, a picture of which was entered into the court file. LAPD officer William Gatlin told the court that he and a colleague went to see Heard again at 10.24pm that night. It appeared that a friend of Heard's had called the New York police department about the incident, and they wanted to return to check on her themselves. The court was shown footage from officer Gatlin's body camera which showed them entering the building and walking down the corridor to the penthouse. Heard's friend Josh Drew answered the door and tried to persuade the officers to leave by telling them that other cops had already come by, but they insisted on going in. Officer Gatlin agreed that Drew was 'uncooperative'. The footage showed the cops entering and asking if Heard was OK, and she confirmed she was. Drew says that Depp is 'definitely' not there any more and had been gone a few hours and the officers left. Officer Gatlin said that when they went inside 'it didn't seem like anybody was particularly eager to talk to us'. The cop said that due to the 'dim lighting' he couldn't see if Heard had any bruises on her face or not. The cop said that based on the LAPD's investigation it appeared Heard was not a victim of domestic violence. He said: 'Based on her refusing to give any statement on what occurred and at the time we did not observe any visible or verifiable injuries to her'. However officer Gatlin said he was 'not in a position' to say if Depp beat up Heard as he was not there when the incident occurred. Officer Gatlin was asked about claims by Heard's former lawyer Adam Waldman in media interviews that Heard and her friends were 'attempting to concoct an abuse hoax.' The cop said he could not recall seeing anything like that. Officer Gatlin was asked if he saw Heard and her friends 'spilling wine and roughing the place up?' He replied that he did not. There was laughter in court when Bredehoft asked the officer if he was a 'fan' of Depp's at the time they went to the property. Officer Gatlin said: 'I guess I liked a couple of his movies, not rush out to see them or anything'. Officer Melissa Saenz appeared via a pre-taped video deposition on Tuesday. She was asked about the visit to the penthouse apartment that Depp and Heard shared on May 21, 2016. Under questioning from Heard's lawyer Elaine Bredehoft, Saenz said, 'I did not identify her as a victim of domestic violence,' adding that she did not see any evidence of a crime, including broken glass or mess in the penthouse.  It was the last argument between Depp and Heard before she filed for a divorce and a restraining order, which she did a week later. In request for the restraining order, Heard claimed that Depp hit her with a cell phone during that encounter, leaving her with a bruise on the right side of her face. In the court file, Heard included an image of the bruise. Bredehoft showed the photo photo of Amber's face to Saenz and asked ,'Do you perceive there to be an injury or evidence of injury on amber's face in this photo?' Saenz responded, 'No I do not.'  Bredehoft asked, 'What is your perception of the redness on the cheek and the eyelid and above the eyebrow?' Saenz responded, 'Its consistent with her crying - she's fair skin, her face is flushed.'  Bredehoft asked, 'You don't think it's consistent with a cell phone being thrown at her?' Saenz responded, 'Correct, it does not look like an injury caused from a cell phone. It's consistent with someone crying.' Bredehoft asked, 'If you saw any signs of injury on Amber Heard or even just damage to the property, would you have been duty bound to make a report?' 'Correct.' Bredehoft asked, 'Now, your recollection is that there was damage to the flat, you searched the entire flat and there was no damage, no broken glass, or anything out of the ordinary, would you agree?' 'Correct' Bredehoft asked, 'When you got back to the elevator is there anything you remember thinking?' Saenz responded, 'I remember being impressed by the penthouse, how big and beautiful it was yes.' Her testimony followed expert witness Dr. Shannon Curry to the stand. The clinical and forensic psychologist told the court she concluded Heard had traits consistent with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and Histrionic Personality Disorder (HPD) - two conditions found in people with patterns of emotional instability and attention-seeking behavior.  Dr. Curry testified that she was initially hired by Depp's lawyers early last year to review files in the legal battle between the two feuding exes and identify behavior in their relationship that may be consistent with 'intimate partner violence'.  The psychology expert, however, revealed her role would shift several months later in October, when she was asked to provide a psychological evaluation of Heard, 36.  'The results of Ms. Heard's evaluation supported two diagnoses: Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and Histrionic Personality Disorder (HPD),' Curry told the court.  She concluded that Heard 'grossly exaggerated' her post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after her relationship with Depp and said that in the actress's eyes, the actor went from being 'idealized to the dumpster.' Dr. Curry noted that Heard's BPD was marked by an 'underlying terror of abandonment' and somebody with the condition tends to make 'desperate attempts' to stop it from happening. These could be 'very extreme behaviors', she said. Curry added that as a result of these disorders, somebody like Heard could appear charming at the start of a friendship or relationship but could then turn dark easily.",
  "accb46231d19c97ad7ccfcd3800e160aa0c1fb16841af35e14e704a8": "A West Australian woman has been charged with murder over the death of a 14-month-old boy who is related to her. The boy was found unresponsive at a home in Madora Bay, south of Perth, when police attended in relation to a noise complaint early on Wednesday. 'The attending officers provided emergency first aid to the child until St John Ambulance personnel arrived,' WA Police said in a statement on Friday. 'Tragically, the child could not be revived.' Neighbours raised the alarm shortly before 5am on Wednesday after they heard shouting and doors banging. The toddler, named Jace, lived at the rented home with his mother and grandmother. Shattered next door neighbour Stan Grostate was one of the last people to see the toddler alive. He held the little boy on Tuesday night so his mother could have a cigarette.  'It's devastating. He was such a cute little boy,' Mr Grostate told reporters. 'He smiled a lot, and used to play with my cat whenever they came over. 'He had just started walking.' A woman, 28, has been refused bail and is due to face Perth Magistrates Court on Saturday.",
  "e98abbcf4f1969125818f7f720c8dc567dd5c2000800f05319e2f5e1": "A picture has emerged of one of the two British charity workers captured by Russian forces after going to Ukraine as humanitarian relief volunteers, as was reported today. Paul Urey was captured with Dylan Healey who were operating on their own in the war zone and hadn't been associated with any aid group, according to Dominik Byrne, the co-founder and chief operating officer of non-profit Presidium Network. The charity said the two men had been detained by Russian troops at a check point south of Zaporizhzhia in southern Ukraine on Monday.  Byrne said the men were taken while trying to carry out an independent evacuation in Dniprorudne, near Zaporizhzhia that is some 290 miles southeast of Kyiv. They had not been heard from since Monday, he said. Byrne added the two men had been trying to evacuate a family, who were later interrogated by Russian forces, and asked about the 'British spies.' The CEO said the family later escaped to Poland. 'Two men who were working as civilian humanitarian relief volunteers were captured on Monday at a checkpoint south of the city of Zaporizhzhia,' the charity said in a statement to the BBC on Friday.  British trade minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan told Sky News: 'The foreign office is doing all it can to support and identify these two people.' There was no immediate comment from the British foreign ministry, but it was understood that it was urgently seeking more information. MailOnline has contacted the foreign office for further information. Zaporizhzhia is a crucial way station for tens of thousands of Ukrainians fleeing Mariupol, the besieged city to the south east which has been largely captured by Russian forces and all-but razed to the ground. News of the capture of the charity workers comes a day after it was confirmed that a British father had been killed in Ukraine, and a second Briton remains missing, after the pair apparently joined local forces fighting against Russia's invasion. Scott Sibley, a 36-year-old veteran of the British armed forces who served in the Commando Logistic Support Squadron in Afghanistan, has been named as the first UK casualty in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Kyiv said Friday that plans were in place to evacuate civilians from the besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol where Ukrainian forces and civilians are encircled by Russian troops. 'An operation to evacuate civilians from the Azovstal factory is planned for today,' the Ukrainian presidency said in a statement. Russia last week said it had gained full control of the strategic port city, except for the huge Azovstal industrial area. President Vladimir Putin ordered a blockade of the steelworks, where hundreds of civilians are sheltering with Ukrainian troops, according to Kyiv, including those requiring medical attention. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said this week that the United Nations was doing everything possible to ensure the evacuation of civilians from the 'apocalypse' in Mariupol. A UN representative to Ukraine said during the visit she was travelling to Zaporizhzhia to prepare for a 'hopeful' evacuation. 'The UN is fully mobilised to help save Ukrainian lives and to assist those in need,' UN in Ukraine Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator Osnat Lubrani said.  Thursday also saw Russian sources publish a list of what they claim are 100 British 'mercenaries' fighting in Ukraine, including the name of one woman.  A pro-war Telegram channel called Rybar with almost 400,000 subscribers claimed the 100 British citizens whose names were published were part of the 'International Legion of Territorial Defence of Ukraine', also known as the Ukrainian Foreign Legion. The list does not include the name of Scott Sibley or two other British men who have been captured, and it is unclear how authentic it is.  The UK's Foreign Office confirmed British national Sibley had been killed in Ukraine and the whereabouts of a second Briton is unknown. It is thought that the two men had been fighting against Russian fighters after joining Ukrainian soldiers as volunteers, but this remains unconfirmed.  Friends of Sibley, fondly nicknamed Sibs, have paid tribute to the veteran, who is believed to have died on 23 April, and set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for his funeral. 'Scott was a son, father, brother and uncle,' his friend Craig wrote on the page. 'To me he was a friend like no other and the bravest person I've had the pleasure to have known, he was as good as a brother to me. 'His life may have been cut short but he lived to the full and did things the Sibs way, right until the end.' Another fundraising page set up for Sibley's relatives described his 'infectious laugh', adding: 'We all have memories with him and he has helped us in different ways.' Sibley leaves behind his daughter who was diagnosed with stage 4 high risk Neuroblastoma, a rare form of cancer that mostly affects young children. Following her diagnosis in 2018, Sibley shaved his head so that his daughter would not feel different when she lost her hair, reported the BBC.  Sibley's former squadron, the Army's Logistic Support Squadron, paid tribute to the veteran, writing: 'This week the Sqn has lost a former serving soldier. A man that showed Commando spirit until the end. RIP. Scott Sibley.' A former comrade, Alex Darwin, paid tribute to his friend. 'Sib, I'm in complete disbelief. What a pleasure to have served alongside you, to know you and to have experienced your kind nature. 'You were there for me and I will forever be grateful. One hell of a beautiful guy, inside and out.'",
  "70a521ebbe1dfc358b5e14093536e5525f5a02c5245cc7e100f94c83": "One Nation leader Pauline Hanson has cried censorship after the latest episode of her 'Please Explain' cartoon series was ripped from social media following a complaint from the Australian Electoral Commission. The video has been removed from Facebook and TikTok after the AEC branded it 'misleading and false'. The cartoon showed a character based on Labor's Senator Penny Wong delivering a batch of fake votes to her bed-bound Covid-stricken leader, Anthony Albanese.  'I brought you these,' she tells him. 'These are postal votes under the names of dead people, fake identities, some were stolen out of letterboxes.' The fake senator then falsely claimed that the Australian Electoral Commission doesn't check identification documents as that would be 'racist'. However the AEC stressed on Friday that IDs are checked when Australians enrol to vote. The skit - one of a lengthy series by Ms Hanson's team - prompted a warning from the AEC, and later its deletion or restriction by several social media platforms. The AEC wrote on Twitter they found the video 'deeply, deeply disappointing'. The commission revealed they'd spent Friday reviewing the video to confirm it was misleading and 'working with social platforms to have it removed for violating their policies around misleading electoral information.' Twitter allowed it to remain online but attached a tag to the video warning viewers it contained misleading information. Senator Hanson shared a series of screenshots showing the video was unavailable to Facebook users. 'Your post goes against our Community Standards on voter suppression,' the warning said. The politician claimed TikTok had 'censored' the episode and Twitter was limiting shares and likes.  Ms Hanson said her party was fighting 'continuously' for electoral reforms and said she would not remove the video herself. 'Sometimes the truth hurts, so I won't be taking down the cartoon on any social media platform,' Ms Hanson wrote. The AEC said on Friday: 'We agree that satire is an important tool and it's genuinely great to see it used effectively. 'Unfortunately in this case, it's been used to spread misleading information about electoral security.' The AEC added on Twitter that Ms Hanson's attempts at undermining democratic confidence were 'extremely disappointing'.  'Aspects of it are clearly false, and any registered party would know this,' the AEC posted. 'No election the AEC has run has had a margin smaller than the number of alleged multiple votes [and] ID is required when you enrol to vote.'",
  "c05c44b5600ed10221786040de2cb2b8110547064c07dcdc2ad2b980": "The victim of a savage murder described in an interview before she died how an attack by a cleaner destroyed her 'dream world' and made her to want to killer-proof her Sydney home. Ninety-two-year-old Marjorie Welsh wished to make her home more safe because of a savage attack by Hanny Papanicolaou that ultimately led to her death. In an interview recorded shortly after she was stabbed and bludgeoned by Papanicolaou on January 2, 2019, Ms Welsh said the attack had robbed her of her 'dream world' of feeling comfortable and happy within her home. 'I wouldn't trust anyone anymore. I'm having special gates when I'm back. I'm just making it thief-proof, killer-proof,' she said. In the interview, Ms Welsh is seen cut and bruised in a hospital bed less than a week after being attacked by Papanicolaou. Ms Welsh died six weeks after the attack in her Sydney inner west home. Ms Welsh's daughters Angela MacLeod and Elizabeth Welsh were watching on at a Supreme Court sentencing hearing on Friday, with Ms Welsh breaking down in sobs when her mother's interview was played. In February Papanicolaou was found guilty of the murder of Ms Welsh who was stabbed multiple times with a knife and bashed with her walking sticks and fine china. Papanicolaou had been working at Ms Welsh's house as a cleaner for a year before the attack. Crown prosecutor Christopher Taylor said Papanicolaou, 38, intended to kill Ms Welsh because she did not want to be seen breaking into her client's home in an attempted robbery. A sufficient sentence was required as a deterrent so senior citizens could live their lives without fear of violence, Mr Taylor said on Friday. As a vulnerable person who had difficulty moving or seeing, Ms Welsh was forced to the ground by Papanicolaou, who snatched her mobile phone out of her hands and unplugged a violent fall alarm from the wall. 'This was a savage and sustained attack by a young woman upon a much older woman with the use of no less than a knife to penetrate multiple times the chest and abdomen of the deceased,' Mr Taylor said. Papanicolaou's lawyers claim she intended to cause grievous bodily harm rather than murder. Her legal team also argues she was suffering from major depressive disorder, including post-natal depression from a premature birth, at the time of the attack. 'So much of Ms Papanicolaou's life has been lived without any acts of violence. She's managed to do many pro-social things. She's got plenty of incentive to reform,' said her barrister Tom Quilter. During the trial the court heard that on the morning of the attack, the regular gambler lost $430 from poker machines in under an hour and was left with just $11 in her bank account. The crown case alleged that Papanicolaou found out Ms Welsh had received $8 million from a property sale, and thought she would be away on holiday until the end of January. During her testimony, Papanicolaou told the jury she had felt increasingly isolated in an unhappy marriage, was deeply depressed and escaped her problems through gambling. Mr Quilter said while his client would spend years in jail, she deserved a shorter sentence because she had been assaulted while in prison after being seen on television over the murder trial. Speaking outside court, Ms MacLeod welcomed remarks that senior citizens deserved to feel safe within their home as a sanctuary. Ms MacLeod called her mother's video interview confronting, but said she was amazed her mother could still be herself at such a time. 'Mum was someone who could achieve anything she wanted to in life. Life wasn't always perfect for mum ... but she was strong, intelligent, loving, protective, all those things that you'd want in a mum. We were always very proud of her,' she said. Justice Robertson Wright did not hand down a prison sentence immediately but will do so at a later date.",
  "214ac14d3c3ef31051afbd6dc765c1bbb4eff8958d76d35d399d029a": "Cheap foreign agency staff hired by disgraced operator P&O Ferries to replace the nearly 800 experienced seafarers it sensationally sacked six weeks ago didn't know how to use life-saving appliances, a damning new report has found.  A total of 23 failures ranging from fire rescue boats not being properly maintained and oil filtering equipment not working to fire safety systems and deficiencies with working conditions were found by Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) inspectors on Spirit of Britain, a 700ft cross-Channel vessel impounded by UK authorities earlier this month. According to the Paris Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), which is an alliance of 27 national maritime authorities including the UK, there was a 'lack of familiarity' with the 'operation of life-saving appliances', which could relate to equipment such as rescue boats, lifeboats, life-jackets or flares. Thirty-one safety failures were also found by the MCA on another P&O Ferries vessel, European Causeway, resulting in it being detained on March 25. Analysis has revealed that was more than in any of the other 46,000 Port State Control inspections of ships within the Paris MOU in the past three years.  Spirit of Britain was detained following the inspection on April 11, before being cleared to sail on April 22. The vessel was used by P&O Ferries to restart operations between Dover and Calais on Tuesday for the first time since the company sacked hundreds of staff and replaced them with PS5.50-an-hour agency workers on March 17 to save money. The firm has been mired in controversy since it fired nearly 800 experienced seafarers with no notice last month and replaced them with cheaper foreign agency workers. Its beleaguered millionaire CEO Peter Hebblethwaite later admitted to a committee of MPs that the sackings broke the law. RMT general secretary Mick Lynch called the report 'further evidence that P&O is a capitalist bandit sailing in our waters', raging: 'The lack of care and respect P&O clearly has for safety regulations - that are designed to save lives in the event of maritime emergencies - is on a par with their appalling treatment of the loyal 800-strong workforce who were sacked last month. 'There can be no doubt that the public and haulage firms should boycott P&O Ferries on safety, security and moral grounds until the Government steps in and takes over the running of this rogue maritime operator.'  European Causeway was cleared to sail on April 8, but was left adrift in the Irish Sea for more than an hour on Tuesday after it suffered a power failure, in yet another PR crisis for the company. It was rescued by three lifeboats and a tugboat before it regained power shortly before 2.15pm, much to the relief of passengers on board who had endured blackouts. After the ship got back to the port, a number of the new crew members reportedly asked maritime unions for advice about terminating their contracts. The MCA said European Causeway can sail again with a restriction on what generators it can use for electricity. A total of eight P&O Ferries vessels will be probed by the agency following the mass sackings. Pride of Kent remains under detention after failing an inspection, while Pride of Canterbury and Spirit of France are also out of action as they have not been fully examined. Pride of Hull, Norbay and European Highlander were all allowed to resume sailings. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the Transport Select Committee on Wednesday that he ordered the MCA to scrutinise the ships 'with a fine-tooth comb'. A P&O Ferries spokesperson said: 'The safety of our passengers and crew is our foremost priority and any suggestion that it is being compromised in any way is categorically false. 'It is clear that the safety inspections of our vessels have reached an unprecedented level of rigour and we welcome this additional scrutiny to help us come back even better than before. We look forward to all of our ships welcoming tourist passengers and freight customers again as soon as all mandatory safety tests have been passed and we are satisfied the vessels are ready to re-enter service. 'Safety remains paramount in our new crewing management model, which is used by many of our competitors and has been proven to be a successful model in this industry.' The MCA has said its inspectors work 'in exactly the same robust way' for every ship. Meanwhile, there has been fury from unions after ITV News saw contracts, known as Seafarer's Employment Agreements, showing agency workers on one of the company's Dover ferries being paid a basic wage of $860 (PS683) a month for a 40 hour working week - an hourly rate of pay of PS3.94. The contract sets out additional rates for overtime, leave and a subsistence allowance, which P&O insists rises the rate of pay to PS5.10 an hour, based on an 84-hour working week. Chief executive Peter Hebblethwaite - who is paid some PS325,000 a year - told MPs the lowest hourly rate agency crews would earn would be PS5.15, when he appeared before a joint select committee hearing last month. Frances O'Grady of the Trades Union Congress told ITV: 'Make no mistake - these are sweatshop conditions. P&O has deliberately sacked experienced, unionised staff so that it can replace them with agency workers on poverty pay. 'These 'union-busting' tactics should worry all of us. If companies are allowed to get away with acting like corporate gangsters no worker is safe.' A P&O spokesman said: 'It is misleading to assert that any agency seafarer is paid PS3.94 an hour.  Everyone working on the ship is contractually entitled to receive a basic salary plus guaranteed overtime, a leave allowance, a subsistence allowance and a bonus.  'Taken together, the minimum rate of hourly pay is the equivalent of PS5.58 an hour and nobody working on board our ships is paid less. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps declared it is 'completely unsustainable' that P&O Ferries chief executive Peter Hebblethwaite remains in his job after sacking 800 seafarers without notice. Mr Shapps told the Commons' Transport Select Committee 'he will have to go' and also urged the Dubai-owned company Hebblethwaite works for to repay PS11 million of furlough money. The Tory minister also insisted 'they will have to pay the minimum wage' to crews. The drama in the Irish Sea was yet another public relations disaster for the scandal-hit firm - just weeks after it sparked fury by firing 800 UK staff over zoom and replacing them with cheaper foreign crews.  Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng announced earlier this month that the Insolvency Service had started 'formal criminal and civil investigations' into the company, which he said he would be 'following closely' along with Mr Grant Shapps. 'It is important to note that the rates paid to our agency seafarers are above the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) minimum standards. We fully welcome the Government's commitment to increasing the minimum wage for all seafarers working in British waters and have called for a level playing field when it comes to pay and conditions on British ferry routes.' The Rail, Maritime and Transport union attributed the European Causeway crisis to the vessel having 'inexperienced crew', as seafarers 'familiar with the ship would have been able to keep it under power'.  RMT boss Darren Procter said crew on board the European Causeway had claimed that engine parts were changed with the firm's European Highlander 'in order to pass its inspection', the Telegraph reported. It was yet another public relations disaster for the scandal-hit firm - just weeks after it sparked fury by firing 800 UK staff over zoom and replacing them with cheaper foreign crews.  Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng announced earlier this month that the Insolvency Service had started 'formal criminal and civil investigations' into the company, which he said he would be 'following closely' along with Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. It comes as Mr Shapps repeated his calls for P&O Ferries' Mr Hebblethwaite to resign. The Transport Secretary said Mr Hebblethwaite's position was 'completely unsustainable', adding: 'He will have to go.'  He also called on P&O Ferries to pay back the PS11million it took in taxpayer-funded furlough money. Appearing before the Commons transport committee on Wednesday, Mr Shapps said: 'There are three things that P&O will need to do to get out of this mess and I call upon them today publicly to get on and do it. 'First of all, it's completely unsustainable to have the head of P&O, the boss Peter Hebblethwaite, who came to a committee room like this and openly and deliberately explained how he sought to break the law, he actually said that was his intention and that he would do it again... He will have to go. 'Secondly, in my view, though it's a matter for P&O themselves, I think that they need to repay furlough money as well. 'It's around PS11million. I don't think it's right that having claimed that money they then sacked the workers in such a premeditated way, which they themselves admitted broke the law. 'Thirdly, they will have to pay the minimum wage [under new laws being introduced in May].' Mr Shapps said that he was working with opposite numbers in Paris and Dublin to establish 'corridors' that do not allow ferry crew to be paid less than the national minimum wage. The new laws he is introducing will only require the UK minimum wage to be paid in British waters. P&O Ferries pays its new crew an average of PS5.50 per hour, which it has insisted is in line with international maritime laws. Mr Shapps announced yesterday that legislation forcing ferry operators using UK ports to pay seafarers at least the national minimum wage of PS9.50 per hour will be included in the Queen's Speech on May 10. P&O Ferries said it would 'fully welcome' measures to increase pay for all seafarers in British waters as it wants 'a level playing field'. Irish Ferries, which also uses a low-cost labour model, began competing with the firm on the Dover to Calais route in June 2021.",

PC Ireland Murdock is said to have committed the assault on September 25 last year in Lambeth, South London, and he was arrested on January 11 this year. The officer, attached to the force's Central North Command Unit in Camden and Islington in North London, has been suspended from duty since being arrested. Appearing at Croydon Magistrates' Court today wearing a red suit and tie and white shirt, Murdock spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth and address. During the short five-minute hearing, the officer from Teddington in South West London was not asked to enter any plea to the alleged offence. Reading the allegations, the court clerk told Murdock that it was claimed the woman 'did not consent and you did not reasonably believe that she was consenting'. Prosecutor Nathan Fuller made few representations to the court, only speaking to say the case was not suitable to be dealt with by a magistrates' court. He also said that the officer should be released on bail, but banned from contacting his alleged victim directly or indirectly. Kiera Oluwunmi, representing Murdock, made no objection to the bail condition and made no other representations to the judge. District Judge Polly Gledhill released the defendant on bail to appear before Inner London Crown Court next month. He was banned from contacting the woman. She told him: 'Your case is one that can only be dealt with by a crown court and I am going to send your case to a crown court today. 'I am going to release you on bail on one condition, that you do not contact your alleged victim directly or indirectly.' The case was adjourned to Inner London Crown Court on May 27. The force said Murdock's alleged victim is being supported by specialist officers. Scotland Yard confirmed that its Directorate of Professional Standards and the Independent Office for Police Conduct have both been informed.",

  "a0facc74fc464efacb8e8e1c020ffe0f7eb7c86add6cd54ba72d6595": "A picture has come to light of Liberal election candidate Katherine Deves in a skimpy dress at Sydney's Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras - after she took to the airwaves to claim she's not anti-trans.   Prime Minister Scott Morrison's 'captain's pick' for the Sydney northern beaches seat of Warringah told Ben Fordham on 2GB on Friday that Australians were in her corner when it came to trans women participating in female sports.  The Federal election campaign has been roiled by a series of incendiary tweets Ms Deves once shared describing trans children as 'sterilised' and 'mutilated'.  However one unearthed tweet, now deleted, paints a different picture - featuring an image of Ms Deves rocking out with a friend at Mardi Gras in the 1990s. 'Back in the 90s, when Sydney Mardi Gras was still a grassroots street parade with a killer party at Hordern celebrating the progress of gay and lesbian rights,' she wrote in the tweet, seen by Daily Mail Australia.  It comes as Ms Deves revealed why she got involved in the issue of trans people in sports as she has three little girls who play different sports. 'I saw that little girls and young women should have someone standing up representing their interests and all I ever wanted was for this debate to be held in the public domain. Fordham asked Ms Deves directly whether she was transphobic. 'Oh of course not, Ben,' she responded.  'This isn't about (transphobia), this argument is about women and girls.  'Back in the early 1990s I was going to Mardi Gras, I voted for same-sex marriage, I don't have an issue with that but this is about a collision of rights and we just need to be able to debate it in a respectful way.' Ms Deves also said she could still win Warringah.  'I wouldn't have stood up if I didn't believe I had a chance to win,' she said.   In the wake of Ms Deves' comments, there have been multiple calls for Ms Deves to be disendorsed, including by prominent Liberals North Sydney MP Trent Zimmerman and NSW Treasurer Matt Kean. Ms Deves faces an uphill battle to reclaim Warringah for the Liberals, with the former blue-ribbon seat currently held by independent MP Zali Steggall by more than seven per cent. Ms Steggall was $1.04 favourite to win the seat while Ms Deves is at $9, according to the most recent Sportsbet odds.  Ms Deves has become a divisive figure following a number of provocative comments on her Twitter account - which she has since deleted. She once declared trans teenagers are 'surgically mutilated' and felt personally 'triggered' by the rainbow Pride flag. The Warringah candidate also bizarrely linked cross-dressing males and and trans women to 'sexual predators, even serial killers'. 'Transvestism is very common among sexual predators, even serial killers,' she said in a historical tweet. 'So how are we women supposed to tell the difference between the ones who are a threat and the ones who aren't? Easier for women to exclude all males from spaces where we are vulnerable.' Last September Ms Deves described the prospect of two gay men having a baby as a 'vanity project.' 'Surrogacy is a human rights violation,' she tweeted. 'Women's bodies are not vehicles for a vanity project.' Ms Deves was referring to Pete Buttigieg, the first openly gay U.S. presidential candidate, and his husband, who are joint fathers of twin girls. In another tweet, Ms Deves said 'transablism' - where trans people pretend to be disabled - is 'a thing' and likened people in that category to a well-known serial killer. Mr Morrison subsequently defended her as the party's candidate as she received a torrent of online abuse over the comments. 'She is standing up for women and girls and their access to fair sport in this country,' the PM said. 'She has learned in her advocacy in her private life there are better ways to do things to take things forward as a Member of Parliament. 'I believe that is how she will approach the task if she is elected as the member for Warringah, and I don't think she should be silenced.'",
  "f1bfe7ebf39d3688396a1091cd9f4f88c0e16dde014b4162f940dd34": "The man who killed four children walking together to an ice cream shop is appealing his prison sentence on the grounds it 'is manifestly excessive' and he had ADHD while driving drunk and on drugs. Samuel William Davidson was driving erratically and speeding when he struck Veronique Sakr, 11, and her cousins, Sienna Abdallah, eight, and her siblings Angelina, 12, and Antony, 13. The children had been walking to buy ice-creams when the 31-year-old ploughed into them after his ute mounted a kerb on Bettington Rd, at Oatlands, in Sydney's northwest on February 1 in 2020. Davdison was sentenced last year to a maximum 28-year prison sentence with a minimum 21 year sentence which does not expire until 2041. In his bid to have the prison sentence slashes, which will be heard on Monday in the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, Davidson will argued that the term is 'manifestly excessive'. The second ground listed for his appeal is that the sentencing judge made an 'error in holding  no causal link between ADHD and commission of offences'.  The appeal is listed before Justices Paul Brereton, Christine Adamson and Natalie Adams.  Davidson is two-and-a-half years into his sentence and is not expected to be eligible for parole until 2041.  Both the Abdullah children's parents Danny and Leila and Sakr families have shown remarkable grace in the wake of the horrific incident, with Danny saying said he forgave Davidson 'for your sake, for my sake, and most importantly for my family's sake'. But he also said at the time of Davidson's sentencing that it did not matter whether he received one year or 100 years, 'we won't get Antony, Angelina, Sienna and Veronique back'.  'We will all have our hearts broken until the day we take our last breath and no sentence can help ease that pain.'  One bright spot in the lives of the Abdallahs was in March this year when Danny and Leila welcomed a new baby girl, who they called Selina because it echoed the names of Sienna and Angelina.  In sentencing Davidson at Parramatta's District Court in April, Judge James Bennett said Davidson's menacing, dangerous and aggressive driving over a significant period leading up to the tragic event showed all responsibility to the road safety of others was abandoned.  The tragedy was inevitable, but the magnitude of the tragedy extended to the unimaginable, Judge Bennett said.  The professional truck driver was afforded a 25 per cent discount on sentence after pleading guilty to manslaughter for the children he killed and also pleading guilty to three charges relating to the injuries caused to three other children.  One boy has suffered permanent brain damage.    Davidson, the son of a former policeman, had been sitting poolside with his housemates drinking Vodka Cruisers and beers, having his first drink about 7am before consuming drugs and driving on February 1, 2020. He was observed by witnesses speeding through a red light, swerving anti-clockwise around a round-about, and driving at a maximum speed of 133km/h in a 50km/h zone. After the crash, Davidson appeared distressed and was heard saying: 'What have I done? ... I have killed people ... I am going to jail.'   Judge Bennett acknowledged Davidson suffered from ADHD but did not accept impulsivity that day caused him to drive, seen in his consciousness of guilt immediately after the crash. After Davidson's sentencing, Mr Abdallah said his main disappointment lay in Australian culture's love of drugs and alcohol.  'That's where my frustration is, more than the driver.'  Judge Bennett acknowledged Davidson suffered from ADHD but did not accept impulsivity that day caused him to drive, seen in his consciousness of guilt immediately after the crash. Davidson's letter of apology stated that he is heartbroken to have hurt such beautiful families by his horrid actions and that he would do anything to relive that day sober and never leaving the house.

  "46a7a59315e48b7b93ce25383d6da750cda7722356e795700e5c106b": "The red flatbed trucks began arriving after dawn, men in white hazmat suits unloading sections of green metal caging. Residents peered nervously from windows of tall apartment blocks, as the figures below erected the fencing across the entrances to their skyscrapers, caging them into their homes. This is the Pudong district of Shanghai, deemed a high-risk Covid area in need of what the city authorities call 'hard isolation', and where residents say they are being treated like animals. 'Could we also put fences around the homes of Shanghai leaders?' asked one, as their photos and videos coursed through Chinese social media, pursued by the Communist Party's ever-zealous censors. The story is the same in the rest of Shanghai's districts. One video shows more hazmat-suited workers drilling the doors shut at a restaurant in the city to prevent those inside from leaving. Two elderly men look out in disbelief. Elsewhere, more men-in-white beat a group of residents demanding food, lashing out viciously with long sticks. Phone cameras caught still more PPE-wearing thugs slapping and shoving boys and girls into a van to be taken to one of the city's 100 compulsory quarantine centres that await all those testing positive. Sometimes the scenes have bordered on the surreal. One video posted on Monday showed young children arriving at school clad in all-encompassing white hazmat suits of their own. They lumbered through the school gate in unwieldy fashion, like tiny Michelin Men, waving awkwardly at the camera. This is the face of China's extraordinary -- and barbaric -- zero-Covid policy. For many of Shanghai's residents, the draconian lockdown has lasted more than three weeks. Countless numbers have been confined to their homes, under strict government instruction to isolate even if they don't have the virus. Neighbourhoods are divided into three categories based on the risk of transmission. Those in the first category endure the strictest Covid-19 controls and have just been hit with heightened measures. The 2 m-high green fences now block entrances to residential housing in many of these areas. It appears they are designed to stop those living inside a complex that has a reported Covid case from leaving their homes -- whether or not they have the virus. Under China's unbending controls, anyone over the age of seven who tests positive -- even if they are asymptomatic or have a mild infection -- must be isolated in centralised quarantine facilities. Despite evidence that the Omicron variant is less deadly than the original strain, China persists in its leader Xi Jinping's determination to eradicate the virus completely -- a policy that is now devastating its economy, and has even prompted Western stock markets to tumble. While the focus has been on Shanghai, which has so far recorded 400,000 cases and 138 deaths, all but 13 of China's richest 100 cities have imposed some form of quarantine restriction, and the intensity is increasing. The capital, Beijing, has launched mass testing for some 3.5 million people who live and work in the city's biggest district of Chaoyang, after 26 cases were reported over the weekend. Schools and gyms are closing down, while vegetables, toilet paper and instant noodles are sold out in the city's supermarkets as people stockpile, fearful of a lockdown as harsh as Shanghai's. That city's outbreak is China's worst since Wuhan, and it has been like a virtual ghost town since going into lockdown in early April. Chinese social media has exploded with anger in a way not seen since the early days of the pandemic in Wuhan, with censors struggling to eliminate the criticism. At nightfall, Shanghai's districts echo with the sound of pots and pans being banged in protest. This time, the concern is not predominantly with the virus itself, but with food shortages. Those allowed to visit supermarkets have reported empty shelves. For those unable to leave their homes, commercial food services and government-provided packages are unreliable. People have reported waking up in the early hours of the morning to order supplies online, only to be told that deliveries have already been suspended for the day. Since Shanghai's tap water is not drinkable, deliveries of bottled water are vital. The food scarcity has even driven some to forage roadside plants -- leading to reported cases of food poisoning. There have been harrowing online pleas for help with medicine and food as a video emerged of residents of a high-rise apartment yelling from their windows: 'We're starving.' Another showed people fighting over food. One flashpoint has been the conditions in Shanghai's mandated quarantine centres. From these facilities have emerged reports of overflowing lavatories, cold showers and little privacy. In one, 4,000 people were living in cubicles next to each other in a vast exhibition hall, with no showers. There was a national outcry over a video showing crying children separated from their parents and crammed into metal-barred beds. Elsewhere, a man who had lost the will to live threatened to throw himself off the indoor balcony of one crowded quarantine facility. Meanwhile, thousands of Chinese social media users unable to leave their apartments have shared stories of people with life-threatening illnesses who have been unable to get treatment. Trucks bringing supplies into the city have their cab doors sealed, to prevent the driver getting out. Plastic buckets are handed to them through the windows should they need the toilet. A harrowing six-minute video, entitled Voices Of April, contains audio snippets of anger and grief as a drone-camera slowly moves over the city. The snippets include the cries of babies separated from their parents in quarantine, pleas for food and urgent medical care -- as well as the cold indifference of officials. It went viral, but censors eventually deleted it. Other social media mocked the authorities by posting images from the movie Night Of The Living Dead, suggesting China's business capital of 25 million people was experiencing its own zombie apocalypse. That analogy seemed all the more fitting on Monday as the city was lashed with heavy rain and winds, sending litter bins flying across the empty roads. Despite the clamours for relaxing lockdown measures, President Xi insists: 'Prevention and control work cannot be relaxed' and 'Persistence is victory'. Many Chinese epidemiologists regard that as lunacy, but it is Xi's lunacy and in today's China, the 'emperor' cannot be questioned. Complete 'victory' over the virus has become a key part of the cult of Xi. It underpins the Communist Party's triumphalism and Xi's boasts of China being superior to the bungling West. In the parallel world of official propaganda, China's state-owned media insists there is 'faith in zero-Covid policy' and 'Residents' lives made easier'. Such claims are widely ridiculed. It is hard to think of any other country, even among autocracies, that could impose China's combination of claustrophobic surveillance and casual brutality towards those who disobey the party. The surveillance has reached new extremes, including the deployment of robots and drones to herd Shanghai's desperate population. The robots include a dog called Preserved Egg (named after a famous Chinese dish), about the size of a terrier. It roams Shanghai's deserted streets and apartment corridors barking orders to stay inside and rousing residents when it is their turn to come downstairs for yet another round of compulsory testing. On Monday, there was a revolt at the city's famous Fudan University, which has been festooned with cameras to enforce lockdown rules. 'It's a university, not a concentration camp' . . . 'Against surveillance! Against bureaucracy! Against micro-fascism' were just some of the banners that went up on campus (and spread on social media) after more white suits were photographed installing cameras outside the female toilet. Shanghai's stock exchange saw its biggest fall in two years on Monday, tumbling by more than 5 per cent. That was partly out of the fear that Beijing may soon follow Shanghai into lockdown. The economic cost of endless and severe lockdowns is undeniable. Even Li Keqiang, China's premier and the man nominally in charge of economic affairs is sounding increasingly rattled, talking about the 'greater uncertainties and challenges' ahead. China has been spooked by the way Covid-19 has swept through Hong Kong, where death rates reached the highest in the world. Like in Hong Kong, vaccination rates among the elderly are low in China -- only half the over-80s are fully vaccinated and just a fifth are boosted. Add to that the lower efficacy rate of Chinese vaccines and China is highly vulnerable, even though the fast spreading Omicron variant is less deadly. The Communist Party is becoming increasingly prickly, and as always is on the search for foreign conspirators to blame. Officials have accused the U.S. of 'weaponising' the crisis, after the State Department ordered non-emergency staff to leave its Shanghai consulate -- a move that was motivated more by China's measures to control the virus than by the virus itself. The U.S. announcement cited the risks of parents and children being separated -- the forceable removal of Covid-positive children to quarantine has been one of the most controversial of Shanghai's lockdown practices. One widely-shared social media post asked, not unreasonably, whether the zero-Covid policy was not causing far more harm than the virus itself. The post was deleted. Ultimately, zero-Covid is a political strategy -- Xi Jinping's talisman. Too much is at stake for him, especially this year, when he is expected to be anointed by the party as leader for life. Xi has boxed himself into a corner. He is playing a large, expensive and increasingly futile game of Whac-A-Mole. It is hard to see how zero-Covid can be sustained. It is under strain as never before, and it is in Shanghai that its future is likely to be determined. Ian Williams is author of Every Breath You Take: China's New Tyranny, published by Birlinn.",
  "dd46e9ccf6d11b60d430fa18ef49467ccb00ba97894c98b250bb402b": "Boris Becker arrived at court with his girlfriend Lilian de Carvalho Monteiroa today ahead of his sentencing hearing that could see him jailed for up to seven years for flouting the terms of his bankruptcy. The former world number one, 54, was dressed smartly in a suit and wearing a Wimbledon tie as he walked up the steps and into the Southwark Crown Court building while holding hands with his partner shortly before noon. Becker then entered the dock of the court, while his eldest son came into the courtroom carrying a large Puma-branded bag, which the tennis star had previously been seen carrying outside his home. The three-time Wimbledon champion was found guilty on April 8 of transferring hundreds of thousands of pounds from his business account and failing to declare a property in his hometown of Leimen, Germany. Judge Deborah Taylor will sentence the six-time Grand Slam champion, who has a previous conviction for tax evasion and attempted tax evasion in Germany in 2002, at the court in Central London this afternoon. This morning, he was seen carrying a green Puma canvas holdall as he stepped out of his West London home and into a black taxi to head to the court. Earlier in the day, he also went out to buy a bouquet of flowers. Yesterday, Becker spent what could be his last day of freedom browsing Harrods and visiting an unknown woman in her council flat. The father-of-four was photographed in Knightsbridge, Paddington and Notting Hill. Wearing a grey jacket and a baseball cap, he was spotted taking a taxi to a council estate in Bayswater to visit a woman before emerging 90 minutes later to go shopping in Harrods - where a guard ushered him in through a side entrance. He later walked home clutching the Puma holdall. Tennis legend Boris Becker has been left with nothing to show for his 'glittering' sporting career and will have to rely on charity to survive, his lawyer has said. The three-time Wimbledon Champion, 54, was declared bankrupt in 2017 over a loan from private bank Arbuthnot Latham against his estate in Mallorca. His barrister Jonathan Laidlaw QC said the bank now has the property, which Becker said was worth about 50 million euros (PS42 million) at the height of the property market. He said the six-time grand slam champion will lose any interest he has in any other property or asset he has. 'This defendant has lost literally everything and he has already paid an extremely heavy price both for the mismanagement of his financial affairs, which of course he has nobody to blame but himself, but also for his offending,' he said. 'Boris Becker has literally nothing and there is also nothing to show for what was the most glittering of sporting careers, and that is correctly termed as nothing short of a tragedy.' Mr Laidlaw said Becker, who after retirement coached current world number one Novak Djokovic, worked as a TV sports commentator for broadcasters including the BBC, and acted as a brand ambassador for firms such as Puma, does not have a future. 'His fall is not simply a fall from grace but amounts to the most public humiliation for this man,' he said. 'The degree of his suffering, and it will continue, is punishment that no other bankrupt in this country is likely to ever experience. 'These proceedings have destroyed his career entirely and ruined any further prospect of earning an income. His reputation is in tatters. 'He will not be able to find work and will have to rely on the charity of others if he is to survive.' A London court has heard how he transferred PS350,000 to other accounts, hid a property in Germany and failed to declare 75,000 shares in an IT firm and a PS700,000 loan. He was legally obliged to disclose all of his assets after being declared bankrupt in 2017. The six-time Grand Slam winner, who was found guilty of four charges under the Insolvency Act, now faces losing lucrative contracts with TV networks around the world, including his job as a BBC pundit at Wimbledon. On Wednesday, Becker was embraced by his girlfriend as he took a cigarette break during a meeting with documentary maker George Chignell in London. And last weekend, he was pictured with estranged wife Lilly and their 12-year-old boy in south London before the father and son met up with Miss de Carvalho Monteiro. The tennis star, who lived in Monte Carlo and Switzerland before moving to the UK, told the court he had 'expensive lifestyle commitments', including a PS22,000-a-month rental house in Wimbledon, South West London. Becker was declared bankrupt on June 21 2017 over an unpaid loan of more than PS3million on his estate in Mallorca. He had been accused of hiding millions of pounds worth of assets, including two Wimbledon trophies, to avoid paying his debts. He claimed he had cooperated with trustees tasked with securing his assets, even offering up his wedding ring, and had acted on expert advice. Today, Rebecca Chalkley, prosecuting, told the court: 'Looking at the way the case was put and the route to verdict it is the prosecution submission that the jury rejected his case that he did not act dishonestly and must have found that he did' She continued: 'None of the money in count four, the money transferred to third parties, was in sterling PS390,000. It is the prosecution case the full amount is recoverable or should be accounted for and not just the 50 per cent that Mr Laidlaw submits. 'It is correct the jury has found the defendant didn't know about the prescribed period, or they did conclude that the transfer to the other Boris Becker accounts was not concealments but they did find him guilty on transfer to the third parties which are these payments. 'The transfer of all of the payments the jury must have concluded that it was deliberate and dishonest. 'Applying the way the case was put, there is a way to see the jury returned the verdicts they did looking at the difference between the prescribed period and the bankrupt period, the third parties and to the separate Boris Becker accounts.' She said the house in Leimen that has yet to be sold is worth PS1.53million. Ms Chalkley said: 'The reason the full amount is listed is that he sought to deprive that amount from the estate and at the moment that has not been returned to the creditors. 'It will be available yes, but there is a distinction to be drawn from the money lost, and in regards to actual money lost is the PS390,000 and what was sought to be lost was the PS1.53million.' Boris Franz Becker was born in Leimen, a town in north-west Germany, in 1967. He began playing tennis at a young age with fellow tennis star and future world Number 1 Steffi Graf. Both of the pair are credited with making tennis a popular sport in the country. Becker became a part of the German Tennis Federation in 1978 and turned pro in 1984. A year later he won Wimbledon at the age of 17 after beating Kevin Curren and became a crowd favourite, affectionately nicknamed Boom Boom for his powerful ground strokes. Becker was the only unseeded player and first German to do so at the time, as well as the youngest male to win. The title of the youngest male to win a Grand Slam tournament was later scooped from him by Michael Chang at the French Open four years later. He won Wimbledon again a year later and in 1989, and was a finalist there in 1988, 1990, 1991, and 1995. He also helped his nation win the coveted Davis Cup in 1988 and 1989 and went on to win the Australian Open in 1991 and 1996. Becker was ranked world number one in 1991 following his first Australian Open win. The tennis star announced his retirement following a straight sets quarter final defeat against Pat Rafter in 1999. He went on to become a coach and became head coach for current world number 1 Novak Djokovic for three years from 2013. During his 16-year professional tennis career, Becker was a six-time Grand Slam champion and collected 49 singles titles out of 77 finals. He married Barbara Feltus in 1993 and the couple had two children - a son, Noah, who was born in 1994, and a daughter, Elias, born in 1999. In December 2000 the couple announced they were separating. A year later, Becker was forced to concede that he was the father of Russian model Angela Ermakova's daughter Anna following a High Court battle. In 2002, Becker was convicted for tax evasion and attempted tax evasion in Germany. Seven years later, he announced he was engaged to Dutch model Sharlely 'Lilly' Kerssenberg. She gave birth in 2010 to a son, Amadeus. They announced their separation in 2018. Becker, who has lived in the UK since 2012, continued to make headlines with reports of financial trouble after he was declared bankrupt in 2017. Earlier this month he was convicted of flouting the terms of the bankruptcy. Becker was found guilty of transferring hundreds of thousands of pounds from his business account and failing to declare a property in his home town of Leimen, Germany. The BBC commentator was also convicted of hiding an 825,000 euro (almost PS700,000) bank loan and 75,000 shares in a tech firm. The Insolvency Service has confirmed Becker is still an undischarged bankrupt and will stay that way until October 2031. The court was also told today that Becker has 'fallen from grace' and 'will have to rely on the charity of others to survive'. He has suffered 'public humiliation' and has 'no future' following his conviction for hiding assets from the Insolvency Service, his barrister said. He added that his actions were a tragedy, destroying a 'glittering' career and has left him with 'literally nothing'. Mitigating today, Jonathan Laidlaw QC, said: 'I submit, and I hope this is not an exaggeration, Boris Becker has literally nothing and there is nothing to show for what was the most glittering of sporting careers. 'That is nothing short of a tragedy. His fall is not simply a fall from grace but amounts to the most public of humiliations for this man. 'His degree of suffering is punishment at a level that no other bankrupt in this country is likely to experience. So in terms of the defendant's future, in reality there is not one. 'These proceedings have destroyed his career, removed any future prospect of him earning any income and his brand is in tatters. He won't be able to find work and will have to rely on the charity of others if he is to survive.' Earlier the court heard he was in 'desperate financial straits' and chose who to give money to rather than the trustees in charge of his bankruptcy. His lawyer has said that he transferred money to 'settle debts' and 'meet his obligations' to his ex-wife and estranged wife. He also said Becker now has 'nothing' and 'nothing to show for what was the most glittering of sporting careers'. The court heard the original bankruptcy including the British private bank Arbuthnot Latham was PS49,181,724. Excluding the bank, it was PS40,067,065. What has been realised to date is PS3.184million. Mr Laidlaw QC said: 'He was in desperate financial straits and what in essence he has done and this is the basis of his culpability. 'He has exercised his own choice to which creditors to pay choosing or preferring to pay monies to dependents allowing than allowing the trustees to choose how that money can be applied. 'That is a criminal offence, but...this is a very different basis for sentence than has been contended before.' He added: 'Would those payments out to others necessarily been disallowed by the trustee in bankruptcy? 'Against this background plainly the defendant had to continue to support his ex-wife and that would have been consistent with the orders of the court. 'He was estranged from his then-wife and furthermore with the consent of the joint trustees he had been allowed to continue to work. Almost all of the money falls into those categories. 'I accept the point you make, and hope the court would also accept, that it is preference the defendant is exercising which is plainly not something he should have done but those payments may have been approved by the trustee in bankruptcy. 'We're not concerned about the money being spent on a lavish lifestyle or gambling or something like that.' Mr Laidlaw also invited the judge to reject that Becker got a mortgage on a house in order to stop creditors from seizing it. He said: 'I invite you to reject in round terms the loan, the mortgage, was sought with bankruptcy in mind. That is a submission that must fail. 'The evidence was the loan was granted on 27 March. That was a month before the petition was presented and two months before he was served with the petition on 28 May. It couldn't have been a device that the prosecution is suggesting.' His mitigating lawyer also rejected the prosecutor's claim that Becker concealed or sought to conceal up to PS2 million. Boris Becker spent what could be his last day of freedom browsing Harrods and visiting an unknown woman in her council flat. The three-time Wimbledon champion, 54, was photographed in Knightsbridge, Paddington and Notting Hill yesterday ahead of today's sentencing for a PS2.5million bankruptcy scam. Wearing a grey jacket and a baseball cap, he was spotted taking a taxi to a council estate in Bayswater, west London, to visit a woman before emerging 90 minutes later to go shopping in Harrods - where a guard ushered him in through a side entrance. On Wednesday, Becker was embraced by his girlfriend as he took a cigarette break during a meeting with documentary maker George Chignell in London. Last weekend, he was pictured with estranged wife Lilly and their 12-year-old boy in south London before the father and son met up with his current girlfriend, Lilian de Carvalho Monteiro.  Mr Laidlaw said: 'It is about 200,000 euros and not at the much higher figure. Most importantly however is about the court's assessment of liability. It is the court's judgement is that has these had been declared of the intention of the money it is likely this would have been permitted.' He continued: 'There is no evidence of premeditation of the defendant to commit Insolvency Act offences. It is in the evidence of the acquittals and it is clear that he never contemplated to be made bankrupt at all. 'The reality is the defendant's finances were a mess. They were chaotic. It is not until mid-July, a month or so into the bankruptcy, that count 4 occurred. 'There is no evidence of preparation of planning. He told his advisors about Schilling, the loan, and the shares, and if they had been included in the PIQB [preliminary information questionnaire for bankruptcy] he would not have found himself in this court.' Mr Laidlaw continued: 'He is not a defendant who brought about his bankruptcy with the intention of committing fraud. He was desperately seeking, however unrealistic he may have been, to avoid such event and he hoped to avoid such event. 'The culpability in our submission comes to this is he made choices to which debts to pay rather than allowing the joint trustees to make that decision.' He concluded his mitigation by saying: 'The defendant has lost literally everything. He has already paid an extremely heavy price in the mismanagement of his affairs in which he has no one to blame but himself. He added: 'Despite [Arbuthnot Latham] having been satisfied the defendant still finds himself subject to what is essentially an indefinite bankruptcy order. 'He has already suffered a heavy price due to the mismanagement of his affairs but also due to this offending. He has or will lose any interest in any other property or asset he has.' Becker had told jurors his $50million (about PS38 million) career earnings were swallowed up by an expensive divorce to his first wife Barbara Becker, child maintenance payments and 'expensive lifestyle commitments'.  The German national, who has lived in the UK since 2012, said he was 'shocked' and 'embarrassed' when he was declared bankrupt on June 21 2017 over an unpaid loan of more than PS3million on his estate in Mallorca. He claimed he had co-operated with trustees tasked with securing his assets, even offering up his wedding ring, and relied on the advisers who managed his life. However, Becker, who was supported in court by his partner Lilian de Carvalho Monteiro and eldest son, was found guilty of four charges. The court heard Becker received 1.13 million euros (about PS950,000) from the sale of a Mercedes car dealership he owned in Germany, which was paid into a business account used as a 'piggy bank' for his personal expenses. Becker was found guilty of transferring 427,00 euros (PS356,000) to nine recipients, including the accounts of his ex-wife Barbara and estranged wife Sharlely 'Lilly' Becker, the mother of his fourth child. He was further convicted of failing to declare a property in his home town of Leimen, hiding an 825,000 euro (almost PS700,000) bank loan on the house as well as 75,000 shares in tech firm Breaking Data Corp. Earlier this week Becker, who won tennis fans' hearts in the 1980s with his all-action style of play, was embraced by his girlfriend as he smoked during a break in a meeting with documentary maker George Chignell in London. Last weekend, he was pictured with Lilly and their 12-year-old boy in south London before the father and son met up with his current girlfriend.  Becker's mother Elvira Becker, 86, has begged a judge not to send her son to jail, saying earlier this month that he is 'a decent boy overall', adding: 'I hope my son doesn't have to go to prison.'  The German national, who has lived in the UK since 2012, claimed he had co-operated with trustees tasked with securing his assets, even offering up his wedding ring, and relied on the advisers who managed his life. However, Becker, who was supported in court by his partner Ms de Carvalho Monteiro and eldest son, was found guilty of four charges under the Insolvency Act by a jury at Southwark Crown Court on April 8. They include removal of property, two counts of failing to disclose estate and concealing debt. Judge Deborah Taylor released Becker on conditional bail ahead of sentencing today. The jury heard Becker received PS950,000 from the sale of a Mercedes car dealership he owned in Germany, which was paid into a business account. Prosecutor Rebecca Chalkley said he used the account as a 'piggy bank' for personal expenses, including PS7,600 on children's school fees, almost PS1,000 at Harrods, and payments made to Ralph Lauren, Porsche, Ocado and a Chelsea children's club. He was found guilty of transferring PS356,000 to nine recipients, including the accounts of his ex-wife Barbara and estranged wife Sharlely 'Lilly' Becker, the mother of his fourth child. Becker also paid PS40,000 for an ankle operation at a private clinic and spent PS5,000 at a luxury golf resort in China, the court heard. He was convicted of failing to declare a property in his home town of Leimen, hiding an PS700,000 bank loan on the house as well as 75,000 shares in tech firm Breaking Data Corp. But Becker was acquitted of a further 20 charges, including nine counts of failing to hand over trophies and medals from his tennis career. He told jurors he did not know the whereabouts of the memorabilia, including two of his three Wimbledon men's singles trophies, including the 1985 title that catapulted him to stardom, aged 17. The other prizes were his 1992 Olympic gold medal, Australian Open trophies from 1991 and 1996, the President's Cup from 1985 and 1989, his 1989 Davis Cup trophy and a Davis Cup gold coin which he won in 1988. Becker was cleared of failing to declare a second German property, as well as his interest in the PS2.5 million Chelsea flat occupied by his daughter Anna Ermakova, who was conceived during Becker's infamous sexual encounter with waitress Angela Ermakova at London restaurant Nobu in 1999. Giving evidence, he said he earned a 'vast amount' of money during his career, paying cash for a family home in Munich, a property in Miami, Florida, and the estate in Mallorca, which was worth about 50 million euros at the height of the property market. But Becker, who went on to coach current world number one tennis player Novak Djokovic, work as a TV sports commentator and act as a brand ambassador for firms including Puma, said his income 'reduced dramatically' following his retirement in 1999. He said he was involved in an 'expensive divorce' with ex-wife Barbara in 2001, involving high maintenance payments to their two sons, and had to support his daughter Anna and her mother, in a deal which included the Chelsea flat. Becker, who was resident in Monte Carlo and Switzerland before moving to the UK, said he had 'expensive lifestyle commitments,' including his PS22,000-a-month rented house in Wimbledon, south-west London. He also owed the Swiss authorities five million francs (about PS4 million) and separately just under one million euros (more than PS800,000) in liabilities over a conviction for tax evasion and attempted tax evasion in Germany in 2002. The court heard Becker's bankruptcy resulted from a PS3.85 million loan from private bank Arbuthnot Latham in 2013, and PS1.2million, with a 25 per cent interest rate, borrowed from British businessman John Caudwell, who founded Phones 4u, the following year. He said bad publicity had damaged 'brand Becker', meaning he struggled to make enough money to pay off his debts, while his QC Jonathan Laidlaw said at the time of his bankruptcy Becker was too 'trusting and reliant' on his advisers. Few spots stars have ever hit the height of Boris Becker's tennis careers - and none as young as the German ace. Born in Leimen, West Germany, in 1967, Becker, the son of an architect father and a Czech immigrant mother, was thrust into the world of tennis from a young age. His father founded a tennis centre in the town, where Becker honed his skills early on. By the age of 10, in 1977, he was a member of the junior team of the Baden Tennis Association. He went on to win the South German championship and the first German Youth Tennis Tournament.  After winning funding for training from the German Tennis Federation, he turned professional at 16 in 1984, winning the Tennis World Young Masters at the NEC in Birmingham in 1985, before claiming victory at Queens in June. Two weeks later, in July, aged 17, he entered Wimbledon as an unseeded player and took the tournament by storm, beating Kevin Curren by four sets in the final.  At just 17 years and 228 days old he became the youngest men's singles champion at SW19 - and immediately became a household name. The following year he defend his title, beating then world number one Ivan Lendl to secure back-to-back Wimbledon titles. He appeared in 77 finals and won 49 singles titles during his 16 years as a tennis pro. But by 1993, facing criticism over his marriage to wife Barbara and tax problems with the German government, had caused Becker to slide into a severe mid-career decline. In 1997, Becker lost to Sampras in the quarterfinals at Wimbledon. After that match, he vowed that he would never play at Wimbledon again. However he returned one more time to the prestigious west London tennis club, in 1999, this time losing in the fourth round to Patrick Rafter. Off the court, his personal troubles continued. He had to pay PS2.4million after he fathered a daughter, named Anna, with a Russian model while married to wife Barbara. That incident took place after he crashed out of Wimbledon to Rafter in 1999 and decided to retire from the sport, aged 31. Becker, in his 2003 autobiography, Stay A Moment Longer, revealed how he 'cried my eyes out' and felt the need to go out for a few beers with friends. However his then wife Barbara, seven months' pregnant with their second son, wanted him to stay at their hotel with her.  'She couldn't and wouldn't understand that she suddenly wasn't first in my priorities,' said Becker.  'I said, 'Just once more with the lads, Barbara, just once more to say farewell and then it's only you'. That didn't work. We rowed for two whole hours. Suddenly she was in pain and decided to check into hospital.; Becker said he told his wife to call him if the baby was really on the way, then hit the town. By 11pm he was at the bar in Mayfair's Nobu and spotted Russian model Angela Ermakowa. The pair had sex on the staircase in the London outpost.  The following February his secretary handed him a fax in his Munich office. It read: 'Dear Herr Becker, We met in Nobu in London. The result of that meeting is now eight months old.'  He later split from his first wife Barbara Feltus, a divorce which is estimated to have cost him more than PS15million, as well as their home in Miami.  Becker found a new post-tennis purpose soon after, joining the BBC for its annual coverage of Wimbledon - to great success. But his personal problems continued. He had a short engagement to Alessandra Meyer-Wolden in 2008, before announcing that he and Dutch model Sharlely 'Lilly' Kerssenberg would marry in 2009. After nine years of marriage, and a child, Becker's fourth, the pair split in 2018.  A year earlier, Becker had been declared bankrupt in June 2017 over an unpaid loan of more than PS3million on his estate in Mallorca, Spain. His former business partner, Hans-Dieter Cleven, also claimed that the former tennis ace owed him more than PS30million - though the case that was rejected by a Swiss court. Now Becker faces another bump in the road - perhaps the most serious yet - after being found guilty of four counts relating to the Insolvency Act earlier this month. He faces up to seven years in prison - with his freedom now left hanging in the balance ahead of his sentencing tomorrow.",
  "0a067ae6f4875b22e7b8538f344be161f623d3e1560e63a9beefcd3a": "One of Daniel Andrews' best known pandemic-era aides, Covid Commander Jeroen Weimar, is expected to be appointed to an important new role - but the rumour has been met with less than unanimous approval.  Mr Weimar, who became an unlikely sex symbol as he presided over Victoria's day-to-day handling of Covid, is expected to be announced as the CEO of the organising committee for the 2026 Commonwealth Games in the state. The $500,000-a-year appointment is set to be announced as early as next week, the Herald-Sun reports.  But not everyone is enthusiastic about the news, with the paper reporting some sporting figures feel Mr Weimar's role in shutting down sport in Victoria for two years makes him unsuitable for the role.    'He, alongside Brett Sutton and Daniel Andrews, lectured us for two years and tried to kill off sport in this state,' a 'sporting insider' was quoted as saying. 'I'm not sure sport wants him anywhere near the Games. Especially when you look at him, and his experience.' Another source characterised the appointment as a 'reward' for Mr Weimar's role in policing the stringent public health measures introduced by Victoria during the pandemic, and wondered whether his renowned logistics expertise would overcome the fact he was 'starting from a long way behind'. Mr Weimar announced he would quit his Covid commander post last week as  Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews continued to wind back the state's pandemic measures, including mandatory masks and vaccinated economy rules.  He had been responsible for the coordination of the state's testing, tracing and vaccination schemes .  Mr Weimar had been in the Covid coordination role since July 2020, after the state's hotel quarantine debacle, and said he would take time off before returning to the public service later in the year. Upon his appointment, Mr Weimar and Victoria's top doctor, Brett Sutton, were hailed as 'sex symbols' by some quarters of the population.  His resignation from the role came after announcements the bulk of pandemic rules in Australia's two biggest states' would be scrapped, including abolishing close-contact isolation requirements.  Victoria was only announced as the venue for the games in early April. The state will host a 'decentralised' event with regional hubs including Geelong, Bendigo, Ballarat and Gippsland among the venues for 16 sports.  'This will be a Commonwealth Games like no other. We promised we wouldn't be doing a re-run of 2006, as successful as that was,' Premier Daniel Andrews said at the time of the announcement.  'This is also about creating jobs, some nearly 4,000 jobs during the Commonwealth Games and some 3,000 enduring jobs thereafter.'  The 2026 games will mark the sixth time the event has been held in Australia following the games in Sydney, 1938, Perth in 1962, Brisbane in 1982, Melbourne in 2006, and the Gold Coast in 2018. ",
  "5441d80300a481fd48e8dd737b42eaa7cd1d8034f283d4f01a0ac325": "One of Hollywood's most powerful men last night publicly admonished the actor Will Smith for his infamous 'Oscars slap' sending the clearest signal yet that the disgraced superstar's career could be over. Speaking at the Simon Wiesenthal Center's national tribute dinner, Jeffrey Katzenberg - former head of Walt Disney Studios and the founder of DreamWorks Studios - told a crowd of 700 Tinseltown heavyweights: 'Unfortunately intolerance continues to be on the rise no matter where we look.  'We see it vividly on display whether it be far off on the battlefields of Ukraine or right here in Hollywood on the stage of the Dolby Theatre (home of the Oscars).' Men In Black star Smith stormed onto the stage at the Dolby during last month's Oscars ceremony and slapped Chris Rock after the comedian joked about Jada Pinkett Smith's hair. An enraged Smith screamed 'keep my wife's name out of your f****** mouth'. It later emerged Jada suffers from the hair loss condition alopecia. Smith, who won the Best Actor Oscar moments after his outburst for 'King Richard', was later banned from the Oscars for ten years and several of his film projects have been delayed or cancelled as his career hangs in the balance. Last night an executive with a major Hollywood studio told MailOnline: 'Jeffrey Katzenberg is one of the most powerful and revered men in Hollywood. For him to publicly condemn Will Smith at such a prestigious event is a big deal. It means Hollywood isn't ready to forgive or forget. It definitely sends the signal that Smith's career is on life-support.' A smiling Smith was photographed last weekend in India where he is believed to be staying at an ashram run by a spiritual guru who teaches 'self-transformation.' Thursday night's gala - the first major Hollywood event since the Oscars - was attended by a host of stars including James Corden, Will.i.Am, LL Cool J and Maroon 5's Adam Levine and virtually every Hollywood studio head. The Simon Wiesenthal Center is named after the famous Nazi hunter and is one of the most revered and prestigious human rights organizations in the world. Co-chairs of the event included Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones, producers Jerry Bruckheimer (Pirates of the Caribbean) and Ron Howard (The Da Vinci Code) and JJ Abrams (who directed the last three Star Wars movies.) A source said: 'The Wiesenthal event is attended by those who hold the power in Hollywood; studio bosses, producers, all the big agents. The feeling in the room was very much that Smith's career won't recover.' The gala raised $3.7 million for the Museum of Tolerance which commemorates victims of the Holocaust. Ukrainian President Zelensky was awarded the Center's Medal of Freedom. Apple's senior vice president of services Eddy Cue was given the organization's highest honor, the Humanitarian Award. Late-night talk show host James Corden, who was master of ceremonies, joked about being picked to host the event saying: 'Of course it makes sense for me to be here because it's almost impossible to find a Jewish comedian in Hollywood. Naturally one of the world's most prominent Jewish organizations has turned to me, a lapsed Protestant from High Wycombe.' He also took a jibe at Smith saying: 'Everyone is so happy that we are back being able to meet in person together again - except maybe Chris Rock.' Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder and CEO of the Simon Wiesenthal Center (SWC), said if Wiesenthal, who survived concentration camps and devoted his life to tracking down Nazis, was alive today (he died in 2005) 'He would be shocked that England, the country that led the charge against Hitler, just released findings that at least three anti-Semitic crimes are committed in the country every single day, forcing Jewish-owned bakeries and restaurants to close their stores on Holocaust Memorial Day for fear of being targeted.  As Winston Churchill reminded us: 'Strength is granted to us when we are needed to serve great causes. This is such a time. Let us act!'",

The NBA cited Butler's 'obscene gesture' as offensive and hit the forward with a hefty fine after Game 5 in the Eastern Conference Wednesday.  Butler was seen on the sidelines next to teammate Max Strus celebrating the Heat's 10-0 streak by suggestively thrusting his hips back and force. He did so while curling his lip at the camera, with less than two minutes to go in the second quarter.  The team itself also got slapped with a $15,000 for making the clip into a GIF - a short animate image. The team's account has since deleted the post, but the footage is still circling social media.  Butler, who was dressed in all black, did not participate in the game due to a knee injury, but watched from the bench as the team won 97-94 against the Atlanta Hawks at the FTX Arena on Thursday.  This is the player's third fine this season, bringing his total loss to $70,000, according to NBC Miami.   In November, he was fined $30,000 during a Denver-Miami game for allegedly trying to escalate an altercation. He also got a $25,000 fine in February for violating media interview access rules, according to NBC Miami.  NBA legend LeBron James was also fined $15,000 for an 'obscene gesture' in November after he did what has been dubbed the 'big balls' dance, where a man hops back and forth on their feet and gesture toward their private area. 'Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James has been fined $15,000 for making an obscene gesture on the playing court and warned for using profane language during media availability in response to league imposed discipline,' the NBA wrote at the time.  The Miami Heat will play again on Monday in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals. ",
  "58aef159ae0517a8a0a4996e99be875c56364fd9072bd7befd6d695f": "Johnny Depp's bodyguard has described noticing injuries and marks on the actor's face as his marriage to Amber Heard got increasingly more volatile.    Malcolm Connolly took the stand in the Hollywood star's defamation trial against his ex-wife Thursday, telling the court he witnessed his client go from being happy in love to 'quiet' as Heard became more 'dominant' and 'demanding.'   Testifying remotely from his native UK, Connolly, who began working as Depp's private personal security in 2006, said: 'At the beginning [it was] all lovey-dovey. Everything was great. Honeymoon period was on, and yeah it was good.' 'It was great to see Johnny happy again. Amber was lovely, charming - as she usually is - and good as gold.'  But Connolly, who identifies as a 'protection officer', said things then 'started to change' between the two spouses who began arguing more often.  'Amber started to change. Amber started getting a bit more feisty, demanding. I could see that Amber wanted to wear the pants in this relationship. That was pretty obvious,' he said.  The bodyguard added that Heard 'could get frosty at the drop of hat' and over time witnessed Depp 'getting quieter' as Amber 'started getting grumpy.' Connolly admitted that he never did see any physical violence between the two, but testified that he could hear Depp and Heard arguing often.  'I could hear Amber screaming. I could hear shouting and bawling,' he said, adding that he could 'mostly' hear Heard shouting and that the couple fought 'more often than not.'  And while he never witnessed any violence, the security guard told the court that he eventually began noticing scratches and injuries on Depp's face. He noted that he never saw any marks on Heard.   'What I noticed straight away was most of these marks were happening on the left hand side of his (Depp's) face,' Connolly said.  'There would be scratches on his neck. Maybe a fat lip in the corner, a bruising in the eye socket.  'It was getting more regular. Not every week, but it was definitely happening,' he added.   The jury was then shown a photo taken by Connolly on Depp and Heard's honeymoon in 2013.   Depp, posing alongside his now ex-wife and three others, appeared to have visible injuries and 'swelling' on his face.  When asked to described the photo, Connolly pointed the 'swelling on the left hand side' of Depp's nose and 'under his left eye.' Asked what he thought had happened, the bodyguard said: 'Either he's walked into a door, or a door has walked into him,' prompting laughter from the courtroom.  Earlier on Thursday, jurors also heard briefly from Depp's business manager, Ed White, who said he intervened in 2016 to resolve financial difficulties for Depp, including unpaid taxes and a cash crunch.  When he blamed Heard for an excessive wine bill that featured multiple $500 bottles of Spanish Vega Sicilia wine, Heard's lawyers responded with a barrage of questions over Depp's spending excesses, including spending millions of dollars to shoot journalist Hunter S. Thompson's ashes out of a cannon.   The court also heard testimony revealing that Elon Musk covered nearly half of ex-girlfriend Amber Heard's donation to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) after she pledged to give away her multimillion dollar divorce settlement to charity following her split from Depp.  The actress has so far only paid $1.3million of the $3.5million she promised the ACLU nearly six years ago, with Musk's money making up a large chunk of it. The billionaire Tesla founder, 50, gave $500,000 to the civil rights group on behalf of Heard after the two began dating after her divorce from Depp in 2016.  The Aquaman star, 36, announced she would donate the $7million she received in her settlement to two organizations when the couple's legal separation was finalized in August 2016. Heard promised to give half the money to the ACLU to support its work in 'fighting violence against women', and the other $3.5million to the Children's Hospital in Los Angeles.  But Terence Dougherty, the ACLU Chief Operating Officer and General Counsel, testified in the trial Thursday, telling the court the organizations' promised donation has not been paid in full yet. Dougherty said that so far only a total of $1.3million has either been paid by Heard or on her behalf. Of that money, Heard contributed $350,000 directly, while $100,000 was paid by Depp and another $350,000 came from a fund at Fidelity, an investment company. Another $500,000 payment came from an account at investment firm Vanguard, which Dougherty said he 'believed it was a fund set up by Elon Musk.' Asked by one of Depp's lawyers if there were messages with Musk about it, Dougherty said there were. He said there was a document and emails they had produced to the lawyers in the case regarding the money. Dougherty said that based on emails with Musk, the ACLU understood that Heard's $3.5million donation would be given over 10 years. He said that Heard's money was considered a 'pledge' so rather than a check all at once, it would come over time. Heard's lawyers have previously told the court that she fully intends to pay the money but for now needs the divorce settlement to pay her legal fees. The court heard that Heard's last donation of $350,000 in December 2018 and that she had not paid any money since. Dougherty said that Heard had told the organization that money was from her anonymous account with Fidelity but they did not do any further checks to guarantee it was her money. One of Depp's lawyers asked Dougherty what 'efforts the ACLU has made to get Amber Heard to pay'. He replied: 'We reached out to Miss Heard starting in 2019 for the next installment of her giving and we learned she was having financial difficulties'. The court heard that Musk played a central role in setting up Heard's donations to the ACLU, partly because he had given to it before. In an email dated August 18, 2016, Musk wrote to Heard and Anthony Romero, the executive director of the ACLU: 'I described your (Heard's) plan to donate $3.5million to the ACLU over the next 10 years as you very much believe in what they're doing'. The court heard that Robin Shulman, a communications strategist with the ACLU wrote the first draft of the op-ed in November 2018, a month before the article was published. In a message to Heard dated November 29, 2018, Shulman said that she tried to 'gather your fire and rage' and shape it into an op-ed piece. Asked if that meant rage against Depp, Dougherty said it was about 'gender-based violence issues'. In a follow up message, Shulman told Heard: 'Our lawyers should review this for the way I skirted around your marriage'. Jessica Weitz, another member of the ACLU communications team, told Heard: 'I want to make sure nothing was said in here that puts you in jeopardy with your NDA' with Depp after the divorce. Shulman and Heard met in person and that op-ed was changed, the court heard. Heard's lawyers also made some edits. One of Depp's lawyers asked Dougherty: 'Some at the ACLU expressed belief that excising references to the marriage and divorce from Johnny Depp made the op-ed less impactful?' Dougherty said: 'That is correct'. Dougherty said that the ACLU had the responsibility of placing the op-ed and considered the New York Times, Washington Post, Teen Vogue and USA Today as places where it could go. As Dougherty put it, the list was in 'descending importance and reach as we go down', but with a greater likelihood they would publish it. Gerry Johnson, one of the ACLU communications team, emailed his colleagues about timing the op-ed so it would come out at the same time as the premiere of Aquaman, the film Heard was starring in. Johnson wrote: 'Since draft turned out pretty strong and Aquaman slated to do large numbers I'm wondering what you think about it?' Dougherty said that media outlets were more likely to take on an op-ed if it had 'strong views' and the more the person was in the public eye at the time, the 'more likely it will be accepted by a more prominent media outlet'. Depp's lawyers asked Dougherty if Heard's marriage to Depp made the op-ed a 'stronger product'. Dougherty said: 'Amber's contributions to the portion of op-ed that talks about personal experiences is what informed the view this was a strong op-ed'. One of Depp's lawyers asked: 'She wanted the op-ed to come out just after Aquaman release?' Dougherty said: 'I recall there was a conversation for optimal timing' Dougherty added that it was 'correct' that Heard wanted the article to come out just after the Aquaman release. On December 11 2018, Witz emailed her colleagues that Heard's team had sent back a final draft but it 'neutered much of her marriage and domestic violence'. Witz said that the goal was the 'get this out this week to capitalize on the tremendous campaign for Aquaman', referring to the publicity surrounding the film. In follow up emails, Witz said that Heard wanted to get a mention of her getting a restraining order back into the article. Witz said: 'Is there an artful way to to do that?' Such a mention did not make it into the final cut. Around that time, Stacey Sullivan, another member of the ACLU's communications pitched the the article to Michael Duffy, an editor at the Washington Post. The email said: 'Hey Michael, wondering if we might interest you in an op-ed by Amber Heard 'Who as you may recall was beaten up during her brief marriage to Johnny Depp' Once it had been agreed the article would be published, Heard emailed her team and the ACLU: 'It's going to the Washington Post!!!' The court also heard about the panic within the ACLU how in 2019 Reuters inquired about how much Heard had paid of her $3.5m pledge. In an email to colleagues, Witz insisted that Heard had 'donated her full settlement to charity' but investigations revealed she had only paid $1.3m As Witz and her colleagues struggled to phrase a statement to Reuters, she emailed her colleagues: 'I had nightmares about this last tonight, do you think this is OK?' Depp's lawyers asked if Witz was 'concerned the ACLU was not telling the truth? As Depp looked on and smiled, Dougherty said: 'She was doing everything she could to give a correct statement to the press'.",
  "fd764d58ed02ce3c8ad7d321d9a56d76b6ad5633305d72a3389164bf": "A former U.S. Marine was killed while fighting alongside Ukrainian forces after the private security firm he worked for sent him to war.  The family of Willy Joseph Cancel, 22, of Orange County New York, confirmed that the husband and father of a seven-month-old son had died in the Ukraine fighting Russian forces on Monday, CNN reported.  He is survived by his wife Brittany, who he married in July 2019, as well as the couple's seven month-old son Anthony.   Cancel's mother, Rebecca Cabrera, said her son was working for a private military contracting company when he agreed to take up a job to fight in the Ukraine following Russia's invasion in February.  'He wanted to go over because he believed in what Ukraine was fighting for, and he wanted to be a part of it to contain it there so it didn't come here, and that maybe our American soldiers wouldn't have to be involved in it,' Cabrera told CNN.  The circumstances of Cancel's death remain unclear, including how and where he was killed.  His mother added that those fighting alongside Cancel were not able to retrieve his body during the conflict that killed him.  'They haven't found his body,' she said. 'They are trying, the men that were with him, but it was either grab his body or get killed, but we would love for him to come back to us.'  The family said Cancel was living in Tennessee working as a corrections officer when he flew to Poland on March 12 and crossed into Ukraine.  Cabrera told CNN that her son was joined by men from 'all different countries' to assist the Ukrainian troops.  'It was something that he believed in his heart, that was the right thing,' Cabrera said. 'He was the type of man who always stepped up when everybody else stepped back, and there were a lot of men who were like that that were with him.' Cancel's brother-in-law, Devin Tietze, echoed Cabrera's remarks, saying that Cancel was the 'type to fight for what's right regardless of the outcome.'  'He believed wholeheartedly this shouldn't have happened and he wanted to go help the people in Ukraine,' Tietze told CNN. The U.S. State Department said they were aware of the reports of Cancel's death but could not comment based on privacy matters.  The Department reiterated in a statement that: 'US citizens should not travel to Ukraine due to the active armed conflict and the singling out of US citizens in Ukraine by Russian government security officials, and that US citizens in Ukraine should depart immediately if it is safe to do so, using any commercial or other privately available ground transportation options.'  It is not known how many U.S. citizens are actively assisting Ukrainian troops in the war, but the Ukrainian Defense Ministry estimates that more than 20,000 volunteer veterans from 52 countries have joined the fight.  The influx of foreign fighters has led the Ukranian government to create the special International Legion, composed of the visiting veterans allied with the country.   Cancel is not the first American to die in the Ukraine as a result of the bloody war.  Jimmy Hill, 67, of Idaho, was gunned down in the streets of Ukraine while buying bread when he refused to leave the warzone because he was looking after his sick partner.  Hill was a lecturer in Kyiv but was in Chernihiv to care for his partner Ira, who has multiple sclerosis. They had returned to the country in December so Ira, who is Ukrainian, could be treated for MS, and became trapped at a regional hospital there.   Hill was among a group of 10 who were lining up to buy bread at a grocery store when Russian troops opened fire in a sickening act of war. Hill's death came just a few days after American journalist and freelance filmmaker Brent Renaud, 50, was shot dead by Russian troops while filming refugees in the Ukraine.  Renaud was in a car with other journalists in Irpin when Putin's troops opened fire. He was fatally-shot in the neck, with one of his colleagues also injured.  Although Renaud was carrying a New York Times press badge at the time of his death, he was in fact working as a freelancer on a global film about refugees commissioned by Time magazine's studio division. Renaud's death was announced by Andrey Nebitov, the head of Kyiv's police department, who said he paid 'with his life for trying to highlight the aggressor's ingenuity, cruelty and ruthlessness.' ",
  "b354eb282615529f1fdea4dadda841e3fcb955cd7fd271be78c0eca9": "A Colorado prison inmate has contracted H5N1 bird flu at a poultry farm where he was placed as part of a pre-release work program.  The unnamed inmate, who is under 40, contracted the bird flu - known medically as avian influenza - at Foster Farms after being directly exposed through culling, the Montrose Press and the CDC reported.  The only symptom he reported was 'fatigue for a few days' and has since recovered. However, the CDC reported he is still be isolated and treated with the influenza antiviral drug oseltamivir.  The Colorado Department of Agriculture said the virus was detected after a single nasal swab and after repeat testing, he came back negative. All employees at the farm were provided personal protective equipment and they have tested negative.  In order to control the outbreak, Foster Farms had to euthanized 60,000 chickens and parts of Montrose and Delta Counties has been put under a quarantine, which restricts poultry growers from moving birds, eggs, and manure off their properties, the Montrose Press reported.  This is the only case of this specific strain of H5 that the US has seen and only the second in the world. The first case was found in the UK in December 2021 in a man who was asymptomatic.  'This case does not change the human risk assessment for the general public, which CDC considers to be low,' the agency said in a press release. However, those who work poultry should take 'appropriate precautions,' it said, which includes avoiding sick or dead birds.  Also known as avian influenza, bird flu is an infectious disease of birds caused by a variant of the standard influenza A virus.   Bird flu is unique in that it can be transmitted directly from birds to humans.  There are 15 different strains of the virus. It is the H5N1 strain which is infecting humans and causing high death rates.  Humans can catch bird flu directly through close contact with live infected birds and those who work with infected chickens are most at risk.    An epidemiologist at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment agreed, telling the Montrose Press: 'We want to reassure Coloradans that the risk to them is low.'  More than 2,500 Americans have been exposed to the virus over the years, but this is the only case to so-far have been identified during the latest outbreak.  The virus is unlikely to spread person-to-person.  The disease has been found in backyard birds in 29 states and in wild birds in 34 states, the CDC reported. It is, however, safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry and poultry products found in the US, the CDC said, as heat will kill the virus.  Some symptoms of the disease, which can range from mild to severe, are: eye infection, upper respiratory symptoms, and pneumonia.  China reported the world's first ever human case of the H3N8 bird flu strain this week.  A four-year-old boy from Zhumadian, in the Henan province, tested positive for the avian influenza strain, local health chiefs confirmed. The child -- who had a fever -- had been in contact with chickens and crows raised at his home. None of the boy's close contacts were infected with the strain. The H3N8 variant -- one of several types of bird flu -- is common in horses and dogs and has even been found in seals. Yet no human cases had been reported until now. ",
  "6b3c6b73b2da3ad36fec605ed8657c92a1fd7e4b8f77dd1791301b55": "Most Australians believe two-up can only be played in pubs and clubs on Anzac Day but there are other occasions the coins can be tossed legally.  While rules vary from state to state, the game can also be played in New South Wales on Victory in the Pacific Day (August 15) and Remembrance Day (November 11) - but only after noon. The former marks the defeat of the Japanese in World War II in 1945 and the later the end of World War 1 in 1918.  A further exemption under the Gambling (Two-up) Act 1998 allows two-up in Broken Hill all year around because of the far western NSW town's historic association with the game.   Thousands of punters flocked to pubs and clubs after the restrictions on two-up were further loosened for this year's Anzac Day. NSW temporarily extended the exemption to the entire long weekend.  The one-off initiative aimed to give back to veterans who missed out during the Covid-19 pandemic at the biggest Anzac Day commemoration since 2019.   Victoria's Gambling Regulation Act 2003 permits the conduct of two-up on Anzac Day - or in the seven days leading up to April 25 - at any RSL club, sub-branch or other venue used by the veterans' organisation. Queensland allows two-up to be played in an RSL club on Anzac Day or 'another day that is significant to the remembrance of the sacrifice for the nation by the men and women of its Defence Force.' In South Australia, the game is 'not unlawful' when played on Anzac Day on premises occupied by the RSL or the Defence Force. Two-up can only be played in Tasmania on Anzac Day, between 6am and 6pm, and permits can be sought in Western Australia for games on Anzac Day and August 18 - Vietnam Veterans' Day.  Western Australia also permits two-up at country race clubs more than 100km from the Crown Perth casino. It can only be played on race days.   The Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory allow two-up to be played on Anzac Day.    Australian soldiers regularly played two-up in trenches and on troopships during World War I but it was already popular among convicts in the late 18th century and on the goldfields of the 1850s.  Veterans continued to play the game when they returned home from war until it was eventually banned by the NSW government in 1981. Other states followed suit several years later.  The game involves a designated 'spinner' who throws two pennies into the air as players bet on whether the coins will land on heads or tails.  These rules can be used to govern the playing of Two-up, but are not mandatory. The decision of the ringkeeper will be final The ringkeeper shall select a spinner by offering the kip clockwise around the ring and shall hand the kip to the first person who accepts it There shall be two sets of seven pennies held by the ringkeeper. The spinner shall select two pennies from one of the sets, thrown down inside the ring by the ringkeeper Only two pennies shall be used A change of pennies shall be at the discretion of the ringkeeper The tail side of pennies will be marked with a white cross The spinner shall place pennies tails up on the kip The spinner shall select two other pennies from the remaining five of the set after throwing three consecutive pairs of heads. The ringkeeper shall retain the winning two pennies and throw down the balance of the set for the spinner to make the selection The spinner cannot take a dividend before three consecutive heads are thrown In the event that the spinner throws tails, the spinner shall lose the total of the moneys in the centre and the right to spin The ringkeeper shall declare a spin invalid by announcing 'no spin' or 'barred' Centre monies shall be set in full before any side bets may be made Only the spinner shall be permitted within the boundaries of the ring during play A spinner after throwing three consecutive pairs of heads may withdraw from the centre No person under the age of 18 years shall be permitted in that area of the Two-up premises where the game is being conducted while the game is being conducted and played Unseemly conduct or offensive language shall not be tolerated The spinner shall hand the ringkeeper the amount of money the spinner wishes to spin for, the ringkeeper shall hold that money and the equivalent amount from a tail bettor to cover the bet Source: Liquor and Gaming NSW",
  "72ed5afc1d3983230c3d513c70f46bd5d936b982f54d6ab25927bbc9": "An eshay has warned homeowners not to leave boxes for expensive gear outside their homes because it attracts thieves, telling them exactly what's in the house. The man, who refers to himself as Tyso in the tongue-in-cheek video, filmed himself walking down a quiet suburban street in western Sydney. He is seen wearing a bum bag over his shoulder and a white cap on his head, with a cigarette stuck to the side of his face.  He comes up to a heap of discarded and empty TV boxes, waiting to be picked up by garbage collectors - one being for a $1,600 Sony television.  'Oi, braz I'll tell you this right,' he says.  'Don't do this braz. Old mate here, big TV. You know what that says to me, braz? 'Big TV in there mate, you just bought it. I'll be back later on'. 'F**king Tyso's going to get himself a big Sony.' The eshay then points the camera to the boxes to reveal it is a 46 inch Sony Bravia TV/ He reads the Sony logo on the top: 'Sony. Make. Believe'. 'I believe it's going to be mine now, braz,' he says, in a tongue in cheek remark. 'Don't leave boxes out the front. It's f**king red hot.' The video was uploaded to Facebook where social media users were quick to agree with the eshay. Daily Mail Australia is not implying the man planned to steal the television, and was merely warning people on social media.  Eshays wear Nike TN trainers with polo shirts, puffer jackets, tracksuit pants or baggy shorts and baseball caps. Favoured labels include Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, and Lacoste, paired with Nautica, Adidas, Under Armour and Ellesse. Some eshays scramble words and put 'ay' on the end in a form of pig Latin. 'Eetswa' means 'sweet' and 'chill' becomes 'illchay'.  Hard-core eshays engage in assaults, robberies and threatening behaviour against other youths but many seem to wander the streets aimlessly.  'Tyso about to be watching daytime TV in luxury,' one person commented. Another person said: 'Keep an eye out for an LG OLED for me yeah?'. What is an Eshay?  Eshays prowl in packs, speaking their own mashed-up language as they strut around town in designer sportswear with a generally menacing attitude. But are eshays a serious threat to polite society or just the latest incarnation of disaffected youths wanting to stand out from the crowd by looking the same as each other? Whatever the motive for urban teenagers with bad haircuts donning Nike TNs and slinging bumbags over one shoulder, they are apparently overtaking the suburbs. Where eshays once predominantly came from disadvantaged backgrounds their ethos is now more mainstream and widely promoted on social media. An eshay is easily identifiable by the aforementioned TN trainers, worn with polo shirts, puffer jackets, tracksuit pants or baggy shorts and baseball caps. Favoured labels for the fashionable eshay include Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, and Lacoste, paired with Nautica, Adidas, Under Armour and Ellesse. He should give the impression he is looking to score drugs or moments away from robbing an innocent passerby of their belongings. Some eshays scramble words and put 'ay' on the end in a form of pig Latin. 'Eetswa' means 'sweet' and 'chill' becomes 'illchay'. The term eshay is similar to the UK phrase 'chav' and can be interchangeable with 'lad', which in turn sometimes becomes 'adlay'. 'Eshay' may have started as 'eshay adlay' - pig Latin for 'he's lad' or be related to 'sesh', for a prolonged period of drug consumption. When an eshay says 'eshay' it can mean yes, cool or excellent. Something high-risk is 'red hot' and an idiot is a 'gronk'. To 'staunch' someone is to intimidate them, often with an intense stare while the challenger's fists are held between their legs. Eshays are said to have spread from Sydney's inner-city graffiti scene in the 1980s through Housing Commission estates and out into the suburbs. Hard-core eshays engage in assaults, robberies and threatening behaviour against other youths but many seem to wander the streets and hang around train stations aimlessly. Some are said to 'roll' victims for their shoes and clothes but such crimes are not widely reported. While some eshays had domestic backgrounds of violence, poverty and drug or alcohol use, many were likely copying a look that suggested a criminal outlook. Their antics, which can include carrying weapons and taking drugs, are often filmed and posted on Tik Tok to widespread amusement. The drill rap of groups such as Mount Druit outfit OneFour is a popular accompaniment. Parents on Sydney's Northern Beaches have recently expressed concerns about anti-social behaviour of teens they describe as dressing like eshays. Dr Terry Goldsworthy, Associate Professor of Criminology at Bond University told the Telegraph eshays had become prominent in the past seven or so years. 'Like any subculture there are influencers on social media,' the onetime detective inspector said. 'It's monkey see, monkey do. 'A few years ago I'd never heard the term eshay, but I think social media has something to do with it.' Just like punks in the 1970s and 1980s the eshay will one day be replaced by another set of clothes and taste in music, with a new name and similar anti-authoritarian demeanour. 'Like any subculture, today's eshay will be tomorrow's nerd,' Dr Goldsworthy said.",

City News Kalgoorlie owners Tania and Kevin Parkes have accused local man Mark Ing of falsely claiming a $261,986 share in the eye watering stake in February. Some 250 people won the $63million jackpot after paying just $100 for a ticket.  The Parkes family have lodged a writ of summons in the Supreme Court of Western Australia. The development was first reported by PerthNow.  The pair allege that Mr Ing made 'untrue' claims to Lotterywest that he had bought a ticket in the winning No. Two Syndicate. The court document alleges Mr Ing had actually bought a ticket for the No. One Syndicate. He was able to make the claim after the owners of the news agency allowed him 'to present one of their tickets ... on the basis that the defendant's (alleged) ticket could be presented by mail'.  The couple claim he failed to send the appropriate ticket to Lotterywest, according to PerthNow. 'Despite a formal dispute of ownership filed by the plaintiffs with Lotterywest, Lotterywest informed the plaintiffs that it intended to disburse the winnings on their ticket to the defendant,' the document states.  Ms Parke declined to comment, when approached by Daily Mail Australia, as the matter was still before the court. The $63million draw marks one of the largest wins in Lotto history.  A single parent with four foster children and a pair of struggling business owners were among the winners.  The current titleholder for the largest jackpot winner is a Sydney nurse, who won more than $107 million in 2019.  The civil matter against Mr Ing will be heard before the court on August 2. ",
  "cc6611b9bf661d81f884177d799a3b8a3c70a857e30ced154d2dce65": "A woman has been rushed to hospital after she was attacked by a kangaroo at a golf club.  Emergency services said the marsupial scratched the 69-year-old at Arundel Hills Country Club in the Gold Coast just after 9am on Friday morning.  The woman may need stitches on her jaw after suffering multiple lacerations to her face, as well as her arms and legs. She also sustained injuries to her head and was taken by ambulance to Pindara Private Hospital in a stable condition. The 69-year-old was reportedly attacked behind by the large animal, who kicked her and knocked her to the ground. Queensland Ambulance Service operations supervisor Joel McEwan said upon hitting the ground the woman was stomped on by the kangaroo several times.  'The patient was quite upset at the scene -- obviously it's a shock being attacked by quite a large kangaroo,' he said.  Kangaroos have been known to visit the Arundel Hills Country Club. Last year amazing footage surfaced of a mob of kangaroos parking themselves on the green near where a golfer was teeing off.",
  "ef27400fa83937d1b97fe7233293f9d24d5e8618082942599a0d9ef4": "The devastated son of an elderly man ruthlessly beaten to death has spoken of the horror of cleaning his father's bloodied home after the attack. Emiliano Lombardi, 84, was killed by 29-year-old Quade Karsum Jones when he went on an hour-long crime spree, assaulting six other people in August, 2020 in Perth's east. A heavily intoxicated Jones tore off the side mirror from Mr Lombardi's car and smashed it over his head and face, leaving the grandfather with catastrophic injuries and soaked in blood. Jones was on Thursday sentenced to life behind bars in the West Australian Supreme Court and will be eligible for parole in 2043. In an emotional victim impact statement, Mr Lombardi's son Don detailed how losing his 'papa' had 'broken me as a man'. The 84-year-old spent two weeks in hospital but eventually asked his family to stop treatment and 'let me go'. 'Every part of these two weeks I will never forget and are permanently etched on my brain,' Don said in his statement. 'This experience broke me as a man and affected me to the core of my existence. My sister, brother and I held my dad for hours in his final hours to say it was going to be okay.' Don said adding to the trauma of losing his father was the task of cleaning his East Cannington home. 'Going to my dad's house to see blood everywhere was so private and personal and I remember not letting my wife come into the house - not wanting her to see the pain in the house and see my pain clearly on my face,' he said. 'Blood on every door, wall, floor and piece of furniture.  'I remember wanting to clean this house with my sister to clean the blood to erase the memory of the incident - trying to heal my dad as I was healing that house.' Mr Lombardi was Jones' fifth victim of the day on August 16, 2020. Jones' first victim was a man who had seen co-accused Joshua Cates spray graffiti on a bench. Cates was cleared of being an accessory to murder in December 2020, but ordered to do 40 hours of community service for graffiti during the crime spree.  Jones tried to confront the man but he got in his car and drove off, but had to later slow down when he came to an intersection.  Jones ran up to his car and started punching the passenger side window. He then opened the driver's door and punched and kicked the man. Jones tried to take the keys out of the ignition and in the process pulled off three keys which belonged to the man's partner. The man suffered swelling to his jaw and reported the incident. A short time later Jones saw a woman outside her home and proceeded to grab her hair and shake her head, after asking for cigarettes and money. She tried to run inside her home and screamed, alerting her two housemates to come outside. Upon seeing Jones they tried to close the front door on him but he forced his way inside and then attacked one of the housemates, punching him in the face, shoulder and chest. His fourth victim was a woman who Jones 'walloped' on the back of her body before attempting to throw a can at her as she walked down the street. Mr Lombardi, the fifth victim of the day, lived alone and was in good health at the time of his 'very severe and vicious assault'. After being beaten over the head and dripping with blood, Mr Lombardi was able to make his way inside his home and into his bed. Jones continued on his rampage of terror, going on to beat up another neighbour who was too terrified to run inside his home in case his attacker followed him and harmed his family. The 29-year-old then pulled a letterbox out of the ground and hurled it towards the man but it didn't connect. Jones then headed to a nearby train station and stole a beanie from a woman heading home. He then grabbed a nearby sign and started whacking her on her back, causing bruising before a passerby saw the assault and Jones fled the scene. Jones, who'd been using meth since he was 17, then took a train to Armadale where he visited a pub and stayed in the restroom for an hour.  Paper towels, soap and water were found all over the bathroom as Jones tried to clean any blood off of himself. Following Mr Lombardi's assault the elderly man suffered injuries to his brain and right eye, and fractures to his face and shoulder. In his sentencing, Justice Stephen Hall said there was no 'rational reason' for Jones' violent attacks. 'You attacked indiscriminately, anyone who had the misfortune to come into contact with you,' he said. 'The attacks in each case were shocking and frightening.' 'Despite the obvious severity of the injuries to Mr Lombardi, you made no effort to render him assistance. Rather, you left him alone and badly injured and continued on your way, attacking others as you went.'  Director of Public Prosecutions Amanda Forrester SC described called Jones' attack on Mr Lombardi as a 'very severe and vicious assault' and noted the innocent man was 'savagely beaten' in the head and face with the broken mirror. Defence lawyer Bernard Standish said Jones had no 'true memory' of the vicious attacks but was heavily intoxicated at the time.  There has been no suggestion that Jones suffers from a mental illness or a personality disorder that could have contributed to his cruel actions.  Jones was not arrested until four days after the attacks on August 20, 2020. By that time it was too late for police to test if Jones had any drugs in his system at the time of the events. Jones' lawyer has insisted he feels guilty for his actions and that Jones 'clearly didn't have an intention to kill'. 'He regrets it, it's behaviour he thinks about all the time and if he could take it back, he could,' he said. The court heard the attacks were not Jones' first case of intoxicated violence and that he had beat his father over the head with a coffee cup in 2016. Jones had initially pleaded his innocence and was set to face court in late February but changed his plea to guilty late last year. ",
  "6784a0e2f042b5ba92faa824ab09a936ad30ea311cae9d25a35e0b0a": "A disgraced property developer has agreed to pay $18.85 million to the family of a  woman struck and killed by his 17 year-old son doing 100mph in a Lamborghini he'd been bought for his birthday.  Brandon Khuri, the driver of the vehicle and the son of real estate mogul James Khuri, was racing the $200,000 Urus in a 35-mph zone on a West Los Angeles freeway, when he crashed into a Lexus driven by Monique Munoz, 32. The settlement, revealed on Thursday, is one of the largest amounts for a single plaintiff in a wrongful death case in California history, according to the family's lawyer.  Khuri was condemned as one of America's most irresponsible fathers after his son slaughtered Munoz. His killer son was sentenced to just seven to nine months in a juvenile camp, and four months probation. Astonishingly, the arrogant multi-millionaires even suggested Khuri be allowed to serve his sentence at home confinement inside their luxury mansion.   'Today is a significant milestone because the Munoz family can finally get some closure for this horrific tragedy,'' attorney Daniel Ghyczy said in a statement on Wednesday, NBC Los Angeles reported. He continued: 'It was never about money for the Munoz family, it was about the acknowledgment of Brendan Khuri's misconduct that resulted in the death of their only daughter and to ensure that he was held accountable. 'Today's settlement is a testament to their efforts and is a step closer to justice.'  He continued: 'The family faced numerous hurdles from both private insurance companies and the L.A. District Attorney's office, and experienced the harsh realities of racism and bias against those from underserved communities.'   The $18.8 million settlement is tied to a lawsuit filed last year in Los Angeles claiming that Chubb Insurance had discriminated against the Latina woman when calculating the wrongful-death claim award amount, the news outlet said.  Munoz, who had been driving home from her job at UCLA Health in Los Angeles, had been trapped in the wreckage following the crash and died at the scene, the LA Police Department said. She had been preparing to start law school.     On Wednesday, new video of the fatal crash was also released, which showed Khuri running a red light in his Lamborghini SUV before his vehicle slammed into the vehicle of Munoz, killing her.   In April, Khuri pleaded guilty to vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence in Inglewood Juvenile Court. Prosecutors were outraged when his defense argued that he should serve the majority of his sentence in probation at his family's mansion. Khuri's attorney, Mark Werksman, said the teen was diagnosed with autism, and attention deficit disorder following the crash, where they claimed he sustained brain injuries, the Los Angeles Times reported. Psychologist Karen Schiltz, who testified before the Los Angeles County Superior Court, said Khuri likely suffered from autism his entire life but was never diagnosed and that he would be 'victimized' if he were to be held in an LA County juvenile camp. Munoz's family believed Khuri's sentence was too lenient. In August protests were held over the case. Munoz's uncle, Richard Cartier, had called on the court to deny house arrest for the teen.       'I'm looking for this kid to actually get what he deserves,' Munoz's uncle Richard Cartier told ABC7.  'He murdered my niece and he had no remorse for any life of any kind and he showed it. The distraught family believes the teen is getting special treatment because of his father's wealth.   Khuri's father, James, is a multi-millionaire who owns several real estate firms and an e-commerce business. Despite Brendan's repeated apologies, the Munoz family have called for the teen take accountability for his crime.  Weeks before the deadly crash, the teen had put up social media posts about his racing and drifting activities in his luxury car that retails for a minimum of $218,000.  LA police officials testified that the teen had been cited twice for excessive speeding and had even had his license suspended over his antics in the Lamborghini. Munoz's stepfather, Isaac Cordona, 55, of Hawthorne, California, spoke of his heartbreak in an interview with DailyMail.com in a 2021 interview. His wife, Monique's mother Carol, 54, was too upset to speak to DailyMail.com but told of her heartbreak in a Facebook post on February 18. She wrote: 'My baby my life my everything my heart is broken in so many pieces mommy is going to miss you sooo much. 'I LOVE YOU FOREVER BABY FEELS LIKE A BAD DREAM RIP MY BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS.'              teen son of a multimillionaire -- who was driving a Lamborghini in excess of 100 mph -- have reached an $18 million settlement. Monique Munoz, a 32-year-old secretary from Hawthorne, died in February 2021 in West Los Angeles when the luxury car driven by the then-17-year-old son of real estate magnate James Khuri slammed into her Lexus, the Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday. The crash occurred during rush-hour traffic in a 35-mph zone when Munoz was driving home from her job at UCLA Health in Los Angeles, NBC Los Angeles reported. The $18.8 million settlement is tied to a lawsuit filed last year in Los Angeles claiming that Chubb Insurance had discriminated against the Latina woman when calculating the wrongful-death claim award amount, according to the newspaper.

Several Sydneysiders have shared pictures of the mass crowds at the airport on Friday. One woman said the line to get through international security was 'easily 300 metres long'. Another traveller said the queues were 'absolutely astonishing'. 'I'm 1/2 way now after almost an hour,' they tweeted with a picture of huge line of travellers in front of them. One man said on Friday morning there were just five out of 13 security checkpoints open and the wait time was at least an hour long. 'You (Sydney Airport) really need to fix the security check-in and get your customer service back to where it was pre-pandemic. You will lose so many customers,' tweeted one fed up traveller.  'An hour and a half in the queue so far, still a couple of hundred people before security,' another said.  One disgruntled passenger said the airport was 'a s**t show with long lines and no staff.'  'How hard is it to provide some level of service.' Sydney Airport has been contacted for comment.  Earlier this month there were huge delays for travellers planning a trip for the start of school holidays with queues stretching to one kilometre long. Passengers complained of missing their flights while some claimed the long hold-up in the terminals was worsened by queue jumpers barging to the front of the lines.  Airport bosses blamed school holidays, a shortage of security personnel and, remarkably, forgetful passengers out of the habit of removing items from their luggage for scanning.  A spokesman told Daily Mail Australia: 'We're incredibly grateful to passengers for their ongoing patience and for treating each other and airport workers with kindness and respect. 'We have significant COVID-related staff shortages and we're also working to rebuild our workforce in a really tight jobs market. Unfortunately this is an industry-wide issue and airports and airlines around the world are experiencing similar challenges. 'Our advice to passengers is to arrive at their airport two hours prior to domestic flights, three hours prior to international, and prepare for security screening by taking laptops and aerosols out of hand luggage.' Widespread domestic air travel only recommenced earlier this year as states dropped Covid border restrictions as nationwide vaccination levels rose above 90 per cent. ",
  "e2efd339689913be5249abf543fca2b9c52b61b30b5163fb608d2448": "Bodybuilding champion Gary Lewer will be kicked out of Australia after a court bid to overturn his pending deportation was rejected. The former Mr Universe will be sent back to the UK, two years after Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton called for his deportation on character grounds. Mr Lewer, 66, accepted he had a substantial criminal record including receiving a conviction and prison sentence on weapons charges more than 25 years ago. He also has a 2004 conviction for selling steroids which was included in a police dossier that formed part of the basis for Mr Dutton's decision. Mr Lewer argued there had been no substantial change in his character since a visa was last granted to him in 2017, but police said they believe he is involved in a sophisticated criminal drug importation and manufacturing enterprise. He has never been convicted. Victoria Police claimed that was because he 'possesses sound knowledge of police investigation methodology, is extremely disciplined in his criminal conduct to avoid detection and therefore is an extremely difficult suspect to investigate'. Mr Lewer said their suspicion or belief was not evidence that could support Mr Dutton's assessment of him. But Federal Court judge Justice Bernard Murphy rejected the argument and upheld Mr Lewer's visa cancellation. Mr Lewer, a three-time world champion bodybuilder, left Britain at five and has never taken up Australian citizenship. Friends have previously described the deportation calls as 'unjust' and 'a result of a long standing vendetta' by Victoria Police. Mr Lewer is being held in immigration detention in Melbourne.",
  "6b9f803a3e46c5caad9e4a3bcd0248697228dc58942b83e83f12289b": "A mom who suffocated her baby while high on drugs then dumped his body in the trash has been stabbed to death by the infant's dad while awaiting trial, police say.   LaDonia Boggs, 39, was found unresponsive by police in the doorway of her DC apartment around 3am on Wednesday with 'an apparent stab wound.'  Police reported Carl Jones - who was father to the couple's late son Kyon Jones -  reportedly stabbed her during a 'domestic dispute,' authorities reported.  Jones was arrested and charged with second degree murder while armed, DC police said in a statement. No motive has been given, with Boggs and Jones linked by the notorious death of their baby son. Kyon went missing in early May 2021, aged just two months old.  Boggs was arrested in late May on counts of felony murder and evidence tampering in connection with the presumed death of her infant son, Kyon Jones.  She is said to have been high on a drug called angel dust when she accidentally smothered Kyon. Boggs claimed she then dumped her son's body in the trash. Despite extensive searches of local landfill sites, his remains have never been found.   The murder charge was later dropped, but she was still awaiting trial for evidence tampering after the baby's remains were unable to be found.  Boggs' told authorities she accidentally rolled on top of her son while under the influence of angel dust, a hallucinogenic drug also known as PCP.  'He was asleep on my chest and when I woke up, he wasn't breathing anymore, because he was just that small. He was only 2 months old. He was a premature baby, she said, according to NBC Washington.  The mother said she headed outside and went around the block 'a few times' before returning the her apartment to check on her son, who was still not breathing. 'I came back in the house and got a blanket and his car seat and wrapped it up and took it outside and just [threw] it in the trash,' she says haltingly. 'And that's what happened.' According to court documents, Boggs offered conflicting accounts of what happened to her son to the boy's father and the police. The woman initially told Kyon's biological father that the infant would be gone 'for a long time' because DC Child and Family Services took custody of him, but the agency denied having the baby. During an interview with the police that took place a day after Kyon was reported missing, Boggs reportedly admitted that he died while sleeping between her and a wall. Boggs said she woke up to find the infant unresponsive beneath her stomach. In a follow-up interview with the police, the mother was said to have admitted that she panicked and tossed Kyon's body in the trash while high on PCP and hallucinating. Boggs also said she did not know the whereabouts of Kyon's body. Surveillance video from Boggs' apartment complex showed her carrying a plastic bag, a cardboard box and a car seat to a dumpster. The box was described in court records cited by WTOP as being 'large enough to carry a 2-month-old infant.' Officers accompanied by cadaver dogs scoured a landfill in Virginia last week, but the missing boy was not located. The court documents noted that at the time of her arrest, Boggs retracted her statement concerning her alleged use of PCP at the time of Kyon's death, claiming that the last time she smoked the drug was a day or two prior. Boggs was released without bond to DC's Pretrial Services Agency following her arraignment on Saturday. She was due back in court on November 19.",
  "452fc5b952d29e0e93f626d0a7411e7d4416a77ee24b18807984283e": "Netflix has begun firing staff after missing its subscriber target by 200,000 people and watching the value of its shares tank by 50 per cent in a month.   The streamer made the layoffs at Tudum, a website filled with stories that are meant to market Netflix's programs.  At least 10-15 staff tweeted about being fired, although the exact number dismissed remains unclear.   The site, named as an onomatopoeia for the sound you hear when a Netflix show begins, was meant to allow subscribers insider access to the company's shows.    Netflix refused to tell the Los Angeles Times how many jobs were cut, merely saying  'our fan website Tudum is an important priority for the company.'  Some of those laid off took to Twitter, saying that the company had only hired them months earlier. Their dismissals come after Elon Musk said 'the woke mind virus' had left many of Netflix's Originals 'unwatchable.'  'Netflix recruited me seven months ago only to lay me and a bunch of other talented people off today,' tweeted Evette Dionne, a former editorial staffer .  Sara David wrote: 'I have unfortunately also been laid off by Netflix and am looking for writer/editor gigs' 'So. I got laid off from Netflix/Tudum today. Media is gonna media even when it's not technically media, I guess,' said Alex Zaragoza.  Josh Terry added: 'Uh oh! Looks like I have to do this tweet again. Is anyone hiring? Netflix just laid off my team (my job included). It was an incredible few months and I'm grateful for it but I'm stoked about whatever's next. Email is in bio.'  There have been several hypotheses for why the streamer is losing eyeballs, with many including Tesla CEO (and potential future Twitter chief) Elon Musk blaming 'the woke mind virus.'  Responding to a tweet about the subscription service's devastating performance, Musk said: 'The woke mind virus is making Netflix unwatchable.' A follower then responded: 'Woke mind virus is the biggest threat to the civilization.' The world's richest man replied to him: 'Yes.'  Fans applauded Musk's comments with some even urging him to take over Netflix after he concludes his Twitter deal. The Tesla founder is reportedly plotting to spend up to $15 billion of his own cash to take Twitter private and will launch a second takeover bid in 10 days. The billionaire, who is Twitter's second-biggest shareholder with a 9.1 percent stake, has tapped Morgan Stanley to raise $10 billion in debt and will make his next offer in a week-and-a-half, according to the New York Post. The entrepreneur worth $273 billion is also looking to borrow against his existing 9.2 per cent in the company, which could mean several billion dollars more to make his bid, the Post reported. Others, however, have suggested that the real problem is Netflix's habit of canceling beloved shows before their time, angering fans.   Popular TV dramas like The OA, Marco Polo, and The Punisher are being cancelled by the service after series two - leaving fans furious and threatening to cancel their subscriptions because they no longer want to 'invest their time in a series' over fears it will be 'culled'. Meanwhile, over half of Netflix's own reality TV shows and dramas released in 2018 have not been commissioned for a second series, compared with more than a third launched in 2017 and 28 percent in 2016, reports The Times.  It comes as the streaming behemoth has lost 200,000 subscribers in just three months, while shareholders of the US firm have been warned to expect another two million subscribers to leave in the three months to July. Bosses say a second price-rise in a year has played a part, while the company has lost 700,000 following its decision to pull out of Russia in the wake of Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Netflix said the Covid boom had 'created a lot of noise' and blamed the slowdown on the return to normality after two years of lockdowns. It also blamed password sharing for the rise in cancelled accounts, as it estimated that about 10million households worldwide are watching its service for free by using the account of a friend or another family member. The company has now started testing different ways of curbing password sharing in Chile, Costa Rica and Peru - and could extend this elsewhere if it proves successful. Bosses are also considering turning the service into a low-fee subscription supported by ads. Netflix also claimed that the market had now been 'saturated' by rising competition from streaming services including Disney+, Apple TV, Now TV, Warner Bros Discovery and Paramount, the cost-of-living crisis gripping the US, Canada and Western Europe, and its decision to quit streaming in Russia after Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine in February. And Netflix is also facing another expensive outlay in the form of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, having shelled out for a $100million deal with the couple in September 2020. As of yet, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are yet to produce any published content for the streaming giant. But the company will be pinning their hopes that their upcoming series documenting the recent Invictus Games will prove value for money. The rapid rise of rival Disney+, which has seen billions of dollars of investment in recent years, has seen competition in the streaming market increase dramatically. And other services like Amazon Prime Video, which has captured a share of the live football market in the UK, and AppleTV+, which has seen success through football comedy Ted Lasso, have also seen people turn away from Netflix.  Despite the streaming service's recent issues, there have been some successes, with dystopian Korean series Squid Game proving a huge hit, and season one of period drama Bridgerton taking the world by storm.  However fan favourites such as Bloodline and Jessica Jones were cancelled after their third season, leaving viewers frustrated and 'tired of starting something new only for it to be cancelled two years later'.",
  "a752b4745ab4e537db0d1027e7c6a078736c0623843466a669ae2138": "Australian homeowners are being warned to brace for a 15 per cent plunge in house prices with the big banks now all expecting a rate rise next week and more to follow. The Reserve Bank of Australia is widely expected to raise the cash rate on May 3 by 0.15 percentage points from a record-low of 0.1 per cent following the biggest inflation surge in 21 years. Three of Australia's Big Four banks - ANZ, Westpac and NAB - are expecting the RBA to increase the cash rate on Tuesday, marking the first increase since November 2010. They are also expecting the cash rate to hit two per cent by 2023 for the first time since May 2016, which would see monthly repayments on a typical $600,000 mortgage surge by $625 within a year. Just three weeks ago, the RBA predicted an increase in the cash rate to two per cent would cause Australian property prices to plunge by 15 per cent. 'Estimates using a model of the housing market that takes into account historical relationships between interest rates and both demand and supply factors suggest that a 200 basis point increase in interest rates from current levels would lower real housing prices by around 15 per cent over a two-year period, relative to the baseline model projection in the absence of an interest rate shock,' it said in an April 8 report. Nationwide, the Australian median property price has surged 18.2 per cent during the past year to $738,975.   A 15 per cent plunge of $110,846 would only take middle-range prices back to about $628,129, CoreLogic data showed.  Sydney's median house price has climbed by 20.6 per cent to $1.403million in the year to March.  A 15 per cent drop would see values fall by $210,473 down to $1.192million - or May 2021 levels. In Melbourne, median house prices have risen by a more subdued annual pace of 11.9 per cent.  A 15 per cent drop would see values fall by $149,856 - from $999,037 to $849,181 - hitting the lowest levels since May 2017. In Perth, where values climbed by just 7.2 per cent over the year, a 15 per cent or $85,216 fall in house prices - from $568,108 to $482,892 - would see the median level sink to a June 2009 low, in a market that peaked in 2014 after the last mining boom. WESTPAC: May increase of 0.15 percentage points. Cash rate to reach 2 per cent by May 2023 NAB: May rise of 0.15 per cent. Cash rate to reach 2.5 per cent by August 2024 ANZ: May rise of 0.15 percentage points. Cash rate of 2.25 per cent over the next 12 months and peak above 3 per cent but not until sometime after 2023 Source: RateCity  In Brisbane, house prices have risen by 32.1 per cent to $856,731 so a 15 per cent drop of $128,510 would take values back to $728,221 - which would be the lowest since July last year. In Adelaide, house prices have climbed by 28.7 per cent in a year to $658,446, so a 15 per cent drop of $98,767 would take values back to $559,679 - an August 2021 low. A national fall of 15 per cent would mirror what happened in Sydney between 2017 and 2019, before the pandemic, after the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority tightened the rules on investor and interest-only loans. But during that two-year period, national property prices fell by a lesser 8.4 per cent.  The Reserve Bank is now tipped to raise rates next week, ahead of the May 21 election, after headline inflation in the year to March climbed by 5.1 per cent - the fastest annual pace since June 2001 following the GST introduction.  Inflation is also well above the RBA's two to three per cent target. An RBA rate rise next month would be the first during an election campaign since November 2007, when Liberal prime minister John Howard was voted out of office after 11 years.   Three of the Big Four banks - ANZ, Westpac and NAB - are expecting the cash rate to rise by a record-low of 0.1 per cent from next week to hit 2 per cent in the coming year.  A 1.9 percentage point rise in the RBA cash rate by 2023 would see a typical Australian borrower, with a $600,000 mortgage, cop a monthly repayment jump of $625 - from $2,306 to $2,931. This would occur as their variable mortgage rate rose from 2.29 per cent to 4.19 per cent. RateCity.com research director Sally Tindall said borrowers needed to prepare for next week's possible rate rise. 'A rate hike next week is now a live possibility on the back of Wednesday's surging and surprising inflation figures,' she said.  'Three of the big four banks are now predicting the RBA will pull the trigger on a May cash rate hike.' The Commonwealth Bank, Australia's biggest home lender, is the only major bank predicting a rate rise in June instead of May. Unlike the other big banks, it's forecasting a cash rate peak in this cycle of 1.25 per cent by February 2023 instead of 2 per cent as ANZ, Westpac and NAB are predicting. ",
  "2039b201302b8869ec802e946bbd1f42112b9742ca558f820660ab2a": "Kim Kardashian's boyfriend Pete Davidson was in court on Thursday to support her during closing statements in their defamation trial, as the family's lawyer described Blac Chyna - accusing the family of sabotaging her reality TV show - as a domestic abuser and a liar.  The jury began their deliberations at 4.30pm on Thursday - shortly after comic and SNL star Davidson, dressed in a black sweatshirt and white jeans, slipped into the courtroom and sat in the back, behind the family. He left the court with Kim.  Shortly before the jury retired to consider their verdict, they were told that the show starring Rob Kardashian and Chyna, his then-girlfriend, was cancelled simply because the couple broke up. Michael Rhodes, representing the Kardashians, urged the jury in his summing up 'to let the family start to heal.' He said there was no substance to Chyna's suit, seeking damages for economic loss of $108 million, saying she had failed to present any hard financial evidence of loss of income or of emotional distress. Rhodes said that Chyna was violent and aggressive. 'Did Chyna beat the s*** out of Rob? Yes, she did,' he said. 'It was true. It happened.' Rhodes, referred to the day of Chyna and her 35-year-old boyfriend's 'big fight' in December 2016, when she packed up and left their home with their baby girl, Dream, born a month earlier. Rob Kardashian said that she hit him with a six-foot rod, pulled a phone cord around his neck and twice pointed a gun at his head. During her testimony, Chyna, 33, denied that they broke up at that point. Chyna maintains their relationship ended in the summer of 2017, but the defendants say Chyna acknowledged in a written declaration that the two split in December 2016. Rhodes told jurors on Thursday that she denied the relationship had ended because she wanted to show the television program was still viable. 'She had to confirm the relationship was still ok because she has to convince you that the network still wanted her show,' Rhodes said. 'This was not a relationship that any network executive wants on TV.' 'Rob & Chyna' premiered in September 2016 and ran for one season. The series was renewed for a second season, but in light of Kardashian and Chyna's breakup, plans for Season 2 were put on hold. Chyna alleges the Kardashians spread false reports of her assaulting him in order to have the 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' spinoff canceled and ruin her reality TV career.  E! network executives testified during the trial that 'Rob & Chyna' was supposed to be a light-hearted romantic comedy. The court was also told that a producer on the show told Chyna that if she wanted a second season of the show, she would have to mend her relationship with Kardashian, and suggested counseling could help. Rhodes on Thursday said Chyna's reaction to the idea was: 'F*** no, f*** that. 'F*** Rob. I'm not doing that.' Rhodes asked the jury: 'Is this the relationship you want to build your romantic comedy around? 'Somebody who would say that to her baby's father? Would you put this on the air?' Asking the jury to 'walk with me' over to his clients - Rhodes represents Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner, who are all defendants - he pointed at the assembled Kardashians and said: 'This is the child's grandmother, her aunts.' Rhodes told the jury to recall the 'pain and anguish' on Rob Kardashian's face during his testimony on Wednesday, noting: 'That was real. This is a real family. 'Yes they're famous, but they're real people. 'Just because Rob is a big guy, doesn't mean he can't be a victim. 'How would you feel if you child went through this? 'Picture Rob. What did he look like? Was that fake?' Rhodes also accused Chyna of 'hiding her money' and not filing tax returns for three years. Under oath, Chyna admitted that she told her accountant to stop preparing her tax returns for the year 2019 and has not paid taxes since. 'You cheated the government - but we're going to give you millions of dollars - is that right?' he asked the jury. 'That's concealment.' She was accused during the fight of smashing a TV, a bedroom door and a Christmas gingerbread house. 'The gingerbread house was silly, over the top and beautiful - like the Kardashians,' said Rhodes. 'When she smashed it, she was venting her anger on everything she was not going to be.' Earlier on Thursday, the judge denied Chyna's request to repeat her testimony against the Kardashians after she became upset and walked off the stand when she was shown a nude photo of herself during cross-examination.  December 14, 2016 -  Chyna says she and her then-fiance were 'laughing and joking and being silly' as they celebrated season two of Rob and Chyna being greenlit by NBC  Universal.  She denies yelling 'I'm going to kill you' to Rob. She told the court that she pointed the gun upwards and didn't put her finger where the trigger was.   Chyna says she put a phone chord around Rob's neck 'as a joke', because 'he was playing video games and I was just trying to get his attention.'  December 15, 2016 - Chyna smashes a TV and a gingerbread house and damages the bedroom door. She said she was furious at Rob for taking her phone in a fit of jealousy and locking himself in a closet to check her messages.  Kris Jenner's boyfriend, Corey Gamble, shows up at Rob and Chyna's home. Chyna says that he stood between her and Rob, telling Rob to get his car keys and get out of the house.  Chyna leaves the home with daughter Dream that morning. January 2017 - Chyna says she and Rob hiked together in Malibu. Rob reportedly goes with her to New York for her personal appearance at a strip club, where cameras followed her.  Chyna said she was also filmed by hand-held cameras at another Las Vegas appearance, which made her think they were shooting Rob and Chyna's season two.  July/August 2017 - Chyna learns Rob and Chyna had actually been cancelled. October 2017 -  Chyna files a $108 million defamation suit against Kris Jenner and Kylie, Khloe and Kim Kardashian and accuses them of forcing producers to cancel her show.  Judge Gregory W. Alarcon made the decision on Thursday afternoon to move on to closing arguments. Chyna's attorney Lynne Ciani rested the plaintiff's case on Thursday morning.  The photo is central to another trial that will begin soon after this one concludes.  Chyna is suing Rob Kardashian over the image, alleging he posted it online out of retribution. Kris Jenner, Kylie Jenner and Khloe Kardashian were in the front row of the courtroom early on Thursday.  Kim Kardashian was absent after attending most of the nine-day trial. Alarcon began reading the jury instructions in the case late Thursday morning. Ciani wrapped up her case Thursday by showing jurors a video deposition from Frances Berwick, an executive with NBCUniversal, E!'s parent company. Berwick said that a second season of 'Rob & Chyna' didn't go ahead because 'their relationship broke down.' Berwick said: 'Their relationship was in a sad place and we didn't think that it was a good fit for E! - which is frothy and escapist, on the lighter side.' Berwick said she had not had a conversation with Kris Jenner in which Kris threatened to pull 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians' if season two of 'Rob & Chyna' went ahead. Asked why NBCUniversal issued a press release in December 2016 announcing a new season, she said that didn't mean the series had been 'greenlit' but that it was only 'an indication of what we hoped to do.' She added that 'it would not be the first time' a press release had come out announcing a show that did not go forward later.   Chyna appeared in court Thursday wearing a black check jacket, black leggings and black spike heels, with an orange jacket over the top. Khloe Kardashian was also in attendance and arrived wearing a black tuxedo jacket over a silk shirt, black leggings and white sneakers.  Her mother, Kris Jenner wore black pants and a black blazer with white piping. During cross examination last week Rhodes presented Chyna with a copy of the restraining order she filed in 2017 against her ex-fiance, Rob Kardashian after he allegedly posted 'revenge porn' photos of her on social media. Attached to the restraining order documents were copies of the offending nude pictures which both parties in the case had previously agreed by stipulation would not be shown to the jury. Jurors did not see them, but Chyna did, and allegedly became 'upset' and rattled by the photos. Chyna was so distressed that when Rhodes grilled her later about the amount of damages she is seeking, she couldn't name a dollar figure and only gave vague answers to other questions he asked about damages, her lawyer claimed. Seeing the pictures 'derailed' Chyna's testimony, Ciani told Judge Alarcon. 'There was a stipulation that the photos would not be included which was violated intentionally,' she added. Ciani asked the judge to order Chyna's previous testimony about damages to be stricken from the record and that she be allowed to take the witness stand again. Rhodes denied any wrongdoing, telling the court: 'The premise that I tricked the witness (Chyna) into seeing those photographs is absurd.' Rob Kardashian testified on Wednesday that he feared for his life on a night in 2016 when his then-fiancee Blac Chyna pointed a gun at his head, pulled a phone-charging cable around his neck and repeatedly hit him with a metal rod while under the influence of substances. 'She strangled me, she put a gun to my head twice, she was on cocaine and alcohol,' Kardashian said, his voice rising nearly to a shout in a Los Angeles courtroom as Chyna's attorney Lynne Ciani sought to cast doubt on the attack and its severity. During an emotional and contentious hour on the stand, Rob Kardashian grew angry when Ciani asked him why photos and video from the days that followed didn't show any marks on him, despite his testimony that she had hit him repeatedly with a 6-foot metal rod. 'Did you have as much as a Band-Aid on you?' the attorney asked. 'I just told you it didn't leave a mark on my face!' Rob Kardashian said.  'And the gun to my head two different times during the night didn't leave a mark to my temple!' Kris Jenner and Kim Kardashian watched the testimony from the front row of the gallery, and had no visible reaction. Chyna testified earlier in the trial that she was never violent toward Rob Kardashian. She said that on the night of Dec. 14 and the morning of Dec. 15, 2016, the couple had been celebrating the news that 'Rob & Chyna' was getting a second season. The all-night celebration turned into a bitter fight by morning, when he took her phone and shut himself in a closet, looking for evidence of communications with other men, she said. She testified that earlier in the evening, she had wrapped a phone-charging cord around Rob Kardashian's neck playfully because he was ignoring her, and picked up a gun he kept around, always unloaded, from a nightstand as a joke. The chain of events would lead to the end of the relationship, and their show. Rob Kardashian, 35, the youngest of Kris Jenner's four children with the late Robert Kardashian, has kept a much lower public profile than his mother and sisters.  He was mostly an offscreen character, and only occasionally appeared, on the family's reality show. He broke from the pattern in 2016, spending a year in the limelight before it went bad.  He and Chyna began dating in January, announced their engagement in April, announced they were having a child together in May, had their own reality show premiere in September, and had a daughter, Dream, in November. He testified Wednesday that he felt in retrospect that their love was never real, and that he had been at the 'weakest, worst point' in his life when their relationship began. He said the coupling was 'toxic' from the start, and that she beat him at least five times during the yearlong relationship. 'Strangling someone, beating someone, that's not a family,' he said.  'That's not love to me.' Rob Kardashian wore a loose-fitting, untucked black dress shirt on the stand.  His otherwise dark testimony drew a laugh from most of the courtroom when Ciani suggested that two videos she showed were shot on the same day because he was wearing the same thing. 'That doesn't mean anything,' he said. 'I wear the same thing every day.' Rob Kardashian is not a defendant in this trial.  Chyna's allegations against him, stemming from the same incidents, will get a separate trial when this one is done. Earlier on Wednesday, Corey Gamble, a key witness backing up Rob Kardashian's account of the assault, insisted that he saw Chyna punch him and whip him with a phone-charging cord, as Ciani tried to poke holes in his story.  'I said that she attacked him,' testified Gamble, the longtime boyfriend and sometime co-star of 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' matriarch Kris Jenner.  'What I saw is what I saw.' Gamble said he rushed to the house the couple was staying in after Kris Jenner got an early morning call from her son, who sounded deeply distressed. When he arrived, he said, Chyna was holding some sort of metal rod, and threw it down.  She rushed toward Rob Kardashian, whipping the phone cord at him then punching him. 'By the time she got to him, she started hitting him,' Gamble testified.  'I was able to get in the middle of them two. I even got hit two or three times.' Gamble said Chyna threw a chair at Rob Kardashian's car as he was leaving, then attempted to pick up a table but Gamble stopped her. During cross-examination, Ciani had Gamble read from a declaration he submitted in the case two years earlier, in which he said he arrived to find Chyna hitting Rob Kardashian with her fists, but made no mention of any of the objects. 'You didn't see sufficient to mention the metal rod, the cord or the table?' Ciani asked. 'I don't know why I didn't include those details,' Gamble said.",
  "e7728c7ce90edc5619b9edde07e24ba858cdae3fac736ada0eba9849": "A woman accused of kidnapping a three month-old baby befriended the infant's mom at church after noticing she was heavily pregnant, it was claimed. Carolina Ayala said that Yesenia Ramirez, 43, inveigled her way into her family's life after spotting her with the huge baby bump, and became a regular called to the family's San Diego home after Ayala's son Brandon was born. Ayala said: 'She would go to my house a lot, she always wanted to be there,' Ayala told KTST-TV, a Telemundo affiliate.  Brandon was snatched from his grandmother's home Monday by a man cops say is Jose Roman Portillo, 28. They allege Portillo was encouraged to carry out the abduction on Ramirez's orders. Brandon was discovered safe in a San Diego home on Tuesday, with Ramirez and Portillo both appearing in court Thursday charged with his abduction.  Ayala said she was at work cleaning a home when her sister-in-law called her on Monday, to let her know her child was missing. 'I felt like half of my heart had left with him. I felt like I died,' Ayala told KDTV-TV, a Univision affiliate. Authorities did not issue an Amber Alert because investigators did not have a vehicle description. In the early hours of the investigation, officers and FBI agents went door-to-door in the neighborhood to appeal for witnesses or information. Ayala was reunited with her son on Tuesday, after police found him in Portillo's home, and said it was like 'having my soul return to my body.' 'I cried out of joy, I cried until I got tired of crying,' she told Telemundo 48. Ayala said that Ramirez offered to buy supplies for the baby and drove the baby and his grandmother, Victoria Mejia, to the store and back home on Monday.  Her associate, Portillo, was captured on surveillance video carrying a baby car seat and a small blanket and walking toward the apartment, police said. Police said Ramirez had been communicating with Portillo moments before walked into the house while the grandmother was unloading the groceries, and took the baby and drove away. The motive for the kidnapping is still under investigation.  Ramirez, Portillo and Ramirez's husband Baldomeo Sandoval, 37, were arrested. Sandoval has since been released without charge.  'Baby Brandon has been located,' the San Diego police department tweeted on Tuesday, adding that he would be 'taken to a local hospital as a precaution but he has been located alive. 'A million thank yous to all who assisted.'   Sgt. Christian Camarillo from the San Jose Police Department said that Ramirez was a family friend, and that the kidnappers' motives are still under investigation.  'There is a human component aspect to this incident,' he said, according to ABC7.  'Mom is very traumatized right now. She needs her space.' Camarillo said on Monday that the baby's mother was at work at the time and his father is in jail. It's unclear why the father is in jail.  'Dad right now is out of the picture. He is incarcerated,' Camarillo said. 'I don't know, you know, whether that is going to play into this, but obviously we are going to talk to him soon.' ",
  "ad8b58759989d504b50aac8c19decd0dff3a376bfbaec622da5ee055": "Public Transport NSW is bidding an emotional farewell to the familiar green social distancing markers that have been scattered across train and bus seats for the last two years. The state government agency posted the news on social media on Friday and said the stickers would be done away with by Saturday. 'From April 30, after almost two years, we're saying goodbye to green dots on public transport,' the post said. 'Masks on public transport are still mandatory though.' The video is set to an emotional James Blunt song and features a transport worker peeling off the bright green sit-here stickers from a train seat. A transport worker stroked a sticker before slowly peeling it off and throwing it out of sight as the singer croons, 'I've been addicted to you, goodbye my lover, goodbye my friend'.  The post sparked some social media debate on if it was too early to remove the social distancing markers. 'It's too soon to remove both. I'm still going to refuse to let people sit next to me,' one joked, while another asked 'how will the passengers know where to sit now?'.  The post led another to celebrate, 'I cant wait [to] say goodbye to the green dots,' with one punter saying, 'back to normality'.  The randomly-placed stickers have been a fixture of pandemic life on Sydney's transport system, with its widespread use enforcing commuters to socially distance. Despite the green dots being scrapped, mask mandates on public transport still remain in place, despite many Aussies calling for the rule to end. 'Get rid of the masks now...hardly no one wears them anyway,' one said. Atop epidemiologist called on the whole country to be rid of mask and vaccine mandates last month. The Australian National University Professor Peter Collignon hit out against a study that claimed mass mask rules dramatically reduced the spread of the virus. He said both vaccine and mask mandates should be limited to the vulnerable aged care sector now Australia has such a high vaccination rate. 'When you've already got 94 per cent [of over 16s double vaccinated] - the question is 'do we need to go further?'' he told Daily Mail Australia in February.  In January former Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Nick Coatsworth forecasted the pandemic will end this year.  'The pandemic will come to an end in 2022 because the virus will become endemic, and that means that Covid will circulate in the community,' he said.  'We will live our lives again as part of the incredibly social and incurably optimistic human species that thrives on this planet,' Dr Coatsworth wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald.  'And has emerged from countless pandemics over history stronger and more capable of managing the next.'  'With a significant contribution from Australian science, COVID-19 is now the most treatable respiratory virus known to man.",
  "144547fcc85d6229c6318066bcb5676de1bf981b830349eee21be7d6": "An election candidate is being investigated by the Australian Federal Police after it emerged he was standing in two different seats in two different states for two different political parties. A man named Malcolm Heffernan is now on the ballot for the seat of Banks in NSW and the seat of Brand in Western Australia. In NSW Mr Heffernan in a One Nation candidate, while in WA he is standing for the Australian Federation Party.  Mr Heffernan, who is listed as a financial advisor, is now under investigation after allegedly using two different birthdays and two names to declare himself as a candidate for the election.  The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) announced on Friday it had referred Mr Heffernan to the Australian Federal Police for investigation on whether he has committed a crime under the Commonwealth Criminal Code. Candidates for the Federal election were formally 'declared' on April 22 at public events held across Australia, including Mr Heffernan in two different electorates. 'Each nomination form had a signed declaration that the candidate did not intend to be a candidate in any other election held the same day,' the AEC said in a statement about Mr Heffernan's forms.  'Each nomination form had differences in the listed information - including a different date of birth, and a different expression of the candidate's name.' Mr Heffernan's dual candidacy contravenes section 165 of the Electoral Act which, according to the AEC, renders him 'incapable of being elected'.  'However, candidate nominations for the Divisions of Banks and Brand must remain as they were formally declared on 22 April 2022.  'Ballot papers have been printed and some postal voters have already received their postal voting packs.' Mr Heffernan ran in the WA seat of Canning at the 2019 election for Fraser Anning's Conservative National Party, drawing 1,600 votes or 1.76 per cent of the total votes.  In an interview with a local paper before that election Mr Heffernan said he was a financial adviser and complained about 'the billions of dollars paid to the UN and in foreign aid' which 'could be better utilised at home in assisting the Australian people' Australian Federation Party director Mark Aldridge told The West Australian that Mr Heffernan's situation was 'a mix-up'. He claimed Mr Heffernan had initially nominated for One Nation in Banks but was then told the vacancy had been filled and he was no longer needed. 'We had his WA seat (Brand) available, I did a bit of research from him, found him to be half reasonable. and so we endorsed him and filed the paperwork correctly,' Mr Aldridge said the paper. 'At some stage later the One Nation paperwork was filed in NSW. The candidate himself wasn't aware of that and has supplied text messages supporting his belief he was free to run for us.' Australia heads to the polls on May 21, with postal and pre-poll voting opening from Monday, May 9.",
  "d9d3981d8ea70a205075658ac7e0766dbb3fdcd238d40a4f414d8f78": "Cat owners who let their felines roam outdoors could face hefty fines and risk having their beloved pets impounded if strict new laws are enforced in Western Australia. Perth's City of Bayswater Council has proposed to ban cats from 42 natural areas in a bold move designed to protect native wildlife and 'designated areas of environmental sensitivity'. The council will seek community feedback on the proposal after councillors vote to repel its current cat control laws this week. Cat owners would face a $250 fine and could have their cat seized or impounded if their moggy is found in a prohibited zone under the proposed laws. They would face the same penalty if their cat is found in a public place and not under effective control. It has no plans at this stage to introduce cat curfew times or containment  recognition of 'potential community opposition and the practical aspects of enforcement', the council report states Browns Lake Reserve, Gobba Lake, Riverside Gardens and Nora Hughes wetlands are among dozens of 'environmental sensitive' site that would be off-limits to cats. The issue of cat control sparked debate at Tuesday's council meeting, Perth Now reported. 'If we get support for this, I advocate the state government actually do this - they're dragging their heels and community attitudes around cats have changed with a lot of local governments trying to achieve something along these lines,' Cr Giorgia Johnson said. Cr Sally Palmer described cats as 'tiny killing machines'. 'Pet cats kill 30 to 50 times more animals per kilometre than feral cats do in a bush,' she said. 'We need to look hard and take the courage and responsibility to accept their behaviour.' But Cr Lorna Clarke had reservations the proposed laws may be 'outside the scope of legislation'. 'It would be useful once this has been consulted on and its comes back to council for council to ask about confidential legal advice from the City which sets out some assurance that we're still within the legal power that is set under the Cat Act,' she said. The council currently has no prohibited zones for cats. 'There are many parks and wetland areas within the City which are refuges for wildlife including birds and reptiles,' its website states. 'To help protect native wildlife please ensure your cat is not straying from your property, particularly at night.",
  "cb69d1068d5088581db185f509f0c5253fe14776cfdee239858e2e81": "Anthony Albanese's first day back on the campaign trail has been marred by a Twitter blunder and a live television smackdown by Today Show host Ally Langdon.  The Labor leader shared a picture of his beloved cavoodle, Toto, watching on as he did a series of live crosses to the ABC and the Nine Network's Today Show on Friday morning.  However, the picture was swiftly deleted from social media as it clearly showed the wannabe prime minister's phone number on the dog's collar. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Labor for comment over the deleted tweet. It comes as the Labor leader emerged from isolation after spending the last week isolating at home with the virus - but if he thought he was in for an easy ride with the TV hosts, he was sorely mistaken.  Mr Albanese was grilled on Friday morning about the rising cost of living as inflation hits a 21-year high at 5.1 per cent.  The Opposition Leader said he had been doing some online shopping in quarantine and noted the cost of an iceberg lettuce is now $5.50. He was abruptly interrupted by Today co-host Allison Langdon. 'I don't think people want to hear politicians telling us what the problem is anymore,' she said.  'People are living this every day.' 'They know what the problem is. They want to know how you are going to fix it!' Briefly taken off guard, Mr Albanese insists Labor will fix the issue by plan to address wages while taking a swipe at the Coalition government. 'This government won't even put in submissions supporting a wage increase for aged care workers,' he said. 'We will lift productivity through the national reconstruction fund, by having the NBN operate properly to lift the productivity of businesses, and then the way you can place better profits and better wages.' 'The only way you can do that without placing pressure on inflation is by making sure you have those productivity improvements, and we are aiming at that as well.' Mr Albanese doubled down on his attack of the Coalition over living costs on ABC's News Breakfast.  'We need an economic plan so the economy works for people, not the other way around,' he said. 'This government are happy to claim credit any time something goes right but as soon as things don't, they look to blame someone else and not accept responsibility.  'We will accept responsibility. We will step up and recognise that people are doing it tough.' Earlier, the Labor leader took to Twitter to express his delight to be out of quarantine. 'Out of iso and back at it,' he captioned a photo with Toto before sharing a clip of the cavoodle racing around an oval after a week of being cooped up at home. 'I'm not the only one excited to be out,' he added. It comes amid murmurs that Mr Albanese was somewhat upstaged by his own frontbenchers while off sick.  Campaign spokesman Jason Clare impressed Labor voters and commentators with his strong performance in front of the cameras while Mr Albanese was in isolation.   Mr Albanese will fly to Perth later on Friday ahead of the official launch of Labor's campaign on Sunday.  He told the Today show  he feels 'terrific' after the virus knocked him around. However, he said he isn't in a rush to make up for lost time just three weeks out from the May 21 election. 'It just means being sensible. So, it means if I feel really tired, have a rest,' he said. 'It means doing, perhaps, less things during the day.  'But I expect and the doctors' advice is I'll get better each day and certainly today I feel terrific this morning, and I feel better than I did yesterday and yesterday I felt better than I did the day before. That's what happens.' By Charlie Moore, Political Reporter for Daily Mail Australia Jason Clare has received lavish praise yet again after another impressive media performance - but the odds of him one day becoming Prime Minister are stacked against him. The frontbench Labor MP made headlines last week for his impeccable communication skills in daily press conferences, with many supporters wishing he was leader instead of Anthony Albanese. The cries for him to take over stepped up again on Thursday after he expertly handled a lively media pack and prompted laughter with a witty joke at the expense of Liberal minister Alan Tudge. 'I don't think Scooby-doo could find Alan Tudge at the moment,' he said as Mr Tudge remains away from the limelight after being cleared of abusing his former staffer.  Twitter went into meltdown once again, with supporters and journalists heaping praise on the 50-year-old father of two from western Sydney. 'Loving Jason Clare's media conferences so much,' one user wrote.  'Jason Clare is on fire,' said another who praised his 'wit and humour'.  Mr Clare has also been described as handsome, and even Mr Albanese admitted: 'Jason Clare is certainly better looking than I am. There is no question about that.' But despite his strong performances, the odds of Mr Clare becoming the next Labor leader are long. Tanya Plibersek is favourite at $2.10 followed by Jim Chalmers at $3.75, Kristina Keneally at $6.50 and then Mr Clare at $8, according to Sportsbet. If he wanted to become leader in the event that Labor loses and Mr Albanese resigns, Mr Clare would likely face a messy factional struggle. As a member of the right faction of the NSW division he may have to see off challenges from Shadow Energy Minister Chris Bowen or Shadow Attorney-General Tony Burke who are in the same faction. And then he would be up against Tanya Plibersek who is a leading figure in the NSW Left faction - even before challengers from other states like Mr Chalmers and Richard Marles are considered. Ever since he came to Parliament in 2007, Mr Clare has played down his desire to become leader and those close to him say he is focussed on being a good MP and father. Mr Clare told Sky News in 2014: 'I might be touted but I have no desire to do that job at all' and revealed his 'dream job' would be minister for education.  'For me I feel like I am part of the team and not the leader of the team,' he said. However, Labor sources speaking on the condition of anonymity told Daily Mail Australia that him playing down his ambitions could simply be a smart strategy to win over voters. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern played down her ambitions before she became Labour Party leader seven weeks before the 2017 election. Other Labor sources said Mr Clare's excellent performances have put him front and centre of his colleagues' minds as a future leadership candidate. But right now Mr Clare is focussed on helping Mr Albanese kick out Scott Morrison. Asked last week why he was not in charge, he replied: 'The short answer is Anthony Albanese is the leader this country desperately needs.'  ",
  "871bbae6a09888a7633fd9f296efef048a22272196f2bc49ba63fc09": "Elon Musk sold 4.4 million shares of Tesla valued at nearly $4 billion, according to filings with the Security Exchange Commission.  The sale in shares, which were conducted on Tuesday and Wednesday, was coupled with the stock of the electric vehicle company plummeting 20 percent, with Musk, the company's CEO, simply tweeting on Thursday, 'No further TSLA sales planned for today.' The sale comes as Musk, the world's richest man, goes forward with his plan to purchase Twitter for $44 billion.  According to the SEC filings, Musk, who owned 17 percent of Tesla, made the sales at prices between $870 and $1,000 per share.  Musk had staked $12.5 billion of his ownership in Tesla as collateral to purchase Twitter, with his commitment to take over the social media platform causing an earlier drop in Tesla stock as investors feared he will be too preoccupied with his latest acquisition.  Analyst Dan Ives, of Wedbush Securities, said that Musk's focus on Twitter and the recent sell of Tesla stocks was foreboding for the future of the electric vehicle company.  'It's a brutal cycle for Tesla investors to navigate and casts a shadow on the name with Musk selling more stock,' Ives told Bloomberg. 'The Twitter deal is becoming an albatross for Tesla's stock and this pours gasoline on the raging fire.' The 12 percent fall on Tuesday, when Musk began offloading his shares, represented the biggest fall in Tesla shares since September 2020.  Musk intends to buy Twitter using the stake in Tesla, coupled with a $13 billion buyout loan from lenders and his own personal assets of $21 billion. According to SEC filings on Tuesday, Musk would owe a $1 billion termination fee if he fails to secure enough funding to complete the deal. Twitter, however, could owe Musk a $1 billion break-up fee if it accepts a competing offer or if shareholders reject the deal.    The release of the SEC filings on Thursday came as Twitter failed to meet revenue estimates in what may be one of its final quarterly earnings reports as a public company.  The social media company said revenue for the first quarter totaled $1.2 billion - a 16 percent increase from last year but less than the $1.23 billion that Wall Street analysts had expected.  However, San Francisco-based Twitter reported an average of 229 million daily active users in the quarter, up 16 percent from last year in a positive sign of growth. Twitter canceled the conference call with executives and industry analysts that usually accompanies its results, so there will be little further insight into the company's current financial condition. 'Given the pending acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk, we will not be providing any forward looking guidance, and are withdrawing all previously provided goals and outlook,' the company said in a statement. It comes as Twitter employees have warned of a 'mass exodus' of staff when Musk takes over the company, with one describing the world's richest man as 'a person with questionable ethics'. Staff on Monday were invited to an 'all-hands' meeting via videolink, hosted by CEO Parag Agrawal and Bret Taylor, the chair of the board. Questions submitted by staff during the 45-minute meeting were read out by the chief marketing officer, Leslie Berland. One question asked in a recording obtained by Project Veritas was: 'How does the board and Mr Musk plan on dealing with a mass exodus considering the acquisition is by a person with questionable ethics?' Taylor replied that 'one of the themes of today is continuity'. He said: 'The question of attrition: As Parag stated, one of the themes of today is continuity, and ensuring that Parag and this leadership team continues to operate the business successfully on behalf of our users, on behalf of our customers, and that has obviously been a big topic of discussion at the board.  'And as I mentioned, an area that is important to Elon Musk as well, because of the importance of Twitter as a service.' Agrawal said he had seen many questions about the process, about share schemes, and about working conditions in the future. He said much was still to be clarified. Staff were told there would be no layoffs 'at this time' - but no guarantees were provided when Musk takes over. Elon Musk hinted on Thursday that his political sentiment has shifted rightward over the past 14 years, by posting a meme showing a moderate liberal driven into the arms of conservatives. The image depicts a stick figure labeled 'me' remaining stationary relative to another labeled 'conservative', as the figure at the 'liberal' end of the spectrum moves further and further to the left. By the final diagram, labeled 2021, the 'me' figure is to the right of the center line, as the conservative chuckles and the liberal - now labeled 'woke progressive' - accuses the centrist of bigotry. Musk shared the post without comment, but his political views have taken on new significance after his $44billion deal to buy Twitter and his declaration the platform should be 'politically neutral'. Responding to his tweet, many angry liberals claimed conservatives had grown more extreme since 2008, the year Barack Obama was first elected president. Since his takeover was announced Monday, Musk, whose political views are elusive and sometimes contradictory, stepped up his engagement with conservatives, responding to the tweets of several right-wing commentators. Meanwhile, conservative influencers have enjoyed a considerable uptick in Twitter followers since the deal was announced, while public figures on the left of the political spectrum suffered a sharp decrease. Fox News host Tucker Carlson, Donald Trump Jr. and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis - three of America's most forthright conservative mouthpieces - have experienced an influx of 175,960, 301,570 and 286,559 followers respectively since the news of Musk's takeover broke earlier this week. Meanwhile on the left, Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez (AOC), Hillary Clinton and Ellen DeGeneres have witnessed an exodus of 26,072, 21,424 and 27,141 Twitter followers respectively in the past four days. Vice President Kamala Harris lost over 28,000 of her supporters and Michelle Obama dropped a dramatic 32,073, while her husband Barack and US President Joe Biden appeared to be the only big-name Democrats who saw their numbers increase. The fluctuation in follower numbers on either side triggered a wave of conspiracy theories seeking to explain the phenomenon. Some suggested Elon's takeover prompted developers to change the social media behemoth's algorithms to highlight conservative accounts and suppress left-leaning ones - a theory that was slapped down by people who pointed out that Musk will not officially complete his purchase of the platform for months. Others argued 'woke' Twitter programmers, who have been accused of silencing right-wing voices by suspending or banning controversial accounts whose views they disagree with, adjusted the algorithms to be more balanced in an attempt to cover up their previous biases.  But Twitter blocked its staff from making programming changes to the app to prevent it being sabotaged, rendering that theory wide of the mark as well. Now, social media expert and digital marketeer Carrie-Ann Sudlow has declared the phenomenon which has seen conservative influencers gain followers since Musk's takeover while left wingers lose out as an organic consequence of the way in which different users view the SpaceX and Tesla founder. 'It's not an algorithm issue or a conspiracy. When something like this happens in the world, [conservative influencers] have an opinion on it, and it's either popular or not popular and that leads to them gaining or losing followers,' she told DailyMail.com. 'This is a big takeover from a very influential man. With influence comes strong opinions. Elon fans seem to be for or against, with few sitting on the fence. He's making a big impact on all areas of the world, his sceptics will not want to fund him and so they leave Twitter. 'His supporters meanwhile will rejoice and jump on the back of the news, hence gaining followers.' Her analysis of the phenomenon seems to validate Twitter's own statement, which said the loss and gain of followers was down to supporters of Elon Musk and conservative influencers creating more accounts, while left-leaning users deactivated theirs. 'While we continue to take action on accounts that violate our spam policy which can affect follower counts, these fluctuations appear to largely be a result of an increase in new account creation and deactivation,' the platform said in a statement.  Twitter's board on Monday unanimously accepted a $44billion bid from Musk to buy out the company and own it outright.   Musk pledged to uphold free speech on the platform so it can fulfil its potential as the world's 'digital town square', while relaxing content restrictions and cracking down on spam posters and bots. 'Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,' Musk said in a statement following the announcement of his takeover. But news of the buyout prompted many left-leaning users to announce their intentions to leave the platform, while others expressed concern that relaxed content controls could lead to more hate speech. In yet more tweets last night and early this morning, Elon set out some more of his intentions for the platform which outlined his basic visions for the user experience, a desire to make Twitter politically neutral in its content control, and the need for increased security. Donald Trump Jr, who has 7.7 million followers, saw his followers surge by 87,296 on Tuesday alone - the day following the takeover announcement - and posited the now disproven theory the increase was due to an algorithm tweak targeting prominent conservative voices ahead of Musk's arrival. He tweeted: 'While I'm awesome and totally deserving of 87,000 new followers a day it seems that someone took the shackles off my account. Wonder if they're burning the evidence before new management comes in.' Don Jr's account had grown by between 5,000 and 10,000 tweets a day in recent weeks, with the spike in the wake of Musk's announcement immediately obvious.   Florida Governor Ron DeSantis praised Musk's bid for Twitter, calling it 'a good deal for shareholders' and saying it 'raises the prospect that the platform will be a place where free speech can thrive, not a tool for narrative enforcement.' Conservative talk show host Dana Loesch, who's long complained of account suppression, also saw her followers surge by about 9,000 on Tuesday. By comparison, she was gaining a few hundred new followers a day prior to Musk's acquisition.    Meanwhile AOC, arguably the left's most prominent voice, particularly among millennials and generation Z, has seen her follower count tumble.   Prior to Musk buying Twitter, she attracted around 1,000 new followers each day, but news of the takeover appears to have inspired many of her leftist followers to abandon the platform.  Ocasio-Cortez's fellow progressive 'squad' member - Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota - saw her followers slump by 10,097 on Tuesday alone. That is in contrast to the hundreds or even thousands of new followers she previously gained on any given day. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the abrasive Georgia representative, saw her tally rise by 41,181 on Tuesday, while her friend Matt Gaetz, the firebrand Florida congressman, went up 24,929. Taylor Greene tweeted a list of those currently banned for spreading misinformation or 'inciting violence' under Twitter's current management, arguing the platform was suppressing right-leaning voices and infringing on the right to free speech.  'Bring back President Trump,' she said. 'Bring back my personal account. Bring back Dr. Robert Malone. Bring back Alex Jones. 'Bring back Milo Yiannopoulos. Bring back the cancelled nation. Bring back freedom of speech. 'Bring back America!' Twitter today reported overall revenue and ad sales that fell short of expectations, hurt by the ongoing war in Ukraine, laying out the challenges Musk will face if he takes over the social media company. Although it reported stronger-than-expected user growth in what could be the last quarter as a public company, Twitter shares fell slightly. 'Elon Musk is buying Twitter at a time when the company is struggling to attract new users following the pandemic-driven surge,' said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing.com. To put Twitter's user growth in perspective, the sequential addition of 12 million users in the first quarter is the biggest since the height of the pandemic. Since then, it has not come near that level and has ranged between 1 million to 7 million new users per quarter, after growing by 20 million daily active users in the second quarter of 2020. The company would need to add at least 12 million users every quarter until the end of next year to achieve the ambitious 2023 goals it set for itself, which Twitter has now disavowed because of the deal. 'We think macro issues will take [Twitter] further away from its previously-stated 2023 goals,' said Angelo Zino, analyst at CFRA Research. 'We believe results along with ongoing ad related industry headwinds solidify the Board's decision to approve the Musk offer, as we see little reason to believe (Twitter) could extract greater shareholder value remaining public.' Twitter has long faced criticism for its sluggish pace of product launches. Musk has tweeted suggestions ranging from releasing a widely-demanded edit button to making the Twitter algorithm open-source. When Musk closes the deal, he will be overseeing a company that has had long-standing struggles with internal dysfunction, indecision and lack of accountability, as stated by a series of current and former Twitter employers interviewed by Reuters. Daily active users on Twitter rose to 229 million in the first quarter ended March 31, from 199 million a year earlier. The figure beat analyst expectations of 226.8 million daily active users.",
  "add9ef7829f4553bf473b0200091f52e065b57cceec6289338d18588": "Pet owners are up in arms after a series of cats were spray-painted in a bizarre spate of attacks in a regional area.  The attacks, which occurred near the town of Wangaratta, Victoria, saw the household pets brazenly sprayed with aerosol paint.  The issue has sparked concern from a leading animal rights advocate, who says not enough is being done by governments to fight animal cruelty.  Emma Hurst, a member of NSW Legislative Council, said: 'It is disgusting that a member of the public would harm an animal in this way.'  She argued the enforcement of animal cruelty laws is 'drastically underfunded' by the state government.  Ms Hurst claimed the animal protection enforcement bodies in NSW receive less than half a million dollars a year to uphold animal cruelty rules.   'That's less than $500,000 to protect every animal in NSW,' she said.  Ms Hurst said the lack of funding made it difficult for these charities to respond to, investigate and prosecute every act of animal cruelty. Hotlines aren't being staffed 24/7, she said. Ms Hurst said 'spray paints and dyes are toxic, and can be very harmful to animals especially when sprayed into the face, eyes, nose and mouth.'  'In NSW it is an offence to commit an act of cruelty on an animal - this includes any act which unnecessarily inflicts pain on an animal.'  'Anyone who sees evidence of animal cruelty should immediately report it to the police, the RSPCA, or the Animal Welfare League NSW.' The incident comes after a similar incident involving a white cockatoo spray-painted green in June last year.   Bruno Bouchet saw the bird in a flock of about 30 cockatoos at Campbelltown Train Station in Sydney's south-west in June last year. Colourful cockatoos have been spotted around Sydney in recent previous years, but painting or dyeing a bird in NSW could put you behind bars for six months. ",
  "338b1298cc01940c92b79b0edbecffa5aed7e2a72af7ab68a1421ea5": "Liberal election candidate Katharine Deves has declared she is not transphobic and can still win despite the controversial start to her campaign. Prime Minister Scott Morrison's 'captain's pick' for the Sydney northern beaches seat of Warringah has told Ben Fordham on 2GB that despite being attacked for her comments on trans people participating in women's sport, she has never contemplated quitting. 'I believe this is very much an issue of equality and fairness and I have received messages of support from all over Australia,' she said. 'Australians are very much on side with my position.'  Fordham mentioned Ms Deves had arrived at the 2GB studios flanked by security guards as she faced death threats as a result of her old social media posts. Ms Deves said she had 'drawn strength' from meeting people in the electorate during the campaign as she battled intense criticism.  'I don't look at it. I have a great supportive team around me so I can concentrate on the job,' she said of the 'pile-on' she had received as a result of her stance. She said she got involved in the issue of trans people in sport because she has three little girls who play different sports. 'I saw that little girls and young women should have someone standing up representing their interests and all I ever wanted was for this debate to be held in the public domain. Fordham asked Ms Deves directly whether she was transphobic. 'Oh of course not, Ben,' she responded.  'This isn't about (transphobia), this argument is about women and girls.  'Back in the early 1990s I was going to Mardi Gras, I voted for same-sex marriage, I don't have an issue with that but this is about a collision of rights and we just need to be able to debate it in a respectful way.' Ms Deves also said she could still win Warringah.  'I wouldn't have stood up if I didn't believe I had a chance to win,' she said.   In the wake of Ms Deves' comments, there have been multiple calls for Ms Deves to be disendorsed, including by prominent Liberals North Sydney MP Trent Zimmerman and NSW Treasurer Matt Kean. Ms Deves faces an uphill battle to reclaim Warringah for the Liberals, with the former blue-ribbon seat currently held by independent MP Zali Steggall by more than seven per cent. Ms Steggall was $1.04 favourite to win the seat while Ms Deves is at $9, according to the most recent Sportsbet odds.  Ms Deves has become a divisive figure following a number of provocative comments on her Twitter account - which she has since deleted. She once declared trans teenagers are 'surgically mutilated' and felt personally 'triggered' by the rainbow Pride flag. The Warringah candidate also bizarrely linked cross-dressing males and and trans women to 'sexual predators, even serial killers'. 'Transvestism is very common among sexual predators, even serial killers,' she said in a historical tweet. 'So how are we women supposed to tell the difference between the ones who are a threat and the ones who aren't? Easier for women to exclude all males from spaces where we are vulnerable.' Last September Ms Deves described the prospect of two gay men having a baby as a 'vanity project.' 'Surrogacy is a human rights violation,' she tweeted. 'Women's bodies are not vehicles for a vanity project.' Ms Deves was referring to Pete Buttigieg, the first openly gay U.S. presidential candidate, and his husband, who are joint fathers of twin girls. In another tweet, Ms Deves said 'transablism' - where trans people pretend to be disabled - is 'a thing' and likened people in that category to a well-known serial killer. Mr Morrison subsequently defended her as the party's candidate as she received a torrent of online abuse over the comments. 'She is standing up for women and girls and their access to fair sport in this country,' the PM said. 'She has learned in her advocacy in her private life there are better ways to do things to take things forward as a Member of Parliament. 'I believe that is how she will approach the task if she is elected as the member for Warringah, and I don't think she should be silenced.'",
  "1d2dba294c4aa453faf6f0ba857134fbf5116d04b3a30249a8a1a416": "Feared underworld trigger man George Marrogi will spend at least 27 years behind bars for the cold blooded public execution of a drug rival.  Marrogi, 33, was on Friday sentenced in the Supreme Court of Victoria to a total of 32 years in jail - all of which he is likely to serve going off his alleged bad behaviour behind bars.  It took three gruelling trials for a jury to finally convict Marrogi of the 2016 murder of drug dealer Kadir Ors, who was riddled with bullets in the execution-style hit in broad daylight.  In what would be Justice Paul Coghlan's last ever sentence as a Supreme Court of Victoria judge, the retiring justice said Marrogi had shown no remorse for the murder and continued to maintain his innocence.  'This is one of the most blatant examples of murder I have ever seen,' Justice Coghlan said.  Marrogi, who was born in Iraq and migrated to Australia in 1996, has already spent most of his life behind bars, having been sentenced to a minimum of six years for manslaughter as a youth.   He had been charged with murder after he got involved in a wild brawl in 2005 in which he stabbed and killed a man.  On release he continued to offend and was later jailed for arson.  Five months later he would be charged with murder for a second time - this time it would stick.   In total, Marrogi has spent 15 of last the 16 years behind bars, missing his own sister's funeral just six months ago.  Upon hearing the sentence, Marrogi directed a spray at the detective who had finally brought him to justice.  Ors, 24, had been lured to a meeting with Marrogi unaware that his number was about to be punched.  CCTV captured from a carpark in Campbellfield, 13km north of Melbourne, showed Marrogi stalking his prey, who was accompanied by two mates.  The court heard Marrogi chased down Ors, ignoring his friends altogether, before catching up with Ors outside an Officeworks.  Marrogi shot his terrified victim seven times, hitting him in the back, leg, hip and buttocks.  After blasting Ors, Marrogi made a wild escape from the scene as two of the dead man's mates pursued him in another vehicle.  Even then, the ruthless killer fired even more shots at Ors as he lay bleeding out on the footpath.  Police would later determine Marrogi had fired 13 rounds during the hit.  In scenes emulating a Hollywood movie, the tyres of Marrogi's Commodore were blasted out by his pursuers, forcing him to pull over in Broadmeadows.  Undeterred, Marrogi exited the stricken vehicle and took aim at his pursuers, firing off another four rounds in their direction.  While Marrogi escaped the chaos, police found the empty box of the bullets in the abandoned Commodore which Marrogi had sprayed all over Melbourne's northern suburbs. The gunman had also left his DNA on the box and the car was quickly linked directly back to a childhood mate of Marrogi.  Police had also claimed a hoodie worn by the shooter was purchased the same day, and a receipt for a similar item of clothing was found at Marrogi's home.  The killer's barrister had successfully puzzled two juries over the crucial DNA evidence, which he claimed had been transferred onto the incriminating bullet box by someone else.  Marrogi had been playing a dangerous game leading up to the murder, with police already suspecting him of being the triggerman that shot Nabil 'Mad Lebo' Maghnie just months earlier.  Maghnie would be shot and killed while Marrogi was still behind bars fighting the Ors assassination.  A third jury, who sat through a 16-day trial, would have no doubt it was Marrogi behind Ors' murder.  It was a solid call.  On Monday it was revealed Marrogi had done little to reform his passion for crime while awaiting sentence.  Marrogi has been allegedly running his gang, Notorious Crime Family, from the confines of Barwon Prison - one of Australia's toughest jails.  Police allege Marrogi was allegedly setting up drug deals from Barwon Prison while pretending to be on the phone with his lawyer, the Herald Sun reported this week. On Wednesday, it was revealed Marrogi and his cohorts had allegedly planned another assassination for this very weekend, which was thwarted.   Acting Deputy Commissioner Bob Hill said the syndicate had access to military-style weapons, illicit drugs and unexplained wealth. He said the alleged murder plot was disrupted by state and federal police after receiving credible information that members of the syndicate intended to kill someone this weekend. ",
  "e295799f04c660770405925ae0d8f7444110b1c7d6fd0e34dc5cbcce": "A former U.S. Marine jailed in Russia on what he claims are trumped-up spy charges has demanded to know why his release was not secured in the prisoner swap that freed Trevor Reed. 'Why was I left behind? While I am pleased Trevor is home with his family, I have been held on a fictitious charge of espionage for 40 months,' Paul Whelan said Wednesday in a statement obtained by CNN. 'The world knows this charge was fabricated. Why hasn't more been done to secure my release?'  Whelan, 52, was arrested on espionage charges in December 2018 after being detained at a Moscow hotel. Despite vehemently denying the allegations, the ex-Marine was convicted June 2020 and sentenced to 16 years in prison in a trial that U.S. officials have denounced as 'unfair'. The prisoner's plea came after Reed, also an ex-Marine, was freed by the Kremlin on an airport tarmac in Ankara, Turkey, in exchange for Russian pilot Konstantin Yaroshenko. Reed was convicted in Russia in 2019 of endangering the lives of two police officers while drunk on a visit to Moscow. The U.S. called his trial a 'theater of the absurd.' Yaroshenko was arrested by American special forces in Liberia in 2010 and convicted of conspiracy to smuggle cocaine into the U.S. Russia had proposed a swap for the pilot in July 2019 in exchange for any American prisoner. The U.S. government claims they are working to free other Americans currently detained in Russia, including Whelan and WNBA player Brittney Griner, who was arrested in February after a vape pen filled with hash oil was found in her luggage at the Moscow airport. Whelan learned of the swap, and his continued detainment, on Wednesday by hearing it on a Russian TV network, according to his sister, Elizabeth Whelan. 'He was very upset,' Elizabeth told CNN. She claims their family was notified early Wednesday morning that 'Trevor was coming back and Paul was not.' 'I had barely time to alert my parents and brothers when it was all over the news,' Elizabeth said, noting she 'was unhappy that we were given so little time to absorb this bad news.' She also shared how their family, specifically her parents, was 'devastated, completely crushed' by the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs' decision to leave Whelan behind.   'When I had a virtual call with the SPEHA group later that day I let them know in no uncertain terms what I thought of the administration's terrible decision to leave Paul behind,' Elizabeth told the television network.  'I expect to continue communication with State and the NSC on an extremely regular basis until Paul is returned also.' The detainee's brother, David Whelan, also weighed, arguing that President Joe Biden's administration 'has engaged in far greater outreach with our family, and with the families of other hostages, than the Trump administration did' and said he is 'confident President Biden cares and his team is making an effort.' 'Unfortunately, that wasn't enough for Paul,' David said. 'Perhaps someday it will be.'  'I am glad that President Biden reiterated this morning his vow to bring Paul home. Because otherwise it feels as though his pledge 'not to walk away' from Paul, given last summer in Geneva, feels hollow today.' The State Department, in a statement to CNN, confirmed 'the case of Paul Whelan is one we continue to work day in, day out.' 'Paul Whelan is wrongfully detained in Russia,' spokesperson Ned Price said. 'Roger Carstens and his team continue to do everything we can to seek his release from Russian custody.' The White House also claimed officials are working to secure Whelan's release but declined to provide any details into the negotiations.  'Obviously, our objective continues to bring Paul Whelan home, and any American who is not with their family and is being detained overseas,' Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday. 'But I'm just not going to get into more details because I want to maintain the protection of our process.'  She also resisted the suggestion that Yaroshenko's release 'narrows the chances' of Whelan's release. 'We will continue to advocate for the immediate and unconditional release of Paul at every opportunity, and using wrongful detention as a bargaining chip represents a threat to the safety of everyone traveling, working and living abroad,' she said. Reed, 30, of North Texas, arrived back in the U.S. on Thursday after being freed in the swap, with officials saying his 'spirit is strong.' The swap, which some have likened to a famed Cold War prisoner exchange on the so-called Bridge of Spies, was caught on camera. The footage shows Yaroshenko disembark an American private jet, accompanied by security personnel, and walk towards Russian officials waiting nearby with Reed. Reed is seen stepping out of the plane with Russian officials as they make their way to the center of the runway, where American officials are waiting.  The Marine was seen walking with an agent and carrying two bags while Yaroshenko carried a single bag and what appeared to be a manila envelope.  As the Russian and American agents meet, the agent with the bags is seen escorting Reed directly to the American plane as Yaroshenko waits while the officials talk. The Americans and Russians are then seen shaking hands before the U.S. agents escort Reed to their plane.  U.S. Representative August Pfluger of Texas said Reed arrived at a San Antonio airport in the predawn hours. Pfluger posted pictures of the arrival on Twitter, with one showing the congressman making a thumbs-up gesture standing next to Reed. Other photos showed Reed standing with his parents and loved ones at the airport. 'The joy on their face, to see their son - obviously very worried about his health,' said congressional hearing with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday. 'And it's going to take some time to heal, to get back to good health. But his spirit is strong. He's a fighter. He's a survivor.' 'The reunification with his family was just tremendous,' Pfluger added. Reed's parents, Joey and Paula, now say their 'prayers have been answered,' telling CNN New Day host Brianna Keilar: 'Obviously, we're ecstatic.'  The swap was not part of broader diplomatic talks and did not represent an American change in approach on Ukraine, according to U.S. officials.  Russian-American relations have been at their worst since the Cold War era following Russia's February 24 invasion of Ukraine and subsequent Western sanctions imposed on Moscow. Russian news agencies reported that Yaroshenko landed back in Moscow on Wednesday and was reunited with his wife and daughter. Yaroshenko said on Thursday he had been tortured in custody in Liberia before his extradition to America. The pilot also claimed he had been beaten at a military base in the United States, an allegation rejected by the White House. Russian news agencies reported on April 4 that Reed had ended a hunger strike and was being treated in his prison's medical center.   Reed's parents said at the time that he had been exposed to an inmate with tuberculosis in December.  The prison service said Reed tested negative for tuberculosis.",
  "80695481034d1e8174e4f66a03ae754e619f0a5a10eef001ac02ace9": "An aspiring politician wants to ban obese Australians from purchasing products containing white sugar or refined flour as part of a plan to combat obesity. Liberal National Party candidate Nicole Tobin, who also works as a teacher, agreed with a social media post that claimed obese people 'shouldn't be able to purchase anything containing white sugar or refined flour'. 'And no soft drink if your BMI is over 30 either,' she wrote. 'Water or one glass of red wine.' Ms Tobin is running for the senate in Queensland for the Liberal National Party from an unwinnable spot at number six on the ticket. The teacher also told NewsCorp that she could always spot the lunchboxes of children who were overweight, because they were filled with Tiny Teddies and muffins from Coles and Woolies. 'And I know parents are busy. I'm not saying I never sent my children with packaged food, but the ones who consistently have packaged food are the ones that you know, they don't always make the good choices. ' The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows that 25 per cent of children aged five to 17, and 67 per cent of adults are overweight or obese. Ms Tobin says she only allows her children to drink soft drinks when competing in cross-country running events. She only drinks them herself on election day, because she 'needs the sugar'. 'I do think that people's doctors should definitely be saying to them, I'm sorry. You need to cut down on things. It's that simple.' Her comments follow Australia's top doctors calling for a sugar tax on sweetened drinks to help tackle obesity, heart disease, diabetes and strokes to save billions in health costs. The Australian Medical Association wants a tax of 40 cents per 100 grams of sugar which would increase the price of sweetened drinks by an average of 20 per cent.  The World Health Organisation says a 20 per cent increase is the minimum required to stop people buying them. The tax would increase the cost of a 375ml can of coca cola with 40g of sugar by 16 cents and a 500ml can of Rockstar: Super Sours Energy Drink with 65g of sugar by 26 cents. The AMA estimates the tax would raise $814million a year - which could be spent on tackling obesity - and result in 16,000 fewer cases of type 2 diabetes, 4,400 fewer cases of heart disease and 1,100 fewer strokes over 25 years. The tax would reduce obesity by two per cent and save taxpayers up to $1.73 billion on healthcare costs, the AMA says. 'It could save lives, and save millions of dollars in healthcare costs,' said AMA president Dr Omar Khorshid. More than 2.4 billion litres of sugary drinks are consumer every year in Australia, enough fill 960 Olympic sized swimming pools. Dr Khorshid said they have 'no nutritional value' and fuel diabetes, obesity and poor vascular health which are 'huge contributors to the burden on our health system. 'The tax on sugary drinks sends a clear price signal to consumers that a product is unhealthy and makes it less affordable,' he said 'It can also nudge manufacturers to reformulate their products to contain less sugar. 'The added bonus is that it will generate revenue to rekindle our nation's preventative health agenda,' Dr Khorshid said. The AMA recommends the Commonwealth ultimately expands the tax to 'incorporate other products that have little or no nutritional benefit, and/or high sugar content'. Several jurisdictions around the world already have a sugar tax including the UK, Mexico, France, Chile and some US cities. The UK scheme targeted at soft drinks prompted half of drink manufactures to reduce the sugar content of their products to avoid the tax in the two years after it was announced in 2016. However, critics have slammed the proposal, saying it will only hike prices for poor families who consume more sugar. 'Sugar taxes are elitist and inherently regressive,' said Gideon Rozner, Director of Policy at free market think tank the Institute of Public Affairs. 'What kind of mean-spirited organisation proposes to make soft drinks less affordable for working people? 'Not content to throw us out of work and trash our liberties, the public health lobby is now angling to take away the precious few of life's joys we have left. 'The AMA should focus on issues pertaining to the medical profession, not telling the rest of us how to live our lives.'",
  "82cb1aab1871e8c4144517ea010385fa4e2125e3c6db3ec740fed07c": "A seven-month-old girl was shot in the chest and killed during a drive-by shooting in Toledo, Ohio, while she was sitting next to her father in his car.  Desire Hughes was shot on Wednesday night and treated for at least one gunshot wound to the chest before succumbing to her injuries, the Lucas County Coroner's Office reported. Her father, Jeremiah Hughes, 20, was grazed by a bullet in the shooting and has since been released from the hospital, mourning his daughter's death.  Cops believe the shooting to be drugs or gang-related.   'I was a happy dad, you feelin' me? She was gonna change my life, man,' Hughes told the Toledo Blade after coming home on Thursday. 'That was the one that was gonna change my life.  'That's why I'm so sick, I don't even know what to do,' he added. 'My baby... they really took that girl from me.'  No suspects have been identified as the shooting is currently under investigation. Toledo Police Chief George Kral has urged members of the community to check on their outdoor cameras or doorbell monitors for any clues about the shooting.  'I'm imploring the community to reach out and help us out,' Kral told the Blade. 'I mean this is a 7-month-old child, who has never done anything wrong in her little life... we need justice for this young person.'  Toledo Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz condemned the murder of Desire, the fourth homicide reported this week in the Ohio city, suggesting gang violence was involved in the latest killing.  'No one pulls up to a car and shoots into another car randomly,' Kapszukiewicz told the Blade.  'It's unfair to the 275,000 who live in the city to feel less safe than they should have because of the 50 people in a gang who are playing out a revenge drama that affects all of us.'  Two months ago, Damia Ezell, 10, was also shot in the chest and killed while riding in her uncle's car in Toledo.  Kenneth White, 24, was driving his niece around the Old West End neighborhood when a dark vehicle with tinted windows pulled up beside him and fired at his car. Ezelle was killed and White was taken to the hospital for life-threatening injuries.  Lucas County Children Services Executive Director Robin Reese said there is now a 'troubling trend' of children falling prey to gun violence on the streets of the county.  'This cannot be something normal that we get used to,' she said in a statement.  'Children are literally dying on our streets. This cannot be something that we accept.' Reese led the Lucas County Children Services' annual memorial recognizing children who have died due to abuse or violence in the last year on Thursday, hours after Desire was killed.   ",
  "5cbf6be4eefefa149e59dbeb1f36e4e33ea1d13f27dc0ef35e9dc57e": "Texas Congressman Chip Roy confronted Department of Homeland Security chief Alejandro Mayorkas with photos of dead illegal migrants as he raged at him over Biden's immigration crisis.  Roy, holding up photographs of dead migrants, confronted Mayorkas regarding the administration's policies. 'Mr. Secretary, do you know what this is? This is a mobile morgue, a body trailer needed by counties in south Texas overwhelmed by dead migrants,' Roy said to Mayorkas. 'That particular trailer is filled with these bodies. Twenty-seven bodies that were stored in this mobile morgue in south Texas with dead bodies of migrants.'  'Dead bodies like this one found on a ranch just three weeks ago in south Texas, a dead migrant. Somehow that's compassion,' he added.  Roy believes that the Biden administration, including Mayorkas, have encouraged cartels and other migrants to cross the border, which he says is hurting his state and America.   'You know it and you're ignoring the actual truth!'  'How about the dead bodies found by migrants? Compassion? How about the ranchers, who had to walk out of their door and this is what they faced, gentleman with rocks threatening a rancher in south Texas, only able to be saved when they are able to bring their dogs out to scare the people away in order to save themselves,' he added. He then connected the administration's immigration policies to America's opioid crisis and said the Biden White House's lax enforcement of the border was responsible for thousands of drug deaths.    Mayorkas defended the administration's handling of immigration Wednesday and Thursday amid a huge surge at the Mexico border that is expected to intensify as pandemic-related entry curbs are dropped. President Joe Biden's administration has revealed it plans to end Title 42, a measure allowing the quick expulsion of migrants during the Covid-19 crisis, on May 23 -- in an announcement that sparked cross-party anger.    'How about the lost voices for people dying from fentanyl, the tens of thousands of Americans dying from fentanyl? Faces, faces of Americans, faces of Americans across this country dying because of fentanyl pouring into our country because of your policies that you know full well.' Mayorkas responded: 'Congressman, are you actually interested in the facts and the law?' and tried to continue but Roy would not let him. US Customs and Border Protection says it encountered 7,800 undocumented migrants a day along the southwest border in the past three weeks -- almost five times the average of 1,600 recorded from 2014-2019, before the coronavirus outbreak. 'We inherited a broken and dismantled system that is already under strain. It is not built to manage the current levels and types of migratory flows,' Mayorkas told the House Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee, urging Congress to pass long-term reforms. Mayorkas's testimony came with the administration locking horns with a federal court in Louisiana that granted a request by Republican-controlled states to temporarily halt their planning to wind down Title 42. The order prevents the government from taking any action before a hearing on May 13 to determine whether Title 42 can be lifted. Mayorkas set out a blueprint to boost border personnel, target people smugglers, speed up processing and increase holding capacity -- as he warned the worst was yet to come. 'A significant increase in migrant encounters will strain our system even further and we will address this challenge successfully,' he said. 'It will take time, and we need the partnership of Congress, state and local officials, NGOs and communities to do so.' Enacted at the start of the pandemic in March 2020 under then-president Donald Trump, Title 42 requires border agents to turn away anyone who crosses undocumented into the United States. Representative Jim Jordan accused on Thursday the Biden administration of 'deliberately' and 'intentionally' causing the southern border crisis as Republicans tore into Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for being 'out of touch' and a 'traitor.'  The House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member said during his opening statement that Mayorkas will face questions on why he implemented policies that led to the chaos. 'It's intentional, it has to be,' Jordan said at the top of his remarks to the body on Thursday morning. 'The chaos on our southern border is not an accident,' the Ohio Republican congressman continued. 'It's deliberate, it's on purpose, it's by design.' 'President Biden on Day One said there'll be a moratorium on deportations, he ended Remain in Mexico, he terminated agreements with Northern Triangle countries and he stopped building the wall,' Jordan rattled off. 'Those policies, done intentionally, have led to all kinds of bad outcomes.'  He said: 'Americans want legal immigration. President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas want illegal immigration. They want illegal migrants to come, stay and never go home. Now, the secretary won't say that. In fact, he says everything's just fine. He said it yesterday in two congressional hearings. He said it last September. Quote, 'The border is secure,' he told us.'  Mayorkas appeared before the House Appropriations DHS Subcommittee and House Homeland Security Committee on Wednesday to justify the administration's request for $97.3 billion for the department's budget in Fiscal Year 2023. He said the money would go toward investing in meeting the 'the shifting field landscape' at the border and on other national security fronts - like from domestic and foreign terrorism and cyber attacks. During those hearings, Mayorkas was lambasted by Republicans after he said the administration is 'effectively managing' the situation at the southern border. In March alone, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) encountered 221,303 migrants crossing the southern border. This figure is the highest in more than two-decades and the biggest spike since President Joe Biden took office in January 2021. The previous high was in July 2021, when CBP encountered 213,593 migrants. Colorado Republican Representative Ken Buck told Mayorkas during the Judiciary hearing on Wednesday: 'My constituents want you impeached because they believe you've committed treason.' 'They believe you're a traitor. They compare you to Benedict Arnold. You know, no parent with the last name Arnold names their kid Benedict.' Buck said that over the weekend 'a lady approached me and asked me if you [Mayorkas] felt any shame for what you've done to this country.' 'My question for you, Secretary Mayorkas, is very simple,' he added. 'Would you please answer that lady's question? Are you ashamed for what you've done to this country? 'My response to what you have just said - it is so profoundly offensive on so many different levels, in so many different regards. I won't ask you for an apology,' he said. 'Don't. I won't,' Buck shot back. 'I am incredibly proud of my service to this country,' Mayorkas said during the back-and-forth with Buck. 'It is more than 20 years of service in the civilian corps as a federal prosecutor and as a member of the Department of Homeland Security. That is my response.' 'What do you say to the mothers of the children who have died from the fentanyl overdoses? What do you say to all the people out there who can't get an education because of what you've done with immigration in this country? You've secured the homeland? It's a farce,' Buck concluded.",
  "509cacc2a78fac245be7a8656c8c681582c3428b7d369494de8f5730": "Anthony Albanese has been interrogated over his opinion of trans men in an interview with two teenage journalists - who demanded to know: 'Are trans men, men, yes or no?'  The Opposition Leader submitted to an interview with Year 9 student Leonardo Puglisi and his political reporter Roman Mackinnon following on from Prime Minister Scott Morrison's interview with the teens in early April. Mr Puglisi, 14, is the founder of 6News, 'a team of young, passionate reporters' for the digital age with a presence on Youtube, Patreon and other social media channels.  In a teaser clip released for the interview, to be released next Tuesday, Mr Puglisi is seen asking Mr Albanese a 'yes or no question'. 'Are trans men, men, yes or no?'  'Well, it's... it's up to them to define... people are able to define themselves,' Mr Albanese responds.  The teaser clip also sees Mr Albanese asked whether he broke his promise to take all questions from reporters at daily press conference after he curtailed the length of the events following his statistics gaffe on the first day of the campaign. Mr Albanese is also heard outlining Labor's plans for Medicare, childcare and climate change. Mr Puglisi then asks whether he'll 'own up' to mistakes if elected as the clip dissolves to a promo for the broadcast of the full interview on the 6News Youtube channel next week. In early April the teen journalists scored an interview with Scott Morrison in which he responded to the suggestion he is a serial liar as 'silly word games' and 'juvenile debates' that don't matter to ordinary Australians.  'So you don't think Australians are interested in whether their leader tells the truth or not?' Mr Puglisi persisted.  'I do tell the truth,' Mr Morrison responded, but then conceded politicians 'might get the odd fact wrong' and that Australians know he is 'up front' with them.   Puglisi reminded Mr Morrison of two alleged lies he had told regarding his use of the term 'Shanghai Sam' about disgraced former senator Sam Dastyari, and his comments about his Hillsong Church attendance in the wake of allegations about its ex-pastor Brian Houston. 'I didn't say I've never walked into the door of Hillsong church. It hasn't been my home community church. On occasion I've visited there, I've visited many churches in the last 15 years... Coptic orthodox, Greek orthodox, Maronite churches, I've been inside synagogues, I've been inside temples, I've been in mosques, I've been in many places,' Mr Morrison responded. He said the opposition 'throw a lot of mud at you when you're a Prime Minister, and that's because they haven't got any policies ... if you've got nothing to say, and you've got nothing to offer, you'll sledge and you'll throw mud.'  Mr Albanese appears to have conducted the interview with 6News during his enforced isolation period after he contracted Covid. He rejoined the campaign trail on Friday and is due to officially launch Labor's quest for government in Perth on Sunday.  ",
  "62621a4e883d7cbce6106e1e94e63410a4622a63b1aac9bdc655fd70": "Sarah Ferguson has been announced as the new host of the ABC's flagship current affairs programme 7.30 - three decades after she was hired to work for the public broadcaster by her own future husband.  Ferguson, 56, was officially announced on Friday as the replacement for Leigh Sales after the host revealed in February she would step down from her role in June, after 12 years in the plum position.  It marks a stunning rise for the veteran investigative journalist who first began work with the public broadcaster as a humble researcher when Nigerian-born Ferguson was selected to work with a young Australian journalist on a job. Tony Jones, best known as the former host of Q&A, was working as a London correspondent for the ABC when he hired Ferguson to help him out on a story about French politics in 1992.  The chance encounter was not only the beginning of a stellar career but the start of a romantic relationship that led to marriage and three children.  'It was a 'there you are - I've been waiting for you' moment,' Sarah Ferguson told Mia Freedman on a recent episode of her No Filter podcast.  Ferguson and Jones tied the knot in 1993 - one year after they first met in Paris.  The pair have been inseparable ever since and have travelled around the world together as they support each other in their roles. The couple spent a year in Rovinj, in Croatia, in 1996 and relocated to the United States when Ferguson landed a role as 'special reporter' in Washington in 2021.  After stints elsewhere, Ferguson once again joined the ABC in 2008 and has produced award winning documentaries, such as the multi-part 'Killing Season' about the end of the Rudd/Gillard government, for Four Corners.   Over her career - which has included high-profile roles in Washington and documentaries about domestic violence, paedophilia and live cattle exports - Ferguson has garnered a reputation for no-nonsense interviewing. That is what she's expected to bring to the role as she steps into Sales' shoes. It's a role she's reprised before, filling in as 7.30 host for six months in 2014 while Sales was on maternity leave. 'I'm delighted to take on the presenter role at 7.30,' Ferguson said. 'Led by Leigh Sales and chief political correspondent Laura Tingle, the 7.30 team has created a powerhouse program, making superb current affairs journalism on the cutting edge of the genre.' 'Working in collaboration with the inimitable Laura is irresistible. Adding myself into that mix sounds tremendously rewarding at a time when scrutiny of power is essential, when our social structures are undergoing profound change. 'On Leigh's departure, I'd like to say that her diligence and skill have made an enormous contribution to Australian journalism. What you don't see in her calm studio presence is the huge amount of work she does in preparation. It will be a pleasure to take over from such a pro. 'Public service journalism has to deliver for the Australian audience, all day, every day. No one in Australia should ever feel they have no voice.  'It's our job to show how public broadcasting can create a place for everyone to come and debate, think deeply, be thrilled, entertained and sometimes provoked,' Ferguson said.  'This is the opposite of seeking to polarise in ways we are seeing in media worldwide.' ABC managing director David Anderson said audiences 'know and respect' Ferguson. 'Her work has set an unparalleled standard not only in Australian journalism but internationally, as evidenced by her recent reporting from Ukraine,' he said. 'Sarah is an exceptional appointment to take over 7.30 hosting duties from Leigh, alongside an outstanding team. 7.30 has been Australia's premier daily current affairs program for decades and will continue to be so with Sarah at the helm.'  Sarah Ferguson was born in Lagos, Nigeria, where her British-born parents lived before moving to Britain as the Biafran war broke out. Ferguson's career began in newspapers in the United Kingdom, before moving to Paris and working as a researcher and production assistant on arts programs for French and British broadcasters. She met her husband Tony Jones, after he hired her to help him for a story on ABC in 1992, while he was working as ABC's London correspondent . Ferguson had been working as a researcher and production assistant for French and British broadcasters up until that point in time.  In 2000, Ferguson worked as a reporter for Dateline and Insight. In 2004 she joined the Sunday program on Channel Nine and in 2008 joined Four Corners. In 2014, Ferguson hosted 7.30 and her interviews with the Australian treasurer Joe Hockey were nominated for a Walkley for journalistic excellence.  They would later be described as 'aggressive' and 'the tone of the questioning could have been interpreted by some viewers to be a potential breach of the ABC's impartiality guidelines.' In 2014, Ferguson caused controversy at the Walkley Awards when she publicly railed against job cuts at the ABC.  In 2016, she presented award winning documentary 'Hitting Home'. The segment covered domestic violence in Australia and earned Ferguson a Walkley Documentary Award and Best Documentary at the 2016 AACTA Awards.   In 2017, as Ferguson was getting off a plane, she was told that her mother Marjorie had died suddenly in England.  Later she became aware that hospital negligence had led to her mother's death. She wrote about the experience in her book On Mother. Director of News Justin Stevens described her as 'formidable'. 'We're incredibly fortunate with the depth of talent we have at the ABC,' he said. 'Leigh Sales has done a superb job anchoring 7.30 for the past 12 years and to have someone of the calibre of Sarah Ferguson to take up the baton, working alongside Laura Tingle and the rest of the talented 7.30 team, is terrific news for audiences.'  Ferguson took up a temporary post in the U.S. capital early last year after being unable to begin her planned role as the ABC's Beijing bureau chief due to poor relations between Australia and China. When she previously hosted 7.30 report in 2014, while Sales was on maternity leave, Ferguson came under fire following a hostile interview with Treasurer Joe Hockey that breached the broadcaster's bias guidelines, an ABC-commissioned editorial review found at the time. Presenting ABC's 7:30, formerly The 7:30 Report, is considered one of the most demanding and high-profile roles in Australian television.  ABC viewers were shocked when Leigh Sales revealed in February she was stepping down as host. In the months leading up to her resignation, the single mother of two was reportedly struggling to balance her demanding job with homeschooling her children. Sales says her decision to quit came down to her 'two beautiful little boys' wanting to see more of their mum.  She told viewers she wanted them to hear the news from her 'personally', as she explained she wanted to finally spend evenings with her kids after more than a decade.  'I was appointed to the job on December 3, 2010. This is my 12th year in the seat. That was five Prime Ministers ago. It was so long ago that Donald Trump was just a guy with a bad orange hairdo hosting The Apprentice,' she said. 'There's nothing wrong other than I just feel a strong sense of it being time to pass the baton to the next runner in the race and to take a break. At the end of an election cycle feels like a good time to move on to something new at the ABC.' She said she hoped it was obvious she had always approached the job with one goal 'to ask frank questions of people in power, without fear or favour, that a fair-minded, reasonable person with some common sense watching at home might like to ask'. In a possible first for an Australian TV news presenter, she then used strong language, saying she had 'tried to shut down and call out bulls**t, hold powerful people to account, expose lies, incompetence and exaggeration in all political parties and all issues and present facts even when they're unpopular or inconvenient'.   Sales said anchoring 7.30 has been 'the most amazing job and I'll never stop being grateful for the opportunities it's given me'. She then mentioned one of her most memorable interviewees over the years. 'The celebrities come and go but you never forget people like Matthew Low,' Ms Sales said. 'His wife was killed in the Dreamworld roller-coaster accident and found the strength down the track to do an interview and try to ensure no other family would have to go through what his family did. 'People like Matthew are the ones who stick with you. 'Every time you interview somebody whose life has been devastated you feel terrified by what life has dished up to them and incredibly humbled by how they met it with strength and clarity and dignity and you just don't forget it.' She did single out one celebrity, though, saying meeting Paul McCartney 'and getting a hug from him is one of the best days of my life'. Ms Sales also mentioned the viewers and how people would approach her in public and say how much joy her interview with McCartney had given them. She spoke about what a demanding hosting 7.30 is and that it comes with a lot of pressure and scrutiny. 'When I first started I didn't have children. And now I have two boys aged 10 and eight. And they've only ever known their mum at work four nights a week. 'They want me home with them before 8.30pm and I don't think that's too much for two little boys to ask and they're two beautiful little boys.' Ms Sales also thanked viewers for their supportive messages about the ABC itself. 'The ABC is so often under fire and it means a lot to all of us to know the public supports us,' she said. She said that 7.30 'is an incredibly important program' and that it will keep going from strength to strength. 'I'm looking forward to having a good break and figuring out what I do next at the ABC ... I'm be around for a while yet.' She finished by saying 'Please keep watching, my friends. See you on Monday. Goodnight.'",
  "af2eea145d612ddfb3d13e406b0bd875bccd7c973c3fcf4a1ff499e7": "Alan Jones has spoken. Scott Morrison has 'no hope' of holding on to power in the May 21 federal election. Three years ago, Jones was the only political commentator in Australia to correctly tip the new Liberal Prime Minister defeating Labor's Bill Shorten.  This time around he says Morrison has no chance to do the same to Anthony Albanese. 'Morrison is the handbrake,' he told Daily Mail Australia of the government's re-election chances. 'The electorate hate him. His own cabinet don't like him. The party know it but it was too late to make a change. 'To keep government, he has to hold every seat he's got and win two more.  'He's no hope. 'He's going to lose seats in Western Australia, South Australia, New South Wales.  'He's upset north Queensland over the Bowen River dam. 'It's the old story. Opposition don't win elections, governments lose them. That's what is happening.' Jones, one of the country's highest-profile conservative broadcasters who ruled Sydney breakfast radio for three decades on 2UE and 2GB, said Albanese's poor start to the campaign won't count at the polling booth. 'Anthony Albanese has been to every pub in Australia,' he said.  'While the government was completely tied up in trying to stop people from getting the flu Albanese was getting out there meeting people. 'They all know him now.' Which is not to say that Jones believes Albanese is the best person for the top job, after he struggled to answer questions about the Reserve Bank cash rate and unemployment. 'There are good people on both sides of politics, but unfortunately they're not in leadership,' he said. Jones, 81, who retired from his top-rating radio career in May 2020 and parted company with Sky News in November last year, has been unusually quiet in recent months after four operations on his back over Christmas, That is about to change. He is planning to bounce back with a vengeance after forming his own digital TV and news network, Australian Digital Holdings. Operating out of a renovated warehouse in Sydney's Chippendale and available free on the ADH.TV app, Jones's first program launches on Monday with guests Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and One Nation leader Pauline Hanson. He says he is looking forward to the freedom of speaking his mind without management interference after years of working for major media organisations. 'At Sky I would get legal letters every afternoon telling me that I couldn't say this or that,' he said. 'We would have to show them the script. The show would be ready to go at 4.30pm and a letter would arrive saying 'you can't say that'. In the end I thought, I don't need this'. After clashes over his coverage of Covid-19, Jones was dumped from his four-nights-a-week program and offered a weekly spot on Sky's streaming service, but he declined the offer. He has been replaced by British media personality Piers Morgan in a worldwide mega-deal, but early figures supplied by Sky suggest the move has not been an immediate success. Jones's first show on Sky drew 109,000 viewers. The first airing of Piers Morgan Uncensored attracted 86,000 viewers, less than the 95,000 that Jones had for his final program. Jones says he wishes Morgan all the best with his show, but has a word of warning about management interefence. 'Piers Morgan Uncensored,' he scoffed. 'I've got news for you, mate.' Jones was previously a speechwriter for former Liberal prime minister Malcolm Fraser and ran as a Liberal state by-election candidate in 1978. He was also a close confidante of former Liberal PM John Howard, who lost the November 2007 election after the Reserve Bank of Australia raised interest rates during an election campaign. The same fate could await Morrison, with three of the Big Four banks - ANZ, Westpac and NAB - predicting a rate rise on May 3 - less than three weeks before voters go to the polls as inflation surges at the fastest pace in 21 years. Howard had won four elections and was in power for 11 years while Morrison, if Jones is proven right, will fail to win a fourth consecutive term for the Coalition after nine years in office, including almost four as PM. Newspoll also shows Labor leading the Coalition 53 per cent to 47 per cent, after preferences. A uniform 4.6 per cent swing to Labor would see the Opposition pick up at least a dozen seats to form a majority government, enough to make Albanese Australia's 31st prime minister. He would also be only the fourth Labor leader to win from Opposition since World War II.   This time, the opinion polls may be proven right. ",
  "9af80b49f99b5c0dbe3b62d4446c351e9ddd23bdc04f13044627363a": "Two Labor frontbenchers have been struck down with Covid-19 three weeks out from the federal election on the same day their leader emerges from a week in isolation. Anthony Albanese made his first public appearance sin a week on Friday after he spent seven days in quarantine at his Sydney home battling the virus. But just as he came out of isolation, his deputy leader Richard Marles tested positive, as did fellow frontbencher Madeleine King.  It means Mr Marles will miss the official launch of Labor's election campaign in Perth this Sunday.  'I was looking forward to travelling west to attend Labor's launch,' Mr Marles tweeted on Friday. 'This morning after taking a routine test for Covid, I returned a positive result. I will be isolating at home + following advice. I'll be back on the trail in no time, fighting for a better future with Anthony Albanese.' Mr Albanese also revealed trade and resources opposition spokeswoman Madeleine King will also miss Labor's campaign launch in her home state. 'More than half my Shadow Cabinet have had Covid now. And at the moment, I think there is at least two of them out,' he told the Today show on Friday. Mr Albanese's first day back on the campaign trail was marred by a Twitter blunder and a live television smackdown by Today Show host Ally Langdon.  The Labor leader shared a picture of his beloved cavoodle, Toto, watching on as he did a series of live crosses to the ABC and the Nine Network's Today Show on Friday morning.  However, the picture was swiftly deleted from social media as it clearly showed the wannabe prime minister's phone number on the dog's collar. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Labor for comment over the deleted tweet. It comes as the Labor leader emerged from isolation after spending the last week isolating at home with the virus - but if he thought he was in for an easy ride with the TV hosts, he was sorely mistaken.  Mr Albanese was grilled on Friday morning about the rising cost of living as inflation hits a 21-year high at 5.1 per cent.  The Opposition Leader said he had been doing some online shopping in quarantine and noted the cost of an iceberg lettuce is now $5.50. He was abruptly interrupted by Today co-host Allison Langdon. 'I don't think people want to hear politicians telling us what the problem is anymore,' she said.  'People are living this every day.' 'They know what the problem is. They want to know how you are going to fix it!' Briefly taken off guard, Mr Albanese insists Labor will fix the issue by plan to address wages while taking a swipe at the Coalition government. 'This government won't even put in submissions supporting a wage increase for aged care workers,' he said. 'We will lift productivity through the national reconstruction fund, by having the NBN operate properly to lift the productivity of businesses, and then the way you can place better profits and better wages.' 'The only way you can do that without placing pressure on inflation is by making sure you have those productivity improvements, and we are aiming at that as well.' Mr Albanese doubled down on his attack of the Coalition over living costs on ABC's News Breakfast.  'We need an economic plan so the economy works for people, not the other way around,' he said. 'This government are happy to claim credit any time something goes right but as soon as things don't, they look to blame someone else and not accept responsibility.  'We will accept responsibility. We will step up and recognise that people are doing it tough.' Earlier, the Labor leader took to Twitter to express his delight to be out of quarantine. 'Out of iso and back at it,' he captioned a photo with Toto before sharing a clip of the cavoodle racing around an oval after a week of being cooped up at home. 'I'm not the only one excited to be out,' he added. It comes amid murmurs that Mr Albanese was somewhat upstaged by his own frontbenchers while off sick.  Campaign spokesman Jason Clare impressed Labor voters and commentators with his strong performance in front of the cameras while Mr Albanese was in isolation.   Mr Albanese will fly to Perth later on Friday ahead of the official launch of Labor's campaign on Sunday.  He told the Today show  he feels 'terrific' after the virus knocked him around. However, he said he isn't in a rush to make up for lost time just three weeks out from the May 21 election. 'It just means being sensible. So, it means if I feel really tired, have a rest,' he said. 'It means doing, perhaps, less things during the day.  'But I expect and the doctors' advice is I'll get better each day and certainly today I feel terrific this morning, and I feel better than I did yesterday and yesterday I felt better than I did the day before. That's what happens.' By Charlie Moore, Political Reporter for Daily Mail Australia Jason Clare has received lavish praise yet again after another impressive media performance - but the odds of him one day becoming Prime Minister are stacked against him. The frontbench Labor MP made headlines last week for his impeccable communication skills in daily press conferences, with many supporters wishing he was leader instead of Anthony Albanese. The cries for him to take over stepped up again on Thursday after he expertly handled a lively media pack and prompted laughter with a witty joke at the expense of Liberal minister Alan Tudge. 'I don't think Scooby-doo could find Alan Tudge at the moment,' he said as Mr Tudge remains away from the limelight after being cleared of abusing his former staffer.  Twitter went into meltdown once again, with supporters and journalists heaping praise on the 50-year-old father of two from western Sydney. 'Loving Jason Clare's media conferences so much,' one user wrote.  'Jason Clare is on fire,' said another who praised his 'wit and humour'.  Mr Clare has also been described as handsome, and even Mr Albanese admitted: 'Jason Clare is certainly better looking than I am. There is no question about that.' But despite his strong performances, the odds of Mr Clare becoming the next Labor leader are long. Tanya Plibersek is favourite at $2.10 followed by Jim Chalmers at $3.75, Kristina Keneally at $6.50 and then Mr Clare at $8, according to Sportsbet. If he wanted to become leader in the event that Labor loses and Mr Albanese resigns, Mr Clare would likely face a messy factional struggle. As a member of the right faction of the NSW division he may have to see off challenges from Shadow Energy Minister Chris Bowen or Shadow Attorney-General Tony Burke who are in the same faction. And then he would be up against Tanya Plibersek who is a leading figure in the NSW Left faction - even before challengers from other states like Mr Chalmers and Richard Marles are considered. Ever since he came to Parliament in 2007, Mr Clare has played down his desire to become leader and those close to him say he is focussed on being a good MP and father. Mr Clare told Sky News in 2014: 'I might be touted but I have no desire to do that job at all' and revealed his 'dream job' would be minister for education.  'For me I feel like I am part of the team and not the leader of the team,' he said. However, Labor sources speaking on the condition of anonymity told Daily Mail Australia that him playing down his ambitions could simply be a smart strategy to win over voters. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern played down her ambitions before she became Labour Party leader seven weeks before the 2017 election. Other Labor sources said Mr Clare's excellent performances have put him front and centre of his colleagues' minds as a future leadership candidate. But right now Mr Clare is focussed on helping Mr Albanese kick out Scott Morrison. Asked last week why he was not in charge, he replied: 'The short answer is Anthony Albanese is the leader this country desperately needs.'  ",
  "4bbc61124247579606046048b6eb760d6e3c4600fda0bf29b67f8c11": "Grace Tame was brought to tears when interviewing Anthony Albanese for a women's magazine - but the pair steered clear of discussing bullying allegations from Labor's 'mean girls'. The advocate for sexual abuse survivors had a friendly chat with the Opposition leader for InStyle Australia discussing everything from Mr Albanese's upbringing, Scott Morrison, gender diversity, the Covid pandemic and Ms Tame's bong photo. But on Friday 2GB broadcaster Jim Wilson questioned why the former Australian of the Year didn't bring up the topic of alleged bullying within Labor's ranks once.  'I wouldn't believe in an in-depth interview you wouldn't ask one question of Anthony Albanese why he didn't launch some sort of an investigation into serious allegations of bullying within their own ranks,' Wilson said on The Today Show on Friday morning. 'The mean girls group.'  Labor has resisted intense pressure to launch an independent inquiry into the alleged bullying of Senator Kimberley Kitching before her fatal heart attack at the age of 52 last month. Senator Kitching's friends claim she was being bullied by senior Labor senators Kristina Keneally, Penny Wong and Katy Gallagher, which they deny. Senator Kitching had dubbed the trio 'mean girls' in reports on the bullying claims, close friends said.  Wilson said: 'I think that's an obvious question I think a lot of Australians want an answer for. We haven't got that.' Guest and former Deputy Prime Minister Wayne Swan interrupted to say: 'It wasn't an obvious question because we have'. Wilson shut Mr Swan down, saying there 'hasn't been a proper investigation, there hasn't been an independent investigation, come on Wayne'.  'If you're committed to a safe workplace, Wayne and a better culture, no doubt if this was happening in the Coalition ranks you would have been all over it,' the radio broadcaster continued.  'It is a cop out that there hasn't been a proper independent investigation into very, very serious allegations. I can't believe that in that interview there wasn't one question.' Mr Swan hit back saying: 'With respect that is just crap.' Wilson had earlier discussed the topic on his Drive show, labelling the exclusion of any mention of bully allegations 'pathetic'. 'The mean girls story rocked Australia,' he said. 'There should have been a proper independent investigation.  'So Mr Albanese, the apparent great protector of women's rights going toe to toe with Grace Tame, and none of them thought it necessary to address the widely reported alleged bullying of women that took place within Labor's ranks. 'To me that is pathetic.' During their interview, the Labor leader recounted to Ms Tame how his single mother, Maryanne, struggled to bring him up in her Camperdown council house in Sydney's Inner West in the 1960s - bringing Ms Tame to tears. Midway through the video link interview, Mr Albanese suddenly broke off his story when he noticed the tears streaming down Ms Tame's face. 'Sorry, I didn't mean to upset you there...' he said. Ms Tame replied: 'No, it's just, yeah, I respect that so much...' She then looked off camera and revealed her fiance Max Heerey was also sobbing over Mr Albanese's story. 'Max is crying! Oh, I want to give you a hug,' she said through her tears. The Labor leader had been speaking about how his mother had been abandoned by her lover who she became pregnant with, then married another girl from his hometown in Italy. But his mother insisted on keeping her son, taking her lover's surname and then pretending he had died in a car crash as she brought Mr Albanese up alone. Ms Albanese scraped a meagre living as a cleaner to keep them both and put her son through university before later being crippled by arthritis and dying at the age of just 65 in 2002. 'It's one of the things that has focused me and a part of who I am,' Mr Albanese told Ms Tame. 'She always respected everyone and I grew up with the confidence of having a mum who lived a lot of her aspirations through me. 'And so she's the most important role model in my life and she's very much still part of who I am today.' The final comment proved too much for Ms Tame who broke down in tears. She later added: 'Oh, I'm still just, I'm still just processing your story. I'll probably go and cry about it later and I'm not ashamed of that!' Mr Albanese said he had 'done okay' and she replied: 'No, you've done better than okay. A lot of respect for you, Anthony.' He added: 'Where I grew up there was a much better chance of going to jail than going to Parliament.'  Ms Tame said she could relate it to her own mother who grew up in Tasmania as the youngest of five girls.  'My nan raised them all by herself for the most part, on a secretary's wage,' Ms Tame told Mr Albanese.  'And they had to do everything themselves.' Ms Tame made headlines earlier this year when she grimaced and side-eyed Prime Minister Scott Morrison at an Australian of the Year function in January.  And she took the chance to have another crack at the PM in the chummy chat with Mr Albanese. 'I've tried to go through this whole interview being very conscious of the fact that I'm talking to you and to avoid criticising old mate Scott,' she said.  'But if I was to make one observation... You've touched on the lack of authenticity, that's one of them. But another is that he just seems to be completely averse to owning any mistakes, and that's a weakness.' Mr Albanese replied: 'It's always someone else.' ",
  "668cac3e749981280447d927daad63d7939997de2f0eacc8a0b21ded": "A new Pfizer pill designed to treat high-risk Covid sufferers is set to hit Australia and will be available in chemists in just days.  The Paxlovid tablets will be given to people with risk factors such as diabetes, obesity, heart, lung, liver diseases, and those more at risk of hospitalisation.  The pharmaceutical company's senior medical director, Dr Krishan Thiru, told the Today Show on Friday the drug is not a vaccine to prevent COVID. 'It is not a vaccine to prevent COVID. It is a treatment for people who have recently been diagnosed,' Dr Thiru said.  The drug is set to fill a gap in the market treating the dreaded disease.  Up until this point, most Aussies with Covid have had to make do with paracetamol and other pain killers normally taken when someone has a cold.  The doctor said the new drug works by stymying an enzyme that helps the virus to replicate.  'It means the virus can't multiply inside your body and so your body's own immune defences are able to combat the virus and reduce the chance in certain patients,' Dr Thiru said.  '[It helps] people who are at high risk of complications, and reduces the chance of those complications,' he said.  These include people over 65 with Covid risk factors, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged over 50 or others who are immuno-compromised.   'It is designed for people who otherwise might be at risk of requiring hospitalisation or not surviving.' Dr Thiru said a similar drug available for general use could be on the horizon but the priority lay with helping the most vulnerable.  'We are continuing to investigate treatments and antivirals in other populations as well, but at the moment we have several thousand people in hospital,' he said.  'And dozens are dying every day and they are the high risk patients, and that's what Paxlovid is for.'  The drug does not replace the vaccine but pairs alongside of it for those who need it the most.  'Vaccination is the most important thing people can do to protect their own health, Dr Thiru said.  'Paxlovid is an important second line of defence, for vulnerable Australians, particularly at high risk.'",

  "2d6434a0a939f2c0f11346947bd5e5a095302b788a5b1e2818092c31": "NYC Mayor Eric Adams partied with Naomi Campbell and singer Jon Batiste at his favorite private members' club as crime continues to soar in the Big Apple.   Adams was spotted dining Wednesday night at Zero Bond, a private members club he regularly frequents, with supermodel Naomi Campbell, Grammy-winning musician Jon Batiste and Hollywood agent Cade Hudson.  LionTree CEO Aryeh B. Bourkoff and Abiola Oke, CEO of Adisa Consultants, were also in attendance. Campbell, posting about the gathering on her Instagram account, said: '#Embracing the Big [Apple] what a welcome!!! and meeting of the minds..@nycmayor @aryehbourkoff @jonbatiste.' The group allegedly discussed 'everything from philanthropy to fashion and music' while they dined at the exclusive NoHo hotspot, insiders told Page Six.  The model, who shared several pictures from the evening, added: 'Thank you Cade Hudson bringing us all together Love & Adore you.'  The mayor seems to be partying hard as New York battles a 42 percent uptick in crime. He was also pictured alongside Mary J. Blige at the grand opening of Brooklyn Chophouse in Times Square on Monday. Adams, a former cop, has vowed to get crime under control and decrease bloodshed throughout the city, one of the key points of his mayoral campaign. Adams ended his fourth month in office with crime and gun violence still on the rise. During a press conference Tuesday, Adams vowed to crack down on transit crimes, which is up more than 60 percent, but also lazy officers patrolling subway stations.  He made the plea when asked by a journalist about reports of multiple uniformed cops being spotted scrolling through phones while on duty guarding the city's crime-ridden transport network. The former NYPD captain warned: 'We are going to start taking very aggressive actions to make sure police are patrolling our subway system and not patrolling their iPhone.' 'If you see it, send me a picture. I'll go to that district the next day and see exactly what is happening. 'Send me a shot. New Yorkers, you see that send me a photo and I will be at that station.' Adams spokesman told anyone with photos to send them to his press office, whose email address is pressoffice@cityhall.nyc.gov. Adams said that New Yorkers can look forward to a 'visible difference in policing in the next couple of weeks.'  He also took aim at the rising crime rates in the city during Tuesday's news briefing. 'New Yorkers have a right to be angry, a right to expect more -- to feel safe, to be safe, to know that your city is looking out for you, your family, and those in need,' Adams said in his speech after his first 100 days in office have been plagued by skyrocketing crime. Felony assaults are up 21 percent than at the same time in 2021, robbery is up nearly 47 percent, rape is up nearly 15 percent, and the percentage of shooting victims is up eight percent, according to the latest statistics from the city's police department. Murders are down just 13 percent. The mayor pointed out that hate crimes continue to be directed at Asian, Muslim, Jewish, Sikh, and LGBTQ+ New Yorkers. 'Our sister Michelle Go was pushed to her death in front of a train in an act of horrifying hatred,' he said, adding that dozens more of 'our New York City neighbors' have been killed by gun violence. Adams named several of the victims, including an aspiring rapper who was executed in cold blood, a 19-year-old girl was killed as she worked the night shift in East Harlem and two police officers who were shot dead responding to a call. 'Their names will echo in our hearts forever: Kristal, Jayquan, Kade, Sally, Angellyah. Detectives Wilbert Mora and Jason Rivera,' he said, pointing out that many of the victims' families were at the speech on Tuesday. 'I can only imagine the loss you feel and the pain you live with,' he told them. 'But I will not rest until we have addressed the conditions that led to that loss. We will do what is necessary to make all of our communities safe. You have my word, as a former police officer, a fellow New Yorker, and your mayor.' Additionally, Adams will be meeting with NYPD commanding officers on Saturday to brainstorm ideas about combatting crime in the city. 'I have a major meeting this weekend with all of my commanders,' the mayor confirmed to The New York Post on Wednesday. 'We're going to sit down for several hours to get our summer plan in order, as well as, think how we deploy police.'  Adams has reportedly requested that all the invited officers bring three plans or ideas that could reduce crime in their patrol areas.  He will also review the latest statistics on crime, summonses, homeless encampment clearings and Civilian Complaint Review Board cases, as well as information on each command's integrity control officer. While Adams is seemingly optimistic about the meeting, one source familiar with the meeting told the Post that commanders have hailed it as a 'joke'.",
  "78ae818231d90bf1c4b61cc1c521601ba90fc828bbd02c2df43788f9": "Donald Trump has made his debut on his Twitter rival Truth Social with a self-deprecating gag about one of his many controversial tweets. The former president wrote: 'I'M BACK! #COVFEFE' in his inaugural post Thursday evening. He accompanied the message with a photograph of himself looking at his phone on an immaculate green croquet lawn outside his Mar-a-Lago country club in West Palm Beach, Florida.   #COVEFE is a lighthearted reference to Trump's 2017 tweet, where he criticized the media coverage of his administration. On May 30, 2017, the then-president wrote on Twitter - which he vowed not to rejoin, despite Elon Musk's $44billion purchase - wrote: 'Despite the constant negative press covfefe.'  The mishap received more than 100,000 likes and retweets each before it was deleted and sparked an internet frenzy.  Now, after more than a year, Trump's social media break has ended after he was banned from Twitter, Facebook and Instagram last year in the wake of the January 6 riots.  He insists he won't return to Twitter, even after it was bought by Elon Musk, who has vowed a far less censorious approach to content moderation, sparking rumors Trump could be allowed back.  'I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,' Trump told Fox News. 'I hope Elon buys Twitter because he'll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth,' Trump said. Representatives for Truth Social said the platform is 'better than being on Twitter' and will be a positive impact within the social media world, but does view it as competition with Twitter.  They hope to take the firm public as part of a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) worth $3.5 billion, although many prospective users say they've struggled to sign up.  'I think it is good. We want liberty and justice and fairness in our country, and the more we can have open, the better, but no, I don't view that as a competition for what I am doing,' he told Fox News.  'This is a platform for my voice. TRUTH is a platform for my voice and for my supporters.'  He also criticized Twitter, before Musk's takeover, for censoring Republicans and limiting the political conversations. He said 'no interactions' were happening and it became 'boring because conservatives were thrown off or got off the platform when I left.' 'It became boring because there was no interaction, the interaction on TRUTH has been amazing,' he told Fox News. 'Truth Social will be a voice for me. And that's something nobody else can get.' In a series of tweets on Wednesday, Musk accused the social media giant of censoring free speech, took shots at its lawyer Vijaya Gadde and bashed Donald Trump's rival service Truth Social for its 'terrible name'. 'Truth Social (terrible name) exists because Twitter censored free speech,' Musk wrote in a tweet, adding, 'Should be called Trumpet instead!' He noted the Truth Social app is currently beating Twitter and TikTok in Apple's App Store, sharing rankings of the most-downloaded free apps. The tycoon had earlier issued a scathing tweet in response to reports Gadde, 48, had been crying at news of the deal. He wrote: 'Suspending the Twitter account of a major news organization for publishing a truthful story was obviously incredibly inappropriate.'    Musk was referring to the suspension of the New York Post's account for its exclusive about Hunter Biden's laptop in the run-up to the 2020 election.  Initially dismissed as 'misinformation' by liberal outlets and social media networks, the laptop and its contents have since been verified by many of the same publications.   Meanwhile, Twitter employees are freaking out in internal chatrooms over Musk's $44billion deal to acquire the firm, messages seen by the New York Post show.  'We're all going through the five stages of grief in cycles and everyone's nerves are frazzled,' one senior staff software engineer reportedly wrote on the company's internal Slack channel. The staffer called Musk an 'a**hole,' and tried to console his colleagues. 'We're all spinning our wheels, and coming up with worst-case scenarios (Trump returns! No more moderation!). 'The fact is that [Musk] has not talked about what he's planning on doing in any detail outside of broad sweeping statements that could be easily seen as hyperbolic showboating,' he added. One site reliability engineer wrote that it was 'physically cringy watching Elon talk about free speech.' A senior staff video engineer announced his plans to quit, saying: 'Not the place to say it perhaps, but I will not work for this company after the takeover.' Musk perhaps did little to allay Twitter staffers fears as he posted several tweets critical of Gadde, Twitter's chief legal officer. She was one of the key executives in the decisions to ban Trump from the platform and censor reporting on Hunter Biden's laptop. ",
  "e1a2e97b27099de72212d6246744a31131681432a4220d036ae1bebd": "Sarah Ferguson will become the new host of the ABC's flagship current affairs programme 7.30 - three decades after she was hired by the public broadcaster as a humble researcher to help her future husband on a project. Ferguson was officially announced on Friday as the replacement to Leigh Sales after the host revealed in February she would step down from her role in June. It marks a meteoric rise for the veteran investigative journalist who first worked with the public broadcaster in a 'sliding doors' moment some 30 years ago.   Former Q&A host Tony Jones had been working as a London correspondent at the time and hired Ferguson to help him on a story about French politics in 1992.  The chance encounter was not only the beginning of a stellar career at the public broadcaster but the start of a romantic relationship that led to marriage and three beautiful children.  Ferguson and Jones tied the knot in 1993 - a year after they first met in Paris.  'It was a 'there you are - I've been waiting for you' moment,' Sarah Ferguson told Mia Freedman on the latest episode of her No Filter podcast.  The pair have been inseparable ever since and have travelled around the world together as they support each other in their roles. The couple spent a year in Rovinj, in Croatia, in 1996 and relocated to the United States when Ferguson landed a role as 'special reporter' in Washington in 2021.  Ferguson officially joined the ABC in 2008 and has produced award winning documentaries, such as 'The Killing Season', for Four Corners.   Over her career - which has included high-profile roles in Washington and documentaries about domestic violence, paedophilia and live cattle exports - Ferguson has garnered a reputation for no-nonsense interviewing. That is what she's expected to bring to the role as she steps into Sales' shoes. It's a role she's reprised before, filling in as 7.30 host for six months in 2014 while Sales was on maternity leave. 'I'm delighted to take on the presenter role at 7.30,' says Ferguson. 'Led by Leigh Sales and chief political correspondent Laura Tingle, the 7.30 team has created a powerhouse program, making superb current affairs journalism on the cutting edge of the genre.' 'Working in collaboration with the inimitable Laura is irresistible. Adding myself into that mix sounds tremendously rewarding at a time when scrutiny of power is essential, when our social structures are undergoing profound change. 'On Leigh's departure, I'd like to say that her diligence and skill have made an enormous contribution to Australian journalism. What you don't see in her calm studio presence is the huge amount of work she does in preparation. It will be a pleasure to take over from such a pro. 'Public service journalism has to deliver for the Australian audience, all day, every day. No one in Australia should ever feel they have no voice.  'It's our job to show how public broadcasting can create a place for everyone to come and debate, think deeply, be thrilled, entertained and sometimes provoked,' Ferguson said.  'This is the opposite of seeking to polarise in ways we are seeing in media worldwide.' ABC managing director David Anderson said audiences 'know and respect' Ferguson. 'Her work has set an unparalleled standard not only in Australian journalism but internationally, as evidenced by her recent reporting from Ukraine,' he said. 'Sarah is an exceptional appointment to take over 7.30 hosting duties from Leigh, alongside an outstanding team. 7.30 has been Australia's premier daily current affairs program for decades and will continue to be so with Sarah at the helm.'  Sarah Ferguson was born in Lagos, Nigeria, where her British-born parents lived before moving to Britain as the Biafran war broke out. Ferguson's career began in newspapers in the United Kingdom, before moving to Paris and working as a researcher and production assistant on arts programs for French and British broadcasters. She met her husband Tony Jones, after he hired her to help him for a story on ABC in 1992, while he was working as ABC's London correspondent . Ferguson had been working as a researcher and production assistant for French and British broadcasters up until that point in time.  In 2000, Ferguson worked as a reporter for Dateline and Insight. In 2004 she joined the Sunday program on Channel Nine and in 2008 joined Four Corners. In 2014, Ferguson hosted 7.30 and her interviews with the Australian treasurer Joe Hockey were nominated for a Walkley for journalistic excellence.  They would later be described as 'aggressive' and 'the tone of the questioning could have been interpreted by some viewers to be a potential breach of the ABC's impartiality guidelines.' In 2014, Ferguson caused controversy at the Walkley Awards when she publicly railed against job cuts at the ABC.  In 2016, she presented award winning documentary 'Hitting Home'. The segment covered domestic violence in Australia and earned Ferguson a Walkley Documentary Award and Best Documentary at the 2016 AACTA Awards.   In 2017, as Ferguson was getting off a plane, she was told that her mother Marjorie had died suddenly in England.  Later she became aware that hospital negligence had led to her mother's death. She wrote about the experience in her book On Mother. Director of News Justin Stevens described her as 'formidable'. 'We're incredibly fortunate with the depth of talent we have at the ABC,' he said. 'Leigh Sales has done a superb job anchoring 7.30 for the past 12 years and to have someone of the calibre of Sarah Ferguson to take up the baton, working alongside Laura Tingle and the rest of the talented 7.30 team, is terrific news for audiences.'  Ferguson took up a temporary post in the U.S. capital early last year after being unable to begin her planned role as the ABC's Beijing bureau chief due to poor relations between Australia and China. When she previously hosted 7.30 report in 2014, while Sales was on maternity leave, Ferguson came under fire following a hostile interview with Treasurer Joe Hockey that breached the broadcaster's bias guidelines, an ABC-commissioned editorial review found at the time. Presenting ABC's 7:30, formerly The 7:30 Report, is considered one of the most demanding and high-profile roles in Australian television.  ABC viewers were shocked when Leigh Sales revealed in February she was stepping down as host. In the months leading up to her resignation, the single mother of two was reportedly struggling to balance her demanding job with homeschooling her children. Sales says her decision to quit came down to her 'two beautiful little boys' wanting to see more of their mum.  She told viewers she wanted them to hear the news from her 'personally', as she explained she wanted to finally spend evenings with her kids after more than a decade.  'I was appointed to the job on December 3, 2010. This is my 12th year in the seat. That was five Prime Ministers ago. It was so long ago that Donald Trump was just a guy with a bad orange hairdo hosting The Apprentice,' she said. 'There's nothing wrong other than I just feel a strong sense of it being time to pass the baton to the next runner in the race and to take a break. At the end of an election cycle feels like a good time to move on to something new at the ABC.' She said she hoped it was obvious she had always approached the job with one goal 'to ask frank questions of people in power, without fear or favour, that a fair-minded, reasonable person with some common sense watching at home might like to ask'. In a possible first for an Australian TV news presenter, she then used strong language, saying she had 'tried to shut down and call out bulls**t, hold powerful people to account, expose lies, incompetence and exaggeration in all political parties and all issues and present facts even when they're unpopular or inconvenient'.   Sales said anchoring 7.30 has been 'the most amazing job and I'll never stop being grateful for the opportunities it's given me'. She then mentioned one of her most memorable interviewees over the years. 'The celebrities come and go but you never forget people like Matthew Low,' Ms Sales said. 'His wife was killed in the Dreamworld roller-coaster accident and found the strength down the track to do an interview and try to ensure no other family would have to go through what his family did. 'People like Matthew are the ones who stick with you. 'Every time you interview somebody whose life has been devastated you feel terrified by what life has dished up to them and incredibly humbled by how they met it with strength and clarity and dignity and you just don't forget it.' She did single out one celebrity, though, saying meeting Paul McCartney 'and getting a hug from him is one of the best days of my life'. Ms Sales also mentioned the viewers and how people would approach her in public and say how much joy her interview with McCartney had given them. She spoke about what a demanding hosting 7.30 is and that it comes with a lot of pressure and scrutiny. 'When I first started I didn't have children. And now I have two boys aged 10 and eight. And they've only ever known their mum at work four nights a week. 'They want me home with them before 8.30pm and I don't think that's too much for two little boys to ask and they're two beautiful little boys.' Ms Sales also thanked viewers for their supportive messages about the ABC itself. 'The ABC is so often under fire and it means a lot to all of us to know the public supports us,' she said. She said that 7.30 'is an incredibly important program' and that it will keep going from strength to strength. 'I'm looking forward to having a good break and figuring out what I do next at the ABC ... I'm be around for a while yet.' She finished by saying 'Please keep watching, my friends. See you on Monday. Goodnight.'",

  "b2d0d4bb7c8c31ad8bb6faae913363cecb25d9ab8782669f11386cc6": "Vladimir Putin has launched a new dpuble missile attack at Kyiv during the visit of UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres just two days after he sat down with the Russian dictator in Moscow.  At least one person was killed and several injured, including some who were trapped beneath the rubble in the western part of the city centre, according to rescue officials. The bombardment came barely an hour after President Zelenskyy held a news conference with the UN Secretary-General, who said Ukraine has become 'an epicentre of unbearable heartache and pain.'  A spokesperson said Guterres and his team were safe. Guterres had visited Putin on Tuesday in order to discuss the urgent need for Russian forces to permit humanitarian corridors for civilian evacuations.  The missile strike can be viewed as Putin's non-diplomatic response to the request.  Mayor Vitali Klitschko said the Shevchenkivskyi district in the northwestern part of the city was hit twice, causing fires in at least two high-rise buildings.  AFP correspondents saw black smoke pouring into the air and a building in flames with a heavy presence of police and rescuers in the area. 'Missile strikes in the downtown of Kyiv during the official visit of @antonioguterres,' tweeted Mykhaylo Podolyak, a senior aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. 'The day before he was sitting at a long table in the Kremlin, and today explosions are above his head,' Mykhaylo said referring to Guterres' visit to Moscow where he met Russian President Vladimir Putin a few days ago. The United Nations chief and Ukrainian president had been out surveying the destruction in small towns outside the capital that saw some of the worst horrors of the first onslaught of the war.  At a press conference just before the missile strikes, Guterres condemned the atrocities committed in towns like Bucha, where evidence of mass killings of civilians was found after Russia retreated in the face of unexpectedly stiff resistance.  He said Ukraine has become 'an epicentre of unbearable heartache and pain.' 'Wherever there is a war, the highest price is paid by civilians,' Guterres lamented, reiterating the importance of investigating alleged war crimes.  Appearing to be one of boldest attacks on Kyiv since Russian forces retreated from around the capital weeks ago, the explosions came as residents have been increasingly returning to the city.  Cafes and other businesses have reopened, and a growing number of people have been out and enjoying the spring weather.  The strike on the Ukrainian capital comes as the Russian offensive in the Donbas region gathers steam.  Several areas came under heavy shelling Thursday, amid suspicions Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to score a major battlefield success in time for Victory Day, one of Russia's proudest holidays, on May 9. Ukrainian authorities reported intense Russian fire in the Donbas - the eastern industrial heartland that the Kremlin is bent on capturing - and near Kharkiv, a northeastern city outside the Donbas that is seen as key to the offensive.  In the ruined southern port city of Mariupol, Ukrainian fighters holed up in the steel plant that represents the last pocket of resistance said concentrated bombing overnight killed and wounded more people.  Authorities warned that a lack of safe drinking water inside the city could lead to outbreaks of deadly diseases. ",
  "153ba7dc138046c7a79c1b5a76d83a77fdc7092b8d089ff28bdf8e19": "The denial could not have been more emphatic. Three months ago, the Daily Mail asked if Angela Rayner had been at the infamous Durham bash where Sir Keir Starmer glugged beer with cronies. At the time, it was subject to a police inquiry amid claims Labour's leader had broken lockdown rules. The answer was blunt: Mrs Rayner - notorious for calling Tories 'scum' - was not there. This week, we discovered the opposite was true. Photographs revealed the deputy leader brazenly taking part in a Zoom rally at the constituency office. Confronted with this irrefutable evidence yesterday, Labour made a humiliating confession: They'd made a mistake. That the party has been caught shamelessly lying is emblematic of the rank hypocrisy pervading every aspect of this shifty affair. In politics - as in normal life - standards matter. Labour's leader certainly believes so. For months, he has launched scathing personal attacks on the Prime Minister over Partygate. Indeed, when Boris Johnson received a fine for attending what the police deemed a lockdown-busting birthday gathering, he almost burst with puce-faced piety. No matter that, in the midst of battling the pandemic that nearly killed him, Mr Johnson's colleagues presented him with a cake (which never left its Tupperware). For Sir Keir, this was a hanging offence. For flouting his own Covid rules, the PM should resign, he declared pompously. Boris did not 'tell the truth'. But now we know that when it comes to the highest standards, Sir Keir and his sermonising acolytes have got feet of clay. They supported the draconian laws with an almost religious fervour. Now Sir Keir faces damaging questions over the event last April when indoor socialising was banned. Was it coincidence that party members held an online 'quiz and social' event on the evening he was there? Risibly, he claims he was working. The very defence he called 'pathetic' when the PM used it. What a shameless hypocrite! No wonder senior Tories are demanding detectives review their controversial decision to clear him of wrongdoing. When the regulations should be interpreted consistently, the ruling smacks of double standards. And now we know that Labour's No 1 and 2 were at the scene, isn't it time the police woke up? Labour have banged on about the importance of uncovering the truth about Partygate. But when it comes to being held to account for their own potential rule-breaking, they lash out. How else to explain a Labour MP accosting a Tory backbencher in Parliament for having the temerity to ask the police to probe the Durham rally with the same rigour he demanded for the PM? If it was so innocent, they'd surely welcome a scrupulous investigation to put the matter to bed. Of course, this is not the first time Mrs Rayner has been caught out. When The Mail on Sunday reported that she had joked about flashing her legs to try to distract Mr Johnson during PMQs, she furiously denounced the story as untrue. How odd! Because she herself had earlier volunteered the information for a national podcast. And, as the Mail revealed, no fewer than four MPs - including one woman - say they heard her laughing about the same subject on the Commons terrace in January. Their powerful testimonies bring a unique force to this version of events. Yesterday was a day of sleaze and shame for Labour. An ex-Cabinet minister was suspended for bullying and a shadow minister was accused of making disgusting sexual innuendos about a female MP. For weeks, Labour MPs have clutched their metaphorical pearls so hard over Partygate their fingers have been in danger of breaking. Now we know they are just as bad.",

An official from a pro-Russian committee which styles itself as the region's 'military-civil administration' announced the move via Russian news agency RIA. Kirill Stremousov said the transition to the rouble will take up to four months, during which time it will circulate alongside Ukraine's official currency, the hryvnia. This week Russia said it had gained full control of the southern region. Russia appointed its own mayor in the city of Kherson on Tuesday after taking over regional headquarters. But Ukrainian mayor Ihor Kolykhayev said on Facebook he had defied Russian orders. 'I am staying in Kherson with the people of Kherson who entrusted me with the management of our city,' he added. 'I refused to cooperate with the new administration.' It was announced that the powers of 'Kherson mayor are delegated' pursuant to the order of the regional military commander of the Russian Federation to Oleksandr Kobets. He will in turn report to the new head of the 'Kherson regional administration', Volodymyr Saldo. Mr Kobets said that from this week he would coordinate all the processes that ensure the functioning of the city. Mr Kolykhayev said that he had asked the Ukrainian President's Office for detailed instructions on what the mayor and his colleagues should do in response to the current situation. It comes as Russian forces used tear gas and stun grenades to stamp out a pro-Ukraine rally in the occupied city on Wednesday. The protest had been organised on the day Kyiv said Russian planned to stage a referendum to create a breakaway region like those in eastern Ukraine. Thousands of people have fled Kherson to Ukraine-controlled territory amid water outages, severe shortages of food and medicines.",

Online posts claimed some of the women are 'wives and girlfriends' of servicemen fighting in Ukraine. Their snaps in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine were posted on Instagram and Russian social media site VK.

Jahden Nelson, 28, is fighting for his life in the burns unit at the Middlemore Hospital in Auckland, New Zealand. The young father suffered a heart attack and burns to 35 per cent of his body following an electrical shock at a Massey worksite last Tuesday. A neighbour said Mr Nelson was taking apart scaffolding and holding a steel pole when it touched a low-hanging powerline that electrocuted him. His mother, Toni Paikea, said the voltage was like an atomic bomb exploding in his body. 'It went from one arm, through the other arm and straight down through his leg and thigh,' she told NZ Herald. Mr Nelson's cousin held the unconscious tradie until paramedics arrived and took him to Auckland City Hospital. He underwent surgery before he was transferred to Middlemore Hospital. Ms Paikea said her son had both his arms amputated and that he could possibly lose. more limbs. Only one person is allowed to visit Mr Nelson at a time due to the increased risk of spreading infection.  'It's the hardest thing a parent could go through,' she said. 'It's a life and death situation. I'm holding my son's heart in my hands.'  Questions have been raised around the worksite safety with the family demanding answers as to why Mr Nelson was working beneath live wires. Ms Paikea said her son had been working in the industry for 12 years and that he was extremely knowledgeable of health and safety protocol. She claimed her son would have believed the powerlines had been cut off and that he would not have been working had they not been. Employer Supercity Scaffolding has offered to pay for a car park at the hospital and distribute food vouchers. Lines company Vector has also given the family $1,000 in fuel vouchers. WorkSafe has launched in an investigation into the incident. Ms Paikea has set up an online fundraiser to raise money for her son. 'He is a young father to three beautiful children his youngest turning only one year old in a few weeks, a humble family man, dedicated all round guy, loved by many friends & family,' she wrote.

  "a2b5760b9e8343f38d16461b30a8e1ef89ee03da9d9f3e46b8e5349b": "William Tyrrell's foster parents will proceed to trial on charges of assaulting and stalking a child after it was revealed that police have a 'large amount of surveillance device material' and up to ten prosecution witnesses. Sydney's Hornsby Local Court heard on Friday that the little boy lost's foster mother will apply to have her charges heard under the Mental Health Act, while the foster father will not. The charges include stalking and intimidation offences against the foster parents which date from earlier this year. They relate to another child who is not William.  Police prosecutors today were criticised for not having a brief ready yet on a 'serious' charge of child assault which detectives laid against both the foster mother and father last November. The foster mother's lawyer Sharon Ramsden told the court she had not yet been able to get a mental health assessment appointment for the 57-year-old, which will determine if she qualifies to be judged as mentally impaired.  The foster father's lawyer Lauren MacDougall told the court she would not be pursuing a mental health application on his behalf.  Both foster parents will present just one witness each to defend the charges. The foster couple were facing court for the first time on charges of stalking the same child who police allege they assaulted last year, along with Apprehended Violence Orders taken out by police for the child against the parents. The foster father is accused of one count of stalking and intimidation intending fear of physical harm against a child, while the foster mother faces two charges. Police allege the assault against the child, whose identity cannot be revealed for legal reasons, occurred last year.   The identities of the foster parents - well-educated professionals in their 50s who live in a comfortable suburb on Sydney's north shore - can also not be publicly revealed.   The new charges came as the NSW Police Force continues to focus on what happened to William, who vanished from his grandparent's home in Kendall, NSW, on September 12, 2014. The foster parents had been charged with assault and intimidation of a child and with lying to the NSW Crime Commission last November.   The stalking charges followed former NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller naming the foster mother as a 'person of interest' in the toddler's disappearance.  The shift in the focus in trying to solve Australia's biggest unsolved murder mystery occurred after Strike Force Rosann head Gary Jubelin was replaced by Detective Chief Inspector David Laidlaw. Although police did not formally interview the foster father until six days after William disappeared, Mr Jubelin conducted separate gruelling three-hour interviews with them in 2017, three years after the toddler vanished. Mr Jubelin later said he had 'confidence' they were not involved. in 2019, two years after those interviews, the foster parents testified before the NSW Coroner's inquest into the missing boy. The focus of the inquiry was on a Kendall neighbour who has since been discounted as a person of interest and on convicted paedophiles of the NSW mid-north coast.  The foster mother gave evidence over two days, while the foster father gave shorter testimony of about an hour.  The foster mother's lawyer, high-profile Sydney solicitor Sharon Ramsden, told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday her client would likely plead not guilty to the stalking charge. Ms Ramsden said the woman would also plead not guilty to another charge of falsifying information to the NSW Crime Commission, just weeks after her husband was laid with the same charge. The 57-year-old was issued with a court attendance notice by NSW Homicide detectives, and has been ordered to appear at the Downing Centre on May 24. The charges of stalking and intimidation intending fear of physical or mental harm are domestic related, according to court documents.  While the investigation into the toddler's 2014 disappearance continues, the couple  held a fire sale of children's bikes, car seats, prams, furniture and industrial equipment with items ranging between $5 and several thousand. It was only revealed last month that William's foster father had been charged in January with two counts of 'knowingly providing false and misleading evidence'.  The charges only came to light because of a revision of non-publication orders surrounding the case.  The foster father, who police claim 'lied about something we can prove', gave the allegedly false evidence to the NSW Crime Commission late last year, and it is understood the foster mother also testified around the same time.    Details of the evidence provided to the NSW Crime Commission by the foster father which police claim is false and misleading are unavailable. The foster father has entered pleas of not guilty to both charges.  He testified for up to two hours after being secretly summonsed to appear at the Crime Commission's Surry Hills headquarters on November 11. This was four days before NSW Police launched a surprise 'high intensity' search of bushland around 800m from the house where William had been staying with his foster parents when he vanished seven years ago.  On the second day of the search for William's remains at a dig site in Kendall, the boy's foster mother was declared a person of interest in his disappearance.     Last month, William's foster mother was charged with another count of common assault of a child, which also does not relate to William, and her lawyer has indicated she will plead not guilty.  William had been placed with the couple in March 2012 as a foster child in the care of the then state minister for family and community services until he was 18 years old. William was driven to the Kendall home of his foster grandmother on Friday, September 11, 2014 and was last seen playing on the verandah of the house on the Saturday morning. A widespread search in the surrounding area failed to find any trace of him.  Last November, a new and extensive search for William's remains at Kendall began  and continued for four weeks. Police, SES and rural fire workers along with detectives from Strike Force Rosann spent four weeks late last year digging up a section of forest less than a kilometre from the house where William vanished. Combing bushland and digging with excavators, police searched along Batar Creek Road, Kendall for William's remains and scraps from the SpiderMan suit he was last seen wearing.  The foster mother denied any involvement in William's disappearance and no charges have ever been laid against any person.",

Miquiel Guerrero, 23, was arrested on March 30 after he and five others surrounded the unidentified victim, 53, and his car after they crashed into each other on Exterior Street in the Grand Concourse neighborhood. A man cops say is Guerrero was then filmed brutally-attacking his victim while wearing knuckle-dusters while his posse jumped on the man's car and stole it. The van driver made no attempt to fight back.   Shockingly, Guerrero has since been freed back onto the streets, despite the horrific nature of the violence meted out on his alleged victim. He's due back in court May 23 on a misdemeanor charge, amid ongoing fury over New York's soft-on-crime laws that critics blame for a recent spike in violent crime.  Surveillance footage shows the group circling the victim, with one jumping on top of the car, as Guerrero swings the driver's door open and begins to violently punch the victim.  Police records indicate Guerrero wrapped a metal object around his knuckles when he pummeled the man, who suffered a shattered left eye and bruising in the face, nose and back. Officials did not specify what the object Guerroro used was.  It is also unclear if he has any prior convictions.   After being beaten, the 53-year-old can be seen running away from the scene and two men enter his Kia and begin to drive off with it. While three others hop in an unoccupied Honda that was caught in the crash, according to the New York Post.   Guerrero, who stayed on the scene for unknown reasons, was later arrested and charged with assault, menacing, criminal possession of a weapon and harassment.  Police are now looking for the other group members, all aged between 18 and 25, according to authorities.  The victim was transported to Jacobi Medical Center and was treated for a fractured eye socket and facial cuts.   It comes as New York is in the middle of a crime surge, with overall crime up 42 percent. The Big Apple is an increasing problem with carjacking up 68 percent and felony assaults up 21 percent.  Earlier this month, NYC Police Commissioner Keechant L. Sewell 'this is not what New Yorkers expect or deserve, and we will not stand for it' as crime continues to terrorize New Yorkers.  'It's clear what we are confronting: A perception among criminals that there are no consequences, even for serious crime. We need tangible changes,' added Sewell.  NYC Mayor Eric Adams has now vowed to crack down on transit crimes, which is up more than 60 percent, but also lazy officers patrolling subway stations.  Adams made the plea at a press conference Tuesday when asked by a journalist about reports of multiple uniformed cops being spotted scrolling through phones while on duty guarding the city's crime-ridden transport network. The former NYPD captain warned: 'We are going to start taking very aggressive actions to make sure police are patrolling our subway system and not patrolling their iPhone.' 'If you see it, send me a picture. I'll go to that district the next day and see exactly what is happening. 'Send me a shot. New Yorkers, you see that send me a photo and I will be at that station.' Adams spokesman told anyone with photos to send them to his press office, whose email address is pressoffice@cityhall.nyc.gov. Adams said that New Yorkers can look forward to a 'visible difference in policing in the next couple of weeks.' ",
  "cda67d635f27fc3da3a67da71dd77d7aa5063001e5304567b3a7e618": "Lawyers for the man accused of shooting 10 people on a Brooklyn subway have accused the FBI of violating his rights by swabbing him for DNA and making him sign papers without informing his attorneys.  Frank James, 62, is charged with conducting a violent attack on a mass transportation vehicle following the April 12 attack. He faces life in prison if convicted. Arrested on April 13, James is currently being held without bail in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, and James's lawyers claim that on Tuesday FBI agents entered his cell and questioned him, without following proper procedures. Mia Eisner-Grynberg and Deirdre von Dornum of the Federal Defenders of New York filed a complaint on Thursday, claiming that the FBI entered James's cell for questioning without alerting them before or after. They also took swabs of the inside of his mouth for DNA, made him sign documents, and failed to provide James with a receipt for the interaction.  Further details on the nature of the questioning, or the reason for the swab, have not been revealed.   'Contrary to standard practice, the government committed this intrusion absent advance notice to counsel, depriving us of an opportunity to be heard or to be present,' his lawyers wrote. 'Neither did the government provide subsequent notice to counsel.  'The agents did not provide Mr James with a copy of the warrant or a receipt, in violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure.' Prosecutors from the Eastern District of New York have been given a week to explain. James's lawyers said they would ask the court to withdraw from file whatever statements he made in his Tuesday interview with the FBI. They also asked the judge to order the government to turn over a copy of the affidavit that served as the basis for the search.  Prosecutors say James staged a premeditated attack when he shot ten people and injured others on the northbound N train at around 8.25am on April 12, during rush hour.  James, dressed in a construction worker's vest and helmet, donned a gas mask and rolled smoke grenades into the carriage before opening fire. Videos from the scene showed hundreds of commuters frantically running for the exits as shots were fired.  A nearly 24-hour long manhunt for James then ensued, with the Bronx-born, Milwaukee-based suspect ultimately arrested while strolling down the street on April 13. In court documents the next day, prosecutors detailed how more ammunition was found in James' rented Philadelphia apartment, including an extended round magazine that was fit for a semi-automatic rifle. No such firearm has been found yet in connection with the suspect.  His 9mm handgun was found at the 36th Street subway station after the attack, along with spent shell casings, fireworks, and a key to his U-Haul.  Police also searched a storage unit in Philadelphia, where he was keeping more ammunition, a torch and a gun silencer.  There was a propane gas tank in the U-Haul when police swooped in on it hours after the attack.  James dumped the truck five miles from the 36th Street subway. He was filmed walking away. James' motive remains unknown.  James had a criminal history extending back to 1992, when he pleaded guilty to attempted petit larceny and was known to the FBI's Guardian Program, which tracks terror threats and suspects, over an incident in New Mexico in 2019.  At the time, he was cleared of wrongdoing.   But in a YouTube video posted just one day before the attack, James said he wanted to harm people. 'I can say I wanted to kill people. I wanted to watch people die,' he said.  Other videos featured James ranting about discrimination and complaining about white people.  They are now being closely examined by law enforcement. Mayor Eric Adams has suggested that it was the responsibility of YouTube to monitor the videos and report them. 'There's a corporate responsibility hen we are watching hate brew online,' Adams said.  'We can identify [hate] using artificial intelligence and other methods to identify those who are talking about violence.' Critics accused Adams of passing the buck, noting that the surveillance cameras in the station were not working - allowing James to flee - and that NYPD failed to find him, despite his wandering around Manhattan for almost 24 hours after the attack and eventually calling the police himself.

  "99cd42b33a357c41d6976fd081a253dbb1074f8280eb7893b169cdf5": "New video of scandal-ridden GOP Rep Madison Cawthorn having his crotch felt by a close male friend and staff member is at the center of a complaint calling for an investigation into him and filed with the Office of Congressional Ethics today, DailyMail.com can reveal. The extraordinary footage, obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com and seen here for the first time today, shows Cawthorn, 26, in a car with his close aide and his scheduler Stephen Smith, 23. Cawthorn sits in the driver's seat apparently filmed by Smith as he adopts an exaggerated accent and says, 'I feel the passion and desire and would like to see a naked body beneath my hands.' The camera then pans back to Smith who says, 'Me too' as Cawthorn can be heard laughing. Smith then films himself reaching his hand over and into Cawthorn's crotch. The video is one of several exhibits filed in support of the ethics complaint drafted by political group Fire Madison Cawthorn. Cawthorn appeared to allude to the scandal on Thursday in a tweet which said: 'Many of my colleagues would be nowhere near politics if they had grown up with a cell phone in their hands.'  The complaint calls for an investigation into a slew of behaviors that, the group alleges, has put Cawthorn firmly on the wrong side of a host of House Rules. Among the many allegations is the claim that representative for North Carolina's 11th district provided thousands of dollars in loans and gifts to Smith, a staff member, with whom, the complaint states, he is engaged in an improper relationship characterized by steamy postings on social media and so close that the staffer joined Cawthorn on his honeymoon to Dubai in April 2021. According to the filing Cawthorn has provided free housing, travel and loans to Smith, none of which have been declared or repaid. The complaint also requests an investigation into the nature of Cawthorn's relationship with Smith stating that the junior member of staff lives with Cawthorn. A campaign payment to Smith submitted in Cawthorn's FEC filing and attached to the complaint gives Cawthorn's Hendersonville North Carolina house as Smith's home address and DailyMail.com has separately verified that Smith is indeed registered as living there. In addition to this living arrangement the filing claims that, 'various social media postings by them indicate a personal relationship between them, separate and apart from the professional relationship of employer and employee.' In fact, according to the ethics complaint, Smith's relationship with Cawthorn is so close that the younger man joined Cawthorn on his honeymoon to Dubai in April 2021. Approached for comment Cawthorn's spokesman Luke Ball said he could not give any response until he had seen the video. He said Smith and Cawthorn are cousins. A picture included in the exhibits filed in support of the call for an ethics investigation appears to show Cawthorn and Smith, poolside. Cawthorn lounges covered with only a towel, his arm draped over Smith who rests his head on his boss's shoulder and places his hand on Cawthorn's hip. Another picture shows the men enjoying a 'snow day' together with Smith sitting next to Cawthorn on an ATV, his arm placed around Cawthorn's shoulder. Cawthorn, who is confined to a wheelchair following a 2014 car accident, married Cristina Bayardelle, 27, in April 2021, just weeks after he had been accused of sexual harassment by a number of former students at Patrick Henry College, the northern Virginia college he attended in 2016 for just one semester. At the time Cawthorn described marrying the 27-year-old anesthesiologist assistant and CrossFit athlete as, 'the greatest honor, privilege and adventure of my life.' The pair were married in a private ceremony in front of a large wooden cross, garlanded with flowers. Cawthorn stood with the aid of a walker and exoskeleton to make his vows and kiss his bride. Bayardelle, originally from Florida, claimed she knew 'he was the one' after just four months of dating. But eight months later, in December 2021, the couple announced they were divorcing with Cawthorn placing the blame for the split on his elevation to political office. 'When my wife Cristina and I were engaged I was not a member of Congress. I felt called to serve and we both agreed that I should run,' he said in a press statement released at the time. He claimed they had sought counseling to deal with the 'enormity' of the change his election brought to his life but that ultimately, they had agreed to split when they realized that 'balance was not attainable,' and 'that we had irreconcilable differences between us.' Records reviewed by DailyMail.com show that Smith was living at Cawthorn's Hendersonville, North Carolina, home throughout the representative's brief marriage. A Venmo payment history between Smith and Cawthorn, attached to the ethics filing and dating from June 2018 is littered with suggestive messages in the form of notes attached to the payments. One payment made by Cawthorn to Smith and dated June 17, 2018, reads, 'Getting naked for me in Sweden.' Another made by the representative to his staff member four days later reads, 'The stuff we did in Amsterdam.' The following day on June 21 Cawthorn made a payment to Smith for, 'The quickie at the airport.' Four days later Smith makes a payment to Cawthorn 'For loving me daily and nightly.' One note on a payment made by Smith to Cawthorn on December 13, 2018, reads simply, 'Nudes.' It is not clear if the two twenty-somethings added those tags as a joke. Cawthorn, who represents a wide swath of western North Carolina in Congress, is the youngest member of Congress in more than half a century.  He has become an increasingly embattled figure in recent weeks during which there has been what Fire Madison Cawthorn co-founder David Wheeler calls a 'deluge' of scandal. Leaked pictures emerged in which he was seen, possibly intoxicated, wearing women's lingerie at a party. Two recent speeding violations - one for 'extreme speeding' another for driving on a revoked license - have brought his tally of citations to more than a dozen with court dates looming. On Tuesday he was stopped at Charlotte's Douglas International Airport attempting to take a loaded Staccato C2 handgun through TSA in his carry-on. Last year he was stopped trying to board a flight at Asheville Airport with a Glock 9mm handgun that was not only loaded but had a round chambered and ready to fire. On Wednesday North Carolina Republican Senator Thom Tillis called for him to be investigated for insider trading over his relationship with meme cryptocurrency Let's Go Brandon. Last December Cawthorn posted an Instagram picture of himself with LGB leader James Koutolas and the caption, 'LGB legends...Tomorrow we go to the moon!' The following day NASCAR driver Brandon Brown announced that the cryptocurrency would be his primary sponsor for the 2022 season and its value spiked by 75 percent. Tillis has asserted that this suggests that Cawthorn who owned the cryptocurrency was aware of the development in advance and called for an investigation. It is all just part of what Tillis, 61, has called Cawthorn's, 'consistent pattern of juvenile behavior, outlandish statements and untruthfulness.' This apparent 'untruthfulness' reached a new level when he told a right-wing YouTube channel host that unnamed Republicans in Washington, 'in their 60s and 70s' had invited him to 'orgies' and that he had witnessed them snorting cocaine. A red-faced Cawthorn was forced to admit that this was an 'exaggeration' after a 30-minute tongue-lashing from the Republican minority leader, Kevin McCarthy. For his part McCarthy called the stories, 'untrue' and said that the once-rising star had lost his trust and needed to 'turn his life around.' According to Wheeler, while much of the scandal has tumbled out over the past few days, his group's desire to speed Cawthorn's downfall predates it. Wheeler told DailyMail.com, 'This all started pre lingerie, pre speeding, pre the guns...there's been a deluge of things recently but [Cawthorn's behavior] is not recent. He's been doing this stuff for a while.' He added, 'We stick to the facts. We don't do conjecture. Essentially what's happened is he's been violating House ethical rules first of all by providing free housing for one of his staff. 'You can't gift more than $250 to a friend and House rules say you can't give gifts to other House staff. 'But it's tens of thousands of dollars because the guy - Stephen L Smith - has lived in his [Cawthorn's] house here in Hendersonville at least since he took office.' In addition to their concerns about Cawthorn's alleged gifts and loans to Smith and the nature of his relationship with his staffer the Fire Madison Cawthorn complaint has also called for an investigation into both of his attempts to bring loaded firearms onto flights and an attempt to bring a '4.45inch dagger' to North Carolina public educational property on four documented occasions. All these actions are, the complaint asserts, violations of House Rule XXIII and reflect negatively upon the House. The filing has also called for a separate investigation into Smith who, as the recipient of free housing and travel from Cawthorn in excess of $250 as well as gifts and loans, has allegedly failed to submit proper House financial disclosures. Ultimately, Wheeler told DailyMail.com that the group is motivated by a desire to 'hold Cawthorn accountable' for behavior that, he says, has escalated to the point where Cawthorn is a danger to himself and others. He said, 'We began working on this around April 2021 with the sole purpose of holding Cawthorn accountable. 'Think about [what's happened recently]. It's not hyperbole to say that this guy's a danger to the public with his driving and his guns. 'The gun [in the airport] was loaded - both times - and one of them was chambered so it was ready to go! 'Somebody's going to get hurt. This guy is either going to kill somebody or he's going to kill himself through his irresponsible actions and that's the worst part of it and I don't think he has any clue. 'He just seems completely in his own world and detached from reality in a way that's [become] frightening.'",
  "efa5102781d1d178810476a609c7f96436e2ebc28319241c55bab9d3": "Vladimir Putin is secretly plotting to seize food in occupied areas of Ukraine to fill shelves in Russia after Western sanctions sparked crippling shortages. The plan was accidentally revealed by a Kremlin puppet parliament, which said Moscow will confiscate crops from farmers to help stock stores across Russia. It will revive the horrors of Ukraine's Holodomor, or 'hunger extermination', when Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin stole food to create the 1932-1933 famine, killing at least four million people. In a now-deleted statement, pro-Putin regional politician Vladislav Zyryanov said the Kremlin wanted 'to increase the volume of supplies for domestic Russian consumers by moving food from other southern [Ukrainian] regions taken under its control'. Zyryanov, who chairs the agriculture committee in the Krasnoyarsk regional assembly in Siberia, called the move 'economically justified, given the withdrawal of many suppliers of seeds and fertilisers from the Russian market'. He suggested other regions across Russia will be able to 'successfully implement' similar policies to address the nation's food supply woes. His remarks are the first time any Russian official has openly admitted Russia wants to steal Ukrainian farm produce. They also amount to an unprecedented acknowledgement by Putin's United Russia party of the biting effect from sanctions imposed by Britain and its Western allies. Zyryanov's statement was hurriedly taken down from the Krasnoyarsk assembly's website late on Wednesday. Both the UN and EU have accused Russia of using hunger as a weapon of war by bombing food stocks and blocking deliveries of humanitarian supplies. It is why the record-breaking Mail Force Ukraine Appeal and the Ukrainian Embassy in London are sending 500,000 boxes of food aid worth PS8million to end the suffering of Ukrainians. Kherson's highly productive and lucrative agriculture industry is one of the reasons why Ukraine is referred to as the world's bread basket. In the admission, desperate Siberian MPs said the move to steal Ukrainian 'crop surpluses' was necessary due to 'the lack of other vegetables and grain crops' in the eastern Russian region. But they added that foreign sanctions had created similar shortages 'everywhere at the federal level'. Albert Cherepakha, owner of two major farming businesses in Kherson, described how his firms have been seized by 'groups of armed Chechens'. He said: 'The gunmen said that from now on the company property belongs to them.' He added his managers 'were warned that they would be beheaded in case of any losses'. And Oleksandr Boyko, 23, a Kherson farm worker, said there had been 'no significant excess production' of vegetable, fruit and grain products. The Ukraine Agri Council, representing Ukrainian farmers, said last night Russian invaders had started seizing grain from the Zaporizhzhia region. Ukraine's food exports have slumped in the two months since the war started, causing prices to spike worldwide by at least 37 per cent, according to the World Bank. Dr Samuel Ramani, a Russia expert at the University of Oxford, said regional MPs in Russia never 'act out of lockstep' with the Kremlin on issues of national security. Just over two years ago, all 85 regional parliaments backed constitutional changes that will allow Putin to run again for presidency in 2024. Dr Ramani said: 'When a regional parliament is speaking, it is reflecting the Kremlin line and revealing Vladimir Putin's true intentions in Ukraine. He sees this area and all of its resources effectively as an extension of Russian territory. 'From his point of view, there is no difference between taking something out of Kherson or drilling for oil in Siberia.' The Kremlin's press office could not be immediately reached for comment.

  "590d8eedf9c4795a66a6b1de59fda56706c25b3c5f13c5598c80d6f0": "Blac Chyna's mother branded the Kardashians as a 'violent' family that is trying to paint her and her daughter as 'crazy people' at Chyna's ongoing defamation trial.  'I mean they are the most violent people,' Tokyo Toni said of the Kardashian-Jenner family while standing outside a Los Angeles courthouse where her daughter's defamation trial was underway on Thursday. 'You can turn it on and see.' 'Any of them, all of them,' she argued, noting how Kris Jenner's adult daughters are often seen disrespecting her on their family show, Keeping Up With the Kardashians. Tokyo, seemingly hinting at her social media rant that resulted in her removal from the courtroom, also denounced the accusations that she and Chyna are 'crazy people'. 'They are the most violent people. They have me and her like we're these crazy people, no we're just standing up for our rights,' Tokyo stated. 'Doing what we're supposed to do as real people. It has nothing to do with race, color. None of that. It's what's right.' Chyna, 33, is suing Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner for defamation, alleging they conspired to cast her as a violent abuser of her former fiance Rob Kardashian to ruin her television career. Tokyo, 55, was banned from attending the hearings hours after jury selection began when she took to Instagram Live detailing what went down in the courtroom. She also allegedly said 'those b**ches ugly' when referring to the Kardashian-Jenners. The Kardashians' lawyer presented Tokyo's comments to the courtroom the next day, alleging she had threatened the family and that 'Ms. Jenner was worried about her physical safety.' Tokyo's commentary comes just two days after Chyna's defamation trial heard testimony that the model had allegedly beaten Rob Kardashian with a metal rod. Rob, 35, testified Tuesday that he feared for his life on a night in 2016 when Chyna, his then-fiancee, pointed a gun at his head, pulled a phone-charging cable around his neck and repeatedly hit him with a metal rod while under the influence of substances. He said the coupling was 'toxic' from the start, and that Chyna beat him at least five times during the year-long relationship.  'She strangled me, she put a gun to my head twice, she was on cocaine and alcohol,' Kardashian said, his voice rising nearly to a shout in a Los Angeles courtroom as Chyna's attorney Lynne Ciani sought to cast doubt on the attack and its severity. 'Strangling someone, beating someone, that's not a family,' he said. 'That's not love to me.' He told the courtroom that he felt in retrospect that the couple's love was never real, and that he had been at the 'weakest, worst point' in his life when their relationship began in January 2016. Rob's sister, Kim Kardashian, echoed the tale, claiming that she remembered him being 'so emotional and upset' after the alleged attack. The E! Network, which aired both Keeping up with the Kardashians, and its spinoff Rob and Chyna, paid Chyna $370,000 to film four episodes of KUWTK after season one of the latter show ended. But that deal was inked without consulting the Kardashians, said Kim who protested in an email that at E!, 'Nobody listens to us...No one respects us', the court heard.  She then reportedly urged her sisters in a text to 'get on the phone today' with E! executives following the December 2016 fight. 'I was upset that Rob was so emotional and upset,' the Kim, 41, explained to jurors at Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday. 'I remember trying to be supportive of my brother - he was being so emotional.' 'It's all such a blur,' she said, remembering that her brother, Rob, 'looked red and puffy and exhausted and drained.' Kim added: 'It was our show and she's not a family member.' Khloe Kardashian, 37, confirmed her sister's allegations on Tuesday, testifying that she too was worried about 'something crazy happening down the line' if there were a second season of the KUWTK spin-off.  'I know it was a metal rod. I saw red indentations on my brother's neck,' Khloe recalled, adding that her family had 'no control' of whether E! would cancel Chyna's contract - a claim later confirmed by Adam Stotsky, the former president of the network. 'With all due respect to [the Kardashians], they do not have the authority to kill Rob and Chyna, only E! has the power to do that,' Stotsky said in court. Kylie Jenner, 24, also testified to Chyna's alleged violent tendencies, telling the jury on Monday that she expressed concerns to her brother Rob about his new girlfriend and soon-to-be reality TV co-star when they started dating in January 2016. The beauty mogul claimed she heard Chyna had a tendency to abuse drugs and alcohol and become violent and had gotten a possible glimpse of it herself. 'I felt it was my duty to express my concerns, but ultimately it was up to him,' Kylie recalled, noting her brother didn't heed her warnings and continued with the relationship. Both Chyna and Kylie had previous relationships with the rapper Tyga, and Chyna had a child with him.  Kylie alleged that Tyga told her dark stories of his time with Chyna and showed her a 6-inch knife scar he said she gave him while abusing drugs and alcohol. The model also claimed that while dating Tyga, she had received at least one threatening text message from Chyna. 'From what I remember she sent me a bunch of devil emojis, and said something like 'counting down the days' until she could beat me or something,' Kylie shared. 'I didn't report it, because I assumed they were empty threats.' She also said didn't trust that Chyna's love was genuine. 'I felt like me dating the father of her child had something to do with it, and maybe she was out with my brother for other reasons?' Still, she said, she was cautiously optimistic after they announced in April 2016 that they were getting engaged, and said in May that they were having a baby together. 'I was happy for my brother at the time,' Kylie said, 'but just curious how it would go.' Judge Gregory W. Alarcon, who is residing over the defamation trial, made the decision Thursday afternoon to move on to closing arguments after denying Chyna's bid to redo her testimony against the Kardashians. The model had became upset and walked off the stand during her testimony last week when she was shown a nude photo of herself during cross-examination.  The photo had appeared in a restraining order she received against Rob in 2017. The Kardashians' attorney showed her the document with the photo during his questioning of her. The judge said both sides agreed to all the exhibits, including the restraining order, before the trial. Chyna's attorney Lynne Ciani said she didn't agree to it in that form, stating: 'I emphatically insisted that the naked photo not be presented to the plaintiff.' The photo is central to another trial that will begin soon after this one concludes. Chyna is suing Rob over it, alleging he posted it online out of retribution. After he denied Chyna's to take the stand again, Alarcon began reading the jury instructions in the case late Thursday morning.  Closing arguments were expected to begin, and be completed, in the afternoon.  Chyna is charging the Kardashians with defamation and 'intentional interference with contract' that led to the KUWTK spinoff being canceled and is seeking $108million in damages. She claims she the decision resulted in $44million in past lost revenues and $64million in future.",
  "6d48c409bc8721ff940e720f0b4a5a926a29c54bf699b42061c497c0": "Former Disney CEO Michael Eisner appears set to unload his own Magic Kingdom as his California property is set to be up for a massive sale.  The Malibu compound, which features 16 bedrooms and a stunning nine guest houses, is now on the market for what would be a state record $225million. Eisner, 80 - who now runs Tornante Pictures and is Chairman of English League One football club Portsmouth - originally bought the first piece of land in the mid-1990s and have been adding adjacent land parcels ever since. The estate, designed by architect Robert A.M. Stern, includes nine separate structures, including a main house and several guesthouses. It also features a movie theater that can only be accessed by a tunnel. It has a stunning total of 16 bedrooms and 28 bathrooms across the main house and guesthouses, as well as a two-bedroom caretaker's cottage.  Kurt Rappaport, the listing agent, told the Wall Street Journal the cost was warranted because the entire scale of the compound would be nearly impossible to replicate today in terms of location and beach access.  Rappaport, who represents Westside Estate Agency, said that the property has an oceanfront cabana that can only be accessed by a cliff-side elevator.  The estate was gradually constructed over a period of decades and finally finished in 2020. The finishing of the project is behind Eisner's desire to sell, according to Rappaport, who said that the ex-Disney CEO 'loves the creative process' and wants to find a new project.  Eisner also owns a ranch in Snowmass, Colorado, a mansion in Bel-Air and an apartment on the Upper East Side of New York.  Other homes in the Malibu area have sold for shocking prices in recent years. In 2018, a property owned by Hard Rock Cafe founder Peter Morton sold for $110million.  Eisner ran Disney from 1984 to 2005, overseeing a revitalization of the studio from films like Who Framed Roger Rabbit to the famous 90s animation renaissance of The Little Mermaid, The Lion King and Pocahontas.  He also worked at Disney acquired everything from Miramax Pictures to ABC to ESPN and Pixar.  After Disney, Eisner has The Tornante Company, which has invested in everything from Topps baseball cards (which they sold to Fanatics earlier this year) to television shows like Netflix's Bojack Horsemen. He also hosted a talk show, Conversations with Michael Eisner, from 2006 to 2009 on CNBC. Since 2017, he has served as owner of Portsmouth FC, who play in the third tier of the English football system.  ",
  "907fb802b19ab1d8cba89b64d3c68bd4cbf3bfe347581510fbb3dd42": "Disney has restored a gay kiss scene in its new movie Lightyear after a furious backlash from staff, as the firm continues to tussle with Florida over Governor Ron DeSantis's so-called Don't Say Gay bill. The kiss happens between Buzz Lightyear's friend Alisha Hawthorne (Uzo Aduba) and another female character within the first 30 minutes of the film, which was shown to audiences at CinemaCon on Wednesday.  They subsequently confirmed that the smooch had been restored.   Hawthorne reportedly meets her love interest after her and Buzz land on a strange planet and later alludes to her getting married to her. She reportedly can be heard saying: 'It's funny, I wouldn't have met her if we hadn't been stranded,' according to USA Today.   The kiss was previous removed from the film before being reinstated after workers at Pixar Studios - which is owned by Disney - sent a letter to Disney CEO Bob Chapek, accusing the company of hiding same-sex affection.  'Nearly every moment of overtly gay affection is cut at Disney's behest, regardless of when there is protest from both the creative teams and executive leadership at Pixar. Even if creating LGBTQIA+ content was the answer to fixing the discriminatory legislation in the world, we are being barred from creating it,' Pixar employees wrote in a March letter to the company.  In addition, at least four recent feature films were altered to appease the views of leadership in China, Russia and the Middle East.  Sources close to the production told Variety that while Hawthorne's relationship was never questioned, studio execs opted to axe the kiss in an apparent move to avoid controversy. Insiders allege the decision to keep the kiss could be a turning point for Pixar, which has only featured a handful of 'unambiguous LGBTQ characters' in its 27-year history. But, it remains unknown if Disney will opt to censor the scene for its international markets after its release this upcoming June.  The company has previously kept moments of LGBT affection in its American films, but removed or changed them in its more conservative markets, including in Russia and the Middle East.  Pixar released Onward, an animated feature that tells the tale of two elf brothers who embark on a magical quest to spend time with their late father, in February 2020. The film included a secondary character, Officer Spector, a cyclops cop for the city of New Mushroomton, who was in a lesbian relationship.  Officer Spector, voiced by Lena Waithe, mentions her relationship during a parenting discussion with another secondary character: 'It's not easy being a new parent - my girlfriend's daughter got me pulling my hair out, okay?' The line sparked outrage is several eastern countries, resulting in a ban of its release in Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, Deadline reported. Russia, which has a history of censoring gay content, changed the word 'girlfriend' to 'partner' in the parenting scene. Local advertisements for the film also avoided mentioning Officer's Spector's gender.  Meanwhile, members of the LGBT community have heralded Officer Spector as Disney's first openly gay character.  The Marvel franchise, which is owned by Disney, included a same-sex kiss in Eternals, a November 2021 superhero film based on the Marvel Comics race of the same name. The character of Phastos, the inventor of the community of genetically-engineered Eternals, is married to a man named Ben Stoss. Together the pair raise a son, Jack. In one scene, Phastos is seen kissing Ben. But, according to Out.com, that moment was edited out for audiences in the Arab Emirates, Egypt, Lebanon, Iraq, Jordan, Ethiopia, Palestine, Syria and Turkey. The countries did, however, keep other scenes in which Phastos interacts with his husband and son. It is unclear if the familial relations between the characters were defined. Out.com notes that in addition to the same-sex kiss, all scenes of physical intimacy, including those depicting heterosexual relationships, were also removed from the film, which is standard practice in those countries.  Another Marvel film, Avengers: Endgame, which was released in 2019 and grossed nearly $3billion worldwide, was also censored abroad. Early on in the film, there is a brief scene in which a gay character attends a support group meeting with Captain America. 'So, I went on a date the other day. First time in five years,' the character said, before adding later: 'He cried as they were serving the salad. But I'm seeing him again tomorrow.' It was the first time an openly gay character appeared in a Marvel film.  According to Russian newspaper TJournal, the nation's dubbed version of Endgame changed the dialogue to remove 'romantic overtones'.  In the Russian version, the character says: 'I was recently at dinner. First time in five years. [...] He cried over a plate of salad. [...] Tomorrow I'm meeting him again.' The newspaper also claimed Disney may have changed dialogue in Marvel's 2018 film Avengers: Infinity War to avoid additional conflict with the Russian government, however it is unclear what the nature of the dialogue was. Similarly, Pixar was accused of downplaying gay tones in its 2021 film Luca, which details the friendship of two young sea monsters who appear human when on land. The monsters, Luca and Alberto, develop a 'profound friendship' that many interpreted as a 'coming out allegory'. The film's director told The Wrap the studio had 'talked about' the monsters' relationship being romantic, but also noted officials 'didn't talk about it as much' because the film focuses 'on friendship' and is 'pre-romance.' 'Some people seem to get mad that I'm not saying yes or no, but I feel like, well, this is a movie about being open to any difference,' director Enrico Casarosa added.  Disney has reportedly refused to confirm if the pair were in a gay romance. The films bosses are also accused of having toyed with the idea of making character Giulia, a human girl who befriends Luca and Alberto, a lesbian but decided against it because the creative team was 'stymied by how to do it without also creating a girlfriend for the character.' 'We very often came up against the question of, 'How do we do this without giving them a love interest?'' a production source told Variety. 'That comes up very often at Pixar.' Disney has also been accused of cutting the majority of inclusive scenes in the 2022 Pixar film Turning Red, which was a coming of age story about puberty. Pixar employees allege there was misrepresentation in the animated film and that it was riddled with 'ambiguous possibly gay hinting,' according to InsideTheMagic. Several employees have called on the studio to 'release the Gay Cut' of the film. It is unclear what specifically the alleged gay scenes depicted, however critics have posted stills to social media of scenes in which two female characters have their faces just inches apart. Disney came out against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis's so-called 'Don't Say Gay' bill, whose official title is the Parental Rights in Education Bill, last month after facing immense pressure from staff members. The bill prohibits public school instruction on gender and sexuality between kindergarten and third grade. Supporters say the bill, which was signed into law in March, stops teachers from pushing inappropriate content on children, which they believe students may be too young to understand. Opponents say the bill is homophobic, and that the vagueness of its wording could see a teacher reported to authorities for something as minor as mentioning their same-sex partner in class. Disney initially stayed quiet on the bill. But the firm - which has long had a good track record on supporting its LGBT staff - is said to have waded into the issue after being pressured by woke in-house diversity factions now said to exert growing influence over bosses there. CEO Bob Chapek later spoke out after walkouts by a small number of Disney staffers - and angered DeSantis by openly suggesting that his firm would apply pressure on lawmakers. After blasting the bill, he said: 'As I wrote to our employees earlier this week, we are committed to supporting community organizations like these so they are equipped to take on these fights. 'Meanwhile, we are also reassessing our approach to advocacy, including political giving in Florida and beyond.'",
  "87531f695f8892f0538f8a09f02cbfb4b670e7c8c0a456e25c757ae7": "Vice President Kamala Harris is feeling good and back to sorting through her files at the VP's official residence after testing positive for COVID-19. First gentleman Douglas Emhoff tweeted out a picture of Harris Wednesday night. She can be seen grinning, pen-in-hand, wearing a cream colored blouse inside the residence at the Naval Observatory in Washington.  She is holding a blue ink pen in her right hand.   'Thanks to everyone who sent well wishes for @VP,' wrote Emhoff. 'She is feeling good and is working from home.' The vice president's office has already reported that she is not experiencing symptoms. The White House said Wednesday she was being given Paxlovid - a drug that can reduce severe infections and hospitalizations.  The administration is urging people infected with the virus to reach out to their doctors to see if they are eligible for the drug. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that's what Harris did when questioned about why the VP was getting the drug while not experiencing symptoms.   Psaki fielded another question about the drug Thursday, when asked about the logistical issues. The drug can only be administered within three days of a positive test. Psaki batted down the idea of having people be able to get the drugs in advance. 'It requires a prescription right, but there are a range of ways to have those conversations with your doctor. So I'm not sure it always involves a race to the doctor's office, but different doctors can have virtual appointments and other means of getting prescriptions. It's about consulting to ensure you're eligible,' Psaki said. She also spoke about the White House push for billions in new COVID funds to get the next generation of drugs on the shelf. President Biden didn't take a position when asked Thursday about Senate leaders combing legislation with his request of $33 billion for Ukraine.   'I'm not here to set new deadlines, but I can tell you that both needs are urgent. Well, I would say that need is urgent as is the need for COVID funding is urgent,' Psaki said.  Harris may be finding time during quarantine to catch up on her reading. On the corner of her desk was a copy of Douglas Brinkley's book, American Moonshot. It chronicles the Space Race from early rocketry through the space program in the 1960s. Harris heads the president's space council.  Harris' desk also contains multi-colored sticky notes, two binders, and an iPhone turned upside down. On the wall is a framed newspaper article about her. A box of Kleenex can be seen near her land-line telephone. Her legal pad doesn't have any writing on it. The photo was a demonstration that Harris was still able to fulfill her duties, although she is unable to preside over the Senate during quarantine. (Two Senate Democrats also tested positive, inhibiting the party's ability to take actions).",
  "ee27a4ea2f262a19df43f6f87d84f44f99761b640f4b37552a4e776d": "A top JPMorgan executive has told his staff they can work from home three days a week, after workers at the multinational bank complained the company was tracking their in-office ID swipes in an effort to force them to come back. Drew Cukor, an executive at the bank's artificial intelligence machine and learning and engagement wing, sent out a memo to 'CTO and TRAIN members' on Tuesday. 'The Firm has heard from many around the business...and we're making a few adjustments,' he said, according to a copy of the memo obtained by Insider. 'Effective immediately: We are now authorized to invite our workforce to two days a week in the office.' It is unclear what the team acronyms refer to. JPMorgan Chase did not immediately respond to requests for comment from DailyMail.com. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has been adamant about getting workers back to the office, even as some have talked to the media about their experiences being 'forced' back into the office by supervisors who have had the 'fear of God' put into them. But last month, Dimon conceded that 'working from home will become more permanent in American business,' adding that 40 percent of the company's 270,000 employees could work a few days at their desk. Mayor Eric Adams of New York City, where JPMorgan is based, has urged companies to call their workers back to the office, calling it crucial for the city's 'financial ecosystem.' In the letter dated Tuesday, Cukor said he expected his workers to meet the 'generous modification' requiring them to go into the office two days a week with 'earnestness.' Many employees are reportedly on hybrid rotas where they only go in for three days a week. 'I know many are working effectively from the office, from home and everywhere in between. I'm grateful for everyone's hard work and patience over these last few months.  'Productivity and delivery of effective solutions to our business partners is always top priority alongside the health, safety and happiness of each member of our team,' he wrote. Cukor joined the bank last year after serving in the US Marine Corps for 25 years, serving in multiple roles. He was the head of Project Maven, which focused on developing computer vision algorithms to process drone footage, FedScoop reported. Last week, four sources told Business Insider that JP Morgan workers were having their ID swipes checked to ensure they were going into the office.  One London-based worker said: 'At JPMorgan, nobody trusts you. The higher-ups don't trust you to do your job if they're not constantly watching you in the office.' Another, more senior member, said even managers were not keen and had left them 'deathly afraid' of their teams not having 100 per cent attendance. They said: 'I don't know whether it's because they themselves are too timid or whether it's because the fear of God has been put into them by a bank manager.' They added: 'But every time there's something that requires participation, you sense the panic.' The two sources reportedly said they were looking to leave the company. In a recent letter to shareholders, CEO Dimon said 50 percent of the bank's employees around the world would have to return to the office full time. About 10 percent could work from home forever, he added, while the rest could get by on a hybrid model. Meanwhile Goldman Sachs has also reportedly been looking at ways to coax workers back in the office. Sources told DealBook bosses had talked about the idea for younger bankers at their weekly meetings. They were apparently mulling over scheduling in-office appointments so they had to attend in person. Last month junior Goldman Sachs bankers whose salaries start at $110,000 threatened to quit their jobs after the firm demanded they turn to the office five days a week. 'In Goldman Sachs, the top management says it's employees choice but internally they track which team has most in office attendance,' an employee wrote on the message board Blind, according to New York Post.  'It's f***ing bulls**t from top management saying they are people first,' they added. 'In our team meeting, manager showed us the excel where the MDs [managing directors] are tracking which department has not met in-office commitments.'  Another Goldman Sachs employee wrote on Blind: 'Apparently they are tracking everyone's attendance and managers are getting lists of people who have low attendance so they can bully them into coming in.'  The investment bank demanded employees return to the office five days a week earlier this month, after CEO David Solomon branded working from home an 'aberration'. 'It's an aberration that we're going to correct as quickly as possible,' Solomon said last year. 'The CEO has repeatedly argued that remote work 'is not ideal for us, and it's not a new normal.' Meanwhile this month Goldman Sachs scrapped Covid perks for New York City-based staff including a free car to and from work, as well as free lunches. The upcoming policy changes, made by CEO David Solomon, comes after the Wall Street giant put an end to two years of free lunches and breakfast at the office. Both were designed to incentivize workers to come work in-person amid COVID-19 and a surge in crime in New York. New York City Mayor Eric Adams stressed in February the need to get workers back to offices. Adams seemed to allege he was seeing many people going from work-from-home Monday to Friday, to going out on the weekends. 'You can't tell me you're afraid of Covid on a Monday and I see you in the club on Sunday,' Adams joked. The mayor previously told leaders of major companies in the city to prioritize getting workers back in the office to stimulate the city's economy. 'In order for our economic - financial ecosystem, I should say - to function, we have to have human interaction,' Adams said at an economic development event at the Brooklyn Navy Yard in February, according to Insider. 'It can't be done from home. And if we do that, then we're going to greatly impact low wage workers.' He added: 'You can't stay home in your pajamas all day.'",

Luis Medina, 30, was taken into custody around 11:30 a.m. Saturday for allegedly stabbing a 41-year-old woman multiple times during a domestic dispute at 65 East Gun Hill Road as crime continues to surge in the city.  Medina was taken to Bronx Hospital to be treated for minor injuries and handcuffed to a hospital bed.  While the suspect was being treated by a nurse, 26, he began acting erratically and grabbed a pair of scissors from her hand and hit her in the head with them, NYPD said. The 26-year-old nurse was not seriously injured and fled the room to get help. Medina is then seen on video jumping out of the hospital bed with his wrist still handcuffed to the bed as he attempts to slash at the cop.  When he slips and falls, one of the cops uses a Taser on Medina before fleeing the room for backup.  Medina faces multiple assault charges and criminal possession of a weapon, according to the NYPD. The woman who was stabbed in the Bronx was was taken to Saint Barnabas Hospital, where she was in serious but stable condition, NYPD said.",
  "197c56e868c3a0562dbbba840db00100cc66287c510549ce45e78108": "The WhatsApp message sent by a senior Labour press officer could hardly have been clearer. Asked by the Daily Mail if the party's deputy leader Angela Rayner had been present at the Durham Miners Hall the evening Sir Keir Starmer enjoyed a beer with local MP Mary Foy and other comrades, the spokesman replied categorically: 'Angela wasn't there.' But now that simple claim has been undermined, ironically by Labour's own digital campaigning prowess. Last night, in an astonishing volte-face, Labour belatedly admitted that Mrs Rayner had been there, but gave no further details. The party's about-turn came after a Mail investigation had already established that despite the denials, the party's deputy leader had been in the Miners Hall. Almost a year since the fateful event, when lockdown laws at the time banned indoor socialising except within a household or support bubble, the party's Facebook page still shows a video that proves Sir Keir and Mrs Rayner were in the same building at the same time. It can be revealed today that less than an hour before the infamous video was taken of Sir Keir with bottle in hand, he and his deputy sat at the same desk to address Labour activists across the country. They were the star turns in a live online rally being held less than a week before the country went to the ballot boxes in the pair's first major electoral test. It was advertised by frontbencher Nick Thomas-Symonds in a social media post that can still be viewed today. 'Tune in 8.30pm-9pm tonight for Labour's Get Out The Vote '6 Days to 6th May' rally with Keir Starmer, Angela Rayner and special guests,' he wrote on Twitter on the afternoon of Friday, April 30. He helpfully included a link to the Facebook page hosting the virtual campaigning event, which not only remains online but includes a complete video of the 48-minute proceedings. It was hosted by Labour MP Carolyn Harris, broadcasting from her home in Wales. She made it clear the rally was live by announcing: 'Well, hello everyone and welcome to the very last Friday before May 6.' After her introduction she handed over to Sir Keir, who was wearing the same open-necked white shirt which would later be seen in the clip filmed by passers-by as he drank a bottle of beer. As he addressed voters by webcam, he was sitting in a small room with white walls and a mirror on a mantelpiece that showed the reflection of a distinctive 'half round' fanlight window. Sir Keir gave a six-minute speech to the 16,000 watching online, saying: 'Let me just start by thanking every single person who's on this call this evening. Thank you for joining us.' He said the party was facing 'huge, huge elections', the first since the 'devastating' national poll in December 2019 - which saw Boris Johnson rout his predecessor as Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. Sir Keir claimed the upcoming elections would pit his Labour Party against a 'Conservative Party that's up to its neck in sleaze'. After the rally heard from other speakers, including one in the US, host Miss Harris handed over to the final speaker - Angela Rayner. She appeared on screen in front of the same background Sir Keir had sat in front of less than 20 minutes earlier - the same white walls, the same mirror on the mantelpiece and the same window in the reflection. And she even confirmed exactly where she was, quoting the motto of Durham Miners. 'Being here at the Miners Hall in Durham, I've got to start with 'the past we inherit, the future we build',' Mrs Rayner said. As well as hosting the 'Pitman's Parliament' in decades gone by and being the headquarters of the Durham Miners' Association, the grand Edwardian building is also used for constituency meetings by Mrs Foy. And it is where the party has admitted Sir Keir was when he was caught enjoying a drink with colleagues, including Mrs Foy, in an apparent breach of Covid rules at the time as well as government electioneering guidance that stated: 'You should not meet with other campaigners indoors.' That video was shot a little after 10pm - less than an hour after Mrs Rayner addressed the online rally from a room there. Photos of the hall show that its ground floor has the same distinctive fanlight windows that can be seen in the background of Sir Keir and Mrs Rayner's pieces to camera. The full 43-second clip of the video revealed by the Mail this week shows Sir Keir in another room of the hall, swigging from a bottle of beer and listening to Mrs Foy while two men eat food by the doorway. A woman sitting facing the two Labour MPs had been named by social media users as Joy Allen, then campaigning to be Durham crime tsar. But she has denied being present and the evidence obtained by the Mail suggests the woman is Mrs Rayner. When this newspaper first asked the party's press office in January about Mrs Rayner's possible presence, the reply was unequivocal: 'Angela wasn't there.' But the deputy leader had also shared photos and videos of herself with Sir Keir in the building at the same time. She was wearing the same polka-dot dress as she wore during the online rally and earlier that day while out canvassing hundreds of miles away in Birmingham. The next day - at 8.53am on Saturday, May 1 - she posted two photographs of herself in front of miners' lodges banners at the hall and wrote: 'Last year was the first year in two decades that I couldn't come to Durham. It's good to be back!' Then at 9.45am she shared a video - which again is still online - of herself and Sir Keir touring the building which Labour claims she had not stepped inside. It began with him declaring: 'On International Workers' Day, we're at Redhills, the historic Durham Miners Hall.' Mrs Rayner was filmed outside the building saying: 'From here in Durham to the miners in South Wales, it was working people and trade unionists who created local healthcare systems that laid the foundations for our country's greatest institution, the National Health Service.' The morning after the indoor event, Sir Keir and Mrs Rayner were pictured in hard hats and hi-vis jackets as they visited a major building development in Durham, known as Milburngate.",
  "470a107d11e0bf268738cd82f9111b092716d57b272d3fae53ba8d5b": "Tens of thousands of Australians will become reinfected with Covid-19 as new sub-variants of Omicron emerge ahead of winter, experts have warned. NSW recorded its first case of the BA.4 strain on Thursday with the BA.5 sub-variant also expected to reach the country within the next couple of months.  Both strains are variants of Omicron and have led to a sharp uptick in Covid-19 cases in South Africa.  University of Melbourne epidemiologist James McCaw warned the rise of new variants meant people who had been struck down with Covid-19 could be reinfected. 'We will get reinfected, and we are most likely to be reinfected by new versions of the virus which are immunologically different,' he told Sydney Morning Herald.  'It's going to happen more and more because it's the only way for the virus to establish itself. It will be around forever because of reinfections.'  UNSW's School of Public Health and Community Medicine James Wood said transmissions would spike across the country within the next couple of months. 'BA.4 and BA.5 in South Africa are clearly causing cases to go up, and we can expect these are already here in low numbers,' he said.  Some states have already published reinfection rates with thousands of residents already struck down with the virus twice. Victoria has reported 10,000 reinfections between December and March. The Northern Territory recorded 28. NSW has yet to publish its data while Western Australia and Queensland does not keep track of it. Professor Wood said unvaccinated residents were the most likely to be reinfected. Children aged under 12 would be particularly vulnerable with low vaccination rates among the group. Only 39.5 per cent of children aged between five to 11 have received two doses of the vaccine while 52.8 per cent have received their first dose. The warning comes as states phase out isolation rules for close contacts.  NSW, Victoria and the ACT have already ditched the requirement and Queensland followed suit at 6pm on Thursday. Western Australia became the second-last state or territory to abolish quarantine for asymptomatic COVID-19 close contacts, in line with national guidelines, at 12.01am on Friday. South Australia will from Saturday drop the need to isolate unless showing symptoms. Fully vaccinated close contacts in the NT no longer need to isolate unless they are symptomatic. Tasmania will drop the seven-day isolation requirement for close contacts of Covid-19 cases from May 2.",
  "afeb4965d7a8ce8e50d2fbf832824992d4bf1a9de39e4a6f5f375ff7": "Elon Musk called on Thursday the creation of Joe Biden's new 'disinformation' board 'discomforting' as the president tapped a Russia misinformation 'expert' to lead the initiative. The billionaire, who just acquired Twitter this week, was responding to a tweet from conservative political commentator, comedian and media personality Steven Crowder. 'The government is creating a misinformation governance board,' Crowder tweeted on Thursday. 'Who else did something like that?' he continued. 'Oh I remember, the Nazi's. And there's some data showing some interesting things going on post- @elonmusk's Twitter takeover!' Nina Jankowicz was brought on to lead the Department of Homeland Security's Disinformation Governance Board to combat disinformation related to national security - and she expressed concerns last week that Musk expanding free speech on social media would be bad for 'marginalized communities'. On Wednesday, Jankowicz defended her previous remarks casting doubt on the validity of the Hunter Biden laptop scandal. Republican Senator Josh Hawley is demanding that the White House 'dissolve' the new Department of Homeland Security's Disinformation Governance Board she is heading, claiming that it would only 'monitor Amerians' free speech'. A tweet Jankowicz sent in October 2020 has resurfaced and is making the rounds in conservative circles. 'Back on the 'laptop from hell,' apparently- Biden notes 50 former natsec officials and 5 former CIA heads that believe the laptop is a Russian influence op,' she tweeted at the time. She added: 'Trump says 'Russia, Russia, Russia.' She now claims that the tweet was part of her 'live tweeting' a debate between Trump and Biden just one month before the presidential general election as Republicans are using the post to pounce on her political leanings. 'For those who believe this tweet is a key to all my views, it is simply a direct quote from both candidates during the final presidential debate,' Jankowicz defended in a repost of the original tweet. 'If you look at my timeline, you will see I was livetweeting that evening,' she added in the Wednesday night tweet. Jankowicz confirmed reports on Wednesday that she is being brought on as executive director of the new board at DHS. Republicans immediately blasted the move, claiming she has shown too much bias to head the group - specifically in casting doubt on Hunter's laptop scandal. In October 2020, Jankowicz called the laptop stories a 'Trump campaign product.' Senator Hawley insisted on Thursday that the board should be dissolved before it even gets started. 'I write with deep concern about the Department of Homeland Security's decision to create a new Disinformation Governance Board,' he penned in a letter to DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. 'I confess I at first thought this announcement was satire,' he continued. 'Surely no American Administration would ever use the power of Government to sit in judgment on the First Amendment speech of its own citizens.' 'Sadly, I was mistaken.' He then demanded that DHS provide more information on this new board, including how it will function and be monitored. Hawley also questioned why the announcement was made just following billionaire Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter, which he vowed to make a more free speech platform with all ideas. Jankowicz was critical of Musk buying Twitter, claiming that more free speech on the social media platform was a negative thing. Wisconsin Republican Senator Ron Johnson sent a statement against the formation of the board. 'The Biden Administration has not proven itself to be a credible arbiter of 'disinformation.' Instead, it has taken steps to silence information that is unflattering to this Administration under the guise of 'disinformation,' Johnson wrote. 'For example, unnamed intelligence officials, the media, and social media platforms engaged in a coordinated effort to censor stories about Hunter Biden's laptop and his questionable financial dealings under the false label of 'disinformation.' 'I am concerned DHS's Disinformation Board will only serve to silence or censor those voices critical of your disastrous policies and serve a political cover for your failure to secure the border,' the senator concluded. Mayorkas did not disclose any powers that would be granted to the dystopian-sounding board while addressing lawmakers on Wednesday. He explained that the board would work to tackle disinformation ahead of the November midterms, particularly in Hispanic communities. He also said that the board would come under the Biden-era Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships (CP3), meaning it would have no powers to crack down on disinformation and will instead try to combat it by throwing money at what it sees as problems. The CP3 program provides communities with resources and tools to help prevent individuals from radicalizing to violence. Last year, CP3 awarded about $20 million in grants through its Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention Grant Program. It is unclear how much cash will be spent on the Disinformation Board. Mayorkas noted that the focus of the new board would be to stop the spread of misinformation in minority communities, including election misinformation ahead of the 2022 midterms.  He added that it would focus on the latest trend of misinformation allegedly targeting Spanish-speaking voters. No further details on the exact misinformation being deployed against these communities was shared.  Jankowicz, who revealed she was the head of the department following Mayorkas' meeting with lawmakers, tweeted: 'Cat's out of the bag: here's what I've been up to the past two months, and why I've been a bit quiet on here.  Nina Jankowicz had already made a name for herself before being appointed head of Biden's Russian disinformation unit. Jankowicz, 33, is a successful author who is currently eight months pregnant with her first child. She grew up in New Jersey and is dating Michael Stein. The couple are happily shacked up in a $1 million, three-bedroom, two-and-a-half bathroom property they own in Arlington, Virginia. Jankowicz, attended Bryn Mawr College and Georgetown University, before embarking on a glittering career in foreign relations. She managed programs to Russia and Belarus at the National Democratic Institute. Jankowicz also advised the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry on disinformation and strategic communications She serves on the Board of Trustees for the Eurasia Foundation and is a global fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center But the author is best known as a prominent woke voice online.   The Biden appointee's latest book, How To Be A Woman Online has just been released, and deals with the topics of internet bullying and trolling. She has complained about hordes of men tracking down her private Facebook and Instagram accounts after she appears on TV to try to follow her and find out more about her life. Jankowicz says she prefers strangers to follow her Twitter account, and speculates that many of those who criticize her online are jealous of her 'verified' blue check mark and media career.  She has identified five different types of trolls who target her most, including 'reply guy' types who insist on trying to meddle in all aspects of her life, including in how brown she toasts her bread.  Despite claiming to be a free speech campaigner online, Jankowicz has spoken out against the First Amendment.  Aligning herself with many online progressives who've begun to call for an end to unqualified free speech, Jankowicz recently tweeted: 'I shudder to think about if free speech absolutists were taking over more platforms, what that would look like for the marginalized communities...which are already shouldering...disproportionate amounts of this abuse.' She also said the prospect of Elon Musk taking over Twitter made her 'shudder.' But Jankowicz - who has a pet dog and a cat - has not joined thousands of other liberals who've vowed to quit the platform as a result of Musk's purchase.   'Honored to be serving in the Biden Administration @DHSgov and helping shape our counter-disinformation efforts.' She added that 'a HUGE focus of our work, and indeed, one of the key reasons the Board was established, is to maintain the Dept's committment (sic) to protecting free speech, privacy, civil rights, & civil liberties.' The Russia disinformation expert previously called the laptop of President Joe Biden's son Hunter a 'Trump campaign product'. This is causing questions over Jankowicz's ability to accurately judge disinformation now that several sources have come out confirming the validity of Hunter's laptop. Jankowicz also suggested last week that she opposes the The First Amendment because she thinks it is bad for 'marginalized communities' and called Elon Musk a 'free speech absolutist' because he wants to make Twitter more open to all voices.  The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to DailyMail.com's request for comment.  Jankowicz is a fellow at the Wilson Center where she studies the 'intersection of democracy and technology in Central and Eastern Europe'. She is also the author of How To Lose the Information War: Russia, Fake News, and the Future of Conflict.  When stories about Hunter Biden's laptop started emerging, several outlets, social media sites and left-leaning disinformation experts claimed that it was just misinformation coming from Trump and others on the right. In an October 2020 report, Jankowicz shared her skepticism of the contents of the laptop and the claims it belonged to Hunter. 'We should view it as a Trump campaign product,' she told the New York Daily News at the time. Twitter repeatedly took down the Hunter Biden laptop story and prevented it from being spread on the platform. Billionaire Elon Musk, who just purchased Twitter, said that his aim is to make the social media platform a more open 'digital town square.' 'Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,' Musk wrote in a statement upon the purchase approval. Jankowicz spoke with NPR last week and questioned Musk's purchase of the platform and 'I shudder to think about if free speech absolutists were taking over more platforms, what that would look like for the marginalized communities,' she said. She said these groups are 'already shouldering...disproportionate amounts of this abuse' and said free speech and lack of censoring on social media would make it worse. Missouri Republican Senator Josh Hawley tweeted an image of her remarks to NPR with the caption: 'The Biden Administration's new anti-speech czar is apparently no fan of the  @elonmusk Twitter acquisition.' 'This is the person Joe Biden just put in charge of policing Americans' speech. Using the power of the government.' Jankowicz has advised the Ukrainian government on strategist communications - she also managed democracy assistance programs to Russia and Belarus. She received her masters in Russian, Eurasian, and East European Studies from Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, and her bachelors degree from Bryn Mawr College.",
  "0ca728b7d351c35e00bedae3f13f78a96e5f33b4b7d79779c0fbf374": "Ukraine has released a video which purports to show the grim aftermath of Russian bombardment of a military field hospital where hundreds were sheltering within in Mariupol. The images, released by the far-right Azov Brigade, are reported to be from within the Azovstal steelworks.  It is the last Ukrainian holdout in the strategic port city which has been under siege for almost two months. As many as 600 people are thought to be holed up in the hospital, many of those being treated for war wounds, plus 50 children and elderly.  Major Serhiy Volyna, commander of the 36th Brigade of the Ukrainian Army, told Sky News there had been a direct hit on the shelter of the military hospital, describing the situation as 'difficult'. This latest attack is despite Vladimir Putin calling off the offensive and ordering all routes out of the site of the Azovstal steelworks to be sealed off. Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor, said on Friday 'every day they drop several bombs on Azovstal, despite false promises not to touch the defenders', adding that 'fighting, shelling, bombing do not stop'. Defiant Ukrainian soldiers holed up in the steelworks are still refusing to surrender Mariupol despite being surrounded by Russian forces as the bodies of dead civilians continue to pile up. In the video, which has not been independently verified, a rescue worker wearing a red head light can be seen digging away at rubble with a shovel. In another shot, a survivor is holding a bottle of water with a tremendously shaking hand. In a wider shot, rescue workers attend to the survivors in a dark and smoky scene reminiscent of a natural disaster or terror attack. Azov is a far-right all-volunteer infantry military unit whose members - estimated at 900 - are ultra-nationalists and accused of harbouring neo-Nazi and white supremacist ideology.  The Azov brigade is an all-volunteer far-right military unit of the National Guard of Ukraine, based in Mariupol, holding around 900 members. Formed in May 2014, the ultra-nationalists have been fighting Russian forces since the annexation of Crimea in the same year. In 2015, a spokesman for the Azov Brigade, Andriy Diachenko, said that up to 20 per cent of the group's members are Nazis, he told USA today. Russia used the Brigade's official status with the National Guard as evidence that their invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 was to 'denazify' what they described as a nazi-leaning Ukranian government. The Azovstal steelworks, a huge and sprawling facility that makes up almost 20 per cent of Mariupol, has been home to the last remaining Ukrainians in the city. The rest of the city has been effectively razed to the ground by Russian forces. Vladimir Putin gave the word to trap the survivors inside the steelworks and starve them out if they did not surrender.  Efforts to evacuate those remaining from the city along humanitarian corridors have reportedly been blocked by the Russians. This comes after local officials said there were mass graves in the besieged city of Mariupol, containing around 9,000 bodies of Ukranian civillians.  Mariupol's mayor Vadym Boychenko accused the Russians of 'hiding their military crimes' by taking the bodies of civilians from the city and burying them in Manhush. Boychenko labelled Russian actions in the city as 'the new Babi Yar', a reference to the site of multiple Nazi massacres in which nearly 34,000 Ukrainian Jews were killed in 1941. 'The bodies of the dead were being brought by the truckload and actually simply being dumped in mounds,' adviser Andryushchenko said.",
  "189a615067357e6a56a1bc6b57a3f915f1dd40a377f5c16e3ac6a5dd": "The Florida Department of Education has reinstated nine previously nixed math textbooks that were banned because of references to Critical Race Theory and social justice issues after publishers scrubbed them of the problematic 'woke' content.      'Publishers are aligning their instructional materials to state standards and removing 'woke' content' - a statement posted to the department's website Thursday revealed. Those revisions, officials said, addressed content - such as bar graphs measuring racial prejudice and a portion titled 'What? Me? Racist?' - the state previously deemed to be 'not aligned with Florida standards, or which 'included prohibited topics and unsolicited strategies.' The nine textbooks were revised and added to the state adoption list over the past 11 days, officials said. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis had banned CRT as a component in Florida schools, claiming it promotes hatred among students and makes individuals feel guilty for racism of the past.  'It seems that some publishers attempted to slap a coat of paint on an old house built on the foundation of Common Core, and indoctrinating concepts like race essentialism, especially, bizarrely, for elementary school students,' he said of the rejected books.  'I'm grateful that Commissioner [of Education Richard] Corcoran and his team at the Department have conducted such a thorough vetting of these textbooks to ensure they comply with the law.'  Earlier this month, the state DOE garnered criticism for tossing out 41 percent of math textbooks presented for use in schools next year, without detailing the contentious content. The public outcry spurred officials to release some of the problematic pages last week - pages that were again featured in the Florida DOE's statement Thursday. Of the lessons deemed unacceptable by the state was one that used bar graphs to measure levels of racial prejudice based on age and political identity. The lesson asks students to solve equations based on the findings. The graphs, which used data from the Project Implicit Discrimination website, show attempt to illustrate that those 65 and older who lean towards conservative political beliefs have the most racial bias. Another example of banned material includes a lesson plan for polynomials, with one of the problems once again referencing the Implicit Association Test, claiming that the 2 million people who have taken the test have 'slight' or 'moderate' bias, which changes based on age and political identification.  Florida has banned 54 of the 132 math textbooks submitted to the state, a total of 41 percent.  Of the rejected books:   In Grades K-5, 71 percent of materials were rejected.  Grades 6-8 saw 20 percent of materials rejected, and in grades 9-12, 35 percent of materials were rejected.  The last two examples released by the state both mention SEL, which is banned in Florida, with one listing an SEL objective in math that states: 'Students build proficiency with social awareness as they practice with empathizing with classmates.'  The other, which was posted with a redacted line, calls for a lesson plan 'to build student agency by focusing on students' social and emotional learning, specifically the five competencies that make up the framework,' which include self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills and responsible decision-making.     The DOE said the examples provided do not represent an exhaustive list of the type of material banned and that the rejected publishers will be able to appeal the state's decision and are granted the right to alter the submitted textbooks as long as it meets that state's specifications. The department said in a statement last week that the 54 books were banned because they were not 'aligned with Florida standards or included prohibited topics and unsolicited strategies.'  'Reasons for rejecting textbooks included references to Critical Race Theory (CRT), inclusions of Common Core, and the unsolicited addition of Social Emotional Learning (SEL) in mathematics,' the department added, noting that all three learning practices are banned in the state.  'The highest number of books rejected were for grade levels K-5, where an alarming 71 percent were not appropriately aligned with Florida standards or included prohibited topics and unsolicited strategies. 'The Department is continuing to give publishers the opportunity to remediate all deficiencies identified during the review to ensure the broadest selection of high quality instructional materials are available to the school districts and Florida's students,' the DOE said after issuing the book rejections.'  By Alex Oliveira  A Tennessee state lawmaker declared that he would burn banned books if given his way during a Tennessee General Assembly session Wednesday. State Rep. Jerry Sexton, a Republican from eastern Tennessee, made the comments during a discussion about legislation he proposed that would give a commission of politicians the power to veto books out of school libraries.  Rep. John Ray Clemmons, a Democrat from Nashville, asked Sexton what he would do with the removed books. 'You going to put them in the street? Light them on fire? Where are they going?' he asked. 'I don't have a clue, but I would burn 'em,' Sexton responded on the House floor. 'That's what I thought.' Clemmons concluded.  The Republican-supermajority House approved the bill in a 66-26 vote.  Sexton's legislation and comments come after a national debate around banned books was sparked when a Tennessee school board removed the book Maus - a Pulitzer Prize winning graphic novel by Art Spiegelman, who is Jewish, that paints an unfiltered picture of the Holocaust - from its district's curriculum in January.  In Nazi Germany books by Jewish authors and books with content decreed disagreeable were publicly burned by the tens of thousands.  Earlier this year, Sexton lashed out at librarians during a legislative hearing that included testimony from some who alleged without proof that educators were attempting to 'groom' children with sexually explicit materials found in libraries. 'I don't appreciate what's going in our libraries, what's being put in front of our children and shame on you for putting it there,' Sexton said at the time.  Democratic Rep. Gloria Johnson, from Knoxville, said the legislation aimed at libraries was taking 'Tennessee in a dangerous direction.' Certain books have long faced removal from American schools for profane language, sexually explicit content, and even for mere negativity, but the past few years have seen an increase in complaints and actions against books, largely in conservative-dominated states. Conservative lawmakers have begun challenging some books on the grounds that they are being used to brainwash America's youth about race and gender. During a Wednesday event at the White House to honor teachers, President Biden weighed in on the subject.   'There are too many politicians trying to score political points trying to ban books, even math books,' he said, referring to the recent ban of a number of math textbooks in Florida, 'Did you ever think when you'd be teaching you're gonna be worried about book burnings and banning books all because it doesn't fit somebody's political agenda?' A recent report from PEN America, a non-profit dedicated to promoting free expression through literature, found that there are currently 1,586 instances of books being banned or restricted in the United States.  Those bans are in 86 school districts across 26 states. Texas has the most books banned at 713. Pennsylvania has 456, Florida has 204, Oklahoma has 43, Kansas has 30, and Tennessee has 16, according to that report. ",
  "ee757eb597383e3c66adfcdf62c0d354ab6183ce090177e31358c908": "A former Boston police union chief wept in court Monday as child rape victims tore into him after the disgraced cop admitted to raping and sexually abusing several children over the span of nearly three decades.  Ex-Police Patrolmen's Association boss Patrick Rose, 67, pleaded guilty to 21 counts of child rape and sexual assault that occurred over a 27-year period, involving victims ranging in age from 7 to 16, prosecutors said.   The former cop sat in court and cried as he listened to some of his victims deliver impact statements before he was sentenced to up to 13 years in prison.  'I saw you for what you really are -- a coward, a predator of the weak and the defenseless,' the victim said in court. Another victim said Rose has lost his reputation as a protector. 'Your reputation? Absolutely gone,' the victim said. ''All you will ever be remembered as is another creep who has nothing going for him. Your job as a cop protecting people? [Well] that's really quite ironic isn't it?'  Rose had first faced child sexual abuse allegations in the mid-1990s, but criminal charges were dropped.  However, Rose was allowed to remain on the force for years despite sufficient evidence found by internal investigators supporting allegations that he sexually assaulted a minor, according to documents released by the city last year. Rose had been relieved of his weapon and placed on administrative duty, but was returned to full duty after an attorney for the Boston Police Patrolmen's Association wrote to the commissioner in 1997 and threatened to file a grievance, according to the documents, obtained by NBC Boston.  He was then elected president of the Boston Police Patrolman's Association in 2014 and served until he retired in 2018. Rose was charged in August 2020 with sexually abusing a 7-year-old female relative, who, now a teenager, had told police the abuse continued for five years until she turned 12.  The victim told police that Rose allegedly touched her inappropriately and asked her to perform sexual acts on him in his West Roxbury home. Several more people then came forward alleging they were abused by Rose.  He was ultimately charged with 33 counts of sexual abuse of six children.  On Monday, Rose pleaded guilty to the multitude of sexual abuse crimes spanning nearly three decades.   Rose had previously denied the charges but reached a plea deal with prosecutors. Documents released last year of a 1996 internal police department probe showed that top officials concluded Rose likely sexually abused a child yet he continued to patrol in Dorchester and interact with children and sex-abuse victims, masslive.com reported.  Then-Police Commissioner Paul Evans and internal investigations chief Ann Marie Doherty released a joint statement in April 2021 defending their actions, saying that they were unable to discipline Rose because they did not have a witness or other evidence, the Globe reported.  'We believed at the time, and we still believe, that everything that could be done by the Boston Police Department was done in this matter to hold Rose accountable,' the statement read. On Monday, Suffolk District Attorney Kevin Hayden praised the courage of the victims and said he hoped the plea brings a measure of healing. 'Anyone who was in that courtroom today knows the tremendous courage, fortitude and bravery that they withstood throughout this entire horrible incident. These are monstrous, monstrous acts,' he said outside of court. Following the impact statements, Rose expressed remorse in a statement he read in court. 'I want to apologize for my despicable behavior,' he said. 'I apologize to my former colleagues. I apologize to my former friends, but more importantly, the more important thing in my life, I apologize to my family. To those I hurt, I'm so very sorry.'",
  "a02751887da32fa87cb36e88f6fa8fb165b1748a9b2dd248acead2a1": "Sir Keir Starmer was last night accused of hypocrisy for attending a birthday cake celebration in his office during the pandemic. The Labour leader tucked into the shop-bought chocolate and lemon cakes while coronavirus guidance advised against holding close social gatherings indoors. Sir Keir has repeatedly demanded Boris Johnson quit for attending an impromptu birthday gathering in the Cabinet Room in June 2020 - just three months before his own celebration. The PM and Chancellor were hit with fines for breaking lockdown laws that banned indoor gatherings at that time. However, it has now emerged that Sir Keir was given a birthday card and two cakes in his office on his birthday in September 2020. While Covid laws on gatherings had been relaxed a month earlier, government guidance at the time stated that people should not 'hold or attend celebrations (such as parties) where it is difficult to maintain social distancing and avoid close social interaction'. The Government also said people should not 'socialise indoors in groups of more than two households'. It was not clear last night how many others helped Sir Keir to eat the cakes in his office.  A Tory source said: 'It now seems that, as well as sinking a few cold ones with mates at his infamous Durham drinks party, Sir Keir flouted the guidance in place for a little birthday bash... that is of course unless you believe that he popped out to a shop, bought himself a cake and sat alone eating it in his office. 'We know that Labour have lied about these things in the past so it makes you wonder what else they're hiding. The stench of hypocrisy gets stronger by the day.' Sir Keir claimed the Prime Minister and Chancellor 'dishonoured their office' by attending the impromptu birthday celebration on June 19, 2020, the day Mr Johnson turned 56. Rishi Sunak was in attendance because he had been invited to a crucial meeting about Covid. Mr Johnson was eating a salad. It was initially believed that the PM had been presented with a Union Jack cake while aides sang 'Happy Birthday' to him.  However, it has since emerged that the cake - bought by a special adviser - never even left its Tupperware box. Some sausage rolls from Marks and Spencer were laid out on the Cabinet table along with a few cans of Estrella lager, but it is believed that these too were left untouched.  Nevertheless, Sir Keir claimed Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak's attendance had 'dishonoured' the sacrifices made by people during lockdown - as well as their offices.  After the men were fined, Sir Keir said: 'This is the first time in the history of our country that a Prime Minister has been found to be in breach of the law, and then he lied repeatedly to the public about it. Britain deserves better, they [the PM and the Chancellor] have to go.'  Labour did not respond to a request for comment last night. However, a party source said no laws were broken. 'This is the first time in the history of our country that a Prime Minister has been found to be in breach of the law, and then he lied repeatedly to the public about it. Britain deserves better, they have to go.' Sir Keir Starmer, April 12 'Now we know the Prime Minister did not shut down his own birthday party... he spent it breaking the law. We have a Prime Minister who is sorry only that he has been found out.' Angela Rayner, April 21 'We are all concerned by the situation in Ukraine, but that should not be used as a smokescreen for the failings of this Prime Minister.' MP Matt Western, April 21  ",
  "49cdd53006ca817ceee761aa46c9547ce7da3234c7a2f4265227818f": "Angela Rayner last night risked accusations of a cover-up over the sexism row that has convulsed Westminster. Labour's deputy leader had described a story in last week's Mail on Sunday - which said she had joked with Tory MPs about crossing and uncrossing her legs to distract Boris Johnson - as 'disgusting' and 'completely untrue'. Amid a storm of criticism on social media, Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle demanded a meeting with the newspaper's editor David Dillon. Mr Dillon rejected the call, saying that journalists should 'not take instruction' from parliamentary officials. Yesterday The Daily Telegraph reported that two Conservative MPs had told the newspaper they had heard Mrs Rayner laughing publicly about the idea that she could put off the Prime Minister by 'giving him a flash'. The witnesses said she had been joking about the suggestion that she was crossing and uncrossing her legs during a light-hearted discussion on the Commons terrace about two months ago. Separately, The Mail On Sunday has now spoken to a total of four Tory MPs - the original source and three others, including one woman - all of whom supported this account and contradicted the insinuation by Mrs Rayner and her allies that the claims were cooked up by sexists. One of the MPs, describing a night on the Commons terrace earlier this year, said Mrs Rayner had initiated the discussion of the issue. They said she had spoken of giving the Prime Minister 'a flash'. A second MP claimed that Mrs Rayner had referenced the thriller Basic Instinct, in which Sharon Stone's character infamously uncrosses her legs while being interrogated by police. 'Angela told us: 'I like to do my Sharon Stone trick to distract Boris... I cross and uncross my legs',' the witness said. A third MP added that they also remembered the encounter. The original source for the Mail on Sunday story said that the 'Sharon Stone' joke had been made while Mrs Rayner spoke to a Tory MP. 'She was telling him how she distracts Boris,' they said. All four Tories gave almost identical accounts of her remarks. They each said Mrs Rayner had used a startling slang colloquialism during the discussion. When The Mail on Sunday approached Mrs Rayner last Saturday about the exchanges on the terrace, a Labour spokesman said: 'It's completely made up, so unless they're going to say something properly on the record or have any evidence I would expect that this made-up story wouldn't run. 'I'm telling you categorically it's untrue so I'm afraid you know that doesn't meet the bar, an unnamed source without any evidence... I'm telling you, it's categorically untrue that this has happened.' After Mrs Rayner strenuously denied making the remarks, coverage of the story initially concentrated on allegations of sexism. The row then saw Sir Lindsay attempt to summon The Mail on Sunday's editor for a meeting. However, on Wednesday the Daily Mail revealed that Mrs Rayner had in fact publicly joked about the Basic Instinct comparison herself in January. Speaking to Matt Forde for his Political Party podcast, she volunteered the fact that her appearances in the Commons had prompted online references to the 1992 movie thriller. 'Every time I do a Prime Minister's Questions somebody has an opinion on what I wear. Did you see the meme about Sharon Stone like I was doing it at PMQs? I was mortified,' she said, laughing. 'I wasn't aware I did it but apparently there was this whole meme about how my dress was a bit revealing. I didn't think it was. It was a perfectly suitable Karen Millen - in the sale by the way.' The podcast also saw her use the same slang colloquialism MPs say she used on the Commons terrace. Meanwhile, as the backlash grew over Sir Lindsay's intervention, Mr Dillon formally turned down the Speaker's request for a meeting, saying that Britain's free Press would not endure if journalists had to take instructions from officials in the House of Commons. He also said other MPs had come forward to corroborate the original account of Mrs Rayner's remarks. The Prime Minister later backed Mr Dillon's decision. A No 10 spokesman said Mr Johnson would not want 'any perception of politicians seeking to in any way curb or control what a free Press seeks to report'. A spokesman for Mrs Rayner last night declined to comment further on the story.",
  "95a54125d199ed04fd87bcb5f9df976691b9eee6b49261d45489dd14": "The well-respected parents of a woman who suffered from Locked-in Syndrome and was found dead fused to a living room couch, covered in insects and her own bodily fluids are facing second-degree murder charges.  Shelia, 64, and Clay Fletcher, 65, will face a grand jury Monday after their 36-year-old daughter Lacey Ellen was found partially naked, sitting upright and submerged in a hole in a couch covered from head to toe in urine, liquid feces and insect bites, with live bugs and rodent excrement nearby at their otherwise tidy home in Slaughter, Louisiana, East Feliciana Parish Coroner Dr. Ewell Dewitt Bickham III told DailyMail.com on Thursday.  'The scene was sickening. I've seen some horrible things in my life but nothing like this,' said Bickham, a medical worker since the 1970s, adding that she had bed sores that went all the way down to her bone. Lacey suffered from Locked-in Syndrome, a rare neurological disorder characterized by complete paralysis of voluntary muscles, except for those that control the eyes. Police arrived at the ranch-style home in the suburb north of Baton Rouge on January 3 to find the ghastly scene after the parents called 911 because Lacey wasn't breathing, prosecutors said. The parents were supposed to be the girl's care providers, but Bickham said she had not been to a physician in 20 years.  'It's unconscionable, something you make horror movies about,' he said.  WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGE    When he arrived at the home, he described the stench being so bad that, 'it would almost run you out of the house.'  He told DailyMail.com that he knew it was a 'potential crime scene,' and immediately called his detective. 'The parents were in the kitchen. They did not have an explanation,' he said. He ruled her death a homicide and cause of death as medical neglect. He recorded the official time of death as 3:07 am on January 3, 2022 but said he believes she was deceased at least 24-48 hours prior.  Sheila Fletcher has worked as a police and court clerk in Baker and more recently as an assistant to the city prosecutor in Zachary, report said. According to her LinkedIn page, Sheila was a Slaughter official who  resigned her post on the town's Board of Aldermen on January 24, three weeks after her daughter's death. She served for four years, most recently as mayor pro team. State business filings show Clay Fletcher is an officer of the nonprofit Baton Rouge Civil War Roundtable, which has a mission 'to educate and foster an appreciation for the sacrifices made by all during the Civil War.'      The couple's lawyer, Steven Moore, was unavailable for comment on Thursday when DailyMail.com contacted him.  However, on Wednesday, Moore issued a statement on his client's behalf, BPProud reported. 'They don't want to relive the pain of losing a child through the media. They have been through a lot of heartache over the years. Anyone who had lost a child knows what it's like,' Moore said.  On Monday, Bickham will  present the case to a grand jury, in the hopes of charging the parents in the death of their daughter. 'I probably won't even have to open my mouth the pictures will show it,' Bickham said. He added: 'The jurors are storekeepers, farmers many have never been exposed to this stuff so I asked that a medical team be outside the courtroom.' District Attorney Sam D'Aquilla told the Dailymail.com that the parents were never  taken into custody because they're not considered flight risks. A 12-person jury will be in a closed session at the court house in Clinton, where they will decide on charges of manslaughter, negligent homicide or second-degree murder, he said. 'Negligent homicide is zero to five years; manslaughter is zero to 40 years and second-degree is life in prison. I will ask for second-degree because they didn't do what they were supposed to do,' he said.     D'Aquilla confirmed to DailyMail.com that Lacey's parents were her primary caretakers, and that she did not have an aide. 'We don't treat animals or neglect our animals in that way. If you have an animal in that condition you take them to the vet,' he said.   D'Aquilla told the DailyMail.com that Lacey had some issues that she went to see a psychiatrist for back in 1999 or early 2000s and that she had been anti-social.  He said that in 2011-2012, her parents claimed that she did not want to leave the house and had not been to a doctor. He said that Lacey's parents claimed that she was able to communicate with them and that she apparently never complained.   'If you are not capable of providing the care than get help,' he said. 'We want people to know that if you are a caregiver of someone you need to pay attention is it important for neighbors and the community to look out for each other. We hope this never happens again.'   According to a 2020 U.S. census, 882 people live in Slaughter, a town in East Feliciana Parish. Many of the homes are spread out over acres, so when news of Lacey's death broke many in the community were stunned with some having no idea that Clay and Shelia Fletcher even had a daughter.  'They are appalled,' said the coroner who spoke to some of the neighbors. 'Some of these people were churchgoing friends who had no idea that there was another person in that house.    Locked-in syndrome (LIS), also known as pseudocoma, is a rare neurological disorder characterized by complete paralysis of voluntary muscles, except for those that control the eyes. People with LIS are conscious and can think and reason, but they are unable to speak or move. The only way they can communicate is through blinking and vertical eye movements. Some of the causes of this disorder may stem from a traumatic brain injury, brain stem stroke, tumors, diseases of the circulatory system (bleeding), diseases that destroy the myelin sheath surrounding nerve cells (like multiple sclerosis), infection, or medication overdose.  There is no cure or specific treatments for locked-in syndrome, according to GARD, Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center. The organization recommends supportive therapy for breathing and feeding, particularly early on. Additional treatment include: physical therapy, comfort care, nutritional support, and prevention of complications from respiratory infections. A person with LIS may have partial muscle control, in some cases. Speech therapists can help people with locked-in syndrome communicate more clearly with eye movements and blinking.  Electronic communication devices, including patient-computer interfaces such as infrared eye movement sensors and computer voice prosthetics, enables people to communicate more freely and have access to the internet. Motorized wheelchairs have also increased their independence.  Those with locked-in syndrome do not live beyond the early stage due to medical complications, GARD said.. However, others may live for another 10-20 years and report a good quality of life despite the severe disabilities caused by the syndrome. ",
  "468d60e120fd79211a6d80434e477f7bea940a6d94326ce046ea6ca6": "Twitter's top lawyer Vijaya Gadde is in the spotlight after Elon Musk criticized her in a string of scathing tweets, leading a former company executive to accuse the billionaire of 'bullying' and spearheading a harassment campaign. Gadde, 47, has been a low-key Silicon Valley power player for years, and at Twitter played a key role in the contentious decisions to ban Donald Trump and suppress news articles about Hunter Biden's laptop.  After moving to the US from India with her family as a toddler, Gadde and her family faced racism as she grew up in Beaumont, Texas, where she has said her father had to seek approval from the Ku Klux Klan to sell insurance door-to-door.  Now the mother of a young child, Gadde has built a remarkable career, spending a decade at elite Silicon Valley law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati and working in the legal department at Juniper Networks before joining Twitter in 2011. Federal records show that she has also donated regularly to Democratic candidates, contributing more than $18,000 over the past two decades, and most recently supporting Kamala Harris with a $2,700 check in 2019. A Twitter spokesperson did not immediately respond to an inquiry from DailyMail.com on Thursday afternoon seeking comment from Gadde or the company.  As Twitter's chief legal officer and general counsel, Gadde exercises enormous power at the company, where she has long essentially had final say over who is allowed on the platform, and what they can tweet. In an interview with Bloomberg, Gadde once said that Twitter's former CEO Jack Dorsey left the creation and enforcement of content policies up to her.   'He rarely weighs in on an individual enforcement decision,' Gadde told the outlet. 'I can't even think of a time. I usually go to him and say, 'this is what's going to happen.'' Although she maintains a low profile, that power has put Gadde at the center of some of Twitter's most controversial moderation decisions, including the decision to permanently ban Trump after his supporters stormed the US Capitol in January 2021. She also signed off on Twitter's move to block the sharing of links to a New York Post article based on files from Hunter Biden's abandoned laptop soon before the 2020 election.  The Post's Twitter account was also suspended for roughly two weeks. Later reporting, including from DailyMail.com, confirmed the laptop's authenticity. Gadde hit the headlines again this week after she reportedly broke down in tears while briefing her 350 employees on Musk's successful $44 billion bid to acquire Twitter.  When political podcast host Saagar Enjeti tweeted that Gadde was instrumental in the decision to temporarily suspend the New York Post's account, Musk replied: 'Suspending the Twitter account of a major news organization for publishing a truthful story was obviously incredibly inappropriate.' On Wednesday he doubled down on the criticism of Gadde, sharing a meme with his 86 million followers showing Gadde and suggesting the company's decisions are affected by a 'left wing bias.' But Musk's tweets drew furious backlash from Dick Costolo, who was the CEO of Twitter between 2010 and 2015. Costolo replied to Musk: 'What's going on? You're making an executive at the company you just bought the target of harassment and threats.'  In a subsequent tweet, the former Twitter boss wrote: 'Bullying is not leadership.' Musk hit back: 'What are talking about? I'm just saying Twitter needs to be politically neutral.' He appeared to elaborate more on this point by tweeting: 'For Twitter to deserve public trust, it must be politically neutral, which effectively means upsetting the far right and the far left equally'. Current Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal also appeared to respond obliquely to the controversy, tweeting he was proud of 'our people' who managed to stay focused despite the 'noise'. 'I took this job to change Twitter for the better, course correct where we need to, and strengthen the service,' he said. 'Proud of our people who continue to do the work with focus and urgency despite the noise.' Though she is now in the spotlight, Gadde has long appeared keen to maintain a low profile. She was described in a 2020 Politico profile as 'the most important Silicon Valley executive you've never heard of.' Managing a team of 350, in 2021 she earned $17 million: a base salary of $600,000, plus a bonus of $450,000 and almost $400,000 in personal security. The rest was from shares.  Born in India and moving to Beaumont, Texas, when she was two years old, she recalls her engineer father having to go to the KKK to ask permission to sell insurance door-to-door. She later said that the unjust situation was what inspired her to become a lawyer.  The family later moved to New Jersey, and Gadde graduated with a law degree from New York University in 2000.  'I felt very strongly that I needed to be in a position where I understood my rights, or my community's rights,' she told Politico. 'I didn't ever want to be taken advantage of.' Though Gadde was previously married to fellow attorney Ramsey Homsany, the couple filed for divorce in 2014 in what appears to be an amicable split without any children, court records show.  It's unclear whether she later remarried, but Gadde does have a young child who was born around 2017.   Gadde joined Silicon Valley law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, where she worked for a decade before becoming Senior Director in the legal department of Juniper Networks in Silicon Valley.  She joined Twitter in 2011, and became co-founder and then-CEO Jack Dorsey's right-hand woman, sitting next to him and accompanying him on his meetings in Congress and at the White House. In October 2019 she was the architect of the idea to stop political advertising on the platform, and shortly before the election she played a key role in the decision to suspend The New York Post's account when it reported on Hunter Biden's laptop. Twitter claimed it violated the company policy against promoting hacked material; critics were angered by the heavy-handedness, and Twitter later apologized. In January 2021, it was Gadde who rang Dorsey - on vacation in Hawaii - to inform him they were banning Donald Trump, for violating policies against inciting violence.   Gadde is also a co-founder of #Angels, an investment collective that backs start-ups and helps ensure that women receive equal compensation at successful companies. She is also on the board of medical charity Mercy Corps.",
  "118d7a81bc43751df17353bc71bb23d9e6da7479b50b9bc2d8b588b4": "Disgraced Merrill Lynch financier James Iannazzo, who was arrested after hurling a smoothie at a Robeks worker and branding her a 'f**king immigrant loser,' has avoided a criminal conviction after being accepted into a one-year rehabilitation program. Iannazzo will be supervised by the Connecticut Office of Adult Probation for 12-months, and if he completes it all charges against him - including intimidation based on bias, breach of peace and criminal trespass - will be dropped. The probation program is offered to defendants without previous convictions and who are deemed unlikely to re-offend. Iannazzo said he was planning to apply to the program during a March 9 court appearance. He has also been ordered to donate $500 to the Office of Victim Services. The financier triggered public outcry after a TikTok showing him going on a racist rant and hurling a smoothie at teenage employees at a Robeks smoothie store in Connecticut went viral in January.  He was caught on camera roaring: 'I want to speak to the person who made this f**king drink. Is that you? 'You don't know who made it? Stupid f**king ignorant high school kids. I want to speak to the f**king manager. Get the f**k out of here you f**king bitch. Give it to me now.' At that point, he hurled the drink, which hit an employee and spilled all over her, before staff told him to leave while calling the police. Iannazzo continued: ' 'F**k you, you f**king bitch. I want the telephone, right now. Shut the f**k up, you f**king stupid (inaudible). I want the f**king phone. Shut up. 'You f**king immigrant loser. I want the f**king telephone.'   Iannazo claimed he lost his temper and 'his paternal instinct kicked in' after staff prepared a smoothie containing peanut butter, which caused his 17-year-old son to go into anaphylactic shock. He claimed he had warned staff that his son was allergic to nuts, while staff claimed that he requested there be no peanut butter but failed to mention an allergy.   'I was out of my mind with fear for him when I returned to Robeks, and I wish I had not done so,' Iannazzo said afterwards. 'I also wish they had been more careful preparing my son's beverage. I will be extending my apologies personally to the Robeks organization, particularly the staff that was working there that night.' Iannazo was fired from his job at Merrill Lynch - where he had worked since 1995, most recently as a vice president of wealth management - after the clip was widely-shared online. 'Our company does not tolerate behavior of this kind. We immediately investigated and have taken action. This individual is no longer employed at our firm,' the company said in a statement after the video became viral.  After the incident Iannazzo was arrested on charges of intimidation based on bias, breach of peace and criminal trespass before being released. 'It was kind of scary, I'm not going to lie because I'm like 'I don't know his intention or what he was going to do,' 18-year-old Gianna Miranda, who works part-time at the Robeks told local news station WFSB. 'He started to call her racial slurs. He threatened to kill us multiple times,' Hill, who is 17 according to the social media platform, also told the outlet. 'I understand and we are sorry on behalf of Robeks for how the smoothie was made, but it gives you absolutely no right to act out like that.'",
  "31ce61268b6be694bcf79032741d52df17e26762287e780e43041acd": "Amazon delivered a disappointing quarter and outlook on Thursday as the ecommerce giant was swamped by higher costs and online shopping declined in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Shares of the company fell 10 percent in extended trading after the company reported its first net loss since 2015, a $3.8 billion hit due in part to its investment in Rivian Automotive. After a long-running surge in sales during the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, Amazon's outlook has dimmed as life returns to normal. The company's expenses swelled as it offered higher pay to attract workers during a labor shortage, and even then it could not fully staff warehouses.  A fulfillment center in New York City voted to create Amazon's first U.S. union, a result the retailer is contesting.  And higher fuel prices are eating into consumers' disposable income while making delivery more expensive for Amazon. The Seattle-based company parried by raising fees. Partway through the just-ended first quarter, Amazon hiked the price of its fast-shipping club Prime, which has garnered more than 200 million subscribers, by 17 percent to $139 annually in the United States.  Effective Thursday, it is imposing an average 5 percent fuel and inflation surcharge on merchants that use Amazon's U.S. warehousing services as well. Amazon's forecast shows these actions may not be enough to counter such challenges.  The company expects to lose as much as $1 billion in operating income this quarter, or make as much as $3 billion. That's down from an operating profit of $7.7 billion in the same period last year. 'The pandemic and subsequent war in Ukraine have brought unusual growth and challenges,' said Amazon CEO Andy Jassy in a statement.  Jassy said the company has finally met its warehouse staffing and capacity needs, but it still has work to do in improving productivity.  'This may take some time, particularly as we work through ongoing inflationary and supply chain pressures, but we see encouraging progress on a number of customer experience dimensions, including delivery speed performance as we're now approaching levels not seen since the months immediately preceding the pandemic in early 2020,' he said.  The division that Jassy ran before becoming CEO last year, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has traditionally been a bright spot for the company. The unit increased revenue 37 percent to $18.4 billion, slightly ahead of analysts' estimates. In retail, the e-commerce giant has had mixed results turning to brick-and-mortar stores to power food delivery and meet consumers wherever they wished to shop.  Amazon said in March it planned to close all 68 of its bookstores, pop-ups and other home goods shops, as it focuses on grocery stores.  It recently automated two Whole Foods Market locations to make them cashierless. The company's physical store sales grew 17 percent to $4.6 billion. Still, Amazon's outlook reflects broader industry challenges. U.S. government data shows that online retail sales fell 6.4 percent in March after declining 3.5 percent the month prior, the first back-to-back drop since the last two months of 2020.  Some economists attributed the change to household budgets strained from higher gasoline prices, while others blamed shifting seasonal patterns.  Just this week, a major Amazon delivery partner, United Parcel Service Inc, said it expected e-commerce delivery growth to slow. Amazon projected net sales of between $116 billion and $121 billion for the second quarter. Analysts were expecting $125.48 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Net sales was $116.4 billion in the first quarter, compared to analysts' expectations of $116.3 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Net loss was $3.8 billion, or $7.56 per share, compared with a profit of $8.1 billion, or $15.79 per share, a year earlier.",

The New York Times has been releasing audio clips from a January 10, 2021 call where McCarthy, speaking to House leadership, floats asking Trump to resign during the aftermath of the January 6 Capitol attack.  McCarthy, his No. 2 House Minority Whip Steve Scalise and his then No. 3 former House Republican Conference Chair Rep. Liz Cheney, also discussed a number of inflammatory statements made by their own GOP members.  Kristol's group supports 'principled Republicans,' which in their view is only defined by members of the GOP who didn't contest the 2020 election during the January 6 vote, which was interrupted by the Capitol attack.  More recently, Kristol has gone as far as to endorse Democrats, including Democratic Virginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe, to expunge Trump's influence from the party, despite GOP candidate Glenn Youngkin not necessarily espousing pro-MAGA beliefs.  Youngkin won the November race.   McCarthy remains with the majority of his party.  On Wednesday morning McCarthy reportedly smoothed things over and was given a standing ovation by fellow House Republicans after he defended his comments from the tapes.   'He's widely supported. Will be speaker,' one source in the room told The Washington Post.  CNN's Melanie Zanona reported that McCarthy told colleagues that he was just floating scenarios when he told Republican leadership during a January 10 call that former President Donald Trump should resign.  McCarthy and his allies were also caught complaining about the rhetoric used by fellow GOP lawmakers including Reps. Matt Gaetz, Mo Brooks, Lauren Boebert and Barry Moore during a private phone call in the days following the January 6 Capitol attack.  On Tuesday, The New York Times released fresh audio clips of McCarthy on the call with Scalise, then-House Republican Conference Chair Cheney, Rep. Tim Emmer and a handful of Congressional aides, where he relayed his fears that remarks by a vocal fringe minority could lead to violence.  'Tension is too high, the country is too crazy,' McCarthy warned on the January 10 call. 'I do not want to look back and think we caused something or we missed something and someone got hurt. I don't want to play politics with any of that.'  The Washington Post also reported that Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who was also briefly brought up on the call, said at the meeting Wednesday morning that Scalise needed to apologize for his remarks.   In one clip from the call, McCarthy is heard discussing comments Gaetz made on Newsmax, where he went after fellow Republicans for being 'anti-Trump.' One of the Republicans Gaetz was critical of was Cheney, who blasted the outgoing president after the January 6 insurrection.   'This is serious stuff people are doing that has to stop,' the top House Republican grumbled, mentioning briefings he was receiving from the FBI. 'I'm calling Gaetz, I'm explaining to him, I don't know if I have much to say, but I'm going to have some other people call him too,' McCarthy continued. 'This is serious s**t, to cut this out.'  Scalise pushed that 'it's potentially illegal what he's doing.'  'Well, he's putting people in jeopardy,' McCarthy said. 'And he doesn't need to be doing this. We saw what people would do in the Capitol, you know, and these people came prepared with rope, with everything else.'  Scalise also pointed to comments made by Brooks and Rep. Louie Gohmert, including how Brooks said at the 'Save America' rally before the Capitol Attack that 'today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.'  'You got the Maxine Waters and all that stuff too, I know the Dems are in a very strong positions to drive a lot of things, but our members have got to start paying attention to what they say too, we can't put up with that type of s**t,' McCarthy said.  In the past, Republicans have gone after Waters, a California Democrat, for some of her rhetoric.   'You think the president deserves to be impeached for his comments? That's almost something that goes further than what the president said,' McCarthy said of Brooks' 'kicking ass' line.  On the call, Cheney brought up Boebert, pointing out that she had tweeted members' movements during the January 6 attack.  McCarthy asked if Greene - often linked to Boebert over their shared, now disavowed, interest in QAnon - had been a speaker at former President Donald Trump's 'Save America' rally.  McCarthy is also told about tweets made from Moore.  'Wow, we have more arrests for stealing a podium on January 6 than we do for stealing an election on November 3, Atlanta, Philadelphia and Detroit would be places I'd reccomend you start,' Moore wrote before deleting his personal Twitter account.  On the death of capitol rioter Ashli Babbitt he commented, 'I understand it was a black police officer who shot the white female veteran.' 'You know that doesn't fit the narrative,' the Alabama Republican tweeted.  After Moore's tweets were read aloud on the call, both McCarthy and Cheney are heard murmuring, 'wow.'   'Can't they take their Twitter accounts away, too?' McCarthy then said.  The sound bites released Tuesday were from the same call in which McCarthy told GOP leadership he'd tell Trump to resign - comments he continues to deny, despite the recording being released publicly.  The January 10 call was revealed by New York Times reporters Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns, in a preview of their new book, This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden and the Battle for America's Future. The comments prompted January 6 House select committee Chairman Bennie Thompson to announce Tuesday that the panel would issue 'another invitation' to McCarthy to testify.  Then the Democrat-led committee - which includes Republicans Cheney and Rep. Adam Kinzinger - will decide whether to subpoena McCarthy and other Republicans, Punchbowl News said.  ",

A trail cam captured the cute moment the wild animal took a late-night bath in a pond south of Lake Tahoe April 25. Toogee Sielsch, whose @tahoetoogee Instagram account includes hidden cam footage of the lake's animal population in the woods, shared the video on social media, along with the caption: 'You think you love bath time? Think again.' 'From a young age I've been more of a shower guy, but hey, I admire this South Lake Tahoe black bear's bath time zeal!,' Sielsch added. The gigantic bear can be seen in the black-and-white footage fully immersing itself around 10 p.m. in the water. The video shows the bear turning on its back, and rocking back and forth in the water. It eventually gets back on its four paws, shaking its fur to dry off.  The California Department of Fish and Wildlife issued a warning to Lake Tahoe residents over potential increased bear sightings as the animals come out from hibernation in time for the start of spring. There are roughly 15,000 bears in the Lake Tahoe basin area.  The warnings come after a gigantic Lake Tahoe bear, nicknamed Hank the Tank, shot to fame in February when he was caught on camera rifling for scraps. Hank, who weighs about 500 pounds, wandered around Lake Tahoe homes in search of a meal bigger than his appetite. The bear has been spotted in the neighborhood more than 100 times since July and nothing - loud noises, paintballs, or Tasers - can scare him off. Local residents have described Hank as 'gentle' and said he just eats and leaves without causing any real trouble. But wildlife officials said locals who leave out unsecured food for Hank are making him too bold, California wildlife authorities faced numerous complaints from residents in the resort town as the bear has prompted more than 150 calls to law enforcement and wildlife personnel in the area this year. 'This one individual bear has been linked to property damage at 38 different properties at least,' California Department of Fish and Wildlife spokesman Peter Tira told KCRA 3 in Sacramento on February 17. Authorities added that the curvy cub caused 'extensive property damage and forcefully entered several homes - including occupied homes.' Typically around late November, early December, bears go into torpor, which is a state of physical or mental inactivity, according to the BEAR League, a non-profit organization in the area. For the black bear species, hibernation tends to be more of a response to a shortage of food, decreasing temperatures and snow on the ground.  It can last a few weeks in warmer parts of North America in the Northeast and West Coast, to six months for bears in Alaska.  Experts also said it's best not to wake up a hibernating bear. A bear that can sense danger quickly wakes up. California is home to around 25,000 to 35,000 black bears, according to the USDA Forest Service. Oregon is home to 25,000 to 30,000 and is known as 'Black Bear Country,'  The Parks Department added that bear attacks are 'uncommon' and the animals typically 'avoid human contact,' but reminds the public that it is 'never safe to approach a bear.'",
  "6b825e96eff166f092cc8b2d008ac1e872fddfc8f72fb8047c79eb85": "A bodycam captured the dramatic moment a man and a woman were rescued by sheriff's deputies after being stranded with a single life jacket in Florida.  Around 7:40 pm Monday, the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office's Marine Unit saved two stranded boaters - a man and a woman - who are seen in footage floating aimlessly holding onto a single lifejacket. The HCSO Marine Unit said it was conducting maritime patrols when officials saw a disabled boat with one person on board and two adults in distress nearly 200 yards away from the boat.  Footage of the rescue shows two deputies pull up to the stranded boaters and pull them onto the boat, with one of the deputies telling his partner to help the woman first.  Scroll Down For Video:  The stranded male boater tells the officers: 'Appreciate you,' as they help the woman out of the water.   'It's going to be hard to get up here,' they tell her, but then are able to get her on board.  At that point, the stranded man asks: 'Can I go around the back or...?' motioning to the back of the boat. Officers tell him to remain where he is while the woman is guided to sit on a cooler.  The deputies pull the man on board with a bit more effort. Clearly relieved, he jokes with the deputies, saying they have a 'bad ass boat'. One replies, 'thank you' and then one of the deputies appears to be talking on a radio.   The boaters later were taken back to their boat, which they were able to start up again, and they returned to the marina. Sheriff Chad Chronister expressed gratitude for the Marine Unit that was on patrol.    'Had they not been patrolling the waters, this could have ended very differently,' Chronister said in a statement.  He asked other boaters to use this rescue as a warning. 'Summer is just around the corner,' Chronister added. 'I want to remind all boaters to ensure their vessels are in good condition, and to please, always wear a life jacket. These simple steps could be the difference between a beautiful day out on the water or a tragedy.'",
  "828947163253bc597bbbe2427695b6e3fb64621800b12af34c877937": "Republicans hit back at President Joe Biden on Thursday, a day after he fired a salvo in the education wars by saying parents gave up control of their children at the classroom door. Schools are at the center of one of the fiercest debates in national politics and Biden used a reception for teachers at the White House to say parents 'don't belong to them 'when they're in the classroom.  Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt led the backlash.  'God gave kids to parents - NOT the government,' he tweeted. Other conservatives expressed their anger in ever more graphic terms. 'No they're not your children,' tweeted Sebastian Gorka, former Trump administration official and radio host, 'you senile communist clown.' Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said he had no right to talk about children and schools at all. 'Biden wants Americans to forget about the months he spent perpetuating COVID theater as he stood in lockstep with unions to keep teachers and students out of the classroom and force masks on kids and toddlers,' she said. 'Biden has done irreparable damage to our children and has failed students, teachers, and parents.' On Wednesday the president addressed educators at the 2022 Teacher of the Year ceremony hosted by the White House. 'They're all our children,' he said. 'They are not somebody's else children. They're like yours when they're in the classroom.' Biden also took aim at parents and Republican legislators who have spearheaded efforts to ban books and bar sexually explicit or overly politically correct curriculum.  'Today, there are too many politicians trying to score political points banning books, even math books,' the president said. 'Did you ever think when you'd be teaching you're going to be worried about book burnings and banning books all because it doesn't fit somebody's political agenda?' He added, speaking of teachers: 'We have got to stop making them the target of the culture wars.'  Biden's comments echoed the now-infamous declaration from former Virginia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe who, while on the campaign trail last year, blasted the role parents were playing in his state's education system.  'I'm not going to let parents come into schools and actually take books out and make their own decisions,' he said during a September debate. 'I don't think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.' McAuliffe's opponent, now-Governor Glenn Youngkin, hit back, saying: 'You believe school systems should tell children what to do. I believe parents should be in charge of their kids' education.' Youngkin, who swept to victory in Virginia, had made parental rights in education a staple of his gubernatorial campaign, with his surprise victory largely-credited to his laser focus on Democrats' woke education policies. Unlike Biden, who seemingly seeks less parent involvement in schools, the GOP is leaning on parental education rights as a wedge ahead of the midterm elections, hoping to mobilize Republicans and appeal to independent voters.  HB 1557 was introduced by two Republican members of the Florida Legislature - Representative Joe Harding and Senator Dennis Baxley. They say the bill's aim is to 'empower parents' in their children's education, and make teachers recognize the distinction between 'instruction' and 'discussion.' 'What we're prohibiting is instructing them in a specific direction,' Baxley said about how teachers lead students in a classroom.  'Students can talk about whatever they want to bring up, but sometimes the right answer is, ''You really ought to talk to your parents about that.''' The bill applies to children in kindergarten through third grade. It states that 'classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur.' It also requires districts to 'adopt procedures for notifying a student's parent if there is a change in the student's services or monitoring related to the student's mental, emotional, or physical health or well-being,' something LGBTQ advocates argue could lead to students being outed to their parents without the student's knowledge or consent. It was passed on March 8 in a 22-17 vote. The state House had approved the bill late last month. DeSantis signed it into law on March 28 and it will come into effect on July 1. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has made education a priority in his state, passing numerous bills that spew the parental-choice rhetoric. In March, Florida passed the controversial Parental Rights in Education Bill (HB 1557) - dubbed by critics as the Don't Say Gay bill.  The legislation bans any discussion pertaining to 'sexual orientation' or 'gender identity' in Florida schools for students in kindergarten through third grade.  It will become law on July 1 and teachers who breach its regulations can be sued by parents.  'In Florida, we not only know that parents have a right to be involved, we insist that parents have a right to be involved,' DeSantis said at a press conference on March 28 before he signed the bill in to law.  'We will make sure that parents can send their kids to school to get an education, not an indoctrination.'  Critics, however, say it teaches young kids to believe they are wrong for being different and that forcing schools to report students who are receiving mental health services is taking away a safe space for those students to be themselves. They also claim that the vagueness of the wording could get a teacher in trouble if they make a passing reference to having a same-sex partner.   Even the White House weighed in on what has become the latest culture wars clash, with press secretary Jen Psaki claiming last week it was 'hateful' and 'misinformed'. DeSantis, last week also signed the Stop WOKE Bill into law, banning critical race theory (CRT) as a component in Florida schools, which the governor claims promotes hatred among students and makes individuals feel guilty for racism of the past. 'We believe an important component of freedom in the state of Florida is the freedom from having oppressive ideologies imposed upon you without your consent,' DeSantis said at the bill's signing, WFTS reported.  'Whether it be in the classroom or in the workplace. And we decided to do something about it.'  House Bill 7, also known as the Stop WOKE Bill, specifically outlaws teachings that assert certain individuals are 'inherently racist [or] sexist] - or 'morally superior' - or that characterize individuals' status as 'privileged' or 'oppressed' based on their race, sex or national origin.'  'What we will not allow is to be taught that members of one race, color, national origin or sex are somehow morally superior,' the governor said on Friday. 'We are not gonna allow teaching that a person simply by virtue of his/her race, color, national origin or sex is inherently racist, sexist or oppressive, that's wrong.'  Under the legislation, which also goes into effect on July 1, teachers are allowed to address topics of sexism, racism, slavery, and racial segregation but are not permitted to persuade students to a particular point of view. 'We are not gonna use your tax dollars to teach our kids to hate this country or to hate each other,' DeSantis said. Florida Sen. Manny Diaz, Jr., who pushed the bill through the senate, said the bill was not meant to cover up America's history with racism, but to not blame students for past wrongs.    'It's not about the feel. We can't control how a person feels about a topic,' Diaz told the Washington Post. 'But what we can control is to have a teacher not go to a student ... and impose on a male student that they are sexist simply because they are a considered a male.'  In a move that seems to be sweeping the nation, the Florida Department of Education also rejected 54 math textbooks from its curriculum due to the inclusion of banned material. The state DOE had garnered criticism for tossing out 41 percent of the 132 math textbooks submitted for the next school year last week without listing the rejected books, more than half of which the agency said referenced CRT, with the rest containing Common Core and Social Emotional Learning (SEL).  Last Thursday, the state released four examples of lessons considered unacceptable in the state, including the use of bar graphs that measures levels of racial prejudice based on age and political identity and asks students to solve equations based on the findings. The graphs, which extrapolated data from the Project Implicit Discrimination website, show that those 65 and older and who lean towards the conservative end of the political spectrum have the most racial bias.  Another example of banned material included a lesson plan for polynomials, with one of the problems once again referencing the Implicit Association Test, claiming that the 2 million people who have taken the test have 'slight' or 'moderate' bias, which changes based on age and political identification.  The department said the 54 books banned from the curriculum are prohibited because they are not 'aligned with Florida standards or included prohibited topics and unsolicited strategies.'  The fight over critical race theory in schools has escalated in the United States over the last year. The theory has sparked a fierce nationwide debate in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests around the country over the last year and the introduction of the 1619 Project. The 1619 Project, which was published by the New York Times in 2019 to mark 400 years since the first enslaved Africans arrived on American shores, reframes American history by 'placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans at the center of the US narrative'. The debate surrounding critical race theory regards concerns that some children are being indoctrinated into thinking that white people are inherently racist or sexist. Those against critical race theory have argued it reduces people to the categories of 'privileged' or 'oppressed' based on their skin color. Supporters, however, say the theory is vital to eliminating racism because it examines the ways in which race influence American politics, culture and the law.   Similarly, an Oklahoma library banned a display that was showcasing sexual assault awareness and a proposed 'romance book club' after both were deemed inappropriate.  The Public Library of Enid and Garfield County's Board of Directors had initially said the book club and the sexual assault awareness book display could stay, but then the Enid Public Library's board voted narrowly 3-2 to ban both the display and program. The board reasoned that the display featured content about sexuality, while the book club would discuss sexual topics, and that neither was appropriate for the library.  Enid Public Library's interim director Theri Ray told CNN the projects were shelved 'in accordance with the adopted policy.'  The policy itself is extremely broad and requires the library's programs and exhibits to be 'non-partisan' and 'not make as their object the study of sex, sexual activity, sexual perversion, sex-based classifications, sexual preferences, sexual identity, gender identity, or subjects that are of a sexual nature.'  Book bans have been at the heart of American controversy throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, which many alleging the bans violate the First Amendment.  Communities and education systems often ban books due to sexual imagery, violence and any other content that is deemed obscene.   Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel Uncle Tom's Cabin is widely recognized by historians as the first book in the U.S. to experience a ban on a national scale. In 2020, the American Library Association published a list detailing the top 100 most banned or challenged books nationwide over the last decade. Topping the list was The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian by Sherman Alexie, the Captain Underpants series by Dav Pilkey and Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher. During his speech Wednesday, Biden also shared personal testimony detailing how the educators and loved ones in his life helped him overcome his stutter.  'I wonder how I got here. I got here because of my parents and my teachers,' Biden said in a long, heart-felt deviation from his prepared remarks. 'That idea is exemplified by the national teacher of the year.' The president and First Lady Jill Biden, who continues to teach English at a community college in suburban Washington D.C., cheered for Ohio history teacher Kurt Russell, the 2022 national teacher of the year, and finalists for the award who gathered from each state.  'Teaching is not what Jill does, it's who she is, like most of you,' the president said, before telling the crowd about his problem as a child speaking - especially in class or otherwise publicly - 'when I stuttered, everyone thinks you're stupid. Totally incompetent.'  Biden has talked openly about battling a childhood stutter in the past, including while running for president in 2020. But he stressed on Wednesday the importance of teachers in helping him with that effort. 'I have teachers, I can name the ones through grade school, high school, even college,' the president said. 'I didn't really beat my stutter - and still occasionally I do (stutter) - until I took a speech debate class in college just to force myself to be able to stand up.' Russell summed up his profession by saying, 'Each student needs a champion, no matter what the circumstance are.' That echoed the sentiments of the first lady, who said of great teachers, 'it's not the curriculum or the classroom tactics, it's that smile that tells students that they don't have to be afraid to answer out loud.' 'It's the calm in your voice that can still the wild horses running through their hearts,' she added. 'It's the way that you know that, sometimes, 'I'm fine' means everything is wrong.' When Jill Biden talked about teachers changing lives 'student by student,' her voice began to crack, before she laughed and said 'Now I'm getting emotional.'",
  "96fb9babc6aee2cc0f4f479c8108cf3fe7975b2e1e9a8718b11a9bfe": "The Mexican teenager who was found dead inside a motel water tank was filmed  purchasing liquor with her two female friends and fighting with a young man outside a party, then walking on a road and later running into a motel before her mysterious death, new surveillance camera footage revealed. The videos obtained by Milenio television Wednesday show 18-year-old law student Debanhi Escobar arguing and being chased by an individual the morning of April 9 before she slapped and kicked him. Her two girlfriends and several young men then rushed over to intervene, according to the video. Moments later, another security video camera captured Escobar getting into the  back of a taxi driven by Juan David Cuellar, who snapped the last haunting photograph of Escobar standing on the side of a road. Another video shows Escobar, now sitting in the front passenger seat, getting out of the taxi near the Nueva Castilla Motel, where authorities discovered her body April 21. Prosecutors trying to piece together Escobar's movements after getting out of the cab also released a video showing her walking on a sidewalk and then crossing to the middle of a road before returning to the sidewalk.  She kept walking and briefly stopped in front of Transportes Internacionales Alcosa, a trucking company, at 4:29 am - three minutes after Cuellar took her photo. The attorney general's office provided additional video footage that showed the teenager running towards the motel driveway at 4:35 am and looking through the door of a restaurant located in front of the motel a minute later. Escobar then fell into one of the three uncovered cisterns, hit her head and drowned, according to Eduardo Villagomez, director of the state's forensic services 'She was alive (for a moment) where she was found and there was an opportunity for her to react,' he said. The cause of the death was a contusion to the skull and it is being investigated as a homicide, officials said.    It remains unclear if she accidentally fell into the cistern or was pushed.  The prosecutor's office said that the motel didn't have any surveillance cameras mounted in the area where the water tanks are located.  Attorney general Gustavo Guerrero, who has been trying to show transparency amidst accusations from the teenager's family that information from the investigation has been withheld, also announced the firings of prosecutors Rodolfo Salinas and Javier Caballero from the kidnapping and missing persons units for omitting details. 'We have to put together the puzzle with what we have and what is obtained to clarify the reason for Debanhi's death,' Guerrero said. Mario Escobar still is not ruling out that his daughter was murdered and has considered exhuming her body to conduct a second autopsy. 'There are many hypotheses, like my daughter could have been alive, like could she have been kidnapped, how she fell without seeing, how she could have been placed there,' he said. 'In other words, so that you understand me, we do not rule out any line of investigation. I think I am calm... because they are answering what we have talked about.' The family hopes the new details will help solve the mystery behind Debanhi Escobar's death. 'Unfortunately, my daughter is not here. But what my wife and I are asking for ... is that this case be clarified,' Mario Escobar said. 'We want everything to be clarified for us to be calm. Right now as a family we are calm in the aspect that we have somewhere to cry to my daughter, where to bring her a rose.' Debanhi Escobar was reported missing April after failing to return home following a night out with her two friends. Cuellar picked up the three young women after one of them requested a taxi via the DiDi ride share app. He dropped them off at a bar and gave them his personal number after they asked if he would be available to pick them up later that night. In an interview with INFO7 television on Tuesday night, Cuellar revealed he got a WhatsApp message around 4am from one of the two girls, but when he arrived, Escobar got into the vehicle and the friends took off in a separate car. Once inside the vehicle, Escobar told him that the girls were bad friends because they had left her behind. Cuellar recalled that she cried and he tried to get her home address to drop her off, but she refused to provide it. He then sent a message to one of the girls, requesting directions to Escobar's home, but she too declined to provide it. At one point, Escobar asked for a cellphone charging cable, stepped out from the rear passenger seat and sat in the front. Cuellar said Escobar was making incoherent comments and he again asked for her address. She asked Cuellar to drop her off at another party, but when they got to that location, she didn't get out. Cuellar said he eventually got her home address from her friends, but as he started to drive Escobar there, she asked him to stop and got out. 'That is where I took the photo and I notify her friend that she got out,' said Cuellar, who parked his car and then drove off after she refused to get back inside. 'From the first moment, I wanted to help her,' Cuellar said. 'I told her there was no problem. I'll take you to your house. Just tell me where you live.'",
  "dd1de4b23808ef3af193b30ce1fd8ef8a661834d32cbd8eae1a31f07": "Eleven months after weight-loss cult leader Gwen Shamblin died in a plane crash, survivors of her Tennessee church are coming forward to share horrifying details of the stringent starvation diets and brainwashing they faced - which led one former member to attempt suicide and left another with irreparable damage to her kidneys. 'Gwen broke my family and the only thing I can do is pick up the pieces, because that's what she left,' says Mindy Alvarez, a former member of the Remnant Fellowship Church, in the explosive two-part finale HBO Max docuseries The Way Down, which lifts the lid on the organization and the lasting trauma suffered by many of its members.  For Shamblin, dieting was divine.  Standing in stripper heels, a skin tight dress with stick thin legs and trademark frosted blonde six-inch bouffant - Shamblin was a charismatic church leader who created a Christian diet plan that became its own religion.  Every Saturday and Sunday, she took to the blue backlit stage of Remnant Fellowship under the auspices of God to preach to her 1,500 member flock the way 'to stop bowing down to the refrigerator and how to bow back down to Him.' Members were expected to pledge unshakable devotion to the cause. Should anyone question the controversial doctrine that rejected the Holy Trinity - or worse - gain weight, the consequences were punitive. Her reign of Remnant Fellowship came to an abrupt end on May 29, 2021, when her plane, also carrying six high-ranking church members, crashed into a shallow lake on their way to a MAGA rally. At the time of the accident, the finishing touches were being put on 'The Way Down: God, Greed and the Cult of Gwen Shamblin' which chronicled her rise from weight-loss guru with 'the Weigh Down Diet' plan - to fame, power and money with the founding of Remnant Fellowship in 1999. Now the streaming network is releasing a two-episode coda to The Way Down: God, Greed and the Cult of Gwen Shamblin, which originally aired in October 2021. The second installment explores the fallout from the cult leader's death--and how the insular Christian sect punished people for gaining weight, forced them to starve, urged parents to beat their children into submission, and enforced loyalty to the cause.  Sitting with filmmakers six months later, former member Ge'cobi Pittman says, 'I think I was nervous to speak up for years because Gwen was quick to seek legal action, but I just can't remain silent.'   'It's time that we heal, its time that our voices matter,' Laura Alvarez says. 'Even if it's for one person.'  Raised in the ultra-strict Church of Christ, Shamblin was a trained dietician who started her Weigh Down Workshops in the 1980s. The Weigh Down Workshops were held in churches and as word of mouth spread, grew to more than 250,000 subscribers in over 14,000 churches in 70 countries. She expanded her business throughout the 1990s with a merchandise, t-shirts, hats and a slew of books such as: What would Jesus eat?, The Divine Diet and Body by God. Her 1997 juggernaut was a book she published titled The Weigh Down Diet. Shamblin and her Weigh Down Diet were a 'massive media hit,' Rev. Rafael Martinez, a cult interventionist said. The book sold over 400,000 copies and Shamblin was seen everywhere from 20/20 to Larry King on CNN. She also embarked on national tours where followers would appear onstage holding up their larger clothes for a cheering audience: 'God has taken 86 pounds off of me!' Putting a biblical spin on her approach, Shamblin taught people to 'Honor God within your body.'  'Every time you reach for food, 15 to 20 times a day, run to God instead,' she'd say. In reality, her weight-loss approach was a dressed up version of intuitive eating, a decades-old practice of only eating when you're hungry. Martinez said: 'To her, it was divine revelation.' Terasseee Morris said that she started losing weight immediately. 'I mean like within two months, I had lost 27 pounds. So the program itself works and it's simply proportion control.'  In 1999, Shamblin founded Remnant Fellowship Church in Brentwood, Tennessee, with the emphasis on 'helping people turn away from the love of food and toward a love of God.'  Morris, who lost 138 pounds in 18 months, said that she was told to stop eating to lose more weight. If people didn't lose more than two pounds that week, they were instructed to fast. 'The faster you do it, the holier you are,' she said.  Soon thereafter, Shamblin began preaching that her weight-loss creed was effective at curing all the other perceived ills of the world, touting that Remnant members were able to break 'free from slavery, to drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, overeating and overspending.'  'I got counselled that, 'You need to loose about four pounds a week in order to be in God's good will,'' said Laura Alvarez, in the second installment of The Way Down. 'So then they put me at 10-bites-a-day,' she says. She was also told to fast every other month with absolutely no food, except for a few sips of broth. The extreme starvation diet caused so much damage to Alvarez's body that she got sick when she was pregnant for the first time. When doctors performed a biopsy, they asked if she struggled with bulimia or anorexia. 'I said, 'I starve myself,' and they said, 'Your body ate away its kidneys, that's what it does when you go through starvation.'' Defending her draconian dieting dogma to Larry King once, Shamblin said: 'How, in the Holocaust, did you have all these people getting down real skinny? They ate less food.' According to their website at the time, the church had 150 congregations located all over the world, with more than 1,500 acolytes worldwide, its membership 'has a combined weight loss of 30,000 pounds.' It described itself as a community where 'leaders are PURE...Husbands are kind like Christ, women are submissive, and children obey their parents'. 'How members of Remnant behave is bit like the Handmaid's Tale and Stepford Wives,' said Glen Wingerd, whose daughter Delaney married into the church. Their ultra-disciplined children were dressed in strangely old-fashioned clothing: 'I would say turn of the century ruffles,' says one ex-member, 'and lots of lace. The little boys looked like Little Lord Fauntleroy.' Shamblin's teachings came to focus increasingly on controlling those children.  Gradually, ex-members claim in the doc, church members became more brainwashed by Shamblin's teachings, which grew ever more outrageous.  If a congregant fell ill with cancer, gained weight, or had disobedient children, Shamblin declared that it was 'god's judgment.'  She told her followers that 'They had to repent for bad things they had done, if bad things were happening to them,' explained ex-member Gina Wilson in the doc. 'But they never held that same standard to themselves.'  Another tenant of the Shamblin doctrine was the harsh punishment and treatment of disobedient children. Her fellowship has been accused of inflicting corporal punishment with glue sticks, if they misbehaved.  Two members, Joseph and Sonya Smith, were convicted of murdering their eight-year-old son Josef Smith in 2007. He died after his parents put him a wicker box, Eleanor Odom, assistant district attorney for Cobb County in Georgia who tried the case, said in The Way Down. Josef kept popping up his head so his parents tied up the box with bungee cord so he couldn't get out, she said. 'At the end of the worship service, they didn't hear anything inside the box so they untied the box with the bungee cords and that's when they found Josef nonresponsive.' The EMTS who first responded talked about it being such a bad case, she said, and Josef had injuries pretty much everywhere except for the palms of his hands and the soles of his feet. Ge'cobi Pittman joined The Weigh Down with her mother when she was 14-years-old. 'Perfection was always the goal,' she said. Despite being a valedictorian with full-ride offers to Ivy League schools, she was pressured to move to Tennessee. 'I picked a small school in Nashville because I wanted to be closer to the church.' The ex-Shamblin devotee said she 'hit a breaking point' during her sophomore year and walked away from her scholarship. 'I was trying to be a perfect Division 1 athlete, a perfect student experiencing college for the first time, and then all the pressure to do everything the church wanted me to do while starving myself.'   Pittman recalled having one last conversation with Shamblin before leaving the church in 2015: 'I saw the darkness in her [Shamblin's] eyes finally when she realized that she wasn't able to get me to stay.' Adding, 'I had never seen her like that.' 'One way that cults control people's thinking, it's really simple, they teach you to minimize parts of the story that don't fit, they teach you to deny parts of the story that don't fit,' says cult expert, Adam Brooks. 'Minimize, denial, rewrite the narrative.'  Shamblin reigned with impunity by instilling guilt and fear into her congregants. 'She keeps a list of curses of people that happen to leave the church,' explains Pittman, who was pregnant at the time she quit Remnant. 'I was told that I would be cursed.' When she later suffered a miscarriage, she told HBO: 'I was fully convinced that I was cursed because of my disobedience.' It's taken years for Pittman to recover from the trauma and brainwashing she experienced in the Remnant Fellowship. 'Let's just say I'm happy to be here today because I almost took action a couple times to end the pain.'  Hawking Jesus and a diet plan made Shamblin fabulously wealthy. According to the documentary, she accrued $20million in real estate assets all over the country. She drove a Porsche, and lived in a pre-Civil War plantation home known as Ashlawn. After divorcing her husband of 40 years, Shamblin got remarried in 2018 to Joe Lara, a man best known for a 1989 TV movie Tarzan in Manhattan and the 1990s Tarzan TV series. One former member called him an 'escort' by a former church member in the series. Among the many expensive gifts that Shamblin lavished on her boy-toy were flight lessons. 'When he met Gwen he started to renew his pilot's license because he hadn't flown in seven and a half years until about 2017 when Gwen paid for it,' Natasha Pavlovich, Joe Lara's ex-girlfriend said in the finale of the doc. 'In a very short time, I'd say in a year, he got multiple new flight ratings and he also got a helicopter license.' Lara was piloting the Cessna 501 when it crashed into Percy Priest Lake on May 21, 2021, immediately killing all seven passengers on board, including his wife.  The second half of The Weigh Down series features the haunting moment air traffic control tried desperately in vain to contact the plane.  Shamblin afforded the high-life on the backs of her congregants. Within Remnant Fellowship, there were real estate and financial planning companies. Exodus Industries, which is the business arm of the church, built custom homes and provide plumbing, electrical work and air conditioning work. 'Everyone worked for free,' said Mindy Alvarez in the second installment of The Way Down. 'She would tell them 'You're doing it for God.' 'Everybody in the church, the congregation - were the workers, were cooks, there was daycare, there was everything, while they're making their money.' As a Spanish speaker, Mindy spearheaded The Weigh Down method to the Latin community in Arizona. 'Before I moved to Nashville they offered me a job,' she tells HBO. 'They offered to meet my pay, which at that time was probably $21 -$22 an hour.' When Mindy got her first paycheck for $8-an-hour, she asked Shamblin about the discrepancy. 'And I'll never forget this, she said, 'Mindy you need to humble yourself. This is your pay and never ever expect a raise.'  'I was sorry because I thought that I wasn't humble, and I shouldn't ask for more and that I should be content.' Mindy was also expected to work on the weekends, but because it was officially considered 'church time,' she never got paid for those days.'  Her daughter Laura, who also speaks in the finale of the series, says, 'she never saw her kids.'  'Gwen broke my family, and the only thing I can do is pick up the pieces because that's what she left,' Mindy told HBO. Shamblin promoted the notion that great things came to those who bowed before God, and that bad events were the consequence of unfaithfulness. Thus, her untimely demise, was an enormous complication for the church that sent them into an identity crises tailspin.  'When bad things happen, its God's judgement so if he takes seven of your leaders out at the same time, what other message could have been sent?' According them, this is gods judgment,' says Helen Byrd, an ex-devotee. 'A lot of what cults often do in situations like this is very Orwellian,' explained cult expert Adam Brooks. 'It will be almost ignored because it doesn't fit their narrative, that their leader was struck down in an accident that god could have protected her from.' Since The Way Down: God, Greed and the Cult of Gwen Shamblin first premiered in late 2021, the Remnant Fellowship has countered the negative publicity in a series of promotional videos that encourage inclusivity and emphasize their 'family friendly' values.  In one snip, a man wearing a white doctor's coat and goofy smile named Otis Rickman says, 'One of the things I'd like to touch on as we talk about people loosing weight or gaining weight is everyone is different. God made us all different so we have big sturdy muscular people, we have thin wispy people, we have just all kinds of people.' 'Otis Rickman put out this video that everybody's body is different right? And that nobody gets shunned or shamed or whatever when his wife was sat out of the church because she had gained wait, so that's a lie,' says Helen Byrd. 'It's the God**** remix!' As far as the future of the church without its dolled-up preacher, only time will tell. But the series offers some insights into the future of Shamblin's ministry without her guiding the way. While her daughter, Elizabeth Hannah, is expected to be heir-apparent, she has yet to officially take over the reigns. Instead, she's become more of a spectral Oz character, who patches in from behind the scenes over the loud speaker during service on the weekend. Elizabeth's husband, Brandon was one of the seven victims of the plane crash. 'I know that a lot of you have wondered how I'm doing, and if I'm throwing in the towel,' she says while speaking to her followers over the sound system from seclusion. 'Considering what has just happened I am doing very well, and I am very strong and my children are very strong. I just want to keep letting everybody know that even though I haven't been there recently, the precious leadership has allowed me to have a little time off.' Ex-member, Gina Wilson tells HBO: 'I don't know how Elizabeth is going to be able to do it, she's lost her husband, her mother and her best friend, but she was trained mightily by Gwen to be her mockingbird.'

  "50c092134b3ec2a1d24dd5c130ab98ccf65fb9e0a326e53c36024d50": "Sophie, Countess of Wessex hugged a group of children today on the final day of her Caribbean tour to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee as she and husband Prince Edward were all smiles while visiting a school in Saint Lucia. The Earl and Countess of Wessex visited Camille Henry Memorial School in the capital of Castries at the end of their week-long tour which has also taken them to Antigua and Barbuda, and St Vincent and the Grenadines. Sophie, who was wearing a long white dress, and Edward, who had a blazer and open-necked shirt, laughed as they spoke with the boys and girls and watched a performance - and they were also presented with gifts.  The school trip this morning came one day after the Queen was urged to apologise by Caribbean protesters seeking reparations after the Wessexes initially received a mixed reception during their visit to Saint Lucia. Edward and Sophie initially received a warm welcome to the island during a walkabout in the town of Soufriere, but were soon met by a group of around ten protesters before a trip to a cocoa plantation. One protester, who would not provide his name, told the PA news agency: 'We want reparations now. The Queen of England needs to apologise for slavery.' Another smiled and said: 'London Bridge is falling down.' The demonstrators displayed banners reading 'repatriation with reparations' and 'Queen say sorry' while playing drums and chanting. The protests follow similar demonstrations in St Vincent and the Grenadines, where some held signs saying 'compensation now' and 'Britain your debt is outstanding'. The earl and countess were also urged to use their 'diplomatic influence' to provide 'reparatory justice' by the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda during a visit to the country on Monday. Edward was criticised for his 'disinterest' in Gaston Browne's speech by anti-monarchist campaigners, after he was seen nervously laughing when asked to respond. The earl joked that he had not been taking notes during Mr Browne's opening remarks, so could not respond to all the points he had made. The prime minister did not laugh at the comment. Sophie and Edward initially experienced the warmest welcome they had received on their Caribbean tour during a walkabout in the town of Soufriere, with one man saying to Edward: 'I salute you, my prince.' The earl spoke to a road sweeper with a broom who was standing in front of the small crowd, and joked 'I hope you keep this lot in order' while pretending to wave the broom. Sophie and Edward were cheered as they left the area. The couple arrived at the Main Jetty in Soufriere by boat on Wednesday ahead of a busy schedule of engagements. The countess was presented with a bouquet of flowers by a boy named Carlos Baptise, 11, who has a spinal injury called congenital scoliosis. The couple then travelled past the small group of protesters to the Fond Doux Cocoa Plantation where they learned about the contribution of cocoa to Saint Lucia's economy. The countess had a go at grinding cocoa beans before meeting representatives from female-led businesses to hear about the impact of Covid-19 on trade and tourism. She also tried painting a purse at one of the stations, while the earl was taken to where the cocoa beans are dried in the sun. The pair then visited Sulphur Springs, where they were told about the history and evolution of the volcano. The countess put her hand in the water and said: 'It's as warm as a hot bath.' Sophie and Edward then had lunch with Saint Lucia's prime minister before travelling to Soufriere's Mini Stadium, where the earl and countess watched a performance celebrating the island's young people.     The couple joined in with dancers as they both waved small Saint Lucian flags. They then met and posed for photos with youngsters from a number of schools, including Soufriere's infant, primary, comprehensive and special education schools. Meanwhile, the Queen looked on cheery form today as she held a face-to-face audience with the president of Switzerland at Windsor Castle - her first official engagement since a week-long break on the Sandringham estate. The monarch smiled broadly as she shook hands and posed for photographs with Ignazio Cassis and his wife Paola in her Oak Room sitting room. Yesterday evening, her second son, the disgraced Duke of York, was stripped of his Freedom of York by councillors in the city, amid further calls for him to have his dukedom removed. The Queen returned to her Berkshire castle a day ago after staying at the late Duke of Edinburgh's Wood Farm cottage where she celebrated her 96th birthday. She stood without her walking stick and was dressed in a blue and grey paisley-style patterned silk dress for the audience on Thursday. She was wearing her fruit-themed sapphire and diamond grapes brooch, which features a sapphire bow and 16 small diamonds shaped like a bunch of grapes. It was inherited from the Queen Mother. Buckingham Palace said the sovereign is hoping to attend the State Opening of Parliament in less than two weeks' time, on May 10, but confirmation is expected closer to the time or on the day. Her high-profile Platinum Jubilee celebrations are just over a month away. The Queen, who has experienced mobility issues in recent months, has opened Parliament on all but two occasions during her reign. The exceptions were in 1959 and 1963, when she was pregnant with Andrew and then Prince Edward, when her speech was read by the Lord Chancellor.",
  "c585eed99e1cbaf9638c9049d34fcdba1e264baea2074040c6fc5371": "Russia must not be allowed to block Ukrainian grain exports and ramp up global prices, Ben Wallace warned today. The Defence Secretary said it is 'incredibly important' that Vladimir Putin's forces do not control the Black Sea, and the UK could supply anti-ship missiles. He also urged Western allies to help prise Moscow's forces out of the country like 'a limpet off the rock' - suggesting warplanes and tanks could be offered. The comments came as the UK Ministry of Defence said that despite the losses of the cruiser Moskva and the landing ship Saratov, Russia's Black Sea Fleet retains the ability to strike targets in Ukraine. In its latest intelligence assessment it said the Russian navy currently had around 20 vessels in the area, including submarines. Mr Wallace said it was vital that Ukraine, which previously supplied around 7 per cent of the world's wheat, continued to have access to the Black Sea as an outlet for its exports. There have been fears spiking food prices will add to the cost-of-living pain for families, already struggling to cope with soaring fuel and energy bills. 'We have said we will source and supply, if we can, anti-ship missiles,' Mr Wallace told Sky News. 'It's incredibly important that the grain that affects us all, the food prices, does get to get out of Ukraine, that the Russians can't control the Black Sea.' In a keynote speech yesterday, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the objective should be to drive Russia out of 'the whole of Ukraine'. Mr Wallace said it had always been the position of the international community that Russia should withdraw from Ukrainian territory since President Vladimir Putin's annexation of Crimea. However, he said there was 'a long way to go' before the Ukrainians were able to reclaim the land it lost in 2014. He said the Russians appeared to be preparing to dig in to the territory they seized in the east of the country in their latest invasion. 'We've constantly said that Russia should leave Ukraine sovereign territory so that hasn't changed,' he said. 'I think it's certainly the case that Putin, having failed in nearly all objectives, may seek to consolidate what he's got, sort of fortify and dig in, as he did in 2014, and just be a sort of cancerous growth within the country of Ukraine and make it very hard for people to move them out of those fortified positions,' he said. 'So I think it's really about if we want this to not happen, we have to help Ukrainians effectively get the limpet off the rock and keep the momentum pushing them back.' In her speech at the Mansion House, Ms Truss said the crisis in Ukraine should be a 'catalyst' for an overhaul to the West's approach to international security. She said the UK needed to strengthen its military while building alliances with free nations around the world, using their economic power to deter aggressors who 'do not play by the rules'. The G7 group of leading industrialised nations should act as an 'economic Nato' defending collective prosperity, while the Western military alliance must be prepared to open its doors to countries such as Finland and Sweden. Ms Truss singled out China, which has refused to condemn the invasion of Ukraine, while increasing imports from Russia and commenting on 'who should or shouldn't be a Nato member'. 'China is not impervious. They will not continue to rise if they do not play by the rules,' she said. 'China needs trade with the G7. We have shown with Russia the kind of choices that we're prepared to make when international rules are violated.'",
  "3db415f5ecfdbf50fb533e06b27ee59743a1f393377e21daa8b779c7": "President Joe Biden on Thursday asked Congress for an additional $33 billion in military and humanitarian assistance for the Ukraine, which officials say could fund the war there for the next five months. Biden said the previous money allocated for the Ukrainians has been spent. 'Basically we're out of money,' he said in remarks at the White House.  The money includes $20.4 billion in additional security and military assistance, $8.5 billion in economic assistance, and $3 billion in humanitarian assistance. 'We need to contribute arms funding ammunition and the economic support to make their courage and sacrifice have purpose so they can continue this fight and do what they're doing. It's critical this funding gets approved and approved as quickly as possible,' Biden said. 'We have to do our part as well leading the alliance. The cost of this fight, it's not cheap, but caving to aggression is going to be more costly if we allow it to happen. We either back Ukrainian people as they defend their country or we stand by as Russia continues it atrocities and aggression in Ukraine,' he noted. The humanitarian assistance includes funds for high thermal blankets, medical supplies, emergency health kits, safe drinking water, direct food support such as wheat and flour, job training, trauma-informed mental health services, and funding for schools. Biden said the funding for food will help ease rising prices back in the United States.  Ukraine is a major producer of wheat and sunflowers. The war there has disrupted the supply line and caused a price hike. 'This one is going to help ease rising food prices at home as well and abroad,' Biden claimed.  The $33 billion request is more than double the $13 billion that Biden asked for last month and lawmakers approved. The Biden administration has sent more than $2.4 billion in assistance to the Ukraine. 'The president's funding request is what we believe it needed to enable Ukraine success over the next five months of this war,' a senior administration official told reporters on a briefing call.  Biden, in a letter to lawmakers formally making the request, appeared to ask Congress to tie the Ukraine aid to $22.5 billion in covid pandemic response funding he requested in March. Democrats wanted to tie Ukraine and covid aid together as Republicans tried to tie an effort to extend the Title 42 health order at the border to the covid funding request.  But White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Thursday that was not the case. 'We're not making a predetermination of that from here,' she said at her press briefing. 'We put forward both of these funding are requested because they're both vital. They're both important. We need them both to help the Ukrainians and to help ensure we're continuing our COVID programs here in this country and around the world. But we're not going to predetermine for Congress, how they move forward.'  Biden said the covid money is urgently needed to have money for additional vaccines and theraputics in order stop the spread of the disease in the U.S. and abroad. 'The reason we were so successful in the past is because I was able to work with drug manufacturers to order significant quantities of material we needed ahead of time to get in the front of the line. Without additional funding, we can't preorder the amount of vaccines we need and we risk losing our spot in line for vaccines,' he said.  Republican senators, however, had said without a vote on an amendment on Title 42, then there will be no covid funding bill. Democrats in the Senate need at least 10 Republican votes to move the legislation forward but leaders are in a tough spot as enough Democrats may support the Title 42 amendment to get it attached.  Biden also wants to sell the luxury yachts and opulent apartments the U.S. government has seized from Russian oligarchs and then send that money to the Ukraine to help them fight off Vladimir Putin's forces.   The president on Thursday asked Congress to expand his presidential powers to allow him to do just that. 'Seize yachts, fund the war,' White House chief of staff Ron Klain tweeted about the request. Additionally, Biden asked lawmakers for billions of dollars in additional U.S. spending to help the Ukrainian military and provide humantarian assistance for its displaced population. And he asked lawmakers to make it a criminal offense for a person to 'knowingly or intentionally possess proceeds directly obtained from corrupt dealings with the Russian government,' double the statute of limitations for foreign money laundering offenses to 10 years, and expand the definition of 'racketeering' under U.S. law to include efforts to evade sanctions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said last week that his country had - thus far - suffered $550 billion in economic damage since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion. The country is seeking at least $5 billion per month in international emergency aid. Biden's request comes as there has been a bipartisan push in Washington to more aggressively punish the Russian elite, a group of billionaires - many of whom have made their money off of Putin's regime. The Biden administration has already sanctioned about two dozen oligarchs and their family members, even targeting Putin himself. More than a dozen yachts, worth approximately $2.5 billion, have been seized in several countries worldwide, including the 'Tango' - a 254-foot yacht to Viktor Vekselberg, a billionaire and close Putin ally, that is worth an estimated $120 million.  It was seized by the U.S. from its Spanish port earlier this month. It was the first U.S. seizure of an oligarch's yacht since Attorney General Merrick Garland and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen assembled a task force known as REPO -- short for Russian Elites, Proxies and Oligarchs --  to enforce the sanctions put in place after Putin invaded the Ukraine. The federal government 'has sanctioned and blocked vessels and aircraft worth over $1 billion, as well as frozen hundreds of millions of dollars of assets belonging to Russian elites in U.S. bank accounts,' the White House said.  The administration also noted that European Union member states have reported freezing over $30 billion in assets, including almost $7 billion in boats, helicopters, real estate and artwork.  Russia's billionaires control roughly 30 percent of the nation's wealth.  And lawmakers already have pushed to use those seized assets to help the Ukraine.  The House on Wednesday passed a mostly symbolic measure urging Biden to sell the oligarchs' frozen assets to give the money to the Ukraine military and humanitarian assistance.   The legislation is nonbinding, but its 417-to-8 passage reflected the desire among Democrats and Republicans to more aggressively tamp down on Russia. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said it would be taken up by the Senate, where it is expected to pass.   But the Justice Department needs a congressional change in statue to sort through the mess of legal issues that will need to be unraveled so the United States to repurpose the yachts and extravagant apartments into de facto reparations for Ukrainians. In his State of the Union address on March 1, President Biden warned oligarchs that the U.S. and European allies would 'find and seize your yachts, your luxury apartments, your private jets.' 'We are coming for your ill-begotten gains,' he said.",
  "a43301768b4b21f59ee8ce857ea9878fa401775c5152895d0e743dab": "Kenosha's city council fell into chaos this week during discussions over a proposed taxpayer-funded memorial for one of the men killed by Kyle Rittenhouse after an attendee questioned the commission's move to table the proposal instead of voting it down. The Monday meeting, which was captured on video, saw the city's five-person Parks Commission delay a decision that would have placed a memorial and plaque in a city park to honor Anthony Huber, an ex-convict skateboarder shot dead by Rittenhouse during a Black Lives Matter protest in 2020. Video shows Huber, 26, chasing after a then-17-year-old Rittenhouse on August 25, 2020, swinging his skateboard at the teen before being fatally shot in the chest.  Rittenhouse was acquitted of the murder last year. He was also cleared for shooting dead one other person and wounding another.  Huber's girlfriend, Hannah Gittings, requested the memorial be put up earlier this month, public documents filed by the commission show, on a tree in Anderson Park. The proposal garnered national attention earlier this week, after Kevin Mathewson, a former Kenosha alderman who now works as an investigative journalist, received a tip early Monday morning about the then-unreported request. Mathewson, who served on the commission with three of the five current aldermen - including chair Eric Haugaard - then sent out an email blast about the proposal's existence, and wrote about it on his website, Kenosha County Eye. The proposal soon became the subject of scrutiny by both the press and outraged citizens of Kenosha - who showed up in droves to the commission meeting to voice their opposition to the planned tribute. Mathewson, who also attended the meeting and recorded the proceedings to post to YouTube, told DailyMail.com Thursday that he believes the council members planned to quietly the proposal Monday, and would have if its existence had remained under the radar. Scroll down for video:  'There's not a doubt in my mind it would have passed,' Matthewson told DailyMail.com in an interview, noting the meetings usually don't garner such attendance. 'They didn't expect a bunch of people to be there.' Mathewson's footage of the meeting, which was streamed live and has since garnered more than 35,000 views, shows a slew of citizens voicing their concerns regarding the memorial, spurring the city officials to vote 3-2 to table the proposal. At that point, roughly 21 minutes into the clip, Mathewson - who told DailyMail.com that the board met privately to discuss the vote shortly before the meeting, which is against Wisconsin law - asks to speak, sparking an exchange that saw the former Kenosha alderman accuse the board of violating the state's open meetings laws. 'Thanks for allowing me to speak again,' an off-screen Mathewson can be heard saying in the footage, before leveling his suspicions at the commission. 'I just wanted to point out to those of us watching on Youtube [at] home - three members of this board of five say we're gonna table it. You know what that means right? A quorum of this board met behind closed doors today-' Before Mathewson can finish his thought, the clips shows Alderman Haugaard, said he was in favor of tabling the proposal due to an ongoing lawsuit between the city and Huber's family, frantically bang his gavel in an apparent effort to get Mathewson to stop talking. After a brief pause, Mathewson asks Haugaard, a former colleague, 'Am I lying? 'You are,' Haugaard responds, accusing Mathewson of 'misconstruing' the situation and its subsequent illegality, asserting that council member spoke 'one-on-one,' which is not against the law.  'I know you don't like it-' Mathewson begins to say in the clip, spurring Haugaard to interrupt and start shouting at the ex-alderman. 'There are open records lost sir, and what you said is false. If you have one-on-one conversations-' 'Did you talk about it or not?' Mathewson then says. 'With others on this board - yes or no?' Haugaard begins to respond: 'We talked about-' Before the city official can finish, Mathewson snipes, 'Of course you did.'  This again seemingly sets of Haugaard, who again begins shouting: 'You can talk one-on-one. You cannot ever stand here-' 'Are you gonna let me to speak?' Mathewson then asks, before Haugaard allows him to proceed. Mathewson continues: 'So, the chairman and other members of this body -three of them, which is the majority - violated the law-' Before he can get his sentence in, Haugaard again begins to bang the gavel repeatedly, with deafening intensity. 'And this guy's going nuts,' a trailed off Mathewson remarks in the clip, following Haugaard's outburst. 'Because... because you're misconstruing the law,' Haugaard stammers in the footage. Mathewson goes on to address the alderman by name, accusing Haugaard and other board members of tabling the proposal solely due to the attention it was then receiving, and urging the board to vote to reject Gittings' request. 'I understand that you're taking the coward's way out and you don't like that i'm calling you out, Eric,' Mathewson says, 'but these people you just heard, we want you to say no today. 'You want to hold it out here for a day that we're all worried about some other war, then you're going to quietly pass it - we know how you guys work. We know how the government works. 'You broke the law when you had a meeting behind closed doors with-' At this point in the footage, Mathewson is again interrupted, by another alderman who loudly called for a brief recess. 'And now you don't want to hear it,' Matthewson remarks in the footage.  'I just want people to be aware that three of you said we're tabling it.   'All five of you are gonna unanimously agree - which means you all five talked about this. You can't do that! That's a walking quorum. That's a quorum,' referring to the alleged gathering the members had prior to the official open meeting.   'You guys broke the law,' Mathewson continues. 'I know you don't want to hear it; and if you want to slam the gavel like a lunatic, doesn't change what you did is wrong. 'And if you want to be a coward and kick it down the line, that's your prerogative. 'It's not going to affect the lawsuit. They said that the police department is responsible for what Kyle did, and the jury said Kyle didn't do anything wrong,' Matthewson proceeds to point out. 'Just do the right thing, and for once stop playing political games.' Another speaker, Kenosha resident Kathy Woods echoed Mathewson's sentiments, saying, 'Of all the bone head things you guys could consider. Don't consider this.' Woods added, 'This is an insult to the people who have memorials. Who have done good things.' The initial decision regarding the proposal was upheld, and left to be discussed later date - a timetable that could span years, Matthewson told DailyMail.com. If the commission votes to move forward with the proposal, the responsibility for the upkeep would fall on Gittings.  The shooting occurred amid nights of violent protests in the city following the non-fatal shooting by police of black domestic abuser Jacob Blake.  During arguments on the issue, Huber's past criminality, including a domestic abuse charge, was brought up. It is unclear if that will ultimately sway a decision on whether to give him a memorial.   In 2018, Huber found guilty of domestic abuse and disorderly conduct. While in 2012, Huber spent time in prison following a choking incident involving his brother. Huber was fatally wounded after Rittenhouse shot him in the chest. Huber had hit Rittenhouse with a skateboard prior to being mortally wounded. In his obituary, Huber was referred as being a passionate skateboarder who was known for his 'quick wit and comedic personality.'  The skateboarder had given chase after Rittenhouse shot-and-killed another man, 36-year-old convicted pedophile Joseph Rosenbaum. Despite the killing of Huber, Gittings told The New York Post in a November 2021 interview, 'I do have a lot of sympathy for [Rittenhouse] because he is just a kid to me so it was just like a really dumbass kid who unfortunately became the figurehead for this.'  Gittings went on to lay some of the blame for Huber's death at the feet of the city of Kenosha saying, 'Kenosha also needs to be held responsible for allowing this militia to show up and do exactly what they came here to do.'",
  "c709bf4dec7169ab361ff290be8e30d005e65d51f8396a12769f7f9d": "Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned during a Thursday speech that 'large negative shocks' to the economy are inevitable as the United States continues to grapple with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and global disruptions caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Biden administration official advocated for greater safeguards against financial downturns, warning they are 'likely to continue to challenge the economy.' She explained the Great Recession after the 2008 financial crisis taught policymakers like her to correct the negative course 'as quickly as possible.'  It comes after inflation hit a 41-year high of 8.5 percent in March, according to the Labor Department. The economy's rebound from the worst of the pandemic has sent consumer prices for everything from gas, rent to groceries soaring for much of President Joe Biden's term.  March's inflation report, the most recent available, presented the full scope of the Russian invasion's impact on American consumers.  Russia's autocrat leader Vladimir Putin ordered his unprovoked attack on February 24, disrupting the precarious global food and energy supply chains.  However, any mention of inflation was notably absent from Yellen's Thursday remarks at the Brookings Institute, according to Bloomberg. She instead presented a vehement defense of the president's COVID-19 spending package, which -- along with two similar bills signed by Donald Trump -- has been blamed by some economists for over-stimulating the economy and fueling today's out-of-control inflation. 'These responses played major roles in igniting a robust recovery,' Yellen argued. She added that Biden's American Rescue Plan and Trump's packages 'played major roles in igniting a robust recovery' in 2021 as public health restrictions were beginning to lift and vaccines were becoming available.  However, inflation outpacing record gains in wages and job growth means Biden's critics and Republican lawmakers have still been able to use the consumer price spike as a political cudgel.  But on Thursday, Yellen claimed the steps were necessary in a time of sheer 'uncertainty.' 'Throughout 2020, and into 2021, the path of the pandemic, including its severity and the role of future viral strains could not be predicted,' she said. Failure to support the economy adequately, Yellen said, could have brought 'a downturn that could match the Great Depression.'  She called for countries to establish 'recession remedies' to prevent what she predicted are virtually certain future economic spirals. 'Improved understanding of breaks in supply chains, increases in commodity prices, bursting of asset bubbles, and labor and productivity shocks can help policymakers implement reforms that bolster our economic resilience,' Yellen said. The Treasury chief also held up Biden's electric vehicles and clean energy production push as another way to cushion future market downturns. Biden's administration has been under fire by Republicans for refusing to lease new oil and gas drilling permits to mitigate soaring gas prices. Russia's disruption of supply lines and the president's import ban on Moscow's energy have contributed to fuel prices rising above $6 per gallon in parts of the country last month. As of Thursday the average price at the pump still exceeds $5 in California and Nevada. But Yellen said Biden's push for green fuel as a way to reach energy independence 'will mitigate our future vulnerability to oil price shocks.'  'At the same time, they will abet the transition to cleaner energy sources which will, in due course, lessen the risks tied to natural disasters and climate change,' she explained. She delivered the remarks just hours after it was revealed the U.S. economy had shrunk in the first quarter of 2022. The country's gross domestic product (GDP), a broad measure of the economy's health, fell by 1.4 percent in the period of January through March, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. It's the worst economic showing since U.S. markets were plunged into chaos by the pandemic in the second quarter of 2020. The last quarter of 2021, by contrast, saw a record 6.9 percent growth pace.

Aspiring lawyer Sven Badzak, 22, was set upon by up to six youths as he was walking along Willesden Lane, Kilburn, north west London, with his 16-year-old friend. Mr Badzak and the teenager were getting orange juice before going to a bagel shop before they were chased at around 5.30pm on 6 February 2021 and got separated in the pursuit. The attackers caught up with Mr Badzak and he was knifed repeatedly. He was later pronounced dead at the scene. His 17-year-old friend, who cannot be named, also suffered multiple stab injuries but managed to escape into a shop in Willesden Lane. Rashid Gedel and Shiroh Ambersley, both 21, and a 17-year-old appeared at the Old Bailey on Thursday via video-link from HMP Belmarsh, charged with murdering Mr Badzak. They sat next to eachother in a prison conference room all wearing face masks as the Recorder of London, Judge Mark Lucraft, confirmed they will stand trial on 18 July. Gedel, Ambersley and the 17-year-old denied murdering Mr Badzak and attempting to murder his friend at an earlier hearing. Anthony Orchard, QC, prosecuting, earlier, said it was clear Mr Badzak was a victim of mistaken identity. 'Sven Badzak was pronounced life extinct at 6.28pm that evening,' he said. 'Neither victim was a gang member or associate. They were victims of mistaken identity.' Sven's mother, former Conservative Party activist Jasna Badzak, said her son had gone to a shop to get orange juice and then to the bagel shop when he was attacked. Sven was privately educated in London at Wetherby and Portland Place schools before attending Roehampton University. Gedel, Ambersley and the 17-year-old were all remanded in custody ahead of the trial.",
  "bf74785673e591014b52c578666ddf27603c4c469f94d62f1a350c1d": "An Argentine diver found a buried treasure - an engagement ring - at the bottom of a lake in the Patagonia region that brought back bittersweet memories when he returned the gold band to its rightful owner. Marcos Ponce, 48, was coming home from a vacation last month with his family and friends in Ushuaia, a resort town on the southernmost tip of South America, when they decided to stop to snorkel in the Santa Cruz province's the Lake of the Desert. The lawyer told digital news outlet Infobae that he was joined by his best friend Hugo Bottaro and spent nearly 50 minutes underwater, but as they were ready to return to shore, he decided to continue ahead and snap some additional photos. As he focused his camera, Ponce was bothered by a shiny object lying next to the wooden column of a dock that prevented him from getting a quality picture.  He swam towards the dock and grabbed the object without knowing what it really was. When he surfaced, he discovered that it was an 18-karat gold ring. He figured it was a wedding or engagement ring and that someone had accidentally dropped it in the lake. Ponce, who has been going on diving excursions for 20 years, kept the ring at home and on Sunday thought it was perfect time to find its rightful owner. He took to his social media networks and posted photos of the ring on Facebook and Instagram. The post was shared thousands of times and had hundreds of comments in the first two hours. An hour later, a woman from the Santa Cruz town of Rio Turbio direct messaged Ponce to claim the ring. The owner of the ring - whose name has been withheld by Ponce to maintain her privacy - was able to confirm the engraved date - March 21, 2015 - in the inside part of the ring along with her former girlfriend's last name, D'Amico. It represented the date she and her ex-partner had gotten engaged. The woman told Ponce that she had moved to Buenos Aires after accepting her partner's proposal and then kept the 18-karat gold ring after they mutually agreed to go different ways over a year ago.  She eventually returned to Rio Turbio and while visiting the lake in January decided it was finally time to get rid of the ring and tossed it in the Lake of the Desert. 'She admitted that she always thought about getting rid of the ring, but that she wanted to do it in a special way and that's how this summer she traveled to the Lake of the Desert and threw it into its waters,' Ponce said. Ponce also got a message from the woman's ex-girlfriend, who was able to confirm the same details. However, he decided he will be mailing it out to D'Amico instead this week. 'If fate brings this ring back to me, she'll come back somehow,' D'Amico told Ponce.",
  "b14568d0a2a14f1c938c83d60bf6e52f34eb2c61b69bf5efb2b5f9d2": "Paul Auster's son Daniel died in the hospital on Tuesday six days after being found unconscious having overdosed on drugs on a Brooklyn subway station platform.  NYPD officials on Thursday confirmed that he was found at 9.48am on the northbound G platform at the Clinton Street subway in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn.  He was taken to the hospital but died on Tuesday.   It brings a sad end to a tragic saga that began when his ten-month-old daughter Ruby died in November.  She had ingested fentanyl while her father took a nap in their Park Slope apartment. He found her blue and unresponsive after waking up.  Daniel told police at the time that he'd just injected heroin when the pair lay down to sleep.  His wife, Zuzan Smith, told police she trusted him with their daughter.  It's unclear what happened in the following six months but on April 16, Daniel was charged with his daughter's death.  He was released on bond on April 17 by Brooklyn Judge John Hecht, who demanded a $100,000 cash bail or $250,000 bond. It's unclear who met those bond requirements.  On April 20 - four days after his arrest - he overdosed in the subway station.  Ruby's mother, Zuzan Smith, has not commented on his death, nor has the Brooklyn District Attorney whose office let him go free.  A DA office spokesman on Thursday would only confirm that they had been informed of his death on Tuesday and that it brought an end to the case. It is unclear if he was living with Zuzan when he died, or if the pair were separated.  'On Wednesday, April 20,2022 at 0948hrs at Washington Avenue/Clinton Street subway station, police officers observed an unconscious 44-year-old male on the northbound G train platform, administered CPR along with FDNY and the individual was removed by EMS to Brooklyn Hospital in stable condition but was later pronounced deceased on Tuesday, April 26,2022,' an NYPD spokesman said on Thursday.  The New York Post first reported Daniel's death.  Daniel's father, Paul Auster, 75, has won numerous international awards for his books, which include titles such as The New York Trilogy,' 'The Book of Illusions,' and 'Moon Palace.' In 2017, he was nominated for the Booker Prize for his novel '4, 3, 2, 1', and his work has been translated into more than forty languages. In Auster's 1995 film about the lives of people who frequented a Brooklyn tobacco shop, Smoke - which starred Harvey Keitel and William Hurt - Daniel played the role of a book thief.  His mother is author and translator Lydia Davis, 74.  Davis and Paul Auster divorced in 1978; in 1982, he remarried, tying the knot with author Siri Hustvedt, and the couple have one daughter together, musician Sophie Auster, 34. A woman believed to be Siri was seen leaving the couple's Park Slope home on Thursday.  No one from the family has commented on Ruby's death, Daniel's arrest or his death earlier this week.  During his teenage years, Auster started going to clubs in New York City and became heavily involved with drugs, according to The New Yorker. At the age of 18, in 1996, Auster was present in the apartment when a drug dealer, Andre 'Angel' Melendez, was murdered by 'Club Kid Killer' Michael Alig, a former nightclub promoter, and his roommate, Robert Riggs.  Auster was given $3,000 of Melendez's money in exchange for his silence. He later pleaded guilty to possession of stolen property and was given five years probation.  Auster had a string of arrests including several drug possession charges in 2008 and 2010.  In 2009 he was charged with petit larceny and possession of stolen property.  Auster in April claimed his baby daughter died of a fentanyl overdose after he took heroin then went to take a nap with the child by his side while his wife worked, a court heard.  The vivid account allegedly given to the NYPD by Auster was shared by Assistant District Attorney Tien Tran at his arraignment hearing on manslaughter charges. The infant's mother, Zuzan Smith, told police that their daughter, Ruby, was awake and alert when she left her in Auster's care and went to work. A criminal complaint obtained by DailyMail.com states that Auster told police that shortly after Smith left their home, he injected heroin and then got into bed for a nap with the child by his side.  When he woke up from his nap, she was 'blue, lifeless and unresponsive', the complaint states.  The prosecutor said that the girl had enough drugs in her system to 'render an adult unconscious.'  It's still unclear how the girl ingested the drugs, but Auster confessed that he kept heroin in his bathroom.  At the time his lawyer, James Godfrey, told The New York Times that he was recently sober and was in drug treatment. 'This case is painfully tragic, and Mr Auster remains devastated over the loss of his beloved daughter Ruby,' the lawyer told the paper. 'Substance use disorder is an issue that countless families reel from each year, and we caution the public to refrain from making any rush to judgment.'  An autopsy conducted by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner a few days later found Ruby died of acute intoxication caused by the combined effects of fentanyl and heroin.  Auster, who worked as a landscaper, posted photos of his child and Smith on his Instagram page before jetting off to Mexico and Columbia in January. On his travels, he seemed to be backpacking like a college student, and taking in several raves. Auster and his father appeared to be estranged, but Auster wrote Daniel into his work. In his 2004 novel, Oracle Night, the book is narrated by a writer called Trause whose son is a drug addict who terrorizes his stepmother. During a 2006 Guardian interview, Paul Auster's second wife Siri Hustvedt who is also a writer, declined to speak about her stepson.    'Yes. You know, I'm not going to talk about any of that, no. No,' she said, her eyes reportedly beginning to water.  'You know, I am married to a writer, and this - writing - is an odd enterprise.  'It's something we both support very strongly.  'I've always been behind Paul, and he's always been behind me.  'I have a very strong family.' ",
  "f732355650853a0071a910345333c336a742d439e07a8a36008d2d9b": "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said Thursday that she'd like to invite Elon Musk to Capitol Hill after his Twitter takeover - and would assemble a group of 'brilliant' people banned from the network to have a conversation with him. 'I don't know Mr. Musk, but I do invite him to come talk with me in Washington, D.C. I would be happy to put together a roundtable of all the most brilliant people who have been unjustly banned from Twitter and he can see for himself the urgent necessity of doing right by them,' Greene told reporters at a press conference outside the Capitol. 'Which we all hope he will as he has stated he believes in free speech.  Greene said to the crowd: 'We don't need to be told what we can and can't say online by nutcases in San Francisco or other places.' She told DailyMail.com she hasn't officially made the ask to Musk, but did name some of her ideal attendees.  'There would be a lot of people I'd love to invite to this roundtable. I see someone standing behind you right there - Milo Yiannopoulus - I think he'd be a great person to have there,' she said.  Yiannopoulos was banned from Twitter in 2016 over his engagement in the racist and targeted abuse of comedian Leslie Jones, who is black.  'Alex Jones would be another person,' Greene went on.  Jones was banned from Twitter in 2018, with the company saying he engaged in 'abusive behavior.'  He's widely known as a right-wing conspiracy theorist.   'We'll put together a great list of people who have been just almost deleted from public life due to this type of censorhip and I think Elon Musk will enjoy talking to them,' Greene said.  Greene's personal Twitter account got suspended in January after she repeatedly posted content that violated the company's policy on COVID-19 misinformation.  She still has access to her Congressional account.   Greene told reporters Thursday she wanted her personal Twitter account reinstated.  'On my Congressional Twitter account, for all of us here, we're not allowed to talk about our campaigns or ask for money, say, to defend ourselves in court from political attacks and things like that. So it's important to me to have my personal Twitter account,' she explained.  'I am cautiously optimistic about the prospects for Twitter now that Elon Musk has taken over,' she also said. Greene's main reason for hosting a press conference was to tout legislation - the 21st Century Free Speech Act - that she's introducing alongside Sen. Bill Hagerty, who's sponsoring the same bill in the upper chamber.  The bill would scrap Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act and replace it with 'reasonable, non-discriminatory access to online communications platforms' that would treat so-called Big Tech as a 'common carrier,' similar to an airline or FedEx, Greene said.  Greene said that illegal activity like child trafficking would remain unlawful - but suggested it would make it more difficult for tech companies to patrol misinformation.  'I don't believe in this whole misinformation thing that the Democrats are wanting to push on people,' she said, adding that it was 'their term for silencing free speech.'  'For example, parents' ability to say I want to protect my daughters in their bathrooms and in their sports - that can be considered hate speech or misinformation, or people's ability to say - I don't want the government forcing me to take a vaccine,' Greene said. 'I'd like to have full control over my own health and choose if I would like to use my own natural immunity against the biological weapon of COVID-19.' 'People that said things like that were permanently banned on social media,' she noted. She said that anti-trans and anti-vax opinions weren't 'misinformation.'  'That's people expressing their own views, their own opinions and that's their freedom of speech and they have the right to make those decisions and Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, no other big tech company has the right to remove them for saying things like that,' Greene said.

  "b0c08dbef7d81a8242f371c29ea5a88f9e14a7d77ecf5bb98f296dbe": "Boris Becker was today spotted visiting Harrods, a Notting Hill council estate and seeing his son on what could be his last day of freedom before he faces up to seven years in prison after concealing hundreds of thousands of pounds following his bankruptcy.  The prospect of jail appeared to weigh heavy on the former tennis star, who looked haggard as he walked alone through areas of London wearing a grey jacket, jeans, trainers and a baseball cap.  The three-time Wimbledon champion, 54, was seen going into a side entrance of the Harrods department store in Knightsbridge, while he was also photographed today in the Paddington and Notting Hill areas. It is unclear if he bought anything at the department   At around 11am, he visited a flat in Notting Hill, where a woman answered the door and embraced him. He later left the flat at 12.45pm. It is unclear who Becker was visiting at the council estate.   The former tennis star was also seen meeting with his son ahead of his sentencing tomorrow.   Yesterday, he was seen being hugged by his girlfriend Lilian de Carvalho Monteiro after spending 'family time' with his son and estranged wife Lilly Becker days earlier.  The German star-turned-commentator was found guilty of four charges under the Insolvency Act in a trial this month.  A London court heard he transferred PS350,000 to other accounts, hid a property in Germany and failed to declare 75,000 shares in an IT firm and a PS700,000 loan.  The father-of-four was legally obliged to disclose all his assets after being declared bankrupt in 2017. The London-based former world number one now faces losing lucrative contracts with TV networks around the world, including his job as a BBC pundit at Wimbledon.  Yesterday Becker, who won tennis fans' hearts in the 1980s with his all-action style of play, was embraced by his girlfriend as he smoked during a break in a meeting with documentary maker George Chignell in London. Last weekend, he was pictured with Lilly and their 12-year-old boy in south London before the father and son met up with his current girlfriend. Becker will learn his fate at Southwark Crown Court tomorrow morning.  Becker's mother Elvira Becker, 86, has begged a judge not to send her son to jail, saying earlier this month that he is 'a decent boy overall', adding: 'I hope my son doesn't have to go to prison.'  During his trial, Becker told a jury how his PS38 million career earnings were swallowed up by an expensive divorce to his first wife Barbara Becker, child maintenance payments and 'expensive lifestyle commitments'. The six-time Grand Slam champion said he was 'shocked' and 'embarrassed' when he was declared bankrupt on June 21 2017 over an unpaid loan of more than PS3million on his estate in Mallorca, Spain. The German national, who has lived in the UK since 2012, claimed he had co-operated with trustees tasked with securing his assets, even offering up his wedding ring, and relied on the advisers who managed his life. However, Becker, who was supported in court by his partner Ms de Carvalho Monteiro and eldest son, was found guilty of four charges under the Insolvency Act by a jury at Southwark Crown Court on April 8. They include removal of property, two counts of failing to disclose estate and concealing debt. Judge Deborah Taylor released Becker on conditional bail ahead of sentencing tomorrow, when he could face a jail sentence carrying a maximum term of seven years on each count. The jury heard Becker received PS950,000 from the sale of a Mercedes car dealership he owned in Germany, which was paid into a business account. Prosecutor Rebecca Chalkley said he used the account as a 'piggy bank' for personal expenses, including PS7,600 on children's school fees, almost PS1,000 at Harrods, and payments made to Ralph Lauren, Porsche, Ocado and a Chelsea children's club. He was found guilty of transferring PS356,000 to nine recipients, including the accounts of his ex-wife Barbara and estranged wife Sharlely 'Lilly' Becker, the mother of his fourth child. Becker also paid PS40,000 for an ankle operation at a private clinic and spent PS5,000 at a luxury golf resort in China, the court heard. He was also convicted of failing to declare a property in his home town of Leimen, hiding an PS700,000 bank loan on the house as well as 75,000 shares in tech firm Breaking Data Corp. But Becker was acquitted of a further 20 charges, including nine counts of failing to hand over trophies and medals from his tennis career. He told jurors he did not know the whereabouts of the memorabilia, including two of his three Wimbledon men's singles trophies, including the 1985 title that catapulted him to stardom, aged 17. The other prizes were his 1992 Olympic gold medal, Australian Open trophies from 1991 and 1996, the President's Cup from 1985 and 1989, his 1989 Davis Cup trophy and a Davis Cup gold coin which he won in 1988. Becker was cleared of failing to declare a second German property, as well as his interest in the PS2.5 million Chelsea flat occupied by his daughter Anna Ermakova, who was conceived during Becker's infamous sexual encounter with waitress Angela Ermakova at London restaurant Nobu in 1999. Giving evidence, he said he earned a 'vast amount' of money during his career, paying cash for a family home in Munich, a property in Miami, Florida, and the estate in Mallorca, which was worth about 50 million euros at the height of the property market. But Becker, who went on to coach current world number one tennis player Novak Djokovic, work as a TV sports commentator and act as a brand ambassador for firms including Puma, said his income 'reduced dramatically' following his retirement in 1999. He said he was involved in an 'expensive divorce' with ex-wife Barbara in 2001, involving high maintenance payments to their two sons, and had to support his daughter Anna and her mother, in a deal which included the Chelsea flat. Becker, who was resident in Monte Carlo and Switzerland before moving to the UK, said he had 'expensive lifestyle commitments,' including his PS22,000-a-month rented house in Wimbledon, south-west London. He also owed the Swiss authorities five million francs (about PS4 million) and separately just under one million euros (more than PS800,000) in liabilities over a conviction for tax evasion and attempted tax evasion in Germany in 2002. The court heard Becker's bankruptcy resulted from a PS3.85 million loan from private bank Arbuthnot Latham in 2013, and PS1.2million, with a 25 per cent interest rate, borrowed from British businessman John Caudwell, who founded Phones 4u, the following year. He said bad publicity had damaged 'brand Becker', meaning he struggled to make enough money to pay off his debts, while his QC Jonathan Laidlaw said at the time of his bankruptcy Becker was too 'trusting and reliant' on his advisers. Few spots stars have ever hit the height of Boris Becker's tennis careers - and none as young as the German ace. Born in Leimen, West Germany, in 1967, Becker, the son of an architect father and a Czech immigrant mother, was thrust into the world of tennis from a young age. His father founded a tennis centre in the town, where Becker honed his skills early on. By the age of 10, in 1977, he was a member of the junior team of the Baden Tennis Association. He went on to win the South German championship and the first German Youth Tennis Tournament.  After winning funding for training from the German Tennis Federation, he turned professional at 16 in 1984, winning the Tennis World Young Masters at the NEC in Birmingham in 1985, before claiming victory at Queens in June. Two weeks later, in July, aged 17, he entered Wimbledon as an unseeded player and took the tournament by storm, beating Kevin Curren by four sets in the final.  At just 17 years and 228 days old he became the youngest men's singles champion at SW19 - and immediately became a household name. The following year he defend his title, beating then world number one Ivan Lendl to secure back-to-back Wimbledon titles. He appeared in 77 finals and won 49 singles titles during his 16 years as a tennis pro. But by 1993, facing criticism over his marriage to wife Barbara and tax problems with the German government, had caused Becker to slide into a severe mid-career decline. In 1997, Becker lost to Sampras in the quarterfinals at Wimbledon. After that match, he vowed that he would never play at Wimbledon again. However he returned one more time to the prestigious west London tennis club, in 1999, this time losing in the fourth round to Patrick Rafter. Off the court, his personal troubles continued. He had to pay PS2.4million after he fathered a daughter, named Anna, with a Russian model while married to wife Barbara. That incident took place after he crashed out of Wimbledon to Rafter in 1999 and decided to retire from the sport, aged 31. Becker, in his 2003 autobiography, Stay A Moment Longer, revealed how he 'cried my eyes out' and felt the need to go out for a few beers with friends. However his then wife Barbara, seven months' pregnant with their second son, wanted him to stay at their hotel with her.  'She couldn't and wouldn't understand that she suddenly wasn't first in my priorities,' said Becker.  'I said, 'Just once more with the lads, Barbara, just once more to say farewell and then it's only you'. That didn't work. We rowed for two whole hours. Suddenly she was in pain and decided to check into hospital.; Becker said he told his wife to call him if the baby was really on the way, then hit the town. By 11pm he was at the bar in Mayfair's Nobu and spotted Russian model Angela Ermakowa. The pair had sex on the staircase in the London outpost.  The following February his secretary handed him a fax in his Munich office. It read: 'Dear Herr Becker, We met in Nobu in London. The result of that meeting is now eight months old.'  He later split from his first wife Barbara Feltus, a divorce which is estimated to have cost him more than PS15million, as well as their home in Miami.  Becker found a new post-tennis purpose soon after, joining the BBC for its annual coverage of Wimbledon - to great success. But his personal problems continued. He had a short engagement to Alessandra Meyer-Wolden in 2008, before announcing that he and Dutch model Sharlely 'Lilly' Kerssenberg would marry in 2009. After nine years of marriage, and a child, Becker's fourth, the pair split in 2018.  A year earlier, Becker had been declared bankrupt in June 2017 over an unpaid loan of more than PS3million on his estate in Mallorca, Spain. His former business partner, Hans-Dieter Cleven, also claimed that the former tennis ace owed him more than PS30million - though the case that was rejected by a Swiss court. Now Becker faces another bump in the road - perhaps the most serious yet - after being found guilty of four counts relating to the Insolvency Act earlier this month. He faces up to seven years in prison - with his freedom now left hanging in the balance ahead of his sentencing tomorrow.",
  "6d8778fad1ddeaace1c5c5e637bef546cb53b5ce5c702d817ab8a157": "A British Hollywood actress accused of sexually abusing a schoolgirl with her taekwondo 'master' husband vowed to burn their alleged victim's belongings when she said she no longer wanted to see the couple, a court heard today. Martial arts expert Zara Phythian, 36, from Mansfield, who starred in Marvel's Doctor Strange with Benedict Cumberbatch, is on trial accused of 14 charges of sexual activity with a child with her spouse Victor Marke, 59.  The couple arrived at Nottingham Crown Court today for the second day of their trial, where their alleged victim gave evidence for the first time. She claims they groomed her as a 13-year-old girl and filmed themselves abusing her after plying the victim with dark rum. The woman, who was a child at the time of the alleged offences, said that she finally told a friend 'her darkest secret' about the abuse when she was 18, and had later spoken to Zara on the phone, telling jurors: 'I said I am not coming back. Zara said: 'Don't come back, I'm burning all your stuff'.' Phythian, who starred in the 2016 Marvel film viewed as Cumberbatch's blockbuster breakthrough, is alleged to have targeted the teenager with Marke. The couple filmed most of the abuse in bid to recreate their favourite porn scenes, the prosecution say. The attacks are claimed to have happened between 2005 and 2008. Today their alleged victim tearfully told the trial how she finally revealed what she described as her 'darkest secret' years later when a police officer knocked on her mum's door to say another girl had claimed Marke had abused her, and asked 'if she knew anything'. At that time, the court has heard how Taekwondo black belt Zara was enjoying 'unprecedented personal and professional success' thanks to her acting career, including the role of 'Brunette Zealot' in Doctor Strange. Speaking from behind a screen, the girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she 'would never have come forward' and planned to 'die with my shame' - but had recently become a mother herself, and felt she had 'no option to speak my truth' in a bid to stop anyone else being targeted in the same way she claimed to have been.  'That was my deepest, darkest secret. I thought that if I was to say anything, then my family would hate me. At that time I really hated my mum. I got stuck because I had this secret and I could not tell her.' In an earlier videotaped interview played to the jury that the alleged victim gave to police, she told how the Markes 'preyed' upon her. She said: 'They saw the vulnerability in me and preyed on that, and saw my mum was struggling, and took advantage of that. I found it quite hard and they kind of instructed me through all of it (the sexual activity).' Referring to the alleged filming of the incidents, she added: 'All I can remember is he used to record. 'I don't know what he did with them. I never saw them again. I did not want to see them. I was ashamed. It was a power they had over me. 'I never knew how to get out of that situation. I could not see a way out.' The alleged victim went on to claim the Markes had 'made me leave college six months in', adding: 'They really ruined my education in a sense'. The court has previously heard Victor's marriage broke down around 2005 after he had an affair with Zara, who was herself a teenager at the time. He is also charged with four further allegations, all denied, of indecent assault on another teenage girl between 2002 and 2003. Nottingham Crown Court heard that alongside Phythian's acting career, the couple were sports coaches who 'commanded admiration and respect within the martial arts world'.  But prosecutor Ahmed Hossain QC said Marke, a taekwondo 'master', used his position of trust to 'satisfy his sexual urges' in targeting the girl - with his wife acting 'as part of that process'. The child also felt like she was being 'coached' by Phythian during the abuse, the court was told. Jurors were told that on the first occasion the victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was plied with rum at the couple's home before being 'dared' by Zara, 36, to perform a sex act on Victor after showing her how. After that, it was claimed the Marke abused the girl 'once or twice a month' for the next three years, and urged her 'not to tell anyone'.  Marke is also charged with four further allegations, all denied, of indecent assault on another teenage girl between 2002 and 2003.  Marke, 59, and Phythian, 36, - whose legal name is now Zara Marke - deny 14 charges of sexual activity with a child.  As well as being cast in Hollywood hit Doctor Strange as the character Brunette Zealot, the actress has also appeared in a string of other films under her stage name Zara Phythian, with her latest action movie Accident Man 2 due out this year.  Jurors were shown a video interview their alleged victim gave to police. In it, she described how she would stay at the Markes' then home in Arnold, Nottingham, where the pair would 'let her drink', even though she was just 13. It was there, she said, that the abuse began. She told officers: 'It was Captain Morgan's Dark Rum. My mum did not like me drinking. I was not allowed to drink. 'Zara asked me if I wanted to play a game of 'dare', and started [performing a sex act on] Victor. She asked me to do the same. 'Then he took it in turns to have sex with each of us. 'I just tried to copy Zara's reactions and emotions, the noises she was making. I had never received much attention from boys. I think I just liked the attention. It just went on from there.' The alleged victim, now in her late 20s, claimed the sexual activity continued 'once or twice a month' until she was 16 - with Victor Marke, 59, asking her to record him and his wife on some occasions, and filming her on others. She added: 'I knew it was wrong, but I did not know how to get out of the situation, or say anything. 'I just did whatever they asked me to do. They made it seem like I was some naughty kid and they were helping me out. I just felt like there was no way out. They told me not to say anything.' She estimated Marke, a coach in martial arts and Taekwondo at a very high level, had sex with her about 20 times on different occasions.   Phythian, who portrayed Brunette Zealot in the Marvel film, was 'at the height of her success,' said barrister, Francis McGrath, who is representing Marke, the film star's husband.  Mr McGrath made reference to Phythian's climb to fame as he cross-examined the woman who has claimed Marke repeatedly indecently assaulted her as a teenager. He said: 'Throughout 2016, you would be aware from national media and social media posts, she (Zara Marke) was enjoying unprecedented personal and professional success in a motion picture starring Benedict Cumberbatch.  'On December 4, 2016, at the height of her success, you made a complaint'. This led to a police video recording of her allegations two days later.  The woman told the court, 'they are not linked' - when it was suggested she went to police after 'Zara Phythian' - someone from her youth - was experiencing the unprecedented success referred to. The woman had told police she was groomed and sexually touched by Marke of Ravenshead. After she turned 16, he is alleged to have had sex with her. The victim said she decided it was the responsible thing to make a disclosure to police due to the job she was in.  She told the court she was dealing with two safeguarding cases at work, 'matters which were very tough to deal with and, me personally, was taking a toll on'.  After she felt she could not cope with 'not saying anything anymore', she decided to say something. The jury later heard claims that Zara had an intimate tattoo on her body. The victim told the court it was an 'Oriental symbol' that she believed meant 'paradise', adding: 'That's what she said to me.' James Varley QC, defending Zara, also said that the actress had been offered a role performing with Britain's Got Talent winners Diversity on their UK dance tour in 2010 - but was forced to turn it down because she was 'defending a (martial arts) world title in India'. He added: 'By this stage, Zara had become quite well known in the martial arts community. 'She had won two World Records for kicking stuff off people's heads, had done film stuff, and had won World Championships, and it was because of her fame in that community that she was invited to perform something martial-artsy in Diversity's Show. 'She is developing a media career.'  Marke faces four allegations, all denied, of historic indecent assault on another woman who was 15 at the time between 2002 and 2003.  He is also jointly charged with his wife, Phythian, of 14 denied allegations of sexual activity with a different woman who was a girl at the time. The trial continues.",
  "a17eeacd510cc197f847e1a1f38138f2e7d2ae193ff0941ab6183352": "A Labour frontbencher told a woman MP that they were a 'secret weapon' because men wanted to sleep with them, it was claimed today. The female politician - who wants to remain anonymous - was allegedly subjected to the lewd remark at an event in Westminster. The episode surfaced as claims that a Tory MP was seen watching porn on their phone in the Commons were referred for an independent investigation.   Cabinet members said the culprit should be stripped of the whip or even kicked out of the House if they the allegations are proven.  But former minister Caroline Nokes has accused the chief whip of kicking the issue 'into the long grass', and said the whip should have been suspended already.   Defence Secretary Ben Wallace also urged MPs to stay out of Parliament's 'poisonous' drinking dens amid growing uproar at sexism and sleaze at Westminster. Mr Wallace said the long hours and access to alcohol had been a problem for many years, and his advice to colleagues was 'finish your day's work and go home'. In the latest grim claims, a woman MP told BBC Wales that when someone praised her as a 'rising star' of her party at an event, the unnamed shadow cabinet minister intervened.  They apparently said she was a 'secret weapon' because 'women want to be her friend' and men wanted to sleep with her. 'She is a vote winner,' they reportedly added. Keir Starmer said: 'I'm deeply concerned to hear these suggestions and these allegations. 'There is a complaints procedure and I want everybody to have the confidence to use that complaints procedure because I would want to get to the bottom of this and do something about it.' A Labour spokeswoman said: 'The Labour Party takes all complaints extremely seriously.  'They are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures, and any appropriate action is taken.' It is understood that no complaint has been received, and BBC Wales said the woman did not want to be identified for fear of consequences.  Labour has recently introduced a new independent complaints procedure to boost confidence, and is encouraging people to come forward. In a round of interviews this morning, Mr Wallace said 'there's no place for pornography in any workplace' and said there needs to be a cultural change in Westminster. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I certainly think they should lose the whip.' He pointed to the handful of exclusive bars on the Parliamentary estate, where drinks are much cheaper than outside, with a pint of beer costing around PS3.60. Mr Wallace told Times Radio that there were 'fights', 'sexist comments' and 'propositions' in the bars.  'What I have witnessed is, what I think is the fundamental problem of Westminster, is the overall culture is that hundreds and hundreds of people (are) working long hours in a place with bars,' he said. 'And for some people, under lots of pressure for all sorts of reasons. And that... mix becomes poisonous.'  Mr Wallace said the problems had been 'going on for decades' and were 'not easy to fix'.  'I mean, my advice to any MP is actually avoid the bars, you know, finish a day's work and go home.  'But you know, that is part of the ultimate challenge around parliament that I think needs to be fixed.  'And you know, in the Armed Forces, I have a similar challenge, which is often in those high pressure environments where people mix and then alcohol is consumed, you end up in a place where people do things, either they regret, or things that is totally unacceptable.'  The Defence Secretary told Sky News: 'There is a range of allegations that go right across the House, go right across the parties. 'This is a problem, I think, about the overall culture of the House of Commons. 'It is late sitting, long nights with bars, and that very often leads, and it has done for decades, to behavioural challenges... 'I think it's really important that we think about ways to change the culture in the House of Commons.' Attorney General Suella Braverman told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour that if the allegation of an MP watching porn in Parliament is proven there should be a 'severe reprimand' including an opportunity to oust them from the Commons. 'I'm shocked and appalled... what would possess them? It is totally unacceptable,' she said. 'I am very glad that the chief whip has now referred it to the independent complaints and grievance process.' Ms Braverman went on: 'I think we would really need to see a situation where the whip would be removed. I am ashamed that this person is carrying the Conservative rosette. 'I think they really do need to be subject to a recall, and no longer holding their privileged position as a member of parliament.' Ms Braverman said while all the men she had worked with were 'respectful' there were MPs who behaved like 'animals'.  'There is however, a very small minority of men - and it is men - who fall short, and there are some bad apples who are out of order, who behave like animals and are bringing parliament into disrepute to be honest,' she said. 'I don't think we should be saying there is a pervasive culture. That is not my experience. There are certain individuals who are behaving in an unacceptable way.'   The Conservative Party's chief whip has ordered an official investigation into claims that an MP was watching porn on his mobile phone in the House of Commons Chamber. A spokesman said the matter would be referred to Parliament's independent complaints and grievance scheme (ICGS). 'Following allegations of inappropriate behaviour in the House of Commons the Chief Whip has asked that this matter be referred to the ICGS. 'Upon the conclusion of any ICGS investigation the Chief Whip will take appropriate action.'  Ms Nokes told PoliticsHome the referral amounted to 'kicking it into the long grass' and it would be 'months before anything is done'. 'It's not shouldering the burden of responsibility of dealing with it, and I think the Chiefs should have dealt with it immediately,' she said.  Sir Keir said the Conservative Party should 'take action now' against the MP. He said: 'I think it's very good that we've got an independent system and obviously that requires anonymity. 'This is an unusual case because the Tory Party knows who this individual is. 'I think that they should deal with it and deal with it sooner rather than later and take appropriate action. 'So, nothing wrong with the independent process, but I think the Tory Party, they know who this is, they should take action now.' Those reported to the body are given automatic anonymity, meaning the Tory MP's name will not be published while he is under investigation. Only witnesses are able to make complaints to the scheme. The body is said to be investigating at least 56 MPs - including three ministers and two shadow ministers - who have been accused of sexual misconduct. Two female MPs say they witnessed their colleague looking at adult images more than once.",
  "726264879fe82ff0406d0729fcf44bb1cb7599d1d8f2a18577b732cd": "Students at Durham University have been told to attend 'anti-racism training' after a row over journalist Rod Liddle.  The training is aimed at 'ensuring a safer community for people of colour'. But students have branded it 'anti-white indoctrination', 'divisive' and are refusing to attend as it clashes with exam revision.  It comes after Liddle, the controversial Spectator journalist, was invited to give a talk at South College, sparking protests from students who claimed he was 'racist'.  An email sent on Tuesday to undergraduates at John Snow College said training would be run by Durham's People of Colour Association (DPOCA), a student body, and would be 'mandatory'.  But after being contacted by the Daily Mail, the university said it was 'not a University or College initiative' and was 'at the discretion of individuals'. Rod Liddle's speech at the University of Durham has not been reported in full, but the contents of the speech have been reported by the university's student newspaper, the Palatinate. According to the newspaper, Liddle opened his Friday speech saying he was disappointed not to see any sex workers at the event. This was in reference to recent controversy surrounding safety training provided by Durham University to student sex workers.  Liddle then claimed that the left was going against 'science or pure facts,' saying 'a person with an X and a Y chromosome, that has a long, dangling penis, is scientifically a man, and that is pretty much, scientifically, the end of the story', according to the paper. He continued, on a different topic, saying: 'It is fairly easily proven that colonialism is not remotely the major cause of Africa's problems, just as it is very easy to prove that the educational underachievement of British people of Caribbean descent or African Americans is nothing to do with institutional or structural racism'.  Liddle also opined about the UK's forced adoption policy between 1945 and 1975. He said that attitudes now put woman, not children, first, adding that anger about the policy did not take into account the child's mental health and economic situation enough. He closed his speech with a message to the event's attendees about the importance of listening to, and doubting other people's opinions. The Palatinate reported that a dozen students walked out before the speech began, and several more during it. At the end, a very small number are reported to have applauded the speaker, and while it is protocol to rise for the high table as it leaves, nearly all students remaining in the hall stayed seated. Some shouted 'disgusting' and 'racist' at Liddle as he left the room.  It is understood students were vowing not to attend the sessions. Samantha Smith, a Durham student, said on Twitter: 'As a mixed race student, I refuse to take part in this anti-white indoctrination'.  Another called it 'divisive' and said 'students should be revising for exams instead'.  A DPOCA spokesman said: 'The intention of the workshop is to create a more inclusive, not divisive, culture on campus.'  A Durham University spokesman said: 'The provision of this training was not a University or College initiative, but was taken by the student-led JCR at John Snow College. 'The training is delivered by DPOCA, an association of Durham Students' Union. 'Anti-racism training can help to create a more respectful environment, but attendance is at the discretion of individual students.' DPOCA has in the past run events such as 'decolonise hiking', a walk around Durham for 'students of colour'. It has also been campaigning to 'decolonise the curriculum' and has promoted online the 'County Durham Palestine Solidarity Campaign'. College head Tim Luckhurst, who had invited Liddle, was temporarily barred from duties while an 'investigation' took place into his conduct. He was allowed to keep his job, but the university vowed to be more 'inclusive' and effect a 'culture change' following the incident. Footage emerged after Liddle's talk of Professor Luckhurst and his wife Dorothy Luckhurst talking to students in a bid to calm them down. They appeared to be helping them understand universities are supposed to be bastions of free speech. The youths stood with their mouths wide open as Professor Luckhurst spoke before his wife interrupted him. She asked: 'What are you frightened of you silly... what are you frightened of?' One of the students replied: 'What do you mean?' The rest of their exchange was inaudible but Mrs Luckhurst went on to repeat the word 'a***'. Mrs Luckhurst had explained the video left out the context of the chat in which the vicious students hurled insults at the couple. She said the 'baying' mob called her a 'b***h' and left her intimidated and frightened as they swarmed around them. After the event, Liddle slammed the university for its 'despicable' treatment of Professor Luckhurst and said they should 'reinstate him immediately to all his duties'. He also called for bosses to say sorry to him for 'vilifying' his speech which addressed trans issues, women's rights and institutional racism to 'appease jabbering infants' and said they should reimburse his PS150 travel expenses. It came after a group of Left-wing students staged a protest at South College calling for the professor to apologise for his wife's comments to them or quit. The baying activists gathered on a green with placards reading 'mansplain, manipulate, manwife' and 'we're queer, we're here'. Professor Luckhurst had angered them by shouting 'pathetic' when students staged a walk-out during Mr Liddle's talk - although he later apologised. Liddle told GB News last year: 'Let's start with what Durham University should do. They've behaved despicably, far worse than the students have behaved. 'I expected that from the students, I expected that from some of them. What you don't expect is the kind of double think which Durham University has indulged in. 'Firstly by saying that they agree with freedom of speech, then by saying except if it's something we don't agree with, which the Labour Party on campus doesn't agree with, then they don't agree with it. 'Then most importantly of all you might argue, scapegoating poor Tim Luckhurst who asked me to come along in good faith having cleared it with the university authorities having told them what was happening in advance. 'They have now decided because they've got to appease these jabbering infants they've decided they've got to do something and so a hugely distinguished, reputable and incredibly competent journalist and professor is left hanging out to dry. 'And so what they should do now, immediately, is number one, decide whether they believe in free speech or not. 'Number two, write a grovelling apology to Professor Luckhurst, reinstating him immediately to all his duties, and call off this fatuous investigation... 'And accept that he invited me here in good faith.  'And thirdly, what they should do after that is write me a letter of apology and explain to me they were wrong to have vilified me in their comments about this whole affair and they might be better off in future rather than teaching extra courses to their students in how to become prostitutes, a course in good manners might not come amiss. 'And they can also forward me 150 quid for my travel expenses because I came there free of charge with a wish to do the right thing to give something to public service, all that palaver.' He added: 'So they can apologise and reimburse my travel expenses and after that, I'll be happy.'",
  "9a2b0ea8e42e8a501c596718a51da0529219041dabdd8cadb28172bb": "Prince Andrew should voluntarily renounce his Duke of York title say councillors in the city after they voted unanimously to removed his Freedom of the City of York in the wake of his settled sexual abuse case.  The prince was branded 'an utter disgrace' during the extraordinary meeting to debate his Freedom of the City honour, which was awarded to him in 1987. After discussing the motion for around half an hour, councillors unanimously voted to strip him of the title. His continued clinging to the title Duke of York was described as as 'stain' on the city and councillors are now calling on the Queen, Palace or government to step in and strip him of the title if he refuses 'to do the right thing' and resign.  The council also noted objections from the public calling for the prince be banned from attending horse racing events in the city. Another said he should be referred to as 'Andrew Windsor' in the future. Andrew had been warned in advance that he would be losing the freedom of the city, an honour bestowed on him on February 23, 1987, as a wedding gift to Sarah Ferguson. He is the first person ever to have the Freedom of the City removed, councillors were told. There were two formal abstentions - from the Lord Mayor and Lord Mayor elect. Lib Dem Darryl Smalley, City of York Council's executive member for culture, leisure & communities proposed the motion and says he should also now lose the Duke of York title. He said tonight: 'The Honorary Freedom of York is the highest honour we, as a city, can bestow on those who represent the very best of York. The honour is held by many notable and accomplished people who carry it with pride and responsibly. 'Having been stripped of his military roles and royal patronages by the Queen, we believe that it is right to remove all links that Prince Andrew still has with our great city. 'I was pleased to see councillors of all parties support this motion and make it clear that it is no longer appropriate for Prince Andrew to represent York and its residents. 'The removal of this honorary title sends the right message that we as a city stand with victims of abuse. The next logical step is now for Prince Andrew to do the right thing and relinquish his Duke of York title. 'If he fails to do so, the Government and Buckingham Palace must step in to remove his title to finally end Prince Andrew's connection to York.' It follows a slew of authorities, institutions, schools and even golf clubs, which have all sought to distance themselves from the disgraced duke since he settled his civil case with Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking victim Virginia Giuffre.  In the wake of the case, which was settled in February, the 62-year-old was also stripped of his military roles and royal patronages and was told he would no longer be known as 'His Royal Highness'.  Both Buckingham Palace and a spokesperson for the Duke of York declined to comment. York City Council considered the motion: 'The Council resolves that, pursuant to Section 249 of the Local Government Act 1972, the City of York Council withdraws the Honorary Freeman of the City status from the Duke of York which was conferred upon him in 1987.'  The meeting at York Race Course started with an impassioned plea from York resident Gwen Swinburn, who is well known for her clashes with the council. She said: 'This motion could not have been any weaker. Mr Andrew Windsor is an utter disgrace. He brings shame and reputational damage everywhere he goes including to our city. 'The motion to withdraw his status goes nowhere near far enough. He needs to be declared persona non grata in York.' 'As we all know, he loves his horse racing so please agree to write to the race course asking he never be invited here,' she continued. 'That man casts a long shadow and our Queen has removed almost all titles and a responsibilities except his dukedom which stains this city. We need to do more than the easy bit, which is to remove his freedom.' Councillor Aisling Musson, for York Labour Group, added: 'This title damages the reputation of our city. We owe it to the people of York, in particular those affected by sexual violence, abuse or human trafficking. 'Our first duty is not to our reputation but their well-being and protection and remove this stain of association on our city which I am sure has weighed heavily on their minds - and may even have brought up pain and trauma they have worked hard to move past from.' Councillor Mark Warters added: 'While it is purely a symbolic act it does send a very strong signal from this city.' Councillor Martin Rolley, for the Tory Group, is also calling for a new watchdog awards sub committee to be set up to vet future suggestions for Freeman. York has a long history of freemen dating back to 1272. Freemen can claim their rights through patronage as far back as their great-great-grandparent. Once they are sworn in, freemen can join the Gild of Freemen who take an interest in the affairs of the city. New admissions are made every year. Back then, freemen were given control of city trade, city strays and rights of pasture. They were also given roles in running the city.  However, in modern times, they have no privileges in the city. You can still claim Freemanship through 'hereditary right' but it is also now possible to just apply for the tile by filling out an application form.   He added: 'I would like to challenge the council. The title dates back many many years. 'We want to ensure nobody receives a freedom of the city award as a result of a right of birth or standing in their community other than earned in the community.' Councillor Dave Taylor added: 'The motion has been very carefully worded to avoid any lurid allegations which would be difficult if not impossible to substantiate. 'However, I subscribe to the point of view that the Duke of York has shown a dreadful lack of judgment in his friendships with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. 'I hope in the future the Monarch might appoint the Princess Beatrice to be Duchess of York. In contrast to his father, she is personable, intelligent and does her homework and reads her briefing paper when visiting the city of York.' Councillor Denise Craghill, for the Green Group, said: 'It is highly inappropriate Andrew should retain the freedom of the city. 'It is highly inconsistent what we stand for as a city and would like the Palace and Government to take action to remove his title as Duke of York.' The Duke is the first VIP to be stripped of his Freeman status since Jimmy Savile, who had his taken by Scarborough Council in 2011.  The meeting in York had been scheduled to take place virtually last month but the plug was pulled just two hours before it was due to start following objections from Labour councillors.  The decision to cancel the initial meeting caused fury among councillors, but York Council's Lib Dem Group said the vote would go ahead on the same motion in April.  The spokesman said: 'The votes taken remotely would have been seen as recommendations and would have had to go to the Chief Operating Officer to be confirmed as decisions. 'Virtual meetings took place during Covid when the COO agreed with all the recommendations. It is purely because the agenda item on this meeting was very, very political. 'It was felt it would be better to hold it safely and properly in person once members were ready and healthy enough to attend. 'Quite a few councillors had recently tested positive for Covid and the real concern was many of them were vulnerable.'  Ahead of the cancelled meeting last month, Darryl Smalley, a Liberal Democrat councillor for York City, told the Independent: 'York's unique connection to the crown and the monarch is an important part of our city's legacy and history.   'However, as a council and city, we stand with victims of sexual abuse and are doing all we can to end violence against women and girls locally.  'As such, it is inappropriate that Prince Andrew retains his ambassadorial title that is intrinsically linked to our city.'  Mr Smalley had previously called on Prince Andrew to be stripped of his title. A survey by York's daily newspaper The Press found that 88 per cent of its readers want to see the prince's Duke of York honours taken away from him.   Phil Pinder, a retailer in the famous cathedral city told The York Press in February: 'York deserves better. He has been stripped of his royal duties; he has done a settlement out of court ending the prospect of any kind of legal clearing of his name so the only option is for him to permanently step down as the Duke of York as well. 'York deserves another royal to represent it instead.' He suggested the 'controversial' choice of Prince Harry, who lives in the US and holds the Duke of Sussex title.  There are also multiple petitions to remove the Duke of York honour from Prince Andrew.  One with 1,500 signatories says: 'Not only has 'Prince' Andrew demonstrated a lack of morals, lack of humanity and lack of judgement by protracted fraternising with Jeffrey Epstein, his recent interview confirms he lacks the ability to reflect, show insight and learn.  'Most importantly, it reveals a total lack of caring for others. 'These are not Yorkshire values. Having him associated with such a proud, fair and straight talking county is contradictory and embarrassing. Remove the title.'  Prince Andrew made his first public appearance since he withdrew from public life following his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was found guilty in 2021 of child sex trafficking, at the service for his father Prince Philip. The shamed royal insisted on accompanying the Queen from Windsor Castle to the thanksgiving event at Westminster Abbey. But to the shock of many in the congregation he then escorted his mother all the way to her front-row position - in full view of the live broadcast cameras. It had been expected that the Dean of Westminster would take the Queen to her seat, with Andrew behind. It was claimed the Queen 'personally paid PS2m to Virginia Roberts's charity' as part of Andrew's PS12m settlement. 'Stipulation of Dismissal' documents were filed with a court on March 8, with lawyers on both sides calling for the legal action to be dismissed, indicating the settlement has been paid. As the order was published, the Treasury confirmed no taxpayer funds were used for either the payment to Virginia Roberts or for the Duke of York's legal fees. A freedom of information request asked whether any money from the Sovereign Grant to the Royal Family or any other government money was used. The Treasury insisted: 'No public money has been used to pay legal or settlement fees.' The joint order filed with the New York court said each party would pay their own costs and fees.  There were reports the Queen or even Prince Charles contributed to the settlement by paying it or loaning him the money until the sale goes through of a PS17million Swiss ski chalet he owns with ex-wife, Sarah, Duchess of York. Mrs Roberts had sued Andrew for alleged sexual abuse. She claimed he had sex with her when she was 17 after he was trafficked by his friend, the late billionaire paedophile Epstein. The duke will make a 'substantial donation' to a charity for sex abuse victims set up by Mrs Roberts, now a 38-year-old mother-of-three. He said he now regrets his association with Epstein. Andrew, who was forced to step down from royal duties and public life as a result of the scandal, previously claimed he had no recollection of meeting Mrs Roberts and has always strongly denied her allegations. He agreed to the settlement in February.   A slew of authorities, institutions, schools and even golf clubs, have all sought to distance themselves from the disgraced duke since he settled his civil case with Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking victim Virginia Roberts.  In the wake of the case, which was settled in February, the 62-year-old was also stripped of his military roles and royal patronages and was told he would no longer be known as 'His Royal Highness'.
