  "27c56c943db3f0db4ef05c23da68b1f9a20d8ced7df6cf3ab0d058f8": "A prison governor who had 'intimate liaison' with an inmate and sent him messages calling him 'babe' has been jailed for eight months. Married Victoria Laithwaite, 47, was caught sending prisoner James Chalmers, 30, messages which suggested a relationship between the pair while he was banged up. She was working as head of safer custody and equalities when the texts were discovered on a mobile phone found inside the prisoner's cell at HMP Onley. A court heard in one exchange she said 'I thought you'd ditched me' while in another she wrote: 'I was thinking all sorts babe'. A photograph of Laithwaite was also found saved on the phone discovered inside Chalmers' cell. The sentencing judge told Laithwaite that her offence was aggravated by her 'serious breach of trust'  in her role as a prison governor - which included responsibility for ensuring the support of the most vulnerable inmates. Her defence lawyer said she was aware she has 'destroyed her life' and put her family 'through hell' because of her 'foolishness'. Laithwaite, whose husband also works at the category C jail in Northamptonshire, was arrested following the discovery of the phone on April 7 last year. She went on to plead guilty to an offence under Section 44 of the Serious Crime Act 2007 of engaging in communications with an illicit mobile. Today Laithwaite, of Coventry, was jailed for eight months at Northampton Crown Court while Chalmers was caged for 24 months. Sentencing, Her Honour Judge Adrienne Lucking said: 'You had been employed at HMP Onley with particular responsibility for vulnerable prisoners. 'You've been in HMP service for over 20 years and had in 2017 passed your exams to attain your grade of governor. 'The training and requirements for the standard of conduct for governors would have been very clear in your mind. 'Your offence is aggravated by your serious breach of trust, such conduct undermines the safety and good order of Her Majesty's prisons. 'Your culpability was high. Because of the position you are in the only punishment in this case is imprisonment. 'James Chalmers, at the time of these offences you were serving a sentence of two years nine months imprisonment. 'On the 7th April 2021, two mobile phones, one memory stick and four sim cards were recovered from James Chalmers' phone. 'One phone had sent and received messages to Victoria Laithwaite's phone. On the 4th and 5th of April an image of Mrs Laithwaite was sent and saved. 'It was a highly inappropriate relationship that was clear from the messages recovered.' Prosecutor Sinjin Bulbring earlier told the court the pair were caught after intelligence was received they had been messaging each other at the prison. He added: 'The nature of the messages is suggestive of a relationship between the two. 'For example, in response to a message from Chalmers, Laithwaite wrote: 'Yeah but I was worried when I didn't hear from you. Thought you'd ditched me. If that's the case, please just say it, I'd rather know.' 'With a response she then wrote: 'I haven't heard from you in two days, I was thinking all sorts babe.' with a kiss at the end. 'Later on the same day, she wrote: 'Your mum has been worried, too, can you message her. Can you message me on the other phone, I need to talk to you x.' 'There was also a saved image which was an image of Laithwaite. In interview she answered no comment to all questions in regards to a relationship with Chalmers. 'In interview, Chalmers denied the items found in his room were his. He admitted that he had used the phones to call his family and denied ever contacting Laithwaite.' Sarah Mahmud, defending Laithwaite, said: 'She appears before you deeply ashamed, utterly embarrassed and completely regretful. 'She is under no illusions of the severity of the offence. Committing this offence, she has single-handily destroyed her life, the life of her husband and her children. 'There is no question about it, she has put her family through hell. 'Both Mrs Laithwaite and her family have been put through utter turmoil because of her foolishness. 'She was relied upon very heavily by a number of very complex prisoners, including Mr Chalmers. She developed a rapport with Mr Chalmers, initially to help him. 'There were messages sent between the two parties but ultimately only two phone calls. 'Those two phone calls were attempted phone calls without duration. The messages were only over a finite amount of time. 'Mrs Laithwaite has said that there is no excuse. 'This was a mere blip in an otherwise unblemished career. There was not a physical relationship. 'There had been a breakdown in their marriage, to a point where they thought they could not return from. 'It is also worth noting that Mr Laithwaite has worked at HMP Onley. 'He has had to go into work every day knowing that people are talking about this. 'This is a lady that has lived her life faultlessly where she has sought to help others but she has fallen down the wrong path.' The court heard Chalmers has 19 court appearances for 44 offences including a variety of thefts, possession of drugs, driving offences and criminal damage. He pleaded guilty to transmitting and receiving images through electronic communications inside HMP Onley. Sarah Allen, defending, Chalmers, said: 'It is accepted that there was a degree of intimacy between them. This liaison started. 'He had served half of the sentence when the incident happened. He was released and then arrested. 'It's a matter of deep personal regret to him, a matter that he now wishes had never happened. 'This was a very short-lived matter that has come to an end.' Detective Inspector Dan Evans, of East Midlands Special Operations Unit, said Laithwaite had abused the position of trust and responsibility with the prison. He said: 'Laithwaite was a senior figure within the Prison Service, a public servant expected to behave to the highest standards. 'But this was serious misconduct on her part and only serves to erode confidence in the service as well as potentially undermine the complete security and good order needed to run a prison. 'Prisons are for rehabilitation, yet she willingly encouraged a prisoner to commit an offence, something which flies in the face of that. 'Illicit communications have the potential to seriously undermine order in a prison. 'This was a complex investigation, but working in partnership with colleagues in the Prison Service, I'm pleased we have rooted out a corrupt senior prison officer.'",
  "2f22a73bca8981483f8301f102ab87d1574ed919f877d50c02c62df4": "The town where The Only Way is Essex is filmed is at the centre of a trans rights row - after a PS7million children's play area was fitted with gender-neutral toilets. New facilities in King George's Playing Fields in Brentwood were opened by the Mayor, Councillor Olivia Sanders, in March to much fanfare. But joy over a new pavillion building, complete with soft play and sensory room is rapidly turned to disgust over the council's choice of lavatories. A few steps away from a children's ball pit are eight gender-neutral toilets that are the centre of parental storm. The PS1.99 stainless steel badges show merged symbols for a man and woman, with the design appearing to show them holding hands. One mother told MailOnline: 'Anyone can use these toilets really because they are public conveniences, but people have gone mad about it. 'One father told me it ran the risk of being a perverts' paradise because they were gender neutral. 'I am not sure exactly why they have to be unisex - why couldn't they have done half of them for men and half of them for women, with maybe two gender-neutral? 'How many gender-neutral children does the council think are going to be using the soft play ball pit?'  Another posted online: 'I don't like the idea of mixed toilets. 'Lots of kids go to the parks there with their friends, no parents with them, where's the safety in that? 'Too many perverts hanging around parks and toilets.'  One woman - who said she was a safeguarding officer - was also against the gender-neutral facilities. She declared: 'I have a problem with the mixed toilets. 'They are not in the best interests of children.' The guidance says that toilets can be legally limited to men and women with separate gender-neutral facilities as long as trans people are taken into account. This is explained through two examples.  One is a small cafe with limited space and facilities for public use which has separate lockable, self-contained male and female toilets with hand basins in single units.  The EHRC says that to ensure they are fully inclusive, and to make the most effective use of the available facilities, the cafe could decide to make them all gender neutral. A second example is a community centre which has separate male and female toilets. The centre could conduct a survey in which some service users say that they would not use the centre if the toilets were open to members of the opposite biological sex, for reasons of privacy and dignity or because of their religious belief.  It decides to introduce an additional gender-neutral toilet, and puts up signs telling all users that they may use either the toilet for their biological sex or to use the gender neutral toilet. It is not clear what consultation with the public was done over the unisex loos.  Last week female students at the University of Plymouth have been told not to confront anyone they suspect of posing as a woman in their toilets - and instead 'protect them from harm'. Signs in both male and female lavatories around its buildings contain the warning posters branded with the pink, blue and white strips of the trans flag. Critics have branded the move 'repellent gaslighting' and questioned why a third toilet space could not be created instead It comes amid fierce debate over the issue of trans women in female spaces, such as hospital wards, and whether they should be allowed to compete in women's sports. There are also fears predatory sex offenders could pose as trans women to gain access to female loos. It also comes weeks after the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said service providers wishing to limit services to a single sex are legally able to do so, provided the reasons are justified and proportionate. The ruling means it is legal for a gym to limit communal changing rooms to a single sex, as long as a gender neutral changing room is also provided for trans people.  Brentwood Borough Council claimed it had made the toilets gender-neutral to make it easier for parents to accompany their children to the loo.      A spokesperson told MailOnline: 'The new toilet facilities in the Pavilion at King George's Playing Fields are self-contained individual toilet cubicles. 'This makes it easier for parents to accompany their children of the opposite sex to the bathroom and also reduces waiting times as you only need to wait until a cubicle is free.'",
  "35928d213eb92cf981038290aa6482d15129f5cadf3f11f472f72b55": "No migrants have arrived in small boats across the English Channel for nearly ten days in what is being claimed as an early victory for the Government's new scheme for sending asylum seekers to Rwanda. The last migrants to arrive at Dover in Kent were a total of 263 across seven small boats on April 19 - and Ministry of Justice data has revealed not a single adult or child has made it across since, up to and including yesterday. It also comes amid a new strategy to deal with Channel migrants launched on April 14 which saw the military take charge of attempts to control crossings with a joint task force drawn from the Navy, Army and Air Force in Kent. Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen said today that the drop to zero was evidence that Home Secretary Priti Patel's scheme, which will see asylum seekers sent 4,000 miles to claim refugee status from Rwanda, is 'working already'. The controversial agreement with the East African nation, which will see it receive asylum seekers deemed by the UK to have arrived 'illegally' and therefore inadmissible under new immigration rules, was signed on April 14. Mr Bridgen, the MP for North West Leicestershire, tweeted: 'Priti's migrant policy is working already. No illegal migrant crossing for a week and no income for people traffickers, freeing up civil servants to work on Ukrainian evacuees. We should offer the illegal migrants already here the option of returning to France or going to Rwanda.' But former Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage told GB News: 'There are some saying Rwanda is working, it's a success because virtually no migrants have come now for the last six or seven days. Believe you me, I know this subject. 'That is nothing to do with the prospect of being shipped off to Rwanda. It's because there has been a persistent, strong, north-easterly wind in the English Channel. When it gets calm again, the boats will continue to come.' Up to 300 military servicemen, Navy ships and surveillance drones are being deployed to the Channel after the Armed Forces took control with the Navy assuming Border Force's responsibility for intercepting migrant boats. An RAF Wildcat helicopter is now the key military asset in the air and is being used to carry out a final 'sweep' of the Channel at the end of each day to ensure all migrants - and their dinghies - have been recovered. Home Secretary Priti Patel is facing High Court challenges over controversial plans to send asylum seekers to Rwanda. The charity Freedom From Torture, which supports survivors of torture who are often asylum seekers and refugees, wrote to the Home Office yesterday requesting further information, with a view to bringing a High Court claim over the policy. The first step towards another challenge, from charities Detention Action and Care4Calais - and the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union which represents the majority of Border Force staff, was taken on Tuesday when they sent a pre-action letter to the Home Office. A letter from Freedom From Torture's legal representatives, Leigh Day, says that, while a memorandum of understanding between the UK and Rwanda has been published, information about the policy has not been made publicly available. It also says the charity has 'serious concerns' about the policy and in due course plans to bring a judicial review. The charity is asking for any document which sets out the policy of relocating asylum seekers to Rwanda, any guidance or rules provided to Home Office staff or other UK officials, any documents relating to co-operation with Rwanda, and any equality impact or risk assessments carried out in relation to the policy. The letter requests that any response is sent by 4pm on May 4, and the charity plans to crowdfund to cover legal costs of the case. Meanwhile, representatives for Detention Action, Care4Calais and the PCS have sent a letter which challenges 'the Home Secretary's failure to disclose the criteria dictating which people seeking asylum will be transferred by force to East Africa and which will remain in the UK', according to a joint press release. Those groups are also crowdfunding to cover the costs of the possible legal action and are represented by Duncan Lewis Solicitors. Freedom From Torture, the PCS and Care4Calais were involved in a challenge due to be heard next week against the Home Secretary over plans to 'push back' migrants in boats crossing the Channel, but the planned policy was withdrawn on Sunday.  The helicopter is being aided by RAF drones operated out of Lydd Airport in Kent. Soldiers and airmen are also now being based at Dover to help UK Border Force staff with initial processing, and the military are able to issue directions to civilian staff of the UK Border Force, whose ships are remaining part of the Channel taskforce. Seven ships including HMS Tyne, plus smaller boats and a helicopter are being made available to patrol the sea and coastline, so Border Force staff can be freed up for processing migrants once they arrive on land. More than 6,500 migrants are thought to have arrived in the UK this year so far after crossing the Channel. In 2021 some 28,526 migrants reached UK shores aboard dinghies and small boats - up from 8,417 in 2020. The total number of migrants arriving so far this month has been 2,143 across 58 small boats, although the final day of arrivals to the present date was on April 19 when 263 were intercepted across seven small boats.   In March this year, 3,066 people made the crossing. That was nearly four times the amount recorded for the same month in 2021 (831) and more than 16 times the amount for 2020 (187). It was also the fourth highest monthly total recorded since the start of 2020, behind July (3,510), September (4,652) and November (6,869) last year. The figures for April 2022 mean the total number of migrants to arrive so far this year is 6,693 across 204 boats. Some 1,425 of these had made it across since the Royal Navy took over control of migrant operations in the Channel on April 14. Earlier this month,  the UK's former Border Force chief Tony Smith told the Daily Mail that more than 100,000 Channel migrants will reach Britain this year. Backing the Government's asylum deal with Rwanda, Mr Smith said: 'There comes a point where we need to get a grip of our border and stop the boats. 'The numbers are going up, a fourfold increase already this year - 28,500 last year,' he added. 'That's going to be over 100,000 this year just by migrant boats alone.' Mr Smith's prediction would be nearly 12 times the level seen in 2020, 54 times that of 2019 and more than 300 times that in 2018. In January, it emerged that the Home Office had produced official papers warning that 65,000 migrants could cross this year.  Meanwhile the Archbishop of Canterbury again waded into the row over the Government's Rwanda plan yesterday. The Most Rev Justin Welby said there were serious 'ethical questions' about using 'deterrence' to stop asylum seekers reaching the UK. 'The Church of England is not a passive observer of migration policy,' he wrote in the Daily Telegraph. 'Some of my fellow bishops, clergy and worshippers came to the UK escaping persecution or conflict. 'We welcome and serve asylum seekers at every level of society - from providing housing, food banks, social support and friendship, to scrutinising legislation in the Lords.

We partner with the Government to settle refugees from Syria, Afghanistan and Ukraine ... government and Church are not the same, but we must surely all want to put humanity and fairness at the heart of our asylum system.' The new immigration policy will see asylum seekers who cross the Channel sent for processing in Rwanda, where they will have the right to apply to live. The Archbishop previously said the policy would not stand up to the scrutiny of God, prompting Boris Johnson to accuse him of being 'less vociferous' in his condemnation of Putin than he was in his attack on the policy.

Home Secretary Priti Patel has said the deal is about trying to 'empower' asylum seekers. 'It's always been a partnership based on resettlement, rebuilding lives,' she added.  In a speech earlier this month outlining the Rwanda agreement, Ms Patel said: 'The British people are fair and generous when it comes to helping those in need, but the persistent circumventing of our laws and immigration rules and the reality of a system that is open to gaming and criminal exploitation has eroded public support for Britain's asylum system and those that genuinely need access to it. 'Putting evil people smugglers out of business is a moral imperative. It requires us to use every tool at our disposal - and also to find new solutions. That is why today's migration and economic development partnership with Rwanda is such a major milestone. 'This agreement fully complies with all international and national law, and as part of this ground-breaking agreement, the UK is making a substantial investment in the economic development of Rwanda.' And a Home Office spokesman told MailOnline today: 'This world-leading Migration and Economic Development Partnership will overhaul our broken asylum system, which is currently costing the UK taxpayer PS1.5billion a year - the highest amount in two decades. 'It means those arriving dangerously, illegally or unnecessarily can be relocated to have their asylum claims considered and, if recognised as refugees, build their lives there. 'There is nothing in the UN Refugee Convention which prevents removal to a safe country. Under this agreement, Rwanda will process claims in accordance with national and international human rights laws.'",

Richard Eden, diary editor at the Daily Mail, says that they should just 'stay away'. 'I really get the impression that Harry and Meghan are loving all the speculation about whether they'll come for the Jubilee or not. What should be the wonderful celebrations of the Queen's amazing long reign, instead it's sort of become this saga or will-they-won't-they-come? Who cares? Just stay away, honestly,' he tells our royal talk show Palace Confidential. 'They want us to indulge in this speculation as long as possible.' Rebecca English, the Mail's royal editor, believes that Harry's row with the so-called men in grey suits is more dangerous than it might first appear. 'Prince Harry has built up such a wall of resentment and hatred against these people, I suspect it will always be a stumbling block when it comes to repairing his relationships with family members,' she says. 'Because he has such a great distrust and dislike for the people around them.' Once again these rows hurt the Queen on what should be a year of celebration for Her Majesty, argues the Daily Mail's Editor at Large, Richard Kay. 'I think it's tragic for her. The last thing she wants are these ongoing, bitter rows with her own grandchildren and the family,' he tells the programme. 'They had so much trouble in the 1990s which they had hoped they had put behind them, but this is somehow even worse and it must be enormously difficult for her and quite despairing.' Plus our experts look at whether Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie could be planning a royal comeback and why, and examine some of the claims made in two new headline-grabbing books on the royals - the portrait that Tina Brown paints of Prince Harry in The Palace Papers, while in William At 40, Robert Jobson examines how Megxit might have had a positive effect: bringing Prince Charles closer to Prince William.",
  "ddd19f973917a508b561779b1188bbf5b359557e95a3ab7d0cc464be": "Lingerie tycoon Michelle Mone's home has been raided by police investigating a firm for PS203 million of Covid PPE government contracts, it has been claimed. Tory peer Lady Mone, 50, is believed to have been present at an address that was searched by officers from the National Crime Agency, who raided homes and offices in London and the Isle of Man.  Lady Mone has a PS25million estate on the Isle of Man, as well as a home in Belgravia. It is unclear which address police visited.  They are said to have been searching for documents that could assist an inquiry into suspected fraud offences. No arrests are believed to have been made.  Lady Mone, from Glasgow, has denied any involvement with a company called PPE Medpro, which was given government contracts along with another firm.  However, it was revealed that she referred PPE Medpro to the officer of fellow Tory peer Theodore Agnew, who at the time was a Cabinet Officer minister responsible for the procurement of PPE. The NCA is currently investigating the award of contracts for supplying surgical gowns and masks to the NHS.  PPE Medpro appeared on the 'VIP Lane' list of companies given greater chances of a PPE contract. It was added to the list by Lord Agnew's office.  The firm, which is based in the Isle of Man, was formed in May 2020.  A few weeks later, it was given a contract to supply 25 million sterile gowns and masks. Lady Mone was linked to the company by the Guardian, however, she made clear she has no role in the company.  In January it emerged she had been referred to the House of Lords Commissioners for Standards. Labour peer George Foulkes said Lady Mone had failed to fully disclose her business interests in PPE Medpro and asked the commissioners to investigate whether she had breached the rules against lobbying when she referred the firm to the Government. Lady Mone has repeatedly denied any association with the company, which she recommended to the Cabinet Office as a potential supplier in May 2020. Although she has no actual formal connections with the company, her denials have come under scrutiny thanks to publicly documented connections between Anthony Page, PPE Medpro's owner, and businesses run by Lady Mone and her husband, Isle of Man-based billionaire Doug Barrowman. Lingerie tycoon Michelle Mone was born in 1971 and grew up in Glasgow's East End, leaving school with no qualifications aged 15 before finding work as a model. After running a sales and marketing team for the Labatt's brewing firm, she decided to create a range of support bras after the idea came to her while wearing an uncomfortable bra during a dinner party. Lady Mone founded MJM International with her then-husband Michael Mone in November 1996, and three years of research, design, and development resulted in the patented Ultimo bra. In August 1999, a month after having her third child, she launched Ultimo at the Selfridges department store in London, which sold the pre-launch estimate of six weeks of stock within 24 hours. The business grew rapidly and in 2010 she earned an OBE from the Queen for her contribution to business. But she sold 80 per cent of Ultimo in 2014, one year after announcing she had left the company following a breakdown in her marriage. Lady Mone was nicknamed 'Baroness Bra' after being elevated to the House of Lords in 2015, where her official title is Baroness Mone of Mayfair. To celebrate her 50th birthday, she decided to host five parties - one for each decade of her life - with her new husband billionaire tech tycoon Doug Barrowman, 55.    Lady Mone is being investigated under several sections of the Lords' code of conduct, including a section saying peers 'must never accept or agree to accept any financial inducement as an incentive or reward for exercising parliamentary influence'.  She is also being investigated under as section of the code saying peers 'must not seek by parliamentary means to confer exclusive benefit on an outside body or person (a) in which he or she has a financial interest (including by way of salary, fees, shareholding or other arrangement) or (b) in return for payment or reward'.  Lord Foulkes said Lady Mone had failed to fully disclose her business interests in PPE Medpro and asked the commissioners to investigate whether she had breached the rules against lobbying when she referred the firm to the Government. Mr Page, the sole owner of PPE Medpro, is a wealth management expert who works for Barrowman's Knox House Trust, part of the Knox Group of companies based on the Isle of Man, where Lady Mone and her husband live on a PS25 million estate. In December The Mail on Sunday revealed Mr Page is the director of a firm that owns a luxury yacht, called Lady M, on which Lady Mone sailed around the Adriatic last summer. Mr Page is also the majority shareholder of Lady Mone's new business venture Neo Space, which operates spaces for rent in Aberdeen.  Lady Mone founded lingerie brand Ultimo through parent company MJM International in 1996. She was made a life peer by David Cameron in 2015. Millions of the medical gowns bought by the NHS from PPE Medpro were never even used. At the time they had to reach the British Standard for the sterilisation of medical devices or what was called a 'technical equivalent'. If the equivalent was the standard aimed for, health regulator the MHRA had to approve them. It publishes lists of current products that had been given its authorisation to be used.  Earlier this month, Voirrey Coole, 40, who had been a director with PPE Medpro since it was formed on May 12, 2020, suddenly quit the company.  The company filings announced her appointment had been terminated, but her own listing declared her as having resigned. ",
  "7de2a17ddbced7184e77aafbe11036a6f2d4900727711fff7e3638f5": "Arthritis patients will be told by the NHS to lose weight and exercise as the main therapies for their condition under new clinical guidelines. Physical activity may be a better option for relieving pain than painkillers such as paracetamol, the health watchdog says. Starting exercise programmes may initially make the pain worse but this should settle down, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) notes. The guidelines give recommendations on use of medicines, such as offering non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) but not paracetamol or strong opioids. Dr Paul Chrisp, of Nice, said: 'This is because new evidence has shown there was little or no benefit to people's quality of life, pain or psychological distress and particularly in the case of strong opioids, there was evidence that they can cause harm in the longer term, including possible addiction.' More than 10million people in the UK have arthritis. Osteoarthritis is the most common form of the condition. In the guidance, doctors are told to diagnose osteoarthritis themselves without further investigation in people aged 45 or over who have activity-related joint pain. Patients should also have no morning joint-related stiffness, or morning stiffness that lasts no longer than 30 minutes, to be diagnosed this way. The draft guideline says people can be offered tailored exercise programmes, with an explanation that 'doing regular and consistent exercise, even though this may initially cause discomfort, will be beneficial for their joints'. Exercising in the long-term also increases its benefits, the guideline adds. When it comes to weight loss, people will be told that 'any amount of weight loss is likely to be beneficial, but losing 10 per cent of their body weight is likely to be better than 5 per cent'. People can also be referred for hip or knee replacement if their condition cannot be managed in other ways, and referrals should not be held off due to age, sex or obesity. Dr Chrisp added: 'Osteoarthritis can cause people discomfort and prevent them from undertaking some of their normal daily activities. 'However, there is evidence which shows muscle strengthening and aerobic exercise can have an impact on not just managing the condition, but also providing people with an improved quality of life. 'Beginning that journey can be uncomfortable for some people at first, and they should be supported and provided with enough information to help them to manage their condition over a long period of time. 'Whilst topical and sometimes oral NSAIDs remain an important treatment option for osteoarthritis, we have taken the decision to not recommend some painkillers, such as paracetamol and some opioids for osteoarthritis.' Tracey Loftis, head of policy and public affairs at the charity Versus Arthritis, said: 'We've seen first-hand the benefits that people with osteoarthritis can get in being able to access appropriate physical activity, especially when in a group-setting. 'Something like exercise can improve a person's mobility, help manage their pain and reduce feelings of isolation. 'But our own research into the support given to people with osteoarthritis showed that far too many do not have their conditions regularly reviewed by healthcare professionals, and even fewer had the opportunity to access physical activity support. 'The lack of alternatives means that, in many cases, people are stuck on painkillers that are not helping them to live a life free from pain. 'While we welcome the draft Nice guidelines, healthcare professionals need further resources and support to better understand their role in promoting treatment like physical activity for people with osteoarthritis. 'There is clearly a need for people with arthritis to be given a bigger voice so that their health needs are not ignored.'",
  "c90d2aacb6e7fedc899eb7fcec2eb872087fe57eb2b406da9b8099ee": "Around one in five people in England will contract skin cancer during their lifetime, say experts.  Cases have hit a record level and the specialists believe an ageing population and improvements to how cancers are reported are behind the rise.  Increasing exposure to the sun and more foreign holidays may also be to blame. There were 224,092 skin cancers recorded in England in 2019, a rise of 26 per cent on the 177,677 recorded in 2013, according to figures analysed by NHS Digital and the British Association of Dermatologists.  Between 2013 and 2019 the total was more than 1.4million. Dr Tanya Bleiker, the association's president, said: 'We are fast approaching a quarter of a million cases a year in England. We estimate that one in five people will have a skin cancer in their lifetime.  'While more needs to be done to prevent skin cancer, we also need to increase the resources available to tackle the rise.'  A breakdown shows there were 15,332 melanomas in 2019, up from 12,885 in 2013. Melanoma is less common than other skin cancers but can be more deadly.  There were also 47,977 cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas in 2019, up from 34,672 in 2013. When caught early this skin cancer is mostly curable.

  "e0a46232dfdc50df5ae51a10ce281d2b11bb41a9cba185349e52e8da": "James Corden will step down as the host of The Late Late Show at the end of next season amid plans to spend more time back home in the UK, DailyMail.com can confirm. The Brit, 43, made the decision to quit at the end of season eight despite the best efforts of CBS executives who exclusively told DailyMail.com that they 'desperately tried to keep him for longer.' The star and his wife of 10 years Jules are mulling over a return to the UK with their three children Max, 11, Carey, seven, and Charlotte, four, but they are still trying to 'figure out' what's next for the family.  An insider tells DailyMail.com that spending more time in the UK when the show ends is 'definitely on the horizon'.  Another source suggested he is planning on moving close to West Ham United's London Stadium in east London.  An insider told the Sun: 'James and Jules have had barely any time to see their families in the UK over the past few years due to his work schedule. They will go backwards and forwards for a while. 'Long-term, they both want to see more of their parents and are considering a permanent move back in a couple of years. 'They sold their house in London so would have to look for a new base in the capital.' The Late Late Show, which films out of Los Angeles, first premiered in 1995 with host Tom Snyder. Craig Kilborn and Craig Ferguson followed as host until James Corden came along in 2015.  Corden promised to 'go out with a bang' as he informed audiences of his decision to step down as the host of The Late Late Show. Revealing the news during the latest episode of the US talk show he said the show had 'changed my life' and promised there would be 'lots of tears' when his tenure came to an end. 'Seven and half years ago I started hosting this show and there's no other way to put it, it has changed my life,' he said. 'I never saw as it as my final destination, and I never want this show to overstay its welcome, I love making it and I really think in a year from now that will be a good time to move on and see what's out there.' He added: 'We are all determined to make this the best year we have ever had...we are going to go out with a bang. 'The fact that you watch this...all over the world...is an absolute privilege for me and every single person who makes this show.' 'We [CBS] desperately tried to keep him for longer but James only wanted to do one final year that will keep him on the show until next year,' a senior CBS source revealed. 'He's been such a hit for us for so many years, we will miss him very much.' 'It's very rare to find a talent who can redefine a long running format. His skits went viral globally, smashing records and creating the most watched online clips in the history of late night TV,' they continued.  'The biggest stars in the world have appeared on his show - which even took him to the White House!' Corden told Deadline it's been a difficult decision after enjoying such huge success.  'It's been it's a really hard decision to leave because I'm so immensely proud of the show. I'm thrilled to be extending [for a year]. I always thought I'd do it for five years and then leave and then I stayed on. I've really been thinking about it for a long time, thinking whether there might be one more adventure.' When asked if he plans to move home, Corden said he and his wife 'genuinely don't know the answer to that'. 'It's something we think about and we talk about a lot but we haven't really made a decision on that yet. That's the life side of things which we'll figure out,' he added.  'I love living here [in LA]. I love everything it's given. My family and I have never taken this incredible adventure for granted. Every day I drive down Sunset to work and I just think I'm from High Wycombe.' James Corden has played host to many A-lister guests on the Late Late Show. Famous faces who've appeared on his show include:  The show has also won a slew of awards, picking up 11 gongs and being nominated for 33 more.  Its wins include:  Primetime Emmy 2016 - Outstanding Interactive Program  Critics Choice Award 2020 - Best talk show  Critics' Choice TV Award 2016 - Best talk show Telly Awards 2018 - Bronze Telly Comedy Use of Humor  Webby Awards 2021 - Social - Celebrity/Fan Social - Entertainment  Video - Comedy: Shortform Webby Awards 2020 - Video - Entertainment (Video Series & Channels)  YouTube Creator awards 2017 - Diamond Creator Award   He did admit he's eager to spend more time with his close pal Mark Noble, who is the captain of his favorite football team West Ham United. Noble is retiring at the end of this season. 'He's the happiest that I'm not leaving in September because he's desperate to get out and play some golf,' Corden said.  'I'll have been here for eight and a half years, he's been at that club since he was nine. Nothing makes me happier to be thought of in the same breath as Mark Noble but I would be undeserving of such praise.' An insider added to DailyMail: 'What's next? Well James is focused on producing a really spectacular current and final season of the show.' 'He'll also be launching Mammals in autumn (Fall), which he is excited about.' 'However more time in the UK after filming wraps is definitely on the horizon as he is very close with his family there.' Under Corden's tenure at The Late Late Show, he developed smash hit segments like Carpool Karaoke, where he drives a celebrity around and they sing together. Carpool Karaoke was later spun off into its own show for Apple in 2017 and even took home an Emmy Award. It currently in season five. 'He told us that he has had an amazing time and is incredibly grateful to CBS but feels now is right time to go out on a high and make his final year the biggest one yet,' a CBS source said. 'James and the show have won countless Emmys, he's won a Critics Choice as well as winning a Tony Award in 2012 before taking his post at CBS. He immediately won critics and fans over as well as the huge celebrities he managed to secure.' The father-of-three has previously referred to his team on the show as his family and even paid them out of his own pocket during the pandemic. James' time at the network has not been without controversy, however. In 2021, the show was forced to change one of Corden's more famous skits, Spill Your Guts, after it as accused of being anti-Asian. The segment, which has featured stars such as Justin Bieber, Kendall Jenner and Chrissy Teigen, sees participants presented with the choice of either answering a prying question or eating something dubbed 'gross'. Several of the unpalatable items hailed from Asian culture and Corden himself had called many of them 'disgusting.' Last summer, a TikTok user launched the Change.org petition which garnered nearly 50,000 signatures and James later announced on the Howard Stern Show that he would no longer use Asian foods in the segment. But Corden admits leaving the show will be a bittersweet farewell for him.  'I'll miss the adrenaline of thinking 'Next week I'm going to jump out of a plane with Tom Cruise or in two weeks' time, we're going to drive around the White House in a car with Michelle Obama or sing Penny Lane with Paul McCartney driving down Penny Lane,' he said. Beyond his own show, James hosted the Tony Awards and Grammy Awards, as well as fronting other prime time shows for CBS and the Friends reunion for HBO Max.  He also has a film career starring in movies like Peter Rabbit, Prom, Into the Woods, Trolls and Cats. He will appear in a new Prime Video drama, Mammals, later this year - his first British TV role since his Gavin And Stacey Christmas special broke records as the most watched non spring event in the UK of the last decade. From Hollyoaks to Hollywood: How lad from High Wycombe who started out in soap became friend of royalty and one half of Tinseltown power couple with some of showbiz's biggest players on speed-dial  James Corden is set to leave the Late Late Show to spend more time with his family in the UK, capping an extraordinary journey for a star who first found fame as an Essex lad before schmoozing his way into a Los Angeles lifestyle that rivals that of any global megastar. Corden and his interior designer wife Julia have a roll-call of Hollywood royalty on speed-dial after carefully cultivating connections with the industry's biggest movers and shakers. The Cordens' social status was cemented when they were invited to the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's wedding where James was asked to compere the private evening reception. There they were spotted chatting with the Clooneys who, it turns out, are among the clients' of Julia's interior design brand Charles & Co. Also there were David and Victoria Beckham, who also called upon the firm when it came to redecorating. Among the Cordens' close friends are Harry Styles and Dominic Cooper, while James has had everyone from Sir Elton John to Tom Hanks and Lady Gaga on his show. The couple also boast a home worthy of Hollywood superstars, living in a PS7.3 million mansion in Brentwood, an upmarket LA suburb, with their three children. The property hast five bedrooms, eight bathrooms and a pool, plus such typically Hollywood features as a wood-panelled library, cinema room and gym. However, it wasn't all glitz and glamour for Corden. The actor, 43, made his first stage appearance at the age of 18 in a one-line role. He then went on to interview Meat Loaf before enjoying a small role in an episode of Hollyoaks.  He first came to prominence from 2000 to 2005, when he starred in Fat Friends as Jamie Rymer. His work in the series earned him a nomination for the 2000 Royal Television Society Award for Network Newcomer On Screen.  Corden's Fat Friends co-star Ruth Jones would pay a pivotal role in his future, with the two combining for the popular BBC Three sitcom Gavin and Stacey. The duo co-wrote the smash-hit show and also starred as the titular characters' friends. His role as Essex lad Smithy catapulted Corden into British stardom. Suddenly, his face was everywhere and starred editions of Comic Relief, performed England's World Cup football song with Dizzie Rascal and was even given a guest role in an episode of Doctor Who.  The Gavin And Stacey star first cracked America when his stage show One Man Two Guvnors transferred to Broadway in 2012 after a successful stint in the West End.  He was then catapulted to worldwide fame after he made his debut as the presenter of The Late, Late Show in 2015, taking over the role from Craig Ferguson. With the immense popularity of segments like Carpool Karaoke, James has become one of America's most beloved late night presenters. And thanks to his success on The Late, Late Show, James has landed a number of roles in Hollywood films like Into The Woods and The Prom, and he has also hosted the Tony Awards.   He has since reportedly more than doubled his wealth to a whopping PS50m after moving to Hollywood.  Following his move to LA, James has become one of the partners at film production company Fulwell 73 and seen his assets swell.  He was previously estimated as being worth around PS22m, however in the latest accounts from his company the business' assets are declared as PS140m.   The star also has earnings from his film and TV roles, with him thought to earn $7m for The Late Late Show, as well as millions of dollars tied up in his properties.  From decorating the homes of celebrities to hosting them on a chatshow, Julia and James have settled into the centre of life in Los Angeles. Since relocating to the States, Corden has drawn other high-profile pals into his circle, including U2 frontman Bono and actor Sean Penn. Mary Poppins actress Emily Blunt and her American husband John Krasinski - one of Hollywood's most popular power couples - are regular guests at his home. When he was still a jobbing actor, known mainly for his role in the Alan Bennett play The History Boys, Corden shared a flat above a London doughnut shop with Dominic Cooper. Corden joked that there was no furniture and only one piece of cutlery, a spatula, and that the fridge contained only 'half a vitamin water and a Lindt chocolate bunny'. Today, he shares a PS7.3 million mansion in Brentwood, an upmarket LA suburb, with Julia and their three children. There are five bedrooms, eight bathrooms and a pool, plus such typically Hollywood features as a wood-panelled library, cinema room and gym. It also has its own spa and an office complete with high-tech film editing facilities. While he stays in LA, Corden rents out the family's PS3 million London home in leafy Belsize Park for about PS15,000 a month. His neighbours in Brentwood -just a 20-minute drive from the CBS studios where his chat show is filmed - include Gwyneth Paltrow, Cindy Crawford, Harrison Ford and Steven Spielberg. 'The children are happy and healthy and love their circle of friends,' says the source. 'James is a devoted dad and spends a lot of time with the kids. His weekends are sacrosanct. 'James knows none of this success would mean anything without Julia's love and support. His family means everything to him.' Out on the town, Corden favours the luxurious Tower Bar at the Sunset Tower Hotel in West Hollywood, where phone calls and photos are banned. Jennifer Aniston held her 50th birthday party there in February. Corden's tipple? Don Julio 1492 tequila at PS120 a bottle. 'The best parties are at his house,' says the source. 'He'll hire a team of private chefs and you never know who will be there, from the heads of TV networks to stars like Emily Blunt.' There is, too, an unlikely friendship with Anna Wintour, the formidable British editor of American Vogue. They met after Anna saw Corden in the Broadway version of the play One Man, Two Guvnors in 2011 and sent him a card telling him she was his biggest fan. 'Through her, he has met everyone,' says the source. James' Carpool Karaoke has seen the funny-man bantering with megastars like Madonna, Britney Spears and Adele. Meanwhile stars among their closest circle include One Direction star Harry Styles, with Corden recently lending him his Palm Springs home while the musician was shooting his part in Wilde's new movie. His relationship with Mamma Mia star Dominic Cooper dates back to 2004 when they were rooming together and starring in The History Boys, a British campus comedy. Speaking of their days sharing a flat in London on James' chat show, The Late Late Show, Dominic reminisced on how they would often sleep in the same bed due to the lack of furniture. He said: 'We were never there at the same time much, were we? But when we were, there was absolutely no furniture.We had a bed, one bed. We only had one piece of cutlery which was a spatula. 'I remember one depressing evening, he caught me, he came home and I was eating baked beans with the spatula.' James added: 'We rented it furnished. It had no furniture in it and we never thought to complain.' It was Dominic who introduced James to now wife Julia, who was an old school friend of his. He told People : 'I said, 'Hi, Jules. You might be the most beautiful woman in the world.' She said, 'Well, thank you very much. That sounds like something you say a lot.' 'And I said, 'I've never said it before in my life.' That was it. That was it, really. I was in. And by an absolute miracle, so was she.' Later, the two slinked off to a corner to plan the rest of their lives, with James revealing: 'I remember saying to her, 'Well, what about on Friday we could do nothing together? You could come over and we could just do nothing. 'And then maybe we could do nothing on Saturday, and we could do nothing on the Sunday. And if our evenings are enough of nothing, then maybe this would become something.' 'And she said, 'That sounds like a fun idea.' James proposed on holiday in the Maldives in 2008, while Julia was expecting their eldest son Max. They married in September 2012 at Babington House, with a spectacular guest list including Lara Stone, comedian Michael McIntyre, and Snow Patrol lead singer Gary Lightbody. The couple also have two daughters, Charlotte, six, and Carey, three. James and Prince Harry have been friends for years. He previously told People: 'The friendship mostly started with being out and about the same places in London.' The chat show host and his wife Julia attended the royal wedding to Meghan Markle in May 2018. At the time, he described the nuptials, revealing: 'It was so lovely. I've known Prince Harry about seven years now and it was wonderful. 'It was one of the most beautiful ceremonies I've ever been to. It was gorgeous, it was a whole affair, it was happy, it was joyous, it was uplifting.' James made a showstopping entrance to the palace afterparty as it was claimed he arrived at Prince Harry and Meghan 's wedding reception dressed up as King Henry VIII. At the time, People Magazine reported the presenter arrived last to the reception, clad in the monarch's signature Tudor costume, saying he 'didn't know what to wear'. When he was still a jobbing actor, known mainly for his role in the Alan Bennett play The History Boys, Corden shared a flat above a London doughnut shop with Dominic Cooper (now star of hit TV show Preacher). Corden joked that there was no furniture and only one piece of cutlery, a spatula, and that the fridge contained only 'half a vitamin water and a Lindt chocolate bunny'. Today, he shares a PS7.3 million mansion in Brentwood, an upmarket LA suburb, with Julia and their three children.

'He'll hire a team of private chefs and you never know who will be there, from the heads of TV networks to stars like Emily Blunt.' He said: 'Harry asked me to do some kind of performance...it was fun, it was a really special day.' Meanwhile the presenter also stole the march on Oprah by airing his antics with Prince Harry days before the prime-time interview that enraged Buckingham Palace. In a wide-ranging chat mostly carried out on an open-top bus, the Duke of Sussex - or 'Haz,' as Corden calls him - reveals he went from 'zero to sixty' with Meghan and how the pressures of living in London were 'destroying my mental health.' Meanwhile Julia is co-founded of the interior design company Charles & Co, which counts The Beckhams among its clients While James has a successful acting and presenting career, his wife Julia runs a hugely successful and popular interior design company. With a background in TV production, talent management and PR, she founded Charles & Co in 2016 with Vicky Charles, who was the design director for Soho House having worked for the group for 20 years. The pair were introduced by Soho House CEO Nick Jones and set up the business while Julia was taking time off to have her children. She handles the business side of Charles & Co, recently telling The Telegraph her role is 'to allow Vicky to be as creative as possible.' High-profile clients include the Beckhams, the Clooneys, Emma Stone, Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis. Builds for the pair usually include a 'social, club-like spaces' within their homes, including bars, wine cellars, playrooms and even libraries. Meanwhile others might value a recording studio, with Julia revealing: 'Being able to record a little voiceover without having to leave your house can make a huge difference, especially if you live outside the city.' Last year, James was unveiled as the new ambassador for WW, previously known as Weight Watchers, after becoming 'embarrassed' over his body. During a chat with Oprah Winfrey on WW's Facebook page he revealed he 'hates' doing exercise but his wife Julia plans circuits for them to do. James revealed in the New Year that he has signed up to the health and fitness programme to help shift the conversation around wellness. He said: 'I want to change the way that I live. I want to be better for my children and for my family. I don't want to wake up tired, or feel embarrassed when I'm chasing my son on the soccer field and out of breath after three minutes.' James has been candid about his weight struggles in the past and back in 2017 he shed six stone in weight and found major success in Hollywood, however he has also admitted the one food that he can't stop eating is bread. Speaking about the last time he was 'off bread' for dietary reasons, James recalled an incident while he was out at dinner saying: ''[I have] a sort of battle with food... 'Then they delivered this basket of warm, fresh bread and we're like, 'It's happening, we're doing it. Who are we trying to kid?' 'It's our nemesis, it's out to destroy us!'",
  "d1ace1ca4f86331707a27661fb0466ffcfdfd22d4c0e251bb6bd0c6b": "There have been calls for the MP who is accused of watching pornography in the House of Commons to quit and to be named and shamed. While Boris Johnson himself lashed out at unknown MP today, hinting he faces being kicked out of the Conservative Party. One of those calling for resignation is MP Nickie Aiken, who is also the vice chair of the 2022 Committee - a recently formed Tory group to push for gender equality. The male MP in question 'has to resign', she told Times Radio, saying the individual was causing 'pain, suffering & embarrassment' to the Conservative Party and to Parliament. Former minister Caroline Nokes has accused the chief whip of avoiding addressing the issue, and said the whip should have been suspended already. Chief whip Chris Heaton-Harris has chosen to not immediately discipline the MP. Instead, the allegations will be left to the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS) - a decision which has been criticised as the process can last for years and during which those accused remain anonymous. According to The Telegraph, the person facing the accusations is not a relatively new MP and was not in the intakes of Tories in the 2015, 2017 and 2019 elections. A spokeswoman for Mr Heaton-Harris said: 'Following allegations of inappropriate behaviour in the House of Commons the chief whip has asked that this matter be referred to the ICGS. 'Upon the conclusion of any ICGS investigation the chief whip will take appropriate action.' Speaking to reporters in Lancashire, Mr Johnson was asked whether the parliamentarian would lose the Conservative whip if the allegations are proven. 'I think it's obviously unacceptable for anybody to be doing that kind of thing in the workplace,' he said. 'It would be the same for any kind of job up and down the country, let's be absolutely clear about that. 'What needs to happen now is that the proper procedures need to be gone through, the independent complaints and grievances procedure needs to be activated and we need to get to understand the facts, but, yeah, that kind of behaviour is clearly totally unacceptable.' It came as the sleaze issue crossed the aisle, with a Labour frontbencher accused of telling one of his party's female MPs they were a 'secret weapon' because men wanted to sleep with them. The female politician - who wants to remain anonymous - was allegedly subjected to the lewd remark at an event in Westminster. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace also urged MPs to stay out of Parliament's 'poisonous' drinking dens amid growing uproar at sexism and sleaze at Westminster. Mr Wallace said the long hours and access to alcohol had been a problem for many years, and his advice to colleagues was 'finish your day's work and go home'. In the latest grim claims, a woman MP told BBC Wales that when someone praised her as a 'rising star' of her party at an event, the unnamed shadow cabinet minister intervened.  They apparently said she was a 'secret weapon' because 'women want to be her friend' and men wanted to sleep with her. 'She is a vote winner,' they reportedly added. Keir Starmer said: 'I'm deeply concerned to hear these suggestions and these allegations. 'There is a complaints procedure and I want everybody to have the confidence to use that complaints procedure because I would want to get to the bottom of this and do something about it.' A Labour spokeswoman said: 'The Labour Party takes all complaints extremely seriously.    'They are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures, and any appropriate action is taken.' It is understood that no complaint has been received, and BBC Wales said the woman did not want to be identified for fear of consequences.  Labour has recently introduced a new independent complaints procedure to boost confidence, and is encouraging people to come forward. In a round of interviews this morning, Mr Wallace said 'there's no place for pornography in any workplace' and said there needs to be a cultural change in Westminster. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I certainly think they should lose the whip.' He pointed to the handful of exclusive bars on the Parliamentary estate, where drinks are much cheaper than outside, with a pint of beer costing around PS3.60. Mr Wallace told Times Radio that there were 'fights', 'sexist comments' and 'propositions' in the bars.  'What I have witnessed is, what I think is the fundamental problem of Westminster, is the overall culture is that hundreds and hundreds of people (are) working long hours in a place with bars,' he said. 'And for some people, under lots of pressure for all sorts of reasons. And that... mix becomes poisonous.'  Mr Wallace said the problems had been 'going on for decades' and were 'not easy to fix'.  'I mean, my advice to any MP is actually avoid the bars, you know, finish a day's work and go home.  'But you know, that is part of the ultimate challenge around parliament that I think needs to be fixed.  'And you know, in the Armed Forces, I have a similar challenge, which is often in those high pressure environments where people mix and then alcohol is consumed, you end up in a place where people do things, either they regret, or things that is totally unacceptable.'  The Defence Secretary told Sky News: 'There is a range of allegations that go right across the House, go right across the parties. 'This is a problem, I think, about the overall culture of the House of Commons. 'It is late sitting, long nights with bars, and that very often leads, and it has done for decades, to behavioural challenges... 'I think it's really important that we think about ways to change the culture in the House of Commons.' Attorney General Suella Braverman told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour that if the allegation of an MP watching porn in Parliament is proven there should be a 'severe reprimand' including an opportunity to oust them from the Commons. 'I'm shocked and appalled... what would possess them? It is totally unacceptable,' she said. 'I am very glad that the chief whip has now referred it to the independent complaints and grievance process.' Ms Braverman went on: 'I think we would really need to see a situation where the whip would be removed. I am ashamed that this person is carrying the Conservative rosette. 'I think they really do need to be subject to a recall, and no longer holding their privileged position as a member of parliament.' Ms Braverman said while all the men she had worked with were 'respectful' there were MPs who behaved like 'animals'.  'There is however, a very small minority of men - and it is men - who fall short, and there are some bad apples who are out of order, who behave like animals and are bringing parliament into disrepute to be honest,' she said. 'I don't think we should be saying there is a pervasive culture. That is not my experience. There are certain individuals who are behaving in an unacceptable way.'   The Conservative Party's chief whip has ordered an official investigation into claims that an MP was watching porn on his mobile phone in the House of Commons Chamber. A spokesman said the matter would be referred to Parliament's independent complaints and grievance scheme (ICGS). 'Following allegations of inappropriate behaviour in the House of Commons the Chief Whip has asked that this matter be referred to the ICGS. 'Upon the conclusion of any ICGS investigation the Chief Whip will take appropriate action.'  Ms Nokes told PoliticsHome the referral amounted to 'kicking it into the long grass' and it would be 'months before anything is done'. 'It's not shouldering the burden of responsibility of dealing with it, and I think the Chiefs should have dealt with it immediately,' she said.  Sir Keir said the Conservative Party should 'take action now' against the MP. He said: 'I think it's very good that we've got an independent system and obviously that requires anonymity. 'This is an unusual case because the Tory Party knows who this individual is. 'I think that they should deal with it and deal with it sooner rather than later and take appropriate action. 'So, nothing wrong with the independent process, but I think the Tory Party, they know who this is, they should take action now.' Those reported to the body are given automatic anonymity, meaning the Tory MP's name will not be published while he is under investigation. Only witnesses are able to make complaints to the scheme. The body is said to be investigating at least 56 MPs - including three ministers and two shadow ministers - who have been accused of sexual misconduct. Two female MPs say they witnessed their colleague looking at adult images more than once.",
  "1c54c7fc7697f4b3f1073e082547ddabaa18da8ecc5f7f8408dace47": "Around 8,000 British Army troops and dozens of tanks will take part in exercises across eastern Europe to combat Russian aggression in one of the largest deployments since the Cold War. Tens of thousands of Nato troops will join the British forces that will be deployed to countries ranging from Finland to North Macedonia this summer under plans that have been enhanced since the invasion of Ukraine. The Joint Expeditionary Force alliance, which includes Finland and Sweden, will also be taking part. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said the purpose behind the exercises is to demonstrate how the British Army has modernised into a 'lethal, agile and global force'. The action had been long planned, but that it had been enhanced in response since Russia invaded its neighbour in late February. Only yesterday was the first UK casualty in Ukraine confirmed, Scott Sibley, a veteran of the British armed forces had served in the Commando Logistic Support Squadron in Afghanistan. Commander Field Army Lieutenant General Ralph Wooddisse emphasised the importance of the exercises, he said: 'The UK makes a significant contribution to the defence of Europe and the deterrence of Russian aggression. 'The British Army's series of exercises is fundamental to both. 'The scale of the deployment, coupled with the professionalism, training and agility of the British Army, will deter aggression at a scale not seen in Europe this century.' The UK deployment is expected to build to a peak of around 8,000 personnel operating in mainland Europe between April and June. Troops from B Squadron of the Queen's Royal Hussars have already deployed to Finland, which shares an 830 mile land border with Russia, to take part in Exercise Arrow. Exercise Hedgehog next month will involve the Royal Welsh battlegroup and the Royal Tank Regiment, with exercises planned on the Estonia/Latvia border alongside 18,000 Nato troops. Hedgehog, the biggest military exercise in Estonia, takes place every four years and will involve a range of units including light and airborne forces, helicopters, armoured forces, artillery and air defence. Exercises alongside American troops are also taking place in Poland.  Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: 'The security of Europe has never been more important. 'These exercises will see our troops join forces with allies and partners across Nato and the Joint Expeditionary Force in a show of solidarity and strength in one of the largest shared deployments since the Cold War.'",
  "0a2ce2ed836154aa0b395cbfbc0a4fc309b315cbd1682aa8aaf4e6e4": "Jacob Rees-Mogg has shared an image of an empty Cabinet Office which enraged him so much that he left noted for the civil servants who were working from home.  Mr Rees-Mogg's zealous attempts to end WFH raised eyebrows this week, after he left notes on empty desks at Whitehall.  However, he has now revealed the notes were prompted by his shock after discovering the Cabinet Office abandoned at 11am on a weekday.   He also said that some desk and computers were unused with notices on the walls date from before the pandemic.   Speaking to the Sun, the MP said: 'It looked as if the office hadn't been used in two years. 'Thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money is being spent, and either they need to be there or not. If not, we should put somebody in this property.' Discussing the message he left on a whiteboard while on a visit to the Eurotunnel in Folkestone, Kent, he added: 'I wrote on the whiteboard saying, 'Can we reallocate this space because you clearly don't need it?' Mr Rees-Mogg's zealous attempts to end WFH, including leaving notes on empty desks, have not been backed by other ministers, with Nadine Dorries accusing him of a 'Dickensian' approach to the issue. The Cabinet is also said to have backed away from the idea of stripping London weighting from the salaries of people who are still not yet commuting back into the capital. Dave Penman, the secretary general of the Civil service's FDA union, said: 'Hybrid working can save taxpayers millions by reducing the government estate and the pandemic showed that effective public services can be delivered regardless of where staff are placed.' Mr Rees-Mogg has written to Cabinet ministers calling on them to issue a clear message to staff about a 'rapid return to the office' and has been leaving notes in empty Whitehall workspaces with the message: 'I look forward to seeing you in the office very soon.' Downing Street said Boris Johnson supported Mr Rees-Mogg's efforts. 'What the minister is seeking to achieve is to do everything possible to get the civil service to return to the pre-pandemic level,' the Prime Minister's official spokesman said. 'That is what he is seeking to do. That is supported by the Cabinet Secretary and obviously the Prime Minister.' But the Guardian later reported that the country's most senior civil servant, Simon Case, had in fact privately warned Mr Johnson against forcing officials back to the office. The newspaper said at least four permanent secretaries were also understood to have voiced concerns about the Government's rhetoric on the matter Mr Rees-Mogg presented figures to Cabinet last week showing that some Government departments were using as little as 25 per cent of office capacity in early April - the figure for Ms Dorries' Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport was 43 per cent. Ms Dorries told him his letter to Government departments brought to mind 'images of burning tallow, rheumy eyes and Marley's ghost' - a reference to Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol.",
  "cac59921b348d8071e26f8c7a93fbcc1083ffc0710ec32e0992c3458": "Russian sources have published a list of what they claim are 100 British 'mercenaries' fighting in Ukraine, including the name of one woman.  It comes on the news that a British father has been killed in Ukraine and a second Briton is missing after the pair apparently joined local forces fighting Russia.  Scott Sibley, a veteran of the British armed forces who served in the Commando Logistic Support Squadron in Afghanistan, has been named as the first UK casualty in Ukraine.  A pro-war Telegram channel called Rybar with almost 400,000 subscribers claimed the 100 British citizens whose names were published were part of the 'International Legion of Territorial Defence of Ukraine', also known as the Ukrainian Foreign Legion. The list does not include the name of Scott Sibley and it is unclear how authentic it is.  'On April 5 we said that there were less than 700 people there, excluding employees of PMCs [private military companies],' said a report from the pro-Putin Russian channel. 'Now you know their names, dates of birth and ID numbers.' It is unclear where the list came from but Rybar suggests it was obtained via the offices of the governor of Mykolayiv region, Vitaliy Kim. The names do not include British fighters recently detained by the Russians in Mariupol. The publication of the list comes on the same day Ukrainian military officials released pictured and revealed names of Russian soldiers dubbed the 'Despicable Ten' accused of carrying out war crimes in Bucha. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defence released the names and faces of the men, stating: 'Ten Russian butchers from the 64th brigade have been identified and named suspects responsible for committing the Bucha massacre. 'This unit [has] been awarded for its atrocities, and returned to the battlefield. Justice for war criminals is inevitable.' The UK's Foreign Office confirmed that British national Sibley had been killed in Ukraine and the whereabouts of a second Briton is unknown. It is thought that the two men had been fighting against Russian fighters after joining Ukrainian soldiers as volunteers, but this remains unconfirmed.  Friends of Sibley, fondly nicknamed Sibs, have paid tribute to the veteran, who is believed to have died on 23 April, and set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for his funeral. 'Scott was a son, father, brother and uncle,' his friend Craig wrote on the page. 'To me he was a friend like no other and the bravest person I've had the pleasure to have known, he was as good as a brother to me. 'His life may have been cut short but he lived to the full and did things the Sibs way, right until the end.' Another fundraising page set up for Sibley's relatives described his 'infectious laugh', adding: 'We all have memories with him and he has helped us in different ways.' Sibley leaves behind his daughter who was diagnosed with stage 4 high risk Neuroblastoma, a rare form of cancer that mostly affects young children. Following her diagnosis in 2018, Sibley shaved his head so that his daughter would not feel different when she lost her hair, reported the BBC.  Sibley's former squadron, the Army's Logistic Support Squadron, paid tribute to the veteran, writing: 'This week the Sqn has lost a former serving soldier. A man that showed Commando spirit until the end. RIP. Scott Sibley.' A former comrade, Alex Darwin, paid tribute to his friend. 'Sib, I'm in complete disbelief. What a pleasure to have served alongside you, to know you and to have experienced your kind nature. 'You were there for me and I will forever be grateful. One hell of a beautiful guy, inside and out.' There was no reply last night from Scott Sibley's family home - a humble end of terrace house on a council estate in the village of South Killingholme, near Immingham, North Lincolnshire. It is understood Scott grew up in the area with mum Mary, dad Melvin, known as Mel, and sister Victoria. Locals said Scott had left the family home and understood he had been living in London with his own family. Neighbour Tracey Mcinanny said: 'They are away. They have gone down to be with Scott's family. We only know what we have heard on the news. I believe he went to Immingham School. His dad, Mel, works away. I have lived here several years and they were here when I got here. 'I assume they have gone to London to be with the kids Scott had. Like most kids, he had moved away from his parents to get on with their lives. 'It is very sad. But the guy thought he was doing what was right. 'I remember Scott as an older teenager. I did not know him but him and his sister seemed nice, quiet kids. 'They kept themselves to themselves. Both parents were working. You always hear about the bad kids but never Scott or sister.' The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) did not provide details on why the men were in Ukraine. 'We can confirm that a British National has been killed in Ukraine and are supporting their family,' a FCDO spokesperson said. Speaking of the second British man, the spokesperson said: 'We are aware of a British National who is missing in Ukraine and are supporting their family. We are urgently seeking further information. '  A number of Britons travelled to Ukraine after Russia invaded the country on February 24 to fight on the front lines against Vladimir Putin's men. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had called for foreign fighters to join his country's defence against Russia in the days after the invasion. Downing Street has strongly advised against Britons from travelling to Ukraine to fight, whilst serving members of the British Armed Forces have been banned from doing so. Earlier this month, Britons Aiden Aslin, 28, and Shaun Pinner, 48, were captured by Russian forces and have since been paraded on Russian state media where they pleaded to be swapped for a pro-Kremlin prisoner. Aslin and Shaun Pinner last week asked on Russian state television for UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson to intervene and ensure they were exchanged for Vladimir Putin's ally Viktor Medvedchuk, who is being held by Ukrainian authorities. Pinner is a former Royal Anglian soldier and has made clear he considers Ukraine his second country, where he married. The UK's Foreign Enlistment Act blocks citizens from joining foreign militaries fighting countries at peace with Britain, and the government's foreign secretary and defence minister have warned against Britons fighting in Ukraine after the war began in late February.  Just days after the invasion on February 24, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss was criticised after she said she would 'absolutely' support Britons who chose to help the war effort. 'People can make their own decisions,' she said. 'The people of Ukraine are fighting for freedom and democracy, not just for Ukraine, but for the whole of Europe. Absolutely, if people want to support that struggle, I would support them in doing that.' The UK Government website warns: 'If you travel to Ukraine to fight, or to assist others engaged in the conflict, your activities may amount to offences against UK legislation and you could be prosecuted on your return to the UK.' At the outset of the invasion, Ukraine encouraged foreigners to offer their support. President Zelensky has claimed 16,000 foreigners have travelled to Ukraine to resist the Russians. In March, groups of British men gathered outside the Ukrainian embassy in London to offer their support. This is a breaking news story, more to follow...  ",
  "83fa235b98f540b9910812dc7f3a6009bf340f13f928f85bd8034211": "Labour last night admitted it had lied about an event at which Sir Keir Starmer is alleged to have broken lockdown rules.  In a sensational U-turn, Labour acknowledged that Angela Rayner was also at the event on April 30 last year at which Sir Keir was filmed enjoying a beer with officials at a time when indoor socialising was banned.  A Labour spokesman said last night: 'Angela was present.' A party source claimed the previous denials had been 'an honest mistake'.  It directly contradicts assurances given to the Daily Mail over the past three months that Mrs Rayner was 'not there'.  The admission came only after this newspaper confronted Labour officials with video evidence that Mrs Rayner had joined Sir Keir at an online rally for activists filmed in the Durham offices of Labour MP Mary Foy where the party leader was later seen drinking.  The extraordinary revelation raises questions about whether Labour's deputy leader also broke lockdown rules. A woman MP has claimed a Shadow Cabinet minister said she was a 'secret weapon' because men wanted to sleep with her.  The member of Sir Keir Starmer's top team is alleged to have made the lewd comment after the woman was described as a 'rising star' of the party at an event.  The Welsh MP, who wants to remain anonymous, told the BBC that before she could reply, the frontbencher intervened to describe her as 'a secret weapon'.  He said 'women want to be her friend' and, using a swear word, that men want to sleep with her, before adding: 'She is a vote winner.'  The MP said she chose not to make a formal complaint.  Labour said yesterday that the issue would be taken 'extremely seriously' if one was received. Labour leader Sir Keir said: 'I'm deeply concerned to hear these suggestions and these allegations. There is a complaints procedure and I want everybody to have the confidence to use that procedure because I would want to get to the bottom of this and do something about it.'  Labour MP Jonathan Ashworth said the party should investigate even if a formal complaint had not been made.  Conservative MP Brendan Clarke Smith said last night: 'For all their sanctimony about honesty and transparency, it's plain to see that Labour have not told the truth about Keir Starmer's lockdown drinks party.  'Why would they lie about Angela Rayner's presence if they thought the event was legal? It makes you wonder what else they are hiding.'  In another astonishing development, the Mail can reveal that Mrs Foy was forced to apologise this week after launching a 'drunken' tirade on the Commons terrace against 'Men want to sleep with you' slur Tory MP Richard Holden, who has led calls for Durham Police to reopen the case.  Last night Mrs Rayner was also facing questions over her denials that she had joked with Tory MPs about crossing and uncrossing her legs to distract Boris Johnson in the Commons.  The claim in The Mail on Sunday provoked a storm of criticism on social media this week and a demand from the Commons Speaker for the newspaper's editor to explain himself.  Mrs Rayner described the article as 'desperate, perverted smears'. But The Daily Telegraph yesterday revealed it had spoken to two Tory MPs who corroborated the claim that Mrs Rayner had joked about giving the PM 'a flash'. Separately, The Mail On Sunday has now spoken to four Tory MPs who have all supported the account and contradicted the insinuation by Mrs Rayner and her allies that the claims were cooked up by sexist colleagues.  On a day of shame for Labour:   The Daily Mail first asked Labour on January 14 whether Mrs Rayner had been present at the notorious Durham drinks event.  A senior Labour official replied: 'Goodness me, with all that's going on. It's an old story! Angela wasn't there. It was Mary Foy's office.'  But rumours about Mrs Rayner's presence at the meeting persisted. She was pictured in Durham at an election event with Sir Keir early the following morning. And a woman whose head can be seen from behind in the video of Sir Keir has hair which bears a remarkable resemblance to Mrs Rayner's striking red locks.  The Mail presented officials with video evidence that Mrs Rayner had also been present at the Durham Miners Hall that evening.  Sir Keir gave a six-minute speech at the venue to an online party rally. Later in the event, Mrs Rayner appeared on screen in front of the same background Sir Keir had sat in front of 20 minutes earlier.  And she even confirmed exactly where she was, quoting the motto of the Durham Miners. 'Being here at the Miners Hall in Durham, I've got to start with 'the past we inherit, the future we build',' Mrs Rayner said.  Labour yesterday refused to answer a string of further questions from the Mail about the event, which police are now under pressure to investigate.  In January, Sir Keir said: 'We were working in the office. We stopped for something to eat and then we carried on working. No party, no breach of the rules and absolutely no comparison with the Prime Minister.' It can now be established that the online event finished at around 9.20pm, about 45 minutes before Sir Keir was filmed by a passerby drinking from a bottle of beer. Labour officials refused to say how long the 'meal break' lasted, or how many attended.  They also refused to say whether anyone in the leader's office had since spoken to Durham's Labour police and crime commissioner - but denied suggestions she had also been present that evening.  Durham Police said this week they would consider a request from Mr Holden to review their controversial decision that Sir Keir had not broken any rules.  Senior Tories demanded a full investigation, saying there appeared to be no difference between the event and the socalled 'birthday party' in No10, for which Mr Johnson was fined PS50.  Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said detectives should launch a full investigation, adding: 'A consistency of the application of the law, that's what we all deserve - whether we're in London or whether we're in Durham.'  Mr Johnson's spokesman said: 'The PM thinks the law should be applied equally at all times.' 'We made a mistake. Angela WAS present': Labour makes humiliating U-turn after Mail proves Rayner was at 'beergate' event under police review By Martin Beckford for the Daily Mail The WhatsApp message sent by a senior Labour press officer could hardly have been clearer. Asked by the Daily Mail if the party's deputy leader Angela Rayner had been present at the Durham Miners Hall the evening Sir Keir Starmer enjoyed a beer with local MP Mary Foy and other comrades, the spokesman replied categorically: 'Angela wasn't there.' But now that simple claim has been undermined, ironically by Labour's own digital campaigning prowess. Last night, in an astonishing volte-face, Labour belatedly admitted that Mrs Rayner had been there, but gave no further details. The party's about-turn came after a Mail investigation had already established that despite the denials, the party's deputy leader had been in the Miners Hall. Almost a year since the fateful event, when lockdown laws at the time banned indoor socialising except within a household or support bubble, the party's Facebook page still shows a video that proves Sir Keir and Mrs Rayner were in the same building at the same time. It can be revealed today that less than an hour before the infamous video was taken of Sir Keir with bottle in hand, he and his deputy sat at the same desk to address Labour activists across the country. They were the star turns in a live online rally being held less than a week before the country went to the ballot boxes in the pair's first major electoral test. It was advertised by frontbencher Nick Thomas-Symonds in a social media post that can still be viewed today. 'Tune in 8.30pm-9pm tonight for Labour's Get Out The Vote '6 Days to 6th May' rally with Keir Starmer, Angela Rayner and special guests,' he wrote on Twitter on the afternoon of Friday, April 30. He helpfully included a link to the Facebook page hosting the virtual campaigning event, which not only remains online but includes a complete video of the 48-minute proceedings. It was hosted by Labour MP Carolyn Harris, broadcasting from her home in Wales. She made it clear the rally was live by announcing: 'Well, hello everyone and welcome to the very last Friday before May 6.' After her introduction she handed over to Sir Keir, who was wearing the same open-necked white shirt which would later be seen in the clip filmed by passers-by as he drank a bottle of beer. As he addressed voters by webcam, he was sitting in a small room with white walls and a mirror on a mantelpiece that showed the reflection of a distinctive 'half round' fanlight window. Sir Keir gave a six-minute speech to the 16,000 watching online, saying: 'Let me just start by thanking every single person who's on this call this evening. Thank you for joining us.' He said the party was facing 'huge, huge elections', the first since the 'devastating' national poll in December 2019 - which saw Boris Johnson rout his predecessor as Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. Sir Keir claimed the upcoming elections would pit his Labour Party against a 'Conservative Party that's up to its neck in sleaze'. After the rally heard from other speakers, including one in the US, host Miss Harris handed over to the final speaker - Angela Rayner. She appeared on screen in front of the same background Sir Keir had sat in front of less than 20 minutes earlier - the same white walls, the same mirror on the mantelpiece and the same window in the reflection. And she even confirmed exactly where she was, quoting the motto of Durham Miners. 'Being here at the Miners Hall in Durham, I've got to start with 'the past we inherit, the future we build',' Mrs Rayner said. As well as hosting the 'Pitman's Parliament' in decades gone by and being the headquarters of the Durham Miners' Association, the grand Edwardian building is also used for constituency meetings by Mrs Foy. And it is where the party has admitted Sir Keir was when he was caught enjoying a drink with colleagues, including Mrs Foy, in an apparent breach of Covid rules at the time as well as government electioneering guidance that stated: 'You should not meet with other campaigners indoors.' That video was shot a little after 10pm - less than an hour after Mrs Rayner addressed the online rally from a room there. Photos of the hall show that its ground floor has the same distinctive fanlight windows that can be seen in the background of Sir Keir and Mrs Rayner's pieces to camera. The full 43-second clip of the video revealed by the Mail this week shows Sir Keir in another room of the hall, swigging from a bottle of beer and listening to Mrs Foy while two men eat food by the doorway. A woman sitting facing the two Labour MPs had been named by social media users as Joy Allen, then campaigning to be Durham crime tsar. But she has denied being present and the evidence obtained by the Mail suggests the woman is Mrs Rayner. When this newspaper first asked the party's press office in January about Mrs Rayner's possible presence, the reply was unequivocal: 'Angela wasn't there.' But the deputy leader had also shared photos and videos of herself with Sir Keir in the building at the same time. She was wearing the same polka-dot dress as she wore during the online rally and earlier that day while out canvassing hundreds of miles away in Birmingham. The next day - at 8.53am on Saturday, May 1 - she posted two photographs of herself in front of miners' lodges banners at the hall and wrote: 'Last year was the first year in two decades that I couldn't come to Durham. It's good to be back!' Then at 9.45am she shared a video - which again is still online - of herself and Sir Keir touring the building which Labour claims she had not stepped inside. It began with him declaring: 'On International Workers' Day, we're at Redhills, the historic Durham Miners Hall.' Mrs Rayner was filmed outside the building saying: 'From here in Durham to the miners in South Wales, it was working people and trade unionists who created local healthcare systems that laid the foundations for our country's greatest institution, the National Health Service.' The morning after the indoor event, Sir Keir and Mrs Rayner were pictured in hard hats and hi-vis jackets as they visited a major building development in Durham, known as Milburngate. Revealed: Damning testimony from four MPs of Angela Rayner's vulgar joke about Sharon Stone ploy By Glen Owen and Dan Hodges for the Daily Mail Angela Rayner last night risked accusations of a cover-up over the sexism row that has convulsed Westminster. Labour's deputy leader had described a story in last week's Mail on Sunday - which said she had joked with Tory MPs about crossing and uncrossing her legs to distract Boris Johnson - as 'disgusting' and 'completely untrue'. Amid a storm of criticism on social media, Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle demanded a meeting with the newspaper's editor David Dillon. Mr Dillon rejected the call, saying that journalists should 'not take instruction' from parliamentary officials. Yesterday The Daily Telegraph reported that two Conservative MPs had told the newspaper they had heard Mrs Rayner laughing publicly about the idea that she could put off the Prime Minister by 'giving him a flash'. The witnesses said she had been joking about the suggestion that she was crossing and uncrossing her legs during a light-hearted discussion on the Commons terrace about two months ago. Separately, The Mail On Sunday has now spoken to a total of four Tory MPs - the original source and three others, including one woman - all of whom supported this account and contradicted the insinuation by Mrs Rayner and her allies that the claims were cooked up by sexists. One of the MPs, describing a night on the Commons terrace earlier this year, said Mrs Rayner had initiated the discussion of the issue. They said she had spoken of giving the Prime Minister 'a flash'. A second MP claimed that Mrs Rayner had referenced the thriller Basic Instinct, in which Sharon Stone's character infamously uncrosses her legs while being interrogated by police. 'Angela told us: 'I like to do my Sharon Stone trick to distract Boris... I cross and uncross my legs',' the witness said. A third MP added that they also remembered the encounter. The original source for the Mail on Sunday story said that the 'Sharon Stone' joke had been made while Mrs Rayner spoke to a Tory MP. 'She was telling him how she distracts Boris,' they said. All four Tories gave almost identical accounts of her remarks. They each said Mrs Rayner had used a startling slang colloquialism during the discussion. When The Mail on Sunday approached Mrs Rayner last Saturday about the exchanges on the terrace, a Labour spokesman said: 'It's completely made up, so unless they're going to say something properly on the record or have any evidence I would expect that this made-up story wouldn't run. 'I'm telling you categorically it's untrue so I'm afraid you know that doesn't meet the bar, an unnamed source without any evidence... I'm telling you, it's categorically untrue that this has happened.' After Mrs Rayner strenuously denied making the remarks, coverage of the story initially concentrated on allegations of sexism. The row then saw Sir Lindsay attempt to summon The Mail on Sunday's editor for a meeting. However, on Wednesday the Daily Mail revealed that Mrs Rayner had in fact publicly joked about the Basic Instinct comparison herself in January. Speaking to Matt Forde for his Political Party podcast, she volunteered the fact that her appearances in the Commons had prompted online references to the 1992 movie thriller. 'Every time I do a Prime Minister's Questions somebody has an opinion on what I wear. Did you see the meme about Sharon Stone like I was doing it at PMQs? I was mortified,' she said, laughing. 'I wasn't aware I did it but apparently there was this whole meme about how my dress was a bit revealing. I didn't think it was. It was a perfectly suitable Karen Millen - in the sale by the way.' The podcast also saw her use the same slang colloquialism MPs say she used on the Commons terrace. Meanwhile, as the backlash grew over Sir Lindsay's intervention, Mr Dillon formally turned down the Speaker's request for a meeting, saying that Britain's free Press would not endure if journalists had to take instructions from officials in the House of Commons. He also said other MPs had come forward to corroborate the original account of Mrs Rayner's remarks. The Prime Minister later backed Mr Dillon's decision. A No 10 spokesman said Mr Johnson would not want 'any perception of politicians seeking to in any way curb or control what a free Press seeks to report'. A spokesman for Mrs Rayner last night declined to comment further on the story. Labour's own partygate: Keir Starmer flouted Covid lockdown guidance at own birthday bash... with TWO cakes By Harriet Line, Chief Political Correspondent for the Daily Mail Sir Keir Starmer was last night accused of hypocrisy for attending a birthday cake celebration in his office during the pandemic. The Labour leader tucked into the shop-bought chocolate and lemon cakes while coronavirus guidance advised against holding close social gatherings indoors. Sir Keir has repeatedly demanded Boris Johnson quit for attending an impromptu birthday gathering in the Cabinet Room in June 2020 - just three months before his own celebration. The PM and Chancellor were hit with fines for breaking lockdown laws that banned indoor gatherings at that time. However, it has now emerged that Sir Keir was given a birthday card and two cakes in his office on his birthday in September 2020. While Covid laws on gatherings had been relaxed a month earlier, government guidance at the time stated that people should not 'hold or attend celebrations (such as parties) where it is difficult to maintain social distancing and avoid close social interaction'. 'This is the first time in the history of our country that a Prime Minister has been found to be in breach of the law, and then he lied repeatedly to the public about it. Britain deserves better, they have to go.' Sir Keir Starmer, April 12 'Now we know the Prime Minister did not shut down his own birthday party... he spent it breaking the law. We have a Prime Minister who is sorry only that he has been found out.' Angela Rayner, April 21 'We are all concerned by the situation in Ukraine, but that should not be used as a smokescreen for the failings of this Prime Minister.' MP Matt Western, April 21  The Government also said people should not 'socialise indoors in groups of more than two households'. It was not clear last night how many others helped Sir Keir to eat the cakes in his office.  A Tory source said: 'It now seems that, as well as sinking a few cold ones with mates at his infamous Durham drinks party, Sir Keir flouted the guidance in place for a little birthday bash... that is of course unless you believe that he popped out to a shop, bought himself a cake and sat alone eating it in his office. 'We know that Labour have lied about these things in the past so it makes you wonder what else they're hiding. The stench of hypocrisy gets stronger by the day.' Sir Keir claimed the Prime Minister and Chancellor 'dishonoured their office' by attending the impromptu birthday celebration on June 19, 2020, the day Mr Johnson turned 56. Rishi Sunak was in attendance because he had been invited to a crucial meeting about Covid. Mr Johnson was eating a salad. It was initially believed that the PM had been presented with a Union Jack cake while aides sang 'Happy Birthday' to him.  However, it has since emerged that the cake - bought by a special adviser - never even left its Tupperware box. Some sausage rolls from Marks and Spencer were laid out on the Cabinet table along with a few cans of Estrella lager, but it is believed that these too were left untouched.  Nevertheless, Sir Keir claimed Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak's attendance had 'dishonoured' the sacrifices made by people during lockdown - as well as their offices.  After the men were fined, Sir Keir said: 'This is the first time in the history of our country that a Prime Minister has been found to be in breach of the law, and then he lied repeatedly to the public about it. Britain deserves better, they [the PM and the Chancellor] have to go.'  Labour did not respond to a request for comment last night. However, a party source said no laws were broken.",
  "e69b5f6483db73e3139a2c7aca90fb4f10246f3446b4c1f675642b3a": "James Bulger's father has called for his killer to be stripped of his anonymity - while also revealing the killing is to be debated in Parliament. Jon Venables and Robert Thompson, both 10, killed two-year-old James Bulger in Merseyside in 1993. They were released on licence after serving eight years in secure children's units and were given life time anonymity. Venables, 39, has since been returned to prison twice for child abuse images and is still behind bars. But he has launched a bid for parole and could be freed later this year. Now, James' father Ralph has called for Venables to be stripped of his anonymity.  He has also called for a public inquiry, while revealing that a debate on the murder of his son and its aftermath is now being considered by the House of Commons' Petitions Committee. He said told the Mirror: 'A public inquiry is long overdue so we can flush out the truth about so many issues. 'But top of my list must be why Venables is still one of the very few people in this country who still has lifelong anonymity despite his repeated offending against children. 'I don't buy the argument that his life would be in danger. If that was the case, they would have to give secret identities to every child abuser and killer in the UK.' A petition in 2018 called for a Public Inquiry into the murder received over 210,000 signatures. However the government rejected the call but the Petitions Committee agreed MPs could discuss the issues in Parliament - which is now set to happen in 2022.  Mr Bulger said he wants a probe into the decision behind releasing the killers after just eight years and would like people to be made accountable. He also said that from 'day one' he thought the attack on his son had a sexual motive, and has also called for an investigation into the killers motives and separately about why his family were not given counselling after their son's death. Jon Venables and Robert Thompson were found guilty of killing Bulger in November 1993 and were freed in 2001, aged 18. They were given new identities to protect them from the risk of vigilante attacks and were made the subjects of so-called 'Mary Bell orders', lifetime anonymity court injunctions. At the time of Venables' first release from prison, a psychiatrist ruled that he did not pose a danger to the public and was extremely unlikely to commit any further offences. Years later it emerged Venables had been detained in Vardy House - a small eight-bed section of Red Bank secure unit in St Helens on Merseyside - where it's said he made such good progress he was kept there for eight years, despite it actually being a short-stay remand unit. Venables' release under his new identity went ahead and he is known to have been living independently by March 2002 - some time thereafter beginning a relationship with a woman who had a five-year-old child, although he denies having ever met them. He was then reported to have had a number of 'younger girlfriends' which suggested he was enjoying a delayed adolescence. He developed drinking and drugs problems, and he compromised his identity at least twice by telling friends he was a convicted murderer. In September 2008, he was arrested on suspicion of affray after a drunken brawl and was given a formal warning by the probation service for breaching the good behaviour terms of his licence. Later the same year, Venables was cautioned for possession of cocaine after he was found with a small amount of the class A drug. When a probation officer later visited his home in Cheshire to discuss his fears that he could be in danger, he was attempting to destroy the hard drive of his computer. The hard drive was later examined by police, who discovered that it contained dozens of indecent images of children. Venables admitted he had posed online as a 35-year-old woman who had abused her eight-year-old daughter, and was returned to prison. During his latest imprisonment he was given yet another new identity because of the risk posed by a previous security breach. Venables was paroled again in 2013 and took on his fourth new identity. He was sentenced to 40 months in prison after pleading guilty to having more than 1,000 indecent images of children, in February 2018. While Robert Thompson has not re-offended since being released on licence when he was 18 years old. Though in 2006, reports claimed Thompson was in a stable gay relationship at age 23 and had settled well into his local community in the North West.  The murder of James Bulger was a vicious crime that shocked Britain. Jon Venables and Robert Thompson were both 10 years old on February 12, 1993, when they abducted the two-year-old before brutally torturing and killing him. The crime made the boys the youngest killers in modern English history. The duo snatched James from outside a butcher's shop in Bootle, Merseyside, in 1993, while his mother popped into a store for just a few seconds. James' mutilated body was found on a railway line in Walton, Liverpool, two days later.  The boys were playing truant from school, and CCTV showed them observing local children at the shopping centre, appearing to be 'selecting a target'. They were then captured on camera taking the boy away at 3.42pm, before leading him on a two-and-a-half mile walk through Liverpool to the village of Walton. Venables and Thompson were seen by 38 people during the walk, and were twice challenged by bystanders because James was crying and had a bump on his forehead. But they were able to convince the concerned people that James was their little brother and continued on their way. They led James to a railway line near the disused Walton & Anfield Railway Station where they began torturing him - including throwing paint in his eye, pelting him with stones and bricks and dropping an iron bar on his head. After the body was found, police launched an appeal showing the low-resolution CCTV images of the boy. The breakthrough came when one woman recognised Venables, who she knew had skipped school with Thompson on that day, and contacted police. They were charged with murder on February 20 and forensic tests confirmed they had the same paint on their clothes as was found on James' body. Around 500 protesters turned out for their initial magistrates' court hearing due to the public outcry against the crime. The subsequent trial at Preston Crown Court and the boys were considered to be 'mature enough' to know they were doing something 'seriously wrong'. Venables and Thompson were found guilty on November 24, 1993, with the judge describing them as 'cunning and wicked'. Reporting restrictions on their names were also lifted as it was considered in the public interest to do so. Their parents were moved to different parts of the country and also received new identities due to death threats against them.  ",

A total of 86,100 visas had been issued by Wednesday, the Government said.  But as of Monday just 27,100 Ukrainians had arrived in the UK, according to figures from the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities and the Home Office.  This includes 11,110 through the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship route - 21.6 per cent of the 51,300 refugees with visas granted.  Around 16,000 have arrived under the Ukraine Family scheme - 45.8 per cent of the 34,900 refugees issued visas.  Overall, less than a third (31.4 per cent) of those granted visas under both schemes have arrived in the UK.  There are multiple cases where families are unable to travel to the UK because not all family members have received their permission to travel letters or visas.  There has also been widespread concern about the length of time it has taken for visas to be issued.  Home Office minister Kevin Foster said suggestions that Ukrainian children are deliberately not being granted visas to prevent their families from travelling to the UK are 'absolute nonsense'.  Speaking yesterday, he admitted that some individuals 'get a decision shortly after others in their party', adding: 'But that is not deliberate.' A government spokesman said: 'We are processing thousands of visas a day - this shows that the changes we made to streamline the service are working.'

The victim was attacked near the centre's food court and could not be saved despite emergency medical treatment provided by an air ambulance crew. Police believe it was a targeted attack. A police spokesman said: 'We have started a murder investigation following the death of a man in Thurrock. 'We were called to reports of a man injured after a serious assault inside the Lakeside shopping centre shortly before 4.30pm today.

Andrew Fahie, 51, who also serves as the territory's minister of finance, was detained in Miami for money laundering and conspiring to import a controlled drug.  Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said she was 'appalled by these serious allegations', which also follow an inquiry into embezzlement by officials. She said last night: 'I have spoken to the governor of the British Virgin Islands (the Queen's representative in the territory) and he will be holding an emergency meeting of the territory's cabinet... He will set out next steps (today), including urgent publication of the inquiry's report.'  In September 2021, Fahie backed a 'self-determination' referendum that could see the Queen's removal as the British Virgin Islands' head of state.  The move came after then Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab ordered an inquiry into allegations that party officials had embezzled taxpayer money sent to help the islands in the wake of hurricanes.  The independent probe was announced in January 2021. 'The BVI is not corrupt', Mr Fahie said at the time.  'Anyone that makes that statement is trying to damage the BVI's reputation, and is an irresponsible person.'  Mr Rankin said last night: 'I realise this will be shocking news for people in the territory. I would call for calm at this time.'",

Daniel Stilitz QC, who is believed to be a Labour member himself, deleted his social media account yesterday after his anti-government posts were widely shared online. Critics accused Mr Stilitz of not showing due impartiality given his high-profile role advising Miss Gray on her much-anticipated report into alleged illegal gatherings at Downing Street during the pandemic. In other posts, Remain-supporting Mr Stilitz, of 11KBW chambers in London, said Labour MPs backing a Brexit deal were 'mugs' and retweeted a post calling Boris Johnson 'our reckless dangerous PM'. In another post, he said: 'Why not join Labour? Now seems as good a time as any.' Commenting on Brexit in 2019, he said: 'The future of the UK is collateral damage in this mad Tory fight to the death.' News website Guido Fawkes reported that another post made that year stated: 'The Government's current rhetoric is nothing compared to the bile they'll serve up during the forthcoming election campaign.' Mr Stilitz deleted his Twitter account yesterday after the comments were widely shared online. Last night a spokesman for the Cabinet Office, which will deliver Miss Gray's report, said: 'The judgments in both the update and the final report are hers alone, to establish the facts under the published terms of reference of the inquiry.

  "38ca7eedc27ba09e8c7610d96bf510345ef77c4023318a34ec9635a2": "  Priti Patel has hailed the passing by Parliament of a landmark law that she vows will finally fix Britain's 'broken' asylum system. Writing in the Daily Mail, the Home Secretary says the Nationality and Borders Act will crack down on 'evil' people-smugglers facilitating dangerous Channel crossings. And she adds that 'for far too long, the public has been branded racist simply for wanting controlled borders'.  Her comments come after the bill finally received royal assent yesterday, having survived attempts by peers to reject key measures including the processing of refugee claims offshore. The latest data suggests no migrants have arrived by small boat for the past ten days, after the military took charge of stopping crossings earlier this year. But the Government's deal to send asylum seekers to Rwanda is facing court challenges, as is a plan to house 1,500 asylum seekers at an old RAF base in Yorkshire, despite Miss Patel insisting they will be helped to start a 'prosperous' new life in Africa. The Home Secretary writes: 'Daily Mail readers don't need to be told that the asylum system is broken.  'They can see the evidence with their own eyes: evil people-smugglers bringing migrants here illegally in small boats and on lorries; dangerous foreign criminals doing all they can to avoid being deported by putting in last-minute, meritless claims hours before they are due on the plane.' She says the plans will speed up the process for dealing with those who claim asylum in Britain. Miss Patel insists a new law was required to increase the maximum sentence for entering the country illegally from six months to four years, as well as introduce a life sentence for people-smugglers. And failed asylum seekers and foreign criminals will be removed more quickly rather than being allowed to make appeal claims up until their deportation flights. Our plan is firm, fair, and delivers on YOUR priorities By Home Secretary Priti Patel  Daily Mail readers don't need to be told the asylum system is broken. They can see the evidence with their own eyes: evil people-smugglers bringing migrants here illegally in small boats and on lorries; dangerous foreign criminals doing all they can to avoid being deported by putting in last-minute, meritless claims hours before they are due on the plane. It's been obvious for decades that things need to change. And the British people have made it clear that's how they feel. That's why I developed the New Plan for Immigration. A fair and firm system is one of the people's priorities. To put the whole plan into practice, we needed to change the law. This week, the Nationality and Borders Act completed its passage through Parliament. The maximum sentence for entering the country illegally will rise from six months to four years. And the smugglers who bring them here can now be sentenced to life in prison. Instead of a maximum sentence of six months, foreign criminals who return to the UK in breach of a deportation order may face up to five years in prison. Asylum reception centres - which are already in place in many European countries - will be used to process claims, rather than hotels. We will open one such centre in Yorkshire. One of the things that most angers people is that claims take so long. We are taking steps to improve the process, but we also need to stop the number of repeat appeals and judicial reviews - all too often aimed at delaying the removals process and usually without merit. We can now deliver proper scientific assessment processes to prevent adults from getting away with pretending to be children. Those we are seeking to remove, including foreign national offenders, will be required to present all their claims upfront, rather than raising them at the last minute. The UK keeps a list of safe countries that respect human rights, to stop people delaying removal by falsely claiming their human rights are at risk. Every EU country is on that list. We will have the power to remove as well as add countries - to ensure the list is reliable. Countries must co-operate in taking back citizens with no right to be in the UK. Those that don't will risk losing access to our visa system. For the first time, how a person arrives in the UK will affect the outcome of their claim. Anyone who arrives illegally and has passed through a safe country may be deemed inadmissible. A few weeks ago I signed a migration and economic development partnership with Rwanda, which will mean those who make dangerous journeys in small boats, or in the backs of lorries, could have their asylum claim processed in Rwanda. If their claims are accepted, they will be supported to build a new and prosperous life there. By tackling illegal migration, we will be able to focus our resources on people who genuinely need our help, such as those from Ukraine. The British people have welcomed them warmly, as they have with refugees throughout our history. For far too long, the public has been branded racist simply for wanting border controls. Yet only by controlling immigration can we do right by those who don't have the money to pay people-smugglers. It also isn't fair on British taxpayers that the broken asylum system costs PS1.5billion a year - and nearly PS5million a day in hotels. We have not reached the end of the road to reform. There is no single solution to solve a long-standing problem. There will be opposition in the courts. But we have a New Plan for Immigration that is firm and fair. And the Nationality and Borders Act means we have the law on our side.",

More than 40,000 Brits reported problems with the service just before 10pm on Thursday - with similar reports made by countless others around the world.  The cause of the problem is unclear but some users have reported being unable to connect to the service.  Others said they couldn't send messages, while some said the app simply wasn't loading.  Baffled users took to Twitter to complain about the outage.  It appeared to affect users across the UK, while foreign-language data sites also reported problems.  Most of the issues were reported in London, Manchester and Birmingham. More than 500 million people use WhatsApp, which is owned by Mark Zuckerberg's Meta.  Reacting to the issues, one user wrote: 'Yes WhatsApp is down again.' Another revealed: 'Me realizing WhatsApp is down after restarting my WiFi 50 times and uninstalling the app 6 times.' WhatsApp tweeted: 'You may be experiencing some issues using WhatsApp at the moment. 'We're aware and working to get things running smoothly again. We'll keep you updated and in the meantime, thanks for your patience.' Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp were all brought down for almost seven hours last year in a massive global outage.

  "77e494d7bd7f951c1a1d6a55d51e30c5349c9cb832b110ff4f917849": "Police have released an image of the moment a masked killer who knifed a hero father to death in front of his 15-year-old son brandishes a huge knife moments before the fatal attack. Football coach Michael Fadayomi, 40, described as a 'pillar of the community', was stabbed in the neck trying to protect his son from rampaging thug Marcus Griffiths. After telling a fellow bus passenger he wanted to 'f****** kill someone', Griffiths, 43, followed the boy and a friend in Willesden, north west London, when he suddenly launched his unprovoked attack. The teenager managed to dodge the knife directed at his head twice and he and his friend ran off, calling Mr Fadayomi for help.  But the fight spilled into the nearby Grill King Shop and Mr Fadayomi was repeatedly knifed - including a fatal wound to his neck that cut an artery and caused massive blood loss. Griffiths then calmly made off from the murder scene after the 'cowardly attack', prosecutors said. Paramedics were called but Mr Fadayomi died in front of his son.  Griffiths was today jailed for life for a minimum term of 32 years at Harrow Crown Court. The unprovoked attacks began when Griffiths followed the schoolboys off the bus after they sat next to him and he suddenly turned aggressive for 'no reason'. The youngster managed to avoid two blows aimed at his head and ran from the bus stop to call his father. When 'much-loved father' and 'pillar of the community', Mr Fadayomi who lived nearby, arrived just after 5pm he went to the top deck of the bus to remonstrate with Griffiths. But as Mr Fadayomi got off and started walking down the road, Griffiths chased after him and repeatedly stabbed him from behind as he walked away and severed an artery in his neck. Police said the vicious assault was carried out for 'absolutely no reason at all' and that Mr Fadayomi was unarmed and had not shown any aggression towards the attacker. A witness who sat near Griffiths on the bus heard him say 'I'm going to kill someone today'. Griffiths was arrested later the same evening at his home not far away in Cricklewood, north west London, and denied knowing anything about the killing. CCTV footage and witness statements revealed that within moments of boarding the bus, and without provocation, Griffiths became aggressive towards the two boys. At the next stop - which was Willesden Bus Garage - they all got off the bus and the attack was unleashed. During the trial, Griffiths claimed he was acting in self-defence when he knifed Mr Fadayomi to death. But at Harrow Crown Court, Griffiths was found guilty by a jury of murder after a two-week trial. He was also convicted of the attempted murder of Mr Fadayomi's 15-year-old son and possessing a knife in public. Today at the same court he was sentenced to life in prison, with a minimum term of 32 years for murder and a minimum of 22 years for attempted murder. Kristen Katsouris, a senior crown prosecutor in the homicide unit for the CPS in London, said after the sentencing hearing today: 'This was an attack on a father who was looking out for his teenage son. 'Michael Fadayomi had simply wanted to protect his child and in doing so he lost his life. No child should have to witness the death of their parent in such cruel circumstances. 'Marcus Griffiths got off the bus and attacked Mr Fadayomi with a knife. And yet, during the trial Griffiths claimed that he had been acting in self-defence. 'When faced with the evidence, the jury were able to see through this story. 'The prosecution case included DNA evidence, video footage of the fatal incident and testimony from passengers on the bus who had witnessed Griffiths' aggressive demeanour beforehand. 'A family has lost a father, son and brother and although nothing can bring their loved one back, I hope these convictions and the sentence handed out today provides some sense of justice to the family of Mr Fadayomi. Our thoughts remain with them at this time.' Detective Constable Rebecca Corser, the investigating officer for the Met Police, said Fadayomi's son only narrowly avoided being killed himself. She added: 'This is a tragic case in which a man has lost his life for absolutely no reason at all. 'For a reason known only to himself, Marcus Griffiths was intent on causing serious harm to someone that day. Indeed, a witness who sat near him on the bus heard him say 'I'm going to kill someone today'. 'Michael Fadayomi's son and his friend had the misfortune to sit near him on the bus and he turned his aggression towards them. 'After his son narrowly avoided being killed himself, Michael came to the scene and confronted Griffiths about his behaviour. 'Michael was not armed and did not show any physical aggression towards Griffiths. In a cowardly attack, Griffiths stabbed him from behind as he was walking away from the bus. 'I would like to offer my sincerest condolences to the Fadayomi family. Nothing can be done to bring back a much-loved father, however I am glad the jury has seen through Griffiths' lies and he will now spend many years in jail.'",
  "dba8ec9dcf72cc972f3994d2e8401751759c0a484a33d4d18f13d026": "Emotional viewers took to social media to heap praise on Julia Bradbury for sharing the 'vulnerable moments' throughout her cancer battle as she bravely went topless after her mastectomy in a new documentary. The TV veteran, 51, moved fans to tears as she gave a powerful insight into her double mastectomy and breast reconstruction surgery in the ITV documentary Breast Cancer And Me, which aired on Thursday night. Viewers took to Twitter to praise Julia for sharing her 'most personal and vulnerable moments' in the 'inspirational' documentary, which saw her go topless to show new breast implant after her mastectomy. Julia, who underwent the operation and an immediate reconstruction in October after being diagnosed with breast cancer last year, showed fans the intimate moment she looked at her breast implant for the first time in the mirror. In the documentary, she admitted that the implant would take 'some getting used to' as she showed where the silicone was visible beneath her skin and spoke about the struggles of losing her breast. She admitted that she struggled to initially look at her new breast, only catching brief glimpses in the shower, saying she wanted to wait to look in the mirror until 'I was emotionally ready and when I'd physically had some time to heal'. Undoing her bra and looking at her new implant, a visibly emotional Julia said: 'There you go, there's my new boob. Ok well it looks like a boob. It looks like a big lumpy boob. 'Can't feel that at all, it might come back one day, the sensation, but I can't feel my fingertips. It looks like a plasticine boob at the moment. It's going to take a bit of getting used to.' Taking to Twitter to speak about the documentary, fans admitted they were in 'floods of tears' as they watched her breast cancer journey, praising her 'bravery' for openly sharing her journey in the powerful documentary. One viewer wrote: 'Oh Julia, your programme has me in floods of tears within moments. You're so brave to show everyone your journey. Wishing you all the love.' Another commented: 'Such an honest, powerful documentary. Julia thank you for sharing your most personal, vulnerable moments in your breast cancer journey.' A third said: 'Watching @JuliaBradbury what a brave, strong lady filming your journey! Wishing you a speedy and full recovery god bless you xx' A fourth tweeted: 'Watching the documentary. You are an inspiration. What a fantastic woman you are. Brave is an understatement.' A fifth added: '@JuliaBradbury touched by your cancer journey. Thank you for being strong enough to share so openly.' A sixth wrote: 'Incredibly brave and open of Julia Bradbury in this documentary. Hoping she recovers and there's a good ending to this sad story.' And another gushed: 'Currently watching your programme about breast cancer with tears streaming down my face. You are such an amazing, brave woman.  'Thank you for sharing your story and for being so open and honest. I hope your recovery goes well and you are able to return to full health.' Earlier in the documentary, Julia bravely went topless to show where her breasts had been marked with felt tip ahead of her double mastectomy. The markings were made for the surgeon performing her mastectomy and the Countryfile presenter bravely spoke to the camera while sitting on a hospital bed ahead of the operation. On the verge of tears, she said: 'The process of being marked up, you do feel a bit like a slab of meat. I've been pretty strong today, I haven't cried today and I've cried most days while this has been going on but today - it's a bit overwhelming the whole thing.' Elsewhere in the documentary, Julia tearfully detailed how she had to say goodbye to her children three days before her mastectomy and how she struggled with losing her breast in her new documentary, Breast Cancer And Me. She explained that due to coronavirus restrictions she was unable to see her kids and husband Joe Cunningham before the operation, as she opened up about her experience and recalled how her children asked her if her condition was 'contagious like Covid'. Mother of three Julia has candidly shared her journey with ITV viewers after first learning she had cancer in September last year, admitting that she 'didn't feel she had a choice' about going public with the diagnosis. During her experience, Julia filmed a video diary and explained how she had to hold her children for the last time three days before the surgery, she said: 'I started self-isolating this morning. I took all my kids to school and waved goodbye at the gates. Then we all knew that I wouldn't be able to hug them again until after the operation. 'It's an extra layer of complication that makes this horrible process even s****er. I don't mind saying that I'm scared now and now it's real dread that I'm feeling. You hope it's a dream and you're wrong.' The hour-long documentary opened with Julia filming a woodland segment for This Morning, when she was awaiting the results of a recent biopsy - but she refused to take the call while away from home because there was nobody she felt 'close to' that would be able to support her. Julia said: 'I was away with a new team, up trees and there were emails back and forth about when I could take this call to hear the results of a biopsy I'd had done a week before, on a lump in my left breast. 'I knew I wouldn't be able to take the call because I wasn't prepared for it to be bad news and I wasn't with someone I knew, to be able to ask to take some time out to process it. After waiting to take the call at home, Julia recalls how she was told their was a 'big tumour' in her left breast, adding: 'So I thought I'd delay that until I was back. I was ready for the call and I was here at home, it was a sunny day and my consultant called and said you do have cancer. And it's a big tumour.' Julia, who shares her kids - Zephyr, 10, and twins Xanthe and Zena, both seven, with husband Joe Cunningham, kept her diagnosis hidden for a while because she didn't want her children to hear the news from anyone else. She said: 'When you hear the words 'you've got cancer', your world stops. It is like moving instantly into slow motion. Just thought s**t, okay, I've got to live. I need and want to be here. 'I didn't want the information about my breast cancer to be out there before I told my children, I didn't want them to hear mummy's got cancer from someone else. I kept it to myself until I made sure everything was right at home with my family.' Julia and her husband 'came to parenthood late in their lives', and welcomed their son when she was 40 years old and then their twin daughters through IVF three years later.  Explaining that it broke her heart to consider leaving her children, Julia said: 'The most painful thing of it all was my children and the thought of leaving them behind. The most joyful thing about motherhood is watching them develop. 'They're at these gorgeous ages where every day is a little landmark. One of my little girls [Zena] is very shy, so watching her overcome something at school, every moment with her when she puts her hand up against her instincts.' 'My little boy Zeph is a little bit cheeky which we love, Xanthe is a little chatter boy, you think are you ever going to stop talking? You have these gorgeous moments with them when they're little. This makes a cancer diagnosis - for me - just made it so so sad.' Julia also revealed that when she told her husband Joe, he was 'devastated' but told her that they would get through it and be able to look after the children. The Countryfile host went on to discuss how the couple told their children about her diagnosis and admitted that although they didn't want to say she would die - they didn't want to lie to them either. She explained: 'We decided to take them for a walk around the garden - because that's where they feel comfortable and happy - and just be honest with them. Say that mummy's not very well and mention the cancer word. 'I remember my little girl - I'll try not to cry, said 'Can I still hug you. I was like yes of course you can, I want you to hug me tighter. One of the hardest things in my life was telling my children I've got cancer.' Julia went on to explain how the next step of her journey was working out a treatment plan with doctors, of what and when they can operate. At this point Julia was told she was going to have a mastectomy. She said: 'They said if we take away the breast tissue we might be able to save your skin and nipple. That word - amputation of the breast - it's shocking, it's absolutely shocking. 'I was told that it was possible for me to have reconstruction at the time of my mastectomy because of the type of cancer I have. As long as the tumour could be removed safely. I was told the tumour is probably contained and we'll be able to take it out in one, we don't know its spread so we'll take out a lymph node to check. Admitting she was shocked by the news, Julia said: 'A silicone implant? What's that going to look like, how's that going to feel? And then you're like 'f****', wow.' Julia was told by a nurse during filming that she would need to take six weeks off for recovery because it is a 'big operation'. Detailing how the consultation made her feel, she said: 'You just don't have any idea of how this is going to unravel, you're really in the dark about how you're going to feel, emotionally and physically.' Julia described the feelings of loneliness, and said: 'You think about, chemotherapy, losing parts of your body, has the cancer spread? For someone who is in control, you feel alone and helpless. The mother of three explained that her mum Chrissi, 84, has previously battled bowl cancer and her father Michael, 81, has survived prostate cancer. She has previously told how she believes the birth of her first born Zeph saved the lives of her parents who 'pulled through' to meet her little boy. Julia said she didn't tell her parents for a while and explained why: 'I knew if I just told her look I've been for this biopsy, and it's some sort of cancer but I don't know what yet. To my mum that's like a death sentence.  'Her mind would go and she'd want to come and live with me straight away and come to every single appointment. Which is lovely, but for her own health, she's in her 80s and had her own stuff going on.' The documentary then sees Julia cooking in the kitchen with her mother, who tells the camera that she has come even though her daughter didn't want her to, because she 'couldn't stay away any longer'. When asked how it feels knowing Julia has cancer, Chrissi said: 'It's like having it all over again to be honest, and I do believe that the worst thing is now waiting. I am now looking forward to recovery. When you recover you have to stop working, you've got to stop rushing about. It's important to prepare your body for what's going to happen.' The mother and daughter are then seen sharing an emotional embrace, before Chrissi said: 'When she told us she had been diagnosed I was shell shocked, I can't tell you how I felt. I didn't even know myself and still don't. If someone had said can you take it away from her and you have it, I'd of said yes. While her Dad added: 'It did help that Julia tackled it head on my coming to see us, we can't put ourselves in her shoes. We don't know when she's feeling scared or vulnerable. All we can do is be there and provide whatever you can.' Household name Julia, who has been on British TV screens since 1996, went on to admit that she 'didn't feel she had a choice' about going public with her breast cancer diagnosis. She said: 'I wanted to give an open and honest account of what I was going through. The statistic is one in seven women will get breast cancer in their lifetime. It's the club nobody wants to be in. I suppose like most members of this club, I didn't think I'd get in.' In a video entry 10 days before her surgery, Julia said: 'It feels like I'm part of some really bad game show. Like the hunger games or something. Even though this op is hopefully going to get rid of the cancer, fingers crossed it hasn't spread. 'It's hopefully going to save me, I feel my hand moving to my boob and holding it - knowing it's not going to be or feel the same again. You're really scared, shocked and frightened, and loss.' Following her diagnosis, Julia decided to return to her woodland documentary filming for the final time before her operation, and speaking in the voiceover she said she hopes she doesn't come across as a 'blubbering wreck' while filming live for This Morning. A producer can be seen on the woodland set telling Julia that the majority of the segment will focus on the forestry, but the presents may ask how she is at the end. Sharing her vulnerability before the show airs, Julia said: 'If you asked ten people what they thought of Julia, five would say annoying, brash and all of that stuff. Others would say positive, loud, energetic, determined... but not vulnerable, scared.. those would not be some of the adjectives used. I'm not used to that I suppose. Even to my family I don't like to show that side.' Julia filmed the segment with hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield.  Back in the woods, Julia can be seen discussing the upcoming interview with host Holly Wil who kindly told her: 'We're going to say are you okay - you can answer whatever you want, we're not going to push.' Julia added: 'You talk about things a different way on camera, its as if you're talking about someone else and you're looking at them and feeling sorry for them. But that other person is me. So it's weird place to be in.' The following scene showed Julia in hospital - accompanied by her older sister Gina - as a nurse marked up where the surgeon needed to remove a lymph node to check if the cancer has spread. Julia looked tearful as they completed the mark up on the location of her nearest lymph node, so that they were able to easily locate it when they operated the following day. She later said during a confessional that she felt the experience tipped her over the edge because it was a reminder of what the surgeons would be doing to her the following day.  She explained: 'I felt suddenly overwhelmed then when she exposed my breast. I just thought that's what's going to happen tomorrow morning. That was just a bit more emotional than I thought it would be. It's my last day of being me and having my full body and boobs.  'When I lay down and she exposed my breast, I'm not shy it's not about body image, I just thought when she did it and started touching about that area, that's what they're going to be doing tomorrow. Chopping it open and taking it away, taking the cancer away but changing me forever. 'My surgeon has been in and marked up my body, you feel like you've been tattooed a bit, he explained that he just wants to get the symmetry right because when you lay down it looks different. It's a weird process. 'I've been pretty strong today, I don't think I've cried today. I've cried most days while this has been going on. But today I'm a bit, it's overwhelming, but for all the women who have gone through it and will go through it, this is the best possible thing to get me through to the other side.' In a happier scene, Julia was seen reuniting with her two daughters after she returned home from hospital, who she hadn't spoken to since leaving as they thought a video call while away may have been upsetting. She said: 'I'm back home, I've had a little nap and my girls have come home from school, and I'm going to surprise them - with cuddles on the bed! 'This is the longest time I've ever gone without seeing them, we didn't video call while I was in hospital because I didn't want to scare them. Julia then started to cry with happiness at seeing her girls again, as she told them to be gentle with her as she showed them the supportive bra she has to wear for a while during her recovery. A few weeks into her recovery, Julia admitted she hadn't yet looked at her new breast while it was 'angry and sore', and was yet to stand in front of a mirror to properly inspect the implant. Julia said: 'I wanted it to be when I felt emotionally ready and physically I had some time to heal. After revealing her new breast she said: 'Okay well it looks like a boob, like a big lumpy boob.' Touching it, she added: 'I can't feel that at all, it might come back one day the sensation. But strangely I can't feel my fingertips at all. It looks like a PlasterScene boob at the moment. It's going take a bit of getting used to.' During the post operative consultation, the consultant told her the whole tumour was removed was taken but she has 'potential micro invasion'. After admitting she had felt 'very, very nervous' that morning, Julia is told that the whole area was exorcised and they wouldn't be considering any invasive treatment such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy. He went on to explain that there was a small area of 'potential micro invasion', which means a small amount of cells had spilled into the substance of the breast and he told her to consider a preventative drug, but it isn't without risks, which include flushing and sweating and aggravating endometriosis as well as rarely inducing tumours in the lining of the womb. Julia admitted she was scared of her cancer 'reoccurring' as she detailed the next steps of her journey. She said: 'I wish I could say I've had my mastectomy and the prognosis is really good and I can just get on with my life now, but the reality is that there is a chance of the breast cancer coming back. The reoccurrence risk is the thing that hangs over me. 'I will be throwing myself into research about my kind of cancer, so I'm peeing on sticks and spitting into tubes, having bloods and speaking to as many people as possible about everything related.' The results of a sophisticated 'SNIPS' test revealed that Julia currently does not need to consider having her right breast removed, as she is told by a professional that she is not 'high risk' for secondary cancer. Reflecting on the news, Julia said: 'The most important thing is not to get cancer again. The period of time is usually five years. My children are 10 and six, they're babies. Five years is nothing in their lives. I need to live more than five years. 'When people talk about recovery and the treatment is good, the survival is good. I don't think there's enough emphasis on what recovery is. On what handling breast cancer is all about. I'm trying to learn to handle that. 'I have a lot to process and a lot to really understand now I'm post mastectomy, I have to learn to love my new breast and get physically fit again. I really want to know how to deal with the future, the question mark of reoccurrence.' During a therapy session, she confessed: 'It's still very fresh, coming to terms with it all. Your body and life changes in a few weeks. So I sit here as a new person, with a new bit. I've lost a bit of me as well.' 'I do also think about other ladies going through this who have had a worse or more aggressive diagnosis than me. That makes me sad, I feel like I should be very grateful for where I am and my cancer experience.' 'Everyone around me, family, partner, parents, loved ones.. it's crashed into their lives as well. I feel sad that I've brought this into their lives.' Julia, who explained that she is starting to feel sensation again in her breast, told how her little boy had asked her if the cancer was 'contagious like Covid'. She said: 'I was reading to him in bed and he said to me, is it contagious mummy - like Covid? I said no sweetheart, it's this different thing. He'd obviously been thinking about it. We've all been going through it together and it's hard to know as a parent if you're getting it right. Talking to them about cancer in the right way, what is the right way?' Towards the end of the episode, Julia attended a session with her children and other families which helps them to understand more about the condition. She then spoke about how she plans to move forward in the future, and said: 'How is this going to affect them in five, ten years time - I can't answer that right now. But I hope we've handled it pretty well. I hope I'm still alive in ten years to ask them the question. But you just do the best you can. 'There's still disbelief that I'm in that room with those mums and parents as one of them. Cancer is a lifetime diagnosis, it's not dealt with after treatment. You need to learn to deal with it for the rest of your life. That's a big learning curve for me. 'Cancer has put me on a different footings, it's completely changed my life. Life is incredible precious. I have three amazing children I have to live for. I want to take this horrible thing that has happened and turn it into something positive. The simple and small and ordinary things are the most important things.' On Thursday's episode of This Morning Julia and Holly Willoughby were moved to tears as they discussed Julia telling her children about her breast cancer. The Countryfile star told how difficult it was to tell her children about her cancer battle, with one asking her if the disease is 'contagious'. She said: 'Telling your children you have cancer is the hardest thing you will ever have to do in your life you have to be realistic but protect them and I don't think any parent knows what to do.  'One of my children said, 'Can I still hug you?' and the other said, 'Is it contagious?' I never thought about either of those two things.  'You just don't know what's going through their mind. You do your best, but it's a very difficult thing to navigate.'   Julia added her kids have been 'amazing', saying: 'They've made friends with my new boob! They say, 'Mummy, it doesn't feel the same' and I say, 'No it doesn't, but I'm here and that's what it's done.'' Julia also explained she didn't tell her mum the diagnosis until she knew herself what the plans were for treatment, because she knew she would worry so much. She said: 'My mum is a Greek-living. gorgeous, warm parent who tries to protect us to this day. 'I have to phone her when I get somewhere I knew if I told her she would want to know what was happening next she would want to move in with me, I knew it would be a huge worry for her at that stage.'  Julia encourages women to get themselves checked if they find a lump or notice a change in their body.   She said: 'I've been honest about the discovery of my lump from the very beginning because I've always been a campaigner for cancer.  'My mother had cancer, my father had cancer, so I've been an ambassador for several cancer charities throughout my career and ironically I am an ambassador for ovarian cancer in the UK.' She added: 'But when I did discover the lump, I was very open about having mammograms and encouraging women to go to the doctor if you find something - trust your instincts and I even posted a picture on my social media accounts of me having a mammogram. It was just a natural progression from that. 'I even posted a picture of me having my mammogram and it was just a natural progression for that, it just seemed like the right thing to do. 'I know that by being open for this people know I am there with them and it has broken down some stigma by talking about it.'   Julia admitted she often thinks about 'five-year terms' since her diagnosis. She said: 'It's completely unbelievable until you're in that situation you don't know how you're going to react. You immediately think about death...there are very few people who live through a cancer diagnosis and never think about it again. 'You think about five-year terms, when you talk about survival rates that's what you're talking about...what about living with the reality of cancer which is you will never be able to forget it.   Julia recently said she was unsure whether she would ever travel or wear a bikini again following her breast cancer diagnosis. She spoke to Hello! magazine from Mauritius where she was on holiday with her partner Gerry and their children., She said: 'I have this feeling of embracing everything now, grabbing everything that life has to offer with open arms. 'I wasn't sure that I would ever travel again - and certainly wasn't sure whether I'd wear a bikini ever again.' Julia added she had always appreciated the 'healing power of nature' and did so even more now. 'I'm still at the acute end of coming through my diagnosis and coming to terms with everything, so life is very heightened,' she said. 'The skies are a deeper shade of blue, the patterns of nature are more striking than usual. I'm taking it all in.' The broadcaster said she was using her illness as an opportunity to 'reset' her emotional and physical health and now practises meditation and gratitude every day, sleeps at least eight hours each night and has cut out almost all alcohol. She added: 'It will be a long time before you find me dancing on tables again - and I love dancing on tables.' Julia also told how she had promised at the beginning of the holiday to agree to any of her children's requests, from swimming to trekking or eating ice cream but only one a day. She added: 'They are this size for such a short time: you blink and they're gone. 'I want to enjoy every one of those moments and they're even more magnified and precious now.'   It comes after Julia wore a bikini for the first time since undergoing the procedure, as she holidayed in Mauritius, and admitted she feels 'fortunate' to have had immediate breast reconstruction. The TV personality took to Instagram where she shared a gorgeous shot of herself in a blue bikini and beach cover-up in matching print, while relaxing in the sunshine   Julia penned: 'I had no idea what life after a #mastectomy would be like. I feel incredibly grateful that some things have gone my way during my #breastcancer diagnosis. Each of our stories is different... 'I was fortunate to be able to have immediate recon after my breast was removed containing a 6cm tumour.   'Nothing prepares you for the shock & impact...& yet but here I am in a bikini again. Didn't think this would happen. 'Wearing wraps helps too. Of course it's @melissaodabash!! Thanks @gaylerinkoff for finding me new. #gratitude #breastcancer #recovery #bikini #mauritius.'   Her holiday snap comes after Julia revealed that the risk of her cancer is returning is higher than average and detailed her experience learning to love her body after a mastectomy in a candid chat. Six months after undergoing her surgery, the presenter is now having to come to terms with the knowledge that she does not yet have the 'all clear' from doctors. Julia revealed to You magazine that she has 'micro-invasions' - tiny fragments of cancerous cells which have leached out of her milk duct and into her breast tissue. Furthermore, genetic testing has shown that she has a higher than average risk of her cancer coming back.   She explained: 'I'm in the top five or six per cent of women in the country in terms of the likelihood of recurrence. 'That puts me in the 'moderate risk' category - higher than the average woman - but, look, it's about percentages and perspectives. 'The doctors have not found a huge spread of an aggressive cancer. I have lost my breast but been able to have an implant and keep my own nipple. 'I feel lucky and grateful every single day, and I have to learn to live with this risk, to accept the fragility of life, without it consuming me.' Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. Each year in the UK there are more than 55,000 new cases, and the disease claims the lives of 11,500 women. In the US, it strikes 266,000 each year and kills 40,000. But what causes it and how can it be treated? What is breast cancer? Breast cancer develops from a cancerous cell which develops in the lining of a duct or lobule in one of the breasts. When the breast cancer has spread into surrounding breast tissue it is called an 'invasive' breast cancer. Some people are diagnosed with 'carcinoma in situ', where no cancer cells have grown beyond the duct or lobule. Most cases develop in women over the age of 50 but younger women are sometimes affected. Breast cancer can develop in men though this is rare. Staging means how big the cancer is and whether it has spread. Stage 1 is the earliest stage and stage 4 means the cancer has spread to another part of the body. The cancerous cells are graded from low, which means a slow growth, to high, which is fast growing. High grade cancers are more likely to come back after they have first been treated. What causes breast cancer? A cancerous tumour starts from one abnormal cell. The exact reason why a cell becomes cancerous is unclear. It is thought that something damages or alters certain genes in the cell. This makes the cell abnormal and multiply 'out of control'. Although breast cancer can develop for no apparent reason, there are some risk factors that can increase the chance of developing breast cancer, such as genetics. What are the symptoms of breast cancer? The usual first symptom is a painless lump in the breast, although most breast lumps are not cancerous and are fluid filled cysts, which are benign.  The first place that breast cancer usually spreads to is the lymph nodes in the armpit. If this occurs you will develop a swelling or lump in an armpit. How is breast cancer diagnosed? If you are confirmed to have breast cancer, further tests may be needed to assess if it has spread. For example, blood tests, an ultrasound scan of the liver or a chest x-ray. How is breast cancer treated? Treatment options which may be considered include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormone treatment. Often a combination of two or more of these treatments are used. How successful is treatment? The outlook is best in those who are diagnosed when the cancer is still small, and has not spread. Surgical removal of a tumour in an early stage may then give a good chance of cure. The routine mammography offered to women between the ages of 50 and 70 mean more breast cancers are being diagnosed and treated at an early stage.

  "18eacec09f11a1cd9a3f2ee2c8067845820ca07d9a920b5a8ce87cb9": "Premier League Productions, the top flight's international broadcaster, has axed a number of reporters and presenters in a radical overhaul that has left them open to allegations of 'rank hypocrisy'. In a huge shake-up, a number of full-time staff and freelancers were 'brutally' told their services would no longer be needed via a series of Zoom calls, insiders have disclosed. From next season the broadcaster is moving away from their normal offering of studio news and analysis shows and moving to what has been described as 'timeless, digital content'. That means that a number of well-known faces, along with production crews, camera operators and logistics staff have been told that they are not having their contracts renewed or that their hours will be drastically reduced. 'A lot of people who work four, five days a week have been told they won't be required next season, or possibly just for matchdays and pressers,' one source explained. They added that many 'saw the iceberg coming' at a mass Zoom call when the shift in programming was announced. That was followed up by further calls to the many who had been impacted to outline a bleak future. 'It was brutal,' they said. Another insider also hit out. 'The way that longstanding staff have been treated is absolutely outrageous,' they said.  'It's rank hypocrisy. There are vast amounts sloshing around the Premier League and yet staff are treated like this. Some good people stitched up. It's not right.' PLP, as it is known, is run by IMG Media for the Premier League.  A joint-operation, it produces and distributes all of the Premier League's international programming, including the broadcasting of all 380 Premier League matches. The likes of Kelly Cates, James Richardson, Seema Jaswal and Mark Pougatch have all worked on studio productions for the broadcaster. An IMG spokesman said: 'Premier League Productions aims to deliver the best possible programming output for international broadcasters and football fans around the world.  'Together with the Premier League, we regularly review our content portfolio and are evolving our offering for the next season.  'As a result, there have been some small changes to the staffing structure to meet the new operational requirements.' IMG insiders insist that the PLP headcount across the businesses is growing. However, one member of staff hit out. 'It's not small changes to the staffing structure,' they said.  'This has impacted serious numbers who, in the climate we are in, are now effectively jobless. It stinks.'",
  "94148cced8ebaee53f5321d2c7c945982856085eece10d88824371f9": "The woman responsible for securing Covid vaccines for the UK has been put in charge of solving the HRT crisis.  Madelaine McTernan has been appointed the new HRT tsar and will spearhead efforts to deal with shortages of the medicine.  She helped lead the Vaccine Taskforce, and has been credited with playing a crucial part in Britain's Covid jab success, working to secure vaccine supplies.  Now, she will turn her hand to helping thousands of menopausal women up and down the country who have been struggling to get hold of hormone replacement therapy, mostly due to problems with supplies of a popular oestrogen gel.  Some have resorted to meeting up in car parks to swap medication, or trying to get it from pharmacies abroad.  Other members of the Vaccine Taskforce have also been redeployed to tackle the HRT crisis, as the Government redoubles its efforts to ensure women can get hold of the medication.  Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said: 'I understand how much women rely on HRT which is why we will leave no stone unturned to help make sure women can get the HRT they need. 'Madelaine McTernan will use her excellent skills and expertise to build on the success of the Vaccine Taskforce to bolster supply of vital medicines to women across the country.'  Demand for HRT has risen dramatically, with a 38 per cent increase in the number of prescription items over the past seven years.  The HRT taskforce will be responsible for working with suppliers to find out what can be done to reduce shortages in the short and long term.  Miss McTernan, a Cambridge law graduate who went on to work in investment banking, will remain director general of the Vaccine Taskforce but be primarily focused on HRT supply for the foreseeable future.  'We will apply the key learnings from the successful way the Vaccine Taskforce have procured life-saving vaccines during the pandemic to help ensure women have reliable ongoing access to these critical medicines,' she said",
  "abcee5de40a856c65b708ea3893342dbb1663cbdac5f923098789c21": "A Labour MP launched a 'drunken tirade' against the Conservative MP leading calls for the police to review claims Sir Keir Starmer broke lockdown rules. Three witnesses told the Daily Mail that Mary Foy vented her fury at Richard Holden on the Commons terrace on Tuesday night. She is said to have verbally abused him for asking Durham Police to reopen the investigation into footage of the Labour leader having a beer with officials in her office on April 30, 2021. Witnesses claim the City of Durham MP grabbed Mr Holden by the arm with both hands and tried to drag him across the terrace before staff restrained her. Each witness said the former charity worker, 54, appeared to have been drinking heavily when the incident took place at around 10pm as MPs waited for late-night votes. Mr Holden confirmed he had received a written apology from Mrs Foy the following morning. He said: 'Mary has apologised for her totally unacceptable, drunken behaviour on the terrace and I want to leave it at that.' A Tory source said Mrs Foy's behaviour suggested the 'pressure is showing' on Labour as Durham Police face calls to finally launch a proper investigation into Sir Keir. Mrs Foy declined to comment on the allegations when contacted yesterday and referred all questions to Labour's press office. A party source confirmed she issued a personal apology. The source said the pair had been drinking together in a group where there was 'a bit of back and forth on politics generally'. They added that it was 'incorrect' to say Mrs Foy had grabbed Mr Holden's arm, but did not comment on claims she was drunk. But several witnesses said they were shocked by the ferocity of her tirade. One added: 'She came storming over and just started shouting at him in the most abusive way, swearing at him and accusing him of dragging her into the whole Starmer thing. 'It took place in her office so she's maybe worried that if he gets fined, she'll get fined. He was doing well staying calm and making the point that his target wasn't her, it was Starmer. 'But she was steaming. She grabbed his arm and her staff had to pull her away. One of them came back and was very apologetic. Her behaviour was completely outrageous. If a male MP had behaved to a female MP like that, they'd have been hauled before the Speaker.' A second witness said: 'She was screaming at him, 'How dare you name me and my office in this?' She was finger-jabbing and shouting. 'He was trying to stay calm and be polite but she was very aggressive - she was obviously drunk and feeling the pressure.' A third source said: 'Her staff were trying to restrain her but she just kept going. She was saying some pretty slanderous things and he told her that if he didn't have an apology by the morning, he'd be reporting it to the Speaker.' Last year, Sir Keir and deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner took part in a virtual election event for activists from Durham Miners Hall, where Mrs Foy's constituency office is based. Mrs Foy was later seen chatting to Sir Keir while he enjoyed a beer in her office - at a time when indoor social gatherings were banned. Labour has insisted the footage - filmed by a passer-by - was a brief interlude in a 'work event'. Durham Police dismissed calls to investigate after reviewing the video in February. But Mr Holden asked the force to reopen the inquiry in light of fines issued to Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak over a meeting involving cake in June 2020.",
  "72616c4e1d527c7a4188ed43db3f9ff29950f4135b43e72322b315a6": "Offensive or shocking beliefs can be acceptable in a democratic society, an employment judge said yesterday, as she ruled a pastor was discriminated against for his views about gay Pride events. Keith Waters, 55, a minister at an evangelical church, claimed he was 'forced out' of his caretaker job at a primary school following a single tweet. He wrote: 'A reminder that Christians should not support or attend LGBTQ 'Pride Month' events held in June.  'They promote a culture and encourage activities that are contrary to Christian faith and morals. They are especially harmful to children.' The comments were condemned as homophobic and triggered a vicious backlash, including a campaign of harrassment in which undertakers were sent to Mr Waters' home to 'discuss his funeral'. Isle of Ely Primary School in Ely, Cambridgeshire, began an investigation but the married father-of-one resigned three weeks after the tweet - a day before he was due to face a disciplinary hearing.  Cambridge Employment Tribunal has now ruled he was the victim of indirect discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief. Judge Sarah King said a 'widely shared belief demands particular care before it can be condemned as being not worthy of respect in a democratic society'.  She added: 'Beliefs which are offensive, shocking or even disturbing to others can still be protected.' After the ruling, Mr Waters said it was 'an important win for our freedom to speak the truth of the gospel without fear of losing our jobs'.  He added: 'I took legal action, not because I wanted to sue the school but because what happens to me goes to the heart of what it means to be free to preach the gospel in the UK.' Mr Waters, who founded the New Connexions Free Church in Ely in 2007, made the tweet in June 2019 - the month Cambridge was hosting its first ever Pride event. The school received three formal letters of complaint - one claiming he had called for 'violence against people who support the Pride Festival'. The tribunal did not uphold claims for direct discrimination and unfair dismissal. A spokesman for the Active Learning Trust, which runs the school, said: 'We welcome the decision of the employment tribunal that the claims of direct discrimination and unfair dismissal were not well founded and were dismissed.' Compensation will be determined at a later date.",
  "e66227b33120fc859cc20905bef55ab8d23f9417cd2845ae821c6b99": "Network Rail failed to tell emergency services that power lines were off leaving paramedics waiting for a critical 16 minutes before they could attempt a rescue a visually impaired passenger, inquest hears.  Blind Cleveland Gervais, 53, was struck by a train after he fell onto the tracks shortly after 7pm at Eden Park station in southeast London on 26 February 2020. He was trapped under the third carriage of the stopped train close to two live rails but emergency services only extricated him once it was confirmed that power had been cut off.  Network Rail knew at 7.07pm that someone was trapped under the train and the power was switched off, but it was not until 7.21pm a rail officer confirmed this.  Once it was, a paramedic crawled under the train to reach the fallen victim and pulled him out and over the rail into an awaiting stretcher. By the time he was rescued, Mr Gervais' heart had stopped. Network Rail, who manage stations and tracks, admitted to the coroner's court that 'potentially' the power lines should have been switched off but also said London Ambulance Service should have told them they were on their way.  The 53-year-old regularly used public transport but was blind with light sensitivity only in his right eye and reduced acuity and tunnel vision in his left eye. Daniel Matthews, Control Operations Manager for Network Rail, was not in the control room at the time of the incident but gave evidence as an expert witness. When Coroner Catherine Wood quizzed why Network Rail did not tell all the emergency services that the power was off, Mr Matthews said: 'I can't explain why they didn't or why that wasn't done at the time. He added: 'Potentially the team should have done that. I can't comment on why the team didn't consider calling British Transport Police back to say, 'this is the latest update'.' He also said that, according to protocol, the London Ambulance Service should have notified Network Rail that they were on their way to the incident - but this did not happen. The emergency services waited until Rail Incident Officer (RIO) Scott Debell was on the scene to test the live rail with specialist equipment before going onto the tracks. Asked by Coroner Catherine Wood whether he knew the power was on at the point he arrived, Mr Debell replied: 'When on site we always check with the signal and control if the power is on or off. 'Normally it's switched off. It's no surprise when we arrive on-site and it's an emergency and it's switched off.' The coroner asked: 'Why do you always check?' 'It's normal procedure for a RIO to check the rail for an extra safety measure,' Mr Debell replied. 'A lot of emergency services asked us about the power and it's peace of mind for them to prove that the power is actually isolated when we can show it with our device.' 'Were they waiting for you to check before they did anything further?' said Coroner Wood. Mr Debell replied: 'Yes, they were waiting.' Jude Bunting, QC, representing Mr Gervais' family, said: 'It was clear to you that power had already been turned off.' 'That's correct,' said Mr Debell.  'And therefore, it wasn't necessary for the emergency services to wait for you,' Mr Bunting continued. 'No,' said Mr Debell. He said that the lawyer representing the British Transport Police, asked each witness from the emergency services if it was necessary to wait for the ROI because no one else could confirm the power was off. 'It wasn't necessary to,' the witness said. 'If the power lines had been turned off is there any risk in going down to track?' asked Mr Bunting. 'Only tripping hazards,' replied Mr Debell. But he told the inquest that he has never been in a situation before when the emergency services have to directly touch the third rail to get to a casualty and they have started before the ROI arrived. When responding to jury questions, Mr Debell was able to recall an instance when the third rail tested live after the Network Rail electrical control room confirmed it was switched off. Dr Simi George, who confirmed the post-mortem examination, told the inquest that the cause of Mr Gervais' death was 'multiple traumatic injuries'. She said the major findings were the amputation to the leg and a pelvic fracture which was found upon internal examination, but there was 'no major trauma to the main organs'. Dr George said: 'My conclusion was, given the extent of the damage with fractures to the limbs and pelvis and with exposure of muscle, bone and soft tissue, the cause of death would have been major haemorrhage leading to death. 'It was most likely to be some form of haemorrhage or hypovolemic shock due to multiple traumatic injuries.' She added: 'There was presence of alcohol but not in fatal range and cannabis metabolites, but I don't believe they were in any significant amount to associate with death.' His blood alcohol level was just 20 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood - far below the legal drink-drive limit of 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. Mr Bunting asked: 'Is it correct that you considered that the real cause of death was blood loss?' 'Yes, I believe it was blood loss,' responded Dr George. But she was unable to tell how rapid blood loss would have been from the post-mortem examination. The inquest continues.",
  "68b4aede57cf4d6a004fd398b90321a11435f0bc7b7d9e58512fa670": "A paedophile nurse who downloaded baby rape images was struck off but the married father-of-four has avoided jail.   Christopher Ewan, 45, who used to work in A&E, downloaded more than 100 child rape files, plus extreme porn images showing bestiality.    His innocent wife and children were forced to flee the family home in Netherton, Merseyside after it was targeted by vigilantes who vandalised it.   Ewan's wife has since left him and he has 'lost' his children, a court heard. His defence lawyer told the court Ewan's interest in adult porn was in the 45-year-old's words 'thrill seeking' and progressed to viewing child sex abuse images.  Ewan's computer had 137 Category A images, including 10 videos which are seen as the most extreme forms of abuse and involve children being raped.  Along with the suspended sentence he was also ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register and comply with a Sexual Harm Prevention Order for 10 years.  The former Aintree Hospital nurse has also now been officially prohibited from practising nursing in the UK.  The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC), which regulates the register of nurses able to practise in the UK, published a judgment from a disciplinary hearing which concluded Ewan would remain a potential risk to patients if he was not struck off. An independent panel concluded: 'Children suffer harm as a result of indecent images being made, possessed and distributed. Offences involving indecent images of children exploit children and amount to an abuse of children. 'It is therefore not guaranteed that a member of the public in Mr Ewan's care would be safe, or indeed, feel safe, in his care. 'The panel therefore determined that Mr Ewan is liable to place patients at a risk of harm in the future, that his conviction, for such serious and morally culpable offences, has brought the nursing profession into disrepute and breached fundamental tenets of the profession.' The panel heard that Ewan, who had worked at Aintree since 2013, was referred to the NMC by both Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Merseyside Police. Back in September, the court heard Merseyside Police officers knocked on the door of Ewan's home on June 22, 2020, after receiving a tip-off about 'suspicious activity' relating to a Sky broadband account and messaging app Kik Messenger.  Officers seized various devices, which were later found to contain 137 Category A images, including 10 videos. Category A images are classed as depicting the most extreme forms of abuse under sentencing law and involve children being raped.  The police also found 219 Category B images, including two videos, 130 Category C images, one pseudo (cartoon) image of abuse and 21 extreme pornographic images. Christopher Hopkins, prosecuting in court, said during the sentencing hearing that one Category A image showed a female baby aged six to 12 months and one Category A video, around 24 minutes long, featured children aged eight, seven and four. Mr Hopkins said: 'So of their type, they are particularly serious images in the Crown's submission.'  In a pre-sentence report Ewan claimed he did not intentionally download the images or do it for sexual gratification but later admitted that was not true.  Desmond Lennon, defending, said: 'He unreservedly accepts deliberately downloading this material.  'He also accepts at the time there was a sexual interest in children and the notes indicate, being pressed, accepts it remains.' Mr Lennon said Ewan was married for 19 years with four children, but developed an interest in adult porn, which the dad described as 'thrill seeking'. He said at the time of the offending his client had been off work due to 'stress' and his interest in adult porn progressed to viewing child sex abuse images. Mr Lennon said if Ewan was spared jail, he could receive 'the assistance he perhaps now belatedly recognises that he needs'.  The lawyer said: 'He understands how it's not only affected him, but people who are very important to him, his wife and children. His wife has left him, the marriage is over and his four children have been taken away from him.' Mr Lennon said when Ewan's crimes first became public knowledge, it had a 'catastrophic effect' on the family, who then lived in Netherton.  He said: 'The home was vandalised, bricks were thrown through the window, paint was thrown at the front door and people congregated outside, behaving in an intimidating way. The effect on his children in particular has been devastating.' Judge Anil Murray told Ewan: 'You were of previous good character. More than that, more than just having no previous convictions, you were of positive good character and worked as a professional person. By this offending you have thrown all that away.' Judge Murray said by law he had to consider guidelines on whether this sentence should be served immediately, and because Ewan had no history of poor compliance with court orders, was thought to have a realistic prospect of rehabilitation, and jailing him would have 'some significant impact' on his family, he was 'able, but only just, to suspend the sentence in this case'. He was handed a suspended prison sentence at Liverpool Crown Court in September, having admitted three counts of downloading and one count of possessing indecent images of children, plus possessing a prohibited image of a child and extreme porn.  He handed Ewan 10 months in prison, suspended for two years, with a 40-day Rehabilitation Activity Requirement. ",
  "821a006efea1bcc51708fe9d02b62482f370cc9400373c4102554527": "Vladimir Putin will launch an all-out nuclear war on the West rather than accept defeat in Ukraine, Russia's chief propagandists have declared, in just the latest chilling threat coming from Moscow. Margarita Simonyan, editor of state broadcaster RT and one of the Kremlin's highest-profile mouthpieces, declared on TV last night that the idea of Putin pressing the red button is 'more probable' than the idea that he will allow Russia to lose the war. 'Either we lose in Ukraine,' she said, 'or the Third World War starts. I think World War Three is more realistic, knowing us, knowing our leader.  'The most incredible outcome, that all this will end with a nuclear strike, seems more probable to me than the other course of events. 'This is to my horror on one hand,' she told a panel of experts shifting nervously in their seats, 'but on the other hand, it is what it is. We will go to heaven, while they will simply croak... We're all going to die someday.' Simonyan's calm imagining of nuclear holocaust is just the latest threat issued from the top levels of the Russian state, after fellow propagandist Vladimir Solovyov, foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, and Putin himself issued threats in the last 48 hours. The US and UK have dismissed such rhetoric as bluster but the increasing frequency of the threats coupled with the failures of Russia's military will raise fears that a Cold War-style standoff is now a realistic possibility before the war in Ukraine ends. It comes after Russia successfully test-launched its latest nuclear missile - Sarmat 2 - last week, with Putin boasting it can strike targets anywhere on earth and cannot be stopped by any current missile defences.  Lavrov was the first to raise the nuclear threat in an interview on Russian state TV late Tuesday, when he was asked whether the current standoff between east and west could be compared to the Cuban missile crisis at the height of the Cold War. The foreign minister responded that the current situation is more dangerous, because the weapons involved are more powerful, the controls on them more lax, and communication between the two sides is non-existent. 'During the Cuban Missile Crisis there were not many 'written' rules. But the rules of conduct were clear enough.  'Moscow understood how Washington was behaving. Washington understood how Moscow was behaving. Now there are few rules left,' he said. Asked directly about the threat of nuclear war, he added: 'The risks are very significant. I do not want the danger to be artificially inflated [but] it is serious, real. It cannot be underestimated.' That was followed by off-the-cuff remarks from Solovyev while discussing the deployment of Sarmat 2 with the head of the Roscosmos space agency, who said the missile will go into service later this year.  'As it turned out, one Sarmat means minus one Great Britain,' Solovyov boasted, suggesting the UK deserves to wiped off the map because it has become 'totally boorish' - in what appeared to be a reference for this country's support for Ukraine. Dmitry Rogozin, head of the Roscosmos space agency, told Solovyov that 46 of the missiles will be constructed with the first deployed to units in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, later this year. 'Everything is according to plan with us,' he said. 'It is all according to plan.' That was then followed by a threat from Putin himself, who vowed a 'lightning-fast' response to any country who directly intervenes in the Ukraine conflict. 'If someone intends to interfere in what is going on from the outside they must know that constitutes an unacceptable strategic threat to Russia,' he said during a meeting with lawmakers in St Petersburg. 'They must know that our response to counter strikes will be lightning fast. Fast. 'We have all the weapons we need for this. No one else can brag about these weapons, and we won't brag about them. But we will use them.' Putin did not directly mention nukes, but his phrasing appears to be a clear reference to the new Sarmat missile which he boasted is unlike any other weapon in the world as it was tested last week. It also echoes a threat that Putin made as he declared the start of his 'special military operation' back in February, which was that any country seeking to interfere would face consequences 'never seen before in their history'. The nuclear threats from state media also echo a wider narrative emerging from the Kremlin's propaganda machine which is that Russia is now engaged in a full-scale conflict with NATO that pre-sages a Third World War. Olga Skabeeva, another state TV host and Kremlin mouthpiece, declared on Tuesday that a summit of 40 defence ministers in Germany held to coordinate arms deliveries to Ukraine was effectively a declaration of war. 'They declared a war,' she told viewers. 'World War III, no longer just a special operation, with forty countries against us.' Political scientist Mikhail Markelov agreed with her, declaring that those 40 countries are 'today's collective Hitler'. Dmitry Kulikov, another state media personality, also repeated the line. 'This is a big war,' he said. 'The West declared it against us.  'Let's be worthy of our predecessors, everyone who lived through that. What made us think that our lives should be better than those of our grandparents?  'Why should we be free of our historical mission?' Russia is now more than two months into what was supposed to be a days-long 'special military operation' to topple the Ukrainian government and install a puppet regime loyal to Moscow. Ahead of the war, most experts and observers predicted Ukraine's military would survive only a few days or weeks against the onslaught, but troops have defied the doubters and remain in control of most of the country 62 days later. Having failed in its aim of taking Kyiv, Russia is now concentrating its forces in the east in the hopes of seizing control of the Donbas region and encircling a large part of Ukraine's ground forces. Moscow's generals have also said their aim is to push out from Kherson - on the Black Sea coast and the only major city to fall to Putin's forces so far - and capture Mykolaiv and Odesa, cutting Ukraine off from the ocean. But Western nations have rallied to support Kyiv, with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin declaring earlier this week that Ukraine will be given all the weapons it needs to 'win' the war and 'weaken' Russia to the point where it cannot attack again. Liz Truss, British defence secretary, explicitly spelled out the victory condition in a speech last night - saying arms deliveries will 'keep going further and faster to push Russia out of the whole of Ukraine'. That would mean not just re-taking the parts of Ukraine Russia has occupied since Putin ordered the invasion in February this year, but re-taking the parts attacked and annexed since 2014 - namely Crimea and rebel-held areas of Donetsk and Luhansk. Ms Truss argued that the war could last for ten years, but that the West must be prepared 'for the long haul.' If Putin succeeds in his war aims, she warned, then there will be 'untold further misery across Europe and terrible consequences across the globe'. Some of those consequences took shape this week as Russia began cutting off gas supplies to Europe - something it has long-threatened to do but which was considered a remote possibility because of the damage it would do to the economy. Poland and Bulgaria both had their gas supplies cut on Wednesday, sending the wholesale price soaring and threatening to inflict further financial pain on Europe as it recovers from Covid and deals with inflation. Germany - which is highly dependent on Russian gas after years of foreign policy moves designed to forge ties with the Kremlin - now fears it will be next. Experts have predicted that such a move is likely to plunge Germany's economy, the world's fourth-largest, into a recession. Italy an Austria could also be targeted. Moscow is demanding that all countries must now buy its gas in rubles in an attempt to shore up its currency after it was hammered by Western sanctions over Ukraine. One expert told the Times that most European Union importers were 'extraordinarily' likely to give way to Russia. Hungary, whose president Viktor Orban has warm ties with Putin, is already thought to have found a work-around to the demand.  The Russian move is forcing governments across Europe to speed up a switch to alternative supplies. Western officials say that this represents a major strategic failure for Moscow. One UK official said: 'This will be one of the major strategic developments from this campaign and it will be a failure for Russia because it will reduce its income and also compromise its offensive capability. 'This is one of the costs we are inflicting on Russia. Long-term sanctions will have the same effect. The Prime Minister has said Russia must be seen to have failed.' Britain's Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab slammed Russia's decision, saying it will add to its status as an 'economic and political pariah'. President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said Russia's attempts at 'blackmail' were doomed to fail. She called it 'unjustified and unacceptable' and said it pointed to Russia being an unreliable gas supplier. The EU was prepared for this scenario and contingency plans are in place to get gas from alternative sources and maintain maximum gas storage levels. Poland and Bulgaria are already receiving gas via their EU neighbours, including Greece. Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki was applauded by MPs in parliament when he said the 'blackmail' would have no effect. Bulgarian prime minister Kiril Petkov said that it was a 'gross violation'. And despite Bulgaria taking nearly 80 per cent of its gas from Russia, he added: 'We won't give in to such racketeering.' While there was a 20 per cent price hike in European wholesale gas prices in early trading, much of this fell away later in the day. But despite many countries in Europe rallying together, four major gas trading companies have bowed to pressure to pay for Russian supplies in roubles through back channels, a report by Bloomberg claimed yesterday. The names of the buyers and countries have not been revealed. However Slovakia, which is heavily reliant on Russian gas, previously suggested it may be forced to comply with demands.",
  "40cb83928e04d6fcaf12b02882df5ded263223259b82d400b2cc375d": "While most people in cities will be unsurprised to learn they live in an area with high air pollution, the full extent of the problem in the UK has been revealed. An analysis by the Central Office of Public Interest (COPI) has revealed how 97 per cent of UK addresses now breach at least one of the World Health Organisation's limits for toxic pollutants. Meanwhile, nearly 75 per cent of us live in areas that breach limits of all three toxic pollutants - nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) and particulate matter 10 (PM10). COPI has created an interactive tool that lets you check what the air pollution levels are at your address, as well as its ranking relative to other addresses in the country. Humphrey Milles, founder of COPI, said: 'Air pollution affects all of us. It's a group one cause of cancer, just like asbestos. 'With this new accurate data now publicly available, it would be shameful for the property industry to not start acting transparently. Lives depend on it. Everyone has a right to know what they're breathing before they buy or rent.'  PM is a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air. They are created from a variety of sources, including traffic, construction sites, unpaved roads, fields, smokestacks or fires. Most particles form in the atmosphere as a result of reactions of chemicals such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.  Some PM, such as dust, dirt, soot, or smoke, is large or dark enough to be seen with the naked eye.  Other PM is so small it can only be detected using an electron microscope.  PM2.5 - of diameters that are generally 2.5 micrometers and smaller - differ from PM10 - 10 micrometers and smaller. Source: US EPA  COPI sourced and mapped the air pollution levels recorded at 20,000 sites in over 320 UK council areas. Using this data and DEFRA-approved council monitor data, experts at Imperial College London generated a national model with an incredible 20m/sq resolution. The interactive tool, which can be accessed at addresspollution.org, reveals how air quality varies across the UK. For example, Buckingham Palace, which is in the heart of London, falls into the 98th percentile, with some of the highest air pollution levels in the UK. In contrast, Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire has some of the cleanest air in the UK, and falls into the lowest percentile. Unsurprisingly, major cities across the UK have some of the highest levels of air pollution. However, some addresses in Kent, Bath and East Anglia were also found to fall into the top percentile for dirty air. 'We all have our own part to play in this. Air pollution isn't insurmountable and we can all do something about it,' Mr Milles said. Last year, a Southwark coroner ruled that air pollution contributed to the 2013 death of Ella Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, nine, who lived 80ft from the South Circular road in Lewisham, south-east London. As part of the ruling, he asked the Government to explain how it would prevent future deaths - leading to the pledge from ministers to set aside an extra PS6million for local authorities to improve air quality and raise public awareness. The coroner's report, following a second inquest which ruled that air pollution contributed to Ella's death, called for legally binding goals for dangerous pollutant particulate matter (PM2.5) that are in line with WHO guidelines.  These suggest keeping an average concentration of PM2.5 under 10 micrograms per cubic metre of air (ug/m3), to prevent increased deaths.  Rosamund Kissi-Debrah, Ella's mother, said: 'This data shows yet again that the government is failing the British public. 'Now people can really see the filthy air they're breathing at their home, school or work address, and it is no wonder that the NHS waiting lists are ever growing. 'Everyone needs to know what they're breathing, and now with this new public service they can.' Professor Sir Stephen Holgate, special advisor on air quality to the Royal College of Physicians, added: 'Air pollution is an invisible killer, and because you can't see it it's easy for people to forget and ignore. 'It's essential that the public are given air pollution data for where they are thinking of buying or renting. In many cases like that of little Ella, it can be a matter of life or death.' In June it was revealed that tougher air pollution laws would be brought in following the death of a girl from an asthma attack caused by traffic fumes. A Southwark coroner ruled in December 2020 that air pollution - including illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide - contributed to the 2013 death of Ella Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, who lived 80ft from the South Circular road in Lewisham, south-east London.   The nine-year-old died after suffering three years of seizures and nearly 30 visits to hospital for treatment to breathing problems. The council admitted pollution levels were a 'public health emergency' at the time of the schoolgirl's death but it failed to act on it.  Coroner Philip Barlow said Ella's mother, Rosamund, had not been given information which could have led to her take steps which might have prevented her daughter's death.   On April 21, Mr Barlow said legally binding targets for particulate matter in line with World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines would reduce the number of deaths from air pollution in the UK and urged the Government to take action. The WHO guidelines suggest keeping an average concentration of PM2.5 under 10 micrograms per cubic metre of air (ug/m3), to prevent increased deaths. The UK limit, based on European Union (EU) recommendations, is a yearly average of 25 ug/m3. Ella's bereft mother, who spent more than five years campaigning for justice, said she would have moved home if she had known polluted air was killing her daughter.  She said: 'Because of a lack of information I did not take the steps to reduce Ella's exposure to air pollution that might have saved her life.  'I will always live with this regret.  'People are dying from air pollution each year. Action needs to be taken now or more people will simply continue to die.'",
  "2ce2080f467639dfe6a9af19326cb9576c9fa8f009bbf5e0c3a5b079": "Nicky Clarke has said the pandemic changed the 'attitudes of workers' because they wanted 'to do less days but be paid the same'. The celebrity hair stylist, 63, whose clients have included Princess Diana, the Duchess of York (who performed the opening ceremony), Margaret Thatcher, Elizabeth Taylor and David Bowie, is shutting his Mayfair salon after 30 years. Speaking to Eamonn Holmes and Isabel Webster on GB News today, Nicky explained: 'The thing that the pandemic has changed, not just in terms of the clients coming in and not wanting to be in Mayfair, also I think, attitudes of the workers. 'You've got so many people really, that are wanting to do less days and, being paid the same amount of money, but I think mostly it was the fact that we set a standard that was at a very high level. 'We did something very, very new... and we weren't really able to continue at that level.' His chat with the television presenters comes after the Daily Mail yesterday revealed that he had told his devastated staff on Monday that the salon would be closing.  Nicky, who has cut and styled the hair of thousands of high profile clients over the years including Princess Diana, the Duchess of York and David Bowie, has also seen higher costs have a huge impact on his business. Speaking on Tuesday, Nicky announced the closure of the salon, explaining: 'This prestigious salon has been in Mayfair for over 30 years and has been a huge part of our lives, both personally and professionally. 'However, the last two years have been the toughest we have experienced, with Covid-enforced, long-term closures, rising rates and overheads making the salon no longer economically sustainable.' He added: 'This was not an easy decision to make, we have spent months exploring alternative solutions to keep the salon in business but unfortunately these have not come to fruition. 'All staff impacted will be paid fully and all our obligations to them fulfilled. We're incredibly grateful to the dedication and hard work of every single member of staff.' Nicky added in today's discussion on GB News: 'I've got hundreds and hundreds of wonderful messages from clients, but also from members of staff that just said that was just the best time of their lives.' The stylist, 63, who was raised in a London council flat, founded the business with long-term girlfriend, Lesley Clarke, 68, thanks to a PS20,000 loan, and the pair turned it into an empire which was said to be worth PS60 million. He later split from Lesley after confessing to having an affair with a Vivien Westwood model, but the pair remained close, with Lesley even accompanying Nicky when he received an OBE in 2008. Presenter Isabel quipped on today's GB News interview that Nicky must have heard hundreds of secrets from high profile clients over the years.  He replied: 'I used to say that I could write tomorrow's front page. Nicky continued: 'The reason I could say that was because I was entrusted with an awful lot of information.' And he revealed that the salon near the Connaught Hotel had a secret entrance so that clients could come to the salon without being seen by press photographers.  He said that while many of his clients have reputations for being divas, he never saw that side of them. Nicky added that he was starstruck by boyhood heroes including David Bowie and Bryan Ferry. The 63-year-old said: 'I could probably say that I probably did most of the older divas - Margaret Thatcher, Diana Ross's, Naomi Campbell, they were fabulous with me, they were just lovely. 'It's really when you're doing your boyhood heroes, you know - David Bowie and Bryan Ferry and all, and actually, it's just I'm a huge Bowie fan. I used to camp outside his house when I was 13.'",
  "37c089bc0e312aa3072413b89e9a52a1672c329f79a9dc95931b65ec": "Ted Lasso star Jason Sudeikis has sparked furious debate online after his ex-fiencee Olivia Wilde was served with custody papers while she was on-stage in front of 4,000 people giving a presentation about the movie that sparked her romance with current boyfriend Harry Styles.  The extraordinary incident sent shockwaves through Hollywood on Tuesday night, when images emerged of a flustered Wilde, 38, being presented with a 'personal and confidential' manila envelope while she was in the middle of a speech about her upcoming thriller Don't Worry Darling at this year's CinemaCon in Las Vegas.  Now, some social media users are railing against Ted Lasso star Sudeikis, 46, accusing the comedic actor of purposefully trying to embarrass his ex-fiancee, with whom he shares two children - eight-year-old son Otis and five-year-old daughter Daisy.  However, sources close to the actor have insisted that he was unaware Wilde would be served the papers in such a public and humiliating manner, with one insider telling DailyMail.com that Sudeikis had 'no prior knowledge' of when the documents would be handed to her - and insisting that the actor has been left appalled and upset over the incident.  The source added that the papers in question were not actually 'custody' documents but rather jurisdiction papers, which typically determine which court will hear and decide a child custody case.  Still, Twitter has erupted with speculation about the sensational moment, with some seizing the opportunity to compare Sudeikis with his beloved Apple TV+ character Ted Lasso, whom many noted would never have condoned such 'savage' behavior. 'So Ted Lasso is an A**Ho?' one person wrote on Twitter, while another chimed in: 'D**k move Ted Lasso.' 'There's no way Ted Lasso did that,' a third person added, as another insisted: 'Ted Lasso would never.' Some social media users accused the actor of wanting to ensure that his ex was served with the papers in as public a forum as possible, suggesting that it was his way of seeking revenge after she went public with her romance with Styles, 28, just a few months after her split from Sudeikis was made public.  'I had an ex served with papers before and there is absolutely NO WAY Jason Sudeikis didn't know where and when Olivia Wilde would be served... NO WAY! The when and where is something that is discussed before the papers are delivered,' one Twitter user wrote.  Speaking to DailyMail.com, one source close to Sudeikis insisted that the actor had no idea when or where the papers were going to be served to Wilde by the Los Angeles-based process server, who was hired by his Brooklyn-based law firm. The insider added that Sudeikis had no contact with the process server, whose employment was handled entirely by his attorneys.  'Papers were drawn up to establish jurisdiction relating to the children of Ms. Wilde and Mr. Sudeikis,' the source said. 'Mr. Sudeikis had no prior knowledge of the time or place that the envelope would have been delivered as this would solely be up to the process service company involved and he would never condone her being served in such an inappropriate manner.'  It had initially been reported that the documents were an unsolicited script sent by a fan in the hopes of receiving Wilde's attention - however that didn't stop furious speculation among attendees at the annual event about whether or not the envelope actually contained legal documentation, rumors that were eventually confirmed by Deadline. Wilde was mid-way through a presentation about her new movie - which she directed and in which her beau Styles, 28, stars - when she was briefly interrupted by an unidentified person who approached the stage from the front rows of the audience at the Vegas event and slid the manila envelope across the front of the stage toward her. 'This is for me?' Wilde asked, before opening the envelope and briefly reading the documents. She then continued with her presentation.  Wilde and Sudeikis began dating in November 2011 and got engaged in December 2012, before eventually splitting in November 2020. They share two children together - eight-year-old son Otis and five-year-old daughter Daisy. Details of their current custody arrangement remain private, and neither Olivia nor Jason have commented on the contents of the envelope.  However their silence has not stopped social media users from engaging in a bitter debate over who was in the right - with some claiming that Sudeikis 'deserved' to get revenge on Wilde after she went public with her romance with Styles, 28, so soon after the former couple split.  'Gotta tip my hat to Jason Sudeikis,' one person wrote. 'I would have done the same thing... People want only certain things to be public. I think everything should be fair game once you put yourself out there.' Another agreed, tweeting: 'Jason Sudeikis having Olivia Wilde served on stage while giving a presentation in Vegas is wild... honestly, she deserves it.'  CinemaCon said they are now reevaluating their security procedures, in light of the incident: 'We have never in the history of the convention had an incident where a delegate has approached the stage who was not authorized to be there,' Mitch Neuhauser Managing Director of CinemaCon said in a statement to Deadline. 'In light of this incident, we are reevaluating our security procedures to ensure the safety of all our attendees.'  The annual gathering of cinema owners and Hollywood studios at Las Vegas' Colosseum for CinemaCon requires attendees to purchase a badge.  Industry attendees and media must apply for accreditation well in advance of the April convention and upon arrival at the event present 'photo ID matching the name on the required documentation.' Reporter Chris Lee detailed her reaction on stage in a tweet, which read: 'Half way through her schpiel about Don't Worry Darling, Olivia Wilde was handed a manila envelope. Seemed like she got served a lawsuit!'  He said that the Booksmart director said: 'This is for me? Is this a script? Ok got it. Thank you.'  Lee added: 'I thought it was part of the presentation or a joke. But then...that was the end of it.'  Another audience member, Jim Vejvoda, tweeted: 'Was Olivia Wilde served with papers onstage at CinemaCon? 'Some woman walked up to the stage and left an envelope for her. Olivia opened it and then never addressed it and continued on with her presentation.  'We were expecting a bit but she never addressed the papers.'  CinemaCon said they are now reevaluating their security procedures, in light of the incident: 'We have never in the history of the convention had an incident where a delegate has approached the stage who was not authorized to be there,' Mitch Neuhauser Managing Director of CinemaCon said in a statement to Deadline. 'In light of this incident, we are reevaluating our security procedures to ensure the safety of all our attendees.' In order to get into Vegas' Colosseum for CinemaCon, non-industry attendees need to purchase a badge.  Deadline reported that the papers were delivered to Wilde by a process server who was hired by Sudeikis' Brooklyn-based attorneys to issue the legal documents.  The process of serving someone with papers must be conducted by a third party who is over the age of 18. This person can be a law officer, a friend or family member, or - as was the case with Wilde - a hired process server who is paid to deliver the legal documents in-person.  Rules for serving papers vary from state to state, however typically the law dictates that papers must be handed to a defendant directly.  Wilde's latest film Don't Worry Darling is being released by Warner Brothers this coming September and stars her much younger boyfriend Styles.  The duo formed a close bond while shooting the psychological thriller, which also features the likes of Florence Pugh and Gemma Chan, in 2020.  News of Wilde and Sudeikis's split came on November 13, 2020 with sources claiming at the time that it was 'amicable' and that their two children son Otis and daughter Daisy Josephine would remain a 'priority.'  An insider also said that the pair had actually separated at the start of the year, months before their split was made public.   A source close to the couple told PEOPLE: 'The split happened at the beginning of the year [2020]. It's been amicable and they've transitioned into a great co-parenting routine. The children are the priority and the heart of the family's relationship.'  Despite the initial reports of an amicable split, a source claimed to Entertainment Tonight in January 2021, that Jason had been 'really hurt' by her moving on with Harry.  A source said: '[Jason] has been really hurt and somewhat jealous that Olivia has moved on with Harry.' There have also been conflicting reports as to the timeline of Olivia's split from Jason and when she started her new relationship with Harry. The original PEOPLE report on their split claimed that Olivia and Jason broke up 'at the beginning' of 2020, but further sources claimed 'she and Jason were very much together as recently as this fall [2020].' A report from UsWeekly claimed: 'Olivia called off the engagement in early November [2020] but only after she already had gotten close to Harry.' Olivia cast Harry in her film in September 2020 after Shia LaBeouf was fired from the role. Rumours of Harry and Olivia's romance were confirmed when they were seen holding hands at his agent's wedding in Montecito, California, on January 3 2021, raising eyebrows over just how quickly she had moved on. May, 2011 -  Jason and Olivia meet at a Saturday Night Live wrap party in 2011, when both were recently single after ending their marriages Jason later recalled he didn't make 'any sort of moves' at the time  November, 2011 -  The pair start dating after months of friendship December 2012 - Jason proposes over the holidays 2014 - The couple welcome their first child, a son Otis 2016 - Their daughter Daisy is born with Wilde explaining how she believes becoming a parent with Jason is a stronger commitment for the couple than tying the knot October 2020 - Olivia starts shooting her second directional effort Don't Worry Darling, starring new cast member Harry Styles November 2020 - Jason and Olivia split  January 2021 -  Harry and Olivia's romance is confirmed when they are seen holding hands at his agent's wedding in Montecito, California, on January 3   There were conflicting reports on the exact timing of their split, with a source claiming to PEOPLE in a January 2021 report: 'Jason feels that the timeline that Olivia and Harry would like people to believe - that she and Jason split ages ago, long before she became involved with Harry - is simply not accurate.' The source added that the trouble began around the start of production on Wilde's sophomore directorial effort in the fall of 2020. 'She began filming [Don't Worry Darling] in September, and by October, he began to get the impression that she wanted out. By November, they'd announced their split.' The source emphasized 'that's how quickly it happened,' adding that 'none of it happened until she began filming with Harry.' In a December 2021 interview with American Vogue the actress referred to the timeline dispute, telling the magazine: 'It's obviously tempting to correct a false narrative. 'But I think what you realize is that when you're really happy, it doesn't matter what strangers think about you.' She added: 'All that matters to you is what's real, and what you love, and who you love.' Jason meanwhile confirmed in a 2021 interview with GQ that the couple split in November 2020, admitting that 'I'll have a better understanding of why in a year.' 'And an even better one in two, and an even greater one in five, and it'll go from being, you know, a book of my life to becoming a chapter to a paragraph to a line to a word to a doodle,' he continued. 'That's an experience that you either learn from or make excuses about. You take some responsibility for it, hold yourself accountable for what you do, but then also endeavor to learn something beyond the obvious from it.' Olivia scrambled to cast Harry to star in her second film after initially casting Shia LaBeouf in the lead role.  LaBeouf was fired from the project in September 2020 because she has a 'zero a**hole policy' and his behavior was 'off-putting,' according to Variety, with a source saying: 'He is not an easy guy to work with.' Shortly after he was replaced, Shia entered a rehab facility after his ex-girlfriend, musician FKA twigs, claimed he knowingly infected her with an STD and relentlessly abused her. Jason also moved on, embarking on a relationship with his Ted Lasso co-star, British glamour model Keeley Hazell, 35, last year.  Jason and Olivia met at a Saturday Night Live wrap party in May 2011, when both were recently single.  Nine months prior, Olivia ended her eight-year marriage to Italian-American filmmaker Tao Ruspoli and Jason had just divorced screenwriter Kay Cannon, whom he was married to from 2004 to 2010.  During a 2017 appearance on The Late Late Show With Stephen Colbert, the Horrible Bosses star spilled on his first interaction with Wilde. 'I actually came off looking a lot cooler than I really am because I had heard through the grapevine, through mutual friends that weren't exactly her best girlfriends, that would report back, 'Oh, you know, I think she's dating someone,' so I didn't make any sort of moves,' he recalled at the time.  'I was just very, very busy with other things.' The actress echoed the thoughts, explaining:  'I was just learning to be by myself; I'd been divorced nine months.  'We were both seeing people but were single. He seemed to really see me, see through the bull***t.' Wilde and Sudeikis announced their engagement in 2013 before the births of their two children. Speaking to Net-a-Porter's Porter Edit in February 2016, Wilde explained how she believed becoming a parent with her ex was a stronger commitment for the couple than tying the knot. 'We are seriously connected,' she said. 'Before you have a child, marriage is the ultimate commitment and promise to one another, and then once you have a child, it's like, 'Oh, we're committed and promised already.' Nearly a year and a half after they first met, Wilde and Styles are still going strong. The actress recently supported the popstar as he headlined the Coachella Valley Music Festival the past two weekends.  She was captured cheering him on in the crowd as he dominated the stage with a guitar in hand. Recent reports have suggested that Olivia and Harry are getting very serious after she introduced the pop star to her two children.  Insiders have claimed that despite it looking like a 'showbiz hook up' at first, it has become clear that the loved-up couple are much more than that. Harry, who has previously dated a slew of celebrity girlfriends, has allegedly never been so serious about anyone before, reports The Sun. A source said: 'This looked like quite a showbizzy thing at first, two glamorous people hooking up but now it's obviously a lot more than that. 'They held back a bit at first but now that things are more settled the time was right to do the next thing. 'It's really exciting for them - and for Harry it's the most serious he has ever really been about somebody.' It was reported that Harry is 'slowly' getting to know the children of his girlfriend Olivia almost a year into their relationship.  Olivia is currently living in the UK with the singer while estranged husband Jason films the third series of the comedy drama Ted Lasso. She has her two children in London while he is working on the Apple TV programme, set in the UK. 'Ironically, it is Jason's work that means they can be together,' said a source, adding that friends are expecting Harry and Olivia to marry.",
  "49738d74f93ac1f6b3aa2186ecacaf1840ec8cc92f9964859d6cf5c3": "A heroin addict and 'abject failure' of a mother has been jailed for 20 years after she put her drug habit before her little boy, using the severely asthmatic seven-year-old's inhaler to smoke crack and his bed to entertain her sex worker clients - before he died alone 'gasping for air' in the garden.  Laura Heath, 40, was jailed for 20 years today because of her 'catastrophic and deplorable' parenting that led to the death of neglected and abused Birmingham schoolboy Hakeem Hussain in November 2017 in yet another child cruelty scandal that shames British social services.  Tragic Hakeem begged his mother to stop doing drugs but she ignored him. His fragile and 'freezing' body was eventually discovered clutching a leaf outside a decrepit flat where he was staying with her and other addicts because the power and heating had been cut off in their own home. She also refused him a bed so she could use it for sex work, so he slept on the sofa. Heath had even used foil and an elastic band to rig one of her son's blue inhalers to smoke crack. The addict had a PS55-a-day habit and her son was found to have inhaled tobacco smoke in the hours before his death, having also been exposed to heroin, crack cocaine and cannabis through second-hand smoke. She was found guilty of the gross negligence manslaughter of her seven-year-old son at Coventry Crown Court a week ago and was sentenced to 20 years in prison today, although must only serve a minimum of 13 years and two months. Mr Justice Dove told Heath as she stood impassively in the dock today: 'You should have followed Hakeem's advice and stopped taking drugs. You didn't.'  He went on: 'You betrayed the trust of all children who have to place their trust in their parents to do the best for them and you catastrophically failed to act as a responsible mother. 'All of these offences were committed while you were under the influence or indeed in the thrall of drugs, in particular heroin and crack cocaine. Your addiction no doubt led to you prioritising your drug use over almost everything else in your life'.  Hakeem had died less than 48 hours after social workers failed to act on a school nurse's plea to immediately remove the boy from his mother's care before the weekend he died because his life was in danger. The council workers refused, saying they wanted to wait until Monday instead, by which time he was dead. Following the social services meeting his mother messaged a friend saying: 'Hakeem is on child protection... neglect... hey ho... gonna do what I gotta do.'  Hakeem, described as 'bubbly and full of life with brilliant communication skills' by his school where he had 'stolen the show' at the last nativity play before he died, had even begged his mother to give up drugs - but she put her addiction over her son's safety and wellbeing at every turn until it cost him his life.   On the night he died, police believe the seven-year-old had let himself out of the flat some time after 10.30pm because it had been dense with drugs smoke - but he then died gasping for air in the garden and his body, already stiff from rigor mortis, was found at 7.30am the following morning. His mother from hell was out cold inside because she had gone through three bags of crack.     2013 Hakeem develops asthma symptoms and goes on to be hospitalised three times. He also moves into the Long Acre property, described by one visitor as having 'disgusting' conditions. The witness told how Hakeem said he had no bed, sleeping instead on the sofa, while there was evidence Heath used an upstairs bedroom for sex work to fund her habit with a basket of condoms next to the mattress  2017 On November 24, a school nurse told a child protection conference that Hakeem 'could die at the weekend from asthma'. Nurse Melanie Richards, as well as a family outreach worker at Hakeem's Nechells Primary School who was also in the meeting, scored Hakeem's safety as 'zero' out of 10. The meeting ended with agreement the social worker would speak to Heath on Monday - by which time Hakeem had died. On November 26 Hakeem's freezing body is found outside the Cook Street flat just after 7.30am. On December 11, Dr Roger Malcomson, a consultant paediatric pathologist, conducted an autopsy on at Coventry Mortuary, finding that Hakeem's lungs were 'hyperexpanded.' He told the trial: 'Hakeem's lungs were so hyperexpanded that the lungs overlapped the heart which is not normal. The lungs were in a different position compared to that of a normal person.' 2018 In April, a new organisation, Birmingham Children's Trust, takes over child social services 2022 April 22: Heath is convicted of Hakeem's manslaughter at Coventry Crown Court. Hakeem had no bed, sleeping on the sofa, while there was evidence Heath used an upstairs bedroom for sex work to fund her habit because she kept a basket of condoms next to the mattress. Her son's school clothes were filthy, stank of urine and reeked of cigarettes, but despite the obvious signs of neglect, he wasn't taken into care. Months after his death, Birmingham's failing social services department was taken over poor performance dating back to 2008 when three other children on their radar where either beaten or starved to death by their parents. Today the judge told 40-year-old Heath, who was ordered to serve two-thirds of her 20-year sentence before becoming eligible for parole, that the death had occurred after her life 'entered a drug-fuelled downward spiral into squalor, chaos and tragedy'.  Mr Justice Dove said: 'When Hakeem Hussain died he was only seven-years-old. 'It is clear in his tragically short life Hakeem had been an inspiration of happiness and affection for people who knew him. 'He was described as bubbly and full of life with brilliant communication skills. 'All of that potential for a wonderful and fulfilling life was extinguished as he collapsed on his own clutching a leaf in the garden. 'We can only imagine the pain and fear that must have blighted the end of his young life. For anyone, let alone a child, this was a shockingly terrible way for him to die. 'How could it possibly be that this could happen? The truth is, in short, is that Hakeem died as a result of your deplorable negligence. 'He died as a result of your catastrophic and deplorable parenting. 'From the early spring of 2017 your parenting of Hakeem entered a drug-fuelled downward spiral into squalor, chaos and tragedy. 'It is clear to me from the evidence that this was a truly exceptional and reprehensible breach of duty. 'Your failure to manage Hakeem's asthma was persistent and continuous and caused him obvious distress in the day-by-day deterioration of his condition. 'This offence arises in the context of other serious criminality in the form of your abuse of heroin and cocaine and the charges of child cruelty. 'His medication regime was ignored and neglected and he was exposed at home to triggers in a dirty, smoky and cold environment. 'You fall to be sentenced in the category of very high culpability. There are aggravating features which need to be taken into account. 'The victim was a young child and moreover you were his mother. You were the person who first and foremost had a responsibility for his welfare. 'He was entitled to rely upon you as his adult caregiver, to take care of him and nurture him - especially protecting his health'. Friends also told the court how they witnessed Heath smoking class A drugs while Hakeem was feeling ill in the next room - just 24 hours before he died. The 999 call made by Heath after Hakeem was found was also played to the court during the trial. She said: 'He's dead... my son* he's took himself outside when we're asleep because he's got asthma* and he's fell asleep* he's dead. He's gone... he's blue and he's stiff. There's no saving him. He's gone. He's my baby... he's my baby.' Giving evidence Dr Peter Ehrhardt, a former doctor of safeguarding in East Lancashire, said he was left 'speechless' at the way Hakeem had been treated. The court was told Heath had smoked heroin and crack cocaine in the 48 hours before her son's death and he also had tobacco in his lungs. Dr Ehrhardt said: 'In my opinion she knew the previous night that Hakeem's asthma was not under control. 'Had she acted then in my opinion his deterioration would have been less severe and he would not have died.' Heath had told cops after her arrest that Hakeem would go outside for some fresh air if he was ever struggling with his breathing. She said in her police interview after his death: 'I had a funny feeling he had gone out in the night and fell asleep outside.' After the case Hakeem's head teacher, David Crumps said: 'The news of Hakeem's death shocked our community five years ago - he was a friendly, polite little boy who will forever be remembered for his gentle nature. 'His friends will remember him with love and great fondness and he is greatly missed.' An additional statement on behalf of the children and staff at Nechells E-Act Academy said: 'Hakeem was a most beautiful little boy, a great friend to many staff and children with a wicked sense of humour and an infectious giggle. 'He was a warm and generous-hearted soul who was talented across many areas of the curriculum but especially so in music and the arts. 'He totally stole the show with his performance as the 'Christmas Star' in the year two nativity play with his clear speaking voice and stage presence. 'There wasn't a dry eye in the house as he delivered his lines with poignancy, grace and humour. 'The twinkle in his beautiful eyes was as bright as the stars in the sky, and our love for him will shine out forever, from all of his Nechells family.' Hakeem's death came just months before Birmingham Children's Trust took over child social services in early 2018. Responsibility was transferred from the council's failing child social services department after years of poor performance dating back to 2008.  Those failures were placed in sharp focus by high-profile child deaths, such as those of Khyra Ishaq in 2008, Keanu Williams in 2011, and Keegan Downer in 2015.  2008: Khyra Ishaq Seven-year-old Khyra Ishaq was starved to death by her mother and stepfather after social workers missed opportunities because they were said to be more interested in their careers. Khyra had been monitored and visited by at least nine social workers, education officers, teachers and police, but information was not acted upon and procedures were not followed. She died of an infection in May 2008 following a 'chilling' punishment regime at her home in Handsworth, Birmingham. Three social workers were disciplined after a report highlighted how some officials were more focused on 'the rights of the adults' and the 'potential impact' on their careers. 2011: Keanu Williams  Two-year-old Keanu Williams had been seen by health workers at least 12 times with signs of abuse such as head injuries and cuts. But children's services believed his mother Rebecca Shuttleworth when she said they were just bumps and bruises. In reality, Shuttleworth, 25, had beaten her son and his body was found in January 2011 with 37 injuries including bite marks, a fractured skull and a tear in his stomach. A report revealed Shuttleworth, jailed in June 2013, had been 'surprised' he wasn't taken away from her at birth. It said 'staff were distracted by his mother's needs rather than the child's'. At least three untrained workers - including a student on a work placement - were also put in charge of vital reviews. 2015: Keegan Downer Kandyce Downer was jailed for life for the murder of 18-month-old Keegan Downer, who died at the family home in Birmingham on 5 September 2015. Keegan had been repeatedly beaten and suffered more than 200 injuries. She had 153 scars on her body, including her face and neck. Downer had been appointed Keegan's guardian with the blessing of social services and six months after Keegan was put in Downer's care, the systematic abuse began. It was claimed Downer only wanted Keegan to rake in PS125-a-week maintenance payments. She also secured a four-figure lump sum towards the cost of a new car for taking on the child, on top of her housing benefit and child support. ... and elsewhere: How social services missed multiple opportunities to save horrifically abused children Logan Mwangi, murdered July 2021  Logan Mwangi never stood a chance as he was kept prisoner and tortured in his home, with social workers missing crucial opportunities to save the little boy before he was murdered by his mother, stepfather and a 14-year-old boy. John Cole, 40, and Angharad Williamson, 31, of Sarn, Bridgend, and a teenage boy, who cannot be named because of his age, were convicted of murdering Logan at Cardiff Crown Court on April 21. On the morning of July 31 2021, the once 'smiling, cheerful little boy', was found by police just 250 metres from his home submerged in the River Ogmore, wearing a pair of dinosaur pyjama bottoms and a Spider-Man top. In the months and weeks leading up to his death, Logan had been 'dehumanised' by his family. His stammer worsened, becoming particularly bad around Cole, and he wet himself more frequently and began self-harming. But in yet another astonishing failing by social services, workers missed at least two opportunities to rescue the schoolboy from the clutches of his parents, who 'kept him prisoner' in his dark bedroom - likened to a 'dungeon' - with a baby gate barring him from leaving after testing positive for coronavirus on July 20.    Star Hobson, murdered September 22, 2020 Star Hobson was only 16 months old when she was killed at her home in Keighley, West Yorkshire.  Star was murdered by her mother Frankie Smith's girlfriend Savannah Brockhill after suffering months of abuse in her home during the Covid lockdown last year. Frankie Smith 20, was handed an eight-year sentence for allowing her daughter's death. This was extended to 12 years in March for being too lenient.  Brockhill, 28, was convicted of murder and jailed for life with a minimum term of 25 years. No appeal was made against her sentence.  It was revealed that social services had missed five opportunities to stop her killers in the months before her death on September 22, 2020.    Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, murdered June 16, 2020  Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, aged six, was murdered by his cruel stepmother Emma Tustin in June. She was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 29 years and the boy's father Thomas Hughes was jailed for 21 years for manslaughter.  The boy had been seen by social workers just two months before his death, but they concluded there were no safeguarding concerns.  In October 2019, Aileen Carabine, a special educational coordinator at Arthur's school, said Arthur 'deteriorated' that month.  Kyrell Matthews, murdered October 20, 2019 Kyrell Matthews, aged two, was left with 41 rib fractures and internal injuries by the time of his death after weeks of cruelty at the hands of his mother Phylesia Shirley and her boyfriend Kemar Brown. Brown was convicted of murder while Shirley was acquitted of murder but found guilty of the alternative charge of manslaughter. They appeared alongside each other in the dock as Brown was sentenced to at least 25 years in prison while Shirley was jailed for 13 years. The toddler, who was non-verbal, could be heard crying and screaming on distressing audio files taken from Shirley's phone and played to jurors during the trial.  Brown and Shirley are understood to have been visited by social services at least once. A jury of 10 women and two men found Heath guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence a day after the mother and stepfather of five-year-old Logan Mwangi were convicted of his murder alongside a 14-year-old youth in South Wales. In that case, jurors were told social services missed at least four chances to intervene, while the teenage defendant's foster carers told how their warnings that the boy had a fascination with killing had fallen on deaf ears. Hakeem was found dead in a garden early on a Sunday morning in November 2017, after seeking fresh air to ease his breathing - and having been unable to wake mother Laura Heath from her drug-induced slumber. In a prophetic intervention, just two days earlier nurse Melanie Richards told a child protection conference arranged to discuss Hakeem's plight that he 'could die at the weekend'. The school's family outreach lead backed the nurse's position but although the serious risk to Hakeem was recognised, he was not removed and instead was made subject to a Child Protection Plan - with social workers planning to step up intervention efforts on the Monday. Jurors in Coventry heard that when Heath was telephoned with the outcome of that child protection meeting, which she declined to attend, she blithely texted a friend: 'Hakeem is on child protection... neglect... hey ho.' Heath's guilty verdict came just four months after the same courtroom heard how the stepmother and father of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes were able to torture and kill the six-year-old after fooling social workers. In the latest case to shame children's services in England:  The three week trial heard how Hakeem had been identified as a child in need six months before his death, in the middle of a three-and-a-half month period where he was recorded absent from school 59 times without authorisation. At one point in the months running up to his death, the helpless child was heard commenting that his jumper 'smells of Charlie' - a street name for cocaine. The court heard Heath had repeatedly ignored medical instruction to help Hakeem manage his asthma, failing to ensure he used his preventative inhaler each day. Expert witness Dr Peter Ehrardt, a retired consultant paediatrician, told the court there was no evidence that Hakeem's asthma was uncontrollable, and said he would not have died if looked after properly. The court heard Hakeem was hospitalised five times - three of those as an emergency patient - as his condition deteriorated. Little more than 24 hours before he died, Heath, invited a friend to the flat they were staying at in Nechells, Birmingham, to 'get smashed'. She had moved out of her own rented flat because the gas had been disconnected due to non-payment. But the friend was so horrified by the condition of the rubbish-filled address she offered to take Hakeem back to her own address. Heath refused. Police photographed drug paraphernalia and an overflowing ashtray amongst rubbish and half-eaten food on the living room table following Hakeem's death early the following morning. When officers went to Heath's own flat, they found rubbish piled up in a bedroom beside a sheetless mattress and a table littered with condoms, where Heath prostituted herself to earn drug cash. Although the court heard Heath had a PS55-a-day habit, the mother of four children by four men had once been earmarked as a university candidate by her form teacher at Byng Kendrick Central secondary school in Tile Cross, Birmingham. A relative said she appeared to fall off the rails after her mother Valerie Drew separated from her alcoholic stepfather, who has since died. Heath got a job at a local taxi office where she 'began to attract the attention of men' and by 15 she was a school truant and pregnant with her first child. The source said the father was a man three decades Heath's senior, but police were never contacted about the relationship. The pregnancy set a marker for a chaotic journey into an adulthood mired in prostitution and addictions to heroin and crack cocaine. By the time her eldest was six, he and his four-year-old sister were taken off Heath to be raised by their grandmother. The source said Heath's own father, a labourer, harboured a drug addiction of his own and had little to do with his daughter after leaving her mother when Heath was small. Heath's third child, a son aged 15, was placed with his Kurdish father after his birth, but Heath was adamant that she would retain custody of Hakeem, who's Muslim father had been jailed for a for a particularly nasty sexual assault by the time she gave birth. Following his release from prison, the couple were placed in a residential unit with Hakeem, where their parenting skills were monitored. 'Social services decided that they had done enough to keep Hakeem', Mrs Drew said. 'That was another mistake.' By then, Heath was telling friends she had converted to Islam, although she never wore a headscarf or attended the mosque. Mrs Drew, 67, said she was 'incredibly angry' with social services and Hakeem's school for 'failing' the boy. The lollipop lady, also of Nechells, Birmingham, said: 'Social services knew me because they'd been involved for years when I began guardian for Laura's older children. 'The school had my number. They knew where I lived - I'd had to pick Hakeem up in the past when Laura failed to collect him. Why didn't any of them come and tell me there were concerns? 'Hakeem was such a lovely little boy. We all feel as a family that we let him down, but social services and the school let him down the most. 'I had no idea he was missing so much school time.' Jurors heard Heath smoked heroin after putting Hakeem to bed for the final time. Mr Brook told the jury that Heath's 'use of asthma equipment to smoke drugs is a metaphor for her neglect of her child, symbolising her prioritisation of her own needs over his safety.' A neighbour heard tapping at his window in the early hours, but saw nothing in the darkness, the trial heard.  Hakeem's body was found just after 7.30am later that morning by the 51-year-old council tenant Heath had befriended, Tim Busk.  He would later be diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease and passed away three months ago. But relatives told how they discovered his computer and other possessions had vanished in the days following Hakeem's death. Sister-in-law Carol Busk, 60, told the Mail: 'We had no idea Heath and her son were basically living there. 'Tim was already showing symptoms (of Alzheimer's) by then and could just about make himself a cup of tea or beans on toast. 'Heath took Tim's money and his possessions to pay for her drugs. She was exploiting him and his illness for her own benefit.' Heath had earlier pleaded guilty to four counts of child cruelty relating to neglect by failing to provide proper medical supervision, and ill-treatment by exposing Hakeem to drugs. She will be sentenced on all five counts next week. Andy Couldrick, chief executive of Birmingham Children's Trust, said: 'There were some clear missed opportunities, (and) some of them are distressingly familiar in terms of other cases.' He said social workers 'didn't understand the amount of disguise and deception' Heath used to cover her addiction and said agencies failed to seek enough information from each other. He added: 'At the sharpest point was the child protection conference on Friday before the weekend of his death. 'That conference should have happened earlier...it should have led to more immediate action.'  A serious case review examining the circumstances of Hakeem's death is due to be published later this year. Heath left her son to die alone in a freezing garden in Birmingham after he got out of bed to get some fresh air. Jurors were told how she would 'source heroin and crack cocaine' as her 'first priority in life' ahead of the welfare of her young son. Shocking images released by police showed how Heath had used Hakeem's inhalers to smoke class A drugs from despite his breathing getting worse 'day by day.' Hakeem, who was suffering from uncontrolled asthma, was found in the garden at the at around 7.30am on November 26, 2017 but could not be saved by medics. During the month-long trial, the court had heard how Hakeem's death could have been completely avoided. He was also made to sleep on a sofa in squalid conditions, while his jumper smelled of urine and his school uniform reeked of cigarettes. Prosecutor Jonas Hankin QC said: 'Hakeem found himself powerless in a perfect storm where he had not been given his preventer medication. His lungs were in a poor condition and he was being put into adverse environments - cold, smoky and dirty environments.  'What chance did Hakeem have with his mother and her priorities? His death was avoidable. His death was a needless, premature death. Had it not been for her conduct Hakeem would still be alive. There can't be a greater breach of parental duty than that.' Hakeem was known to social services and was classed as 'vulnerable' due to concerns about 'neglect, attendance issues and his home life'. A child protection meeting was held two days before his death where a school nurse had warned Hakeem was at risk of dying and should be removed from his mum. But it was decided he should not be removed from his Heath's care despite his being as a 'serious risk of harm.' Following the meeting Heath messaged a friend saying: 'Hakeem is on child protection... neglect... hey ho... gonna do what I gotta do.' Prosecutors said Heath mismanaged Hakeem's asthma as she disengaged with social workers and school staff during 2017.  She was accused of prioritising her spiralling drug habit over her son's health, even resorting to sex work to fund it, the court heard. The jury were told the gas and electric were turned off at her 'chaotic' and 'messy' home in Long Acre, Nechells, resulting in her going to stay at an address in nearby Cook Street where Hakeem died. Heath had told police after her arrest that Hakeem would go outside for some fresh air if he was ever struggling with his breathing. She said in her police interview after his death: 'I had a funny feeling he had gone out in the night and fell asleep outside.' Dr Roger Malcomson a consultant paediatric pathologist who conducted an autopsy on Hakeem in December 11, 2017 at Coventry Mortuary, found that Hakeem's lungs were 'hyperexpanded.' He told the court during trial: 'Hakeem's lungs were so hyperexpanded that the lungs overlapped the heart which is not normal. 'The lungs were in a different position compared to that of a normal person.'",
  "00215038f1c9f2bf9924d486bb502bd32ae0e6305e588ae9636ef85d": "Police searching for missing Burnley mother-of-two Katie Kenyon today set up tents at a new patch of woods after receiving a tip-off about the van she was last seen in six days ago - as her ex-boyfriend entered no plea as he appeared in court today charged with her murder. Ms Kenyon, 33, was last seen at around 9.30am on Friday when it is thought she travelled in a van which left Burnley towards the Bolton-by-Bowland area of north Lancashire. At lunchtime today, two blue forensic tents were put up in a spot in Gisburn Forest, Lancs, as the search continued. Typically the structures can be used to protect forensic evidence, but may also be staked out to provide cover for equipment. In the afternoon, police revealed that a member of the public had reported a sighting of the van Ms Kenyon is thought to have travelled in. Police are now prioritising an area in the Forest of Bowland as they continue to search for the missing mother-of-two. Andrew Burfield, 50, was charged on Wednesday with her murder and was before Blackburn Magistrates' Court at 10am. He entered no plea and will appear at Preston Crown Court tomorrow. The family of care worker Ms Kenyon, from Padiham, have thanked well wishers for their support but have asked that people respect their privacy. More than 60 specialist search officers from four police forces have been scouring an area of dense forest land in Lancashire looking for Ms Kenyon. The hunt involved police and fire service officers, dog teams, mounted police, mountain rescue volunteers and drones. Police have today confirmed that the search, which was provisionally scheduled to go on until at least Friday, is still continuing.    Scores of officers were yesterday seen scouring the 3,000-acre Gisburn Forest in the Ribble Valley, some 23 miles from Todmorden Road, in Ms Kenyon's home town of Burnley, where she was last seen parking her white Ford Fiesta at 9.15am on Friday. Detective Superintendent Gary Brooks, Lancashire Police's Head of Major Crime, had said on Tuesday: 'We are continuing to search a number of different locations in connection with this investigation, including at Gisburn Forest and I am grateful to colleagues from Merseyside and North Wales, and other emergency service partners who are offering assistance in the these complex and wide-scale searches. 'I am aware that many members of the public have offered to help us in those searches and while I am grateful for that I would dissuade anyone from doing so.  'The area we are searching is very large and remote with no phone signal.  'The police teams are trained professionals who are used to doing this sort of work and I would hate for someone to get lost or come to harm while trying to help. Please leave it to us.' Forces from across the north west had been drafted in to help the search, which is expected to last until at least Friday. Police on horseback were on patrol across the many footpaths that weave through the woods. ",
  "5f6e6fcd8d9ecdd4297143132e00651d0aa96cc80d9d4449cb13b070": "Two M25 petrol stations has finally reopened seven hours after eco zealots targeted them in the latest protests from Just Stop Oil.  A total of 35 people have been arrested following the action that included activists gluing themselves to the pumps, to forecourt signs and to vehicles on Cobham Services in Surrey and Clacket Lane Services in Tatsfield. 'John Lennon lookalike' Louis McKechnie who has already been jailed over climate protests was able to lead a mob that blocked two M25 petrol stations for five hours during rush hour before smashing up the pumps.  He spent a month and a half in prison for blocking the motorway last year, but today ignored the threat of more jail time to vandalise petrol pumps using a mallet and an aerosol can.  The graduate has a sprawling criminal history, and was earlier this month banned from attending football games after invading the pitch during an Everton vs Newcastle match and using a cable tie to bind his neck to a goalpost.  Today, the 22-year-old crowed at having successfully 'disabled' the pumps at Cobham Services in Surrey.  He was part of a rag tag mob of 40 Just Stop Oil activists who descended on Cobham Services and the Clacket Lane Services in Kent at around 7am, before sitting outside the entrances and gluing themselves to the tarmac.  It took until 2pm when Surrey Police announced 40 officers had cleared the demonstrators from the forecourts - but again face questions about why they did not act faster to remove the group, who have vowed to continue causing hell to drivers at further stunts in the coming weeks. The force said it has to use specialist de-bonding equipment to remove the protesters.  But motorists have not been saved from disruption with a total of 35 pumps damaged at Cobham Services, and a further 20 pumps damaged at Clacket Lane. Another activist, 22-year-old Coventry student Nathan McGovern, has also been regularly arrested carrying out illegal stunts and was today filmed smashing petrol pumps.  He spoke in a grandiose video address uploaded to the Just Stop Oil twitter account this morning, where he accused the government of 'genocide' for not doing enough to tackle global warming.  Stephanie Golder, a 34-year-old charity project coordinator from Essex, claimed to be 'sick and tired of being treated like a criminal' - as her accomplices destroyed a petrol pump in an blatant act of criminal damage.  Motorists hit back by blasting the 'clueless' demonstrators and demanded ministers 'please get on top of this issue' to prevent further disruption to the public.   Just Stop Oil claim 1,000 activists have been arrested since the start of the month, when they blocked a series of oil terminals in a move that was partially blamed for pushing up petrol prices.  Surrey Police said the stunts had caused 'considerable disruption' and 'huge financial loss' with the pumps switched off and motorists being diverted away from both stations. It came as another group of Just Stop Oil protest held a third day of protests outside the Kingsbury Oil Terminal in a potential breach of an injunction banning demonstrations at the site.  Eight activists were arrested and face a potential charge of contempt of court. Ten other protesters arrested outside Kingsbury yesterday will appear at Birmingham Magistrates' Court today.  The maximum penalty is a prison sentence of two years or an unlimited fine.  Superintendent Graham Barnett said: 'Police responded after reports that pumps were being smashed up and that protesters were gluing themselves to pumps, vehicles and forecourt signs. 'We appreciate that this caused considerable disruption to motorists attempting to use the services and to the petrol stations themselves, who will also have suffered a huge financial loss as a result of this activity. 'All protesters have now been removed and 35 people are in custody. Both forecourts have reopened but unfortunately a large number of pumps have been damaged which means they have not currently in use. However, the HGV pumps were not targeted and are still open for lorry drivers. 'We do appreciate that this incident has taken some time to resolve but given the circumstances, we were required to use officers trained in using specialist de-bonding equipment to safely remove the protesters, and this is a lengthy and complex process. 'Officers are also required to act within the law and are accountable for the decisions they make and the tactics they use. 'While we are required to facilitate peaceful protest, we will always take action against those who break the law and significantly impact on the lives and livelihoods of others, and clearly if officers are caught up dealing with protest activity, they aren't elsewhere preventing crime and responding as quickly to reports from the public.' Nathan McGovern, 22, a student from Coventry taking part in the demonstration, said: 'The world's most vulnerable are dying from a fossil-fuelled nightmare right now, whilst our government proposes to drill for more oil and gas. 'I refuse to stand by and watch as heatwaves and drought murder people across the global South and families in the UK are forced to choose between eating and heating.  'If politicians and bureaucrats refuse to act then it falls on ordinary people to do what they will not.'  In a video uploaded to the @JustStop_Oil Twitter account, he says: 'I'm Nathan, I'm 22 years old, and just now this morning myself and others have blocked the entrance to the forecourt of this petrol station and disabled the petrol station. 'None of us want to be here, none of us want to be doing this, none of us want to be disrupting the lives of the public but the criminal inaction on the climate crisis from our government has forced us into this.' He adds: 'This is madness, it is utterly genocidal.'  In a survey of 5195 Drivers online by FairFuelUK - a campaign group advocating for better petrol and diesel prices - 94% want petrol and diesel supplies to have legal protection in law, with interuption by protesters to get long sentences.  And 89% want the police to get tougher on the Stop Oil Protesters, 61% want longer custodial sentences, 81% want protesters' assets to be confiscated and 86% want minimum fines of PS10,000 each Howard Cox, founder of FairFuelUK said: 'Time this less than remotely resembling anything like a Conservative Government put the clueless self-obsessed amoebic Stop Oil protesters in jail. 'Millions are repulsed by these middle-class, privileged and well-off good-for-nothings ruining decent hard working people's lives.  'People are being savaged in the Ukraine and we are on the verge of a world war but this bunch of lunatics are hell bent on following an ill-informed myopic ideal that will not make a shed load of difference to the planet's environmental future.  Our police must be given stronger powers, by the Home Secretary, to protect the fuel supply chain and the law abiding mass majority needing to earn a living just to survive this' devastating cost of living crisis.' Protester Stephanie Golder said: 'I'm sick and tired of being treated like a criminal for standing up for what is right.  'The real criminals are those refusing to act on the climate emergency, it's truly genocidal for our government to give new licences for oil exploration. 'The poorest in this country need help with their energy bills now. But instead the government's energy strategy fails to mention energy saving measures such as insulation and instead prioritises a ''plan'' which puts us on a fast-track for climate chaos.' 'The supporters of Just Stop Oil will continue the disruption until the government makes a statement that it will end new oil and gas projects in the UK,' the group said. 'The Just Stop Oil Coalition is calling on all of those whose futures are being destroyed, who are facing poverty now, and who are outraged at yet another betrayal by this continuing dependence on oil and gas, to step up and take action.'  Just Stop Oil described the sabotage of petrol pumps as 'a significant escalation'.  Surrey Police said earlier today: 'Further arrests are likely to be made throughout the day as officers with specialist removal equipment are working to ensure that all protesters are removed safely, after a number of them glued themselves to pumps and signs on the petrol station forecourts. One of them has also glued himself to the top of a lorry. 'Officers were called to Clacket Lane Services around 7.02am following reports that a group of protesters had turned up.  'A further call was received around 7.06am that protesters were on site at Cobham Services petrol station and were damaging the pumps. 'The pumps have all been switched off and motorists were diverted away from both service stations.  'We appreciate the considerable disruption this is causing and we are working as quickly as we can to remove the protesters safely from the site and allow both petrol stations to re-open.  'Please bear with us while we continue to deal with these ongoing incidents.'  The move is reminiscent of Insulate Britain's protests between September and November last year, when M25 junctions were repeatedly blocked. Just Stop Oil began its protests on April 1. It has carried out a series of blockades of fuel terminals in south-east England and the Midlands, and targeted several high-profile football matches. More than 1,000 arrests have been made. The group said it will 'continue the disruption until the Government makes a statement that it will end new oil and gas projects in the UK'. Ten supporters arrested outside Kingsbury oil terminal on Wednesday are due to appear at Birmingham Magistrates' Court on Thursday. They are charged with contempt of court relating to an injunction granted to North Warwickshire Borough Council which prohibited protests at the site. By Martin Robinson for MailOnline  The green zealots trying to make Britain run out of fuel are a bunch of privileged students and professional protesters, MailOnline revealed earlier this month. Activists from Just Stop Oil have been hampering access to petrol and diesel, demanding that the Government stops new fossil fuel projects by digging tunnels below refineries, vandalising tankers or storming the terminals to climb on to the pipes. Essex Police has arrested hundreds of protesters since the disruption started on April 1 - while queues have formed at petrol stations across the country and some have even shut down due to a shortage of fuel.  One of the ringleaders is 'John Lennon lookalike' Louis McKechnie, a Bournemouth University graduate last seen 'surfing' on an oil truck in Essex on Friday. He became a poster boy for JSO after he tied himself to a goalpost to disrupt a Premier League at Everton last month.  Around 12 students were within the pipes at Grays Inter Terminal two weeks ago, including former boarding school choir girl and now Cambridge University student Cressie Gethin. With her in the rafters is student Nathan McGovern, another golden boy of the movement. Also manning the barricades were Brighton-based activist Hannah Hunt, 23, another student with a taste for expensive hobbies and travel, and Eben Lazarus, who describes himself as a 'musician and activist'.  And in the tunnels below the BP Kingsbury Oil Terminal in Warwickshire were retired vicar Tim Hewes, a veteran of the Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain movement who also sewed his lips together in protest against Rupert Murdoch.  Other members of the Just Stop Oil group, which is closely linked to the Extinction Rebellion, Animal Rebellion and Insulate Britain groups, is a rollerskating watchmaker and JSO's official 'de-escalator', XR's 'arts co-ordinator' and a Welsh organic farmer whose family business failed and he blamed climate change. These are the protesters at the heart of the current chaos that is leaving millions of Britons short on fuel: The Lennon-lookalike posterboy: Louis McKechnie  Louis McKechnie, 21, an engineering student, was charged with pitch encroachment and aggravated trespass after the incident at Goodison Park during the game between Everton and Newcastle United. He stormed the pitch halfway through the match and zip-tied himself to the goalpost wearing a bright orange t-shirt saying: 'Just stop oil.' Louis said he has received 'hundreds' of death threats since running on to the pitch.   McKechnie is a Bournemouth University student whose activism began with Extinction Rebellion (XR) in 2020 before he joined vegan group Animal Rebellion. The 21-year-old, whose experience of work appears to be only stints with a local fish-and-chip shop and supermarket, was one of the 'Highway Nine' Insulate Britain protesters jailed for blocking the M25 last year.  After serving half of a three-month prison sentence, he warned: 'What comes next will make Insulate Britain look like child's play.'  Rebel reverend: Tim Hewes Reverend Hewes, who once sewed up his lips in protest at the influence of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, was also repeatedly part of the mob blocking the M25 despite already being arrested numerous times. The activist has 'permission to officiate' in the Diocese of Oxford although he does not have a parish, and was earlier this month in tunnels under an oil tanker route. Asked about Rev Hewes last year, a spokesman for the diocese said: 'The actions of Rev Hewes and others, while arguably well-intentioned, have frustrated many people and we're unclear how the actions have been productive in encouraging the urgent change required.' Rev Hewes, a retired dentist, previously said the Bishop of Dorchester, Gavin Collins, who comes under the Diocese of Oxford, had told him 'he does support issues regarding climate change and the environment but not about breaking the law'. He was two weeks ago in a tunnel under a key tanker route to the BP Kingsbury Terminal in Warwickshire.  He said: 'I'm here because our government is useless, they make a lot of noise but they are doing nothing. 'As a priest I have a duty of care for people, and also for creation. What I'm doing here, with everyone in this caravan, is what our government should be doing - that is trying to protect our families and our loved ones from the appalling future that stands before us. 'I hope we can continue what we're doing and stop the flow of oil, if the government won't.' The jetsetting yachtswoman: Hannah Hunt The JSO protester is from Brighton, a common home town for Green zealots. Miss Hunt is a former XR supporter who broke into an ExxonMobil Oil refinery in Hampshire. She also posed with Mr McKechnie outside Downing Street with a letter for Boris Johnson. She also glued herself to the red carpet at the Bafta awards and admits to experiencing severe anxiety before a protest. But describing her state after starting she said she enjoys 'a weird, dreamy, calm mindset' she finds empowering. The Brighton-based activist studied at Sussex University, where she joined the sailing team. Her Instagram shows her holidaying in locations including Australia, Greece, Gran Canaria and Bali. She was last month in the rafters of the Grays refinery, with Eben Lazarus, a musician and activist also from Brighton. Sharing a video she said they were 'cold and uncomfortable' 17 hours into their protest, but added: 'But that suffering is minute compared to those in the frontline of the climate crisis'. Eben then encourages people to 'step up' and join protests because 'nobody can be a bystander if we want any chance of a future'.   XR's 'arts-co-ordinator': Indigo Rumbelow   Eco-fanatic Indigo Rumbelow, 27, from Gower, South-West Wales, has been arrested at least five times. In a Zoom call watched by The Mail on Sunday, she told activists: 'We want to create sustained disruption for two weeks.'    Describing her motivations, Miss Rumbelow said: 'My generation is being forced into action because our Government is destroying our future. We will immediately end all actions when it makes a statement that it will stop all new oil and gas.'  Indigo was first arrested at Cannes Lions Advertising Festival in 2019 for gate-crashing a Facebook conference and has been held by police on at least six occasions since then. In 2020 she began digging up the lawn in front of the Ministry for Housing Communities and Local Government and was arrested again in Parliament Square later that year when she blocked the road.  Justifying her behaviour recently she said: 'The only thing to do in a system that is driving itself to extinction is to rebel. If we look at the history books, we can see that the only way of creating the nonlinear change we need is for people to commit civil disobedience and force that change. 'Currently too few people are taking the necessary action. I urge anyone reading this article to realise that they too can rebel. In order to prevent ecosystem and societal collapse, at this pivotal moment in history, ordinary people need to take extra-ordinary action'. The rollerskating watchmaker: Amy Rugg-Easey Miss Rugg-Easey was involved in shutting down Tower Bridge on April 8. She and an unnamed man threw themselves off the bridge using abseil ropes and tiers a giant 'End fossil fuels now' banner.   The Labour-voting voting watchmaker and rollerskater from Newcastle upon Tyne describes herself as a 'rebel for life'. Describing her descent into eco-activism she said: 'I quit my career in watchmaking to study environmental science after listening to science podcasts while working at my bench. I remember thinking at the time 'it can't be that bad'. Climate change was something that you heard about every now again in the news as if it was the weather. When I really started to look at the facts, I started to panic. I felt a need to do something about it. When I began my degree, I had already been to a few Extinction Rebellion meetings and their famous 'heading for extinction' talk. 'It can't be that bad' I thought. I'd hoped that when I started studying, the things I would learn would show that that talk had been a huge exaggeration. Unfortunately, that was not the case'.  Describing the abseiling stunt she said: 'I was terrified stepping off that bridge. I decided to put my name out and wear my signature blue jacket hoping that people I've met would recognise me and realise that climate activists are just normal people too. I also know that it creates a target on my back. Certain people will wish that I'd died on that bridge today. I know that it makes my mum worry. 'I'm hoping my actions inspires others to be brave and take their first steps in fighting for our future. Not everyone has to hang off a bridge and get arrested, but everyone has to take meaningful action for things to change'. The Cambridge music student: Cressie Gethin  Miss Gethin, a former student of the prestigious Hereford Cathedral School, was among the group holding up the Grays refinery. She appears to be one of the five main founders of Just Stop Oil.  Cressie, a music student from Murray Edwards at Cambridge University, has been campaigning on climate issues at her college.  She told The Tab: 'I was very very surprised that Murray Edwards came out bottom of the league tables for their climate policies because I had imagined it was something they would have cared about and been active on'. The talented chorister has performed with her brother, also a singer.   The LBC mic gluer: Nathan McGovern The Coventry activist has flirted with XR and Animal Rebellion and disrupted a game at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.  He spoke to Tom Swarbrick in LBC's Westminster studio when he glued his hand to the microphone at around 11.40am. Mr McGovern said that the station was 'not using' its 'massive platform' to inform listeners of the dangers of the climate crisis Speaking live, Mr McGovern said to Mr Swarbrick: 'You have a massive platform, a microphone that you can use to tell people about the situation we're in and you're not using it. 'An ordinary person like me is having to take the microphone and tell your viewers the situation we are in.' The LBC presenter said: 'For those of you listening wondering what the banging on the microphone is, Mr McGovern seems to have, you've glued yourself to the microphone? That's fantastic.' After the incident, LBC presenter and Daily Mail columnist Andrew Pierce took over the live programme from Global's Leicester Square, before handing back to Mr Swarbrick when arrived there. During this time, Mc McGovern was left in the studio in the dark while waiting for police to arrive. He appeared as a spokesperson for Animal Rebellion advocating a 'plant-based food system' on Nigel Farage's GB News show in October 2021. After the disruption, the group tweeted: 'Every new oil and gas facility tightens the noose around the necks of our young people. If the media will not communicate their predicament they will have no choice but to take the microphone.' Just Stop Oil's 'de-escalator': Pavel Ivanov Mr Ivanov is reported to diffuse rows that break out at the protests when JSO's members shut down roads, for example. A Guardian report described the  'astonishing' abuse they suffer, in a tacit admission that they are struggling to win over many of their critics. In one incident linked to the blockading of oil refineries, one driver who had protesters on his roof said: 'If the police weren't here, I'd come up and f**king throw you off myself.' Another activist with a ladder was told: 'You put that up there, mate, and I'm going to ram it down your f**king throat'. Mr Ivanov claims n one occasion someone got him by the throat as friends were heckled: 'You look like you're just out of nappies. Go and get a f**king job'.  JSO's graphic designer who won't have a baby until she tries to 'fix the world':  Gabriella Ditton Another JSO activist is graphic designer Gabriella Ditton, 27, from Norfolk, who was arrested for blocking oil trucks on Friday.  In a newspaper interview, Ms Ditton - who attended Wymondham College in Norfolk, where annual boarding fees are more than PS12,000 - bragged: 'I've been arrested 16 times and it's honestly fine.' She has stripped naked and covered her body in oil at protests. The group said: 'Gabriella would love nothing more than to have a family and continue her career as a graphic designer, but feels those things aren't an option for her anymore because of the state of the world'. The 27-year-old, who works as an animator, became hooked after going to an Extinction Rebellion talk. She said: 'I was getting my life in order to have a baby and went to the Heading for Extinction talk. I realised I couldn't bring a baby into the world before trying to fix it first. 'I started the way everyone does, with petitions, emailing my MP, going on marches. But I realised it doesn't work. In the future, I want to be able to say with total sincerity that I did everything I could and really mean it. I'm so frightened about society falling apart - I'm so deadly terrified that I will do literally anything to prevent it from happening'. Organic farmer and XR co-founder who branded the Holocaust 'just another f**kery in human history': Roger Hallam Roger Hallam is the co-founder of Extinction Rebellion who believes paralysing traffic will eventually cause food shortages and trigger uprisings. He once stood unsuccessfully in the 2019 European Parliament election in the London constituency as an independent, winning 924 of the 2,241,681 votes cast, which was around 0.04 per cent of the vote. He became interested in climate change in his 40s when an organic farm he ran in south Wales went bankrupt because of extreme weather conditions. Hallam went on hunger strike in 2017 to demand King's College London stop investing in fossil fuels. His stated ambition for the group is to 'bring down all the regimes in the world and replace them', starting with Britain. He encouraged his followers to get arrested at demonstrations en-masse as a way of raising awareness of climate change. In a recent video on YouTube, he said protesters should be ready to cause disruption through personal 'sacrifice'. If necessary, they 'should be willing to die'. In 2019 he apologised for comments he made describing the Holocaust as 'just another f**kery in human history'. Hallam, 55, sparked outrage in Germany by comparing the murder of six million Jewish people at the hands of the Nazis to other historical massacres and claiming that the memory of the Shoah - or Holocaust - was holding Germany back. The former organic farmer was quickly condemned by Extinction Rebellion groups in Germany, as well as the German government after his comments to a newspaper in the country. ",
  "3fa33689843f1fa6f22feba41afee8f86ebe026c2ff9b24081e63785": "Boris Johnson lashed out at one of his own MPs accused of watching pornography in the House of Commons today, hinting he faces being kicked out of the Conservative Party.  The Prime Minister said the behaviour alleged by several female MPs was 'totally unacceptable' as he made a campaign visit to Burnley. Cabinet members said the culprit should be stripped of the whip or even kicked out of the House if they the allegations are proven.  But former minister Caroline Nokes has accused the chief whip of kicking the issue 'into the long grass', and said the whip should have been suspended already.  Speaking to reporters in Lancashire, Mr Johnson was asked whether the parliamentarian would lose the Conservative whip if the allegations are proven. 'I think it's obviously unacceptable for anybody to be doing that kind of thing in the workplace,' he said. 'It would be the same for any kind of job up and down the country, let's be absolutely clear about that. 'What needs to happen now is that the proper procedures need to be gone through, the independent complaints and grievances procedure needs to be activated and we need to get to understand the facts, but, yeah, that kind of behaviour is clearly totally unacceptable.' It came as the sleaze issue crossed the aisle, with a Labour frontbencher accused of telling one of his party's female MPs they were a 'secret weapon' because men wanted to sleep with them. The female politician - who wants to remain anonymous - was allegedly subjected to the lewd remark at an event in Westminster. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace also urged MPs to stay out of Parliament's 'poisonous' drinking dens amid growing uproar at sexism and sleaze at Westminster. Mr Wallace said the long hours and access to alcohol had been a problem for many years, and his advice to colleagues was 'finish your day's work and go home'. In the latest grim claims, a woman MP told BBC Wales that when someone praised her as a 'rising star' of her party at an event, the unnamed shadow cabinet minister intervened.  They apparently said she was a 'secret weapon' because 'women want to be her friend' and men wanted to sleep with her. 'She is a vote winner,' they reportedly added. Keir Starmer said: 'I'm deeply concerned to hear these suggestions and these allegations. 'There is a complaints procedure and I want everybody to have the confidence to use that complaints procedure because I would want to get to the bottom of this and do something about it.' A Labour spokeswoman said: 'The Labour Party takes all complaints extremely seriously.    'They are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures, and any appropriate action is taken.' It is understood that no complaint has been received, and BBC Wales said the woman did not want to be identified for fear of consequences.  Labour has recently introduced a new independent complaints procedure to boost confidence, and is encouraging people to come forward. In a round of interviews this morning, Mr Wallace said 'there's no place for pornography in any workplace' and said there needs to be a cultural change in Westminster. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I certainly think they should lose the whip.' He pointed to the handful of exclusive bars on the Parliamentary estate, where drinks are much cheaper than outside, with a pint of beer costing around PS3.60. Mr Wallace told Times Radio that there were 'fights', 'sexist comments' and 'propositions' in the bars.  'What I have witnessed is, what I think is the fundamental problem of Westminster, is the overall culture is that hundreds and hundreds of people (are) working long hours in a place with bars,' he said. 'And for some people, under lots of pressure for all sorts of reasons. And that... mix becomes poisonous.'  Mr Wallace said the problems had been 'going on for decades' and were 'not easy to fix'.  'I mean, my advice to any MP is actually avoid the bars, you know, finish a day's work and go home.  'But you know, that is part of the ultimate challenge around parliament that I think needs to be fixed.  'And you know, in the Armed Forces, I have a similar challenge, which is often in those high pressure environments where people mix and then alcohol is consumed, you end up in a place where people do things, either they regret, or things that is totally unacceptable.'  The Defence Secretary told Sky News: 'There is a range of allegations that go right across the House, go right across the parties. 'This is a problem, I think, about the overall culture of the House of Commons. 'It is late sitting, long nights with bars, and that very often leads, and it has done for decades, to behavioural challenges... 'I think it's really important that we think about ways to change the culture in the House of Commons.' Attorney General Suella Braverman told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour that if the allegation of an MP watching porn in Parliament is proven there should be a 'severe reprimand' including an opportunity to oust them from the Commons. 'I'm shocked and appalled... what would possess them? It is totally unacceptable,' she said. 'I am very glad that the chief whip has now referred it to the independent complaints and grievance process.' Ms Braverman went on: 'I think we would really need to see a situation where the whip would be removed. I am ashamed that this person is carrying the Conservative rosette. 'I think they really do need to be subject to a recall, and no longer holding their privileged position as a member of parliament.' Ms Braverman said while all the men she had worked with were 'respectful' there were MPs who behaved like 'animals'.  'There is however, a very small minority of men - and it is men - who fall short, and there are some bad apples who are out of order, who behave like animals and are bringing parliament into disrepute to be honest,' she said. 'I don't think we should be saying there is a pervasive culture. That is not my experience. There are certain individuals who are behaving in an unacceptable way.'   The Conservative Party's chief whip has ordered an official investigation into claims that an MP was watching porn on his mobile phone in the House of Commons Chamber. A spokesman said the matter would be referred to Parliament's independent complaints and grievance scheme (ICGS). 'Following allegations of inappropriate behaviour in the House of Commons the Chief Whip has asked that this matter be referred to the ICGS. 'Upon the conclusion of any ICGS investigation the Chief Whip will take appropriate action.'  Ms Nokes told PoliticsHome the referral amounted to 'kicking it into the long grass' and it would be 'months before anything is done'. 'It's not shouldering the burden of responsibility of dealing with it, and I think the Chiefs should have dealt with it immediately,' she said.  Sir Keir said the Conservative Party should 'take action now' against the MP. He said: 'I think it's very good that we've got an independent system and obviously that requires anonymity. 'This is an unusual case because the Tory Party knows who this individual is. 'I think that they should deal with it and deal with it sooner rather than later and take appropriate action. 'So, nothing wrong with the independent process, but I think the Tory Party, they know who this is, they should take action now.' Those reported to the body are given automatic anonymity, meaning the Tory MP's name will not be published while he is under investigation. Only witnesses are able to make complaints to the scheme. The body is said to be investigating at least 56 MPs - including three ministers and two shadow ministers - who have been accused of sexual misconduct. Two female MPs say they witnessed their colleague looking at adult images more than once.",
  "2eded63737c9ecc66ae2dd63bceaf6c16cfeaa8355d9bbf358ae0c4d": "Former Doctor Who and Eastenders star Ann Davies has died aged 87. The actress, who was the wife of the late Richard Briers - who starred in The Good Life - and mother to two daughters, passed away on Thursday, her agent has confirmed. Barry Langford tweeted: 'Sadly my lovely client of 34 years Ann Davies passed away yesterday. 'A superb actress with TV credits including #DoctorWho and #TheSculptress, Ann was devoted to her beloved late husband #RichardBriers and their daughters Lucy and Kate. 'She will be very much missed. #RIP Annie.' Davies starred in a string of Doctor Who episodes in the 1960s playing the character of Jenny alongside William Hartnell as the Time Lord, before going on to play teacher Mrs Singleton in Grange Hill during the 1990s.  The actress also appeared in BBC dramas Doctors and Eastenders, as well as acting alongside her husband Richard in a number of television roles prior to his death in 2013.   The couple had lived together in Chiswick, west London, after marrying in 1956 and had two daughters Lucy and Katie. Lucy, 54, plays Mrs Blish in ITV's Endeavour and featured as Mary Bennet in the 1995 BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice.  Ann's husband Richard was known to millions as the lynchpin of three of the most notable sitcoms ever made in Britain - Marriage Lines, The Good Life and Ever Decreasing Circles.  The star, who was also well-known for his Shakespearean roles, had been battling a serious lung condition for years before he died 'peacefully' at his London home in February 2013.  The couple appeared together in films Peter's Friends in 1992 and In the Bleak Midwinter in 1995, as well as a radio adaptation of the television series Brothers in Law. Mr Briers was one of the most popular television sitcom actors of his generation. After leaving school in Surrey with meagre qualifications, Briers flirted with the idea of electrical engineering as a career, before realising that what he really wanted to do was tread the boards, not wire them. He attended RADA from 1954 to 1956, then joined Liverpool Repertory Company. It was while at Liverpool rep that he met Mrs Davies. Theirs would be that rare thing in the theatrical world -- a long, stable and happy marriage.  Following Richard's death, Dame Sheila Hancock described them as a 'wonderful couple'. She said: ''It's really not easy in our profession, but they were a wonderful couple and we were very close to them.'",
  "84d46924bde076c6342a67954ee71fbd6c842c2904480a7cdb8ff167": "Midwifery students at a top Scottish university were taught biological men could get pregnant and trans men could give birth even if they have a penis. MailOnline can reveal the PS9,000-a-year undergraduate course at Edinburgh Napier University included a woke module on caring for 'birthing people'.    In a coursebook that has since been revised, trainee midwives were given detailed instructions on how to treat a male-to-female trans person during childbirth. It is not possible for someone born a man to get pregnant or give birth with current technology or medicine.  The book's introduction stated: 'You may be caring for a pregnant or birthing person who is transitioning from male to female and may still have external male genitalia.' Another section with photo demonstrations detailed how to fit a catheter in a person with a penis and scrotum during labour.  The book also included special instructions for people with prostate glands -- which are exclusive to biological men -- who may feel particular 'discomfort'. Several experts criticised the university, describing the woke course material as 'remarkably ignorant about basic biology, sex and anatomy'.  Bosses at the university have changed the wording to say 'people transitioning from female to male' rather than 'male to female', following the uproar. But all references to handling a penis, prostate gland and other male genitalia remain, according to Reduxx, which first broke the story. The way the manual has been edited creates more confusion because it suggests midwives can expect to treat biological females with penises. Reduxx did not name the university, but MailOnline understands it is Edinburgh Napier -- just one of four in Scotland that offers an undergraduate, accredited midwifery course.  MailOnline has approached Napier repeatedly for comment. Dr Leila Hanna, a private gynaecologist and obstetrician, said universities should focus on teaching midwives 'what's actually doable'. She told MailOnline: 'A lot of things need to be done to arrive at the technology to be able to do that (a biological man giving birth).  'We would have to be able to give men wombs and then put eggs and sperm in there -- I've not seen any publications to say we've arrived at that technology yet. 'Let's focus on improving what we do, and what's doable, but let's not go dreaming of things which are probably not going to happen tomorrow.' Only people who are born female can make eggs, which means it is not possible for a male-to-female trans woman to get pregnant naturally. Only people who are born female can make eggs, which means it is not possible for a male-to-female trans woman to get pregnant naturally. Scientists believe it is theoretically possible to impregnate a trans woman using IVF, when the eggs are fertilised outside the body and then inserted.  But it would require a healthy womb for the child to grow in, and transplant operations are years if not decades away from making that a reality.  There has only ever been one documented case of a womb being transplanted into a trans woman born male-- but she died from complications just months later. Female-to-male transgender people can still get pregnant. But only if they have not had a hysterectomy as part of their transition or have taken hormone-blocking drugs that stop them from producing eggs. There are no definitive figures when it comes to how many transgender people have given birth worldwide, or in Britain. Seventy-five people who identified as male gave birth in Australia in 2020, the most comparable country with data. Scientists believe it is theoretically possible to impregnate a trans woman using IVF, when the eggs are fertilised outside the body and then inserted.  But it would require a healthy womb for the foetus to grow in, and transplant operations are years if not decades away from making that a reality.  There has only ever been one documented case of a womb being transplanted into a trans woman born male -- but she died from complications just months later. Female-to-male transgender people can still get pregnant, provided they have not had a hysterectomy as part of their transition or have taken hormone-blocking drugs that stop them from producing eggs. There are no definitive figures when it comes to how many transgender people have given birth worldwide, or in Britain. Seventy-five people who identified as male gave birth in Australia in 2020, the most comparable country with data. Students on the Napier course said they were handed a 'Skills Workbook' in a module about how to care for patients giving birth last month. It told them on two separate occasions the 'birthing person' may be a biological male.  So students need to be familiar with inserting catheters for people with 'female and male anatomy', it said. A catheter is sometimes fitted during C-sections or when women are given certain drugs which mean they cannot go to the toilet. Section 4.4 of the manual shows several images of a catheter being fitted on a male figurine's penis and scrotum. One instruction says: 'Wrap a sterile swab around the penis and, with the same non-touch technique, retract the foreskin if present.' 'Place sterile towel across the person's thighs, ensuring the scrotal area is covered,' adds another. Different doses of analgesic gel should also be used depending on whether the pregnant person is male or female, the book claims - with 6ml for women and 11ml for men. Students are instructed to take extra care with 'male persons' who have prostate glands, which are exclusive to biological males.  Removing the catheter may provide particular 'discomfort as the deflated balloon passes through the prostate gland', it claimed.  Dr Susan Bewley, emeritus professor in obstetrics and women's health at King's College London, described the coursework as 'puzzling'. She is quoted by Reduxx as saying: 'There are no circumstances whereby qualified midwives can possibly be asked, or be expected, to catheterise a penis as part of their professional work. 'The writers seem to have left school remarkably ignorant about basic biology, sex and anatomy.' According to Reduxx, which describes itself as a 'pro-woman news and commentary' website, the handbook has been edited to remove claims that a biological man can get pregnant. But it now claims that a biological female can have a child even if she has a penis that has been surgically constructed through a phalloplasty, the site claims.  Dr Bewley added: 'A few [female-to-males] undergo genital surgery but, in general, those with a surgically created neo-penis simply cannot get pregnant either because they undergo a hysterectomy as a prelude. 'These materials are the opposite of the high-quality training that patients need from midwives and doctors.  'The project may have arisen from compassion and enthusiasm, but it is worrying that the writers don't seem to know, care about, or check facts.' The three-year midwifery course at Edinburgh Napier costs PS1,820 per year to Scottish students, which is subsidised by the Government. Students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland have to pay PS9,250 annually.",
  "c42a970bfad25d03a8f3463f5ea818434e00e33ec140053e9ed85130": "Maternity services should use 'inclusive' terms like 'chestfeeding' so trans pregnant people aren't offended, a Government-funded report says.  The report, from the LGBT Foundation, made the recommendation after surveying 121 trans Britons on their experience of pregnancy. Another example of a gender-loaded term is 'vaginal birth', recommending 'frontal' or 'lower birth' instead. The report said inclusive terms should be used across NHS services and people and national guidance should be introduced to ensure pregnant trans have the option of their preferred words. 'It is not possible to guess the language someone might use to describe themselves based on how they look or sound, or who they are in a relationship with,' the report reads.  The charity also says some trans and non-binary people would benefit from having a private space in hospitals to give birth, so that they are not made uncomfortable by seeing women.  It detailed the experience of one trans person, who said: 'I didn't have to go to a ward full of women after giving birth, I was actually provided with a private room for me and baby which was very helpful and accommodating for me and my gender identity.'  NHS services are currently in a 'woke' storm of de-gendering language surrounding women and pregnancy.  Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust is now referring to breastmilk as 'human milk' in official guidance. The new report was commissioned by the Health & Wellbeing Alliance, a partnership between charities and the NHS, which is managed jointly by the Department of Health and Social Care and Office for Health Improvement and Disparities. It lays out a series of recommendations in its 'Trans + Non Binary Experiences of Maternity Services' report. The charity said a third pregnant trans and non-nonbinary parents surveyed reported not engaging with perinatal care during their pregnancy. This compares to just 2.1 per cent of  the general population. Of the survey respondents, 59 per cent said healthcare professionals did not speak to them in a way which reflected their gender. Midwifery students at a top Scottish university were wrongly taught biological men could get pregnant and trans men could give birth even if they have a penis. MailOnline can reveal the PS9,000-a-year undergraduate course at Edinburgh Napier University included a woke module on caring for 'birthing people'.    In a coursebook that has since been revised, trainee midwives were given detailed instructions on how to treat a male-to-female trans person during childbirth. It is not possible for someone born a man to get pregnant or give birth with current technology or medicine.

The book also included special instructions for people with prostate glands -- which are exclusive to biological men -- who may feel particular 'discomfort'. Several experts criticised the university, describing the woke course material as 'remarkably ignorant about basic biology, sex and anatomy'.  Bosses at the university have changed the wording to say 'people transitioning from female to male' rather than 'male to female', following the uproar. Additionally, 28 per cent of respondents said they had not been treated with 'dignity and respect' during both labour and birth.   One respondent, described as a disabled, non-binary, queer, Black British African, said: 'I felt there was no framework of language that was inclusive of people who do not identify within the gender binary so it was consistently a triggering experience.' Another trans person said a midwife attributed their postnatal depression to them knowing 'deep down' that they should stop the transition.  'When I suffered from some depression after having my baby a midwife suggested it was because 'deep down I knew I didn't want to transition anymore' this was deeply unhelpful and made me feel even worse,' they said.     And fewer than half of those surveyed said their decisions around how to feed their baby were respected by midwives. This, the LGBT Foundation claimed, 'suggests potential harm for the birthing parent through disrespectful interaction, and to the baby where there are unresolved questions about feeding.' They detailed the experience of another trans person, who said his baby's tongue-tie, a condition where the shape of a child's tongue makes it harder to breastfeed, was missed as medical professionals 'assumed' he could not produce milk. 'My baby's tongue tie was not treated early because it was assumed I wouldn't chest feed at all, when in fact I could have,' he said.  The report's authors also said racism experienced by Black and Asian trans people was also a factor in poorer pregnancy care for these demographics. In its report, the LGBT Foundation name a fictional person called Cam, a 'Black Caribbean non-binary transmasculine person going through their second pregnancy', as an example of how NHS maternity services should be run.  'Cam' had a traumatic first birth where they concealed their gender identity and is, therefore, reluctant to engage with perinatal care services.  The LGBT Foundation list a variety of ways services could be made more inclusive for Cam, such as using language like 'pregnant people' instead of 'pregnant women'. It also recommends the use of terms like 'chestfeeding' or 'bodyfeeding' instead of breastfeeding.  Other examples include having NHS staff with identity badges which show their preferred pronouns, gender-inclusive training for midwives, and NHS data tracking outcomes for trans and non-binary pregnancies. The survey responders were recruited via social media between November 2020 and March 2021 and were then interviewed about their experience by the LGBT Foundation.",
  "b486300eed4fe5ae54e3a7e6e708629763d938724e72f22fc2f9af98": "Defence Secretary Ben Wallace today declared it is 'not the Government's business to run' Channel 4 as ministers pushed on with selling the broadcaster as well as reining in the BBC and Netflix. The TV company has been publicly owned since it was founded by Margaret Thatcher in 1982 - but the Tories are forging ahead with plans to privatise it, claiming public ownership is holding it back from competing with streaming giants. Ministers will today release a blueprint that will also signal the death knell for the licence fee by saying the Government is 'ready to implement a new way of funding the BBC'.   They will also give the UK media watchdog the power to draft and enforce a new video-on-demand code, aimed at setting standards for 'larger TV-like services' such as Netflix, ITV Hub and Now TV to level the rules with traditional broadcasters. The maximum fine for a breach of the code will be PS250,000 or an amount up to 5% of their revenue, whichever is higher. Mr Wallace has said he feels Channel 4 produces some 'great creative content' but that it is 'not the Government's business to run a television channel'. He spoke as the Government releases a White Paper which provides a first look at proposed plans for the channel to be privatised. Speaking to ITV News, Mr Wallace said: 'It'll be good for it. Channel 4 will be able to commission or actually produce its own work, not just commission from other people or productions. 'It will allow it to raise funds in a way that it can't do when it's a nationalised organisation. It will be allowed to compete and produce further good programming.' Today's white paper promises a 'golden age' of programming and make the British broadcasting system 'fit for the streaming age', including:  The BBC's Director General says the Corporation's attempt to claw back young viewers is set to end as it fights with streaming services to reclaim older audiences. The broadcaster had made vigorous efforts to attract the vaunted 16-34 demographic since former BBC boss Lord Hall of Birkenhead instigated a 'lurch to youth' in 2020. Programmes beloved by an older generation, including Eggheads, had budgets slashed or were axed entirely amid a rush to prioritise the 'lives and passions' of younger viewers. After these changes, a 2020 Ofcom report found satisfaction levels with the BBC were waning among older and more middle class viewers.  But this week, Director General Tim Davie insisted the corporation's core channels, BBC One and BBC Two, should be appealing to as wide an audience as possible. He said: 'I don't believe in a big lurch to youth in the BBC. We need to be healthily paranoid about making sure we give value to people aged 16 to 34, and 16 and under for children's provision, but I don't think it means you have to skew everything young in any shape or form. 'Good quality news, outstanding natural history and dramas are often liked by [young viewers].'   Ben Wallace added that he felt the broadcaster produced 'some great creative stuff' but that some of its content 'could be perfectly done by any commercial thing'. But while visiting Workington in Cumbria, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer was asked if it was right for Channel 4 to be privatised, and he said it was wrong - although admitted that voters were preoccupied with other matters. He said: 'No, it isn't right that Channel 4 should be privatised, there's no case for it. 'But, I have to say as I go round Workington and other places, nobody is talking to me about Channel 4, they're all talking to me about the fact they can't pay their bills. 'On behalf of all of them I'd say to the Government, for heaven's sake, focus on the things that people are really concerned about - paying the bills, the tax hike the Government has imposed on you - not privatising Channel 4.' The Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries has taken aim at the BBC today. She said the current model is 'completely outdated' and that in the coming months ministers would be 'looking very seriously about how we fund the BBC'.  Mrs Dorries said she was also considering how media regulator Ofcom could 'hold the BBC to account'.  In January she had appeared to indicate the end of the licence fee when she said the latest funding deal would be its last, before subsequently toning down her remarks.  But in a new interview with The Spectator she once again appeared to signal that the TV licence system of funding the corporation would be killed off.  'We are going to very soon announce that we are going to be looking very seriously about how we fund the BBC,' she said.  Mrs Dorries added that decisions about the matter will be taken 'well ahead' of the corporation's charter renewal at the end of 2027, saying: 'We are ready to implement a new way of funding the BBC.'  She told the magazine: 'We're going to be looking at how Ofcom hold the BBC to account and then very shortly after that we will be announcing other measures that we are going to put into place to start looking at how the BBC will be funded in the future so that we are well in time to have that in place for the charter renewal.'  A broadcasting white paper released today is expected to say that the Government will carry out a review of the licence fee funding model ahead of the next charter period, with more detailed plans laid out in the coming months.  In January, Mrs Dorries confirmed that the licence fee would be frozen at PS159 for the next two years, before increasing by roughly 10 per cent over the following four years.  At the same time she said on social media that this licence fee announcement 'will be the last'.  She had also heralded an end to the 'days of the elderly being threatened with prison sentences and bailiffs knocking on doors' over non-payment of the licence fee. But she later softened her public approach, saying in Parliament that it was 'time to begin asking really serious questions about the long-term funding model of the BBC'.  A Whitehall source said yesterday that 'no decision has been made on what the BBC's future funding model will look like'.  The Culture Secretary has previously criticised the BBC's 'elitist' and 'snobbish' approach and has accused the corporation of having too few working-class staff. Among possible alternatives to the licence fee are some form of voluntary subscription model like Netflix uses, or allowing the BBC to have advertising, or through a general broadband levy.  There have also been suggestions about linking a charge to people's council tax - which generally increase with wealth rather than being a flat rate - while others have proposed a hybrid model which combines more than one of these ideas.  Instead, more general rules about 'reflecting all parts and people of the UK' and 'democratically impactful content' will be brought in.  Most of the current rules do not apply to the BBC because it is governed by its charter, but it affects commercial public service broadcasters such as ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5.  When it was launched by the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1982, Channel 4 was given the remit of appealing to tastes that weren't catered for on the three existing television channels.    Until then, the public broadcaster BBC and its commercial rival ITV had held a duopoly over Britain's TV screens.  The first voice heard on the new channel when it launched on November 2, 1982, was that of continuity announcer Paul Coia. He said: 'Good afternoon. It's a pleasure to be able to say to you welcome to Channel Four.' After a montage of clips that were played to the sound of the channel's signature tune, the first show to air was an episode of quiz show Countdown that was presented by Carol Vorderman and Richard Whiteley. Previously, Countdown had only aired in pilot form before being bought by Channel 4. The first advert to air on the channel was for car maker Vauxhall. On its first day, the channel also broadcast soap opera Brookside, which was created by Phil Redmond. In the 1980 Broadcasting Act, the Government said Channel 4, which was headed up by chief executive Jeremy Isaacs, would have to provide 'a suitable proportion of matter calculated to appeal to tastes and interests not generally catered for.' The channel was also asked to screen 'educational' programmes which 'encourage innovation and experiment'. As well as Countdown and Brookside, Channel 4 also became known for hit comedy Father Ted, late night show The Word and many other popular programmes.  More recent shows, including the likes of Naked Attraction and Sex Box, have attracted criticism from some viewers for allegedly being inappropriate.  The former is a dating show in which contestants' bodies - including their private parts - are slowly revealed from the feet up. In the latter, couples who featured on the show had sex in a box on stage.  The channel has also been slammed for its alleged left-wing bias in recent years. Channel 4's creation was part of a raft of changes to Britain's media landscape during Mrs Thatcher's time in office.  The changes brought in by Mrs Thatcher also included the launch of breakfast station TV-am and the insistence that independent producers should make much of the shows that were appearing on Britain's television screens. Before the changes, the BBC and ITV had made nearly all their shows in-house. From the outset, Channel 4 was also obligated to get 'a substantial proportion' of its programmes from independent producers. It was funded by advertising and sponsorship deals. Before Channel 4's launch, a government report had concluded that 'the younger generation of producers is bubbling over with ideas which are not allowed to surface.' Writing to mark Brookside's 30th anniversary in 2012, Redmond said Channel 4 'made a huge, immediate impact' because it was given a remit to 'cater for minorities and find voices that were unheard'. 'It certainly lived up to that. It allowed new people to be seen on TV, with new ideas and voices,' he added. However, the channel was hit by controversy after less than 24 hours of being on air, when members of the Deaf Broadcasting Campaign besieged its London headquarters to complain that there was a lack of news programmes for the deaf. The first major drama to air on the channel was Walter, the story of a mentally handicapped man played by Ian McKellen. In recent years, it has become known for its left-leaning coverage. In 2017, it was claimed that former lead presenter Jon Snow joined in a chant of 'F*** The Tories' while attending the Glastonbury festival and in 2019 there was a grovelling apology after the veteran presenter said he had 'never seen so many white people in one place' while reporting on a pro-Brexit rally. And after an attack on two gay women on a London bus, a reporter was accused of 'coaxing' the couple into blaming Boris Johnson for the homophobic crime and saying that he was 'not fit to lead the UK'. In 2019 Ofcom rejected a Conservative complaint over Channel 4's use of an ice sculpture to stand in for the PM during a debate on climate change, after a subtitler mistakenly reported him saying 'people of colour' when he said 'people of talent' at a rally. The channel is also known for its programming for young people and 'property porn' shows such as Grand Designs and Location, Location, Location. It is also home of the Great British Bake Off and known for its groundbreaking drama. Recent show It's A Sin was lauded for its portrayal of the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1980s. Channel 4 is commercially funded. It raised revenues of PS985million in 2019, but a pre-tax loss of PS26million. Selling Channel 4 could be seen as something of an easy win for the Government, as it seeks to find new savings. The taxpayer has a 100 per cent shareholding in Channel 4 but relatively few viewers are even aware that it is state-owned. When proposals to privatise the channel were first raised in 1988, Mrs Thatcher rejected them over fears the broadcaster would be forced to abandon its public service remit. After a series of meetings over the issue, Mrs Thatcher decided that commercial pressures faced by the newly privatised channel would mean its role in catering for underserved audiences and taking risks with new programmes would be threatened. A minute of the meeting that was revealed in Government papers last year read: 'It was extremely doubtful whether the Channel's distinctive remit would be sustained by a profit-driven organisation in a highly competitive climate.' The committee chaired by Mrs Thatcher had also warned that the Government would be vulnerable to a defeat if the privatisation was put to a vote in the Parliament. ",
  "48c908ffa116edad29fda4af8bd3d414b25c9ed0f4f016d89b3d7322": "Boris Johnson is facing a potentially make-or-break moment next week when millions of voters go to the polls across the country. Tories are anxiously waiting to assess the level of damage from the Partygate scandal, with the results in thousands of council seats seen as a key test of whether the PM can survive.  A total of 200 local authorities are holding elections - including every seat in Scotland, Wales and London.  But the outcome could be tricky to interpret as many of the seats were last contested in 2017 and 2018, when the UK was still in the EU, Theresa May was in No10 and Labour was led by Jeremy Corbyn. Experts have pointed out that Labour had a very strong performance in 2018, suggesting the party could struggle to make further big gains - despite polls showing a national lead and massive advantage in London.    Although many of the issues that decide local elections remain the same - such as bin collections and services - they will inevitably be interpreted through the prism of Partygate in the wake of Mr Johnson's fine. Restive Conservatives have been holding off a decision on whether to mount a coup until the results come in, meaning the aftermath is likely to be the moment of maximum danger for the PM.  Meanwhile, a failure to make significant progress could cause serious problems for Keir Starmer.  Here are some of the key contests to look out for in each region of England, as well as in Wales and Scotland. North-west England Bury - estimated declaration time, 8.30pm Friday May 6 Bury has all of its 51 seats up for grabs this year. Labour has run the council since 2011 but has only a small majority and will want to improve its position in what is the party's traditional heartland of Greater Manchester. Bury's status in this year's elections was reflected by the fact Sir Keir and Mr Johnson both visited the town during the campaign. (E) Bolton - 12.30am Friday May 6 Bolton is another key test for Labour in Greater Manchester, but here it is hoping to take back control from the Conservatives who have run a minority administration since 2019. A third of the council's 60 seats are being contested. (12.30am) Pendle - 4.30pm Friday, May 6 Pendle is being defended by the Conservatives, who won a slim majority last year. If the Tories lose two seats, the council will slip back into no overall control. Elections are taking place for 12 of the 33 seats. (4.30pm) Cumberland and Westmorland & Furness - 1pm Friday, May 6  Two new unitary authorities that will elect councillors for the first time this year. The two authorities cover the whole of Cumbria. Cumberland is comprised of the former district councils of Allerdale, Carlisle and Copeland, while Westmorland & Furness covers Barrow-in-Furness, Eden and South Lakeland. All the main parties will be jostling for prominence in these new 'super-councils' and the outcome in both contests could be close. (Cumberland 2.30am, Westmorland & Furness 1pm) North-east England Sunderland - 2am Friday, May 6 Run by Labour since 1973, but both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have made advances in Sunderland in recent years. A third of the council's 75 seats are up for grabs this year, and if Labour suffers six or more losses it will lose overall control. Although Sunderland is part of Labour's so-called 'Red Wall' - areas of the country that saw many Tory gains at the 2019 general election - all three Sunderland MPs are Labour and the party defied predictions in 2021 when it retained its majority on the council.  Hartlepool - 2am Friday, May 6  The Conservatives and Labour are fighting to be in with a chance of taking overall control of the council - or failing that, end up the largest party and lead a minority administration or a coalition. The Tories won the parliamentary seat of Hartlepool from Labour at a by-election in May 2021. A strong showing by independent candidates could spice up the outcome of this year's contest. Some 13 of the council's 36 seats are being contested. Yorkshire & the Humber Kirklees - 6.30pm Friday, May 6 Currently run by Labour but the party does not have a majority in Kirklees. A third of seats are being elected and just two gains by Labour would give it overall control. Both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats are also hoping to do well.  Wakefield - 5pm Friday, May 6 A Labour stronghold and is not likely to change hands, but the party will be hoping for a solid performance ahead of the expected parliamentary by-election in the city later this year, after Conservative MP Imran Khan was convicted of sexual assault. A third of seats are being contested.  Hull - 3.30am Friday, May 6  Hull is a two-way fight between Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Labour's majority has been whittled away in recent years and the party goes into this year's election defending a majority of one. A third of the council's seats are in play and the Lib Dems are hopeful of victory. (3.30am) West Midlands Dudley - 4am Friday, May 6 A crucial test for both the Conservatives and Labour. The Tories hope to build on the slim majority they secured at the 2021 local elections, while Labour will want to halt the blue advance and make gains themselves. A third of the council is up for grabs. (4am) Solihull - 1pm Friday May 6 Another West Midlands metropolitan council under Conservative control, but the main opposition is the Greens. The party has been slowly eating into the Tories' majority and will hope to take a few more bites this year. One third of Solihull's seats are being contested. Nuneaton & Bedworth - 4am Friday May 6 Dominated by the Conservatives after a bumper performance in last year's elections. Labour will hope to demonstrate it is making a comeback, having controlled the council as recently as 2018. Half of the 34 seats are holding ballots. Newcastle-under-Lyme - 3pm Friday May 6 Set to be a battle royal between Labour and the Conservatives, with every council seat up for grabs and the Tories defending a tiny majority. Success here for Labour would suggest the party is winning back support in one of its target areas of country. The parliamentary seat of Newcastle-under-Lyme was won by the Conservatives in 2019 after being held by Labour for the previous 100 years.  East Midlands Derby - 5am Friday May 6 Derby is currently run by the Tories as a minority party. Labour will be looking to make gains in another test of party's ability to win back support in urban areas of central England. An unknown factor is the popularity of the Reform Derby party, based on the former Brexit Party, which is standing candidates in all the seats being contested. There are 17 of the council's 51 seats up for grabs.  Eastern England St Albans - 4pm Friday May 6 St Albans saw the Liberal Democrats make enough gains in 2021 to take overall control, but with a slim majority. The party will want to improve its numbers this year as an example of how it is now the main opposition to the Conservatives in parts of the so-called 'Blue Wall' of southern England. The entire council is up for election. (4pm) Peterborough - 2.30am Friday May 6  A long-running Conservative-Labour battleground and for decades the council has see-sawed between a Tory majority and no overall control. It is currently run by a minority Conservative administration and Labour will want to make gains to show it is recovering in a city it lost to the Tories at the 2019 general election. A third of seats are being contested.  Basildon - 1am Friday May 6 This Essex battleground could provide clues to how the Conservatives are doing in the commuter belt around London. The party won control of the council last year and will hope to consolidate its position in elections for a third of its 42 seats.  Stevenage - 2.30am Friday, May 6 A commuter-heavy area in Hertfordshire, but this time it is Labour who will be hoping to make progress. The party has controlled the council continuously since its creation in 1973 but will want to show it can reverse the losses it made last year. A third of the seats are up for grabs.  London Barnet - 7am Friday May 6 Labour's top target in London for the third election in a row. The party failed narrowly to win control in 2014, while 2018 saw the council swing further towards the Conservatives, with local Labour members blaming the row over antisemitism in the national party. Labour needs to gain nine seats to form a majority. As with every council in London, all seats are being elected.  Wandsworth - 5.30am Friday May 6 Another long-standing Labour target, but here the party managed to increased its number of councillors in both 2014 and 2018. The Tories have held the council since 1978 and have made a point of charging residents one of the lowest average levels of council tax in the country, so a Labour victory would be of symbolic significance.  Hillingdon - 4am Friday May 6  This borough contains the constituency of the Prime Minister and has been controlled by the Conservatives since 2006. Labour is hoping to make gains, but the outcome is hard to predict as the size of the council is being cut from 65 to 53 seats. Westminster - 3am Friday May 6 A flagship borough held by the Tories continuously since its creation in 1964. But Labour has slowly increased its number of councillors at recent elections and will want to make more progress this time. Given the current volatile political climate, plus a reduction in the size of the council from 60 to 54 seats, the final result could be close.  Harrow - 5pm Friday May 6  A council where the reduction in the number of seats from 63 to 55 could work in either Labour or the Conservatives' favour. Labour won a narrow majority in both 2014 and 2018 but the borough's electoral districts have been substantially redrawn for 2022 and both parties could profit from the new-look map.  Sutton - 4am Friday May 6 A Liberal Democrat-Conservative battleground that has been run by the Lib Dems since 1990. The party should retain control again this year, but the Tories will hope to make gains and chip away at the Lib Dems' small overall majority.  South-east England Crawley - 2pm Friday, May 6 Has tilted between Conservative and Labour control in recent years but neither party has an overall majority. It would take only a couple of gains for either the Tories or Labour to take full control of a council deep in the commuter belt of West Sussex. A third of seats are being contested.  Gosport - 5pm Friday May 6 The council sees the Conservatives, who have only a small majority, under pressure from the second-place Lib Dems. All the seats are up for grabs and boundary changes across the borough means the outcome will be even more unpredictable.  Worthing - 2pm Friday May 6 A top Labour target and the party goes into the election level-pegging with the Conservatives on 17 seats each. The Tories currently run the council as a minority administration but Labour has made steady gains in recent years and is hoping to take full control this year. A third of seats are being elected. Southampton - 5am Friday May 6 Another Labour target and winning control from the Conservatives would help demonstrate the party is building back support in southern towns and cities. The Tories are defending a majority of two and a third of the seats are being contested.  South-west England Somerset - 4pm Friday May 6 Undergoing major changes this year in its system of local government. Until now the area has had a county council and four district councils (Mendip, Sedgemoor, South Somerset and Somerset West & Taunton) but these are being scrapped and replaced with a single unitary authority. Elections are taking place for all 110 seats in the new-look organisation, with the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats fighting for control.  Wales Blaenau Gwent - 3pm Friday, May 6 This council has been run by a group of independents since 2017, some of whom used to be in the Labour Party. Labour is keen to take back control and might be helped by a reduction in the number of seats from 42 to 33.  Cardiff - 5pm Friday May 6 A key council for Labour, where the party will hope to defend its slim majority. The number of councillors is being increased slightly from 75 to 79, which might make the outcome more unpredictable.  Flintshire - 3pm Friday May 6  Sits in an area of Wales, the north east, where the Conservatives did well at the 2019 general election. The party won only six council seats in 2017 compared with Labour's 34, so they are hoping to make an advance this year. For its part, Labour will want to remain the largest party and even win a majority, although the total number of seats is being cut from 70 to 67.  Scotland Aberdeenshire - 3pm Friday May 6 A Conservative stronghold, but like many councils in Scotland, power is shared between several parties. All councils in Scotland are elected using the single transferable vote (STV) system, where voters rank candidates and results are based on preferences rather than the winner-takes-all method used in England. This leads to many councils ending in no overall control, but encourages parties to work together either informally or as part of a coalition. The Tories have run Aberdeenshire in partnership with the Lib Dems and a group of Independents. Their success this year may hinge on the popularity in Scotland of the Tories' UK leader Mr Johnson. East Renfrewshire - 2pm Friday May 6 A three-way battle between the Conservatives, Labour and the SNP with each hoping to end up the largest party.  Edinburgh - 3.30pm Friday May 6 The council has been run by a joint SNP-Labour administration for the last five years, but the Conservatives head into this election as the largest party on the council. The Lib Dems and Greens have a smaller number of councillors but both will hope to make gains from the larger parties.  Glasgow - 4pm Friday May 6  The council has been run by the SNP since 2017 in what has been their first stint in control of the city, albeit as a minority administration. The party needs only a few gains to take full control, but Labour - which had previously run the city since 1980 - is keen to stop them. ",
  "96354ccb92fbe959a1199ba2d63e5cb4b4e42fcc65657322b7d195a1": "Sir Ed Davey revealed the pain of having to administer morphine to his terminally ill mother as a child as he opened up about life as a young carer.  The Lib Dem leader was just four when his father John George died and at the age of 12 was left to care for his mother Nina when she was diagnosed with incurable cancer.   Davey, 56, appeared on ITV's Loose Women today where he spoke candidly about his childhood, revealing his mother was sometimes in so much agony she would give herself electric shocks to divert the pain.  The politician currently helps wife Emily care for their daughter Ellie, eight, and son John, 14, who was born with an undiagnosed neurological condition meaning he cannot walk or talk. Speaking about his mother, Nina, Davey said: 'First of all she was mobile, but gradually she was bed ridden and in a lot of pain.  'We used to have to give her morphine for the pain. It was a whole bell jar of morphine.  'Her pain was so bad we had to put these pads on her where she could give herself electric shocks to divert the pain and distract herself. She was in a lot of pain which was where the emotional side came in.'  He revealed that he often felt ostracised growing up because his role as a carer meant he couldn't take part in activities after school.  'At school I think one or two friends knew about it, but there was a sense of slightly being isolated or different,' he said.  'You couldn't always go to the parties, I had to give up rugby. Once or twice I was being bullied because I wasn't joining in. I think a lot of young carers feel that.'  Davey was incredibly close with his grandparents, who along with kindhearted neighbours helped him and his brother cope while caring for his mother.  When his mother died when he was 15, Ed moved in with his brothers and then his maternal grandparents, eventually securing a place at Oxford studying Politics, Philosophy and Economics.  'Previously I had worked to make my mum happy and I went through this rubicon where I thought 'I'm doing this for me now',' he explained.  'It was like a lightbulb, it made me focus on what I wanted to do in life... there was that moment and I think it does focus young minds.'  Davey married Emily Gasson, a former Liberal Democrat candidate for North Dorset, in the summer of 2005 and the couple had their first child John two years later.  The couple, who live in Surbiton, London, currently care for their disabled son with some help from external carers and Davey said that John will likely need full-time care for the rest of his life. Explaining that his wife takes on the majority of the care, he said: 'I like to be engaged because he's my lovely boy. So most of my caring is done in the morning or the weekends.'  When asked about his son's condition, he explained: 'We genuinely don't know....we felt when he was about four months and he wasn't developing well.  'We got to about nine months and we thought 'Something is wrong here'. He wasn't really sitting or engaging.  'They initially diagnosed him with cerebral palsy, but it wasn't cerebral palsy as it then transpired and Great Ormond Street Hospital were fantastic.'  Davey's experience as a carer drives much of his politics and he often campaigns for increased NHS investment and further government help for carers.  'I think caring roles should be valued far more', he said. 'Because I think they're quite tough actually. There's the emotional impact and then and actually caring is tough work, all hours it's not glamorous.' ",
  "b95502b538bdb4d9f1e415d76c1b381b7df39d184ef0d21d070e1590": "The sister of the hero PC blinded by fugitive gunman Raoul Moat today slammed ITV for not having the 'common decency' to let his family know they were making a TV drama out of the infamous gun siege. PC Rathband's sister Debbie Essery was stunned to learn the week-long stand of one of Britain's most-notorious killers was being filmed for a series called 'The Hunt For Raoul Moat'. Former bouncer Moat, 37, killed his ex-girlfriend Samantha Stobbart's new partner Chris Brown before shooting Samantha in the stomach in Birtley, Gateshead, shortly after his release from prison in July 2010. He then declared war on the police whilst on the run shooting PC David Rathband in the face whilst he was parked up in a patrol car on a roundabout in Newcastle. Blinded Rathband later tragically took his own life two years later. Moat shot himself dead after police closed in on him by a riverbank in Rothbury. Debbie, 59, a mother of two told MailOnline: 'The first I knew of the programme is when I read it in the news. It came as such a big shock my blood literally ran cold. 'No one from ITV consulted any of our family or that of Chris Brown to say they were filming the drama. It would have been common decency to tell us.  'Other broadcasters who have made programmes about the siege have always given us prior warning. 'We know we can't stop things like this but the families of all those involved should have been told. I had no clue.' It comes just days after the twin brother of Mr Rathband, who was shot and blinded by Raoul Moat, said he will not watch a new drama about the gunman. Darren Rathband, 54, said his family do not need any more reminders of what happened to his sibling 12 years ago. 'David loss gives us a painful reminder everyday. If it's based on facts and not fiction, the story remains the same,' he told ChroniceLive.  'I don't watch them, don't need to and never will. I sadly lived being involved in it.'  On announcing the drama ITV said: 'It will shine a light on the human tragedies that lay behind Britain's biggest manhunt, told through the eyes of those who sought to bring a violent killer to justice.' Debbie continued: 'I understand the nature of human inquisition but everybody knows what happened and those that don't can find out. We as a family went through the most horrific time so why make a tv show out of it. 'All it does is open old wounds and what for just to make ITV more millions. Please let my brother David and Chris Brown rest in peace and think of their families who still have to deal with the loss of their loved ones twelve years later. 'Even now I can't watch police documentaries and the sound of police sirens just set me off because not a day goes by without me thinking of the tragic events of that hot summer week and the aftermath of losing David.  'We lost our daughter so it is like a double loss for us after David took his own life. 'We now have a beautiful granddaughter as we didn't think we'd have another girl in the family so we have learned to cherish the happy moments in life. 'Now the news of this programme has cast a shadow over the whole family again.' Debbie from Newcastle added: 'Darren was a big part of him and he struggles daily to cope with his brother's loss even now.  'David and I were also extremely close so it is not just a TV programme but the implication of what it does to certain people. 'I am a realist. I can turn the tv off and manage my grief, my days, but other family members can't. Did ITV ever consider our feelings? No, not for one minute sadly.' Screenwriter Kevin Sampson who wrote the drama has defended the programme. He said: 'In 2022 violence against women remains rife and is all too often accompanied by a victim-blaming agenda. I hope this drama will go some way to condemning this narrative.' PC David Rathband hanged himself after he was blinded by Moat because he couldn't cope with his new disability and a breakdown in his marriage, a coroner ruled.  Mr Rathband was found at his home in Blyth, Northumberland, in February 2012, after he was shot in the face by crazed gunman Moat in July 2010. The officer had moved out of the marital home in August 2011 after his wife found out he was having an affair with 7/7 London bombing survivor Lisa French.  He became a national hero and used his profile to set up the Blue Lamp Foundation to support 999 staff injured at work. However, the inquest heard Mr Rathband, 44, had made threats to kill himself and told Miss French he had attempted to hang himself but could not go through with it. On the night Mr Rathband took his own life, his estranged wife Kath visited him for the last time. She said she thought he looked 'awful' and decided he needed support. But she felt she was not the right person to be with him and contacted his sister Debbie Essery and his welfare officer. Concluding that Rathband took his own life, Coroner Eric Armstrong said: 'The circumstances of his injuries [inflicted by Moat] are well known. It is difficult, if not impossible, not to view the infliction of those injuries as the first step in a series which culminated in his death. 'Many people may look back, police officers and others, and with the benefit of hindsight, form the view that they wish they could have done something else. Could I implore them not to carry that out? Decisions were taken which at the time seemed appropriate and were justified at the time.'   In a statement read after the hearing by lawyer Philip Davison, Kath thanked family and friends for their 'unwavering' support. She said: 'David fought so hard to come to terms with the devastating injuries that resulted from the shooting and the effect it had on us all as a family. 'Whilst I have lost David, he has left me with two amazing children and he would be immensely proud of them and what they have achieved, as I am.'  Moment Raoul Moat blasted himself in the head with sawn-off shotgun is recreated for ITV drama: Actor is filmed kneeling on the grass with weapon in scenes showing the killer's final hours before he took his own life  By Tom Pyman for MailOnline  The moment crazed gunman Raoul Moat blasted himself in the head with a sawn-off shotgun has been recreated for a new ITV drama. Actor Matt Stokoe, 33, was last night filmed kneeling on the grass with the weapon under his chin in chilling scenes showing the killer's final hours before he took his own life.  Stokoe was seen on his knees, holding a sawn off shotgun to his chin, while armed officers surrounded him, repeatedly asking him to drop his weapon.  The actor was then seen lifting the gun up to the side of his head and pulling the trigger before collapsing on the floor. The scenes, filmed after dark, were eerily similar to the real life ending of the huge manhunt for Moat in 2010.  Spurned former bouncer Moat, 37, had just been released from Durham Prison following an 18-week sentence for assault when he began his vindictive campaign of murder early on July 3 that year - first by killing ex-girlfriend Samantha Stobbart's karate instructor lover Chris Brown, then shooting her in the stomach through a house window in Birtley, Gateshead. He then declared war on police while on the run for murder and attempted murder, and blasted PC David Rathband in the face when he found the officer parked up in a patrol car on a roundabout in Newcastle. Rathband was blinded in the senseless attack and went on to take his own life in February 2012 because he couldn't cope with his disability, a coroner ruled. Moat took refuge with a pair of accomplices in Rothbury, Northumberland, but his actions triggered one of the nation's most notorious manhunts. Armed police were drafted in from around the country, survival expert Ray Mears was brought in to advise on where Moat could be fleeing, and RAF jets with heat-seeking cameras were deployed to canvas the north east of England in search for the killer. The thug was eventually cornered by armed police before a six-hour stand-off began - during which footballer Paul Gascoigne famously turned up at the site of the police stand-off with a fishing rod and chicken dinner to try and talk 'Moaty' round. As negotiators tried to get Moat to put down his weapon, the crazed killer shot himself in the head. Stokoe, famous for roles in the Channel 4 series Misfits, the BBC series Bodyguard and Sky's Jamestown, has assumed the lead role of Moat, while Sally Messham (Doc Martin) and Josef Davies (Chernobyl) will play Moat's ex-lover Stobbart and murder victim Brown. The drama will also star The A Word's Lee Ingleby as Northumbria Police Officer Neil Adamson, who was among the main police officers searching for Moat while he evaded capture.  Thursday, July 1, 2010: Released from Durham prison after serving a short time for assault Saturday, July 3, 2010: Moat shoots dead Chris Brown, who is the new partner of his ex girlfriend Samantha Stobbart, who he also tried to shoot twice through the window of a property Sunday, July 4, 2010: Moat shoots PC David Rathband and the public are urged not to approach him Monday, July 5, 2010: Cleveland, Humberside, West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire and Cumbria Police join up with Northumberland Police to help them with the search for Moat Tuesday, July 6, 2010: Moat declares war on the police. Police also investigate an armed robbery from the day before as the description matches Moat's Wednesday, July 7, 2010: Police offer PS10,000 reward for information leading to his capture Thursday, July 8, 2010: Police urge public to be vigilant as they release new images of Moat Friday, July 9, 2010: Moat located in Rothbury with witnesses saying he is on the floor with a gun to his head near the riverbank Saturday, July 10, 2010: Moat shoots himself after a six-hour stand off with police Sonya Cassidy (The Last Kingdom) and Vineeta Rishi (Holby City) have also been announced as cast members. It is not clear if Gascoigne will feature in the show.  The series has been titled 'The Hunt for Raoul Moat', though a release date is yet to be confirmed.  Born in 1973, Moat was bought up by his grandmother in Newcastle's deprived West End - just a few doors down from his parents, Josephine and stepfather Brian Healey. Moat was widely regarded as a man with an explosive temper; a muscle-bound bodybuilder addicted to steroids and anti-depressants who could flip at a moment's notice.  Samantha told Newcastle Crown Court in 2011 after the shooting spree that Moat had a 'Jekyll and Hyde split personality', and was prone towards violent behaviour. At the time of his death Moat had been on the run for a week after being released from Durham prison following an 18-week sentence for assault. Just two days after his release the 37-year-old shot dead Chris Brown and wounded his ex-girlfriend Samantha Stobbart on July 3.  Just hours later he left PC David Rathband blind, he took his own life two years later. Just days before the stand off with police, officers released new images of Moat and urged the public to stay away from him. Pictures were also released by police showing the equipment Moat was using to hide in his woodland lair. On Friday 9 July officers located three of Moat's mobile phones. One, used to make the two 999 calls to police before and after PC David Rathband was shot. Moat was later cornered into a riverbank and had a shot gun to his head. Moat's friend Tony Laidler was escorted into the police cordon and food and water items were also bought in as the stand off continued. Moat's ex-girlfriend Samantha Stobbart told a court in 2011 that the crazed gunman 'had a Jekyll and Hyde split personality' as she told of the horrifying moment the killer attacked her and her lover.  Moat had just shot her karate instructor boyfriend Chris Brown in the neck and chest before 'calmly executing' him with a final shot to the head, a trial heard. Miss Stobbart wept as she told a jury at Newcastle Crown Court how Moat 'just appeared' and started shooting on July 3 last year.  She said the killer had a 'Jekyll and Hyde split personality' and could be violent and unpredictable.  Miss Stobbart said: 'Chris went down to the grass and I followed him. I remember Raoul was shouting. I don't know what. Shouting. He pointed the gun at my legs and I ran into the house.  'I could not see anybody. I was panicking because my daughter was upstairs and I was running about the house looking for the keys and I did not know what they looked like. 'I heard two shots. When I looked out the window it was done. I didn't see Raoul come towards the house, I was concentrating on Chris. I just heard shouting and before I knew it I got shot.'  In the early hours of Saturday morning a gunshot was heard, Moat shot himself and no shots were fired by police. He was taken to hospital for treatment but died just hours later. In a bizarre twist to the police stand-off with the killer in Rothbury, which was widely reported at the time, former England footballer Paul Gascoigne showed up to try to talk Moat down. Speaking in the years following the manhunt, Gascoigne told the Mirror: 'I thought that I could take Raoul Moat fishing because he was near a river. I told the taxi driver 'head for the airport' and then when we got to Newcastle airport I said 'head for Rothbury'. 'The taxi driver said 'you are not going where I think you are going?' And I said 'yes I am'.' He said he went on to tell the taxi driver that he could 'save Moat' because he had been through so much himself during his struggles with addiction and alcoholism.  When Gascoigne got out of the taxi he said he headed straight for the field where Moat was surrounded by police. He asked police 'where's Moaty', and one officer asked if he knew him personally, to which Gascoigne denied. He said rumours then started to circulate as to how he knew Moat with some saying they had been friends. They had never met, but as the situation around Moat intensified, Gascoigne found himself on TV screens and linked with the chain of events ever since. In the years since, several members of Moat's family have expressed the pain they still feel as a result of their son's actions and the abuse they are subject to. Moat's ex-girlfriend Samantha was rushed to Queen Elizabeth hospital in Gateshead, where she was left fighting for her life, after she was shot. On July 5, Samantha was declared to no longer be in a critical condition following the attack, and left hospital on July 17.  That same day she issued a direct appeal to Moat, who had gone on the run, and said: 'Please give yourself up. If you still loved me and our baby you would not be doing this.' Miss Stobbart told a court in 2011 that the crazed gunman 'had a Jekyll and Hyde split personality' as she told of the horrifying moment the killer attacked her and her lover.  Moat had just shot her karate instructor boyfriend Chris Brown in the neck and chest before 'calmly executing' him with a final shot to the head, a trial heard. Miss Stobbart wept as she told a jury at Newcastle Crown Court how Moat 'just appeared' and started shooting on July 3 last year. 'Chris went down to the grass and I followed him. I remember Raoul was shouting. I don't know what. Shouting. He pointed the gun at my legs and I ran into the house,' she said.  'I could not see anybody.

  "89515f3081e460c3a6f08f14d0f3de714499acf8e05740f1282d0fc9": "A smiling Queen stood unaided today as she held a face-to-face audience with the president of Switzerland at Windsor Castle. The monarch, who returned from a week-long break at her Sandringham estate yesterday, smiled broadly as she posed for photographs with Ignazio Cassis and his wife Paola in her Oak Room sitting room this morning. The Queen stood without her walking stick and was dressed in a blue and grey paisley-style patterned silk dress. She was wearing her fruit-themed sapphire and diamond grapes brooch, which features a sapphire bow and 16 small diamonds shaped like a bunch of grapes. It was inherited from the Queen Mother.  She flew back to her Berkshire castle in a Sikorsky S-76C helicopter with The Queen's Helicopter Flight team from the Royal Household, after spending time away at her Norfolk retreat where she celebrated turning 96 last Thursday. Yesterday, the Queen was photographed being driven away from Wood Farm - a cottage nestled in the far reaches of the country estate - in a Range Rover at around 11.30am before getting into the helicopter. She was spotted in the back seat of the car as she was chauffeur-driven away from the five-bedroom farmhouse which was the home in retirement of her late husband Prince Philip, who died in April last year.  The Queen has told how the Duke of Edinburgh 'loved' the cottage and part of its attraction was because the 'sea was so close'. The monarch arrived in Sandringham last week to spend her 96th birthday privately, and over the last few days she has been seen visiting her stables on the estate with her racing manager John Warren.  There were no public engagements for her birthday, but there will be celebrations for her official birthday and Platinum Jubilee in June. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said she is hoping to attend the State Opening of Parliament in less than two weeks' time, on May 10, but confirmation is expected closer to the time or on the day. The Queen, who has experienced mobility issues in recent months, has opened Parliament on all but two occasions during her reign. The exceptions were in 1959 and 1963, when she was pregnant with Prince Andrew and then Prince Edward, when her speech was read by the Lord Chancellor. In just over a month's time, the Platinum Jubilee bank holiday weekend will get under way, celebrating the nation's longest reigning head of state's 70 years on the throne. Festivities include Trooping the Colour, beacon lighting, a service of thanksgiving, the Epsom Derby, a pop concert at Buckingham Palace, and a spectacular Jubilee Pageant on the streets of London. It has not yet been confirmed how many of the high-profile events the Queen will be able to attend. On Wednesday evening, her second son, the disgraced Duke of York, was stripped of his Freedom of York by councillors in the city, amid further calls for him to have his dukedom removed.  It comes amid reports that the Queen may travel to Trooping the Colour by Range Rover instead of a royal carriage for the first time in her 70-year reign to boost her comfort after suffering from mobility issues. The monarch may make the journey from Buckingham Palace to Horse Guards Parade by 4x4 as part of several contingency plans being drawn up by officials ahead of the Platinum Jubilee weekend. During her reign, the Queen's attendance at most engagements has been planned for months and often announced publicly weeks in advance. But the presence of the monarch will now be a bonus, rather than guaranteed and 'will be decided on the day' due to mobility issues. Buckingham Palace distanced itself from the suggestion that the Queen would watch Trooping the Colour from the Major-General's office overlooking the parade ground rather than inspecting the troops on a dais, The Telegraph reported. A royal insider said: 'I cannot imagine in 100 years that if attending, Her Majesty wouldn't be seated on a dais in Horse Guards Parade. 'All the plans are fluid at the moment and nothing has been finalised.' The Queen's most recent public appearance came on March 29 at the thanksgiving service for her late husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, at Westminster Abbey. But over the past six months she has withdrawn from several other events historically central to her diary, including the Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph and the annual Commonwealth Service. Aides are hopeful the Queen will be able to attend some of the events organised to mark her 70th jubilee in person, although it is expected these will be few in number. The Household Cavalry is said to have been informed of alternative options in light of her mobility problems. The 4x4 proposal would see four mounted divisions escort the Queen's vehicle up The Mall on June 2, with other Royals sticking to the tradition of travelling by carriage. Prince Charles, Prince William and Princess Anne are expected to take part in the parade on horsebacks as part of their roles as 'Royal Colonels'. Another royal source told the Telegraph that the reason for the plan was 'both speed and comfort' as it is no longer comfortable for the Queen to 'travel by carriage or to be standing on a dais for an extended period'. Typically, the Queen is joined by her children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, as well as more distant relatives like her niece, nephew and cousins. She has extended the invitation to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who she saw together for the first time in more than two years when they stopped off at Windsor Castle last week on their way to the Netherlands for the Invictus Games. Harry, 37, and Meghan, 40, would attend in an informal role, following their decision to step down as working members of the Royal Family. Buckingham Palace is said to have promised the Sussexes full armed security at all Royal Family events in June in a bid to reassure them after Harry said he felt 'unsafe' in Britain.",
  "a85277f84ecd0c6f6f667b2a3c50b53dd07096228f476c29605ef520": "A frail and elderly mother was left screaming in pain as she waited 10 hours for an ambulance as the appalling wait times for emergency care continue to be laid bare. Stuart Donald was alerted by his mother's care provider at North Lincolnshire Council that she had pushed the emergency button on her lifeline alarm that she wears around her neck after being unable to get out of bed. The care provider contacted Mr Donald at 7am that morning, who told carers his 'frail' mother required an ambulance.  He dialled 111, who told him his mother required emergency care. Two hours later, Mr Donald was contacted by the East Midlands Ambulance service who promised to send an ambulance 'within six hours'. His elderly mother's realised she couldn't put any pressure on her legs without experiencing severe pain, but without the prospect of any medical assistance arriving her son drove 20 miles to go and help her. Arriving at her Scunthorpe home, Mr Donald called for a family member to help him move his mother, but they failed so he again called for an ambulance six hours later. 'I said: 'My mother is sat in absolute agony and we physically can't move her, we need help - you must have capacity', and he said, 'No, not at the moment, but as soon as someone becomes available we'll send someone'.  After upgrading the incident to a 'Category Two' response six hours later, medics should have arrived at the property within 18 minutes.  Despite this, it took the ambulance service 10 hours to finally arrive. They have since apologised for the incident and explained they must 'prioritise the sickest and most severely injured patients first'. Mr Donald slammed the service for 'failing to protect the public' after his mother's ordeal. After first realising she was unable to get out of bed without screaming in pain, Mr Donald's mother pushed her alarm button at 7am on Sunday, April 24. North Lincolnshire Council, her care provider, initially contacted Mr Donald's brother, who was in intensive care, but reached him who told them his mother required an ambulance. After trying to move her himself, he explained: 'She said she couldn't stand up and that she'd been stuck there and she daren't move sideways because she couldn't put weight on her legs, and she was scared she'd fall off the bed. 'I couldn't move her so I rang another family member to help move her, but we couldn't.  'We tried to lift her up and she just screamed in pain. We knew then it was an emergency because we had a frail old lady who had been sat on the edge of the bed for six hours, shaking and shivering.  'It was awful. I rang back and spoke to a very professional lady who said they recognised they hadn't got to my mum but that it had been upgraded to a Category Two incident'. According to the East Midlands Ambulance Service website, Category two incidents are classed as an emergency and should be responded to within 18 minutes  Elsewhere, patients have shared their stories of agonising waits for ambulances as NHS England last month admitted it is struggling to cope with a surge in demand and high staff absence rates. It comes as dozens of others across the country have reported 'horrendous' waiting times, with the Liberal Democrats describing the ambulance services as being at 'breaking point'.  The ambulance crew eventually arrived at 7.10pm - around ten hours after Mr Donald first called the ambulance for his mother. He said: 'They were brilliant with my mum, I can't fault them at all.  'They did checks and said she needed to go to hospital because she's clearly not right, and she needed hospital care. They took her in an ambulance at about 7.50pm. 'But they're playing a gambling game.  'There cannot be adequate cover if it takes nine-plus hours for an emergency response. What would have happened if my mum had deteriorated? 'She was screaming in pain and I was crying because I couldn't lift her. I was so frustrated because I just didn't know what else I could do.'   Sue Cousland, Divisional Director for Lincolnshire at East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) said: 'We are really sorry that we were not able to get to her sooner and this is not the level of service we aim to provide for our patients. 'Unfortunately, we continue to experience a sustained level of life-threatening and serious emergency calls and we continually work to prioritise the sickest and most severely injured patients first. 'We are working very closely with all of our health and social care partners to improve the response to patients in Lincolnshire.' More than a quarter of patients arriving by ambulance at hospitals in England in March waited at least 30 minutes to be handed over to A&E departments - the highest level since the start of winter, new figures show. Some 21,051 delays of half an hour or longer were recorded across all hospital trusts in the seven days to March 27. This was 26% of the 79,588 arrivals by ambulance. The proportion of handovers delayed by at least 30 minutes has been rising in recent weeks, having stood at 20% in mid-February. Figures for ambulance delays are published by NHS England and the current data runs from the start of December 2021. There were 9,225 arrivals last week - 12% of the total - who were kept waiting more than an hour to be handed to A&E teams, up from 10% in the previous week. Analysis of the data shows that Northern Lincolnshire & Goole NHS Foundation Trust reported the highest proportion of handovers delayed by at least 30 minutes last month (74%), followed by Gloucestershire Hospitals (71%), University Hospitals Plymouth (71%) and University Hospitals Bristol & Weston (68%). University Hospitals Plymouth topped the list for handovers delayed by more than an hour (58%), followed by Northern Lincolnshire & Goole (57%), Gloucestershire Hospitals (54%) and University Hospitals Bristol & Weston (52%). A handover delay does not always mean a patient has waited in the ambulance. They may have been moved into an A&E department but staff were not available to complete the handover. The figures are another sign of the pressures hospitals are facing amid the latest rise in coronavirus infections. Separate data published on Thursday showed staff absences at NHS hospitals in England due to Covid-19 have jumped to their highest level since the end of January, with numbers climbing in all regions. Absences averaged 27,571 a day last week - the equivalent of 3% of the workforce - up from 23,127 the previous week, though still some way below the 45,736 (5% of the workforce) reached in early January. Responding to the figures, NHS national medical director Professor Stephen Powis said: 'NHS staff remain under pressure as they deal with high numbers of patients in hospital alongside a spike in staff absences due to Covid-19 - with numbers of staff off sick due to Covid almost doubling in the last three weeks. 'Yet NHS staff are working hard to deliver as much routine care as possible, as well as rolling out the NHS spring booster programme, so if you have a health concern, please come forward for the care you need.' A total of 15,632 people were in hospital in England with Covid-19 as of March 30, up 18% week on week and the highest since January 19, NHS England said. Patient numbers are nearing the peak reached in early January - 17,120 - but remain well below the 34,336 at the peak of the second wave of the virus at the start of 2021.",
  "a5c56775c1f0833ece6de3a0e167bdc7d7f68a1fe4b5e49e0f3ff3f8": "The Queen will 'certainly not' take Prince Andrew's Duke of York title off him - after councillors in the city voted to strip him of the honour. Her Majesty, 96, will not remove the title that she gave him over 30 years ago in 1986, Royal sources have claimed. It came after councillors have voted to strip the Duke of York of his freedom of that city and called for him to have his dukedom removed.  The prince was branded 'an utter disgrace' during the extraordinary meeting to debate his Freedom of the City honour, which was awarded to him in 1987. After discussing the motion for around half an hour, councillors unanimously voted to strip him of the title. His continued clinging to the title Duke of York was described as as 'stain' on the city and councillors are now calling on the Queen, Palace or government to step in and strip him of the title if he refuses 'to do the right thing' and resign. The council also noted objections from the public calling for the prince be banned from attending horse racing events in the city. Another said he should be referred to as 'Andrew Windsor' in the future.  A source told the Mirror: 'The Queen certainly will not take any further action in that regard. 'The Duke of York has stepped back from public life and already had a range of titles and associations removed and Her Majesty's position has not deviated from that.' Andrew had been warned in advance that he would be losing the freedom of the city, an honour bestowed on him on February 23, 1987, as a wedding gift to Sarah Ferguson. He is the first person ever to have the Freedom of the City removed, councillors were told. There were two formal abstentions - from the Lord Mayor and Lord Mayor elect. Lib Dem Darryl Smalley, City of York Council's executive member for culture, leisure & communities proposed the motion and says he should also now lose the Duke of York title. He said last night: 'The Honorary Freedom of York is the highest honour we, as a city, can bestow on those who represent the very best of York. The honour is held by many notable and accomplished people who carry it with pride and responsibly. 'Having been stripped of his military roles and royal patronages by the Queen, we believe that it is right to remove all links that Prince Andrew still has with our great city. 'I was pleased to see councillors of all parties support this motion and make it clear that it is no longer appropriate for Prince Andrew to represent York and its residents. 'The removal of this honorary title sends the right message that we as a city stand with victims of abuse. The next logical step is now for Prince Andrew to do the right thing and relinquish his Duke of York title. 'If he fails to do so, the Government and Buckingham Palace must step in to remove his title to finally end Prince Andrew's connection to York.' It follows a slew of authorities, institutions, schools and even golf clubs, which have all sought to distance themselves from the disgraced duke since he settled his civil case with Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking victim Virginia Giuffre.  In the wake of the case, which was settled in February, the 62-year-old was also stripped of his military roles and royal patronages and was told he would no longer be known as 'His Royal Highness'.  Both Buckingham Palace and a spokesperson for the Duke of York declined to comment. York City Council considered the motion: 'The Council resolves that, pursuant to Section 249 of the Local Government Act 1972, the City of York Council withdraws the Honorary Freeman of the City status from the Duke of York which was conferred upon him in 1987.'  The meeting at York Race Course started with an impassioned plea from York resident Gwen Swinburn, who is well known for her clashes with the council. She said: 'This motion could not have been any weaker. Mr Andrew Windsor is an utter disgrace. He brings shame and reputational damage everywhere he goes including to our city. 'The motion to withdraw his status goes nowhere near far enough. He needs to be declared persona non grata in York.' 'As we all know, he loves his horse racing so please agree to write to the race course asking he never be invited here,' she continued. 'That man casts a long shadow and our Queen has removed almost all titles and a responsibilities except his dukedom which stains this city. We need to do more than the easy bit, which is to remove his freedom.' Councillor Aisling Musson, for York Labour Group, added: 'This title damages the reputation of our city. We owe it to the people of York, in particular those affected by sexual violence, abuse or human trafficking. 'Our first duty is not to our reputation but their well-being and protection and remove this stain of association on our city which I am sure has weighed heavily on their minds - and may even have brought up pain and trauma they have worked hard to move past from.' Councillor Mark Warters added: 'While it is purely a symbolic act it does send a very strong signal from this city.' Councillor Martin Rolley, for the Tory Group, is also calling for a new watchdog awards sub committee to be set up to vet future suggestions for Freeman. York has a long history of freemen dating back to 1272. Freemen can claim their rights through patronage as far back as their great-great-grandparent. Once they are sworn in, freemen can join the Gild of Freemen who take an interest in the affairs of the city. New admissions are made every year. Back then, freemen were given control of city trade, city strays and rights of pasture. They were also given roles in running the city.  However, in modern times, they have no privileges in the city. You can still claim Freemanship through 'hereditary right' but it is also now possible to just apply for the tile by filling out an application form.   He added: 'I would like to challenge the council. The title dates back many many years. 'We want to ensure nobody receives a freedom of the city award as a result of a right of birth or standing in their community other than earned in the community.' Councillor Dave Taylor added: 'The motion has been very carefully worded to avoid any lurid allegations which would be difficult if not impossible to substantiate. 'However, I subscribe to the point of view that the Duke of York has shown a dreadful lack of judgment in his friendships with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. 'I hope in the future the Monarch might appoint the Princess Beatrice to be Duchess of York. In contrast to his father, she is personable, intelligent and does her homework and reads her briefing paper when visiting the city of York.' Councillor Denise Craghill, for the Green Group, said: 'It is highly inappropriate Andrew should retain the freedom of the city. 'It is highly inconsistent what we stand for as a city and would like the Palace and Government to take action to remove his title as Duke of York.' The Duke is the first VIP to be stripped of his Freeman status since Jimmy Savile, who had his taken by Scarborough Council in 2011.  The meeting in York had been scheduled to take place virtually last month but the plug was pulled just two hours before it was due to start following objections from Labour councillors.  The decision to cancel the initial meeting caused fury among councillors, but York Council's Lib Dem Group said the vote would go ahead on the same motion in April.  The spokesman said: 'The votes taken remotely would have been seen as recommendations and would have had to go to the Chief Operating Officer to be confirmed as decisions. 'Virtual meetings took place during Covid when the COO agreed with all the recommendations. It is purely because the agenda item on this meeting was very, very political. 'It was felt it would be better to hold it safely and properly in person once members were ready and healthy enough to attend. 'Quite a few councillors had recently tested positive for Covid and the real concern was many of them were vulnerable.'  Ahead of the cancelled meeting last month, Darryl Smalley, a Liberal Democrat councillor for York City, told the Independent: 'York's unique connection to the crown and the monarch is an important part of our city's legacy and history.   'However, as a council and city, we stand with victims of sexual abuse and are doing all we can to end violence against women and girls locally.  'As such, it is inappropriate that Prince Andrew retains his ambassadorial title that is intrinsically linked to our city.'  Mr Smalley had previously called on Prince Andrew to be stripped of his title. A survey by York's daily newspaper The Press found that 88 per cent of its readers want to see the prince's Duke of York honours taken away from him.   Phil Pinder, a retailer in the famous cathedral city told The York Press in February: 'York deserves better. He has been stripped of his royal duties; he has done a settlement out of court ending the prospect of any kind of legal clearing of his name so the only option is for him to permanently step down as the Duke of York as well. 'York deserves another royal to represent it instead.' He suggested the 'controversial' choice of Prince Harry, who lives in the US and holds the Duke of Sussex title.  There are also multiple petitions to remove the Duke of York honour from Prince Andrew.  One with 1,500 signatories says: 'Not only has 'Prince' Andrew demonstrated a lack of morals, lack of humanity and lack of judgement by protracted fraternising with Jeffrey Epstein, his recent interview confirms he lacks the ability to reflect, show insight and learn.  'Most importantly, it reveals a total lack of caring for others. 'These are not Yorkshire values. Having him associated with such a proud, fair and straight talking county is contradictory and embarrassing. Remove the title.'  Prince Andrew made his first public appearance since he withdrew from public life following his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was found guilty in 2021 of child sex trafficking, at the service for his father Prince Philip. The shamed royal insisted on accompanying the Queen from Windsor Castle to the thanksgiving event at Westminster Abbey. But to the shock of many in the congregation he then escorted his mother all the way to her front-row position - in full view of the live broadcast cameras. It had been expected that the Dean of Westminster would take the Queen to her seat, with Andrew behind. It was claimed the Queen 'personally paid PS2m to Virginia Roberts's charity' as part of Andrew's PS12m settlement. 'Stipulation of Dismissal' documents were filed with a court on March 8, with lawyers on both sides calling for the legal action to be dismissed, indicating the settlement has been paid. As the order was published, the Treasury confirmed no taxpayer funds were used for either the payment to Virginia Roberts or for the Duke of York's legal fees. A freedom of information request asked whether any money from the Sovereign Grant to the Royal Family or any other government money was used. The Treasury insisted: 'No public money has been used to pay legal or settlement fees.' The joint order filed with the New York court said each party would pay their own costs and fees.  There were reports the Queen or even Prince Charles contributed to the settlement by paying it or loaning him the money until the sale goes through of a PS17million Swiss ski chalet he owns with ex-wife, Sarah, Duchess of York. Mrs Roberts had sued Andrew for alleged sexual abuse. She claimed he had sex with her when she was 17 after he was trafficked by his friend, the late billionaire paedophile Epstein. The duke will make a 'substantial donation' to a charity for sex abuse victims set up by Mrs Roberts, now a 38-year-old mother-of-three. He said he now regrets his association with Epstein. Andrew, who was forced to step down from royal duties and public life as a result of the scandal, previously claimed he had no recollection of meeting Mrs Roberts and has always strongly denied her allegations. He agreed to the settlement in February.   A slew of authorities, institutions, schools and even golf clubs, have all sought to distance themselves from the disgraced duke since he settled his civil case with Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking victim Virginia Roberts.  In the wake of the case, which was settled in February, the 62-year-old was also stripped of his military roles and royal patronages and was told he would no longer be known as 'His Royal Highness'.

  "6c84b80421107e56cd53c1a52f623f6e08b61826571e0ba1b918ec66": "Premier League striker Callum Wilson was fined after parking his Lamborghini illegally on double yellow lines so he could shop. The Newcastle United and former England hotshot's PS230,000 supercar was spotted by traffic wardens on a double yellow line. The 30-year-old striker had left his flash Urus motor on double yellow lines in the upmarket Jesmond suburb of the city. The parking warden was seen looking at the registration of the sporty SUV - which has a 0-60 of 3.6 seconds. He then issued a ticket and put it on the windscreen of Wilson's 190mph car. The forward - out with a calf injury since December - had left his motor near shops and cafes just a mile from St James' Park. The warden gave him the ticket at 2:40pm last Tuesday afternoon. It's believed the ticket would cost upto PS70 with a discount if paid within a fortnight. An onlooker said: 'I was just walking down Acorn Road in Jesmond, near Newcastle and I saw the traffic warden looking at the car. 'I instantly knew this was Callum Wilson's car as it's very distinctive and I have seen him in this car a number of times. 'I just observed the warden giving the car the ticket. And Wilson didn't come back for at least 20 minutes when I was there. It's not like he was dashing into a shop for 30 seconds - he left his car on a double yellow line where there are regular wardens. Wilson signed for the Magpies in December 2020 for a fee of PS20million from Bournemouth. He has been capped four times by the Three Lions scoring one goal. Newcastle United has been approached for comment.",
  "78670a68e67c88710f1e25fa3dcc8a9dc3bc5e268d6d70b88fb56b6c": "A Samsung advert featuring a woman jogging alone at night in London, with headphones on, has been branded 'tone deaf' by viewers. Critics - who claim 'women wouldn't feel safe doing that' - said the one-minute ad plugging the Galaxy Watch 4, Galaxy Buds 2 and the Galaxy SS2 phone was 'naive' and 'insulting'. The commercial - called Night Owls - sees a sporty woman checking her watch at 2am, before putting in earbuds and heading out into the dark for a night-time jog in the British capital.  Some people on Twitter felt that the advert was unrealistic, claiming women would never feel safe enough to go job by themselves at all hours of the night, with earbuds on.   In a statement, Samsung told Femail the campaign aimed to celebrate individuality and that it was never meant to be insensitive to 'ongoing conversations around women's safety.'  In the advert, the woman wakes up at 2am, and decides to go for a job around the streets of London.   She can be seen running down a dark, empty, street as a large owl watches over her, before passing a skateboarder, some clubbers, a ballerina, a security guard, a construction worker and a hoard of other night-time runners. She then chats with a man on a bike on a deserted bridge. Throughout the jog she checks her progress with a Samsung smartwatch as a voiceover says: 'Sleep at night. Run faster. Push harder.  'Follow the herd. Not for me. I run on a different schedule: mine.'  But customers suggested how unrealistic and dangerous it would be for a woman to go running through a city at night, wearing earphones. 'Every time it comes on, I find myself saying 'No woman would ever do that',' one said. 'She definitely wouldn't be smiling about it, or smiling at random strangers on her own, in the dark,' they added. 'The writers of that ad have clearly never even met a woman.' 'My daughter's first comment 'Can't you just tell a man came up with this advert',' another wrote.  'I'm so staggered by it. It's just so tone deaf, especially with everything that's happened lately,' one said.  'Don't get me wrong, I'd love to live in a world where a woman can go running at 2am. But we ain't there,' one regretted.  'What's she doing engaging with the cyclist on a deserted bridge in the middle of the night? So many issues with this advert,' another said. Someone else wrote: 'With everything that has happened with regards to women's safety - I feel this advert is in poor taste.' And one man - called George - wrote: 'I'm a 6'6 18 stone man living in a relatively safe area and I wouldn't bloody run at 2am with headphones in.' It comes after the Government plugged PS5million into protecting women's safety at night last year amid a terrifying spate of drink spiking incidents and the harrowing murders of Sarah Everard and Sabina Nessa. Both young women were attacked and murdered while walking alone at night.  And recent data shows four out of five women felt unsafe walking alone after dark in a park or other open space, while one in two women felt unsafe walking alone after dark in a quiet street near their home. In a statement, Samsung told Femail: 'The 'Night Owls' campaign was designed with a positive message in mind: to celebrate individuality and freedom to exercise at all hours. 'It was never our intention to be insensitive to ongoing conversations around women's safety.  'As a global company with a diverse workforce, we apologise for how this may have been received,' it went on. ",
  "e12c9a0642292ec0b3fd3d350a00f0f22e2208cab59101ce0a22cccd": "Boris Johnson slapped down the Commons Speaker yesterday over his extraordinary bid to summon the editor of The Mail on Sunday for a lecture. Downing Street issued a thinly veiled rebuke to Sir Lindsay Hoyle after he demanded that David Dillon attend a meeting in Parliament to explain a controversial article about Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner. Mr Dillon turned down the meeting, saying that while he had the 'greatest possible respect' for Parliament, Britain's free Press would not endure 'if journalists have to take instruction from officials of the House of Commons, however august they may be'. Sir Lindsay appeared to be in retreat on the issue last night, with aides saying he had no intention of saying more on the matter. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said that Mr Johnson was 'uncomfortable' with the idea of politicians summoning journalists to explain their stories. He said the PM would not want 'any perception of politicians seeking to in any way curb or control what a free Press seeks to report'. He added: 'We have a free Press in this country and reporters must be free to report what they are told as they see fit.' Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab backed Mr Dillon's decision to boycott the meeting. Mr Raab said it was 'legitimate' for the Speaker to take an interest in coverage of MPs but added: 'It's the prerogative of any editor to decide how they treat that invitation.' Sir Iain Duncan Smith also questioned the Speaker's conduct, saying that Parliament 'should not interfere' with the contents of newspapers. The former Conservative leader told the Daily Mail: 'I'm not sure what on earth the Speaker thought he was going to achieve and I am glad he's seen sense. As a general rule Parliament should not interfere in editorial matters.' A former minister added: 'It's just insane. The Speaker... shouldn't be policing accuracy or offensive opinions. 'It's bonkers - what the hell is he thinking? I haven't found anyone who thinks he has handled this well.' The row began when The Mail on Sunday reported that a Tory MP had heard Mrs Rayner telling a group of around eight MPs on the Commons terrace that she liked to put the Prime Minister 'off his stride' by crossing and uncrossing her legs while sitting opposite him in the Commons. Labour's deputy leader categorically denied the claims, which she described as 'desperate, perverted smears'. But since then, three further MPs - including a woman - have come forward to say that they were present on the terrace and that they heard Mrs Rayner herself joke about her 'tactic'. In total, four MPs have all given the same account of what she said, including the use of a startling slang colloquialism. The Daily Mail also revealed yesterday that Mrs Rayner laughed and joked about a comparison to Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct at a comedy event earlier this year. In a light-hearted interview with comedian Matt Forde in January, she volunteered the fact that an appearance at Prime Minister's Questions had drawn such comparisons, joking that it had sparked an internet meme of her crossing and uncrossing her legs. She told his Political Party podcast: 'I wasn't aware I did it but apparently there was this whole meme about how my dress was a bit revealing, but I didn't think it was.' Mr Forde asked if the suggestion was that she was trying to distract the Prime Minister. Mrs Rayner, who said she had been 'mortified' by the meme, laughed and replied: 'It don't take much does it? I don't need to do that.' Mrs Rayner yesterday insisted that the fact she had tried to 'brush aside' the sexism she faces 'doesn't make it OK'. She rejected the idea that she 'enjoys being subjected to sexist slurs', adding: 'I don't. They are mortifying and deeply hurtful.' In a letter to the Speaker on Tuesday night, Mr Dillon said he and The Mail on Sunday's political editor would no longer be attending the meeting with him after he had 'regrettably' commented on the story in public. In a statement on Monday, Sir Lindsay told MPs that he 'shares the views' of many MPs that the story about Mrs Rayner was 'misogynistic and offensive'. Mr Dillon said he had judged the article 'without being in possession of the facts surrounding how it came to be reported'. A spokesman for Sir Lindsay said yesterday that he would not be making any comment on The Mail on Sunday's response. In a statement on Tuesday, he insisted he was a 'staunch believer and protector of Press freedom', saying he had refused a request from a Labour MP last week to ban The Times's sketch writer for making allegedly 'sexist' observations. He added: 'I firmly believe in the duty of reporters to cover Parliament, but I would also make a plea - nothing more - for the feelings of all MPs and their families to be considered, and the impact on their safety, when articles are written. 'I would just ask that we are all a little kinder. That is what I wanted to talk about.'",
  "0fba33e688f73d4aa3af86310a48095ade08adf650ad343d634a3587": "Boris Johnson has summoned Passport Office bosses to Downing Street to explain the renewal chaos which has seen 700,000 outstanding applications still to clear amid fears over a summer of cancelled holidays. The Prime Minister is said to be 'horrified' at the backlog - but the Home Office insisted today that the agency's PS160,000-a-year director-general working from home at her village property in Leicestershire, 100 miles away from its London headquarters, has 'precisely zero bearing on the current situation with passports'. Abi Tierney, 48, who was appointed as director-general in early 2020 when the pandemic began and lives with her two young sons, is battling to control the chaos as customer services teams continue to work from home. Home Office sources said Dr Tierney, who is responsible for leading 3,500 Passport Office staff, spends most of her time working at its centres around Britain - including in London, where the headquarters is located in Victoria. And Home Office Permanent Secretary Matthew Rycroft said claims that she is under pressure to return to HQ full-time 'totally ignores reality'. He praised her for being 'a hugely talented leader', adding: 'With sites spread across the UK, Abi works day-in, day-out with teams around the country delivering vital services for the British public.'  However the Daily Telegraph claimed today that a resident of the Leicestershire village where Dr Tierney lives said she appeared to be based there, 107 miles from London. Conservative former minister David Jones told MailOnline today that the claim 'underlines the importance of civil servants getting back to the office environment', adding: 'It beggars belief that any senior official would be staying at home when her office is so clearly in crisis.' And Tory MP Henry Smith told MailOnline that there had been 'notable deterioration in services' among government agencies, such as the Passport Office, as officials were slow to return to their offices.  But the Home Office defended Dr Tierney and told MailOnline that it has Passport Offices 'in a range of locations across the UK, with 90 per cent of our staff based outside London', adding: 'It is therefore ludicrous to suggest that any senior leader not living there would impact on their ability to do their job to the highest standards.'  Britons trying to get their passport renewed are furious at being left on hold for hours before being told by customer services staff working from home that they cannot access files to provide an update on applications.  Among them is Mohammad Reza, a dual British-Iranian national, who told the newspaper while queuing at the Passport Office for his son's documents: 'I got through to the customer service after four hours on hold.  'One of them told me they all work from home. That's the reason why customer services have no access to the files. That's the reason why they can't give proper updates. It's shocking. Why are they still at home?' It comes after Mr Johnson delivered an ultimatum to stay-at-home officials as he threatened to 'privatise the a***' off the Passport Office and DVLA amid huge backlogs. The Prime Minister said families deserve better than the 'post-Covid manana culture' that has seen thousands of civil servants refusing to return to the office. Also in recent days, Brexit Opportunities Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg warned civil servants who refuse to return to Whitehall risk losing their plum London jobs. The Conservative MP has been leaving notes on the desks of absent civil servants which read 'sorry you were out when I visited. I look forward to seeing you in the office very soon'. Mr Johnson will summon Dr Tierney for urgent talks at Downing Street next week as the Passport Office struggles to cope with high demand after five million people did not renew their travel documents during the pandemic. Downing Street chief of staff Steve Barclay is expected to meet with Passport Office officials later this week. Dr Tierney lives in a village just over 100 miles away from the London office, which takes about two-and-a-half hours to drive. Direct non-stop trains from Leicester railway station take about one hour to London St Pancras.  The Passport Office is set to deal with 9.5 million applications this year - up from four million applications in 2020 and five million in 2021 when Covid-19 restrictions were in place. Holidaymakers in Britain are now being advised to leave at least ten weeks to get a new passport, but MPs have said this target is being regularly breached.  The Telegraph - which first reported the claims in today's newspaper - also revealed that 300,000 applications are being held up by delays in uploading documents, while a further 400,000 are currently being processed. On Monday, the Commons heard about one woman who had waited more than five months to receive her daughter's new passport, with services branded 'either really very good or an absolute shambles'.  The French-owned company contracted to run the Passport Office's contact centre has been ordered to hire more people to ease 'unacceptable' delays. Teleperformance, the private firm responsible for the office's call handling, has been 'urgently tasked to add additional staff' by the Home Office. The head of the Passport Office, Abi Tierney, will discuss Teleperformance's problems with its chief executive this week, according to The Times.  The company has been heavily criticised by exasperated applicants in recent weeks.  The Home Office has a PS22.8million five-year contract with Teleperformance to provide 'contact centre services' including a 'passport advice service for HM Passport Office'. And the newspaper claimed that Dr Tierney claimed nearly PS4,000 in expenses for 20 trips to London over a 16-month period between March 2020 and July 2021.  But Mr Rycroft told MailOnline of the Telegraph's article: 'This story totally ignores reality. Abi is a hugely talented leader, heading up our world-class visa and passport operations. With sites spread across the UK, Abi works day-in, day-out with teams around the country delivering vital services for the British public. 'Abi's work location has had precisely zero bearing on the current situation with passports, which has largely resulted from a drop in renewals during the pandemic. Our teams are working flat out to meet the demand. 'We are proud to be spreading opportunity and talent across the country, moving away from the outdated notion that everything must be done in London.' Sources within the department said Dr Tierney's role also covers UK Visas & Immigration (UKVI), which also has offices around the country - and that being based in the East Midlands places her closer to the majority of Passport Office and UKVI teams including in Durham, Peterborough, Sheffield, Liverpool and Glasgow. And a Home Office spokesman told MailOnline today: 'We have Passport Offices in a range of locations across the UK, with 90 per cent of our staff based outside London. It is therefore ludicrous to suggest that any senior leader not living there would impact on their ability to do their job to the highest standards. 'As part of the Government's Levelling Up agenda, we are proud that we are spreading opportunities and leadership roles more evenly around the country and we will continue to do this - it is only right that we attract the best talent from across the UK.' Dr Tierney previously worked as business development Director for Serco, a private contractor for various public services, and has a PhD from the University of Oxford.  She has also held operational roles in Serco such as regional director and chief executive of Suffolk Community Services, and was also previously a director at University Hospitals of Leicester and Aberdeen City Council, and worked as a marketing leader for IBM Global Business Services.  BY JAMES ROBINSON FOR MAILONLINE Britons say their holiday plans are being thrown into doubt because of 'nightmare' delays in receiving their new passports. Families say they fear missing out on long-awaited trips because they have not yet received the important travel documents - despite applying for them months ago. One family revealed how they are yet to receive a passport nearly two months after ordering it - even after shelling out an extra PS120 to 'fast track' their application. Meanwhile, a wedding photographer said she faces losing out on a PS3,000 job in France because her passport has not arrived - despite her applying for it back in September.   One family told MailOnline how they face losing out on a PS1,200 holiday to Spain next month because they are still without one of their passports. Ellie Freeman, from Nottinghamshire, said her family are still waiting on one passport in order to travel to the Spanish coastal town of Tossa Del Mar next month. Her and her partner Jordan ordered passports for themselves and their two children, one aged four and the other 9 months old, at the start of March. At the time, the Passport Office recommended a wait time of between three and five weeks - meaning the couple had given themselves plenty of time. They have since received three out of four passports, but are still awaiting the travel document for their youngest child. Desperate to go on holiday, the couple say they shelled out an extra PS100 in order to 'fast track' the passport application with the hope of receiving it within a week. But with the days ticking down to their flight, they are still yet to receive the travel document. Hotel worker Ellie, 26, who also missed out on a trip to Corfu in May last year due to Covid restrictions, said: 'It's been an absolute nightmare. 'And it's the hope that's making it worse. I would rather they just say it won't be here, because we have to make plans. 'I've seen some people getting there's 48 hours before - which is fine if it's a stag weekend abroad, but it's hard if you have children because there is lots of planning involved.' Ellie's partner Jordan, 27, who works in customer services, said the couple face losing all of their money as a result of the passport delays - because it is not covered on travel insurance. 'We've been left in limbo,' he said. 'We've gone without a lot of extras to save up just to go on holiday as a family 'If they had just told us a few weeks ago we might have been able to make changes to our booking but this close to the travel date it is non-refundable. So we are going to lose that PS1,200 if we can't go.' One photographer also told MailOnline how she faced losing PS3,000 worth of business because of the issue. Kerri Cuthbert, who runs a photography business, Rockford Studio, in Devon, said she ordered a new passport in September after her previous passport expired. But she says she is yet to receive the travel document - forcing her to cancel a wedding job in Bordeaux in June. She said: 'It's now nearly May, and I am due to travel in June, and I have now had to inform the bride and groom at very short notice that they will need to look for a plan B.  'It is a huge loss to my already suffering business post-lockdown, of nearly PS3,000, along with the time already spent planning with the client.  'I renewed my passport back in September when it expired. At first they said it might have been lost and I've been toing and froing trying to find out where it is. 'I only received a message three days ago to say it had turned up. This will have a massive impact on me trying to get my business going again after the pandemic.'  Another holiday hopeful also told MailOnline how they now face losing out on PS1,800 due to delays in receiving their passport. Kym Wylnp said she planned to take her daughter and her four-year-old son away to Spain next month. The 62-year-old local authority worker her daughter's passport has been delayed and without the document she is unable to order a passport for her son. 'She needs the passport in order to order he son's passport because she needs ID. We ordered them in January so we thought it would be here by at least April. It's been an absolute nightmare. 'We've been teaching him (my grandson) little bits of Spanish and I've been paying for swimming lessons because there's a waterpark. 'He's only four, so he's had half of his life disrupted by Covid, and this is the last chance to go on a holiday out of school terms. It would be a real shame if he couldn't go.'   Meanwhile the French-owned company contracted to run the Passport Office's contact centre was ordered to hire more people to ease 'unacceptable' delays. Teleperformance, the private firm responsible for the office's call handling, has been 'urgently tasked to add additional staff' by the Home Office. Dr Tierney will discuss Teleperformance's problems with its chief executive this week, according to The Times.  The company has been heavily criticised by exasperated applicants in recent weeks.  The Home Office has a PS22.8million five-year contract with Teleperformance to provide 'contact centre services' including a 'passport advice service for HM Passport Office'. Priti Patel's department is piling the pressure on the Passport Office to avoid a summer of chaos after five million people did not renew their travel documents during the pandemic. Ministers hope the ten-week target for passport applications will not need to be extended further, amid continued warnings of delays and cancelled holidays. Home Office minister Kevin Foster said yesterday that his advice remains unchanged and anyone heading overseas this summer should submit new passport applications and renewals as soon as possible. But he added in the House of Commons: 'We are making a range of efforts - staff are working weekends, incentivised overtime - and certainly we're confident we will not need to change the ten-week target.' MPs heard that HM Passport Office provides an expedited service where an application from the UK has been with them for longer than ten weeks, with Mr Foster confirming 42 applications have been pushed through under this criterion since March 31. A total of 9.5million British passport applications are expected to be dealt with in 2022, with Covid restrictions on travel resulting in just four million applications in 2020 and five million in 2021 by comparison. Labour urged ministers to 'get a grip' rather than float the prospect of privatising HM Passport Office. Mr Foster, responding to an urgent question from shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, said March saw the 'highest total for any month on record, with HM Passport Office completing the processing of over one million applications - 13 per cent higher than the previous record output'. He added that more than 90 per cent of applications were issued within six weeks in the period between January and March, saying: 'My advice to anyone who is looking to go on holiday this summer is exactly what I said the other day, which is to get your application in now.' For Labour, Ms Cooper warned: 'My constituents fear their honeymoon may now be wrecked because their passports haven't arrived, even though they applied in plenty of time. We've had cases of people cancelling jobs, parents trying to get holiday for a sick child waiting since January, huge long delays by the Passport Office and by the contractor TNT. 'The message today on the one-week fast track service says 'System busy, please try again later', and the online premium service has no appointments anywhere in the country. 'So people can't get urgent travel such as to go to funerals or to go to urgent events.' Ms Cooper said the increase in demand was 'totally predictable', adding the Home Office is 'in danger becoming a stay-at-Home-Office'. She questioned if the Government tried to recruit 1,700 staff but only got 500, adding: 'The Prime Minister has said the answer may be to privatise the Passport Office, but why don't Home Office ministers just get a grip instead?' On Tuesday, a senior Government source said Prime Minister Boris Johnson is ready to 'privatise the arse' out of the Passport Office amid fears that families could miss out on their summer holidays due to delays in renewing their documents. Conservative former minister David Jones pressed ministers to pursue privatisation as he told MPs about a Clwyd West constituent who hopes to go on holiday in May but whose passport application is currently stuck in limbo and who is finding it 'almost impossible to speak to any representative of the Passport Office'. Mr Jones said: 'I heard this morning that the Prime Minister has threatened the Passport Office with privatisation. May I suggest to him that he shouldn't shy away from that? If it can be done more efficiently by the private sector, then for goodness sake enlist the private sector.' Mr Foster replied: 'Just to be clear, there is a range of private contractors already involved in the passport process. The bit that isn't undertaken by private contractors is the decision itself.' Conservative chairman of the Transport Committee Huw Merriman warned about the impact of the passport backlog on the economy. He said: 'The year before Covid, the aviation industry contributed PS22billion to the UK economy, PS3.6billion to the Exchequer from air passenger duty, and it's expected to be at 70 per cent demand this summer, so we can't put this at risk for the sake of our economy.' Earlier, Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said the Government is willing to consider changing the controller of passport services, but no decision has yet been taken. On Monday, Mr Johnson said the public deserves a 'cheaper, faster' passport service as he refused to rule out privatisation if it cannot clear the backlog of applications. A senior Government source said the Prime Minister was ready to 'privatise the a**e' out of the Passport Office amid fears families could miss out on their summer holidays due to delays in renewing their documents. And in an interview with TalkTV, Mr Johnson said his sole concern was to 'deliver value and a good service' to the public. 'I am not going to rule anything out. I don't mind whether it is in the public or the private sector,' he said. 'What I want is for it to deliver value for money and help people's costs. If you want to go on holiday with your family it can cost hundreds of pounds to get new passports. You deserve to have a cheaper, faster service.' The Prime Minister is understood to be 'horrified' at the backlog in dealing with passport applications. He is said to be concerned that families wanting to go on summer holidays are under pressure to pay up to PS100 extra per passport for fast-track applications because of delays. A source cautioned that privatisation would not be the starting point, but warned that Downing Street could look to businesses to take over if passport bosses could not meet the 10-week target for standard applications costing PS75.50. In his interview, Mr Johnson acknowledged that he had criticised 'post-Covid, work-from-home, manana culture' at some of the bodies for not adapting after the easing of coronavirus restrictions. As well as the Passport Office, MPs have been raising concerns over significant delays in turning around applications for licences at the DVLA. 'I think that we have a general issue in some of our approach to public services. We all got used to working from home, Zoom calls,' Mr Johnson said. 'I am the custodian of the public purse I have to ask myself whether it is as productive as all that.' In response to the criticism of the Passport Office's handling of the situation, a spokesman for the Passport Office said: 'Since April 2021, we have been advising people to allow up to 10 weeks when applying for their British passport as more than five million people delayed applying due to the pandemic. 'We urge people who need a new passport to apply for one as soon as possible, with the vast majority of all passport applications being dealt with well within 10 weeks. 'To deal with this demand, we have increased staff numbers by 500 since April 2021. This has helped us to handle more applications than ever before, with more than one million passport applications processed in March 2022.'",
  "f94e26eb17da609c821e984e5b11ebec70bebe6723affcbd7282bb9c": "Labour former Cabinet minister Liam Byrne is set to be suspended from the House of Commons after being found to have bullied a staff member during Britain's first Covid lockdown. A parliamentary watchdog found the Birmingham Hodge Hill MP had committed a 'serious breach' of Commons' bullying and harassment rules. They said that Mr Byrne, 51, had been 'abusing his position of power' and 'ostracizing' his employee David Barker, who has agreed to be named, while he worked in the MP's constituency office. This included Mr Byrne 'ceasing personal contact with him for several months and denying him access to his Parliamentary IT account', such as disabling his work emails. It was said that the impact of Mr Byrne's behaviour was 'compounded by the fact' it occurred between March 2020 and the end of July that year, during the first national lockdown. This saw Mr Barker, who had 'undergone a period of ill health', be 'physically separated from work colleagues' and 'uncertain of his future work status'. Mr Barker made seven allegations of bullying against Mr Byrne, but only one was upheld by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Kathryn Stone. She found the MP had 'ostracized' his staff member following a dispute between the pair at the constituency office, which had led Mr Byrne to send Mr Barker home. The commissioner ruled Mr Byrne's behaviour was 'malicious' and 'involved a significant misuse of power' in the context of Mr Barker's ill health and the Covid lockdown. Mr Barker had appealed the Commissioner's decision not to uphold two of his other allegations. But these were rejected by a sub-panel of the Independent Expert Panel, which determines appeals and sanctions in cases where complaints have been brought against MPs of bullying, harassment or sexual misconduct. The sub-panel concluded: 'This case involves a serious breach of the bullying and harassment policy which arose from the respondent abusing his position of power and ostracizing the complainant, who was his employee, by ceasing personal contact with him for several months and denying him access to his Parliamentary IT account. 'The impact of this behaviour was compounded by the fact that it occurred during the first period of lockdown when the complainant was physically separated from work colleagues, uncertain of his future work status and had undergone a period of ill health.' They also said Mr Byrne's decision not to engage with Mr Barker following what he perceived to be acts of misconduct 'was not, as he argued, a reasonable HR strategy'. 'It was bullying,' the sub-panel added. 'He should, as he now accepts, have tackled any alleged misconduct through a proper disciplinary process not by ostracizing the complainant.'  The sub-panel accepted the MP had 'demonstrated genuine remorse'. But they questioned whether he 'fully understood the extent of his wrongdoing as he implied that his lack of understanding of the term 'ostracization' within the bullying and harassment policy, and the complainant's behaviour, somehow excused his actions'. It has been recommended that Mr Byrne be suspended from the Commons for two sitting days. He has also been told to make a written apology to his former staff member, undertake training, and 'take action to address the causes of his behaviour and weaknesses in the management of his office'. Mr Byrne accepted the decision by the sub-panel. In a statement, the MP said he was 'profoundly sorry' for the 'distress' caused by his ostracism of Mr Barker. He added: 'I have apologised in full to the individual concerned. 'I'm incredibly grateful to the panel for recognising the genuine remorse I felt about the impact on the individual concerned, the steps I have already taken to ensure this never happens again along with the work still to do, and for concluding that I did not deliberately act to delay the investigation. 'This has been a valuable lesson for me and one I am determined to learn as me and my team seek to offer the best possible service and voice for the residents of Hodge Hill.' Mr Byrne was first elected as an MP in 2004 and went on to serve in the Cabinet of former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown, including as Chief Secretary to the Treasury. When Labour lost power following the 2010 general election and in the wake of the financial crisis, Mr Byrne was revealed to have left a note for his incoming successor as Chief Secretary, which read: 'I'm afraid there is no money.' Mr Byrne later apologised over the 'offensive' note, which had become the basis of many Conservative attacks on Labour's record in charge of the public finances. Last year, Mr Byrne stood as Labour's candidate for West Midlands Mayor but was beaten by the Tory incumbent Andy Street. In 2008, a leaked 11-page document issued to civil servants revealed Mr Byrne's demands while he worked in government. The document, titled Working with Liam Byrne, even included the minister's food and drink preferences. It read: 'Coffee/Lunch. I'm addicted to coffee. I like a cappuccino when I come in, an espresso at 3pm and soup at 12.30-1pm.'",
  "42e9c036526de3f63b5b2a13dd0b89b2f2171834e4f91c2adb8ddd85": "Rishi Sunak has warned that homeowners will see mortgage repayments rise by more than PS1,000 a year with interest rates set to increase by 2.5 per cent over the next 12 months. The Chancellor warned cabinet colleagues to avoid borrowing more to fund public spending as it risked stoking inflation even further. He warned that a 1 percentage point increase on a typical mortgage would result in an extra PS700 for those not on fixed-rate deals. Mr Sunak, who is facing pressure from Tory MPs to ease pressure on people during the cost of living crisis, was quizzed yesterday by Mumsnet about how someone in his position can empathise with hard-up Britons. He cited his grandparents who emigrated to the UK 'with very little', adding: 'Of course now I'm in a fortunate position but I didn't start like that, that's not how my family started.' But he provoked a fresh row after he argued it would be 'silly' to offer families further help with soaring energy bills right now, despite forecasters predicting rises of as much as 40 per cent in October, equating to nearly PS3,000 a year. Mr Sunak also warned oil and gas giants that they face a windfall tax on their profits if they do not increase investment to shore up Britain's energy supplies. The Chancellor seemed to signal an about-turn on Government opposition to a one-off raid on energy firms despite fears it could hit investment and jobs. He said: 'If we don't see that type of investment coming forward and if the companies are not going to make those investments in our country and in our energy security, then of course that's something I would look at.' Mr Sunak warned that 'nothing is ever off the table in these things', despite ministers ruling out a windfall tax last month. Kwasi Kwarteng, the Business Secretary, had warned the move would be 'a tax on jobs, would harm investment and add to the uncertainty in oil markets'. Mr Sunak's warning shot was fired during a discussion with users of the Mumsnet website in which the Chancellor, who has faced controversy over his family's fortune, defended himself against claims he is out of touch. He was cleared yesterday of breaching the ministerial code over his family's financial affairs. The Prime Minister's ethics watchdog found Mr Sunak had not broken rules on conflicts of interest by holding a US green card. Mr Sunak referred himself for investigation after it emerged that his wife, Akshata Murty, held non-domiciled tax status, exempting her from paying UK tax on overseas earnings. Lord Geidt found two instances where Miss Murty's tax status 'could have given rise to a conflict of interest' for the Chancellor. But the adviser on ministerial interests found that, in the first, the issue was properly declared, and in the second, a proposed change for some non-dom individuals did not affect Mr Sunak's wife. In advice to the PM, Lord Geidt wrote: 'I advise that the requirements of the ministerial code have been adhered to by the Chancellor, and that he has been assiduous in meeting his obligations and in engaging with this investigation.' The adviser did not believe Mr Sunak having held a US green card 'would constitute an inherent conflict of interest'. He was also satisfied that there was no conflict of interest over both Mr Sunak's blind investment trust and Miss Murty's reported 0.91 per cent stake in Infosys, an Indian IT firm founded by her billionaire father. Tulip Siddiq, Labour's shadow economic secretary to the Treasury, said: 'How out of touch is this Chancellor? It's time to act.' Meanwhile, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner branded Lord Geidt's report an 'utter whitewash'. Miss Murty, an Indian citizen said to be worth hundreds of millions, earlier this month agreed to pay UK taxes on her worldwide income. The cost of living crisis will have longer-term implications for households and the UK economy, experts have warned, as Britons are cut back on all sorts of spending and are borrowing to make ends meet. The rise in costs is already affecting almost everyone - around nine in 10 adults have reported an increase in their cost of living last month, new official figures show.  Nearly a quarter of people said they were struggling to pay household bills last month, according to the latest survey by the Office for National Statistics. A bigger proportion - two in five - said they found it 'very or somewhat difficult' to afford their energy bills in March - and that's even before the increase in the energy price cap came into force at the start of April. To cope with the rise in the cost of living, large numbers of families are cutting back on spending - both essential and non-essentials - while some are dipping into savings if they have them, and others are taking on debt.  The most common action was spending less on non-essentials, like going out for dinner or clothes, with over half of Brits saying they did that in March. Turning off the heating and cutting back on electricity use was the second most common move by those trying to cut back on spending - 45 per cent of households did so last month. Some 39 per cent also said they had reduced their non-essential car journeys to save on petrol, while a similar percentage shopped around more to find better deals and a third are cutting back on essentials like food. Meanwhile, nearly a quarter of people dipped into their savings, 11 per cent said they were borrowing more than usual and some 7 per cent asked friends and family for help.  Only 12 per cent of people in Britain said they were not not doing anything in response to the cost of living crisis, the survey shows.    Amin Khan, owner of sustainable clothing retailer, PrimaBerry, says he has cut back on memberships and subscriptions to pay for rising energy bills, as he works from home.  'After reading countless articles with tips and tricks about how to save on bills, I started to panic, which led me to write down all my memberships, subscriptions, direct debits and any other bills and see what could I cancel or downgrade.  'After all the reductions, I am now saving around PS200 monthly, which will definitely help me to pay for any gas and electricity increase as I work from home.' He added: 'I forecasted to sell more than what I am selling at the moment but due the circumstances it is understandable why so many small businesses are struggling. Everything is going up in price but I am trying to not raise my own prices up as much as I can.' Natalie Fletcher, owner of Manchester-based micro manufacturer, Mancmade, says she has no disposable income due to rising costs.  '2021 was a challenge financially but 2022 is taking things to a whole new level in terms of soaring energy, food and fuel costs.  'I also provide a mobile clothing alterations and delivery service to my customers, and the cost of fuel has wiped me out. 'I currently don't have any disposable income, as it all seems to be going on the fuel that is used when delivering to customers.  'No way are this Government doing enough about 'levelling up' as they need to be. In fact, they have done nothing to stop the income inequalities that are seemingly set in stone.' Fanny Snaith, a Cheltenham-based certified money coach, says she will have to increase her income significantly - by 15 per cent or more - to absorb price hikes.  She said: 'As a landlord of a house of multiple occupancy, the utility bills are included in the rent.  'It is not possible to simply raise the rent for many different reasons. That means that we need to be able to absorb the huge energy bill rises, plus the other hikes, too. So that is a hit to income. 'I sense a real danger area here, for landlords and tenants alike.' Jack Leslie, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said all of this was already showing up in falls in consumer confidence.   March saw the largest 12-month fall in consumer confidence since the financial crisis, according to their analysis of figures by the OECD.  'Lower consumer demand will be a challenge for lots of businesses,' he said.  He also expects the crisis to have implications for households and the wider UK economy in the longer term.  'If someone uses up their savings this year to cope with their living costs, that obviously means they don't have those savings to use in the future,' he says.  'The same is true with debt but could also be worse for those who struggle to pay back, potentially affecting credit ratings and therefore longer-term borrowing costs.  'From a macroeconomic perspective, when consumer demand falls that leads to a slowdown in the broader economy. We know that recessions, and economic slowdowns more broadly, can last quite a long time.' At the same time, certain rise in costs could prompt more permanent behavioural changes in some parts of the population.  For example, if higher proportions of people are trying to cut back on fuel/energy usage, that could lead to more people walking and cycling for transport or encouraging better home insulation.  'Those factors could have longer-term effects if they persist once energy prices come back down,' Leslie added. Separate research from MetLife, an insurance company, found that one in six people have cut back costs and 57 per cent say they expect to do so soon. People were most likely to consider giving up everyday perks such as eating lunch out (40 per cent), luxury items (37 per cent), holidays and day trips (34 per cent), socialising (32 per cent) and entertainment subscriptions (28 per cent). My husband I are looking to move to a bigger home, as our two children are getting to the age where they don't want to share a bedroom and we need the extra space. After seeing a few places we liked, we went to our current mortgage lender to get an agreement in principle - but we were turned down for the amount we wanted. I've heard that some banks - including ours - are making it harder to get a mortgage because they are taking higher energy bills and taxes into account. Our bills have risen considerably in the last few months as our fixed energy tariff ran out. Could this be why we were rejected, and if so is there anything we can do about it? I also have a few late car finance payments on my record from when I was made redundant about three years ago. I was back in work a few months later, the car is now paid off, and we have always been on time with the mortgage and our other bills. We're worried about approaching too many lenders, and are wondering which ones are likely to accept us. I've seen some lenders online who say they are more 'flexible' when it comes to helping people with imperfect credit history. Is this worth looking into, and what's the catch? The alternative is to put off our move, but with our kids growing up that's not going to be practical for more than a couple of years. Helen Crane of This is Money replies: Getting turned down for a mortgage at the first hurdle is disheartening - especially when you have outgrown your current home and have a pressing need to move. Sadly, you are not alone. Many people applying for a mortgage today might find it a bit more difficult to get accepted than they would have a few months ago. This is for several reasons.  First of all, interest rates are rising. According to Moneyfacts, the average two-year fixed rate - covering all deposit sizes - is currently 2.86 per cent, up from 2.65 per cent in March.  On a PS200,000 mortgage, this would mean paying PS258 more per year if it had been taken out in April compared to March. That might not seem like a lot, but it could tip the scales from being approved for a mortgage and turned down. The situation could be more severe for those for those with big mortgages relative to their income, or whose current fixed deal is cheaper than those on the market today. Additionally, households are being hit by the cost of living crisis which has seen the price of essentials such as gas and electricity, petrol and grocery shopping rocket. Lenders are increasingly taking these higher bills into account when assessing whether borrowers could afford to pay a mortgage. Santander, for example, has already factored increased national insurance, household expenditure and dividend income tax rates into its affordability calculations. Others are expected to do the same. In your case, you are unsure whether the rejection was down to your increased living costs, your previous debts - or something else. You are keen to find out, because approaching too many lenders in search of a mortgage could damage your credit profile and make things worse. As a first port of call, I would advise going back to your lender and asking for further information on why the application was turned down. There is no reason why it should not be able to provide this. Armed with that knowledge, you will then be able to come up with a plan of action for starting a new application that is more likely to be accepted. This could mean looking at a cheaper property, but the problem might also be solved by saving a slightly larger deposit or considering a different lender.  To help you assess your options, I spoke to Elena Todorova, director of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients; Courtney Flockhart, mortgage broker at Henry Dannell; James Briggs, head of personal finance intermediary sales at specialist lender Together; and Adrian Anderson, director at mortgage broker Anderson Harris. Courtney Flockhart says: Each lender will have its own internal credit scoring system, which is different to a credit score on Experian or Equifax.  Somebody who has a 999 score on Experian could easily fail a lenders' credit score tests, especially if they had a small deposit relative to the property's value. There will be tiered 'pass marks' based on both the borrowers' credit history and their ability to pay the mortgage alongside their other financial commitments. These approval thresholds will change depending on the borrowers' income, the size of their deposit and how much they want to borrow.  James Briggs says: We're in the worst cost of living crisis since the 1980s, and sadly there will be many other potential buyers in this same situation. Many banks and mortgage lenders have reviewed how they assess affordability given the current spike in family outgoings on food, fuel bills and taxes, coupled with rising inflation. Some are changing their household expenditure calculations to consider factors such as the size of the family or the number of vehicles they own. These changes have been made to make sure people's monthly payments are affordable.  However, they don't account for people's individual circumstances meaning people who could otherwise afford a mortgage won't meet these broad-brush requirements. There will be a lot of 'computer says no' type responses. Adrian Anderson says: When factoring in affordability for a mortgage most banks use Office for National Statistics data to presume certain household outgoings. As the cost of household outgoings (including utility bills) has increased, according to the ONS - and is expected to continue to increase - most banks have factored this into the affordability calculators.  This may have an impact on some applicants' ability to borrow the amount they are seeking now. Elena Todorova says: It is disappointing to hear that the couple's bank refused to lend without clear explanation.  However, it does not necessarily follow that the decline was down to an assessment on the increased cost of living and adverse credit. It may be purely technical as the case may just fall outside of credit policy - for example, it may be a few thousand pounds short on income multiples, or applying for an incorrect term. Adrian Anderson says: Late payments on a finance agreement can reduce your credit score.  You should obtain a copy of your credit report through one of the credit reference agencies so that you are aware of any negative entries that may go against you. If there is a genuine explanation regarding why there were some late payments on your record for car finance, a mortgage broker may be able to use their relationships with the underwriters at the competitively priced mainstream or high street banks to explain the circumstances.  This could help you avoid using a 'flexible' or 'specialist' bank which may charge a higher rate of interest. Elena Todorova says: Credit history remains on file for a minimum of six years (longer if the commitment is unsatisfied or unpaid).  This could be a reasonable cause for borrowing being declined, but if it was three or more years ago, certain lenders may be prepared to look at the case more sympathetically. Lenders who may consider to lend in this instance range from high-street lenders offering competitive terms, to smaller banks or building societies which could be more expensive but offer flexible underwriting. Elena Todorova says: The mortgage term can be adjusted to suit the couple's plans.  They could potentially take a longer term [these are available up to 40 years] if it eases affordability models and reduces monthly outgoings, as long as it fits with lenders' maximum age limits. It's important to consider different terms and rates and discuss their monthly budget as ultimately, the couple has to be comfortable with the mortgage payments they will pay now, and in the future. Adrian Anderson says: The best way to avoid approaching multiple lenders and give yourself the best possible chance of securing the mortgage you are seeking is to speak to an independent expert.  They will have the knowledge of how to navigate you through the banks, hopefully meaning fewer failed applications and marks on your credit file.  James Briggs says: Specialist lenders differ to traditional banks as they can make more pragmatic individual lending decisions, considering the applicant's actual circumstances and expenditure on a case-by-case basis.   These types of lenders are also typically more flexible when dealing with mortgage applications from people with a less-than-perfect credit history, as is the case here, particularly if the outstanding debt has now been settled.  As a trade-off for this increased flexibility, borrowers should expect to stump up a larger deposit, typically between 15 per cent and 25 per cent of the purchase price of their new home.  Many specialist lenders' products are only available through mortgage brokers, so I would recommend speaking to a Financial Conduct Authority authorised broker. Helen Crane, This is Money, replies:  I hope the responses above have shown you that all is not lost, and that - depending on your exact circumstances - there are several options you can explore for getting your mortgage.  It may be that the amount you asked for in your application was just slightly too high to tick the affordability check box given your income, outgoings or deposit size.  That is hopefully reasonably easy to rectify by adjusting your budget downwards just a little, elongating your mortgage term slightly or even just seeking a mortgage with a better interest rate to bring down your projected outgoings.  If you do find that it is the cost of living or your credit record that is causing the issue, you may want to take some time to consider what the best course of action is, and how your circumstances might change.  For example, if it is the increased cost of living that is hampering your application, perhaps you or your husband might have a chance to get a modest pay rise in the near future, which could tip you over the affordability threshold.  And if it is the previous debts that are making things difficult, another year or so of building your credit score back up could help, too.  When the time is right, using a broker should help you avoid more failed applications and ensure that you approach the right lender and get a mortgage deal that works for you.  Although your children are growing up fast, some careful planning should mean you secure the home you want in the not too distant future. ",
  "5388d8e2832b9e8abe77fca61ab007e27e314ed4df963adc9d6ddf2d": "Johnny Depp's former agent Christian Carino told the court about emails sent to him by Heard after she broke up with Elon Musk. Heard began dating the Tesla founder around the time of her split with Depp in May 2016 and by August the following year they had broken up. Carino, a talent agent with mega agency CAA and Lady Gaga's ex-fiance, appeared by a pre-recorded video deposition and confirmed that Heard and Musk were in a relationship for a time. Asked if Heard moved on to dating Musk 'immediately after Johnny Depp', Carino said yes. In an email on August 7, 2017, Heard told Carino: 'Dealing with breakup. I hate when things go public. See I'm so sad.' Carino said that he believed Heard was 'referring to breaking up with Elon.' Carino replied to Heard: 'You weren't in love with him. You told me 1,000 times you were just feeling space.' Asked what he meant, Carino said: 'Why would you be sad if you weren't in love with him to begin with?' One of Depp's lawyers asked: 'By him you're referring to who?' Carino said: 'Elon.' Heard's next email read: 'I know but I wanted time to grieve and recover in my own time.' In another email in the same conversation she said: 'I hate that, yet again a man lets me fall on the spikes by myself.' Carino said: 'How so?' Heard emailed back: 'They're mad at me for leaving them and put things like this out there', apparently referring to the story going public. Carino responded: 'You could avoid all this if you stop dating uber famous people.' Asked what he meant in the email, Carino told the court he was trying to tell Heard: 'If you don't like being in the press about your personal life don't date people that are famous.' Carino told the court that Heard's feelings for Depp lingered after she filed for divorce in May 2016 and that he believed she wanted to reconcile with him, even though she was dating Musk. In an email on July 14 that year, Heard told Carino: 'It's so f**ked up I just want to tell him that what they're telling him isn't true.' In an email sent to Carino around the same time, Heard said: 'Please tell him I love him,' referring to Depp. The court heard that in the summer of 2016, Heard asked Carino to set up a meeting with Depp to talk things over. At the time Depp was the subject of a temporary restraining order and Heard said she could 'never accuse him of violating the order' during their meeting, Carino said. It took place in San Francisco where Depp was on tour with his band, The Hollywood Vampires, in the backyard of a friend's house. Carino said they were there for 'several hours' chatting until the owner of the house said he was coming back. To continue the conversation they rented a hotel room but once there Depp and Heard 'started arguing,' Carino testified. Carino said that he left at 5am the following morning - it wasn't clear if the argument was still ongoing. But the court has already heard chilling audio of Depp asking Heard to cut him with a knife, telling her: 'You f**king hate me!' Despite that, Heard's feeling for Depp remained strong. On August 16, 2017, Heard emailed Carino: 'I've written so many notes, can you give him one? I don't know how or where to start. 'Finally I am single, clear in my heart and mind. I just want him to know I loved him.' In a message on June 9, 2018 - six months before Heard wrote the op-ed which is the subject of the case - she messaged Carino: 'God I miss him,' referring to Depp. Earlier in the day, Depp cracked up with laughter as the doorman of his building described how Amber Heard asked him to investigate an intruder due to scratches on their front door - which were caused by the dog. Alejandro Romero said that Heard and her friend Rocky Pennington told him that 'somebody tried to get into my unit' at the Eastern Columbia Building in West Hollywood. Appearing in a pre-taped video deposition, Romero said he thought to himself: 'What? Four inches above the (floor)? The dog was scratching.' He said: 'In my head (I'm thinking) you think someone is trying to get into your unit with scratches four inches above the floor?' At this point Depp started laughing and there was laughter in the public gallery. Romero said: 'They were so scared. They asked me to go inside the unit to check room by room. I did it, it's part of my job.' At one point Romero, who was giving the deposition in his car on his cell phone, could be seen blowing smoke out his nose having apparently just taken a hit from a vaping device. Losing patience he began to drive around, still talking to one of Heard's lawyers on his phone which was stuck on his dashboard. Afterwards Bredehoft, Heard's lawyer, said it was 'the most bizarre deposition' she had ever done. Judge Penney Azcarate added: 'I've never seen that before.' At one point Romero lost his cool and spoke of his frustration at having to speak to the lawyers. He said: 'Ugh. I'm so stressed out because of this, I don't want to deal with this any more'. Romero met Heard on May 25, 2016, four days after the final argument between Heard and Depp before the divorce. She claims he hit her with a mobile phone at the apartment - he denies it. Romero said that he didn't see any bruises and cuts on Heard's face at the time and she was 3ft away from him. Asked if he would have seen anything, given they were so close and the light was good, he said: 'That's correct'. Depp laughed again as an exasperated Romero said he wasn't checking if Heard's 'eyelashes are not even'. There was laughter in court once more when Romero said in response to another question: 'I don't remember what I got for breakfast'. Earlier in the day, a Los Angeles police officer who attended the final argument between Depp and Heard before their divorce said she could have had a red face after 'crying because (her) dog died.' Tyler Hadden said that because Heard was 'uncooperative' he had no idea why she was upset having called 911 at her West Hollywood penthouse. Heard claimed that Depp smacked her with a mobile phone during the May 2016 argument but clammed up when officers arrived. Officer Hadden told the former couple's $100m defamation trial he categorized the incident as a 'verbal dispute' only. The cop told the jury he saw no evidence of injuries on Heard and that her red face was 'consistent with crying'. He said that 'just because I see a female with pink cheeks and pink eyes doesn't mean something happened'. Officer Hadden said the red face could be because the person 'started crying because their dog died'. The question of Heard's injuries that night are crucial to the case as a week later she filed for divorce and obtained a restraining order against Depp, accusing him of domestic violence. She arrived at court with a large bruise on her right cheek, a picture of which was entered into the court file. LAPD officer William Gatlin told the court that he and a colleague went to see Heard again at 10.24pm that night. It appeared that a friend of Heard's had called the New York police department about the incident, and they wanted to return to check on her themselves. The court was shown footage from officer Gatlin's body camera which showed them entering the building and walking down the corridor to the penthouse. Heard's friend Josh Drew answered the door and tried to persuade the officers to leave by telling them that other cops had already come by, but they insisted on going in. Officer Gatlin agreed that Drew was 'uncooperative'. The footage showed the cops entering and asking if Heard was OK, and she confirmed she was. Drew says that Depp is 'definitely' not there any more and had been gone a few hours and the officers left. Officer Gatlin said that when they went inside 'it didn't seem like anybody was particularly eager to talk to us'. The cop said that due to the 'dim lighting' he couldn't see if Heard had any bruises on her face or not. The cop said that based on the LAPD's investigation it appeared Heard was not a victim of domestic violence. He said: 'Based on her refusing to give any statement on what occurred and at the time we did not observe any visible or verifiable injuries to her'. However officer Gatlin said he was 'not in a position' to say if Depp beat up Heard as he was not there when the incident occurred. Officer Gatlin was asked about claims by Heard's former lawyer Adam Waldman in media interviews that Heard and her friends were 'attempting to concoct an abuse hoax.' The cop said he could not recall seeing anything like that. Officer Gatlin was asked if he saw Heard and her friends 'spilling wine and roughing the place up?' He replied that he did not. There was laughter in court when Bredehoft asked the officer if he was a 'fan' of Depp's at the time they went to the property. Officer Gatlin said: 'I guess I liked a couple of his movies, not rush out to see them or anything'. Officer Melissa Saenz appeared via a pre-taped video deposition on Tuesday. She was asked about the visit to the penthouse apartment that Depp and Heard shared on May 21, 2016. Under questioning from Heard's lawyer Elaine Bredehoft, Saenz said, 'I did not identify her as a victim of domestic violence,' adding that she did not see any evidence of a crime, including broken glass or mess in the penthouse.  It was the last argument between Depp and Heard before she filed for a divorce and a restraining order, which she did a week later. In request for the restraining order, Heard claimed that Depp hit her with a cell phone during that encounter, leaving her with a bruise on the right side of her face. In the court file, Heard included an image of the bruise. Bredehoft showed the photo photo of Amber's face to Saenz and asked ,'Do you perceive there to be an injury or evidence of injury on amber's face in this photo?' Saenz responded, 'No I do not.'  Bredehoft asked, 'What is your perception of the redness on the cheek and the eyelid and above the eyebrow?' Saenz responded, 'Its consistent with her crying - she's fair skin, her face is flushed.'  Bredehoft asked, 'You don't think it's consistent with a cell phone being thrown at her?' Saenz responded, 'Correct, it does not look like an injury caused from a cell phone. It's consistent with someone crying.' Bredehoft asked, 'If you saw any signs of injury on Amber Heard or even just damage to the property, would you have been duty bound to make a report?' 'Correct.' Bredehoft asked, 'Now, your recollection is that there was damage to the flat, you searched the entire flat and there was no damage, no broken glass, or anything out of the ordinary, would you agree?' 'Correct' Bredehoft asked, 'When you got back to the elevator is there anything you remember thinking?' Saenz responded, 'I remember being impressed by the penthouse, how big and beautiful it was yes.' Her testimony followed expert witness Dr. Shannon Curry to the stand. The clinical and forensic psychologist told the court she concluded Heard had traits consistent with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and Histrionic Personality Disorder (HPD) - two conditions found in people with patterns of emotional instability and attention-seeking behavior.  Dr. Curry testified that she was initially hired by Depp's lawyers early last year to review files in the legal battle between the two feuding exes and identify behavior in their relationship that may be consistent with 'intimate partner violence'.  The psychology expert, however, revealed her role would shift several months later in October, when she was asked to provide a psychological evaluation of Heard, 36.  'The results of Ms. Heard's evaluation supported two diagnoses: Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and Histrionic Personality Disorder (HPD),' Curry told the court.  She concluded that Heard 'grossly exaggerated' her post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after her relationship with Depp and said that in the actress's eyes, the actor went from being 'idealized to the dumpster.' Dr. Curry noted that Heard's BPD was marked by an 'underlying terror of abandonment' and somebody with the condition tends to make 'desperate attempts' to stop it from happening. These could be 'very extreme behaviors', she said. Curry added that as a result of these disorders, somebody like Heard could appear charming at the start of a friendship or relationship but could then turn dark easily.",

The boy was found unresponsive at a home in Madora Bay, south of Perth, when police attended in relation to a noise complaint early on Wednesday. 'The attending officers provided emergency first aid to the child until St John Ambulance personnel arrived,' WA Police said in a statement on Friday. 'Tragically, the child could not be revived.' Neighbours raised the alarm shortly before 5am on Wednesday after they heard shouting and doors banging. The toddler, named Jace, lived at the rented home with his mother and grandmother. Shattered next door neighbour Stan Grostate dropped off an Easter egg for Jace several days earlier and was one of the last to see the toddler alive. He held the little boy on Tuesday night so his mother could have a cigarette.  'It's devastating. He was such a cute little boy,' Mr Grostate told reporters. 'He smiled a lot, and used to play with my cat whenever they came over. 'He had just started walking.' A 28-year-old woman has been refused bail and is due to face Perth Magistrates Court on Saturday.",
  "e98abbcf4f1969125818f7f720c8dc567dd5c2000800f05319e2f5e1": "Two British charity workers have been captured by Russian forces after going to Ukraine as humanitarian relief volunteers, it was reported today. Their capture was announced by the UK non-profit organisation Presidium Network, which say they were seized at a checkpoint on Monday south of the city of Zaporizhzhia, in south-eastern Ukraine. 'Two men who were working as civilian humanitarian relief volunteers were captured on Monday at a checkpoint south of the city of Zaporizhzhia,' the charity said in a statement to the BBC on Friday. Zaporizhzhia is a crucial way station for tens of thousands of Ukrainians fleeing Mariupol, the besieged city to the south east which has been largely captured by Russian forces and all-but razed to the ground. News of the capture of the charity workers comes a day after a British father was killed in Ukraine, and a second Briton remains missing, after the pair apparently joined local forces fighting Russia.  Scott Sibley, a veteran of the British armed forces who served in the Commando Logistic Support Squadron in Afghanistan, has been named as the first UK casualty in Ukraine. This is a breaking news story. More to follow... Russian sources also published a list of what they claim are 100 British 'mercenaries' fighting in Ukraine, including the name of one woman.  A pro-war Telegram channel called Rybar with almost 400,000 subscribers claimed the 100 British citizens whose names were published were part of the 'International Legion of Territorial Defence of Ukraine', also known as the Ukrainian Foreign Legion. The list does not include the name of Scott Sibley or two other British men who have been captured, and it is unclear how authentic it is.  On Thursday, the UK's Foreign Office confirmed British national Sibley had been killed in Ukraine and the whereabouts of a second Briton is unknown. It is thought that the two men had been fighting against Russian fighters after joining Ukrainian soldiers as volunteers, but this remains unconfirmed.  Friends of Sibley, fondly nicknamed Sibs, have paid tribute to the veteran, who is believed to have died on 23 April, and set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for his funeral. 'Scott was a son, father, brother and uncle,' his friend Craig wrote on the page. 'To me he was a friend like no other and the bravest person I've had the pleasure to have known, he was as good as a brother to me. 'His life may have been cut short but he lived to the full and did things the Sibs way, right until the end.' Another fundraising page set up for Sibley's relatives described his 'infectious laugh', adding: 'We all have memories with him and he has helped us in different ways.' Sibley leaves behind his daughter who was diagnosed with stage 4 high risk Neuroblastoma, a rare form of cancer that mostly affects young children. Following her diagnosis in 2018, Sibley shaved his head so that his daughter would not feel different when she lost her hair, reported the BBC.  Sibley's former squadron, the Army's Logistic Support Squadron, paid tribute to the veteran, writing: 'This week the Sqn has lost a former serving soldier. A man that showed Commando spirit until the end. RIP. Scott Sibley.' A former comrade, Alex Darwin, paid tribute to his friend. 'Sib, I'm in complete disbelief. What a pleasure to have served alongside you, to know you and to have experienced your kind nature. 'You were there for me and I will forever be grateful. One hell of a beautiful guy, inside and out.'",

The satirical skit showed Senator Wong bringing a batch of fake votes to a Covid-positive Anthony Albanese, saying: 'I brought you these.  'These are postal votes under the names of dead people, fake identities, some were stolen out of letterboxes.' The fake Ms Wong then made false claims that the Australian Electoral Commission doesn't check identification documents as that would be 'racist'. The skit - one of a lengthy series by Ms Hanson's team - prompted a warning from the AEC - and later its deletion or restriction by a series of social media platforms. Senator Hanson shared a series of screenshots showing Facebook was unable to be viewed by users. 'Your post goes against our Community Standards on voter suppression,' the warning said. The politician claimed TikTok had 'censored' the episode and Twitter was limiting shares and likes. The AEC said earlier on Friday: 'We agree that satire is an important tool and it's genuinely great to see it used effectively. 'Unfortunately in this case it's been used to spread misleading information about electoral security.' The AEC wrote on a twitter thread featuring the video that Ms Hanson's attempts at undermining democratic confidence were 'extremely disappointing'.  'Aspects of it are clearly false, and any registered party would know this,' wrote the AEC. No election the AEC has run has had a margin smaller than the number of alleged multiple votes and ID is required when a voter enrols claimed the AEC addressing the claims of One Nation's cartoon. ",
  "c05c44b5600ed10221786040de2cb2b8110547064c07dcdc2ad2b980": "The victim of a savage murder described in an interview before she died how an attack by a cleaner destroyed her 'dream world' and made her to want to killer-proof her Sydney home. Ninety-two-year-old Marjorie Welsh wished to make her home more safe because of a savage attack by Hanny Papanicolaou that ultimately led to her death. In an interview recorded shortly after she was stabbed and bludgeoned by Papanicolaou on January 2, 2019, Ms Welsh said the attack had robbed her of her 'dream world' of feeling comfortable and happy within her home. 'I wouldn't trust anyone anymore. I'm having special gates when I'm back. I'm just making it thief-proof, killer-proof,' she said. In the interview, Ms Welsh is seen cut and bruised in a hospital bed less than a week after being attacked by Papanicolaou. Ms Welsh died six weeks after the attack in her Sydney inner west home. Ms Welsh's daughters Angela MacLeod and Elizabeth Welsh were watching on at a Supreme Court sentencing hearing on Friday, with Ms Welsh breaking down in sobs when her mother's interview was played. In February Papanicolaou was found guilty of the murder of Ms Welsh who was stabbed multiple times with a knife and bashed with her walking sticks and fine china. Papanicolaou had been working at Ms Welsh's house as a cleaner for a year before the attack. Crown prosecutor Christopher Taylor said Papanicolaou, 38, intended to kill Ms Welsh because she did not want to be seen breaking into her client's home in an attempted robbery. A sufficient sentence was required as a deterrent so senior citizens could live their lives without fear of violence, Mr Taylor said on Friday. As a vulnerable person who had difficulty moving or seeing, Ms Welsh was forced to the ground by Papanicolaou, who snatched her mobile phone out of her hands and unplugged a violent fall alarm from the wall. 'This was a savage and sustained attack by a young woman upon a much older woman with the use of no less than a knife to penetrate multiple times the chest and abdomen of the deceased,' Mr Taylor said. Papanicolaou's lawyers claim she intended to cause grievous bodily harm rather than murder. Her legal team also argues she was suffering from major depressive disorder, including post-natal depression from a premature birth, at the time of the attack. 'So much of Ms Papanicolaou's life has been lived without any acts of violence. She's managed to do many pro-social things. She's got plenty of incentive to reform,' said her barrister Tom Quilter. During the trial the court heard that on the morning of the attack, the regular gambler lost $430 from poker machines in under an hour and was left with just $11 in her bank account. The crown case alleged that Papanicolaou found out Ms Welsh had received $8 million from a property sale, and thought she would be away on holiday until the end of January. During her testimony, Papanicolaou told the jury she had felt increasingly isolated in an unhappy marriage, was deeply depressed and escaped her problems through gambling. Mr Quilter said while his client would spend years in jail, she deserved a shorter sentence because she had been assaulted while in prison after being seen on television over the murder trial. Speaking outside court, Ms MacLeod welcomed remarks that senior citizens deserved to feel safe within their home as a sanctuary. Ms MacLeod called her mother's video interview confronting, but said she was amazed her mother could still be herself at such a time. 'Mum was someone who could achieve anything she wanted to in life. Life wasn't always perfect for mum ... but she was strong, intelligent, loving, protective, all those things that you'd want in a mum. We were always very proud of her,' she said. Justice Robertson Wright did not hand down a prison sentence immediately but will do so at a later date.",
  "214ac14d3c3ef31051afbd6dc765c1bbb4eff8958d76d35d399d029a": "Cheap foreign agency staff hired by disgraced operator P&O Ferries to replace the nearly 800 experienced seafarers it sensationally sacked six weeks ago didn't know how to use life-saving appliances, a damning new report has found.  A total of 23 failures ranging from fire rescue boats not being properly maintained and oil filtering equipment not working to fire safety systems and deficiencies with working conditions were found by Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) inspectors on Spirit of Britain, a 700ft cross-Channel vessel impounded by UK authorities earlier this month. According to the Paris Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), which is an alliance of 27 national maritime authorities including the UK, there was a 'lack of familiarity' with the 'operation of life-saving appliances', which could relate to equipment such as rescue boats, lifeboats, life-jackets or flares. Thirty-one safety failures were also found by the MCA on another P&O Ferries vessel, European Causeway, resulting in it being detained on March 25. Analysis has revealed that was more than in any of the other 46,000 Port State Control inspections of ships within the Paris MOU in the past three years.  Spirit of Britain was detained following the inspection on April 11, before being cleared to sail on April 22. The vessel was used by P&O Ferries to restart operations between Dover and Calais on Tuesday for the first time since the company sacked hundreds of staff and replaced them with PS5.50-an-hour agency workers on March 17 to save money. The firm has been mired in controversy since it fired nearly 800 experienced seafarers with no notice last month and replaced them with cheaper foreign agency workers. Its beleaguered millionaire CEO Peter Hebblethwaite later admitted to a committee of MPs that the sackings broke the law. RMT general secretary Mick Lynch called the report 'further evidence that P&O is a capitalist bandit sailing in our waters', raging: 'The lack of care and respect P&O clearly has for safety regulations - that are designed to save lives in the event of maritime emergencies - is on a par with their appalling treatment of the loyal 800-strong workforce who were sacked last month. 'There can be no doubt that the public and haulage firms should boycott P&O Ferries on safety, security and moral grounds until the Government steps in and takes over the running of this rogue maritime operator.'  European Causeway was cleared to sail on April 8, but was left adrift in the Irish Sea for more than an hour on Tuesday after it suffered a power failure, in yet another PR crisis for the company. It was rescued by three lifeboats and a tugboat before it regained power shortly before 2.15pm, much to the relief of passengers on board who had endured blackouts. After the ship got back to the port, a number of the new crew members reportedly asked maritime unions for advice about terminating their contracts. The MCA said European Causeway can sail again with a restriction on what generators it can use for electricity. A total of eight P&O Ferries vessels will be probed by the agency following the mass sackings. Pride of Kent remains under detention after failing an inspection, while Pride of Canterbury and Spirit of France are also out of action as they have not been fully examined. Pride of Hull, Norbay and European Highlander were all allowed to resume sailings. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the Transport Select Committee on Wednesday that he ordered the MCA to scrutinise the ships 'with a fine-tooth comb'. A P&O Ferries spokesperson said: 'The safety of our passengers and crew is our foremost priority and any suggestion that it is being compromised in any way is categorically false. 'It is clear that the safety inspections of our vessels have reached an unprecedented level of rigour and we welcome this additional scrutiny to help us come back even better than before. We look forward to all of our ships welcoming tourist passengers and freight customers again as soon as all mandatory safety tests have been passed and we are satisfied the vessels are ready to re-enter service. 'Safety remains paramount in our new crewing management model, which is used by many of our competitors and has been proven to be a successful model in this industry.' The MCA has said its inspectors work 'in exactly the same robust way' for every ship. Meanwhile, there has been fury from unions after ITV News saw contracts, known as Seafarer's Employment Agreements, showing agency workers on one of the company's Dover ferries being paid a basic wage of $860 (PS683) a month for a 40 hour working week - an hourly rate of pay of PS3.94. The contract sets out additional rates for overtime, leave and a subsistence allowance, which P&O insists rises the rate of pay to PS5.10 an hour, based on an 84-hour working week. Chief executive Peter Hebblethwaite - who is paid some PS325,000 a year - told MPs the lowest hourly rate agency crews would earn would be PS5.15, when he appeared before a joint select committee hearing last month. Frances O'Grady of the Trades Union Congress told ITV: 'Make no mistake - these are sweatshop conditions. P&O has deliberately sacked experienced, unionised staff so that it can replace them with agency workers on poverty pay. 'These 'union-busting' tactics should worry all of us. If companies are allowed to get away with acting like corporate gangsters no worker is safe.' A P&O spokesman said: 'It is misleading to assert that any agency seafarer is paid PS3.94 an hour.  Everyone working on the ship is contractually entitled to receive a basic salary plus guaranteed overtime, a leave allowance, a subsistence allowance and a bonus.  'Taken together, the minimum rate of hourly pay is the equivalent of PS5.58 an hour and nobody working on board our ships is paid less. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps declared it is 'completely unsustainable' that P&O Ferries chief executive Peter Hebblethwaite remains in his job after sacking 800 seafarers without notice. Mr Shapps told the Commons' Transport Select Committee 'he will have to go' and also urged the Dubai-owned company Hebblethwaite works for to repay PS11 million of furlough money. The Tory minister also insisted 'they will have to pay the minimum wage' to crews. The drama in the Irish Sea was yet another public relations disaster for the scandal-hit firm - just weeks after it sparked fury by firing 800 UK staff over zoom and replacing them with cheaper foreign crews.  Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng announced earlier this month that the Insolvency Service had started 'formal criminal and civil investigations' into the company, which he said he would be 'following closely' along with Mr Grant Shapps. 'It is important to note that the rates paid to our agency seafarers are above the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) minimum standards. We fully welcome the Government's commitment to increasing the minimum wage for all seafarers working in British waters and have called for a level playing field when it comes to pay and conditions on British ferry routes.' The Rail, Maritime and Transport union attributed the European Causeway crisis to the vessel having 'inexperienced crew', as seafarers 'familiar with the ship would have been able to keep it under power'.  RMT boss Darren Procter said crew on board the European Causeway had claimed that engine parts were changed with the firm's European Highlander 'in order to pass its inspection', the Telegraph reported. It was yet another public relations disaster for the scandal-hit firm - just weeks after it sparked fury by firing 800 UK staff over zoom and replacing them with cheaper foreign crews.  Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng announced earlier this month that the Insolvency Service had started 'formal criminal and civil investigations' into the company, which he said he would be 'following closely' along with Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. It comes as Mr Shapps repeated his calls for P&O Ferries' Mr Hebblethwaite to resign. The Transport Secretary said Mr Hebblethwaite's position was 'completely unsustainable', adding: 'He will have to go.'  He also called on P&O Ferries to pay back the PS11million it took in taxpayer-funded furlough money. Appearing before the Commons transport committee on Wednesday, Mr Shapps said: 'There are three things that P&O will need to do to get out of this mess and I call upon them today publicly to get on and do it. 'First of all, it's completely unsustainable to have the head of P&O, the boss Peter Hebblethwaite, who came to a committee room like this and openly and deliberately explained how he sought to break the law, he actually said that was his intention and that he would do it again... He will have to go. 'Secondly, in my view, though it's a matter for P&O themselves, I think that they need to repay furlough money as well. 'It's around PS11million. I don't think it's right that having claimed that money they then sacked the workers in such a premeditated way, which they themselves admitted broke the law. 'Thirdly, they will have to pay the minimum wage [under new laws being introduced in May].' Mr Shapps said that he was working with opposite numbers in Paris and Dublin to establish 'corridors' that do not allow ferry crew to be paid less than the national minimum wage. The new laws he is introducing will only require the UK minimum wage to be paid in British waters. P&O Ferries pays its new crew an average of PS5.50 per hour, which it has insisted is in line with international maritime laws. Mr Shapps announced yesterday that legislation forcing ferry operators using UK ports to pay seafarers at least the national minimum wage of PS9.50 per hour will be included in the Queen's Speech on May 10. P&O Ferries said it would 'fully welcome' measures to increase pay for all seafarers in British waters as it wants 'a level playing field'. Irish Ferries, which also uses a low-cost labour model, began competing with the firm on the Dover to Calais route in June 2021.",

  "a0facc74fc464efacb8e8e1c020ffe0f7eb7c86add6cd54ba72d6595": "A picture has come to light of Liberal election candidate Katherine Deves in a skimpy dress at Sydney's Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras - after she took to the airwaves to claim she's not anti-trans.   Prime Minister Scott Morrison's 'captain's pick' for the Sydney northern beaches seat of Warringah told Ben Fordham on 2GB on Friday that Australians were in her corner when it came to trans women participating in female sports.  The Federal election campaign has been roiled by a series of incendiary tweets Ms Deves once shared describing trans children as 'sterilised' and 'mutilated'.  However one unearthed tweet, now deleted, paints a different picture - featuring an image of Ms Deves rocking out with a friend at Mardi Gras in the 1990s. 'Back in the 90s, when Sydney Mardi Gras was still a grassroots street parade with a killer party at Hordern celebrating the progress of gay and lesbian rights,' she wrote in the tweet, seen by Daily Mail Australia.  It comes as Ms Deves revealed why she got involved in the issue of trans people in sports as she has three little girls who play different sports. 'I saw that little girls and young women should have someone standing up representing their interests and all I ever wanted was for this debate to be held in the public domain. Fordham asked Ms Deves directly whether she was transphobic. 'Oh of course not, Ben,' she responded.  'This isn't about (transphobia), this argument is about women and girls.  'Back in the early 1990s I was going to Mardi Gras, I voted for same-sex marriage, I don't have an issue with that but this is about a collision of rights and we just need to be able to debate it in a respectful way.' Ms Deves also said she could still win Warringah.  'I wouldn't have stood up if I didn't believe I had a chance to win,' she said.   In the wake of Ms Deves' comments, there have been multiple calls for Ms Deves to be disendorsed, including by prominent Liberals North Sydney MP Trent Zimmerman and NSW Treasurer Matt Kean. Ms Deves faces an uphill battle to reclaim Warringah for the Liberals, with the former blue-ribbon seat currently held by independent MP Zali Steggall by more than seven per cent. Ms Steggall was $1.04 favourite to win the seat while Ms Deves is at $9, according to the most recent Sportsbet odds.  Ms Deves has become a divisive figure following a number of provocative comments on her Twitter account - which she has since deleted. She once declared trans teenagers are 'surgically mutilated' and felt personally 'triggered' by the rainbow Pride flag. The Warringah candidate also bizarrely linked cross-dressing males and and trans women to 'sexual predators, even serial killers'. 'Transvestism is very common among sexual predators, even serial killers,' she said in a historical tweet. 'So how are we women supposed to tell the difference between the ones who are a threat and the ones who aren't? Easier for women to exclude all males from spaces where we are vulnerable.' Last September Ms Deves described the prospect of two gay men having a baby as a 'vanity project.' 'Surrogacy is a human rights violation,' she tweeted. 'Women's bodies are not vehicles for a vanity project.' Ms Deves was referring to Pete Buttigieg, the first openly gay U.S. presidential candidate, and his husband, who are joint fathers of twin girls. In another tweet, Ms Deves said 'transablism' - where trans people pretend to be disabled - is 'a thing' and likened people in that category to a well-known serial killer. Mr Morrison subsequently defended her as the party's candidate as she received a torrent of online abuse over the comments. 'She is standing up for women and girls and their access to fair sport in this country,' the PM said. 'She has learned in her advocacy in her private life there are better ways to do things to take things forward as a Member of Parliament. 'I believe that is how she will approach the task if she is elected as the member for Warringah, and I don't think she should be silenced.'",
  "f1bfe7ebf39d3688396a1091cd9f4f88c0e16dde014b4162f940dd34": "The man who killed four children walking together to an ice cream shop is appealing his prison sentence on the grounds it 'is manifestly excessive' and he had ADHD while driving drunk and on drugs. Samuel William Davidson was driving erratically and speeding when he struck Veronique Sakr, 11, and her cousins, Sienna Abdallah, eight, and her siblings Angelina, 12, and Antony, 13. The children had been walking to buy ice-creams when the 31-year-old ploughed into them after his ute mounted a kerb on Bettington Rd, at Oatlands, in Sydney's northwest on February 1 in 2020. Davdison was sentenced last year to a maximum 28-year prison sentence with a minimum 21 year sentence which does not expire until 2041. In his bid to have the prison sentence slashes, which will be heard on Monday in the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, Davidson will argued that the term is 'manifestly excessive'. The second ground listed for his appeal is that the sentencing judge made an 'error in holding  no causal link between ADHD and commission of offences'.  The appeal is listed before Justices Paul Brereton, Christine Adamson and Natalie Adams.  Davidson is two-and-a-half years into his sentence and is not expected to be eligible for parole until 2041.  Both the Abdullah children's parents Danny and Leila and Sakr families have shown remarkable grace in the wake of the horrific incident, with Danny saying said he forgave Davidson 'for your sake, for my sake, and most importantly for my family's sake'. But he also said at the time of Davidson's sentencing that it did not matter whether he received one year or 100 years, 'we won't get Antony, Angelina, Sienna and Veronique back'.  'We will all have our hearts broken until the day we take our last breath and no sentence can help ease that pain.'  One bright spot in the lives of the Abdallahs was in March this year when Danny and Leila welcomed a new baby girl, who they called Selina because it echoed the names of Sienna and Angelina.  In sentencing Davidson at Parramatta's District Court in April, Judge James Bennett said Davidson's menacing, dangerous and aggressive driving over a significant period leading up to the tragic event showed all responsibility to the road safety of others was abandoned.  The tragedy was inevitable, but the magnitude of the tragedy extended to the unimaginable, Judge Bennett said.  The professional truck driver was afforded a 25 per cent discount on sentence after pleading guilty to manslaughter for the children he killed and also pleading guilty to three charges relating to the injuries caused to three other children.  One boy has suffered permanent brain damage.    Davidson, the son of a former policeman, had been sitting poolside with his housemates drinking Vodka Cruisers and beers, having his first drink about 7am before consuming drugs and driving on February 1, 2020. He was observed by witnesses speeding through a red light, swerving anti-clockwise around a round-about, and driving at a maximum speed of 133km/h in a 50km/h zone. After the crash, Davidson appeared distressed and was heard saying: 'What have I done? ... I have killed people ... I am going to jail.'   Judge Bennett acknowledged Davidson suffered from ADHD but did not accept impulsivity that day caused him to drive, seen in his consciousness of guilt immediately after the crash. After Davidson's sentencing, Mr Abdallah said his main disappointment lay in Australian culture's love of drugs and alcohol.  'That's where my frustration is, more than the driver.'  Judge Bennett acknowledged Davidson suffered from ADHD but did not accept impulsivity that day caused him to drive, seen in his consciousness of guilt immediately after the crash. Davidson's letter of apology stated that he is heartbroken to have hurt such beautiful families by his horrid actions and that he would do anything to relive that day sober and never leaving the house.

  "46a7a59315e48b7b93ce25383d6da750cda7722356e795700e5c106b": "The red flatbed trucks began arriving after dawn, men in white hazmat suits unloading sections of green metal caging. Residents peered nervously from windows of tall apartment blocks, as the figures below erected the fencing across the entrances to their skyscrapers, caging them into their homes. This is the Pudong district of Shanghai, deemed a high-risk Covid area in need of what the city authorities call 'hard isolation', and where residents say they are being treated like animals. 'Could we also put fences around the homes of Shanghai leaders?' asked one, as their photos and videos coursed through Chinese social media, pursued by the Communist Party's ever-zealous censors. The story is the same in the rest of Shanghai's districts. One video shows more hazmat-suited workers drilling the doors shut at a restaurant in the city to prevent those inside from leaving. Two elderly men look out in disbelief. Elsewhere, more men-in-white beat a group of residents demanding food, lashing out viciously with long sticks. Phone cameras caught still more PPE-wearing thugs slapping and shoving boys and girls into a van to be taken to one of the city's 100 compulsory quarantine centres that await all those testing positive. Sometimes the scenes have bordered on the surreal. One video posted on Monday showed young children arriving at school clad in all-encompassing white hazmat suits of their own. They lumbered through the school gate in unwieldy fashion, like tiny Michelin Men, waving awkwardly at the camera. This is the face of China's extraordinary -- and barbaric -- zero-Covid policy. For many of Shanghai's residents, the draconian lockdown has lasted more than three weeks. Countless numbers have been confined to their homes, under strict government instruction to isolate even if they don't have the virus. Neighbourhoods are divided into three categories based on the risk of transmission. Those in the first category endure the strictest Covid-19 controls and have just been hit with heightened measures. The 2 m-high green fences now block entrances to residential housing in many of these areas. It appears they are designed to stop those living inside a complex that has a reported Covid case from leaving their homes -- whether or not they have the virus. Under China's unbending controls, anyone over the age of seven who tests positive -- even if they are asymptomatic or have a mild infection -- must be isolated in centralised quarantine facilities. Despite evidence that the Omicron variant is less deadly than the original strain, China persists in its leader Xi Jinping's determination to eradicate the virus completely -- a policy that is now devastating its economy, and has even prompted Western stock markets to tumble. While the focus has been on Shanghai, which has so far recorded 400,000 cases and 138 deaths, all but 13 of China's richest 100 cities have imposed some form of quarantine restriction, and the intensity is increasing. The capital, Beijing, has launched mass testing for some 3.5 million people who live and work in the city's biggest district of Chaoyang, after 26 cases were reported over the weekend. Schools and gyms are closing down, while vegetables, toilet paper and instant noodles are sold out in the city's supermarkets as people stockpile, fearful of a lockdown as harsh as Shanghai's. That city's outbreak is China's worst since Wuhan, and it has been like a virtual ghost town since going into lockdown in early April. Chinese social media has exploded with anger in a way not seen since the early days of the pandemic in Wuhan, with censors struggling to eliminate the criticism. At nightfall, Shanghai's districts echo with the sound of pots and pans being banged in protest. This time, the concern is not predominantly with the virus itself, but with food shortages. Those allowed to visit supermarkets have reported empty shelves. For those unable to leave their homes, commercial food services and government-provided packages are unreliable. People have reported waking up in the early hours of the morning to order supplies online, only to be told that deliveries have already been suspended for the day. Since Shanghai's tap water is not drinkable, deliveries of bottled water are vital. The food scarcity has even driven some to forage roadside plants -- leading to reported cases of food poisoning. There have been harrowing online pleas for help with medicine and food as a video emerged of residents of a high-rise apartment yelling from their windows: 'We're starving.' Another showed people fighting over food. One flashpoint has been the conditions in Shanghai's mandated quarantine centres. From these facilities have emerged reports of overflowing lavatories, cold showers and little privacy. In one, 4,000 people were living in cubicles next to each other in a vast exhibition hall, with no showers. There was a national outcry over a video showing crying children separated from their parents and crammed into metal-barred beds. Elsewhere, a man who had lost the will to live threatened to throw himself off the indoor balcony of one crowded quarantine facility. Meanwhile, thousands of Chinese social media users unable to leave their apartments have shared stories of people with life-threatening illnesses who have been unable to get treatment. Trucks bringing supplies into the city have their cab doors sealed, to prevent the driver getting out. Plastic buckets are handed to them through the windows should they need the toilet. A harrowing six-minute video, entitled Voices Of April, contains audio snippets of anger and grief as a drone-camera slowly moves over the city. The snippets include the cries of babies separated from their parents in quarantine, pleas for food and urgent medical care -- as well as the cold indifference of officials. It went viral, but censors eventually deleted it. Other social media mocked the authorities by posting images from the movie Night Of The Living Dead, suggesting China's business capital of 25 million people was experiencing its own zombie apocalypse. That analogy seemed all the more fitting on Monday as the city was lashed with heavy rain and winds, sending litter bins flying across the empty roads. Despite the clamours for relaxing lockdown measures, President Xi insists: 'Prevention and control work cannot be relaxed' and 'Persistence is victory'. Many Chinese epidemiologists regard that as lunacy, but it is Xi's lunacy and in today's China, the 'emperor' cannot be questioned. Complete 'victory' over the virus has become a key part of the cult of Xi. It underpins the Communist Party's triumphalism and Xi's boasts of China being superior to the bungling West. In the parallel world of official propaganda, China's state-owned media insists there is 'faith in zero-Covid policy' and 'Residents' lives made easier'. Such claims are widely ridiculed. It is hard to think of any other country, even among autocracies, that could impose China's combination of claustrophobic surveillance and casual brutality towards those who disobey the party. The surveillance has reached new extremes, including the deployment of robots and drones to herd Shanghai's desperate population. The robots include a dog called Preserved Egg (named after a famous Chinese dish), about the size of a terrier. It roams Shanghai's deserted streets and apartment corridors barking orders to stay inside and rousing residents when it is their turn to come downstairs for yet another round of compulsory testing. On Monday, there was a revolt at the city's famous Fudan University, which has been festooned with cameras to enforce lockdown rules. 'It's a university, not a concentration camp' . . . 'Against surveillance! Against bureaucracy! Against micro-fascism' were just some of the banners that went up on campus (and spread on social media) after more white suits were photographed installing cameras outside the female toilet. Shanghai's stock exchange saw its biggest fall in two years on Monday, tumbling by more than 5 per cent. That was partly out of the fear that Beijing may soon follow Shanghai into lockdown. The economic cost of endless and severe lockdowns is undeniable. Even Li Keqiang, China's premier and the man nominally in charge of economic affairs is sounding increasingly rattled, talking about the 'greater uncertainties and challenges' ahead. China has been spooked by the way Covid-19 has swept through Hong Kong, where death rates reached the highest in the world. Like in Hong Kong, vaccination rates among the elderly are low in China -- only half the over-80s are fully vaccinated and just a fifth are boosted. Add to that the lower efficacy rate of Chinese vaccines and China is highly vulnerable, even though the fast spreading Omicron variant is less deadly. The Communist Party is becoming increasingly prickly, and as always is on the search for foreign conspirators to blame. Officials have accused the U.S. of 'weaponising' the crisis, after the State Department ordered non-emergency staff to leave its Shanghai consulate -- a move that was motivated more by China's measures to control the virus than by the virus itself. The U.S. announcement cited the risks of parents and children being separated -- the forceable removal of Covid-positive children to quarantine has been one of the most controversial of Shanghai's lockdown practices. One widely-shared social media post asked, not unreasonably, whether the zero-Covid policy was not causing far more harm than the virus itself. The post was deleted. Ultimately, zero-Covid is a political strategy -- Xi Jinping's talisman. Too much is at stake for him, especially this year, when he is expected to be anointed by the party as leader for life. Xi has boxed himself into a corner. He is playing a large, expensive and increasingly futile game of Whac-A-Mole. It is hard to see how zero-Covid can be sustained. It is under strain as never before, and it is in Shanghai that its future is likely to be determined. Ian Williams is author of Every Breath You Take: China's New Tyranny, published by Birlinn.",
  "dd46e9ccf6d11b60d430fa18ef49467ccb00ba97894c98b250bb402b": "Three-time Wimbledon champion Boris Becker could be sent to jail today as he faces sentence for flouting the terms of his 2017 bankruptcy. The former world number one, 54, was earlier this month found guilty of transferring hundreds of thousands of pounds from his business account and failing to declare a property in his home town of Leimen, Germany. BBC commentator Becker was also convicted of hiding an 825,000 euro (almost PS700,000) bank loan and 75,000 shares in a tech firm. Each offence under the Insolvency Act, which include removal of property, two counts of failing to disclose estate and concealing debt, carries a maximum sentence of seven years imprisonment. Judge Deborah Taylor will sentence six-time Grand Slam champion Becker, who has a previous conviction for tax evasion and attempted tax evasion in Germany in 2002, at Southwark Crown Court from midday today. Becker was yesterday spotted visiting Harrods, a Notting Hill council estate and seeing his son, looking haggard as he walked alone through areas of London wearing a grey jacket, jeans, trainers and a baseball cap.  He was seen going into a side entrance of the Harrods department store in Knightsbridge, while he was also photographed in the Paddington and Notting Hill areas. At around 11am, he visited a flat in Notting Hill, where a woman answered the door and embraced him. He later left the flat at 12.45pm. It is unclear who Becker was visiting at the council estate.   The former tennis star was also seen meeting with his son ahead of his sentencing.   He had jurors his $50million (about PS38 million) career earnings were swallowed up by an expensive divorce to his first wife Barbara Becker, child maintenance payments and 'expensive lifestyle commitments'. The German national, who has lived in the UK since 2012, said he was 'shocked' and 'embarrassed' when he was declared bankrupt on June 21 2017 over an unpaid loan of more than PS3 million on his estate in Mallorca, Spain. He claimed he had co-operated with trustees tasked with securing his assets, even offering up his wedding ring, and relied on the advisers who managed his life. However, Becker, who was supported in court by his partner Lilian de Carvalho Monteiro and eldest son Noah, was found guilty of four charges. The court heard Becker received 1.13 million euros (about PS950,000) from the sale of a Mercedes car dealership he owned in Germany, which was paid into a business account used as a 'piggy bank' for his personal expenses. Becker was found guilty of transferring 427,00 euros (PS356,000) to nine recipients, including the accounts of his ex-wife Barbara and estranged wife Sharlely 'Lilly' Becker, the mother of his fourth child. He was further convicted of failing to declare a property in his home town of Leimen, hiding an 825,000 euro (almost PS700,000) bank loan on the house as well as 75,000 shares in tech firm Breaking Data Corp.  Earlier this week Becker, who won tennis fans' hearts in the 1980s with his all-action style of play, was embraced by his girlfriend as he smoked during a break in a meeting with documentary maker George Chignell in London. Last weekend, he was pictured with Lilly and their 12-year-old boy in south London before the father and son met up with his current girlfriend.  Becker's mother Elvira Becker, 86, has begged a judge not to send her son to jail, saying earlier this month that he is 'a decent boy overall', adding: 'I hope my son doesn't have to go to prison.'  The German national, who has lived in the UK since 2012, claimed he had co-operated with trustees tasked with securing his assets, even offering up his wedding ring, and relied on the advisers who managed his life. However, Becker, who was supported in court by his partner Ms de Carvalho Monteiro and eldest son, was found guilty of four charges under the Insolvency Act by a jury at Southwark Crown Court on April 8. They include removal of property, two counts of failing to disclose estate and concealing debt. Judge Deborah Taylor released Becker on conditional bail ahead of sentencing today. The jury heard Becker received PS950,000 from the sale of a Mercedes car dealership he owned in Germany, which was paid into a business account. Prosecutor Rebecca Chalkley said he used the account as a 'piggy bank' for personal expenses, including PS7,600 on children's school fees, almost PS1,000 at Harrods, and payments made to Ralph Lauren, Porsche, Ocado and a Chelsea children's club. He was found guilty of transferring PS356,000 to nine recipients, including the accounts of his ex-wife Barbara and estranged wife Sharlely 'Lilly' Becker, the mother of his fourth child. Becker also paid PS40,000 for an ankle operation at a private clinic and spent PS5,000 at a luxury golf resort in China, the court heard. He was convicted of failing to declare a property in his home town of Leimen, hiding an PS700,000 bank loan on the house as well as 75,000 shares in tech firm Breaking Data Corp. But Becker was acquitted of a further 20 charges, including nine counts of failing to hand over trophies and medals from his tennis career. He told jurors he did not know the whereabouts of the memorabilia, including two of his three Wimbledon men's singles trophies, including the 1985 title that catapulted him to stardom, aged 17. The other prizes were his 1992 Olympic gold medal, Australian Open trophies from 1991 and 1996, the President's Cup from 1985 and 1989, his 1989 Davis Cup trophy and a Davis Cup gold coin which he won in 1988. Becker was cleared of failing to declare a second German property, as well as his interest in the PS2.5 million Chelsea flat occupied by his daughter Anna Ermakova, who was conceived during Becker's infamous sexual encounter with waitress Angela Ermakova at London restaurant Nobu in 1999. Giving evidence, he said he earned a 'vast amount' of money during his career, paying cash for a family home in Munich, a property in Miami, Florida, and the estate in Mallorca, which was worth about 50 million euros at the height of the property market. But Becker, who went on to coach current world number one tennis player Novak Djokovic, work as a TV sports commentator and act as a brand ambassador for firms including Puma, said his income 'reduced dramatically' following his retirement in 1999. He said he was involved in an 'expensive divorce' with ex-wife Barbara in 2001, involving high maintenance payments to their two sons, and had to support his daughter Anna and her mother, in a deal which included the Chelsea flat. Becker, who was resident in Monte Carlo and Switzerland before moving to the UK, said he had 'expensive lifestyle commitments,' including his PS22,000-a-month rented house in Wimbledon, south-west London. He also owed the Swiss authorities five million francs (about PS4 million) and separately just under one million euros (more than PS800,000) in liabilities over a conviction for tax evasion and attempted tax evasion in Germany in 2002. The court heard Becker's bankruptcy resulted from a PS3.85 million loan from private bank Arbuthnot Latham in 2013, and PS1.2million, with a 25 per cent interest rate, borrowed from British businessman John Caudwell, who founded Phones 4u, the following year. He said bad publicity had damaged 'brand Becker', meaning he struggled to make enough money to pay off his debts, while his QC Jonathan Laidlaw said at the time of his bankruptcy Becker was too 'trusting and reliant' on his advisers. Few spots stars have ever hit the height of Boris Becker's tennis careers - and none as young as the German ace. Born in Leimen, West Germany, in 1967, Becker, the son of an architect father and a Czech immigrant mother, was thrust into the world of tennis from a young age. His father founded a tennis centre in the town, where Becker honed his skills early on. By the age of 10, in 1977, he was a member of the junior team of the Baden Tennis Association. He went on to win the South German championship and the first German Youth Tennis Tournament.  After winning funding for training from the German Tennis Federation, he turned professional at 16 in 1984, winning the Tennis World Young Masters at the NEC in Birmingham in 1985, before claiming victory at Queens in June. Two weeks later, in July, aged 17, he entered Wimbledon as an unseeded player and took the tournament by storm, beating Kevin Curren by four sets in the final.  At just 17 years and 228 days old he became the youngest men's singles champion at SW19 - and immediately became a household name. The following year he defend his title, beating then world number one Ivan Lendl to secure back-to-back Wimbledon titles. He appeared in 77 finals and won 49 singles titles during his 16 years as a tennis pro. But by 1993, facing criticism over his marriage to wife Barbara and tax problems with the German government, had caused Becker to slide into a severe mid-career decline. In 1997, Becker lost to Sampras in the quarterfinals at Wimbledon. After that match, he vowed that he would never play at Wimbledon again. However he returned one more time to the prestigious west London tennis club, in 1999, this time losing in the fourth round to Patrick Rafter. Off the court, his personal troubles continued. He had to pay PS2.4million after he fathered a daughter, named Anna, with a Russian model while married to wife Barbara. That incident took place after he crashed out of Wimbledon to Rafter in 1999 and decided to retire from the sport, aged 31. Becker, in his 2003 autobiography, Stay A Moment Longer, revealed how he 'cried my eyes out' and felt the need to go out for a few beers with friends. However his then wife Barbara, seven months' pregnant with their second son, wanted him to stay at their hotel with her.  'She couldn't and wouldn't understand that she suddenly wasn't first in my priorities,' said Becker.  'I said, 'Just once more with the lads, Barbara, just once more to say farewell and then it's only you'. That didn't work. We rowed for two whole hours. Suddenly she was in pain and decided to check into hospital.; Becker said he told his wife to call him if the baby was really on the way, then hit the town. By 11pm he was at the bar in Mayfair's Nobu and spotted Russian model Angela Ermakowa. The pair had sex on the staircase in the London outpost.  The following February his secretary handed him a fax in his Munich office. It read: 'Dear Herr Becker, We met in Nobu in London. The result of that meeting is now eight months old.'  He later split from his first wife Barbara Feltus, a divorce which is estimated to have cost him more than PS15million, as well as their home in Miami.  Becker found a new post-tennis purpose soon after, joining the BBC for its annual coverage of Wimbledon - to great success. But his personal problems continued. He had a short engagement to Alessandra Meyer-Wolden in 2008, before announcing that he and Dutch model Sharlely 'Lilly' Kerssenberg would marry in 2009. After nine years of marriage, and a child, Becker's fourth, the pair split in 2018.  A year earlier, Becker had been declared bankrupt in June 2017 over an unpaid loan of more than PS3million on his estate in Mallorca, Spain. His former business partner, Hans-Dieter Cleven, also claimed that the former tennis ace owed him more than PS30million - though the case that was rejected by a Swiss court. Now Becker faces another bump in the road - perhaps the most serious yet - after being found guilty of four counts relating to the Insolvency Act earlier this month. He faces up to seven years in prison - with his freedom now left hanging in the balance ahead of his sentencing tomorrow.",

Mr Weimar, who became an unlikely sex symbol as he presided over Victoria's day-to-day handling of Covid, is expected to be announced as the CEO of the organising committee for the 2026 Commonwealth Games in the state. The $500,000-a-year appointment is set to be announced as early as next week, the Herald-Sun reports.  But not everyone is enthusiastic about the news, with the paper reporting some sporting figures feel Mr Weimar's role in shutting down sport in Victoria for two years makes him unsuitable for the role.    'He, alongside Brett Sutton and Daniel Andrews, lectured us for two years and tried to kill off sport in this state,' a 'sporting insider' was quoted as saying. 'I'm not sure sport wants him anywhere near the Games. Especially when you look at him, and his experience.' Another source characterised the appointment as a 'reward' for Mr Weimar's role in policing the stringent public health measures introduced by Victoria during the pandemic, and wondered whether his renowned logistics expertise would overcome the fact he was 'starting from a long way behind'. Mr Weimar announced he would quit his Covid commander post last week as  Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews continued to wind back the state's pandemic measures, including mandatory masks and vaccinated economy rules.  He had been responsible for the coordination of the state's testing, tracing and vaccination schemes .  Mr Weimar had been in the Covid coordination role since July 2020, after the state's hotel quarantine debacle, and said he would take time off before returning to the public service later in the year. Upon his appointment, Mr Weimar and Victoria's top doctor, Brett Sutton, were hailed as 'sex symbols' by some quarters of the population.  His resignation from the role came after announcements the bulk of pandemic rules in Australia's two biggest states' would be scrapped, including abolishing close-contact isolation requirements.  Victoria was only announced as the venue for the games in early April. The state will host a 'decentralised' event with regional hubs including Geelong, Bendigo, Ballarat and Gippsland among the venues for 16 sports.  'This will be a Commonwealth Games like no other. We promised we wouldn't be doing a re-run of 2006, as successful as that was,' Premier Daniel Andrews said at the time of the announcement.  'This is also about creating jobs, some nearly 4,000 jobs during the Commonwealth Games and some 3,000 enduring jobs thereafter.'  The 2026 games will mark the sixth time the event has been held in Australia following the games in Sydney, 1938, Perth in 1962, Brisbane in 1982, Melbourne in 2006, and the Gold Coast in 2018. ",
  "5441d80300a481fd48e8dd737b42eaa7cd1d8034f283d4f01a0ac325": "One of Hollywood's most powerful men last night publicly admonished the actor Will Smith for his infamous 'Oscars slap' sending the clearest signal yet that the disgraced superstar's career could be over. Speaking at the Simon Wiesenthal Center's national tribute dinner, Jeffrey Katzenberg - former head of Walt Disney Studios and the founder of DreamWorks Studios - told a crowd of 700 Tinseltown heavyweights: 'Unfortunately intolerance continues to be on the rise no matter where we look.  'We see it vividly on display whether it be far off on the battlefields of Ukraine or right here in Hollywood on the stage of the Dolby Theatre (home of the Oscars).' Men In Black star Smith stormed onto the stage at the Dolby during last month's Oscars ceremony and slapped Chris Rock after the comedian joked about Jada Pinkett Smith's hair. An enraged Smith screamed 'keep my wife's name out of your f****** mouth'. It later emerged Jada suffers from the hair loss condition alopecia. Smith, who won the Best Actor Oscar moments after his outburst for 'King Richard', was later banned from the Oscars for ten years and several of his film projects have been delayed or cancelled as his career hangs in the balance. Last night an executive with a major Hollywood studio told MailOnline: 'Jeffrey Katzenberg is one of the most powerful and revered men in Hollywood. For him to publicly condemn Will Smith at such a prestigious event is a big deal. It means Hollywood isn't ready to forgive or forget. It definitely sends the signal that Smith's career is on life-support.' A smiling Smith was photographed last weekend in India where he is believed to be staying at an ashram run by a spiritual guru who teaches 'self-transformation.' Thursday night's gala - the first major Hollywood event since the Oscars - was attended by a host of stars including James Corden, Will.i.Am, LL Cool J and Maroon 5's Adam Levine and virtually every Hollywood studio head. The Simon Wiesenthal Center is named after the famous Nazi hunter and is one of the most revered and prestigious human rights organizations in the world. Co-chairs of the event included Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones, producers Jerry Bruckheimer (Pirates of the Caribbean) and Ron Howard (The Da Vinci Code) and JJ Abrams (who directed the last three Star Wars movies.) A source said: 'The Wiesenthal event is attended by those who hold the power in Hollywood; studio bosses, producers, all the big agents. The feeling in the room was very much that Smith's career won't recover.' The gala raised $3.7 million for the Museum of Tolerance which commemorates victims of the Holocaust. Ukrainian President Zelensky was awarded the Center's Medal of Freedom. Apple's senior vice president of services Eddy Cue was given the organization's highest honor, the Humanitarian Award. Late-night talk show host James Corden, who was master of ceremonies, joked about being picked to host the event saying: 'Of course it makes sense for me to be here because it's almost impossible to find a Jewish comedian in Hollywood. Naturally one of the world's most prominent Jewish organizations has turned to me, a lapsed Protestant from High Wycombe.' He also took a jibe at Smith saying: 'Everyone is so happy that we are back being able to meet in person together again - except maybe Chris Rock.' Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder and CEO of the Simon Wiesenthal Center (SWC), said if Wiesenthal, who survived concentration camps and devoted his life to tracking down Nazis, was alive today (he died in 2005) 'He would be shocked that England, the country that led the charge against Hitler, just released findings that at least three anti-Semitic crimes are committed in the country every single day, forcing Jewish-owned bakeries and restaurants to close their stores on Holocaust Memorial Day for fear of being targeted.  As Winston Churchill reminded us: 'Strength is granted to us when we are needed to serve great causes. This is such a time. Let us act!'",
  "9323dce4453842d6121a0db8c344f11124eb381561d3df3cdd8e2846": "Miami Heat player Jimmy Butler was hit with a $15,000 fine for gyrating his hips from the sidelines of a game - with the NBA fining his team the same amount for turning the moment into a meme. The NBA cited Butler's 'obscene gesture' as offensive and hit the forward with a hefty fine after Game 5 in the Eastern Conference Wednesday.  Butler was seen on the sidelines next to teammate Max Strus celebrating the Heat's 10-0 streak by suggestively thrusting his hips back and force. He did so while curling his lip at the camera, with less than two minutes to go in the second quarter.  The team itself also got slapped with a $15,000 for making the clip into a GIF - a short animate image. The team's account has since deleted the post, but the footage is still circling social media.  Butler, who was dressed in all black, did not participate in the game due to a knee injury, but watched from the bench as the team won 97-94 against the Atlanta Hawks at the FTX Arena on Thursday.  This is the player's third fine this season, bringing his total loss to $70,000, according to NBC Miami.   In November, he was fined $30,000 during a Denver-Miami game for allegedly trying to escalate an altercation. He also got a $25,000 fine in February for violating media interview access rules, according to NBC Miami.  NBA legend LeBron James was also fined $15,000 for an 'obscene gesture' in November after he did what has been dubbed the 'big balls' dance, where a man hops back and forth on their feet and gesture toward their private area. 'Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James has been fined $15,000 for making an obscene gesture on the playing court and warned for using profane language during media availability in response to league imposed discipline,' the NBA wrote at the time.  The Miami Heat will play again on Monday in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals. ",
  "58aef159ae0517a8a0a4996e99be875c56364fd9072bd7befd6d695f": "Johnny Depp's bodyguard has described noticing injuries and marks on the actor's face as his marriage to Amber Heard got increasingly more volatile.    Malcolm Connolly took the stand in the Hollywood star's defamation trial against his ex-wife Thursday, telling the court he witnessed his client go from being happy in love to 'quiet' as Heard became more 'dominant' and 'demanding.'   Testifying remotely from his native UK, Connolly, who began working as Depp's private personal security in 2006, said: 'At the beginning [it was] all lovey-dovey. Everything was great. Honeymoon period was on, and yeah it was good.' 'It was great to see Johnny happy again. Amber was lovely, charming - as she usually is - and good as gold.'  But Connolly, who identifies as a 'protection officer', said things then 'started to change' between the two spouses, who began arguing more often.  'Amber started to change. Amber started getting a bit more feisty, demanding. I could see that Amber wanted to wear the pants in this relationship. That was pretty obvious,' he said.  The bodyguard added that Heard 'could get a frosty at the drop of hat' and over time witnessed Depp 'getting quieter' as Amber 'started getting grumpy.' Connolly admitted that he never did see any physical violence between the two, but testified that he would often hear Depp and Heard argue frequently.    'I could hear Amber screaming. I could hearing shouting and bawling,' he said, adding that he could 'mostly' hear Heard shouting and that the couple fought 'more often than not.'  And while he never witnessed any violence, the security guard told the court that he began noticing scratches and injuries on Depp's face. He noted that he never saw any marks on Heard.   'What I noticed straight away was most of these marks were happening on the left hand side of his (Depp's) face,' Connolly said.  'There would be scratches on his neck. Maybe a fat lip in the corner, a bruising in the eye socket.  'It was getting more regular. Not every week, but it was definitely happening,' he added.   The jury was then shown a photo taken by Connolly during Depp and Heard's honeymoon in 2013.   Depp, posing alongside his now ex-wife and three others, appeared to have visible injuries and 'swelling' on his face.  When asked to described the photo, Connolly pointed the 'swelling on the left hand side' of Depp's nose and 'under his left eye.' Asked what he thought had happened, the bodyguard said: 'Either he's walked into a door, or a door has walked into him,' prompting laughter from the courtroom.  Earlier on Thursday, jurors also heard briefly from Depp's business manager, Ed White, who said he intervened in 2016 to resolve financial difficulties for Depp, including unpaid taxes and a cash crunch.  When he blamed Heard for an excessive wine bill that featured multiple $500 bottles of Spanish Vega Sicilia wine, Heard's lawyers responded with a barrage of questions over Depp's spending excesses, including spending millions of dollars to shoot journalist Hunter S. Thompson's ashes out of a cannon.   The court also heard testimony revealing that Elon Musk covered nearly half of ex-girlfriend Amber Heard's donation to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) after she pledged to give away her multimillion dollar divorce settlement to charity following her split from Depp.  The actress has so far only paid $1.3million of the $3.5million she promised the ACLU nearly six years ago, with Musk's money making up a large chunk of it. The billionaire Tesla founder, 50, gave $500,000 to the civil rights group on behalf of Heard after the two began dating after her divorce from Depp in 2016.  The Aquaman star, 36, announced she would donate the $7million she received in her settlement to two organizations when the couple's legal separation was finalized in August 2016. Heard promised to give half the money to the ACLU to support its work in 'fighting violence against women', and the other $3.5million to the Children's Hospital in Los Angeles.  But Terence Dougherty, the ACLU Chief Operating Officer and General Counsel, testified in the trial Thursday, telling the court the organizations' promised donation has not been paid in full yet. Dougherty said that so far only a total of $1.3million has either been paid by Heard or on her behalf. Of that money, Heard contributed $350,000 directly, while $100,000 was paid by Depp and another $350,000 came from a fund at Fidelity, an investment company. Another $500,000 payment came from an account at investment firm Vanguard, which Dougherty said he 'believed it was a fund set up by Elon Musk.' Asked by one of Depp's lawyers if there were messages with Musk about it, Dougherty said there were. He said there was a document and emails they had produced to the lawyers in the case regarding the money. Dougherty said that based on emails with Musk, the ACLU understood that Heard's $3.5million donation would be given over 10 years. He said that Heard's money was considered a 'pledge' so rather than a check all at once, it would come over time. Heard's lawyers have previously told the court that she fully intends to pay the money but for now needs the divorce settlement to pay her legal fees. The court heard that Heard's last donation of $350,000 in December 2018 and that she had not paid any money since. Dougherty said that Heard had told the organization that money was from her anonymous account with Fidelity but they did not do any further checks to guarantee it was her money. One of Depp's lawyers asked Dougherty what 'efforts the ACLU has made to get Amber Heard to pay'. He replied: 'We reached out to Miss Heard starting in 2019 for the next installment of her giving and we learned she was having financial difficulties'. The court heard that Musk played a central role in setting up Heard's donations to the ACLU, partly because he had given to it before. In an email dated August 18, 2016, Musk wrote to Heard and Anthony Romero, the executive director of the ACLU: 'I described your (Heard's) plan to donate $3.5million to the ACLU over the next 10 years as you very much believe in what they're doing'. The court heard that Robin Shulman, a communications strategist with the ACLU wrote the first draft of the op-ed in November 2018, a month before the article was published. In a message to Heard dated November 29, 2018, Shulman said that she tried to 'gather your fire and rage' and shape it into an op-ed piece. Asked if that meant rage against Depp, Dougherty said it was about 'gender-based violence issues'. In a follow up message, Shulman told Heard: 'Our lawyers should review this for the way I skirted around your marriage'. Jessica Weitz, another member of the ACLU communications team, told Heard: 'I want to make sure nothing was said in here that puts you in jeopardy with your NDA' with Depp after the divorce. Shulman and Heard met in person and that op-ed was changed, the court heard. Heard's lawyers also made some edits. One of Depp's lawyers asked Dougherty: 'Some at the ACLU expressed belief that excising references to the marriage and divorce from Johnny Depp made the op-ed less impactful?' Dougherty said: 'That is correct'. Dougherty said that the ACLU had the responsibility of placing the op-ed and considered the New York Times, Washington Post, Teen Vogue and USA Today as places where it could go. As Dougherty put it, the list was in 'descending importance and reach as we go down', but with a greater likelihood they would publish it. Gerry Johnson, one of the ACLU communications team, emailed his colleagues about timing the op-ed so it would come out at the same time as the premiere of Aquaman, the film Heard was starring in. Johnson wrote: 'Since draft turned out pretty strong and Aquaman slated to do large numbers I'm wondering what you think about it?' Dougherty said that media outlets were more likely to take on an op-ed if it had 'strong views' and the more the person was in the public eye at the time, the 'more likely it will be accepted by a more prominent media outlet'. Depp's lawyers asked Dougherty if Heard's marriage to Depp made the op-ed a 'stronger product'. Dougherty said: 'Amber's contributions to the portion of op-ed that talks about personal experiences is what informed the view this was a strong op-ed'. One of Depp's lawyers asked: 'She wanted the op-ed to come out just after Aquaman release?' Dougherty said: 'I recall there was a conversation for optimal timing' Dougherty added that it was 'correct' that Heard wanted the article to come out just after the Aquaman release. On December 11 2018, Witz emailed her colleagues that Heard's team had sent back a final draft but it 'neutered much of her marriage and domestic violence'. Witz said that the goal was the 'get this out this week to capitalize on the tremendous campaign for Aquaman', referring to the publicity surrounding the film. In follow up emails, Witz said that Heard wanted to get a mention of her getting a restraining order back into the article. Witz said: 'Is there an artful way to to do that?' Such a mention did not make it into the final cut. Around that time, Stacey Sullivan, another member of the ACLU's communications pitched the the article to Michael Duffy, an editor at the Washington Post. The email said: 'Hey Michael, wondering if we might interest you in an op-ed by Amber Heard 'Who as you may recall was beaten up during her brief marriage to Johnny Depp' Once it had been agreed the article would be published, Heard emailed her team and the ACLU: 'It's going to the Washington Post!!!' The court also heard about the panic within the ACLU how in 2019 Reuters inquired about how much Heard had paid of her $3.5m pledge. In an email to colleagues, Witz insisted that Heard had 'donated her full settlement to charity' but investigations revealed she had only paid $1.3m As Witz and her colleagues struggled to phrase a statement to Reuters, she emailed her colleagues: 'I had nightmares about this last tonight, do you think this is OK?' Depp's lawyers asked if Witz was 'concerned the ACLU was not telling the truth? As Depp looked on and smiled, Dougherty said: 'She was doing everything she could to give a correct statement to the press'.",
  "fd764d58ed02ce3c8ad7d321d9a56d76b6ad5633305d72a3389164bf": "A former U.S. Marine was killed while fighting alongside Ukrainian forces after the private security firm he worked for sent him to war.  The family of Willy Joseph Cancel, 22, of Orange County New York, confirmed that the husband and father of a seven-month-old son had died in the Ukraine fighting Russian forces on Monday, CNN reported.  He is survived by his wife Brittany, who he married in July 2019, as well as the couple's seven month-old son Anthony.   Cancel's mother, Rebecca Cabrera, said her son was working for a private military contracting company when he agreed to take up a job to fight in the Ukraine following Russia's invasion in February.  'He wanted to go over because he believed in what Ukraine was fighting for, and he wanted to be a part of it to contain it there so it didn't come here, and that maybe our American soldiers wouldn't have to be involved in it,' Cabrera told CNN.  The circumstances of Cancel's death remain unclear, including how and where he was killed.  His mother added that those fighting alongside Cancel were not able to retrieve his body during the conflict that killed him.  'They haven't found his body,' she said. 'They are trying, the men that were with him, but it was either grab his body or get killed, but we would love for him to come back to us.'  The family said Cancel was living in Tennessee working as a corrections officer when he flew to Poland on March 12 and crossed into Ukraine.  Cabrera told CNN that her son was joined by men from 'all different countries' to assist the Ukrainian troops.  'It was something that he believed in his heart, that was the right thing,' Cabrera said. 'He was the type of man who always stepped up when everybody else stepped back, and there were a lot of men who were like that that were with him.' Cancel's brother-in-law, Devin Tietze, echoed Cabrera's remarks, saying that Cancel was the 'type to fight for what's right regardless of the outcome.'  'He believed wholeheartedly this shouldn't have happened and he wanted to go help the people in Ukraine,' Tietze told CNN. The U.S. State Department said they were aware of the reports of Cancel's death but could not comment based on privacy matters.  The Department reiterated in a statement that: 'US citizens should not travel to Ukraine due to the active armed conflict and the singling out of US citizens in Ukraine by Russian government security officials, and that US citizens in Ukraine should depart immediately if it is safe to do so, using any commercial or other privately available ground transportation options.'  It is not known how many U.S. citizens are actively assisting Ukrainian troops in the war, but the Ukrainian Defense Ministry estimates that more than 20,000 volunteer veterans from 52 countries have joined the fight.  The influx of foreign fighters has led the Ukranian government to create the special International Legion, composed of the visiting veterans allied with the country.   Cancel is not the first American to die in the Ukraine as a result of the bloody war.  Jimmy Hill, 67, of Idaho, was gunned down in the streets of Ukraine while buying bread when he refused to leave the warzone because he was looking after his sick partner.  Hill was a lecturer in Kyiv but was in Chernihiv to care for his partner Ira, who has multiple sclerosis. They had returned to the country in December so Ira, who is Ukrainian, could be treated for MS, and became trapped at a regional hospital there.   Hill was among a group of 10 who were lining up to buy bread at a grocery store when Russian troops opened fire in a sickening act of war. Hill's death came just a few days after American journalist and freelance filmmaker Brent Renaud, 50, was shot dead by Russian troops while filming refugees in the Ukraine.  Renaud was in a car with other journalists in Irpin when Putin's troops opened fire. He was fatally-shot in the neck, with one of his colleagues also injured.  Although Renaud was carrying a New York Times press badge at the time of his death, he was in fact working as a freelancer on a global film about refugees commissioned by Time magazine's studio division. Renaud's death was announced by Andrey Nebitov, the head of Kyiv's police department, who said he paid 'with his life for trying to highlight the aggressor's ingenuity, cruelty and ruthlessness.' ",
  "b354eb282615529f1fdea4dadda841e3fcb955cd7fd271be78c0eca9": "A Colorado prison inmate has contracted H5N1 bird flu at a poultry farm where he was placed as part of a pre-release work program.  The unnamed inmate, who is under 40, contracted the bird flu - known medically as avian influenza - at Foster Farms after being directly exposed through culling, the Montrose Press and the CDC reported.  The only symptom he reported was 'fatigue for a few days' and has since recovered. However, the CDC reported he is still be isolated and treated with the influenza antiviral drug oseltamivir.  The Colorado Department of Agriculture said the virus was detected after a single nasal swab and after repeat testing, he came back negative. All employees at the farm were provided personal protective equipment and they have tested negative.  In order to control the outbreak, Foster Farms had to euthanized 60,000 chickens and parts of Montrose and Delta Counties has been put under a quarantine, which restricts poultry growers from moving birds, eggs, and manure off their properties, the Montrose Press reported.  This is the only case of this specific strain of H5 that the US has seen and only the second in the world. The first case was found in the UK in December 2021 in a man who was asymptomatic.  'This case does not change the human risk assessment for the general public, which CDC considers to be low,' the agency said in a press release. However, those who work poultry should take 'appropriate precautions,' it said, which includes avoiding sick or dead birds.  Also known as avian influenza, bird flu is an infectious disease of birds caused by a variant of the standard influenza A virus.   Bird flu is unique in that it can be transmitted directly from birds to humans.  There are 15 different strains of the virus. It is the H5N1 strain which is infecting humans and causing high death rates.  Humans can catch bird flu directly through close contact with live infected birds and those who work with infected chickens are most at risk.    An epidemiologist at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment agreed, telling the Montrose Press: 'We want to reassure Coloradans that the risk to them is low.'  More than 2,500 Americans have been exposed to the virus over the years, but this is the only case to so-far have been identified during the latest outbreak.  The virus is unlikely to spread person-to-person.  The disease has been found in backyard birds in 29 states and in wild birds in 34 states, the CDC reported. It is, however, safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry and poultry products found in the US, the CDC said, as heat will kill the virus.  Some symptoms of the disease, which can range from mild to severe, are: eye infection, upper respiratory symptoms, and pneumonia.  China reported the world's first ever human case of the H3N8 bird flu strain this week.  A four-year-old boy from Zhumadian, in the Henan province, tested positive for the avian influenza strain, local health chiefs confirmed. The child -- who had a fever -- had been in contact with chickens and crows raised at his home. None of the boy's close contacts were infected with the strain. The H3N8 variant -- one of several types of bird flu -- is common in horses and dogs and has even been found in seals. Yet no human cases had been reported until now. ",
  "6b3c6b73b2da3ad36fec605ed8657c92a1fd7e4b8f77dd1791301b55": "Most Australians believe two-up can only be played in pubs and clubs on Anzac Day but there are other occasions the coins can be tossed legally.  While rules vary from state to state, the game can also be played in New South Wales on Victory in the Pacific Day (August 15) and Remembrance Day (November 11) - but only after noon. The former marks the defeat of the Japanese in World War II in 1945 and the later the end of World War 1 in 1918.  A further exemption under the Gambling (Two-up) Act 1998 allows two-up in Broken Hill all year around because of the far western NSW town's historic association with the game.   Thousands of punters flocked to pubs and clubs after the restrictions on two-up were further loosened for this year's Anzac Day. NSW temporarily extended the exemption to the entire long weekend.  The one-off initiative aimed to give back to veterans who missed out during the Covid-19 pandemic at the biggest Anzac Day commemoration since 2019.   Victoria's Gambling Regulation Act 2003 permits the conduct of two-up on Anzac Day - or in the seven days leading up to April 25 - at any RSL club, sub-branch or other venue used by the veterans' organisation. Queensland allows two-up to be played in an RSL club on Anzac Day or 'another day that is significant to the remembrance of the sacrifice for the nation by the men and women of its Defence Force.' In South Australia, the game is 'not unlawful' when played on Anzac Day on premises occupied by the RSL or the Defence Force. Two-up can only be played in Tasmania on Anzac Day, between 6am and 6pm, and permits can be sought in Western Australia for games on Anzac Day and August 18 - Vietnam Veterans' Day.  Western Australia also permits two-up at country race clubs more than 100km from the Crown Perth casino. It can only be played on race days.   The Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory allow two-up to be played on Anzac Day.    Australian soldiers regularly played two-up in trenches and on troopships during World War I but it was already popular among convicts in the late 18th century and on the goldfields of the 1850s.  Veterans continued to play the game when they returned home from war until it was eventually banned by the NSW government in 1981. Other states followed suit several years later.  The game involves a designated 'spinner' who throws two pennies into the air as players bet on whether the coins will land on heads or tails.  These rules can be used to govern the playing of Two-up, but are not mandatory. The decision of the ringkeeper will be final The ringkeeper shall select a spinner by offering the kip clockwise around the ring and shall hand the kip to the first person who accepts it There shall be two sets of seven pennies held by the ringkeeper. The spinner shall select two pennies from one of the sets, thrown down inside the ring by the ringkeeper Only two pennies shall be used A change of pennies shall be at the discretion of the ringkeeper The tail side of pennies will be marked with a white cross The spinner shall place pennies tails up on the kip The spinner shall select two other pennies from the remaining five of the set after throwing three consecutive pairs of heads. The ringkeeper shall retain the winning two pennies and throw down the balance of the set for the spinner to make the selection The spinner cannot take a dividend before three consecutive heads are thrown In the event that the spinner throws tails, the spinner shall lose the total of the moneys in the centre and the right to spin The ringkeeper shall declare a spin invalid by announcing 'no spin' or 'barred' Centre monies shall be set in full before any side bets may be made Only the spinner shall be permitted within the boundaries of the ring during play A spinner after throwing three consecutive pairs of heads may withdraw from the centre No person under the age of 18 years shall be permitted in that area of the Two-up premises where the game is being conducted while the game is being conducted and played Unseemly conduct or offensive language shall not be tolerated The spinner shall hand the ringkeeper the amount of money the spinner wishes to spin for, the ringkeeper shall hold that money and the equivalent amount from a tail bettor to cover the bet Source: Liquor and Gaming NSW",
  "72ed5afc1d3983230c3d513c70f46bd5d936b982f54d6ab25927bbc9": "An eshay has warned homeowners not to leave boxes for expensive gear outside their homes because it attracts thieves, telling them exactly what's in the house. The man, who refers to himself as Tyso in the tongue-in-cheek video, filmed himself walking down a quiet suburban street in western Sydney. He is seen wearing a bum bag over his shoulder and a white cap on his head, with a cigarette stuck to the side of his face.  He comes up to a heap of discarded and empty TV boxes, waiting to be picked up by garbage collectors - one being for a $1,600 Sony television.  'Oi, braz I'll tell you this right,' he says.  'Don't do this braz. Old mate here, big TV. You know what that says to me, braz? 'Big TV in there mate, you just bought it. I'll be back later on'. 'F**king Tyso's going to get himself a big Sony.' The eshay then points the camera to the boxes to reveal it is a 46 inch Sony Bravia TV/ He reads the Sony logo on the top: 'Sony. Make. Believe'. 'I believe it's going to be mine now, braz,' he says, in a tongue in cheek remark. 'Don't leave boxes out the front. It's f**king red hot.' The video was uploaded to Facebook where social media users were quick to agree with the eshay. Daily Mail Australia is not implying the man planned to steal the television, and was merely warning people on social media.  Eshays wear Nike TN trainers with polo shirts, puffer jackets, tracksuit pants or baggy shorts and baseball caps. Favoured labels include Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, and Lacoste, paired with Nautica, Adidas, Under Armour and Ellesse. Some eshays scramble words and put 'ay' on the end in a form of pig Latin. 'Eetswa' means 'sweet' and 'chill' becomes 'illchay'.  Hard-core eshays engage in assaults, robberies and threatening behaviour against other youths but many seem to wander the streets aimlessly.  'Tyso about to be watching daytime TV in luxury,' one person commented. Another person said: 'Keep an eye out for an LG OLED for me yeah?'. What is an Eshay?  Eshays prowl in packs, speaking their own mashed-up language as they strut around town in designer sportswear with a generally menacing attitude. But are eshays a serious threat to polite society or just the latest incarnation of disaffected youths wanting to stand out from the crowd by looking the same as each other? Whatever the motive for urban teenagers with bad haircuts donning Nike TNs and slinging bumbags over one shoulder, they are apparently overtaking the suburbs. Where eshays once predominantly came from disadvantaged backgrounds their ethos is now more mainstream and widely promoted on social media. An eshay is easily identifiable by the aforementioned TN trainers, worn with polo shirts, puffer jackets, tracksuit pants or baggy shorts and baseball caps. Favoured labels for the fashionable eshay include Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, and Lacoste, paired with Nautica, Adidas, Under Armour and Ellesse. He should give the impression he is looking to score drugs or moments away from robbing an innocent passerby of their belongings. Some eshays scramble words and put 'ay' on the end in a form of pig Latin. 'Eetswa' means 'sweet' and 'chill' becomes 'illchay'. The term eshay is similar to the UK phrase 'chav' and can be interchangeable with 'lad', which in turn sometimes becomes 'adlay'. 'Eshay' may have started as 'eshay adlay' - pig Latin for 'he's lad' or be related to 'sesh', for a prolonged period of drug consumption. When an eshay says 'eshay' it can mean yes, cool or excellent. Something high-risk is 'red hot' and an idiot is a 'gronk'. To 'staunch' someone is to intimidate them, often with an intense stare while the challenger's fists are held between their legs. Eshays are said to have spread from Sydney's inner-city graffiti scene in the 1980s through Housing Commission estates and out into the suburbs. Hard-core eshays engage in assaults, robberies and threatening behaviour against other youths but many seem to wander the streets and hang around train stations aimlessly. Some are said to 'roll' victims for their shoes and clothes but such crimes are not widely reported. While some eshays had domestic backgrounds of violence, poverty and drug or alcohol use, many were likely copying a look that suggested a criminal outlook. Their antics, which can include carrying weapons and taking drugs, are often filmed and posted on Tik Tok to widespread amusement. The drill rap of groups such as Mount Druit outfit OneFour is a popular accompaniment. Parents on Sydney's Northern Beaches have recently expressed concerns about anti-social behaviour of teens they describe as dressing like eshays. Dr Terry Goldsworthy, Associate Professor of Criminology at Bond University told the Telegraph eshays had become prominent in the past seven or so years. 'Like any subculture there are influencers on social media,' the onetime detective inspector said. 'It's monkey see, monkey do. 'A few years ago I'd never heard the term eshay, but I think social media has something to do with it.' Just like punks in the 1970s and 1980s the eshay will one day be replaced by another set of clothes and taste in music, with a new name and similar anti-authoritarian demeanour. 'Like any subculture, today's eshay will be tomorrow's nerd,' Dr Goldsworthy said.",

City News Kalgoorlie owners Tania and Kevin Parkes have accused local man Mark Ing of falsely claiming a $261,986 share in the eye watering stake in February. Some 250 people won the $63million jackpot after paying just $100 for a ticket.  The Parkes family have lodged a writ of summons in the Supreme Court of Western Australia. The development was first reported by PerthNow.  The pair allege that Mr Ing made 'untrue' claims to Lotterywest that he had bought a ticket in the winning No. Two Syndicate. The court document alleges Mr Ing had actually bought a ticket for the No. One Syndicate. He was able to make the claim after the owners of the news agency allowed him 'to present one of their tickets ... on the basis that the defendant's (alleged) ticket could be presented by mail'.  The couple claim he failed to send the appropriate ticket to Lotterywest, according to PerthNow. 'Despite a formal dispute of ownership filed by the plaintiffs with Lotterywest, Lotterywest informed the plaintiffs that it intended to disburse the winnings on their ticket to the defendant,' the document states.  Ms Parke declined to comment, when approached by Daily Mail Australia, as the matter was still before the court. The $63million draw marks one of the largest wins in Lotto history.  A single parent with four foster children and a pair of struggling business owners were among the winners.  The current titleholder for the largest jackpot winner is a Sydney nurse, who won more than $107 million in 2019.  The civil matter against Mr Ing will be heard before the court on August 2. ",
  "cc6611b9bf661d81f884177d799a3b8a3c70a857e30ced154d2dce65": "A woman has been rushed to hospital after she was attacked by a kangaroo at a golf club.  Emergency services said the marsupial scratched the 69-year-old at Arundel Hills Country Club in the Gold Coast just after 9am on Friday morning.  The woman may need stitches on her jaw after suffering multiple lacerations to her face, as well as her arms and legs. She also sustained injuries to her head and was taken by ambulance to Pindara Private Hospital in a stable condition. The 69-year-old was reportedly attacked behind by the large animal, who kicked her and knocked her to the ground. Queensland Ambulance Service operations supervisor Joel McEwan said upon hitting the ground the woman was stomped on by the kangaroo several times.  'The patient was quite upset at the scene -- obviously it's a shock being attacked by quite a large kangaroo,' he said.  Kangaroos have been known to visit the Arundel Hills Country Club. Last year amazing footage surfaced of a mob of kangaroos parking themselves on the green near where a golfer was teeing off.",
  "ef27400fa83937d1b97fe7233293f9d24d5e8618082942599a0d9ef4": "The devastated son of an elderly man ruthlessly beaten to death has spoken of the horror of cleaning his father's bloodied home after the attack. Emiliano Lombardi, 84, was killed by 29-year-old Quade Karsum Jones when he went on an hour-long crime spree, assaulting six other people in August, 2020 in Perth's east. A heavily intoxicated Jones tore off the side mirror from Mr Lombardi's car and smashed it over his head and face, leaving the grandfather with catastrophic injuries and soaked in blood. Jones was on Thursday sentenced to life behind bars in the West Australian Supreme Court and will be eligible for parole in 2043. In an emotional victim impact statement, Mr Lombardi's son Don detailed how losing his 'papa' had 'broken me as a man'. The 84-year-old spent two weeks in hospital but eventually asked his family to stop treatment and 'let me go'. 'Every part of these two weeks I will never forget and are permanently etched on my brain,' Don said in his statement. 'This experience broke me as a man and affected me to the core of my existence. My sister, brother and I held my dad for hours in his final hours to say it was going to be okay.' Don said adding to the trauma of losing his father was the task of cleaning his East Cannington home. 'Going to my dad's house to see blood everywhere was so private and personal and I remember not letting my wife come into the house - not wanting her to see the pain in the house and see my pain clearly on my face,' he said. 'Blood on every door, wall, floor and piece of furniture.  'I remember wanting to clean this house with my sister to clean the blood to erase the memory of the incident - trying to heal my dad as I was healing that house.' Mr Lombardi was Jones' fifth victim of the day on August 16, 2020. Jones' first victim was a man who had seen co-accused Joshua Cates spray graffiti on a bench. Cates was cleared of being an accessory to murder in December 2020, but ordered to do 40 hours of community service for graffiti during the crime spree.  Jones tried to confront the man but he got in his car and drove off, but had to later slow down when he came to an intersection.  Jones ran up to his car and started punching the passenger side window. He then opened the driver's door and punched and kicked the man. Jones tried to take the keys out of the ignition and in the process pulled off three keys which belonged to the man's partner. The man suffered swelling to his jaw and reported the incident. A short time later Jones saw a woman outside her home and proceeded to grab her hair and shake her head, after asking for cigarettes and money. She tried to run inside her home and screamed, alerting her two housemates to come outside. Upon seeing Jones they tried to close the front door on him but he forced his way inside and then attacked one of the housemates, punching him in the face, shoulder and chest. His fourth victim was a woman who Jones 'walloped' on the back of her body before attempting to throw a can at her as she walked down the street. Mr Lombardi, the fifth victim of the day, lived alone and was in good health at the time of his 'very severe and vicious assault'. After being beaten over the head and dripping with blood, Mr Lombardi was able to make his way inside his home and into his bed. Jones continued on his rampage of terror, going on to beat up another neighbour who was too terrified to run inside his home in case his attacker followed him and harmed his family. The 29-year-old then pulled a letterbox out of the ground and hurled it towards the man but it didn't connect. Jones then headed to a nearby train station and stole a beanie from a woman heading home. He then grabbed a nearby sign and started whacking her on her back, causing bruising before a passerby saw the assault and Jones fled the scene. Jones, who'd been using meth since he was 17, then took a train to Armadale where he visited a pub and stayed in the restroom for an hour.  Paper towels, soap and water were found all over the bathroom as Jones tried to clean any blood off of himself. Following Mr Lombardi's assault the elderly man suffered injuries to his brain and right eye, and fractures to his face and shoulder. In his sentencing, Justice Stephen Hall said there was no 'rational reason' for Jones' violent attacks. 'You attacked indiscriminately, anyone who had the misfortune to come into contact with you,' he said. 'The attacks in each case were shocking and frightening.' 'Despite the obvious severity of the injuries to Mr Lombardi, you made no effort to render him assistance. Rather, you left him alone and badly injured and continued on your way, attacking others as you went.'  Director of Public Prosecutions Amanda Forrester SC described called Jones' attack on Mr Lombardi as a 'very severe and vicious assault' and noted the innocent man was 'savagely beaten' in the head and face with the broken mirror. Defence lawyer Bernard Standish said Jones had no 'true memory' of the vicious attacks but was heavily intoxicated at the time.  There has been no suggestion that Jones suffers from a mental illness or a personality disorder that could have contributed to his cruel actions.  Jones was not arrested until four days after the attacks on August 20, 2020. By that time it was too late for police to test if Jones had any drugs in his system at the time of the events. Jones' lawyer has insisted he feels guilty for his actions and that Jones 'clearly didn't have an intention to kill'. 'He regrets it, it's behaviour he thinks about all the time and if he could take it back, he could,' he said. The court heard the attacks were not Jones' first case of intoxicated violence and that he had beat his father over the head with a coffee cup in 2016. Jones had initially pleaded his innocence and was set to face court in late February but changed his plea to guilty late last year. ",
  "6784a0e2f042b5ba92faa824ab09a936ad30ea311cae9d25a35e0b0a": "A disgraced property developer has agreed to pay $18.85 million to the family of a  woman struck and killed by his 17 year-old son doing 100mph in a Lamborghini he'd been bought for his birthday.  Brandon Khuri, the driver of the vehicle and the son of real estate mogul James Khuri, was racing the $200,000 Urus in a 35-mph zone on a West Los Angeles freeway, when he crashed into a Lexus driven by Monique Munoz, 32. The settlement, revealed on Thursday, is one of the largest amounts for a single plaintiff in a wrongful death case in California history, according to the family's lawyer.  Khuri was condemned as one of America's most irresponsible fathers after his son slaughtered Munoz. His killer son was sentenced to just seven to nine months in a juvenile camp, and four months probation. Astonishingly, the arrogant multi-millionaires even suggested Khuri be allowed to serve his sentence at home confinement inside their luxury mansion.   'Today is a significant milestone because the Munoz family can finally get some closure for this horrific tragedy,'' attorney Daniel Ghyczy said in a statement on Wednesday, NBC Los Angeles reported. He continued: 'It was never about money for the Munoz family, it was about the acknowledgment of Brendan Khuri's misconduct that resulted in the death of their only daughter and to ensure that he was held accountable. 'Today's settlement is a testament to their efforts and is a step closer to justice.'  He continued: 'The family faced numerous hurdles from both private insurance companies and the L.A. District Attorney's office, and experienced the harsh realities of racism and bias against those from underserved communities.'   The $18.8 million settlement is tied to a lawsuit filed last year in Los Angeles claiming that Chubb Insurance had discriminated against the Latina woman when calculating the wrongful-death claim award amount, the news outlet said.  Munoz, who had been driving home from her job at UCLA Health in Los Angeles, had been trapped in the wreckage following the crash and died at the scene, the LA Police Department said. She had been preparing to start law school.     On Wednesday, new video of the fatal crash was also released, which showed Khuri running a red light in his Lamborghini SUV before his vehicle slammed into the vehicle of Munoz, killing her.   In April, Khuri pleaded guilty to vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence in Inglewood Juvenile Court. Prosecutors were outraged when his defense argued that he should serve the majority of his sentence in probation at his family's mansion. Khuri's attorney, Mark Werksman, said the teen was diagnosed with autism, and attention deficit disorder following the crash, where they claimed he sustained brain injuries, the Los Angeles Times reported. Psychologist Karen Schiltz, who testified before the Los Angeles County Superior Court, said Khuri likely suffered from autism his entire life but was never diagnosed and that he would be 'victimized' if he were to be held in an LA County juvenile camp. Munoz's family believed Khuri's sentence was too lenient. In August protests were held over the case. Munoz's uncle, Richard Cartier, had called on the court to deny house arrest for the teen.       'I'm looking for this kid to actually get what he deserves,' Munoz's uncle Richard Cartier told ABC7.  'He murdered my niece and he had no remorse for any life of any kind and he showed it. The distraught family believes the teen is getting special treatment because of his father's wealth.   Khuri's father, James, is a multi-millionaire who owns several real estate firms and an e-commerce business. Despite Brendan's repeated apologies, the Munoz family have called for the teen take accountability for his crime.  Weeks before the deadly crash, the teen had put up social media posts about his racing and drifting activities in his luxury car that retails for a minimum of $218,000.  LA police officials testified that the teen had been cited twice for excessive speeding and had even had his license suspended over his antics in the Lamborghini. Munoz's stepfather, Isaac Cordona, 55, of Hawthorne, California, spoke of his heartbreak in an interview with DailyMail.com in a 2021 interview. His wife, Monique's mother Carol, 54, was too upset to speak to DailyMail.com but told of her heartbreak in a Facebook post on February 18. She wrote: 'My baby my life my everything my heart is broken in so many pieces mommy is going to miss you sooo much. 'I LOVE YOU FOREVER BABY FEELS LIKE A BAD DREAM RIP MY BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS.'              teen son of a multimillionaire -- who was driving a Lamborghini in excess of 100 mph -- have reached an $18 million settlement. Monique Munoz, a 32-year-old secretary from Hawthorne, died in February 2021 in West Los Angeles when the luxury car driven by the then-17-year-old son of real estate magnate James Khuri slammed into her Lexus, the Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday. The crash occurred during rush-hour traffic in a 35-mph zone when Munoz was driving home from her job at UCLA Health in Los Angeles, NBC Los Angeles reported. The $18.8 million settlement is tied to a lawsuit filed last year in Los Angeles claiming that Chubb Insurance had discriminated against the Latina woman when calculating the wrongful-death claim award amount, according to the newspaper.

Several Sydneysiders have shared pictures of the mass crowds at the airport on Friday. One woman said the line to get through international security was 'easily 300 metres long'. Another traveller said the queues were 'absolutely astonishing'. 'I'm 1/2 way now after almost an hour,' they tweeted with a picture of huge line of travellers in front of them. One man said on Friday morning there were just five out of 13 security checkpoints open and the wait time was at least an hour long. 'You (Sydney Airport) really need to fix the security check-in and get your customer service back to where it was pre-pandemic. You will lose so many customers,' tweeted one fed up traveller.  'An hour and a half in the queue so far, still a couple of hundred people before security,' another said.  One disgruntled passenger said the airport was 'a s**t show with long lines and no staff.'  'How hard is it to provide some level of service.' Sydney Airport has been contacted for comment.  Earlier this month there were huge delays for travellers planning a trip for the start of school holidays with queues stretching to one kilometre long. Passengers complained of missing their flights while some claimed the long hold-up in the terminals was worsened by queue jumpers barging to the front of the lines.  Airport bosses blamed school holidays, a shortage of security personnel and, remarkably, forgetful passengers out of the habit of removing items from their luggage for scanning.  'We're facing a perfect storm at the moment. Traffic numbers are picking up, travellers are inexperienced after two years of not travelling, and the close contact rules are making it hard to fill shifts and staff the airport,' Sydney Airport chief executive Geoff Culbert told the Sydney Morning Herald at the time.  Widespread domestic air travel only recommenced earlier this year as states dropped Covid border restrictions as nationwide vaccination levels rose above 90 per cent. ",
  "e2efd339689913be5249abf543fca2b9c52b61b30b5163fb608d2448": "Bodybuilding champion Gary Lewer will be kicked out of Australia after a court bid to overturn his pending deportation was rejected. The former Mr Universe will be sent back to the UK, two years after Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton called for his deportation on character grounds. Mr Lewer, 66, accepted he had a substantial criminal record including receiving a conviction and prison sentence on weapons charges more than 25 years ago. He also has a 2004 conviction for selling steroids which was included in a police dossier that formed part of the basis for Mr Dutton's decision. Mr Lewer argued there had been no substantial change in his character since a visa was last granted to him in 2017, but police said they believe he is involved in a sophisticated criminal drug importation and manufacturing enterprise. He has never been convicted. Victoria Police claimed that was because he 'possesses sound knowledge of police investigation methodology, is extremely disciplined in his criminal conduct to avoid detection and therefore is an extremely difficult suspect to investigate'. Mr Lewer said their suspicion or belief was not evidence that could support Mr Dutton's assessment of him. But Federal Court judge Justice Bernard Murphy rejected the argument and upheld Mr Lewer's visa cancellation. Mr Lewer, a three-time world champion bodybuilder, left Britain at five and has never taken up Australian citizenship. Friends have previously described the deportation calls as 'unjust' and 'a result of a long standing vendetta' by Victoria Police. Mr Lewer is being held in immigration detention in Melbourne.",
  "6b9f803a3e46c5caad9e4a3bcd0248697228dc58942b83e83f12289b": "A mom who suffocated her baby while high on drugs then dumped his body in the trash has been stabbed to death by the infant's dad while awaiting trial, police say.   LaDonia Boggs, 39, was found unresponsive by police in the doorway of her DC apartment around 3am on Wednesday with 'an apparent stab wound.'  Police reported Carl Jones - who was father to the couple's late son Kyon Jones -  reportedly stabbed her during a 'domestic dispute,' authorities reported.  Jones was arrested and charged with second degree murder while armed, DC police said in a statement. No motive has been given, with Boggs and Jones linked by the notorious death of their baby son. Kyon went missing in early May 2021, aged just two months old.  Boggs was arrested in late May on counts of felony murder and evidence tampering in connection with the presumed death of her infant son, Kyon Jones.  She is said to have been high on a drug called angel dust when she accidentally smothered Kyon. Boggs claimed she then dumped her son's body in the trash. Despite extensive searches of local landfill sites, his remains have never been found.   The murder charge was later dropped, but she was still awaiting trial for evidence tampering after the baby's remains were unable to be found.  Boggs' told authorities she accidentally rolled on top of her son while under the influence of angel dust, a hallucinogenic drug also known as PCP.  'He was asleep on my chest and when I woke up, he wasn't breathing anymore, because he was just that small. He was only 2 months old. He was a premature baby, she said, according to NBC Washington.  The mother said she headed outside and went around the block 'a few times' before returning the her apartment to check on her son, who was still not breathing. 'I came back in the house and got a blanket and his car seat and wrapped it up and took it outside and just [threw] it in the trash,' she says haltingly. 'And that's what happened.' According to court documents, Boggs offered conflicting accounts of what happened to her son to the boy's father and the police. The woman initially told Kyon's biological father that the infant would be gone 'for a long time' because DC Child and Family Services took custody of him, but the agency denied having the baby. During an interview with the police that took place a day after Kyon was reported missing, Boggs reportedly admitted that he died while sleeping between her and a wall. Boggs said she woke up to find the infant unresponsive beneath her stomach. In a follow-up interview with the police, the mother was said to have admitted that she panicked and tossed Kyon's body in the trash while high on PCP and hallucinating. Boggs also said she did not know the whereabouts of Kyon's body. Surveillance video from Boggs' apartment complex showed her carrying a plastic bag, a cardboard box and a car seat to a dumpster. The box was described in court records cited by WTOP as being 'large enough to carry a 2-month-old infant.' Officers accompanied by cadaver dogs scoured a landfill in Virginia last week, but the missing boy was not located. The court documents noted that at the time of her arrest, Boggs retracted her statement concerning her alleged use of PCP at the time of Kyon's death, claiming that the last time she smoked the drug was a day or two prior. Boggs was released without bond to DC's Pretrial Services Agency following her arraignment on Saturday. She was due back in court on November 19.",
  "452fc5b952d29e0e93f626d0a7411e7d4416a77ee24b18807984283e": "Netflix has begun firing staff after missing its subscriber target by 200,000 people and watching the value of its shares tank by 50 per cent in a month.   The streamer made the layoffs at Tudum, a website filled with stories that are meant to market Netflix's programs.  At least 10-15 staff tweeted about being fired, although the exact number dismissed remains unclear.   The site, named as an onomatopoeia for the sound you hear when a Netflix show begins, was meant to allow subscribers insider access to the company's shows.    Netflix refused to tell the Los Angeles Times how many jobs were cut, merely saying  'our fan website Tudum is an important priority for the company.'  Some of those laid off took to Twitter, saying that the company had only hired them months earlier. Their dismissals come after Elon Musk said 'the woke mind virus' had left many of Netflix's Originals 'unwatchable.'  'Netflix recruited me seven months ago only to lay me and a bunch of other talented people off today,' tweeted Evette Dionne, a former editorial staffer .  Sara David wrote: 'I have unfortunately also been laid off by Netflix and am looking for writer/editor gigs' 'So. I got laid off from Netflix/Tudum today. Media is gonna media even when it's not technically media, I guess,' said Alex Zaragoza.  Josh Terry added: 'Uh oh! Looks like I have to do this tweet again. Is anyone hiring? Netflix just laid off my team (my job included). It was an incredible few months and I'm grateful for it but I'm stoked about whatever's next. Email is in bio.'  There have been several hypotheses for why the streamer is losing eyeballs, with many including Tesla CEO (and potential future Twitter chief) Elon Musk blaming 'the woke mind virus.'  Responding to a tweet about the subscription service's devastating performance, Musk said: 'The woke mind virus is making Netflix unwatchable.' A follower then responded: 'Woke mind virus is the biggest threat to the civilization.' The world's richest man replied to him: 'Yes.'  Fans applauded Musk's comments with some even urging him to take over Netflix after he concludes his Twitter deal. The Tesla founder is reportedly plotting to spend up to $15 billion of his own cash to take Twitter private and will launch a second takeover bid in 10 days. The billionaire, who is Twitter's second-biggest shareholder with a 9.1 percent stake, has tapped Morgan Stanley to raise $10 billion in debt and will make his next offer in a week-and-a-half, according to the New York Post. The entrepreneur worth $273 billion is also looking to borrow against his existing 9.2 per cent in the company, which could mean several billion dollars more to make his bid, the Post reported. Others, however, have suggested that the real problem is Netflix's habit of canceling beloved shows before their time, angering fans.   Popular TV dramas like The OA, Marco Polo, and The Punisher are being cancelled by the service after series two - leaving fans furious and threatening to cancel their subscriptions because they no longer want to 'invest their time in a series' over fears it will be 'culled'. Meanwhile, over half of Netflix's own reality TV shows and dramas released in 2018 have not been commissioned for a second series, compared with more than a third launched in 2017 and 28 percent in 2016, reports The Times.  It comes as the streaming behemoth has lost 200,000 subscribers in just three months, while shareholders of the US firm have been warned to expect another two million subscribers to leave in the three months to July. Bosses say a second price-rise in a year has played a part, while the company has lost 700,000 following its decision to pull out of Russia in the wake of Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Netflix said the Covid boom had 'created a lot of noise' and blamed the slowdown on the return to normality after two years of lockdowns. It also blamed password sharing for the rise in cancelled accounts, as it estimated that about 10million households worldwide are watching its service for free by using the account of a friend or another family member. The company has now started testing different ways of curbing password sharing in Chile, Costa Rica and Peru - and could extend this elsewhere if it proves successful. Bosses are also considering turning the service into a low-fee subscription supported by ads. Netflix also claimed that the market had now been 'saturated' by rising competition from streaming services including Disney+, Apple TV, Now TV, Warner Bros Discovery and Paramount, the cost-of-living crisis gripping the US, Canada and Western Europe, and its decision to quit streaming in Russia after Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine in February. And Netflix is also facing another expensive outlay in the form of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, having shelled out for a $100million deal with the couple in September 2020. As of yet, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are yet to produce any published content for the streaming giant. But the company will be pinning their hopes that their upcoming series documenting the recent Invictus Games will prove value for money. The rapid rise of rival Disney+, which has seen billions of dollars of investment in recent years, has seen competition in the streaming market increase dramatically. And other services like Amazon Prime Video, which has captured a share of the live football market in the UK, and AppleTV+, which has seen success through football comedy Ted Lasso, have also seen people turn away from Netflix.  Despite the streaming service's recent issues, there have been some successes, with dystopian Korean series Squid Game proving a huge hit, and season one of period drama Bridgerton taking the world by storm.  However fan favourites such as Bloodline and Jessica Jones were cancelled after their third season, leaving viewers frustrated and 'tired of starting something new only for it to be cancelled two years later'.",
  "a752b4745ab4e537db0d1027e7c6a078736c0623843466a669ae2138": "Australian homeowners are being warned to brace for a 15 per cent plunge in house prices with the big banks now all expecting a rate rise next week and more to follow. The Reserve Bank of Australia is widely expected to raise the cash rate on May 3 by 0.15 percentage points from a record-low of 0.1 per cent following the biggest inflation surge in 21 years. Three of Australia's Big Four banks - ANZ, Westpac and NAB - are expecting the RBA to increase the cash rate on Tuesday, marking the first increase since November 2010. They are also expecting the cash rate to hit two per cent by 2023 for the first time since May 2016, which would see monthly repayments on a typical $600,000 mortgage surge by $625 within a year. Just three weeks ago, the RBA predicted an increase in the cash rate to two per cent would cause Australian property prices to plunge by 15 per cent. 'Estimates using a model of the housing market that takes into account historical relationships between interest rates and both demand and supply factors suggest that a 200 basis point increase in interest rates from current levels would lower real housing prices by around 15 per cent over a two-year period, relative to the baseline model projection in the absence of an interest rate shock,' it said in an April 8 report. Nationwide, the Australian median property price has surged 18.2 per cent during the past year to $738,975.   A 15 per cent plunge of $110,846 would only take middle-range prices back to about $628,129, CoreLogic data showed.  Sydney's median house price has climbed by 20.6 per cent to $1.403million in the year to March.  A 15 per cent drop would see values fall by $210,473 down to $1.192million - or May 2021 levels. In Melbourne, median house prices have risen by a more subdued annual pace of 11.9 per cent.  A 15 per cent drop would see values fall by $149,856 - from $999,037 to $849,181 - hitting the lowest levels since May 2017. In Perth, where values climbed by just 7.2 per cent over the year, a 15 per cent or $85,216 fall in house prices - from $568,108 to $482,892 - would see the median level sink to a June 2009 low, in a market that peaked in 2014 after the last mining boom. WESTPAC: May increase of 0.15 percentage points. Cash rate to reach 2 per cent by May 2023 NAB: May rise of 0.15 per cent. Cash rate to reach 2.5 per cent by August 2024 ANZ: May rise of 0.15 percentage points. Cash rate of 2.25 per cent over the next 12 months and peak above 3 per cent but not until sometime after 2023 Source: RateCity  In Brisbane, house prices have risen by 32.1 per cent to $856,731 so a 15 per cent drop of $128,510 would take values back to $728,221 - which would be the lowest since July last year. In Adelaide, house prices have climbed by 28.7 per cent in a year to $658,446, so a 15 per cent drop of $98,767 would take values back to $559,679 - an August 2021 low. A national fall of 15 per cent would mirror what happened in Sydney between 2017 and 2019, before the pandemic, after the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority tightened the rules on investor and interest-only loans. But during that two-year period, national property prices fell by a lesser 8.4 per cent.  The Reserve Bank is now tipped to raise rates next week, ahead of the May 21 election, after headline inflation in the year to March climbed by 5.1 per cent - the fastest annual pace since June 2001 following the GST introduction.  Inflation is also well above the RBA's two to three per cent target. An RBA rate rise next month would be the first during an election campaign since November 2007, when Liberal prime minister John Howard was voted out of office after 11 years.   Three of the Big Four banks - ANZ, Westpac and NAB - are expecting the cash rate to rise by a record-low of 0.1 per cent from next week to hit 2 per cent in the coming year.  A 1.9 percentage point rise in the RBA cash rate by 2023 would see a typical Australian borrower, with a $600,000 mortgage, cop a monthly repayment jump of $625 - from $2,306 to $2,931. This would occur as their variable mortgage rate rose from 2.29 per cent to 4.19 per cent. RateCity.com research director Sally Tindall said borrowers needed to prepare for next week's possible rate rise. 'A rate hike next week is now a live possibility on the back of Wednesday's surging and surprising inflation figures,' she said.  'Three of the big four banks are now predicting the RBA will pull the trigger on a May cash rate hike.' The Commonwealth Bank, Australia's biggest home lender, is the only major bank predicting a rate rise in June instead of May. Unlike the other big banks, it's forecasting a cash rate peak in this cycle of 1.25 per cent by February 2023 instead of 2 per cent as ANZ, Westpac and NAB are predicting. ",
  "2039b201302b8869ec802e946bbd1f42112b9742ca558f820660ab2a": "Kim Kardashian's boyfriend Pete Davidson was in court on Thursday to support her during closing statements in their defamation trial, as the family's lawyer described Blac Chyna - accusing the family of sabotaging her reality TV show - as a domestic abuser and a liar.  The jury began their deliberations at 4.30pm on Thursday - shortly after comic and SNL star Davidson, dressed in a black sweatshirt and white jeans, slipped into the courtroom and sat in the back, behind the family. He left the court with Kim.  Shortly before the jury retired to consider their verdict, they were told that the show starring Rob Kardashian and Chyna, his then-girlfriend, was cancelled simply because the couple broke up. Michael Rhodes, representing the Kardashians, urged the jury in his summing up 'to let the family start to heal.' He said there was no substance to Chyna's suit, seeking damages for economic loss of $108 million, saying she had failed to present any hard financial evidence of loss of income or of emotional distress. Rhodes said that Chyna was violent and aggressive. 'Did Chyna beat the s*** out of Rob? Yes, she did,' he said. 'It was true. It happened.' Rhodes, referred to the day of Chyna and her 35-year-old boyfriend's 'big fight' in December 2016, when she packed up and left their home with their baby girl, Dream, born a month earlier. Rob Kardashian said that she hit him with a six-foot rod, pulled a phone cord around his neck and twice pointed a gun at his head. During her testimony, Chyna, 33, denied that they broke up at that point. Chyna maintains their relationship ended in the summer of 2017, but the defendants say Chyna acknowledged in a written declaration that the two split in December 2016. Rhodes told jurors on Thursday that she denied the relationship had ended because she wanted to show the television program was still viable. 'She had to confirm the relationship was still ok because she has to convince you that the network still wanted her show,' Rhodes said. 'This was not a relationship that any network executive wants on TV.' 'Rob & Chyna' premiered in September 2016 and ran for one season. The series was renewed for a second season, but in light of Kardashian and Chyna's breakup, plans for Season 2 were put on hold. Chyna alleges the Kardashians spread false reports of her assaulting him in order to have the 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' spinoff canceled and ruin her reality TV career.  E! network executives testified during the trial that 'Rob & Chyna' was supposed to be a light-hearted romantic comedy. The court was also told that a producer on the show told Chyna that if she wanted a second season of the show, she would have to mend her relationship with Kardashian, and suggested counseling could help. Rhodes on Thursday said Chyna's reaction to the idea was: 'F*** no, f*** that. 'F*** Rob. I'm not doing that.' Rhodes asked the jury: 'Is this the relationship you want to build your romantic comedy around? 'Somebody who would say that to her baby's father? Would you put this on the air?' Asking the jury to 'walk with me' over to his clients - Rhodes represents Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner, who are all defendants - he pointed at the assembled Kardashians and said: 'This is the child's grandmother, her aunts.' Rhodes told the jury to recall the 'pain and anguish' on Rob Kardashian's face during his testimony on Wednesday, noting: 'That was real. This is a real family. 'Yes they're famous, but they're real people. 'Just because Rob is a big guy, doesn't mean he can't be a victim. 'How would you feel if you child went through this? 'Picture Rob. What did he look like? Was that fake?' Rhodes also accused Chyna of 'hiding her money' and not filing tax returns for three years. Under oath, Chyna admitted that she told her accountant to stop preparing her tax returns for the year 2019 and has not paid taxes since. 'You cheated the government - but we're going to give you millions of dollars - is that right?' he asked the jury. 'That's concealment.' She was accused during the fight of smashing a TV, a bedroom door and a Christmas gingerbread house. 'The gingerbread house was silly, over the top and beautiful - like the Kardashians,' said Rhodes. 'When she smashed it, she was venting her anger on everything she was not going to be.' Earlier on Thursday, the judge denied Chyna's request to repeat her testimony against the Kardashians after she became upset and walked off the stand when she was shown a nude photo of herself during cross-examination.  December 14, 2016 -  Chyna says she and her then-fiance were 'laughing and joking and being silly' as they celebrated season two of Rob and Chyna being greenlit by NBC  Universal.  She denies yelling 'I'm going to kill you' to Rob. She told the court that she pointed the gun upwards and didn't put her finger where the trigger was.   Chyna says she put a phone chord around Rob's neck 'as a joke', because 'he was playing video games and I was just trying to get his attention.'  December 15, 2016 - Chyna smashes a TV and a gingerbread house and damages the bedroom door. She said she was furious at Rob for taking her phone in a fit of jealousy and locking himself in a closet to check her messages.  Kris Jenner's boyfriend, Corey Gamble, shows up at Rob and Chyna's home. Chyna says that he stood between her and Rob, telling Rob to get his car keys and get out of the house.  Chyna leaves the home with daughter Dream that morning. January 2017 - Chyna says she and Rob hiked together in Malibu. Rob reportedly goes with her to New York for her personal appearance at a strip club, where cameras followed her.  Chyna said she was also filmed by hand-held cameras at another Las Vegas appearance, which made her think they were shooting Rob and Chyna's season two.  July/August 2017 - Chyna learns Rob and Chyna had actually been cancelled. October 2017 -  Chyna files a $108 million defamation suit against Kris Jenner and Kylie, Khloe and Kim Kardashian and accuses them of forcing producers to cancel her show.  Judge Gregory W. Alarcon made the decision on Thursday afternoon to move on to closing arguments. Chyna's attorney Lynne Ciani rested the plaintiff's case on Thursday morning.  The photo is central to another trial that will begin soon after this one concludes.  Chyna is suing Rob Kardashian over the image, alleging he posted it online out of retribution. Kris Jenner, Kylie Jenner and Khloe Kardashian were in the front row of the courtroom early on Thursday.  Kim Kardashian was absent after attending most of the nine-day trial. Alarcon began reading the jury instructions in the case late Thursday morning. Ciani wrapped up her case Thursday by showing jurors a video deposition from Frances Berwick, an executive with NBCUniversal, E!'s parent company. Berwick said that a second season of 'Rob & Chyna' didn't go ahead because 'their relationship broke down.' Berwick said: 'Their relationship was in a sad place and we didn't think that it was a good fit for E! - which is frothy and escapist, on the lighter side.' Berwick said she had not had a conversation with Kris Jenner in which Kris threatened to pull 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians' if season two of 'Rob & Chyna' went ahead. Asked why NBCUniversal issued a press release in December 2016 announcing a new season, she said that didn't mean the series had been 'greenlit' but that it was only 'an indication of what we hoped to do.' She added that 'it would not be the first time' a press release had come out announcing a show that did not go forward later.   Chyna appeared in court Thursday wearing a black check jacket, black leggings and black spike heels, with an orange jacket over the top. Khloe Kardashian was also in attendance and arrived wearing a black tuxedo jacket over a silk shirt, black leggings and white sneakers.  Her mother, Kris Jenner wore black pants and a black blazer with white piping. During cross examination last week Rhodes presented Chyna with a copy of the restraining order she filed in 2017 against her ex-fiance, Rob Kardashian after he allegedly posted 'revenge porn' photos of her on social media. Attached to the restraining order documents were copies of the offending nude pictures which both parties in the case had previously agreed by stipulation would not be shown to the jury. Jurors did not see them, but Chyna did, and allegedly became 'upset' and rattled by the photos. Chyna was so distressed that when Rhodes grilled her later about the amount of damages she is seeking, she couldn't name a dollar figure and only gave vague answers to other questions he asked about damages, her lawyer claimed. Seeing the pictures 'derailed' Chyna's testimony, Ciani told Judge Alarcon. 'There was a stipulation that the photos would not be included which was violated intentionally,' she added. Ciani asked the judge to order Chyna's previous testimony about damages to be stricken from the record and that she be allowed to take the witness stand again. Rhodes denied any wrongdoing, telling the court: 'The premise that I tricked the witness (Chyna) into seeing those photographs is absurd.' Rob Kardashian testified on Wednesday that he feared for his life on a night in 2016 when his then-fiancee Blac Chyna pointed a gun at his head, pulled a phone-charging cable around his neck and repeatedly hit him with a metal rod while under the influence of substances. 'She strangled me, she put a gun to my head twice, she was on cocaine and alcohol,' Kardashian said, his voice rising nearly to a shout in a Los Angeles courtroom as Chyna's attorney Lynne Ciani sought to cast doubt on the attack and its severity. During an emotional and contentious hour on the stand, Rob Kardashian grew angry when Ciani asked him why photos and video from the days that followed didn't show any marks on him, despite his testimony that she had hit him repeatedly with a 6-foot metal rod. 'Did you have as much as a Band-Aid on you?' the attorney asked. 'I just told you it didn't leave a mark on my face!' Rob Kardashian said.  'And the gun to my head two different times during the night didn't leave a mark to my temple!' Kris Jenner and Kim Kardashian watched the testimony from the front row of the gallery, and had no visible reaction. Chyna testified earlier in the trial that she was never violent toward Rob Kardashian. She said that on the night of Dec. 14 and the morning of Dec. 15, 2016, the couple had been celebrating the news that 'Rob & Chyna' was getting a second season. The all-night celebration turned into a bitter fight by morning, when he took her phone and shut himself in a closet, looking for evidence of communications with other men, she said. She testified that earlier in the evening, she had wrapped a phone-charging cord around Rob Kardashian's neck playfully because he was ignoring her, and picked up a gun he kept around, always unloaded, from a nightstand as a joke. The chain of events would lead to the end of the relationship, and their show. Rob Kardashian, 35, the youngest of Kris Jenner's four children with the late Robert Kardashian, has kept a much lower public profile than his mother and sisters.  He was mostly an offscreen character, and only occasionally appeared, on the family's reality show. He broke from the pattern in 2016, spending a year in the limelight before it went bad.  He and Chyna began dating in January, announced their engagement in April, announced they were having a child together in May, had their own reality show premiere in September, and had a daughter, Dream, in November. He testified Wednesday that he felt in retrospect that their love was never real, and that he had been at the 'weakest, worst point' in his life when their relationship began. He said the coupling was 'toxic' from the start, and that she beat him at least five times during the yearlong relationship. 'Strangling someone, beating someone, that's not a family,' he said.  'That's not love to me.' Rob Kardashian wore a loose-fitting, untucked black dress shirt on the stand.  His otherwise dark testimony drew a laugh from most of the courtroom when Ciani suggested that two videos she showed were shot on the same day because he was wearing the same thing. 'That doesn't mean anything,' he said. 'I wear the same thing every day.' Rob Kardashian is not a defendant in this trial.  Chyna's allegations against him, stemming from the same incidents, will get a separate trial when this one is done. Earlier on Wednesday, Corey Gamble, a key witness backing up Rob Kardashian's account of the assault, insisted that he saw Chyna punch him and whip him with a phone-charging cord, as Ciani tried to poke holes in his story.  'I said that she attacked him,' testified Gamble, the longtime boyfriend and sometime co-star of 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' matriarch Kris Jenner.  'What I saw is what I saw.' Gamble said he rushed to the house the couple was staying in after Kris Jenner got an early morning call from her son, who sounded deeply distressed. When he arrived, he said, Chyna was holding some sort of metal rod, and threw it down.  She rushed toward Rob Kardashian, whipping the phone cord at him then punching him. 'By the time she got to him, she started hitting him,' Gamble testified.  'I was able to get in the middle of them two. I even got hit two or three times.' Gamble said Chyna threw a chair at Rob Kardashian's car as he was leaving, then attempted to pick up a table but Gamble stopped her. During cross-examination, Ciani had Gamble read from a declaration he submitted in the case two years earlier, in which he said he arrived to find Chyna hitting Rob Kardashian with her fists, but made no mention of any of the objects. 'You didn't see sufficient to mention the metal rod, the cord or the table?' Ciani asked. 'I don't know why I didn't include those details,' Gamble said.",
  "e7728c7ce90edc5619b9edde07e24ba858cdae3fac736ada0eba9849": "A woman accused of kidnapping a three month-old baby befriended the infant's mom at church after noticing she was heavily pregnant, it was claimed. Carolina Ayala said that Yesenia Ramirez, 43, inveigled her way into her family's life after spotting her with the huge baby bump, and became a regular called to the family's San Diego home after Ayala's son Brandon was born. Ayala said: 'She would go to my house a lot, she always wanted to be there,' Ayala told KTST-TV, a Telemundo affiliate.  Brandon was snatched from his grandmother's home Monday by a man cops say is Jose Roman Portillo, 28. They allege Portillo was encouraged to carry out the abduction on Ramirez's orders. Brandon was discovered safe in a San Diego home on Tuesday, with Ramirez and Portillo both appearing in court Thursday charged with his abduction.  Ayala said she was at work cleaning a home when her sister-in-law called her on Monday, to let her know her child was missing. 'I felt like half of my heart had left with him. I felt like I died,' Ayala told KDTV-TV, a Univision affiliate. Authorities did not issue an Amber Alert because investigators did not have a vehicle description. In the early hours of the investigation, officers and FBI agents went door-to-door in the neighborhood to appeal for witnesses or information. Ayala was reunited with her son on Tuesday, after police found him in Portillo's home, and said it was like 'having my soul return to my body.' 'I cried out of joy, I cried until I got tired of crying,' she told Telemundo 48. Ayala said that Ramirez offered to buy supplies for the baby and drove the baby and his grandmother, Victoria Mejia, to the store and back home on Monday.  Her associate, Portillo, was captured on surveillance video carrying a baby car seat and a small blanket and walking toward the apartment, police said. Police said Ramirez had been communicating with Portillo moments before walked into the house while the grandmother was unloading the groceries, and took the baby and drove away. The motive for the kidnapping is still under investigation.  Ramirez, Portillo and Ramirez's husband Baldomeo Sandoval, 37, were arrested. Sandoval has since been released without charge.  'Baby Brandon has been located,' the San Diego police department tweeted on Tuesday, adding that he would be 'taken to a local hospital as a precaution but he has been located alive. 'A million thank yous to all who assisted.'   Sgt. Christian Camarillo from the San Jose Police Department said that Ramirez was a family friend, and that the kidnappers' motives are still under investigation.  'There is a human component aspect to this incident,' he said, according to ABC7.  'Mom is very traumatized right now. She needs her space.' Camarillo said on Monday that the baby's mother was at work at the time and his father is in jail. It's unclear why the father is in jail.  'Dad right now is out of the picture. He is incarcerated,' Camarillo said. 'I don't know, you know, whether that is going to play into this, but obviously we are going to talk to him soon.' ",
  "ad8b58759989d504b50aac8c19decd0dff3a376bfbaec622da5ee055": "Public Transport NSW is bidding an emotional farewell to the familiar green social distancing markers that have been scattered across train and bus seats for the last two years. The state government agency posted the news on social media on Friday and said the stickers would be done away with by Saturday. 'From April 30, after almost two years, we're saying goodbye to green dots on public transport,' the post said. 'Masks on public transport are still mandatory though.' The video is set to an emotional James Blunt song and features a transport worker peeling off the bright green sit-here stickers from a train seat. A transport worker stroked a sticker before slowly peeling it off and throwing it out of sight as the singer croons, 'I've been addicted to you, goodbye my lover, goodbye my friend'.  The post sparked some social media debate on if it was too early to remove the social distancing markers. 'It's too soon to remove both. I'm still going to refuse to let people sit next to me,' one joked, while another asked 'how will the passengers know where to sit now?'.  The post led another to celebrate, 'I cant wait [to] say goodbye to the green dots,' with one punter saying, 'back to normality'.  The randomly-placed stickers have been a fixture of pandemic life on Sydney's transport system, with its widespread use enforcing commuters to socially distance. Despite the green dots being scrapped, mask mandates on public transport still remain in place, despite many Aussies calling for the rule to end. 'Get rid of the masks now...hardly no one wears them anyway,' one said. Atop epidemiologist called on the whole country to be rid of mask and vaccine mandates last month. The Australian National University Professor Peter Collignon hit out against a study that claimed mass mask rules dramatically reduced the spread of the virus. He said both vaccine and mask mandates should be limited to the vulnerable aged care sector now Australia has such a high vaccination rate. 'When you've already got 94 per cent [of over 16s double vaccinated] - the question is 'do we need to go further?'' he told Daily Mail Australia in February.  In January former Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Nick Coatsworth forecasted the pandemic will end this year.  'The pandemic will come to an end in 2022 because the virus will become endemic, and that means that Covid will circulate in the community,' he said.  'We will live our lives again as part of the incredibly social and incurably optimistic human species that thrives on this planet,' Dr Coatsworth wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald.  'And has emerged from countless pandemics over history stronger and more capable of managing the next.'  'With a significant contribution from Australian science, COVID-19 is now the most treatable respiratory virus known to man.",
  "144547fcc85d6229c6318066bcb5676de1bf981b830349eee21be7d6": "An election candidate is being investigated by the Australian Federal Police after it emerged he was standing in two different seats in two different states for two different political parties. A man named Malcolm Heffernan is now on the ballot for the seat of Banks in NSW and the seat of Brand in Western Australia. In NSW Mr Heffernan in a One Nation candidate, while in WA he is standing for the Australian Federation Party.  Mr Heffernan, who is listed as a financial advisor, is now under investigation after allegedly using two different birthdays and two names to declare himself as a candidate for the election.  The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) announced on Friday it had referred Mr Heffernan to the Australian Federal Police for investigation on whether he has committed a crime under the Commonwealth Criminal Code. Candidates for the Federal election were formally 'declared' on April 22 at public events held across Australia, including Mr Heffernan in two different electorates. 'Each nomination form had a signed declaration that the candidate did not intend to be a candidate in any other election held the same day,' the AEC said in a statement about Mr Heffernan's forms.  'Each nomination form had differences in the listed information - including a different date of birth, and a different expression of the candidate's name.' Mr Heffernan's dual candidacy contravenes section 165 of the Electoral Act which, according to the AEC, renders him 'incapable of being elected'.  'However, candidate nominations for the Divisions of Banks and Brand must remain as they were formally declared on 22 April 2022.  'Ballot papers have been printed and some postal voters have already received their postal voting packs.' Mr Heffernan ran in the WA seat of Canning at the 2019 election for Fraser Anning's Conservative National Party, drawing 1,600 votes or 1.76 per cent of the total votes.  In an interview with a local paper before that election Mr Heffernan said he was a financial adviser and complained about 'the billions of dollars paid to the UN and in foreign aid' which 'could be better utilised at home in assisting the Australian people' Australian Federation Party director Mark Aldridge told The West Australian that Mr Heffernan's situation was 'a mix-up'. He claimed Mr Heffernan had initially nominated for One Nation in Banks but was then told the vacancy had been filled and he was no longer needed. 'We had his WA seat (Brand) available, I did a bit of research from him, found him to be half reasonable. and so we endorsed him and filed the paperwork correctly,' Mr Aldridge said the paper. 'At some stage later the One Nation paperwork was filed in NSW. The candidate himself wasn't aware of that and has supplied text messages supporting his belief he was free to run for us.' Australia heads to the polls on May 21, with postal and pre-poll voting opening from Monday, May 9.",
  "d9d3981d8ea70a205075658ac7e0766dbb3fdcd238d40a4f414d8f78": "Cat owners who let their felines roam outdoors could face hefty fines and risk having their beloved pets impounded if strict new laws are enforced in Western Australia. Perth's City of Bayswater Council has proposed to ban cats from 42 natural areas in a bold move designed to protect native wildlife and 'designated areas of environmental sensitivity'. The council will seek community feedback on the proposal after councillors vote to repel its current cat control laws this week. Cat owners would face a $250 fine and could have their cat seized or impounded if their moggy is found in a prohibited zone under the proposed laws. They would face the same penalty if their cat is found in a public place and not under effective control. It has no plans at this stage to introduce cat curfew times or containment  recognition of 'potential community opposition and the practical aspects of enforcement', the council report states Browns Lake Reserve, Gobba Lake, Riverside Gardens and Nora Hughes wetlands are among dozens of 'environmental sensitive' site that would be off-limits to cats. The issue of cat control sparked debate at Tuesday's council meeting, Perth Now reported. 'If we get support for this, I advocate the state government actually do this - they're dragging their heels and community attitudes around cats have changed with a lot of local governments trying to achieve something along these lines,' Cr Giorgia Johnson said. Cr Sally Palmer described cats as 'tiny killing machines'. 'Pet cats kill 30 to 50 times more animals per kilometre than feral cats do in a bush,' she said. 'We need to look hard and take the courage and responsibility to accept their behaviour.' But Cr Lorna Clarke had reservations the proposed laws may be 'outside the scope of legislation'. 'It would be useful once this has been consulted on and its comes back to council for council to ask about confidential legal advice from the City which sets out some assurance that we're still within the legal power that is set under the Cat Act,' she said. The council currently has no prohibited zones for cats. 'There are many parks and wetland areas within the City which are refuges for wildlife including birds and reptiles,' its website states. 'To help protect native wildlife please ensure your cat is not straying from your property, particularly at night.",
  "cb69d1068d5088581db185f509f0c5253fe14776cfdee239858e2e81": "Anthony Albanese's first day back on the campaign trail has been marred by a Twitter blunder and a live television smackdown by Today Show host Ally Langdon.  The Labor leader shared a picture of his beloved cavoodle, Toto, watching on as he did a series of live crosses to the ABC and the Nine Network's Today Show on Friday morning.  However, the picture was swiftly deleted from social media as it clearly showed the wannabe prime minister's phone number on the dog's collar. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Labor for comment over the deleted tweet. It comes as the Labor leader emerged from isolation after spending the last week isolating at home with the virus - but if he thought he was in for an easy ride with the TV hosts, he was sorely mistaken.  Mr Albanese was grilled on Friday morning about the rising cost of living as inflation hits a 21-year high at 5.1 per cent.  The Opposition Leader said he had been doing some online shopping in quarantine and noted the cost of an iceberg lettuce is now $5.50. He was abruptly interrupted by Today co-host Allison Langdon. 'I don't think people want to hear politicians telling us what the problem is anymore,' she said.  'People are living this every day.' 'They know what the problem is. They want to know how you are going to fix it!' Briefly taken off guard, Mr Albanese insists Labor will fix the issue by plan to address wages while taking a swipe at the Coalition government. 'This government won't even put in submissions supporting a wage increase for aged care workers,' he said. 'We will lift productivity through the national reconstruction fund, by having the NBN operate properly to lift the productivity of businesses, and then the way you can place better profits and better wages.' 'The only way you can do that without placing pressure on inflation is by making sure you have those productivity improvements, and we are aiming at that as well.' Mr Albanese doubled down on his attack of the Coalition over living costs on ABC's News Breakfast.  'We need an economic plan so the economy works for people, not the other way around,' he said. 'This government are happy to claim credit any time something goes right but as soon as things don't, they look to blame someone else and not accept responsibility.  'We will accept responsibility. We will step up and recognise that people are doing it tough.' Earlier, the Labor leader took to Twitter to express his delight to be out of quarantine. 'Out of iso and back at it,' he captioned a photo with Toto before sharing a clip of the cavoodle racing around an oval after a week of being cooped up at home. 'I'm not the only one excited to be out,' he added. It comes amid murmurs that Mr Albanese was somewhat upstaged by his own frontbenchers while off sick.  Campaign spokesman Jason Clare impressed Labor voters and commentators with his strong performance in front of the cameras while Mr Albanese was in isolation.   Mr Albanese will fly to Perth later on Friday ahead of the official launch of Labor's campaign on Sunday.  He told the Today show  he feels 'terrific' after the virus knocked him around. However, he said he isn't in a rush to make up for lost time just three weeks out from the May 21 election. 'It just means being sensible. So, it means if I feel really tired, have a rest,' he said. 'It means doing, perhaps, less things during the day.  'But I expect and the doctors' advice is I'll get better each day and certainly today I feel terrific this morning, and I feel better than I did yesterday and yesterday I felt better than I did the day before. That's what happens.' By Charlie Moore, Political Reporter for Daily Mail Australia Jason Clare has received lavish praise yet again after another impressive media performance - but the odds of him one day becoming Prime Minister are stacked against him. The frontbench Labor MP made headlines last week for his impeccable communication skills in daily press conferences, with many supporters wishing he was leader instead of Anthony Albanese. The cries for him to take over stepped up again on Thursday after he expertly handled a lively media pack and prompted laughter with a witty joke at the expense of Liberal minister Alan Tudge. 'I don't think Scooby-doo could find Alan Tudge at the moment,' he said as Mr Tudge remains away from the limelight after being cleared of abusing his former staffer.  Twitter went into meltdown once again, with supporters and journalists heaping praise on the 50-year-old father of two from western Sydney. 'Loving Jason Clare's media conferences so much,' one user wrote.  'Jason Clare is on fire,' said another who praised his 'wit and humour'.  Mr Clare has also been described as handsome, and even Mr Albanese admitted: 'Jason Clare is certainly better looking than I am. There is no question about that.' But despite his strong performances, the odds of Mr Clare becoming the next Labor leader are long. Tanya Plibersek is favourite at $2.10 followed by Jim Chalmers at $3.75, Kristina Keneally at $6.50 and then Mr Clare at $8, according to Sportsbet. If he wanted to become leader in the event that Labor loses and Mr Albanese resigns, Mr Clare would likely face a messy factional struggle. As a member of the right faction of the NSW division he may have to see off challenges from Shadow Energy Minister Chris Bowen or Shadow Attorney-General Tony Burke who are in the same faction. And then he would be up against Tanya Plibersek who is a leading figure in the NSW Left faction - even before challengers from other states like Mr Chalmers and Richard Marles are considered. Ever since he came to Parliament in 2007, Mr Clare has played down his desire to become leader and those close to him say he is focussed on being a good MP and father. Mr Clare told Sky News in 2014: 'I might be touted but I have no desire to do that job at all' and revealed his 'dream job' would be minister for education.  'For me I feel like I am part of the team and not the leader of the team,' he said. However, Labor sources speaking on the condition of anonymity told Daily Mail Australia that him playing down his ambitions could simply be a smart strategy to win over voters. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern played down her ambitions before she became Labour Party leader seven weeks before the 2017 election. Other Labor sources said Mr Clare's excellent performances have put him front and centre of his colleagues' minds as a future leadership candidate. But right now Mr Clare is focussed on helping Mr Albanese kick out Scott Morrison. Asked last week why he was not in charge, he replied: 'The short answer is Anthony Albanese is the leader this country desperately needs.'  ",
  "871bbae6a09888a7633fd9f296efef048a22272196f2bc49ba63fc09": "Elon Musk sold 4.4 million shares of Tesla valued at nearly $4 billion, according to filings with the Security Exchange Commission.  The sale in shares, which were conducted on Tuesday and Wednesday, was coupled with the stock of the electric vehicle company plummeting 20 percent, with Musk, the company's CEO, simply tweeting on Thursday, 'No further TSLA sales planned for today.' The sale comes as Musk, the world's richest man, goes forward with his plan to purchase Twitter for $44 billion.  According to the SEC filings, Musk, who owned 17 percent of Tesla, made the sales at prices between $870 and $1,000 per share.  Musk had staked $12.5 billion of his ownership in Tesla as collateral to purchase Twitter, with his commitment to take over the social media platform causing an earlier drop in Tesla stock as investors feared he will be too preoccupied with his latest acquisition.  Analyst Dan Ives, of Wedbush Securities, said that Musk's focus on Twitter and the recent sell of Tesla stocks was foreboding for the future of the electric vehicle company.  'It's a brutal cycle for Tesla investors to navigate and casts a shadow on the name with Musk selling more stock,' Ives told Bloomberg. 'The Twitter deal is becoming an albatross for Tesla's stock and this pours gasoline on the raging fire.' The 12 percent fall on Tuesday, when Musk began offloading his shares, represented the biggest fall in Tesla shares since September 2020.  Musk intends to buy Twitter using the stake in Tesla, coupled with a $13 billion buyout loan from lenders and his own personal assets of $21 billion. According to SEC filings on Tuesday, Musk would owe a $1 billion termination fee if he fails to secure enough funding to complete the deal. Twitter, however, could owe Musk a $1 billion break-up fee if it accepts a competing offer or if shareholders reject the deal.    The release of the SEC filings on Thursday came as Twitter failed to meet revenue estimates in what may be one of its final quarterly earnings reports as a public company.  The social media company said revenue for the first quarter totaled $1.2 billion - a 16 percent increase from last year but less than the $1.23 billion that Wall Street analysts had expected.  However, San Francisco-based Twitter reported an average of 229 million daily active users in the quarter, up 16 percent from last year in a positive sign of growth. Twitter canceled the conference call with executives and industry analysts that usually accompanies its results, so there will be little further insight into the company's current financial condition. 'Given the pending acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk, we will not be providing any forward looking guidance, and are withdrawing all previously provided goals and outlook,' the company said in a statement. It comes as Twitter employees have warned of a 'mass exodus' of staff when Musk takes over the company, with one describing the world's richest man as 'a person with questionable ethics'. Staff on Monday were invited to an 'all-hands' meeting via videolink, hosted by CEO Parag Agrawal and Bret Taylor, the chair of the board. Questions submitted by staff during the 45-minute meeting were read out by the chief marketing officer, Leslie Berland. One question asked in a recording obtained by Project Veritas was: 'How does the board and Mr Musk plan on dealing with a mass exodus considering the acquisition is by a person with questionable ethics?' Taylor replied that 'one of the themes of today is continuity'. He said: 'The question of attrition: As Parag stated, one of the themes of today is continuity, and ensuring that Parag and this leadership team continues to operate the business successfully on behalf of our users, on behalf of our customers, and that has obviously been a big topic of discussion at the board.  'And as I mentioned, an area that is important to Elon Musk as well, because of the importance of Twitter as a service.' Agrawal said he had seen many questions about the process, about share schemes, and about working conditions in the future. He said much was still to be clarified. Staff were told there would be no layoffs 'at this time' - but no guarantees were provided when Musk takes over. Elon Musk hinted on Thursday that his political sentiment has shifted rightward over the past 14 years, by posting a meme showing a moderate liberal driven into the arms of conservatives. The image depicts a stick figure labeled 'me' remaining stationary relative to another labeled 'conservative', as the figure at the 'liberal' end of the spectrum moves further and further to the left. By the final diagram, labeled 2021, the 'me' figure is to the right of the center line, as the conservative chuckles and the liberal - now labeled 'woke progressive' - accuses the centrist of bigotry. Musk shared the post without comment, but his political views have taken on new significance after his $44billion deal to buy Twitter and his declaration the platform should be 'politically neutral'. Responding to his tweet, many angry liberals claimed conservatives had grown more extreme since 2008, the year Barack Obama was first elected president. Since his takeover was announced Monday, Musk, whose political views are elusive and sometimes contradictory, stepped up his engagement with conservatives, responding to the tweets of several right-wing commentators. Meanwhile, conservative influencers have enjoyed a considerable uptick in Twitter followers since the deal was announced, while public figures on the left of the political spectrum suffered a sharp decrease. Fox News host Tucker Carlson, Donald Trump Jr. and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis - three of America's most forthright conservative mouthpieces - have experienced an influx of 175,960, 301,570 and 286,559 followers respectively since the news of Musk's takeover broke earlier this week. Meanwhile on the left, Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez (AOC), Hillary Clinton and Ellen DeGeneres have witnessed an exodus of 26,072, 21,424 and 27,141 Twitter followers respectively in the past four days. Vice President Kamala Harris lost over 28,000 of her supporters and Michelle Obama dropped a dramatic 32,073, while her husband Barack and US President Joe Biden appeared to be the only big-name Democrats who saw their numbers increase. The fluctuation in follower numbers on either side triggered a wave of conspiracy theories seeking to explain the phenomenon. Some suggested Elon's takeover prompted developers to change the social media behemoth's algorithms to highlight conservative accounts and suppress left-leaning ones - a theory that was slapped down by people who pointed out that Musk will not officially complete his purchase of the platform for months. Others argued 'woke' Twitter programmers, who have been accused of silencing right-wing voices by suspending or banning controversial accounts whose views they disagree with, adjusted the algorithms to be more balanced in an attempt to cover up their previous biases.  But Twitter blocked its staff from making programming changes to the app to prevent it being sabotaged, rendering that theory wide of the mark as well. Now, social media expert and digital marketeer Carrie-Ann Sudlow has declared the phenomenon which has seen conservative influencers gain followers since Musk's takeover while left wingers lose out as an organic consequence of the way in which different users view the SpaceX and Tesla founder. 'It's not an algorithm issue or a conspiracy. When something like this happens in the world, [conservative influencers] have an opinion on it, and it's either popular or not popular and that leads to them gaining or losing followers,' she told DailyMail.com. 'This is a big takeover from a very influential man. With influence comes strong opinions. Elon fans seem to be for or against, with few sitting on the fence. He's making a big impact on all areas of the world, his sceptics will not want to fund him and so they leave Twitter. 'His supporters meanwhile will rejoice and jump on the back of the news, hence gaining followers.' Her analysis of the phenomenon seems to validate Twitter's own statement, which said the loss and gain of followers was down to supporters of Elon Musk and conservative influencers creating more accounts, while left-leaning users deactivated theirs. 'While we continue to take action on accounts that violate our spam policy which can affect follower counts, these fluctuations appear to largely be a result of an increase in new account creation and deactivation,' the platform said in a statement.  Twitter's board on Monday unanimously accepted a $44billion bid from Musk to buy out the company and own it outright.   Musk pledged to uphold free speech on the platform so it can fulfil its potential as the world's 'digital town square', while relaxing content restrictions and cracking down on spam posters and bots. 'Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,' Musk said in a statement following the announcement of his takeover. But news of the buyout prompted many left-leaning users to announce their intentions to leave the platform, while others expressed concern that relaxed content controls could lead to more hate speech. In yet more tweets last night and early this morning, Elon set out some more of his intentions for the platform which outlined his basic visions for the user experience, a desire to make Twitter politically neutral in its content control, and the need for increased security. Donald Trump Jr, who has 7.7 million followers, saw his followers surge by 87,296 on Tuesday alone - the day following the takeover announcement - and posited the now disproven theory the increase was due to an algorithm tweak targeting prominent conservative voices ahead of Musk's arrival. He tweeted: 'While I'm awesome and totally deserving of 87,000 new followers a day it seems that someone took the shackles off my account. Wonder if they're burning the evidence before new management comes in.' Don Jr's account had grown by between 5,000 and 10,000 tweets a day in recent weeks, with the spike in the wake of Musk's announcement immediately obvious.   Florida Governor Ron DeSantis praised Musk's bid for Twitter, calling it 'a good deal for shareholders' and saying it 'raises the prospect that the platform will be a place where free speech can thrive, not a tool for narrative enforcement.' Conservative talk show host Dana Loesch, who's long complained of account suppression, also saw her followers surge by about 9,000 on Tuesday. By comparison, she was gaining a few hundred new followers a day prior to Musk's acquisition.    Meanwhile AOC, arguably the left's most prominent voice, particularly among millennials and generation Z, has seen her follower count tumble.   Prior to Musk buying Twitter, she attracted around 1,000 new followers each day, but news of the takeover appears to have inspired many of her leftist followers to abandon the platform.  Ocasio-Cortez's fellow progressive 'squad' member - Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota - saw her followers slump by 10,097 on Tuesday alone. That is in contrast to the hundreds or even thousands of new followers she previously gained on any given day. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the abrasive Georgia representative, saw her tally rise by 41,181 on Tuesday, while her friend Matt Gaetz, the firebrand Florida congressman, went up 24,929. Taylor Greene tweeted a list of those currently banned for spreading misinformation or 'inciting violence' under Twitter's current management, arguing the platform was suppressing right-leaning voices and infringing on the right to free speech.  'Bring back President Trump,' she said. 'Bring back my personal account. Bring back Dr. Robert Malone. Bring back Alex Jones. 'Bring back Milo Yiannopoulos. Bring back the cancelled nation. Bring back freedom of speech. 'Bring back America!' Twitter today reported overall revenue and ad sales that fell short of expectations, hurt by the ongoing war in Ukraine, laying out the challenges Musk will face if he takes over the social media company. Although it reported stronger-than-expected user growth in what could be the last quarter as a public company, Twitter shares fell slightly. 'Elon Musk is buying Twitter at a time when the company is struggling to attract new users following the pandemic-driven surge,' said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing.com. To put Twitter's user growth in perspective, the sequential addition of 12 million users in the first quarter is the biggest since the height of the pandemic. Since then, it has not come near that level and has ranged between 1 million to 7 million new users per quarter, after growing by 20 million daily active users in the second quarter of 2020. The company would need to add at least 12 million users every quarter until the end of next year to achieve the ambitious 2023 goals it set for itself, which Twitter has now disavowed because of the deal. 'We think macro issues will take [Twitter] further away from its previously-stated 2023 goals,' said Angelo Zino, analyst at CFRA Research. 'We believe results along with ongoing ad related industry headwinds solidify the Board's decision to approve the Musk offer, as we see little reason to believe (Twitter) could extract greater shareholder value remaining public.' Twitter has long faced criticism for its sluggish pace of product launches. Musk has tweeted suggestions ranging from releasing a widely-demanded edit button to making the Twitter algorithm open-source. When Musk closes the deal, he will be overseeing a company that has had long-standing struggles with internal dysfunction, indecision and lack of accountability, as stated by a series of current and former Twitter employers interviewed by Reuters. Daily active users on Twitter rose to 229 million in the first quarter ended March 31, from 199 million a year earlier. The figure beat analyst expectations of 226.8 million daily active users.",
  "add9ef7829f4553bf473b0200091f52e065b57cceec6289338d18588": "Pet owners are up in arms after a series of cats were spray-painted in a bizarre spate of attacks in a regional area.  The attacks, which occurred near the town of Wangaratta, Victoria, saw the household pets brazenly sprayed with aerosol paint.  The issue has sparked concern from a leading animal rights advocate, who says not enough is being done by governments to fight animal cruelty.  Emma Hurst, a member of NSW Legislative Council, said: 'It is disgusting that a member of the public would harm an animal in this way.'  She argued the enforcement of animal cruelty laws is 'drastically underfunded' by the state government.  Ms Hurst claimed the animal protection enforcement bodies in NSW receive less than half a million dollars a year to uphold animal cruelty rules.   'That's less than $500,000 to protect every animal in NSW,' she said.  Ms Hurst said the lack of funding made it difficult for these charities to respond to, investigate and prosecute every act of animal cruelty. Hotlines aren't being staffed 24/7, she said. Ms Hurst said 'spray paints and dyes are toxic, and can be very harmful to animals especially when sprayed into the face, eyes, nose and mouth.'  'In NSW it is an offence to commit an act of cruelty on an animal - this includes any act which unnecessarily inflicts pain on an animal.'  'Anyone who sees evidence of animal cruelty should immediately report it to the police, the RSPCA, or the Animal Welfare League NSW.' The incident comes after a similar incident involving a white cockatoo spray-painted green in June last year.   Bruno Bouchet saw the bird in a flock of about 30 cockatoos at Campbelltown Train Station in Sydney's south-west in June last year. Colourful cockatoos have been spotted around Sydney in recent previous years, but painting or dyeing a bird in NSW could put you behind bars for six months. ",
  "338b1298cc01940c92b79b0edbecffa5aed7e2a72af7ab68a1421ea5": "Liberal election candidate Katharine Deves has declared she is not transphobic and can still win despite the controversial start to her campaign. Prime Minister Scott Morrison's 'captain's pick' for the Sydney northern beaches seat of Warringah has told Ben Fordham on 2GB that despite being attacked for her comments on trans people participating in women's sport, she has never contemplated quitting. 'I believe this is very much an issue of equality and fairness and I have received messages of support from all over Australia,' she said. 'Australians are very much on side with my position.'  Fordham mentioned Ms Deves had arrived at the 2GB studios flanked by security guards as she faced death threats as a result of her old social media posts. Ms Deves said she had 'drawn strength' from meeting people in the electorate during the campaign as she battled intense criticism.  'I don't look at it. I have a great supportive team around me so I can concentrate on the job,' she said of the 'pile-on' she had received as a result of her stance. She said she got involved in the issue of trans people in sport because she has three little girls who play different sports. 'I saw that little girls and young women should have someone standing up representing their interests and all I ever wanted was for this debate to be held in the public domain. Fordham asked Ms Deves directly whether she was transphobic. 'Oh of course not, Ben,' she responded.  'This isn't about (transphobia), this argument is about women and girls.  'Back in the early 1990s I was going to Mardi Gras, I voted for same-sex marriage, I don't have an issue with that but this is about a collision of rights and we just need to be able to debate it in a respectful way.' Ms Deves also said she could still win Warringah.  'I wouldn't have stood up if I didn't believe I had a chance to win,' she said.   In the wake of Ms Deves' comments, there have been multiple calls for Ms Deves to be disendorsed, including by prominent Liberals North Sydney MP Trent Zimmerman and NSW Treasurer Matt Kean. Ms Deves faces an uphill battle to reclaim Warringah for the Liberals, with the former blue-ribbon seat currently held by independent MP Zali Steggall by more than seven per cent. Ms Steggall was $1.04 favourite to win the seat while Ms Deves is at $9, according to the most recent Sportsbet odds.  Ms Deves has become a divisive figure following a number of provocative comments on her Twitter account - which she has since deleted. She once declared trans teenagers are 'surgically mutilated' and felt personally 'triggered' by the rainbow Pride flag. The Warringah candidate also bizarrely linked cross-dressing males and and trans women to 'sexual predators, even serial killers'. 'Transvestism is very common among sexual predators, even serial killers,' she said in a historical tweet. 'So how are we women supposed to tell the difference between the ones who are a threat and the ones who aren't? Easier for women to exclude all males from spaces where we are vulnerable.' Last September Ms Deves described the prospect of two gay men having a baby as a 'vanity project.' 'Surrogacy is a human rights violation,' she tweeted. 'Women's bodies are not vehicles for a vanity project.' Ms Deves was referring to Pete Buttigieg, the first openly gay U.S. presidential candidate, and his husband, who are joint fathers of twin girls. In another tweet, Ms Deves said 'transablism' - where trans people pretend to be disabled - is 'a thing' and likened people in that category to a well-known serial killer. Mr Morrison subsequently defended her as the party's candidate as she received a torrent of online abuse over the comments. 'She is standing up for women and girls and their access to fair sport in this country,' the PM said. 'She has learned in her advocacy in her private life there are better ways to do things to take things forward as a Member of Parliament. 'I believe that is how she will approach the task if she is elected as the member for Warringah, and I don't think she should be silenced.'",
  "1d2dba294c4aa453faf6f0ba857134fbf5116d04b3a30249a8a1a416": "Feared underworld trigger man George Marrogi will spend at least 27 years behind bars for the cold blooded public execution of a drug rival.  Marrogi, 33, was on Friday sentenced in the Supreme Court of Victoria to a total of 32 years in jail - all of which he is likely to serve going off his alleged bad behaviour behind bars.  It took three gruelling trials for a jury to finally convict Marrogi of the 2016 murder of drug dealer Kadir Ors, who was riddled with bullets in the execution-style hit in broad daylight.  In what would be Justice Paul Coghlan's last ever sentence as a Supreme Court of Victoria judge, the retiring justice said Marrogi had shown no remorse for the murder and continued to maintain his innocence.  'This is one of the most blatant examples of murder I have ever seen,' Justice Coghlan said.  Marrogi, who was born in Iraq and migrated to Australia in 1996, has already spent most of his life behind bars, having been sentenced to a minimum of six years for manslaughter as a youth.   He had been charged with murder after he got involved in a wild brawl in 2005 in which he stabbed and killed a man.  On release he continued to offend and was later jailed for arson.  Five months later he would be charged with murder for a second time - this time it would stick.   In total, Marrogi has spent 15 of last the 16 years behind bars, missing his own sister's funeral just six months ago.  Upon hearing the sentence, Marrogi directed a spray at the detective who had finally brought him to justice.  Ors, 24, had been lured to a meeting with Marrogi unaware that his number was about to be punched.  CCTV captured from a carpark in Campbellfield, 13km north of Melbourne, showed Marrogi stalking his prey, who was accompanied by two mates.  The court heard Marrogi chased down Ors, ignoring his friends altogether, before catching up with Ors outside an Officeworks.  Marrogi shot his terrified victim seven times, hitting him in the back, leg, hip and buttocks.  After blasting Ors, Marrogi made a wild escape from the scene as two of the dead man's mates pursued him in another vehicle.  Even then, the ruthless killer fired even more shots at Ors as he lay bleeding out on the footpath.  Police would later determine Marrogi had fired 13 rounds during the hit.  In scenes emulating a Hollywood movie, the tyres of Marrogi's Commodore were blasted out by his pursuers, forcing him to pull over in Broadmeadows.  Undeterred, Marrogi exited the stricken vehicle and took aim at his pursuers, firing off another four rounds in their direction.  While Marrogi escaped the chaos, police found the empty box of the bullets in the abandoned Commodore which Marrogi had sprayed all over Melbourne's northern suburbs. The gunman had also left his DNA on the box and the car was quickly linked directly back to a childhood mate of Marrogi.  Police had also claimed a hoodie worn by the shooter was purchased the same day, and a receipt for a similar item of clothing was found at Marrogi's home.  The killer's barrister had successfully puzzled two juries over the crucial DNA evidence, which he claimed had been transferred onto the incriminating bullet box by someone else.  Marrogi had been playing a dangerous game leading up to the murder, with police already suspecting him of being the triggerman that shot Nabil 'Mad Lebo' Maghnie just months earlier.  Maghnie would be shot and killed while Marrogi was still behind bars fighting the Ors assassination.  A third jury, who sat through a 16-day trial, would have no doubt it was Marrogi behind Ors' murder.  It was a solid call.  On Monday it was revealed Marrogi had done little to reform his passion for crime while awaiting sentence.  Marrogi has been allegedly running his gang, Notorious Crime Family, from the confines of Barwon Prison - one of Australia's toughest jails.  Police allege Marrogi was allegedly setting up drug deals from Barwon Prison while pretending to be on the phone with his lawyer, the Herald Sun reported this week. On Wednesday, it was revealed Marrogi and his cohorts had allegedly planned another assassination for this very weekend, which was thwarted.   Acting Deputy Commissioner Bob Hill said the syndicate had access to military-style weapons, illicit drugs and unexplained wealth. He said the alleged murder plot was disrupted by state and federal police after receiving credible information that members of the syndicate intended to kill someone this weekend. ",
  "e295799f04c660770405925ae0d8f7444110b1c7d6fd0e34dc5cbcce": "A former U.S. Marine jailed in Russia on what he claims are trumped-up spy charges has demanded to know why his release was not secured in the prisoner swap that freed Trevor Reed. 'Why was I left behind? While I am pleased Trevor is home with his family, I have been held on a fictitious charge of espionage for 40 months,' Paul Whelan said Wednesday in a statement obtained by CNN. 'The world knows this charge was fabricated. Why hasn't more been done to secure my release?'  Whelan, 52, was arrested on espionage charges in December 2018 after being detained at a Moscow hotel. Despite vehemently denying the allegations, the ex-Marine was convicted June 2020 and sentenced to 16 years in prison in a trial that U.S. officials have denounced as 'unfair'. The prisoner's plea came after Reed, also an ex-Marine, was freed by the Kremlin on an airport tarmac in Ankara, Turkey, in exchange for Russian pilot Konstantin Yaroshenko. Reed was convicted in Russia in 2019 of endangering the lives of two police officers while drunk on a visit to Moscow. The U.S. called his trial a 'theater of the absurd.' Yaroshenko was arrested by American special forces in Liberia in 2010 and convicted of conspiracy to smuggle cocaine into the U.S. Russia had proposed a swap for the pilot in July 2019 in exchange for any American prisoner. The U.S. government claims they are working to free other Americans currently detained in Russia, including Whelan and WNBA player Brittney Griner, who was arrested in February after a vape pen filled with hash oil was found in her luggage at the Moscow airport. Whelan learned of the swap, and his continued detainment, on Wednesday by hearing it on a Russian TV network, according to his sister, Elizabeth Whelan. 'He was very upset,' Elizabeth told CNN. She claims their family was notified early Wednesday morning that 'Trevor was coming back and Paul was not.' 'I had barely time to alert my parents and brothers when it was all over the news,' Elizabeth said, noting she 'was unhappy that we were given so little time to absorb this bad news.' She also shared how their family, specifically her parents, was 'devastated, completely crushed' by the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs' decision to leave Whelan behind.   'When I had a virtual call with the SPEHA group later that day I let them know in no uncertain terms what I thought of the administration's terrible decision to leave Paul behind,' Elizabeth told the television network.  'I expect to continue communication with State and the NSC on an extremely regular basis until Paul is returned also.' The detainee's brother, David Whelan, also weighed, arguing that President Joe Biden's administration 'has engaged in far greater outreach with our family, and with the families of other hostages, than the Trump administration did' and said he is 'confident President Biden cares and his team is making an effort.' 'Unfortunately, that wasn't enough for Paul,' David said. 'Perhaps someday it will be.'  'I am glad that President Biden reiterated this morning his vow to bring Paul home. Because otherwise it feels as though his pledge 'not to walk away' from Paul, given last summer in Geneva, feels hollow today.' The State Department, in a statement to CNN, confirmed 'the case of Paul Whelan is one we continue to work day in, day out.' 'Paul Whelan is wrongfully detained in Russia,' spokesperson Ned Price said. 'Roger Carstens and his team continue to do everything we can to seek his release from Russian custody.' The White House also claimed officials are working to secure Whelan's release but declined to provide any details into the negotiations.  'Obviously, our objective continues to bring Paul Whelan home, and any American who is not with their family and is being detained overseas,' Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday. 'But I'm just not going to get into more details because I want to maintain the protection of our process.'  She also resisted the suggestion that Yaroshenko's release 'narrows the chances' of Whelan's release. 'We will continue to advocate for the immediate and unconditional release of Paul at every opportunity, and using wrongful detention as a bargaining chip represents a threat to the safety of everyone traveling, working and living abroad,' she said. Reed, 30, of North Texas, arrived back in the U.S. on Thursday after being freed in the swap, with officials saying his 'spirit is strong.' The swap, which some have likened to a famed Cold War prisoner exchange on the so-called Bridge of Spies, was caught on camera. The footage shows Yaroshenko disembark an American private jet, accompanied by security personnel, and walk towards Russian officials waiting nearby with Reed. Reed is seen stepping out of the plane with Russian officials as they make their way to the center of the runway, where American officials are waiting.  The Marine was seen walking with an agent and carrying two bags while Yaroshenko carried a single bag and what appeared to be a manila envelope.  As the Russian and American agents meet, the agent with the bags is seen escorting Reed directly to the American plane as Yaroshenko waits while the officials talk. The Americans and Russians are then seen shaking hands before the U.S. agents escort Reed to their plane.  U.S. Representative August Pfluger of Texas said Reed arrived at a San Antonio airport in the predawn hours. Pfluger posted pictures of the arrival on Twitter, with one showing the congressman making a thumbs-up gesture standing next to Reed. Other photos showed Reed standing with his parents and loved ones at the airport. 'The joy on their face, to see their son - obviously very worried about his health,' said congressional hearing with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday. 'And it's going to take some time to heal, to get back to good health. But his spirit is strong. He's a fighter. He's a survivor.' 'The reunification with his family was just tremendous,' Pfluger added. Reed's parents, Joey and Paula, now say their 'prayers have been answered,' telling CNN New Day host Brianna Keilar: 'Obviously, we're ecstatic.'  The swap was not part of broader diplomatic talks and did not represent an American change in approach on Ukraine, according to U.S. officials.  Russian-American relations have been at their worst since the Cold War era following Russia's February 24 invasion of Ukraine and subsequent Western sanctions imposed on Moscow. Russian news agencies reported that Yaroshenko landed back in Moscow on Wednesday and was reunited with his wife and daughter. Yaroshenko said on Thursday he had been tortured in custody in Liberia before his extradition to America. The pilot also claimed he had been beaten at a military base in the United States, an allegation rejected by the White House. Russian news agencies reported on April 4 that Reed had ended a hunger strike and was being treated in his prison's medical center.   Reed's parents said at the time that he had been exposed to an inmate with tuberculosis in December.  The prison service said Reed tested negative for tuberculosis.",
  "80695481034d1e8174e4f66a03ae754e619f0a5a10eef001ac02ace9": "An aspiring politician wants to ban obese Australians from purchasing products containing white sugar or refined flour as part of a plan to combat obesity. Liberal National Party candidate Nicole Tobin, who also works as a teacher, agreed with a social media post that claimed obese people 'shouldn't be able to purchase anything containing white sugar or refined flour'. 'And no soft drink if your BMI is over 30 either,' she wrote. 'Water or one glass of red wine.' Ms Tobin is running for the senate in Queensland for the Liberal National Party from an unwinnable spot at number six on the ticket. The teacher also told NewsCorp that she could always spot the lunchboxes of children who were overweight, because they were filled with Tiny Teddies and muffins from Coles and Woolies. 'And I know parents are busy. I'm not saying I never sent my children with packaged food, but the ones who consistently have packaged food are the ones that you know, they don't always make the good choices. ' The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows that 25 per cent of children aged five to 17, and 67 per cent of adults are overweight or obese. Ms Tobin says she only allows her children to drink soft drinks when competing in cross-country running events. She only drinks them herself on election day, because she 'needs the sugar'. 'I do think that people's doctors should definitely be saying to them, I'm sorry. You need to cut down on things. It's that simple.' Her comments follow Australia's top doctors calling for a sugar tax on sweetened drinks to help tackle obesity, heart disease, diabetes and strokes to save billions in health costs. The Australian Medical Association wants a tax of 40 cents per 100 grams of sugar which would increase the price of sweetened drinks by an average of 20 per cent.  The World Health Organisation says a 20 per cent increase is the minimum required to stop people buying them. The tax would increase the cost of a 375ml can of coca cola with 40g of sugar by 16 cents and a 500ml can of Rockstar: Super Sours Energy Drink with 65g of sugar by 26 cents. The AMA estimates the tax would raise $814million a year - which could be spent on tackling obesity - and result in 16,000 fewer cases of type 2 diabetes, 4,400 fewer cases of heart disease and 1,100 fewer strokes over 25 years. The tax would reduce obesity by two per cent and save taxpayers up to $1.73 billion on healthcare costs, the AMA says. 'It could save lives, and save millions of dollars in healthcare costs,' said AMA president Dr Omar Khorshid. More than 2.4 billion litres of sugary drinks are consumer every year in Australia, enough fill 960 Olympic sized swimming pools. Dr Khorshid said they have 'no nutritional value' and fuel diabetes, obesity and poor vascular health which are 'huge contributors to the burden on our health system. 'The tax on sugary drinks sends a clear price signal to consumers that a product is unhealthy and makes it less affordable,' he said 'It can also nudge manufacturers to reformulate their products to contain less sugar. 'The added bonus is that it will generate revenue to rekindle our nation's preventative health agenda,' Dr Khorshid said. The AMA recommends the Commonwealth ultimately expands the tax to 'incorporate other products that have little or no nutritional benefit, and/or high sugar content'. Several jurisdictions around the world already have a sugar tax including the UK, Mexico, France, Chile and some US cities. The UK scheme targeted at soft drinks prompted half of drink manufactures to reduce the sugar content of their products to avoid the tax in the two years after it was announced in 2016. However, critics have slammed the proposal, saying it will only hike prices for poor families who consume more sugar. 'Sugar taxes are elitist and inherently regressive,' said Gideon Rozner, Director of Policy at free market think tank the Institute of Public Affairs. 'What kind of mean-spirited organisation proposes to make soft drinks less affordable for working people? 'Not content to throw us out of work and trash our liberties, the public health lobby is now angling to take away the precious few of life's joys we have left. 'The AMA should focus on issues pertaining to the medical profession, not telling the rest of us how to live our lives.'",
  "82cb1aab1871e8c4144517ea010385fa4e2125e3c6db3ec740fed07c": "A seven-month-old girl was shot in the chest and killed during a drive-by shooting in Toledo, Ohio, while she was sitting next to her father in his car.  Desire Hughes was shot on Wednesday night and treated for at least one gunshot wound to the chest before succumbing to her injuries, the Lucas County Coroner's Office reported. Her father, Jeremiah Hughes, 20, was grazed by a bullet in the shooting and has since been released from the hospital, mourning his daughter's death.  Cops believe the shooting to be drugs or gang-related.   'I was a happy dad, you feelin' me? She was gonna change my life, man,' Hughes told the Toledo Blade after coming home on Thursday. 'That was the one that was gonna change my life.  'That's why I'm so sick, I don't even know what to do,' he added. 'My baby... they really took that girl from me.'  No suspects have been identified as the shooting is currently under investigation. Toledo Police Chief George Kral has urged members of the community to check on their outdoor cameras or doorbell monitors for any clues about the shooting.  'I'm imploring the community to reach out and help us out,' Kral told the Blade. 'I mean this is a 7-month-old child, who has never done anything wrong in her little life... we need justice for this young person.'  Toledo Mayor Wade Kapszukiewicz condemned the murder of Desire, the fourth homicide reported this week in the Ohio city, suggesting gang violence was involved in the latest killing.  'No one pulls up to a car and shoots into another car randomly,' Kapszukiewicz told the Blade.  'It's unfair to the 275,000 who live in the city to feel less safe than they should have because of the 50 people in a gang who are playing out a revenge drama that affects all of us.'  Two months ago, Damia Ezell, 10, was also shot in the chest and killed while riding in her uncle's car in Toledo.  Kenneth White, 24, was driving his niece around the Old West End neighborhood when a dark vehicle with tinted windows pulled up beside him and fired at his car. Ezelle was killed and White was taken to the hospital for life-threatening injuries.  Lucas County Children Services Executive Director Robin Reese said there is now a 'troubling trend' of children falling prey to gun violence on the streets of the county.  'This cannot be something normal that we get used to,' she said in a statement.  'Children are literally dying on our streets. This cannot be something that we accept.' Reese led the Lucas County Children Services' annual memorial recognizing children who have died due to abuse or violence in the last year on Thursday, hours after Desire was killed.   ",
  "5cbf6be4eefefa149e59dbeb1f36e4e33ea1d13f27dc0ef35e9dc57e": "Texas Congressman Chip Roy confronted Department of Homeland Security chief Alejandro Mayorkas with photos of dead illegal migrants as he raged at him over Biden's immigration crisis.  Roy, holding up photographs of dead migrants, confronted Mayorkas regarding the administration's policies. 'Mr. Secretary, do you know what this is? This is a mobile morgue, a body trailer needed by counties in south Texas overwhelmed by dead migrants,' Roy said to Mayorkas. 'That particular trailer is filled with these bodies. Twenty-seven bodies that were stored in this mobile morgue in south Texas with dead bodies of migrants.'  'Dead bodies like this one found on a ranch just three weeks ago in south Texas, a dead migrant. Somehow that's compassion,' he added.  Roy believes that the Biden administration, including Mayorkas, have encouraged cartels and other migrants to cross the border, which he says is hurting his state and America.   'You know it and you're ignoring the actual truth!'  'How about the dead bodies found by migrants? Compassion? How about the ranchers, who had to walk out of their door and this is what they faced, gentleman with rocks threatening a rancher in south Texas, only able to be saved when they are able to bring their dogs out to scare the people away in order to save themselves,' he added. He then connected the administration's immigration policies to America's opioid crisis and said the Biden White House's lax enforcement of the border was responsible for thousands of drug deaths.    Mayorkas defended the administration's handling of immigration Wednesday and Thursday amid a huge surge at the Mexico border that is expected to intensify as pandemic-related entry curbs are dropped. President Joe Biden's administration has revealed it plans to end Title 42, a measure allowing the quick expulsion of migrants during the Covid-19 crisis, on May 23 -- in an announcement that sparked cross-party anger.    'How about the lost voices for people dying from fentanyl, the tens of thousands of Americans dying from fentanyl? Faces, faces of Americans, faces of Americans across this country dying because of fentanyl pouring into our country because of your policies that you know full well.' Mayorkas responded: 'Congressman, are you actually interested in the facts and the law?' and tried to continue but Roy would not let him. US Customs and Border Protection says it encountered 7,800 undocumented migrants a day along the southwest border in the past three weeks -- almost five times the average of 1,600 recorded from 2014-2019, before the coronavirus outbreak. 'We inherited a broken and dismantled system that is already under strain. It is not built to manage the current levels and types of migratory flows,' Mayorkas told the House Appropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee, urging Congress to pass long-term reforms. Mayorkas's testimony came with the administration locking horns with a federal court in Louisiana that granted a request by Republican-controlled states to temporarily halt their planning to wind down Title 42. The order prevents the government from taking any action before a hearing on May 13 to determine whether Title 42 can be lifted. Mayorkas set out a blueprint to boost border personnel, target people smugglers, speed up processing and increase holding capacity -- as he warned the worst was yet to come. 'A significant increase in migrant encounters will strain our system even further and we will address this challenge successfully,' he said. 'It will take time, and we need the partnership of Congress, state and local officials, NGOs and communities to do so.' Enacted at the start of the pandemic in March 2020 under then-president Donald Trump, Title 42 requires border agents to turn away anyone who crosses undocumented into the United States. Representative Jim Jordan accused on Thursday the Biden administration of 'deliberately' and 'intentionally' causing the southern border crisis as Republicans tore into Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for being 'out of touch' and a 'traitor.'  The House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member said during his opening statement that Mayorkas will face questions on why he implemented policies that led to the chaos. 'It's intentional, it has to be,' Jordan said at the top of his remarks to the body on Thursday morning. 'The chaos on our southern border is not an accident,' the Ohio Republican congressman continued. 'It's deliberate, it's on purpose, it's by design.' 'President Biden on Day One said there'll be a moratorium on deportations, he ended Remain in Mexico, he terminated agreements with Northern Triangle countries and he stopped building the wall,' Jordan rattled off. 'Those policies, done intentionally, have led to all kinds of bad outcomes.'  He said: 'Americans want legal immigration. President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas want illegal immigration. They want illegal migrants to come, stay and never go home. Now, the secretary won't say that. In fact, he says everything's just fine. He said it yesterday in two congressional hearings. He said it last September. Quote, 'The border is secure,' he told us.'  Mayorkas appeared before the House Appropriations DHS Subcommittee and House Homeland Security Committee on Wednesday to justify the administration's request for $97.3 billion for the department's budget in Fiscal Year 2023. He said the money would go toward investing in meeting the 'the shifting field landscape' at the border and on other national security fronts - like from domestic and foreign terrorism and cyber attacks. During those hearings, Mayorkas was lambasted by Republicans after he said the administration is 'effectively managing' the situation at the southern border. In March alone, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) encountered 221,303 migrants crossing the southern border. This figure is the highest in more than two-decades and the biggest spike since President Joe Biden took office in January 2021. The previous high was in July 2021, when CBP encountered 213,593 migrants. Colorado Republican Representative Ken Buck told Mayorkas during the Judiciary hearing on Wednesday: 'My constituents want you impeached because they believe you've committed treason.' 'They believe you're a traitor. They compare you to Benedict Arnold. You know, no parent with the last name Arnold names their kid Benedict.' Buck said that over the weekend 'a lady approached me and asked me if you [Mayorkas] felt any shame for what you've done to this country.' 'My question for you, Secretary Mayorkas, is very simple,' he added. 'Would you please answer that lady's question? Are you ashamed for what you've done to this country? 'My response to what you have just said - it is so profoundly offensive on so many different levels, in so many different regards. I won't ask you for an apology,' he said. 'Don't. I won't,' Buck shot back. 'I am incredibly proud of my service to this country,' Mayorkas said during the back-and-forth with Buck. 'It is more than 20 years of service in the civilian corps as a federal prosecutor and as a member of the Department of Homeland Security. That is my response.' 'What do you say to the mothers of the children who have died from the fentanyl overdoses? What do you say to all the people out there who can't get an education because of what you've done with immigration in this country? You've secured the homeland? It's a farce,' Buck concluded.",
  "509cacc2a78fac245be7a8656c8c681582c3428b7d369494de8f5730": "Anthony Albanese has been interrogated over his opinion of trans men in an interview with two teenage journalists - who demanded to know: 'Are trans men, men, yes or no?'  The Opposition Leader submitted to an interview with Year 9 student Leonardo Puglisi and his political reporter Roman Mackinnon following on from Prime Minister Scott Morrison's interview with the teens in early April. Mr Puglisi, 14, is the founder of 6News, 'a team of young, passionate reporters' for the digital age with a presence on Youtube, Patreon and other social media channels.  In a teaser clip released for the interview, to be released next Tuesday, Mr Puglisi is seen asking Mr Albanese a 'yes or no question'. 'Are trans men, men, yes or no?'  'Well, it's... it's up to them to define... people are able to define themselves,' Mr Albanese responds.  The teaser clip also sees Mr Albanese asked whether he broke his promise to take all questions from reporters at daily press conference after he curtailed the length of the events following his statistics gaffe on the first day of the campaign. Mr Albanese is also heard outlining Labor's plans for Medicare, childcare and climate change. Mr Puglisi then asks whether he'll 'own up' to mistakes if elected as the clip dissolves to a promo for the broadcast of the full interview on the 6News Youtube channel next week. In early April the teen journalists scored an interview with Scott Morrison in which he responded to the suggestion he is a serial liar as 'silly word games' and 'juvenile debates' that don't matter to ordinary Australians.  'So you don't think Australians are interested in whether their leader tells the truth or not?' Mr Puglisi persisted.  'I do tell the truth,' Mr Morrison responded, but then conceded politicians 'might get the odd fact wrong' and that Australians know he is 'up front' with them.   Puglisi reminded Mr Morrison of two alleged lies he had told regarding his use of the term 'Shanghai Sam' about disgraced former senator Sam Dastyari, and his comments about his Hillsong Church attendance in the wake of allegations about its ex-pastor Brian Houston. 'I didn't say I've never walked into the door of Hillsong church. It hasn't been my home community church. On occasion I've visited there, I've visited many churches in the last 15 years... Coptic orthodox, Greek orthodox, Maronite churches, I've been inside synagogues, I've been inside temples, I've been in mosques, I've been in many places,' Mr Morrison responded. He said the opposition 'throw a lot of mud at you when you're a Prime Minister, and that's because they haven't got any policies ... if you've got nothing to say, and you've got nothing to offer, you'll sledge and you'll throw mud.'  Mr Albanese appears to have conducted the interview with 6News during his enforced isolation period after he contracted Covid. He rejoined the campaign trail on Friday and is due to officially launch Labor's quest for government in Perth on Sunday.  ",
  "62621a4e883d7cbce6106e1e94e63410a4622a63b1aac9bdc655fd70": "Sarah Ferguson has been announced as the new host of the ABC's flagship current affairs programme 7.30 - three decades after she was hired to work for the public broadcaster by her own future husband.  Ferguson, 56, was officially announced on Friday as the replacement for Leigh Sales after the host revealed in February she would step down from her role in June, after 12 years in the plum position.  It marks a stunning rise for the veteran investigative journalist who first began work with the public broadcaster as a humble researcher when Nigerian-born Ferguson was selected to work with a young Australian journalist on a job. Tony Jones, best known as the former host of Q&A, was working as a London correspondent for the ABC when he hired Ferguson to help him out on a story about French politics in 1992.  The chance encounter was not only the beginning of a stellar career but the start of a romantic relationship that led to marriage and three children.  'It was a 'there you are - I've been waiting for you' moment,' Sarah Ferguson told Mia Freedman on a recent episode of her No Filter podcast.  Ferguson and Jones tied the knot in 1993 - one year after they first met in Paris.  The pair have been inseparable ever since and have travelled around the world together as they support each other in their roles. The couple spent a year in Rovinj, in Croatia, in 1996 and relocated to the United States when Ferguson landed a role as 'special reporter' in Washington in 2021.  After stints elsewhere, Ferguson once again joined the ABC in 2008 and has produced award winning documentaries, such as the multi-part 'Killing Season' about the end of the Rudd/Gillard government, for Four Corners.   Over her career - which has included high-profile roles in Washington and documentaries about domestic violence, paedophilia and live cattle exports - Ferguson has garnered a reputation for no-nonsense interviewing. That is what she's expected to bring to the role as she steps into Sales' shoes. It's a role she's reprised before, filling in as 7.30 host for six months in 2014 while Sales was on maternity leave. 'I'm delighted to take on the presenter role at 7.30,' Ferguson said. 'Led by Leigh Sales and chief political correspondent Laura Tingle, the 7.30 team has created a powerhouse program, making superb current affairs journalism on the cutting edge of the genre.' 'Working in collaboration with the inimitable Laura is irresistible. Adding myself into that mix sounds tremendously rewarding at a time when scrutiny of power is essential, when our social structures are undergoing profound change. 'On Leigh's departure, I'd like to say that her diligence and skill have made an enormous contribution to Australian journalism. What you don't see in her calm studio presence is the huge amount of work she does in preparation. It will be a pleasure to take over from such a pro. 'Public service journalism has to deliver for the Australian audience, all day, every day. No one in Australia should ever feel they have no voice.  'It's our job to show how public broadcasting can create a place for everyone to come and debate, think deeply, be thrilled, entertained and sometimes provoked,' Ferguson said.  'This is the opposite of seeking to polarise in ways we are seeing in media worldwide.' ABC managing director David Anderson said audiences 'know and respect' Ferguson. 'Her work has set an unparalleled standard not only in Australian journalism but internationally, as evidenced by her recent reporting from Ukraine,' he said. 'Sarah is an exceptional appointment to take over 7.30 hosting duties from Leigh, alongside an outstanding team. 7.30 has been Australia's premier daily current affairs program for decades and will continue to be so with Sarah at the helm.'  Sarah Ferguson was born in Lagos, Nigeria, where her British-born parents lived before moving to Britain as the Biafran war broke out. Ferguson's career began in newspapers in the United Kingdom, before moving to Paris and working as a researcher and production assistant on arts programs for French and British broadcasters. She met her husband Tony Jones, after he hired her to help him for a story on ABC in 1992, while he was working as ABC's London correspondent . Ferguson had been working as a researcher and production assistant for French and British broadcasters up until that point in time.  In 2000, Ferguson worked as a reporter for Dateline and Insight. In 2004 she joined the Sunday program on Channel Nine and in 2008 joined Four Corners. In 2014, Ferguson hosted 7.30 and her interviews with the Australian treasurer Joe Hockey were nominated for a Walkley for journalistic excellence.  They would later be described as 'aggressive' and 'the tone of the questioning could have been interpreted by some viewers to be a potential breach of the ABC's impartiality guidelines.' In 2014, Ferguson caused controversy at the Walkley Awards when she publicly railed against job cuts at the ABC.  In 2016, she presented award winning documentary 'Hitting Home'. The segment covered domestic violence in Australia and earned Ferguson a Walkley Documentary Award and Best Documentary at the 2016 AACTA Awards.   In 2017, as Ferguson was getting off a plane, she was told that her mother Marjorie had died suddenly in England.  Later she became aware that hospital negligence had led to her mother's death. She wrote about the experience in her book On Mother. Director of News Justin Stevens described her as 'formidable'. 'We're incredibly fortunate with the depth of talent we have at the ABC,' he said. 'Leigh Sales has done a superb job anchoring 7.30 for the past 12 years and to have someone of the calibre of Sarah Ferguson to take up the baton, working alongside Laura Tingle and the rest of the talented 7.30 team, is terrific news for audiences.'  Ferguson took up a temporary post in the U.S. capital early last year after being unable to begin her planned role as the ABC's Beijing bureau chief due to poor relations between Australia and China. When she previously hosted 7.30 report in 2014, while Sales was on maternity leave, Ferguson came under fire following a hostile interview with Treasurer Joe Hockey that breached the broadcaster's bias guidelines, an ABC-commissioned editorial review found at the time. Presenting ABC's 7:30, formerly The 7:30 Report, is considered one of the most demanding and high-profile roles in Australian television.  ABC viewers were shocked when Leigh Sales revealed in February she was stepping down as host. In the months leading up to her resignation, the single mother of two was reportedly struggling to balance her demanding job with homeschooling her children. Sales says her decision to quit came down to her 'two beautiful little boys' wanting to see more of their mum.  She told viewers she wanted them to hear the news from her 'personally', as she explained she wanted to finally spend evenings with her kids after more than a decade.  'I was appointed to the job on December 3, 2010. This is my 12th year in the seat. That was five Prime Ministers ago. It was so long ago that Donald Trump was just a guy with a bad orange hairdo hosting The Apprentice,' she said. 'There's nothing wrong other than I just feel a strong sense of it being time to pass the baton to the next runner in the race and to take a break. At the end of an election cycle feels like a good time to move on to something new at the ABC.' She said she hoped it was obvious she had always approached the job with one goal 'to ask frank questions of people in power, without fear or favour, that a fair-minded, reasonable person with some common sense watching at home might like to ask'. In a possible first for an Australian TV news presenter, she then used strong language, saying she had 'tried to shut down and call out bulls**t, hold powerful people to account, expose lies, incompetence and exaggeration in all political parties and all issues and present facts even when they're unpopular or inconvenient'.   Sales said anchoring 7.30 has been 'the most amazing job and I'll never stop being grateful for the opportunities it's given me'. She then mentioned one of her most memorable interviewees over the years. 'The celebrities come and go but you never forget people like Matthew Low,' Ms Sales said. 'His wife was killed in the Dreamworld roller-coaster accident and found the strength down the track to do an interview and try to ensure no other family would have to go through what his family did. 'People like Matthew are the ones who stick with you. 'Every time you interview somebody whose life has been devastated you feel terrified by what life has dished up to them and incredibly humbled by how they met it with strength and clarity and dignity and you just don't forget it.' She did single out one celebrity, though, saying meeting Paul McCartney 'and getting a hug from him is one of the best days of my life'. Ms Sales also mentioned the viewers and how people would approach her in public and say how much joy her interview with McCartney had given them. She spoke about what a demanding hosting 7.30 is and that it comes with a lot of pressure and scrutiny. 'When I first started I didn't have children. And now I have two boys aged 10 and eight. And they've only ever known their mum at work four nights a week. 'They want me home with them before 8.30pm and I don't think that's too much for two little boys to ask and they're two beautiful little boys.' Ms Sales also thanked viewers for their supportive messages about the ABC itself. 'The ABC is so often under fire and it means a lot to all of us to know the public supports us,' she said. She said that 7.30 'is an incredibly important program' and that it will keep going from strength to strength. 'I'm looking forward to having a good break and figuring out what I do next at the ABC ... I'm be around for a while yet.' She finished by saying 'Please keep watching, my friends. See you on Monday. Goodnight.'",
  "af2eea145d612ddfb3d13e406b0bd875bccd7c973c3fcf4a1ff499e7": "Alan Jones has spoken. Scott Morrison has 'no hope' of holding on to power in the May 21 federal election. Three years ago, Jones was the only political commentator in Australia to correctly tip the new Liberal Prime Minister defeating Labor's Bill Shorten.  This time around he says Morrison has no chance to do the same to Anthony Albanese. 'Morrison is the handbrake,' he told Daily Mail Australia of the government's re-election chances. 'The electorate hate him. His own cabinet don't like him. The party know it but it was too late to make a change. 'To keep government, he has to hold every seat he's got and win two more.  'He's no hope. 'He's going to lose seats in Western Australia, South Australia, New South Wales.  'He's upset north Queensland over the Bowen River dam. 'It's the old story. Opposition don't win elections, governments lose them. That's what is happening.' Jones, one of the country's highest-profile conservative broadcasters who ruled Sydney breakfast radio for three decades on 2UE and 2GB, said Albanese's poor start to the campaign won't count at the polling booth. 'Anthony Albanese has been to every pub in Australia,' he said.  'While the government was completely tied up in trying to stop people from getting the flu Albanese was getting out there meeting people. 'They all know him now.' Which is not to say that Jones believes Albanese is the best person for the top job, after he struggled to answer questions about the Reserve Bank cash rate and unemployment. 'There are good people on both sides of politics, but unfortunately they're not in leadership,' he said. Jones, 81, who retired from his top-rating radio career in May 2020 and parted company with Sky News in November last year, has been unusually quiet in recent months after four operations on his back over Christmas, That is about to change. He is planning to bounce back with a vengeance after forming his own digital TV and news network, Australian Digital Holdings. Operating out of a renovated warehouse in Sydney's Chippendale and available free on the ADH.TV app, Jones's first program launches on Monday with guests Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and One Nation leader Pauline Hanson. He says he is looking forward to the freedom of speaking his mind without management interference after years of working for major media organisations. 'At Sky I would get legal letters every afternoon telling me that I couldn't say this or that,' he said. 'We would have to show them the script. The show would be ready to go at 4.30pm and a letter would arrive saying 'you can't say that'. In the end I thought, I don't need this'. After clashes over his coverage of Covid-19, Jones was dumped from his four-nights-a-week program and offered a weekly spot on Sky's streaming service, but he declined the offer. He has been replaced by British media personality Piers Morgan in a worldwide mega-deal, but early figures supplied by Sky suggest the move has not been an immediate success. Jones's first show on Sky drew 109,000 viewers. The first airing of Piers Morgan Uncensored attracted 86,000 viewers, less than the 95,000 that Jones had for his final program. Jones says he wishes Morgan all the best with his show, but has a word of warning about management interefence. 'Piers Morgan Uncensored,' he scoffed. 'I've got news for you, mate.' Jones was previously a speechwriter for former Liberal prime minister Malcolm Fraser and ran as a Liberal state by-election candidate in 1978. He was also a close confidante of former Liberal PM John Howard, who lost the November 2007 election after the Reserve Bank of Australia raised interest rates during an election campaign. The same fate could await Morrison, with three of the Big Four banks - ANZ, Westpac and NAB - predicting a rate rise on May 3 - less than three weeks before voters go to the polls as inflation surges at the fastest pace in 21 years. Howard had won four elections and was in power for 11 years while Morrison, if Jones is proven right, will fail to win a fourth consecutive term for the Coalition after nine years in office, including almost four as PM. Newspoll also shows Labor leading the Coalition 53 per cent to 47 per cent, after preferences. A uniform 4.6 per cent swing to Labor would see the Opposition pick up at least a dozen seats to form a majority government, enough to make Albanese Australia's 31st prime minister. He would also be only the fourth Labor leader to win from Opposition since World War II.   This time, the opinion polls may be proven right. ",
  "9af80b49f99b5c0dbe3b62d4446c351e9ddd23bdc04f13044627363a": "Two Labor frontbenchers have been struck down with Covid-19 three weeks out from the federal election on the same day their leader emerges from a week in isolation. Anthony Albanese made his first public appearance sin a week on Friday after he spent seven days in quarantine at his Sydney home battling the virus. But just as he came out of isolation, his deputy leader Richard Marles tested positive, as did fellow frontbencher Madeleine King.  It means Mr Marles will miss the official launch of Labor's election campaign in Perth this Sunday.  'I was looking forward to travelling west to attend Labor's launch,' Mr Marles tweeted on Friday. 'This morning after taking a routine test for Covid, I returned a positive result. I will be isolating at home + following advice. I'll be back on the trail in no time, fighting for a better future with Anthony Albanese.' Mr Albanese also revealed trade and resources opposition spokeswoman Madeleine King will also miss Labor's campaign launch in her home state. 'More than half my Shadow Cabinet have had Covid now. And at the moment, I think there is at least two of them out,' he told the Today show on Friday. Mr Albanese's first day back on the campaign trail was marred by a Twitter blunder and a live television smackdown by Today Show host Ally Langdon.  The Labor leader shared a picture of his beloved cavoodle, Toto, watching on as he did a series of live crosses to the ABC and the Nine Network's Today Show on Friday morning.  However, the picture was swiftly deleted from social media as it clearly showed the wannabe prime minister's phone number on the dog's collar. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Labor for comment over the deleted tweet. It comes as the Labor leader emerged from isolation after spending the last week isolating at home with the virus - but if he thought he was in for an easy ride with the TV hosts, he was sorely mistaken.  Mr Albanese was grilled on Friday morning about the rising cost of living as inflation hits a 21-year high at 5.1 per cent.  The Opposition Leader said he had been doing some online shopping in quarantine and noted the cost of an iceberg lettuce is now $5.50. He was abruptly interrupted by Today co-host Allison Langdon. 'I don't think people want to hear politicians telling us what the problem is anymore,' she said.  'People are living this every day.' 'They know what the problem is. They want to know how you are going to fix it!' Briefly taken off guard, Mr Albanese insists Labor will fix the issue by plan to address wages while taking a swipe at the Coalition government. 'This government won't even put in submissions supporting a wage increase for aged care workers,' he said. 'We will lift productivity through the national reconstruction fund, by having the NBN operate properly to lift the productivity of businesses, and then the way you can place better profits and better wages.' 'The only way you can do that without placing pressure on inflation is by making sure you have those productivity improvements, and we are aiming at that as well.' Mr Albanese doubled down on his attack of the Coalition over living costs on ABC's News Breakfast.  'We need an economic plan so the economy works for people, not the other way around,' he said. 'This government are happy to claim credit any time something goes right but as soon as things don't, they look to blame someone else and not accept responsibility.  'We will accept responsibility. We will step up and recognise that people are doing it tough.' Earlier, the Labor leader took to Twitter to express his delight to be out of quarantine. 'Out of iso and back at it,' he captioned a photo with Toto before sharing a clip of the cavoodle racing around an oval after a week of being cooped up at home. 'I'm not the only one excited to be out,' he added. It comes amid murmurs that Mr Albanese was somewhat upstaged by his own frontbenchers while off sick.  Campaign spokesman Jason Clare impressed Labor voters and commentators with his strong performance in front of the cameras while Mr Albanese was in isolation.   Mr Albanese will fly to Perth later on Friday ahead of the official launch of Labor's campaign on Sunday.  He told the Today show  he feels 'terrific' after the virus knocked him around. However, he said he isn't in a rush to make up for lost time just three weeks out from the May 21 election. 'It just means being sensible. So, it means if I feel really tired, have a rest,' he said. 'It means doing, perhaps, less things during the day.  'But I expect and the doctors' advice is I'll get better each day and certainly today I feel terrific this morning, and I feel better than I did yesterday and yesterday I felt better than I did the day before. That's what happens.' By Charlie Moore, Political Reporter for Daily Mail Australia Jason Clare has received lavish praise yet again after another impressive media performance - but the odds of him one day becoming Prime Minister are stacked against him. The frontbench Labor MP made headlines last week for his impeccable communication skills in daily press conferences, with many supporters wishing he was leader instead of Anthony Albanese. The cries for him to take over stepped up again on Thursday after he expertly handled a lively media pack and prompted laughter with a witty joke at the expense of Liberal minister Alan Tudge. 'I don't think Scooby-doo could find Alan Tudge at the moment,' he said as Mr Tudge remains away from the limelight after being cleared of abusing his former staffer.  Twitter went into meltdown once again, with supporters and journalists heaping praise on the 50-year-old father of two from western Sydney. 'Loving Jason Clare's media conferences so much,' one user wrote.  'Jason Clare is on fire,' said another who praised his 'wit and humour'.  Mr Clare has also been described as handsome, and even Mr Albanese admitted: 'Jason Clare is certainly better looking than I am. There is no question about that.' But despite his strong performances, the odds of Mr Clare becoming the next Labor leader are long. Tanya Plibersek is favourite at $2.10 followed by Jim Chalmers at $3.75, Kristina Keneally at $6.50 and then Mr Clare at $8, according to Sportsbet. If he wanted to become leader in the event that Labor loses and Mr Albanese resigns, Mr Clare would likely face a messy factional struggle. As a member of the right faction of the NSW division he may have to see off challenges from Shadow Energy Minister Chris Bowen or Shadow Attorney-General Tony Burke who are in the same faction. And then he would be up against Tanya Plibersek who is a leading figure in the NSW Left faction - even before challengers from other states like Mr Chalmers and Richard Marles are considered. Ever since he came to Parliament in 2007, Mr Clare has played down his desire to become leader and those close to him say he is focussed on being a good MP and father. Mr Clare told Sky News in 2014: 'I might be touted but I have no desire to do that job at all' and revealed his 'dream job' would be minister for education.  'For me I feel like I am part of the team and not the leader of the team,' he said. However, Labor sources speaking on the condition of anonymity told Daily Mail Australia that him playing down his ambitions could simply be a smart strategy to win over voters. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern played down her ambitions before she became Labour Party leader seven weeks before the 2017 election. Other Labor sources said Mr Clare's excellent performances have put him front and centre of his colleagues' minds as a future leadership candidate. But right now Mr Clare is focussed on helping Mr Albanese kick out Scott Morrison. Asked last week why he was not in charge, he replied: 'The short answer is Anthony Albanese is the leader this country desperately needs.'  ",
  "4bbc61124247579606046048b6eb760d6e3c4600fda0bf29b67f8c11": "Grace Tame was brought to tears when interviewing Anthony Albanese for a women's magazine - but the pair steered clear of discussing bullying allegations from Labor's 'mean girls'. The advocate for sexual abuse survivors had a friendly chat with the Opposition leader for InStyle Australia discussing everything from Mr Albanese's upbringing, Scott Morrison, gender diversity, the Covid pandemic and Ms Tame's bong photo. But on Friday 2GB broadcaster Jim Wilson questioned why the former Australian of the Year didn't bring up the topic of alleged bullying within Labor's ranks once.  'I wouldn't believe in an in-depth interview you wouldn't ask one question of Anthony Albanese why he didn't launch some sort of an investigation into serious allegations of bullying within their own ranks,' Wilson said on The Today Show on Friday morning. 'The mean girls group.'  Labor has resisted intense pressure to launch an independent inquiry into the alleged bullying of Senator Kimberley Kitching before her fatal heart attack at the age of 52 last month. Senator Kitching's friends claim she was being bullied by senior Labor senators Kristina Keneally, Penny Wong and Katy Gallagher, which they deny. Senator Kitching had dubbed the trio 'mean girls' in reports on the bullying claims, close friends said.  Wilson said: 'I think that's an obvious question I think a lot of Australians want an answer for. We haven't got that.' Guest and former Deputy Prime Minister Wayne Swan interrupted to say: 'It wasn't an obvious question because we have'. Wilson shut Mr Swan down, saying there 'hasn't been a proper investigation, there hasn't been an independent investigation, come on Wayne'.  'If you're committed to a safe workplace, Wayne and a better culture, no doubt if this was happening in the Coalition ranks you would have been all over it,' the radio broadcaster continued.  'It is a cop out that there hasn't been a proper independent investigation into very, very serious allegations. I can't believe that in that interview there wasn't one question.' Mr Swan hit back saying: 'With respect that is just crap.' Wilson had earlier discussed the topic on his Drive show, labelling the exclusion of any mention of bully allegations 'pathetic'. 'The mean girls story rocked Australia,' he said. 'There should have been a proper independent investigation.  'So Mr Albanese, the apparent great protector of women's rights going toe to toe with Grace Tame, and none of them thought it necessary to address the widely reported alleged bullying of women that took place within Labor's ranks. 'To me that is pathetic.' During their interview, the Labor leader recounted to Ms Tame how his single mother, Maryanne, struggled to bring him up in her Camperdown council house in Sydney's Inner West in the 1960s - bringing Ms Tame to tears. Midway through the video link interview, Mr Albanese suddenly broke off his story when he noticed the tears streaming down Ms Tame's face. 'Sorry, I didn't mean to upset you there...' he said. Ms Tame replied: 'No, it's just, yeah, I respect that so much...' She then looked off camera and revealed her fiance Max Heerey was also sobbing over Mr Albanese's story. 'Max is crying! Oh, I want to give you a hug,' she said through her tears. The Labor leader had been speaking about how his mother had been abandoned by her lover who she became pregnant with, then married another girl from his hometown in Italy. But his mother insisted on keeping her son, taking her lover's surname and then pretending he had died in a car crash as she brought Mr Albanese up alone. Ms Albanese scraped a meagre living as a cleaner to keep them both and put her son through university before later being crippled by arthritis and dying at the age of just 65 in 2002. 'It's one of the things that has focused me and a part of who I am,' Mr Albanese told Ms Tame. 'She always respected everyone and I grew up with the confidence of having a mum who lived a lot of her aspirations through me. 'And so she's the most important role model in my life and she's very much still part of who I am today.' The final comment proved too much for Ms Tame who broke down in tears. She later added: 'Oh, I'm still just, I'm still just processing your story. I'll probably go and cry about it later and I'm not ashamed of that!' Mr Albanese said he had 'done okay' and she replied: 'No, you've done better than okay. A lot of respect for you, Anthony.' He added: 'Where I grew up there was a much better chance of going to jail than going to Parliament.'  Ms Tame said she could relate it to her own mother who grew up in Tasmania as the youngest of five girls.  'My nan raised them all by herself for the most part, on a secretary's wage,' Ms Tame told Mr Albanese.  'And they had to do everything themselves.' Ms Tame made headlines earlier this year when she grimaced and side-eyed Prime Minister Scott Morrison at an Australian of the Year function in January.  And she took the chance to have another crack at the PM in the chummy chat with Mr Albanese. 'I've tried to go through this whole interview being very conscious of the fact that I'm talking to you and to avoid criticising old mate Scott,' she said.  'But if I was to make one observation... You've touched on the lack of authenticity, that's one of them. But another is that he just seems to be completely averse to owning any mistakes, and that's a weakness.' Mr Albanese replied: 'It's always someone else.' ",
  "668cac3e749981280447d927daad63d7939997de2f0eacc8a0b21ded": "A new Pfizer pill designed to treat high-risk Covid sufferers is set to hit Australia and will be available in chemists in just days.  The Paxlovid tablets will be given to people with risk factors such as diabetes, obesity, heart, lung, liver diseases, and those more at risk of hospitalisation.  The pharmaceutical company's senior medical director, Dr Krishan Thiru, told the Today Show on Friday the drug is not a vaccine to prevent COVID. 'It is not a vaccine to prevent COVID. It is a treatment for people who have recently been diagnosed,' Dr Thiru said.  The drug is set to fill a gap in the market treating the dreaded disease.  Up until this point, most Aussies with Covid have had to make do with paracetamol and other pain killers normally taken when someone has a cold.  The doctor said the new drug works by stymying an enzyme that helps the virus to replicate.  'It means the virus can't multiply inside your body and so your body's own immune defences are able to combat the virus and reduce the chance in certain patients,' Dr Thiru said.  '[It helps] people who are at high risk of complications, and reduces the chance of those complications,' he said.  These include people over 65 with Covid risk factors, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged over 50 or others who are immuno-compromised.   'It is designed for people who otherwise might be at risk of requiring hospitalisation or not surviving.' Dr Thiru said a similar drug available for general use could be on the horizon but the priority lay with helping the most vulnerable.  'We are continuing to investigate treatments and antivirals in other populations as well, but at the moment we have several thousand people in hospital,' he said.  'And dozens are dying every day and they are the high risk patients, and that's what Paxlovid is for.'  The drug does not replace the vaccine but pairs alongside of it for those who need it the most.  'Vaccination is the most important thing people can do to protect their own health, Dr Thiru said.  'Paxlovid is an important second line of defence, for vulnerable Australians, particularly at high risk.'",

  "2d6434a0a939f2c0f11346947bd5e5a095302b788a5b1e2818092c31": "NYC Mayor Eric Adams partied with Naomi Campbell and singer Jon Batiste at his favorite private members' club as crime continues to soar in the Big Apple.   Adams was spotted dining Wednesday night at Zero Bond, a private members club he regularly frequents, with supermodel Naomi Campbell, Grammy-winning musician Jon Batiste and Hollywood agent Cade Hudson.  LionTree CEO Aryeh B. Bourkoff and Abiola Oke, CEO of Adisa Consultants, were also in attendance. Campbell, posting about the gathering on her Instagram account, said: '#Embracing the Big [Apple] what a welcome!!! and meeting of the minds..@nycmayor @aryehbourkoff @jonbatiste.' The group allegedly discussed 'everything from philanthropy to fashion and music' while they dined at the exclusive NoHo hotspot, insiders told Page Six.  The model, who shared several pictures from the evening, added: 'Thank you Cade Hudson bringing us all together Love & Adore you.'  The mayor seems to be partying hard as New York battles a 42 percent uptick in crime. He was also pictured alongside Mary J. Blige at the grand opening of Brooklyn Chophouse in Times Square on Monday. Adams, a former cop, has vowed to get crime under control and decrease bloodshed throughout the city, one of the key points of his mayoral campaign. Adams ended his fourth month in office with crime and gun violence still on the rise. During a press conference Tuesday, Adams vowed to crack down on transit crimes, which is up more than 60 percent, but also lazy officers patrolling subway stations.  He made the plea when asked by a journalist about reports of multiple uniformed cops being spotted scrolling through phones while on duty guarding the city's crime-ridden transport network. The former NYPD captain warned: 'We are going to start taking very aggressive actions to make sure police are patrolling our subway system and not patrolling their iPhone.' 'If you see it, send me a picture. I'll go to that district the next day and see exactly what is happening. 'Send me a shot. New Yorkers, you see that send me a photo and I will be at that station.' Adams spokesman told anyone with photos to send them to his press office, whose email address is pressoffice@cityhall.nyc.gov. Adams said that New Yorkers can look forward to a 'visible difference in policing in the next couple of weeks.'  He also took aim at the rising crime rates in the city during Tuesday's news briefing. 'New Yorkers have a right to be angry, a right to expect more -- to feel safe, to be safe, to know that your city is looking out for you, your family, and those in need,' Adams said in his speech after his first 100 days in office have been plagued by skyrocketing crime. Felony assaults are up 21 percent than at the same time in 2021, robbery is up nearly 47 percent, rape is up nearly 15 percent, and the percentage of shooting victims is up eight percent, according to the latest statistics from the city's police department. Murders are down just 13 percent. The mayor pointed out that hate crimes continue to be directed at Asian, Muslim, Jewish, Sikh, and LGBTQ+ New Yorkers. 'Our sister Michelle Go was pushed to her death in front of a train in an act of horrifying hatred,' he said, adding that dozens more of 'our New York City neighbors' have been killed by gun violence. Adams named several of the victims, including an aspiring rapper who was executed in cold blood, a 19-year-old girl was killed as she worked the night shift in East Harlem and two police officers who were shot dead responding to a call. 'Their names will echo in our hearts forever: Kristal, Jayquan, Kade, Sally, Angellyah. Detectives Wilbert Mora and Jason Rivera,' he said, pointing out that many of the victims' families were at the speech on Tuesday. 'I can only imagine the loss you feel and the pain you live with,' he told them. 'But I will not rest until we have addressed the conditions that led to that loss. We will do what is necessary to make all of our communities safe. You have my word, as a former police officer, a fellow New Yorker, and your mayor.' Additionally, Adams will be meeting with NYPD commanding officers on Saturday to brainstorm ideas about combatting crime in the city. 'I have a major meeting this weekend with all of my commanders,' the mayor confirmed to The New York Post on Wednesday. 'We're going to sit down for several hours to get our summer plan in order, as well as, think how we deploy police.'  Adams has reportedly requested that all the invited officers bring three plans or ideas that could reduce crime in their patrol areas.  He will also review the latest statistics on crime, summonses, homeless encampment clearings and Civilian Complaint Review Board cases, as well as information on each command's integrity control officer. While Adams is seemingly optimistic about the meeting, one source familiar with the meeting told the Post that commanders have hailed it as a 'joke'.",
  "78ae818231d90bf1c4b61cc1c521601ba90fc828bbd02c2df43788f9": "Donald Trump has made his debut on his Twitter rival Truth Social with a self-deprecating gag about one of his many controversial tweets. The former president wrote: 'I'M BACK! #COVFEFE' in his inaugural post Thursday evening. He accompanied the message with a photograph of himself looking at his phone on an immaculate green croquet lawn outside his Mar-a-Lago country club in West Palm Beach, Florida.   #COVEFE is a lighthearted reference to Trump's 2017 tweet, where he criticized the media coverage of his administration. On May 30, 2017, the then-president wrote on Twitter - which he vowed not to rejoin, despite Elon Musk's $44billion purchase - wrote: 'Despite the constant negative press covfefe.'  The mishap received more than 100,000 likes and retweets each before it was deleted and sparked an internet frenzy.  Now, after more than a year, Trump's social media break has ended after he was banned from Twitter, Facebook and Instagram last year in the wake of the January 6 riots.  He insists he won't return to Twitter, even after it was bought by Elon Musk, who has vowed a far less censorious approach to content moderation, sparking rumors Trump could be allowed back.  'I am not going on Twitter, I am going to stay on Truth,' Trump told Fox News. 'I hope Elon buys Twitter because he'll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on Truth,' Trump said. Representatives for Truth Social said the platform is 'better than being on Twitter' and will be a positive impact within the social media world, but does view it as competition with Twitter.  They hope to take the firm public as part of a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) worth $3.5 billion, although many prospective users say they've struggled to sign up.  'I think it is good. We want liberty and justice and fairness in our country, and the more we can have open, the better, but no, I don't view that as a competition for what I am doing,' he told Fox News.  'This is a platform for my voice. TRUTH is a platform for my voice and for my supporters.'  He also criticized Twitter, before Musk's takeover, for censoring Republicans and limiting the political conversations. He said 'no interactions' were happening and it became 'boring because conservatives were thrown off or got off the platform when I left.' 'It became boring because there was no interaction, the interaction on TRUTH has been amazing,' he told Fox News. 'Truth Social will be a voice for me. And that's something nobody else can get.' In a series of tweets on Wednesday, Musk accused the social media giant of censoring free speech, took shots at its lawyer Vijaya Gadde and bashed Donald Trump's rival service Truth Social for its 'terrible name'. 'Truth Social (terrible name) exists because Twitter censored free speech,' Musk wrote in a tweet, adding, 'Should be called Trumpet instead!' He noted the Truth Social app is currently beating Twitter and TikTok in Apple's App Store, sharing rankings of the most-downloaded free apps. The tycoon had earlier issued a scathing tweet in response to reports Gadde, 48, had been crying at news of the deal. He wrote: 'Suspending the Twitter account of a major news organization for publishing a truthful story was obviously incredibly inappropriate.'    Musk was referring to the suspension of the New York Post's account for its exclusive about Hunter Biden's laptop in the run-up to the 2020 election.  Initially dismissed as 'misinformation' by liberal outlets and social media networks, the laptop and its contents have since been verified by many of the same publications.   Meanwhile, Twitter employees are freaking out in internal chatrooms over Musk's $44billion deal to acquire the firm, messages seen by the New York Post show.  'We're all going through the five stages of grief in cycles and everyone's nerves are frazzled,' one senior staff software engineer reportedly wrote on the company's internal Slack channel. The staffer called Musk an 'a**hole,' and tried to console his colleagues. 'We're all spinning our wheels, and coming up with worst-case scenarios (Trump returns! No more moderation!). 'The fact is that [Musk] has not talked about what he's planning on doing in any detail outside of broad sweeping statements that could be easily seen as hyperbolic showboating,' he added. One site reliability engineer wrote that it was 'physically cringy watching Elon talk about free speech.' A senior staff video engineer announced his plans to quit, saying: 'Not the place to say it perhaps, but I will not work for this company after the takeover.' Musk perhaps did little to allay Twitter staffers fears as he posted several tweets critical of Gadde, Twitter's chief legal officer. She was one of the key executives in the decisions to ban Trump from the platform and censor reporting on Hunter Biden's laptop. ",
  "e1a2e97b27099de72212d6246744a31131681432a4220d036ae1bebd": "Sarah Ferguson will become the new host of the ABC's flagship current affairs programme 7.30 - three decades after she was hired by the public broadcaster as a humble researcher to help her future husband on a project. Ferguson was officially announced on Friday as the replacement to Leigh Sales after the host revealed in February she would step down from her role in June. It marks a meteoric rise for the veteran investigative journalist who first worked with the public broadcaster in a 'sliding doors' moment some 30 years ago.   Former Q&A host Tony Jones had been working as a London correspondent at the time and hired Ferguson to help him on a story about French politics in 1992.  The chance encounter was not only the beginning of a stellar career at the public broadcaster but the start of a romantic relationship that led to marriage and three beautiful children.  Ferguson and Jones tied the knot in 1993 - a year after they first met in Paris.  'It was a 'there you are - I've been waiting for you' moment,' Sarah Ferguson told Mia Freedman on the latest episode of her No Filter podcast.  The pair have been inseparable ever since and have travelled around the world together as they support each other in their roles. The couple spent a year in Rovinj, in Croatia, in 1996 and relocated to the United States when Ferguson landed a role as 'special reporter' in Washington in 2021.  Ferguson officially joined the ABC in 2008 and has produced award winning documentaries, such as 'The Killing Season', for Four Corners.   Over her career - which has included high-profile roles in Washington and documentaries about domestic violence, paedophilia and live cattle exports - Ferguson has garnered a reputation for no-nonsense interviewing. That is what she's expected to bring to the role as she steps into Sales' shoes. It's a role she's reprised before, filling in as 7.30 host for six months in 2014 while Sales was on maternity leave. 'I'm delighted to take on the presenter role at 7.30,' says Ferguson. 'Led by Leigh Sales and chief political correspondent Laura Tingle, the 7.30 team has created a powerhouse program, making superb current affairs journalism on the cutting edge of the genre.' 'Working in collaboration with the inimitable Laura is irresistible. Adding myself into that mix sounds tremendously rewarding at a time when scrutiny of power is essential, when our social structures are undergoing profound change. 'On Leigh's departure, I'd like to say that her diligence and skill have made an enormous contribution to Australian journalism. What you don't see in her calm studio presence is the huge amount of work she does in preparation. It will be a pleasure to take over from such a pro. 'Public service journalism has to deliver for the Australian audience, all day, every day. No one in Australia should ever feel they have no voice.  'It's our job to show how public broadcasting can create a place for everyone to come and debate, think deeply, be thrilled, entertained and sometimes provoked,' Ferguson said.  'This is the opposite of seeking to polarise in ways we are seeing in media worldwide.' ABC managing director David Anderson said audiences 'know and respect' Ferguson. 'Her work has set an unparalleled standard not only in Australian journalism but internationally, as evidenced by her recent reporting from Ukraine,' he said. 'Sarah is an exceptional appointment to take over 7.30 hosting duties from Leigh, alongside an outstanding team. 7.30 has been Australia's premier daily current affairs program for decades and will continue to be so with Sarah at the helm.'  Sarah Ferguson was born in Lagos, Nigeria, where her British-born parents lived before moving to Britain as the Biafran war broke out. Ferguson's career began in newspapers in the United Kingdom, before moving to Paris and working as a researcher and production assistant on arts programs for French and British broadcasters. She met her husband Tony Jones, after he hired her to help him for a story on ABC in 1992, while he was working as ABC's London correspondent . Ferguson had been working as a researcher and production assistant for French and British broadcasters up until that point in time.  In 2000, Ferguson worked as a reporter for Dateline and Insight. In 2004 she joined the Sunday program on Channel Nine and in 2008 joined Four Corners. In 2014, Ferguson hosted 7.30 and her interviews with the Australian treasurer Joe Hockey were nominated for a Walkley for journalistic excellence.  They would later be described as 'aggressive' and 'the tone of the questioning could have been interpreted by some viewers to be a potential breach of the ABC's impartiality guidelines.' In 2014, Ferguson caused controversy at the Walkley Awards when she publicly railed against job cuts at the ABC.  In 2016, she presented award winning documentary 'Hitting Home'. The segment covered domestic violence in Australia and earned Ferguson a Walkley Documentary Award and Best Documentary at the 2016 AACTA Awards.   In 2017, as Ferguson was getting off a plane, she was told that her mother Marjorie had died suddenly in England.  Later she became aware that hospital negligence had led to her mother's death. She wrote about the experience in her book On Mother. Director of News Justin Stevens described her as 'formidable'. 'We're incredibly fortunate with the depth of talent we have at the ABC,' he said. 'Leigh Sales has done a superb job anchoring 7.30 for the past 12 years and to have someone of the calibre of Sarah Ferguson to take up the baton, working alongside Laura Tingle and the rest of the talented 7.30 team, is terrific news for audiences.'  Ferguson took up a temporary post in the U.S. capital early last year after being unable to begin her planned role as the ABC's Beijing bureau chief due to poor relations between Australia and China. When she previously hosted 7.30 report in 2014, while Sales was on maternity leave, Ferguson came under fire following a hostile interview with Treasurer Joe Hockey that breached the broadcaster's bias guidelines, an ABC-commissioned editorial review found at the time. Presenting ABC's 7:30, formerly The 7:30 Report, is considered one of the most demanding and high-profile roles in Australian television.  ABC viewers were shocked when Leigh Sales revealed in February she was stepping down as host. In the months leading up to her resignation, the single mother of two was reportedly struggling to balance her demanding job with homeschooling her children. Sales says her decision to quit came down to her 'two beautiful little boys' wanting to see more of their mum.  She told viewers she wanted them to hear the news from her 'personally', as she explained she wanted to finally spend evenings with her kids after more than a decade.  'I was appointed to the job on December 3, 2010. This is my 12th year in the seat. That was five Prime Ministers ago. It was so long ago that Donald Trump was just a guy with a bad orange hairdo hosting The Apprentice,' she said. 'There's nothing wrong other than I just feel a strong sense of it being time to pass the baton to the next runner in the race and to take a break. At the end of an election cycle feels like a good time to move on to something new at the ABC.' She said she hoped it was obvious she had always approached the job with one goal 'to ask frank questions of people in power, without fear or favour, that a fair-minded, reasonable person with some common sense watching at home might like to ask'. In a possible first for an Australian TV news presenter, she then used strong language, saying she had 'tried to shut down and call out bulls**t, hold powerful people to account, expose lies, incompetence and exaggeration in all political parties and all issues and present facts even when they're unpopular or inconvenient'.   Sales said anchoring 7.30 has been 'the most amazing job and I'll never stop being grateful for the opportunities it's given me'. She then mentioned one of her most memorable interviewees over the years. 'The celebrities come and go but you never forget people like Matthew Low,' Ms Sales said.

'People like Matthew are the ones who stick with you. 'Every time you interview somebody whose life has been devastated you feel terrified by what life has dished up to them and incredibly humbled by how they met it with strength and clarity and dignity and you just don't forget it.' She did single out one celebrity, though, saying meeting Paul McCartney 'and getting a hug from him is one of the best days of my life'. Ms Sales also mentioned the viewers and how people would approach her in public and say how much joy her interview with McCartney had given them. She spoke about what a demanding hosting 7.30 is and that it comes with a lot of pressure and scrutiny. 'When I first started I didn't have children. And now I have two boys aged 10 and eight. And they've only ever known their mum at work four nights a week. 'They want me home with them before 8.30pm and I don't think that's too much for two little boys to ask and they're two beautiful little boys.' Ms Sales also thanked viewers for their supportive messages about the ABC itself. 'The ABC is so often under fire and it means a lot to all of us to know the public supports us,' she said. She said that 7.30 'is an incredibly important program' and that it will keep going from strength to strength. 'I'm looking forward to having a good break and figuring out what I do next at the ABC ... I'm be around for a while yet.' She finished by saying 'Please keep watching, my friends. See you on Monday. Goodnight.'",

  "b2d0d4bb7c8c31ad8bb6faae913363cecb25d9ab8782669f11386cc6": "Vladimir Putin has launched a new dpuble missile attack at Kyiv during the visit of UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres just two days after he sat down with the Russian dictator in Moscow.  At least one person was killed and several injured, including some who were trapped beneath the rubble in the western part of the city centre, according to rescue officials. The bombardment came barely an hour after President Zelenskyy held a news conference with the UN Secretary-General, who said Ukraine has become 'an epicentre of unbearable heartache and pain.'  A spokesperson said Guterres and his team were safe. Guterres had visited Putin on Tuesday in order to discuss the urgent need for Russian forces to permit humanitarian corridors for civilian evacuations.  The missile strike can be viewed as Putin's non-diplomatic response to the request.  Mayor Vitali Klitschko said the Shevchenkivskyi district in the northwestern part of the city was hit twice, causing fires in at least two high-rise buildings.  AFP correspondents saw black smoke pouring into the air and a building in flames with a heavy presence of police and rescuers in the area. 'Missile strikes in the downtown of Kyiv during the official visit of @antonioguterres,' tweeted Mykhaylo Podolyak, a senior aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. 'The day before he was sitting at a long table in the Kremlin, and today explosions are above his head,' Mykhaylo said referring to Guterres' visit to Moscow where he met Russian President Vladimir Putin a few days ago. The United Nations chief and Ukrainian president had been out surveying the destruction in small towns outside the capital that saw some of the worst horrors of the first onslaught of the war.  At a press conference just before the missile strikes, Guterres condemned the atrocities committed in towns like Bucha, where evidence of mass killings of civilians was found after Russia retreated in the face of unexpectedly stiff resistance.  He said Ukraine has become 'an epicentre of unbearable heartache and pain.' 'Wherever there is a war, the highest price is paid by civilians,' Guterres lamented, reiterating the importance of investigating alleged war crimes.  Appearing to be one of boldest attacks on Kyiv since Russian forces retreated from around the capital weeks ago, the explosions came as residents have been increasingly returning to the city.  Cafes and other businesses have reopened, and a growing number of people have been out and enjoying the spring weather.  The strike on the Ukrainian capital comes as the Russian offensive in the Donbas region gathers steam.  Several areas came under heavy shelling Thursday, amid suspicions Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to score a major battlefield success in time for Victory Day, one of Russia's proudest holidays, on May 9. Ukrainian authorities reported intense Russian fire in the Donbas - the eastern industrial heartland that the Kremlin is bent on capturing - and near Kharkiv, a northeastern city outside the Donbas that is seen as key to the offensive.  In the ruined southern port city of Mariupol, Ukrainian fighters holed up in the steel plant that represents the last pocket of resistance said concentrated bombing overnight killed and wounded more people.  Authorities warned that a lack of safe drinking water inside the city could lead to outbreaks of deadly diseases. ",
  "153ba7dc138046c7a79c1b5a76d83a77fdc7092b8d089ff28bdf8e19": "The denial could not have been more emphatic. Three months ago, the Daily Mail asked if Angela Rayner had been at the infamous Durham bash where Sir Keir Starmer glugged beer with cronies. At the time, it was subject to a police inquiry amid claims Labour's leader had broken lockdown rules. The answer was blunt: Mrs Rayner - notorious for calling Tories 'scum' - was not there. This week, we discovered the opposite was true. Photographs revealed the deputy leader brazenly taking part in a Zoom rally at the constituency office. Confronted with this irrefutable evidence yesterday, Labour made a humiliating confession: They'd made a mistake. That the party has been caught shamelessly lying is emblematic of the rank hypocrisy pervading every aspect of this shifty affair. In politics - as in normal life - standards matter. Labour's leader certainly believes so. For months, he has launched scathing personal attacks on the Prime Minister over Partygate. Indeed, when Boris Johnson received a fine for attending what the police deemed a lockdown-busting birthday gathering, he almost burst with puce-faced piety. No matter that, in the midst of battling the pandemic that nearly killed him, Mr Johnson's colleagues presented him with a cake (which never left its Tupperware). For Sir Keir, this was a hanging offence. For flouting his own Covid rules, the PM should resign, he declared pompously. Boris did not 'tell the truth'. But now we know that when it comes to the highest standards, Sir Keir and his sermonising acolytes have got feet of clay. They supported the draconian laws with an almost religious fervour. Now Sir Keir faces damaging questions over the event last April when indoor socialising was banned. Was it coincidence that party members held an online 'quiz and social' event on the evening he was there? Risibly, he claims he was working. The very defence he called 'pathetic' when the PM used it. What a shameless hypocrite! No wonder senior Tories are demanding detectives review their controversial decision to clear him of wrongdoing. When the regulations should be interpreted consistently, the ruling smacks of double standards. And now we know that Labour's No 1 and 2 were at the scene, isn't it time the police woke up? Labour have banged on about the importance of uncovering the truth about Partygate. But when it comes to being held to account for their own potential rule-breaking, they lash out. How else to explain a Labour MP accosting a Tory backbencher in Parliament for having the temerity to ask the police to probe the Durham rally with the same rigour he demanded for the PM? If it was so innocent, they'd surely welcome a scrupulous investigation to put the matter to bed. Of course, this is not the first time Mrs Rayner has been caught out. When The Mail on Sunday reported that she had joked about flashing her legs to try to distract Mr Johnson during PMQs, she furiously denounced the story as untrue. How odd! Because she herself had earlier volunteered the information for a national podcast. And, as the Mail revealed, no fewer than four MPs - including one woman - say they heard her laughing about the same subject on the Commons terrace in January. Their powerful testimonies bring a unique force to this version of events. Yesterday was a day of sleaze and shame for Labour. An ex-Cabinet minister was suspended for bullying and a shadow minister was accused of making disgusting sexual innuendos about a female MP. For weeks, Labour MPs have clutched their metaphorical pearls so hard over Partygate their fingers have been in danger of breaking. Now we know they are just as bad.",

An official from a pro-Russian committee which styles itself as the region's 'military-civil administration' announced the move via Russian news agency RIA. Kirill Stremousov said the transition to the rouble will take up to four months, during which time it will circulate alongside Ukraine's official currency, the hryvnia. This week Russia said it had gained full control of the southern region. Russia appointed its own mayor in the city of Kherson on Tuesday after taking over regional headquarters. But Ukrainian mayor Ihor Kolykhayev said on Facebook he had defied Russian orders. 'I am staying in Kherson with the people of Kherson who entrusted me with the management of our city,' he added. 'I refused to cooperate with the new administration.' It was announced that the powers of 'Kherson mayor are delegated' pursuant to the order of the regional military commander of the Russian Federation to Oleksandr Kobets. He will in turn report to the new head of the 'Kherson regional administration', Volodymyr Saldo. Mr Kobets said that from this week he would coordinate all the processes that ensure the functioning of the city. Mr Kolykhayev said that he had asked the Ukrainian President's Office for detailed instructions on what the mayor and his colleagues should do in response to the current situation. It comes as Russian forces used tear gas and stun grenades to stamp out a pro-Ukraine rally in the occupied city on Wednesday. The protest had been organised on the day Kyiv said Russian planned to stage a referendum to create a breakaway region like those in eastern Ukraine. Thousands of people have fled Kherson to Ukraine-controlled territory amid water outages, severe shortages of food and medicines.",

Online posts claimed some of the women are 'wives and girlfriends' of servicemen fighting in Ukraine. Their snaps in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine were posted on Instagram and Russian social media site VK.

Jahden Nelson, 28, is fighting for his life in the burns unit at the Middlemore Hospital in Auckland, New Zealand. The young father suffered a heart attack and burns to 35 per cent of his body following an electrical shock at a Massey worksite last Tuesday. A neighbour said Mr Nelson was taking apart scaffolding and holding a steel pole when it touched a low-hanging powerline that electrocuted him. His mother, Toni Paikea, said the voltage was like an atomic bomb exploding in his body. 'It went from one arm, through the other arm and straight down through his leg and thigh,' she told NZ Herald. Mr Nelson's cousin held the unconscious tradie until paramedics arrived and took him to Auckland City Hospital. He underwent surgery before he was transferred to Middlemore Hospital. Ms Paikea said her son had both his arms amputated and that he could possibly lose. more limbs. Only one person is allowed to visit Mr Nelson at a time due to the increased risk of spreading infection.  'It's the hardest thing a parent could go through,' she said. 'It's a life and death situation. I'm holding my son's heart in my hands.'  Questions have been raised around the worksite safety with the family demanding answers as to why Mr Nelson was working beneath live wires. Ms Paikea said her son had been working in the industry for 12 years and that he was extremely knowledgeable of health and safety protocol. She claimed her son would have believed the powerlines had been cut off and that he would not have been working had they not been. Employer Supercity Scaffolding has offered to pay for a car park at the hospital and distribute food vouchers. Lines company Vector has also given the family $1,000 in fuel vouchers. WorkSafe has launched in an investigation into the incident. Ms Paikea has set up an online fundraiser to raise money for her son.

  "a2b5760b9e8343f38d16461b30a8e1ef89ee03da9d9f3e46b8e5349b": "William Tyrrell's foster parents will proceed to trial on charges of assaulting and stalking a child after it was revealed that police have a 'large amount of surveillance device material' and up to ten prosecution witnesses. Sydney's Hornsby Local Court heard on Friday that the little boy lost's foster mother will apply to have her charges heard under the Mental Health Act, while the foster father will not. The charges include stalking and intimidation offences against the foster parents which date from earlier this year. They relate to another child who is not William.  Police prosecutors today were criticised for not having a brief ready yet on a 'serious' charge of child assault which detectives laid against both the foster mother and father last November. The foster mother's lawyer Sharon Ramsden told the court she had not yet been able to get a mental health assessment appointment for the 57-year-old, which will determine if she qualifies to be judged as mentally impaired.  The foster father's lawyer Lauren MacDougall told the court she would not be pursuing a mental health application on his behalf.  Both foster parents will present just one witness each to defend the charges. The foster couple were facing court for the first time on charges of stalking the same child who police allege they assaulted last year, along with Apprehended Violence Orders taken out by police for the child against the parents. The foster father is accused of one count of stalking and intimidation intending fear of physical harm against a child, while the foster mother faces two charges. Police allege the assault against the child, whose identity cannot be revealed for legal reasons, occurred last year.   The identities of the foster parents - well-educated professionals in their 50s who live in a comfortable suburb on Sydney's north shore - can also not be publicly revealed.   The new charges came as the NSW Police Force continues to focus on what happened to William, who vanished from his grandparent's home in Kendall, NSW, on September 12, 2014. The foster parents had been charged with assault and intimidation of a child and with lying to the NSW Crime Commission last November.   The stalking charges followed former NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller naming the foster mother as a 'person of interest' in the toddler's disappearance.  The shift in the focus in trying to solve Australia's biggest unsolved murder mystery occurred after Strike Force Rosann head Gary Jubelin was replaced by Detective Chief Inspector David Laidlaw. Although police did not formally interview the foster father until six days after William disappeared, Mr Jubelin conducted separate gruelling three-hour interviews with them in 2017, three years after the toddler vanished. Mr Jubelin later said he had 'confidence' they were not involved. in 2019, two years after those interviews, the foster parents testified before the NSW Coroner's inquest into the missing boy. The focus of the inquiry was on a Kendall neighbour who has since been discounted as a person of interest and on convicted paedophiles of the NSW mid-north coast.  The foster mother gave evidence over two days, while the foster father gave shorter testimony of about an hour.  The foster mother's lawyer, high-profile Sydney solicitor Sharon Ramsden, told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday her client would likely plead not guilty to the stalking charge. Ms Ramsden said the woman would also plead not guilty to another charge of falsifying information to the NSW Crime Commission, just weeks after her husband was laid with the same charge. The 57-year-old was issued with a court attendance notice by NSW Homicide detectives, and has been ordered to appear at the Downing Centre on May 24. The charges of stalking and intimidation intending fear of physical or mental harm are domestic related, according to court documents.  While the investigation into the toddler's 2014 disappearance continues, the couple  held a fire sale of children's bikes, car seats, prams, furniture and industrial equipment with items ranging between $5 and several thousand. It was only revealed last month that William's foster father had been charged in January with two counts of 'knowingly providing false and misleading evidence'.  The charges only came to light because of a revision of non-publication orders surrounding the case.  The foster father, who police claim 'lied about something we can prove', gave the allegedly false evidence to the NSW Crime Commission late last year, and it is understood the foster mother also testified around the same time.    Details of the evidence provided to the NSW Crime Commission by the foster father which police claim is false and misleading are unavailable. The foster father has entered pleas of not guilty to both charges.  He testified for up to two hours after being secretly summonsed to appear at the Crime Commission's Surry Hills headquarters on November 11. This was four days before NSW Police launched a surprise 'high intensity' search of bushland around 800m from the house where William had been staying with his foster parents when he vanished seven years ago.  On the second day of the search for William's remains at a dig site in Kendall, the boy's foster mother was declared a person of interest in his disappearance.     Last month, William's foster mother was charged with another count of common assault of a child, which also does not relate to William, and her lawyer has indicated she will plead not guilty.  William had been placed with the couple in March 2012 as a foster child in the care of the then state minister for family and community services until he was 18 years old. William was driven to the Kendall home of his foster grandmother on Friday, September 11, 2014 and was last seen playing on the verandah of the house on the Saturday morning. A widespread search in the surrounding area failed to find any trace of him.  Last November, a new and extensive search for William's remains at Kendall began  and continued for four weeks. Police, SES and rural fire workers along with detectives from Strike Force Rosann spent four weeks late last year digging up a section of forest less than a kilometre from the house where William vanished. Combing bushland and digging with excavators, police searched along Batar Creek Road, Kendall for William's remains and scraps from the SpiderMan suit he was last seen wearing.  The foster mother denied any involvement in William's disappearance and no charges have ever been laid against any person.",

Miquiel Guerrero, 23, was arrested on March 30 after he and five others surrounded the unidentified victim, 53, and his car after they crashed into each other on Exterior Street in the Grand Concourse neighborhood. A man cops say is Guerrero was then filmed brutally-attacking his victim while wearing knuckle-dusters while his posse jumped on the man's car and stole it. The van driver made no attempt to fight back.   Shockingly, Guerrero has since been freed back onto the streets, despite the horrific nature of the violence meted out on his alleged victim. He's due back in court May 23 on a misdemeanor charge, amid ongoing fury over New York's soft-on-crime laws that critics blame for a recent spike in violent crime.  Surveillance footage shows the group circling the victim, with one jumping on top of the car, as Guerrero swings the driver's door open and begins to violently punch the victim.  Police records indicate Guerrero wrapped a metal object around his knuckles when he pummeled the man, who suffered a shattered left eye and bruising in the face, nose and back. Officials did not specify what the object Guerroro used was.  It is also unclear if he has any prior convictions.   After being beaten, the 53-year-old can be seen running away from the scene and two men enter his Kia and begin to drive off with it. While three others hop in an unoccupied Honda that was caught in the crash, according to the New York Post.   Guerrero, who stayed on the scene for unknown reasons, was later arrested and charged with assault, menacing, criminal possession of a weapon and harassment.  Police are now looking for the other group members, all aged between 18 and 25, according to authorities.  The victim was transported to Jacobi Medical Center and was treated for a fractured eye socket and facial cuts.   It comes as New York is in the middle of a crime surge, with overall crime up 42 percent. The Big Apple is an increasing problem with carjacking up 68 percent and felony assaults up 21 percent.  Earlier this month, NYC Police Commissioner Keechant L. Sewell 'this is not what New Yorkers expect or deserve, and we will not stand for it' as crime continues to terrorize New Yorkers.  'It's clear what we are confronting: A perception among criminals that there are no consequences, even for serious crime. We need tangible changes,' added Sewell.  NYC Mayor Eric Adams has now vowed to crack down on transit crimes, which is up more than 60 percent, but also lazy officers patrolling subway stations.  Adams made the plea at a press conference Tuesday when asked by a journalist about reports of multiple uniformed cops being spotted scrolling through phones while on duty guarding the city's crime-ridden transport network. The former NYPD captain warned: 'We are going to start taking very aggressive actions to make sure police are patrolling our subway system and not patrolling their iPhone.' 'If you see it, send me a picture. I'll go to that district the next day and see exactly what is happening. 'Send me a shot. New Yorkers, you see that send me a photo and I will be at that station.' Adams spokesman told anyone with photos to send them to his press office, whose email address is pressoffice@cityhall.nyc.gov. Adams said that New Yorkers can look forward to a 'visible difference in policing in the next couple of weeks.' ",
  "cda67d635f27fc3da3a67da71dd77d7aa5063001e5304567b3a7e618": "Lawyers for the man accused of shooting 10 people on a Brooklyn subway have accused the FBI of violating his rights by swabbing him for DNA and making him sign papers without informing his attorneys.  Frank James, 62, is charged with conducting a violent attack on a mass transportation vehicle following the April 12 attack. He faces life in prison if convicted. Arrested on April 13, James is currently being held without bail in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, and James's lawyers claim that on Tuesday FBI agents entered his cell and questioned him, without following proper procedures. Mia Eisner-Grynberg and Deirdre von Dornum of the Federal Defenders of New York filed a complaint on Thursday, claiming that the FBI entered James's cell for questioning without alerting them before or after. They also took swabs of the inside of his mouth for DNA, made him sign documents, and failed to provide James with a receipt for the interaction.  Further details on the nature of the questioning, or the reason for the swab, have not been revealed.   'Contrary to standard practice, the government committed this intrusion absent advance notice to counsel, depriving us of an opportunity to be heard or to be present,' his lawyers wrote. 'Neither did the government provide subsequent notice to counsel.  'The agents did not provide Mr James with a copy of the warrant or a receipt, in violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure.' Prosecutors from the Eastern District of New York have been given a week to explain. James's lawyers said they would ask the court to withdraw from file whatever statements he made in his Tuesday interview with the FBI. They also asked the judge to order the government to turn over a copy of the affidavit that served as the basis for the search.  Prosecutors say James staged a premeditated attack when he shot ten people and injured others on the northbound N train at around 8.25am on April 12, during rush hour.  James, dressed in a construction worker's vest and helmet, donned a gas mask and rolled smoke grenades into the carriage before opening fire. Videos from the scene showed hundreds of commuters frantically running for the exits as shots were fired.  A nearly 24-hour long manhunt for James then ensued, with the Bronx-born, Milwaukee-based suspect ultimately arrested while strolling down the street on April 13. In court documents the next day, prosecutors detailed how more ammunition was found in James' rented Philadelphia apartment, including an extended round magazine that was fit for a semi-automatic rifle. No such firearm has been found yet in connection with the suspect.  His 9mm handgun was found at the 36th Street subway station after the attack, along with spent shell casings, fireworks, and a key to his U-Haul.  Police also searched a storage unit in Philadelphia, where he was keeping more ammunition, a torch and a gun silencer.  There was a propane gas tank in the U-Haul when police swooped in on it hours after the attack.  James dumped the truck five miles from the 36th Street subway. He was filmed walking away. James' motive remains unknown.  James had a criminal history extending back to 1992, when he pleaded guilty to attempted petit larceny and was known to the FBI's Guardian Program, which tracks terror threats and suspects, over an incident in New Mexico in 2019.  At the time, he was cleared of wrongdoing.   But in a YouTube video posted just one day before the attack, James said he wanted to harm people. 'I can say I wanted to kill people. I wanted to watch people die,' he said.  Other videos featured James ranting about discrimination and complaining about white people.  They are now being closely examined by law enforcement. Mayor Eric Adams has suggested that it was the responsibility of YouTube to monitor the videos and report them. 'There's a corporate responsibility hen we are watching hate brew online,' Adams said.  'We can identify [hate] using artificial intelligence and other methods to identify those who are talking about violence.' Critics accused Adams of passing the buck, noting that the surveillance cameras in the station were not working - allowing James to flee - and that NYPD failed to find him, despite his wandering around Manhattan for almost 24 hours after the attack and eventually calling the police himself.

  "99cd42b33a357c41d6976fd081a253dbb1074f8280eb7893b169cdf5": "New video of scandal-ridden GOP Rep Madison Cawthorn having his crotch felt by a close male friend and staff member is at the center of a complaint calling for an investigation into him and filed with the Office of Congressional Ethics today, DailyMail.com can reveal. The extraordinary footage, obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com and seen here for the first time today, shows Cawthorn, 26, in a car with his close aide and his scheduler Stephen Smith, 23. Cawthorn sits in the driver's seat apparently filmed by Smith as he adopts an exaggerated accent and says, 'I feel the passion and desire and would like to see a naked body beneath my hands.' The camera then pans back to Smith who says, 'Me too' as Cawthorn can be heard laughing. Smith then films himself reaching his hand over and into Cawthorn's crotch. The video is one of several exhibits filed in support of the ethics complaint drafted by political group Fire Madison Cawthorn. Cawthorn appeared to allude to the scandal on Thursday in a tweet which said: 'Many of my colleagues would be nowhere near politics if they had grown up with a cell phone in their hands.'  The complaint calls for an investigation into a slew of behaviors that, the group alleges, has put Cawthorn firmly on the wrong side of a host of House Rules. Among the many allegations is the claim that representative for North Carolina's 11th district provided thousands of dollars in loans and gifts to Smith, a staff member, with whom, the complaint states, he is engaged in an improper relationship characterized by steamy postings on social media and so close that the staffer joined Cawthorn on his honeymoon to Dubai in April 2021. According to the filing Cawthorn has provided free housing, travel and loans to Smith, none of which have been declared or repaid. The complaint also requests an investigation into the nature of Cawthorn's relationship with Smith stating that the junior member of staff lives with Cawthorn. A campaign payment to Smith submitted in Cawthorn's FEC filing and attached to the complaint gives Cawthorn's Hendersonville North Carolina house as Smith's home address and DailyMail.com has separately verified that Smith is indeed registered as living there. In addition to this living arrangement the filing claims that, 'various social media postings by them indicate a personal relationship between them, separate and apart from the professional relationship of employer and employee.' In fact, according to the ethics complaint, Smith's relationship with Cawthorn is so close that the younger man joined Cawthorn on his honeymoon to Dubai in April 2021. Approached for comment Cawthorn's spokesman Luke Ball said he could not give any response until he had seen the video. He said Smith and Cawthorn are cousins. A picture included in the exhibits filed in support of the call for an ethics investigation appears to show Cawthorn and Smith, poolside. Cawthorn lounges covered with only a towel, his arm draped over Smith who rests his head on his boss's shoulder and places his hand on Cawthorn's hip. Another picture shows the men enjoying a 'snow day' together with Smith sitting next to Cawthorn on an ATV, his arm placed around Cawthorn's shoulder. Cawthorn, who is confined to a wheelchair following a 2014 car accident, married Cristina Bayardelle, 27, in April 2021, just weeks after he had been accused of sexual harassment by a number of former students at Patrick Henry College, the northern Virginia college he attended in 2016 for just one semester. At the time Cawthorn described marrying the 27-year-old anesthesiologist assistant and CrossFit athlete as, 'the greatest honor, privilege and adventure of my life.' The pair were married in a private ceremony in front of a large wooden cross, garlanded with flowers. Cawthorn stood with the aid of a walker and exoskeleton to make his vows and kiss his bride. Bayardelle, originally from Florida, claimed she knew 'he was the one' after just four months of dating. But eight months later, in December 2021, the couple announced they were divorcing with Cawthorn placing the blame for the split on his elevation to political office. 'When my wife Cristina and I were engaged I was not a member of Congress. I felt called to serve and we both agreed that I should run,' he said in a press statement released at the time. He claimed they had sought counseling to deal with the 'enormity' of the change his election brought to his life but that ultimately, they had agreed to split when they realized that 'balance was not attainable,' and 'that we had irreconcilable differences between us.' Records reviewed by DailyMail.com show that Smith was living at Cawthorn's Hendersonville, North Carolina, home throughout the representative's brief marriage. A Venmo payment history between Smith and Cawthorn, attached to the ethics filing and dating from June 2018 is littered with suggestive messages in the form of notes attached to the payments. One payment made by Cawthorn to Smith and dated June 17, 2018, reads, 'Getting naked for me in Sweden.' Another made by the representative to his staff member four days later reads, 'The stuff we did in Amsterdam.' The following day on June 21 Cawthorn made a payment to Smith for, 'The quickie at the airport.' Four days later Smith makes a payment to Cawthorn 'For loving me daily and nightly.' One note on a payment made by Smith to Cawthorn on December 13, 2018, reads simply, 'Nudes.' It is not clear if the two twenty-somethings added those tags as a joke. Cawthorn, who represents a wide swath of western North Carolina in Congress, is the youngest member of Congress in more than half a century.  He has become an increasingly embattled figure in recent weeks during which there has been what Fire Madison Cawthorn co-founder David Wheeler calls a 'deluge' of scandal. Leaked pictures emerged in which he was seen, possibly intoxicated, wearing women's lingerie at a party. Two recent speeding violations - one for 'extreme speeding' another for driving on a revoked license - have brought his tally of citations to more than a dozen with court dates looming. On Tuesday he was stopped at Charlotte's Douglas International Airport attempting to take a loaded Staccato C2 handgun through TSA in his carry-on. Last year he was stopped trying to board a flight at Asheville Airport with a Glock 9mm handgun that was not only loaded but had a round chambered and ready to fire. On Wednesday North Carolina Republican Senator Thom Tillis called for him to be investigated for insider trading over his relationship with meme cryptocurrency Let's Go Brandon. Last December Cawthorn posted an Instagram picture of himself with LGB leader James Koutolas and the caption, 'LGB legends...Tomorrow we go to the moon!' The following day NASCAR driver Brandon Brown announced that the cryptocurrency would be his primary sponsor for the 2022 season and its value spiked by 75 percent. Tillis has asserted that this suggests that Cawthorn who owned the cryptocurrency was aware of the development in advance and called for an investigation. It is all just part of what Tillis, 61, has called Cawthorn's, 'consistent pattern of juvenile behavior, outlandish statements and untruthfulness.' This apparent 'untruthfulness' reached a new level when he told a right-wing YouTube channel host that unnamed Republicans in Washington, 'in their 60s and 70s' had invited him to 'orgies' and that he had witnessed them snorting cocaine. A red-faced Cawthorn was forced to admit that this was an 'exaggeration' after a 30-minute tongue-lashing from the Republican minority leader, Kevin McCarthy. For his part McCarthy called the stories, 'untrue' and said that the once-rising star had lost his trust and needed to 'turn his life around.' According to Wheeler, while much of the scandal has tumbled out over the past few days, his group's desire to speed Cawthorn's downfall predates it. Wheeler told DailyMail.com, 'This all started pre lingerie, pre speeding, pre the guns...there's been a deluge of things recently but [Cawthorn's behavior] is not recent. He's been doing this stuff for a while.' He added, 'We stick to the facts. We don't do conjecture. Essentially what's happened is he's been violating House ethical rules first of all by providing free housing for one of his staff. 'You can't gift more than $250 to a friend and House rules say you can't give gifts to other House staff. 'But it's tens of thousands of dollars because the guy - Stephen L Smith - has lived in his [Cawthorn's] house here in Hendersonville at least since he took office.' In addition to their concerns about Cawthorn's alleged gifts and loans to Smith and the nature of his relationship with his staffer the Fire Madison Cawthorn complaint has also called for an investigation into both of his attempts to bring loaded firearms onto flights and an attempt to bring a '4.45inch dagger' to North Carolina public educational property on four documented occasions. All these actions are, the complaint asserts, violations of House Rule XXIII and reflect negatively upon the House. The filing has also called for a separate investigation into Smith who, as the recipient of free housing and travel from Cawthorn in excess of $250 as well as gifts and loans, has allegedly failed to submit proper House financial disclosures. Ultimately, Wheeler told DailyMail.com that the group is motivated by a desire to 'hold Cawthorn accountable' for behavior that, he says, has escalated to the point where Cawthorn is a danger to himself and others. He said, 'We began working on this around April 2021 with the sole purpose of holding Cawthorn accountable. 'Think about [what's happened recently]. It's not hyperbole to say that this guy's a danger to the public with his driving and his guns. 'The gun [in the airport] was loaded - both times - and one of them was chambered so it was ready to go! 'Somebody's going to get hurt. This guy is either going to kill somebody or he's going to kill himself through his irresponsible actions and that's the worst part of it and I don't think he has any clue. 'He just seems completely in his own world and detached from reality in a way that's [become] frightening.'",
  "efa5102781d1d178810476a609c7f96436e2ebc28319241c55bab9d3": "Vladimir Putin is secretly plotting to seize food in occupied areas of Ukraine to fill shelves in Russia after Western sanctions sparked crippling shortages. The plan was accidentally revealed by a Kremlin puppet parliament, which said Moscow will confiscate crops from farmers to help stock stores across Russia. It will revive the horrors of Ukraine's Holodomor, or 'hunger extermination', when Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin stole food to create the 1932-1933 famine, killing at least four million people. In a now-deleted statement, pro-Putin regional politician Vladislav Zyryanov said the Kremlin wanted 'to increase the volume of supplies for domestic Russian consumers by moving food from other southern [Ukrainian] regions taken under its control'. Zyryanov, who chairs the agriculture committee in the Krasnoyarsk regional assembly in Siberia, called the move 'economically justified, given the withdrawal of many suppliers of seeds and fertilisers from the Russian market'. He suggested other regions across Russia will be able to 'successfully implement' similar policies to address the nation's food supply woes. His remarks are the first time any Russian official has openly admitted Russia wants to steal Ukrainian farm produce. They also amount to an unprecedented acknowledgement by Putin's United Russia party of the biting effect from sanctions imposed by Britain and its Western allies. Zyryanov's statement was hurriedly taken down from the Krasnoyarsk assembly's website late on Wednesday. Both the UN and EU have accused Russia of using hunger as a weapon of war by bombing food stocks and blocking deliveries of humanitarian supplies. It is why the record-breaking Mail Force Ukraine Appeal and the Ukrainian Embassy in London are sending 500,000 boxes of food aid worth PS8million to end the suffering of Ukrainians. Kherson's highly productive and lucrative agriculture industry is one of the reasons why Ukraine is referred to as the world's bread basket. In the admission, desperate Siberian MPs said the move to steal Ukrainian 'crop surpluses' was necessary due to 'the lack of other vegetables and grain crops' in the eastern Russian region. But they added that foreign sanctions had created similar shortages 'everywhere at the federal level'. Albert Cherepakha, owner of two major farming businesses in Kherson, described how his firms have been seized by 'groups of armed Chechens'. He said: 'The gunmen said that from now on the company property belongs to them.' He added his managers 'were warned that they would be beheaded in case of any losses'. And Oleksandr Boyko, 23, a Kherson farm worker, said there had been 'no significant excess production' of vegetable, fruit and grain products. The Ukraine Agri Council, representing Ukrainian farmers, said last night Russian invaders had started seizing grain from the Zaporizhzhia region. Ukraine's food exports have slumped in the two months since the war started, causing prices to spike worldwide by at least 37 per cent, according to the World Bank. Dr Samuel Ramani, a Russia expert at the University of Oxford, said regional MPs in Russia never 'act out of lockstep' with the Kremlin on issues of national security. Just over two years ago, all 85 regional parliaments backed constitutional changes that will allow Putin to run again for presidency in 2024. Dr Ramani said: 'When a regional parliament is speaking, it is reflecting the Kremlin line and revealing Vladimir Putin's true intentions in Ukraine. He sees this area and all of its resources effectively as an extension of Russian territory. 'From his point of view, there is no difference between taking something out of Kherson or drilling for oil in Siberia.' The Kremlin's press office could not be immediately reached for comment.

  "590d8eedf9c4795a66a6b1de59fda56706c25b3c5f13c5598c80d6f0": "Blac Chyna's mother branded the Kardashians as a 'violent' family that is trying to paint her and her daughter as 'crazy people' at Chyna's ongoing defamation trial.  'I mean they are the most violent people,' Tokyo Toni said of the Kardashian-Jenner family while standing outside a Los Angeles courthouse where her daughter's defamation trial was underway on Thursday. 'You can turn it on and see.' 'Any of them, all of them,' she argued, noting how Kris Jenner's adult daughters are often seen disrespecting her on their family show, Keeping Up With the Kardashians. Tokyo, seemingly hinting at her social media rant that resulted in her removal from the courtroom, also denounced the accusations that she and Chyna are 'crazy people'. 'They are the most violent people. They have me and her like we're these crazy people, no we're just standing up for our rights,' Tokyo stated. 'Doing what we're supposed to do as real people. It has nothing to do with race, color. None of that. It's what's right.' Chyna, 33, is suing Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner for defamation, alleging they conspired to cast her as a violent abuser of her former fiance Rob Kardashian to ruin her television career. Tokyo, 55, was banned from attending the hearings hours after jury selection began when she took to Instagram Live detailing what went down in the courtroom. She also allegedly said 'those b**ches ugly' when referring to the Kardashian-Jenners. The Kardashians' lawyer presented Tokyo's comments to the courtroom the next day, alleging she had threatened the family and that 'Ms. Jenner was worried about her physical safety.' Tokyo's commentary comes just two days after Chyna's defamation trial heard testimony that the model had allegedly beaten Rob Kardashian with a metal rod. Rob, 35, testified Tuesday that he feared for his life on a night in 2016 when Chyna, his then-fiancee, pointed a gun at his head, pulled a phone-charging cable around his neck and repeatedly hit him with a metal rod while under the influence of substances. He said the coupling was 'toxic' from the start, and that Chyna beat him at least five times during the year-long relationship.  'She strangled me, she put a gun to my head twice, she was on cocaine and alcohol,' Kardashian said, his voice rising nearly to a shout in a Los Angeles courtroom as Chyna's attorney Lynne Ciani sought to cast doubt on the attack and its severity. 'Strangling someone, beating someone, that's not a family,' he said. 'That's not love to me.' He told the courtroom that he felt in retrospect that the couple's love was never real, and that he had been at the 'weakest, worst point' in his life when their relationship began in January 2016. Rob's sister, Kim Kardashian, echoed the tale, claiming that she remembered him being 'so emotional and upset' after the alleged attack. The E! Network, which aired both Keeping up with the Kardashians, and its spinoff Rob and Chyna, paid Chyna $370,000 to film four episodes of KUWTK after season one of the latter show ended. But that deal was inked without consulting the Kardashians, said Kim who protested in an email that at E!, 'Nobody listens to us...No one respects us', the court heard.  She then reportedly urged her sisters in a text to 'get on the phone today' with E! executives following the December 2016 fight. 'I was upset that Rob was so emotional and upset,' the Kim, 41, explained to jurors at Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday. 'I remember trying to be supportive of my brother - he was being so emotional.' 'It's all such a blur,' she said, remembering that her brother, Rob, 'looked red and puffy and exhausted and drained.' Kim added: 'It was our show and she's not a family member.' Khloe Kardashian, 37, confirmed her sister's allegations on Tuesday, testifying that she too was worried about 'something crazy happening down the line' if there were a second season of the KUWTK spin-off.  'I know it was a metal rod. I saw red indentations on my brother's neck,' Khloe recalled, adding that her family had 'no control' of whether E! would cancel Chyna's contract - a claim later confirmed by Adam Stotsky, the former president of the network. 'With all due respect to [the Kardashians], they do not have the authority to kill Rob and Chyna, only E! has the power to do that,' Stotsky said in court. Kylie Jenner, 24, also testified to Chyna's alleged violent tendencies, telling the jury on Monday that she expressed concerns to her brother Rob about his new girlfriend and soon-to-be reality TV co-star when they started dating in January 2016. The beauty mogul claimed she heard Chyna had a tendency to abuse drugs and alcohol and become violent and had gotten a possible glimpse of it herself. 'I felt it was my duty to express my concerns, but ultimately it was up to him,' Kylie recalled, noting her brother didn't heed her warnings and continued with the relationship. Both Chyna and Kylie had previous relationships with the rapper Tyga, and Chyna had a child with him.  Kylie alleged that Tyga told her dark stories of his time with Chyna and showed her a 6-inch knife scar he said she gave him while abusing drugs and alcohol. The model also claimed that while dating Tyga, she had received at least one threatening text message from Chyna. 'From what I remember she sent me a bunch of devil emojis, and said something like 'counting down the days' until she could beat me or something,' Kylie shared. 'I didn't report it, because I assumed they were empty threats.' She also said didn't trust that Chyna's love was genuine. 'I felt like me dating the father of her child had something to do with it, and maybe she was out with my brother for other reasons?' Still, she said, she was cautiously optimistic after they announced in April 2016 that they were getting engaged, and said in May that they were having a baby together. 'I was happy for my brother at the time,' Kylie said, 'but just curious how it would go.' Judge Gregory W. Alarcon, who is residing over the defamation trial, made the decision Thursday afternoon to move on to closing arguments after denying Chyna's bid to redo her testimony against the Kardashians. The model had became upset and walked off the stand during her testimony last week when she was shown a nude photo of herself during cross-examination.  The photo had appeared in a restraining order she received against Rob in 2017. The Kardashians' attorney showed her the document with the photo during his questioning of her. The judge said both sides agreed to all the exhibits, including the restraining order, before the trial. Chyna's attorney Lynne Ciani said she didn't agree to it in that form, stating: 'I emphatically insisted that the naked photo not be presented to the plaintiff.' The photo is central to another trial that will begin soon after this one concludes. Chyna is suing Rob over it, alleging he posted it online out of retribution. After he denied Chyna's to take the stand again, Alarcon began reading the jury instructions in the case late Thursday morning.  Closing arguments were expected to begin, and be completed, in the afternoon.  Chyna is charging the Kardashians with defamation and 'intentional interference with contract' that led to the KUWTK spinoff being canceled and is seeking $108million in damages. She claims she the decision resulted in $44million in past lost revenues and $64million in future.",
  "6d48c409bc8721ff940e720f0b4a5a926a29c54bf699b42061c497c0": "Former Disney CEO Michael Eisner appears set to unload his own Magic Kingdom as his California property is set to be up for a massive sale.  The Malibu compound, which features 16 bedrooms and a stunning nine guest houses, is now on the market for what would be a state record $225million. Eisner, 80 - who now runs Tornante Pictures and is Chairman of English League One football club Portsmouth - originally bought the first piece of land in the mid-1990s and have been adding adjacent land parcels ever since. The estate, designed by architect Robert A.M. Stern, includes nine separate structures, including a main house and several guesthouses. It also features a movie theater that can only be accessed by a tunnel. It has a stunning total of 16 bedrooms and 28 bathrooms across the main house and guesthouses, as well as a two-bedroom caretaker's cottage.  Kurt Rappaport, the listing agent, told the Wall Street Journal the cost was warranted because the entire scale of the compound would be nearly impossible to replicate today in terms of location and beach access.  Rappaport, who represents Westside Estate Agency, said that the property has an oceanfront cabana that can only be accessed by a cliff-side elevator.  The estate was gradually constructed over a period of decades and finally finished in 2020. The finishing of the project is behind Eisner's desire to sell, according to Rappaport, who said that the ex-Disney CEO 'loves the creative process' and wants to find a new project.  Eisner also owns a ranch in Snowmass, Colorado, a mansion in Bel-Air and an apartment on the Upper East Side of New York.  Other homes in the Malibu area have sold for shocking prices in recent years. In 2018, a property owned by Hard Rock Cafe founder Peter Morton sold for $110million.  Eisner ran Disney from 1984 to 2005, overseeing a revitalization of the studio from films like Who Framed Roger Rabbit to the famous 90s animation renaissance of The Little Mermaid, The Lion King and Pocahontas.  He also worked at Disney acquired everything from Miramax Pictures to ABC to ESPN and Pixar.  After Disney, Eisner has The Tornante Company, which has invested in everything from Topps baseball cards (which they sold to Fanatics earlier this year) to television shows like Netflix's Bojack Horsemen. He also hosted a talk show, Conversations with Michael Eisner, from 2006 to 2009 on CNBC. Since 2017, he has served as owner of Portsmouth FC, who play in the third tier of the English football system.  ",
  "907fb802b19ab1d8cba89b64d3c68bd4cbf3bfe347581510fbb3dd42": "Disney has restored a gay kiss scene in its new movie Lightyear after a furious backlash from staff, as the firm continues to tussle with Florida over Governor Ron DeSantis's so-called Don't Say Gay bill. The kiss happens between Buzz Lightyear's friend Alisha Hawthorne (Uzo Aduba) and another female character within the first 30 minutes of the film, which was shown to audiences at CinemaCon on Wednesday.  They subsequently confirmed that the smooch had been restored.   Hawthorne reportedly meets her love interest after her and Buzz land on a strange planet and later alludes to her getting married to her. She reportedly can be heard saying: 'It's funny, I wouldn't have met her if we hadn't been stranded,' according to USA Today.   The kiss was previous removed from the film before being reinstated after workers at Pixar Studios - which is owned by Disney - sent a letter to Disney CEO Bob Chapek, accusing the company of hiding same-sex affection.  'Nearly every moment of overtly gay affection is cut at Disney's behest, regardless of when there is protest from both the creative teams and executive leadership at Pixar. Even if creating LGBTQIA+ content was the answer to fixing the discriminatory legislation in the world, we are being barred from creating it,' Pixar employees wrote in a March letter to the company.  In addition, at least four recent feature films were altered to appease the views of leadership in China, Russia and the Middle East.  Sources close to the production told Variety that while Hawthorne's relationship was never questioned, studio execs opted to axe the kiss in an apparent move to avoid controversy. Insiders allege the decision to keep the kiss could be a turning point for Pixar, which has only featured a handful of 'unambiguous LGBTQ characters' in its 27-year history. But, it remains unknown if Disney will opt to censor the scene for its international markets after its release this upcoming June.  The company has previously kept moments of LGBT affection in its American films, but removed or changed them in its more conservative markets, including in Russia and the Middle East.  Pixar released Onward, an animated feature that tells the tale of two elf brothers who embark on a magical quest to spend time with their late father, in February 2020. The film included a secondary character, Officer Spector, a cyclops cop for the city of New Mushroomton, who was in a lesbian relationship.  Officer Spector, voiced by Lena Waithe, mentions her relationship during a parenting discussion with another secondary character: 'It's not easy being a new parent - my girlfriend's daughter got me pulling my hair out, okay?' The line sparked outrage is several eastern countries, resulting in a ban of its release in Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, Deadline reported. Russia, which has a history of censoring gay content, changed the word 'girlfriend' to 'partner' in the parenting scene. Local advertisements for the film also avoided mentioning Officer's Spector's gender.  Meanwhile, members of the LGBT community have heralded Officer Spector as Disney's first openly gay character.  The Marvel franchise, which is owned by Disney, included a same-sex kiss in Eternals, a November 2021 superhero film based on the Marvel Comics race of the same name. The character of Phastos, the inventor of the community of genetically-engineered Eternals, is married to a man named Ben Stoss. Together the pair raise a son, Jack. In one scene, Phastos is seen kissing Ben. But, according to Out.com, that moment was edited out for audiences in the Arab Emirates, Egypt, Lebanon, Iraq, Jordan, Ethiopia, Palestine, Syria and Turkey. The countries did, however, keep other scenes in which Phastos interacts with his husband and son. It is unclear if the familial relations between the characters were defined. Out.com notes that in addition to the same-sex kiss, all scenes of physical intimacy, including those depicting heterosexual relationships, were also removed from the film, which is standard practice in those countries.  Another Marvel film, Avengers: Endgame, which was released in 2019 and grossed nearly $3billion worldwide, was also censored abroad. Early on in the film, there is a brief scene in which a gay character attends a support group meeting with Captain America. 'So, I went on a date the other day. First time in five years,' the character said, before adding later: 'He cried as they were serving the salad. But I'm seeing him again tomorrow.' It was the first time an openly gay character appeared in a Marvel film.  According to Russian newspaper TJournal, the nation's dubbed version of Endgame changed the dialogue to remove 'romantic overtones'.  In the Russian version, the character says: 'I was recently at dinner. First time in five years. [...] He cried over a plate of salad. [...] Tomorrow I'm meeting him again.' The newspaper also claimed Disney may have changed dialogue in Marvel's 2018 film Avengers: Infinity War to avoid additional conflict with the Russian government, however it is unclear what the nature of the dialogue was. Similarly, Pixar was accused of downplaying gay tones in its 2021 film Luca, which details the friendship of two young sea monsters who appear human when on land. The monsters, Luca and Alberto, develop a 'profound friendship' that many interpreted as a 'coming out allegory'. The film's director told The Wrap the studio had 'talked about' the monsters' relationship being romantic, but also noted officials 'didn't talk about it as much' because the film focuses 'on friendship' and is 'pre-romance.' 'Some people seem to get mad that I'm not saying yes or no, but I feel like, well, this is a movie about being open to any difference,' director Enrico Casarosa added.  Disney has reportedly refused to confirm if the pair were in a gay romance. The films bosses are also accused of having toyed with the idea of making character Giulia, a human girl who befriends Luca and Alberto, a lesbian but decided against it because the creative team was 'stymied by how to do it without also creating a girlfriend for the character.' 'We very often came up against the question of, 'How do we do this without giving them a love interest?'' a production source told Variety. 'That comes up very often at Pixar.' Disney has also been accused of cutting the majority of inclusive scenes in the 2022 Pixar film Turning Red, which was a coming of age story about puberty. Pixar employees allege there was misrepresentation in the animated film and that it was riddled with 'ambiguous possibly gay hinting,' according to InsideTheMagic. Several employees have called on the studio to 'release the Gay Cut' of the film. It is unclear what specifically the alleged gay scenes depicted, however critics have posted stills to social media of scenes in which two female characters have their faces just inches apart. Disney came out against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis's so-called 'Don't Say Gay' bill, whose official title is the Parental Rights in Education Bill, last month after facing immense pressure from staff members. The bill prohibits public school instruction on gender and sexuality between kindergarten and third grade. Supporters say the bill, which was signed into law in March, stops teachers from pushing inappropriate content on children, which they believe students may be too young to understand. Opponents say the bill is homophobic, and that the vagueness of its wording could see a teacher reported to authorities for something as minor as mentioning their same-sex partner in class. Disney initially stayed quiet on the bill. But the firm - which has long had a good track record on supporting its LGBT staff - is said to have waded into the issue after being pressured by woke in-house diversity factions now said to exert growing influence over bosses there. CEO Bob Chapek later spoke out after walkouts by a small number of Disney staffers - and angered DeSantis by openly suggesting that his firm would apply pressure on lawmakers. After blasting the bill, he said: 'As I wrote to our employees earlier this week, we are committed to supporting community organizations like these so they are equipped to take on these fights. 'Meanwhile, we are also reassessing our approach to advocacy, including political giving in Florida and beyond.'",
  "87531f695f8892f0538f8a09f02cbfb4b670e7c8c0a456e25c757ae7": "Vice President Kamala Harris is feeling good and back to sorting through her files at the VP's official residence after testing positive for COVID-19. First gentleman Douglas Emhoff tweeted out a picture of Harris Wednesday night. She can be seen grinning, pen-in-hand, wearing a cream colored blouse inside the residence at the Naval Observatory in Washington.  She is holding a blue ink pen in her right hand.   'Thanks to everyone who sent well wishes for @VP,' wrote Emhoff. 'She is feeling good and is working from home.' The vice president's office has already reported that she is not experiencing symptoms. The White House said Wednesday she was being given Paxlovid - a drug that can reduce severe infections and hospitalizations.  The administration is urging people infected with the virus to reach out to their doctors to see if they are eligible for the drug. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that's what Harris did when questioned about why the VP was getting the drug while not experiencing symptoms.   Psaki fielded another question about the drug Thursday, when asked about the logistical issues. The drug can only be administered within three days of a positive test. Psaki batted down the idea of having people be able to get the drugs in advance. 'It requires a prescription right, but there are a range of ways to have those conversations with your doctor. So I'm not sure it always involves a race to the doctor's office, but different doctors can have virtual appointments and other means of getting prescriptions. It's about consulting to ensure you're eligible,' Psaki said. She also spoke about the White House push for billions in new COVID funds to get the next generation of drugs on the shelf. President Biden didn't take a position when asked Thursday about Senate leaders combing legislation with his request of $33 billion for Ukraine.   'I'm not here to set new deadlines, but I can tell you that both needs are urgent. Well, I would say that need is urgent as is the need for COVID funding is urgent,' Psaki said.  Harris may be finding time during quarantine to catch up on her reading. On the corner of her desk was a copy of Douglas Brinkley's book, American Moonshot. It chronicles the Space Race from early rocketry through the space program in the 1960s. Harris heads the president's space council.  Harris' desk also contains multi-colored sticky notes, two binders, and an iPhone turned upside down. On the wall is a framed newspaper article about her. A box of Kleenex can be seen near her land-line telephone. Her legal pad doesn't have any writing on it. The photo was a demonstration that Harris was still able to fulfill her duties, although she is unable to preside over the Senate during quarantine. (Two Senate Democrats also tested positive, inhibiting the party's ability to take actions).",
  "ee27a4ea2f262a19df43f6f87d84f44f99761b640f4b37552a4e776d": "A top JPMorgan executive has told his staff they can work from home three days a week, after workers at the multinational bank complained the company was tracking their in-office ID swipes in an effort to force them to come back. Drew Cukor, an executive at the bank's artificial intelligence machine and learning and engagement wing, sent out a memo to 'CTO and TRAIN members' on Tuesday. 'The Firm has heard from many around the business...and we're making a few adjustments,' he said, according to a copy of the memo obtained by Insider. 'Effective immediately: We are now authorized to invite our workforce to two days a week in the office.' It is unclear what the team acronyms refer to. JPMorgan Chase did not immediately respond to requests for comment from DailyMail.com. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has been adamant about getting workers back to the office, even as some have talked to the media about their experiences being 'forced' back into the office by supervisors who have had the 'fear of God' put into them. But last month, Dimon conceded that 'working from home will become more permanent in American business,' adding that 40 percent of the company's 270,000 employees could work a few days at their desk. Mayor Eric Adams of New York City, where JPMorgan is based, has urged companies to call their workers back to the office, calling it crucial for the city's 'financial ecosystem.' In the letter dated Tuesday, Cukor said he expected his workers to meet the 'generous modification' requiring them to go into the office two days a week with 'earnestness.' Many employees are reportedly on hybrid rotas where they only go in for three days a week. 'I know many are working effectively from the office, from home and everywhere in between. I'm grateful for everyone's hard work and patience over these last few months.  'Productivity and delivery of effective solutions to our business partners is always top priority alongside the health, safety and happiness of each member of our team,' he wrote. Cukor joined the bank last year after serving in the US Marine Corps for 25 years, serving in multiple roles. He was the head of Project Maven, which focused on developing computer vision algorithms to process drone footage, FedScoop reported. Last week, four sources told Business Insider that JP Morgan workers were having their ID swipes checked to ensure they were going into the office.  One London-based worker said: 'At JPMorgan, nobody trusts you. The higher-ups don't trust you to do your job if they're not constantly watching you in the office.' Another, more senior member, said even managers were not keen and had left them 'deathly afraid' of their teams not having 100 per cent attendance. They said: 'I don't know whether it's because they themselves are too timid or whether it's because the fear of God has been put into them by a bank manager.' They added: 'But every time there's something that requires participation, you sense the panic.' The two sources reportedly said they were looking to leave the company. In a recent letter to shareholders, CEO Dimon said 50 percent of the bank's employees around the world would have to return to the office full time. About 10 percent could work from home forever, he added, while the rest could get by on a hybrid model. Meanwhile Goldman Sachs has also reportedly been looking at ways to coax workers back in the office. Sources told DealBook bosses had talked about the idea for younger bankers at their weekly meetings. They were apparently mulling over scheduling in-office appointments so they had to attend in person. Last month junior Goldman Sachs bankers whose salaries start at $110,000 threatened to quit their jobs after the firm demanded they turn to the office five days a week. 'In Goldman Sachs, the top management says it's employees choice but internally they track which team has most in office attendance,' an employee wrote on the message board Blind, according to New York Post.  'It's f***ing bulls**t from top management saying they are people first,' they added. 'In our team meeting, manager showed us the excel where the MDs [managing directors] are tracking which department has not met in-office commitments.'  Another Goldman Sachs employee wrote on Blind: 'Apparently they are tracking everyone's attendance and managers are getting lists of people who have low attendance so they can bully them into coming in.'  The investment bank demanded employees return to the office five days a week earlier this month, after CEO David Solomon branded working from home an 'aberration'. 'It's an aberration that we're going to correct as quickly as possible,' Solomon said last year. 'The CEO has repeatedly argued that remote work 'is not ideal for us, and it's not a new normal.' Meanwhile this month Goldman Sachs scrapped Covid perks for New York City-based staff including a free car to and from work, as well as free lunches. The upcoming policy changes, made by CEO David Solomon, comes after the Wall Street giant put an end to two years of free lunches and breakfast at the office. Both were designed to incentivize workers to come work in-person amid COVID-19 and a surge in crime in New York. New York City Mayor Eric Adams stressed in February the need to get workers back to offices. Adams seemed to allege he was seeing many people going from work-from-home Monday to Friday, to going out on the weekends. 'You can't tell me you're afraid of Covid on a Monday and I see you in the club on Sunday,' Adams joked. The mayor previously told leaders of major companies in the city to prioritize getting workers back in the office to stimulate the city's economy. 'In order for our economic - financial ecosystem, I should say - to function, we have to have human interaction,' Adams said at an economic development event at the Brooklyn Navy Yard in February, according to Insider. 'It can't be done from home. And if we do that, then we're going to greatly impact low wage workers.' He added: 'You can't stay home in your pajamas all day.'",

Luis Medina, 30, was taken into custody around 11:30 a.m. Saturday for allegedly stabbing a 41-year-old woman multiple times during a domestic dispute at 65 East Gun Hill Road as crime continues to surge in the city.  Medina was taken to Bronx Hospital to be treated for minor injuries and handcuffed to a hospital bed.  While the suspect was being treated by a nurse, 26, he began acting erratically and grabbed a pair of scissors from her hand and hit her in the head with them, NYPD said. The 26-year-old nurse was not seriously injured and fled the room to get help. Medina is then seen on video jumping out of the hospital bed with his wrist still handcuffed to the bed as he attempts to slash at the cop.  When he slips and falls, one of the cops uses a Taser on Medina before fleeing the room for backup.  Medina faces multiple assault charges and criminal possession of a weapon, according to the NYPD. The woman who was stabbed in the Bronx was was taken to Saint Barnabas Hospital, where she was in serious but stable condition, NYPD said.",
  "197c56e868c3a0562dbbba840db00100cc66287c510549ce45e78108": "The WhatsApp message sent by a senior Labour press officer could hardly have been clearer. Asked by the Daily Mail if the party's deputy leader Angela Rayner had been present at the Durham Miners Hall the evening Sir Keir Starmer enjoyed a beer with local MP Mary Foy and other comrades, the spokesman replied categorically: 'Angela wasn't there.' But now that simple claim has been undermined, ironically by Labour's own digital campaigning prowess. Last night, in an astonishing volte-face, Labour belatedly admitted that Mrs Rayner had been there, but gave no further details. The party's about-turn came after a Mail investigation had already established that despite the denials, the party's deputy leader had been in the Miners Hall. Almost a year since the fateful event, when lockdown laws at the time banned indoor socialising except within a household or support bubble, the party's Facebook page still shows a video that proves Sir Keir and Mrs Rayner were in the same building at the same time. It can be revealed today that less than an hour before the infamous video was taken of Sir Keir with bottle in hand, he and his deputy sat at the same desk to address Labour activists across the country. They were the star turns in a live online rally being held less than a week before the country went to the ballot boxes in the pair's first major electoral test. It was advertised by frontbencher Nick Thomas-Symonds in a social media post that can still be viewed today. 'Tune in 8.30pm-9pm tonight for Labour's Get Out The Vote '6 Days to 6th May' rally with Keir Starmer, Angela Rayner and special guests,' he wrote on Twitter on the afternoon of Friday, April 30. He helpfully included a link to the Facebook page hosting the virtual campaigning event, which not only remains online but includes a complete video of the 48-minute proceedings. It was hosted by Labour MP Carolyn Harris, broadcasting from her home in Wales. She made it clear the rally was live by announcing: 'Well, hello everyone and welcome to the very last Friday before May 6.' After her introduction she handed over to Sir Keir, who was wearing the same open-necked white shirt which would later be seen in the clip filmed by passers-by as he drank a bottle of beer. As he addressed voters by webcam, he was sitting in a small room with white walls and a mirror on a mantelpiece that showed the reflection of a distinctive 'half round' fanlight window. Sir Keir gave a six-minute speech to the 16,000 watching online, saying: 'Let me just start by thanking every single person who's on this call this evening. Thank you for joining us.' He said the party was facing 'huge, huge elections', the first since the 'devastating' national poll in December 2019 - which saw Boris Johnson rout his predecessor as Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. Sir Keir claimed the upcoming elections would pit his Labour Party against a 'Conservative Party that's up to its neck in sleaze'. After the rally heard from other speakers, including one in the US, host Miss Harris handed over to the final speaker - Angela Rayner. She appeared on screen in front of the same background Sir Keir had sat in front of less than 20 minutes earlier - the same white walls, the same mirror on the mantelpiece and the same window in the reflection. And she even confirmed exactly where she was, quoting the motto of Durham Miners. 'Being here at the Miners Hall in Durham, I've got to start with 'the past we inherit, the future we build',' Mrs Rayner said. As well as hosting the 'Pitman's Parliament' in decades gone by and being the headquarters of the Durham Miners' Association, the grand Edwardian building is also used for constituency meetings by Mrs Foy. And it is where the party has admitted Sir Keir was when he was caught enjoying a drink with colleagues, including Mrs Foy, in an apparent breach of Covid rules at the time as well as government electioneering guidance that stated: 'You should not meet with other campaigners indoors.' That video was shot a little after 10pm - less than an hour after Mrs Rayner addressed the online rally from a room there. Photos of the hall show that its ground floor has the same distinctive fanlight windows that can be seen in the background of Sir Keir and Mrs Rayner's pieces to camera. The full 43-second clip of the video revealed by the Mail this week shows Sir Keir in another room of the hall, swigging from a bottle of beer and listening to Mrs Foy while two men eat food by the doorway. A woman sitting facing the two Labour MPs had been named by social media users as Joy Allen, then campaigning to be Durham crime tsar. But she has denied being present and the evidence obtained by the Mail suggests the woman is Mrs Rayner. When this newspaper first asked the party's press office in January about Mrs Rayner's possible presence, the reply was unequivocal: 'Angela wasn't there.' But the deputy leader had also shared photos and videos of herself with Sir Keir in the building at the same time. She was wearing the same polka-dot dress as she wore during the online rally and earlier that day while out canvassing hundreds of miles away in Birmingham. The next day - at 8.53am on Saturday, May 1 - she posted two photographs of herself in front of miners' lodges banners at the hall and wrote: 'Last year was the first year in two decades that I couldn't come to Durham. It's good to be back!' Then at 9.45am she shared a video - which again is still online - of herself and Sir Keir touring the building which Labour claims she had not stepped inside. It began with him declaring: 'On International Workers' Day, we're at Redhills, the historic Durham Miners Hall.' Mrs Rayner was filmed outside the building saying: 'From here in Durham to the miners in South Wales, it was working people and trade unionists who created local healthcare systems that laid the foundations for our country's greatest institution, the National Health Service.' The morning after the indoor event, Sir Keir and Mrs Rayner were pictured in hard hats and hi-vis jackets as they visited a major building development in Durham, known as Milburngate.",
  "470a107d11e0bf268738cd82f9111b092716d57b272d3fae53ba8d5b": "Tens of thousands of Australians will become reinfected with Covid-19 as new sub-variants of Omicron emerge ahead of winter, experts have warned. NSW recorded its first case of the BA.4 strain on Thursday with the BA.5 sub-variant also expected to reach the country within the next couple of months.  Both strains are variants of Omicron and have led to a sharp uptick in Covid-19 cases in South Africa.  University of Melbourne epidemiologist James McCaw warned the rise of new variants meant people who had been struck down with Covid-19 could be reinfected. 'We will get reinfected, and we are most likely to be reinfected by new versions of the virus which are immunologically different,' he told Sydney Morning Herald.  'It's going to happen more and more because it's the only way for the virus to establish itself. It will be around forever because of reinfections.'  UNSW's School of Public Health and Community Medicine James Wood said transmissions would spike across the country within the next couple of months. 'BA.4 and BA.5 in South Africa are clearly causing cases to go up, and we can expect these are already here in low numbers,' he said.  Some states have already published reinfection rates with thousands of residents already struck down with the virus twice. Victoria has reported 10,000 reinfections between December and March. The Northern Territory recorded 28. NSW has yet to publish its data while Western Australia and Queensland does not keep track of it. Professor Wood said unvaccinated residents were the most likely to be reinfected. Children aged under 12 would be particularly vulnerable with low vaccination rates among the group. Only 39.5 per cent of children aged between five to 11 have received two doses of the vaccine while 52.8 per cent have received their first dose. The warning comes as states phase out isolation rules for close contacts.  NSW, Victoria and the ACT have already ditched the requirement and Queensland followed suit at 6pm on Thursday. Western Australia became the second-last state or territory to abolish quarantine for asymptomatic COVID-19 close contacts, in line with national guidelines, at 12.01am on Friday. South Australia will from Saturday drop the need to isolate unless showing symptoms. Fully vaccinated close contacts in the NT no longer need to isolate unless they are symptomatic. Tasmania will drop the seven-day isolation requirement for close contacts of Covid-19 cases from May 2.",
  "afeb4965d7a8ce8e50d2fbf832824992d4bf1a9de39e4a6f5f375ff7": "Elon Musk called on Thursday the creation of Joe Biden's new 'disinformation' board 'discomforting' as the president tapped a Russia misinformation 'expert' to lead the initiative. The billionaire, who just acquired Twitter this week, was responding to a tweet from conservative political commentator, comedian and media personality Steven Crowder. 'The government is creating a misinformation governance board,' Crowder tweeted on Thursday. 'Who else did something like that?' he continued. 'Oh I remember, the Nazi's. And there's some data showing some interesting things going on post- @elonmusk's Twitter takeover!' Nina Jankowicz was brought on to lead the Department of Homeland Security's Disinformation Governance Board to combat disinformation related to national security - and she expressed concerns last week that Musk expanding free speech on social media would be bad for 'marginalized communities'. On Wednesday, Jankowicz defended her previous remarks casting doubt on the validity of the Hunter Biden laptop scandal. Republican Senator Josh Hawley is demanding that the White House 'dissolve' the new Department of Homeland Security's Disinformation Governance Board she is heading, claiming that it would only 'monitor Amerians' free speech'. A tweet Jankowicz sent in October 2020 has resurfaced and is making the rounds in conservative circles. 'Back on the 'laptop from hell,' apparently- Biden notes 50 former natsec officials and 5 former CIA heads that believe the laptop is a Russian influence op,' she tweeted at the time. She added: 'Trump says 'Russia, Russia, Russia.' She now claims that the tweet was part of her 'live tweeting' a debate between Trump and Biden just one month before the presidential general election as Republicans are using the post to pounce on her political leanings. 'For those who believe this tweet is a key to all my views, it is simply a direct quote from both candidates during the final presidential debate,' Jankowicz defended in a repost of the original tweet. 'If you look at my timeline, you will see I was livetweeting that evening,' she added in the Wednesday night tweet. Jankowicz confirmed reports on Wednesday that she is being brought on as executive director of the new board at DHS. Republicans immediately blasted the move, claiming she has shown too much bias to head the group - specifically in casting doubt on Hunter's laptop scandal. In October 2020, Jankowicz called the laptop stories a 'Trump campaign product.' Senator Hawley insisted on Thursday that the board should be dissolved before it even gets started. 'I write with deep concern about the Department of Homeland Security's decision to create a new Disinformation Governance Board,' he penned in a letter to DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. 'I confess I at first thought this announcement was satire,' he continued. 'Surely no American Administration would ever use the power of Government to sit in judgment on the First Amendment speech of its own citizens.' 'Sadly, I was mistaken.' He then demanded that DHS provide more information on this new board, including how it will function and be monitored. Hawley also questioned why the announcement was made just following billionaire Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter, which he vowed to make a more free speech platform with all ideas. Jankowicz was critical of Musk buying Twitter, claiming that more free speech on the social media platform was a negative thing. Wisconsin Republican Senator Ron Johnson sent a statement against the formation of the board. 'The Biden Administration has not proven itself to be a credible arbiter of 'disinformation.' Instead, it has taken steps to silence information that is unflattering to this Administration under the guise of 'disinformation,' Johnson wrote. 'For example, unnamed intelligence officials, the media, and social media platforms engaged in a coordinated effort to censor stories about Hunter Biden's laptop and his questionable financial dealings under the false label of 'disinformation.' 'I am concerned DHS's Disinformation Board will only serve to silence or censor those voices critical of your disastrous policies and serve a political cover for your failure to secure the border,' the senator concluded. Mayorkas did not disclose any powers that would be granted to the dystopian-sounding board while addressing lawmakers on Wednesday. He explained that the board would work to tackle disinformation ahead of the November midterms, particularly in Hispanic communities. He also said that the board would come under the Biden-era Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships (CP3), meaning it would have no powers to crack down on disinformation and will instead try to combat it by throwing money at what it sees as problems. The CP3 program provides communities with resources and tools to help prevent individuals from radicalizing to violence. Last year, CP3 awarded about $20 million in grants through its Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention Grant Program. It is unclear how much cash will be spent on the Disinformation Board. Mayorkas noted that the focus of the new board would be to stop the spread of misinformation in minority communities, including election misinformation ahead of the 2022 midterms.  He added that it would focus on the latest trend of misinformation allegedly targeting Spanish-speaking voters. No further details on the exact misinformation being deployed against these communities was shared.  Jankowicz, who revealed she was the head of the department following Mayorkas' meeting with lawmakers, tweeted: 'Cat's out of the bag: here's what I've been up to the past two months, and why I've been a bit quiet on here.  Nina Jankowicz had already made a name for herself before being appointed head of Biden's Russian disinformation unit. Jankowicz, 33, is a successful author who is currently eight months pregnant with her first child. She grew up in New Jersey and is dating Michael Stein. The couple are happily shacked up in a $1 million, three-bedroom, two-and-a-half bathroom property they own in Arlington, Virginia. Jankowicz, attended Bryn Mawr College and Georgetown University, before embarking on a glittering career in foreign relations. She managed programs to Russia and Belarus at the National Democratic Institute. Jankowicz also advised the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry on disinformation and strategic communications She serves on the Board of Trustees for the Eurasia Foundation and is a global fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center But the author is best known as a prominent woke voice online.   The Biden appointee's latest book, How To Be A Woman Online has just been released, and deals with the topics of internet bullying and trolling. She has complained about hordes of men tracking down her private Facebook and Instagram accounts after she appears on TV to try to follow her and find out more about her life. Jankowicz says she prefers strangers to follow her Twitter account, and speculates that many of those who criticize her online are jealous of her 'verified' blue check mark and media career.  She has identified five different types of trolls who target her most, including 'reply guy' types who insist on trying to meddle in all aspects of her life, including in how brown she toasts her bread.  Despite claiming to be a free speech campaigner online, Jankowicz has spoken out against the First Amendment.  Aligning herself with many online progressives who've begun to call for an end to unqualified free speech, Jankowicz recently tweeted: 'I shudder to think about if free speech absolutists were taking over more platforms, what that would look like for the marginalized communities...which are already shouldering...disproportionate amounts of this abuse.' She also said the prospect of Elon Musk taking over Twitter made her 'shudder.' But Jankowicz - who has a pet dog and a cat - has not joined thousands of other liberals who've vowed to quit the platform as a result of Musk's purchase.   'Honored to be serving in the Biden Administration @DHSgov and helping shape our counter-disinformation efforts.' She added that 'a HUGE focus of our work, and indeed, one of the key reasons the Board was established, is to maintain the Dept's committment (sic) to protecting free speech, privacy, civil rights, & civil liberties.' The Russia disinformation expert previously called the laptop of President Joe Biden's son Hunter a 'Trump campaign product'. This is causing questions over Jankowicz's ability to accurately judge disinformation now that several sources have come out confirming the validity of Hunter's laptop. Jankowicz also suggested last week that she opposes the The First Amendment because she thinks it is bad for 'marginalized communities' and called Elon Musk a 'free speech absolutist' because he wants to make Twitter more open to all voices.  The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to DailyMail.com's request for comment.  Jankowicz is a fellow at the Wilson Center where she studies the 'intersection of democracy and technology in Central and Eastern Europe'. She is also the author of How To Lose the Information War: Russia, Fake News, and the Future of Conflict.  When stories about Hunter Biden's laptop started emerging, several outlets, social media sites and left-leaning disinformation experts claimed that it was just misinformation coming from Trump and others on the right. In an October 2020 report, Jankowicz shared her skepticism of the contents of the laptop and the claims it belonged to Hunter. 'We should view it as a Trump campaign product,' she told the New York Daily News at the time. Twitter repeatedly took down the Hunter Biden laptop story and prevented it from being spread on the platform. Billionaire Elon Musk, who just purchased Twitter, said that his aim is to make the social media platform a more open 'digital town square.' 'Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,' Musk wrote in a statement upon the purchase approval. Jankowicz spoke with NPR last week and questioned Musk's purchase of the platform and 'I shudder to think about if free speech absolutists were taking over more platforms, what that would look like for the marginalized communities,' she said. She said these groups are 'already shouldering...disproportionate amounts of this abuse' and said free speech and lack of censoring on social media would make it worse. Missouri Republican Senator Josh Hawley tweeted an image of her remarks to NPR with the caption: 'The Biden Administration's new anti-speech czar is apparently no fan of the  @elonmusk Twitter acquisition.' 'This is the person Joe Biden just put in charge of policing Americans' speech. Using the power of the government.' Jankowicz has advised the Ukrainian government on strategist communications - she also managed democracy assistance programs to Russia and Belarus. She received her masters in Russian, Eurasian, and East European Studies from Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, and her bachelors degree from Bryn Mawr College.",
  "0ca728b7d351c35e00bedae3f13f78a96e5f33b4b7d79779c0fbf374": "Ukraine has released a video which purports to show the grim aftermath of Russian bombardment of a military field hospital where hundreds were sheltering within in Mariupol. The images, released by the far-right Azov Brigade, are reported to be from within the Azovstal steelworks.  It is the last Ukrainian holdout in the strategic port city which has been under siege for almost two months. As many as 600 people are thought to be holed up in the hospital, many of those being treated for war wounds, plus 50 children and elderly.  Major Serhiy Volyna, commander of the 36th Brigade of the Ukrainian Army, told Sky News there had been a direct hit on the shelter of the military hospital, describing the situation as 'difficult'. This latest attack is despite Vladimir Putin calling off the offensive and ordering all routes out of the site of the Azovstal steelworks to be sealed off. Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor, said on Friday 'every day they drop several bombs on Azovstal, despite false promises not to touch the defenders', adding that 'fighting, shelling, bombing do not stop'. Defiant Ukrainian soldiers holed up in the steelworks are still refusing to surrender Mariupol despite being surrounded by Russian forces as the bodies of dead civilians continue to pile up. In the video, which has not been independently verified, a rescue worker wearing a red head light can be seen digging away at rubble with a shovel. In another shot, a survivor is holding a bottle of water with a tremendously shaking hand. In a wider shot, rescue workers attend to the survivors in a dark and smoky scene reminiscent of a natural disaster or terror attack. Azov is a far-right all-volunteer infantry military unit whose members - estimated at 900 - are ultra-nationalists and accused of harbouring neo-Nazi and white supremacist ideology.  The Azov brigade is an all-volunteer far-right military unit of the National Guard of Ukraine, based in Mariupol, holding around 900 members. Formed in May 2014, the ultra-nationalists have been fighting Russian forces since the annexation of Crimea in the same year. In 2015, a spokesman for the Azov Brigade, Andriy Diachenko, said that up to 20 per cent of the group's members are Nazis, he told USA today. Russia used the Brigade's official status with the National Guard as evidence that their invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 was to 'denazify' what they described as a nazi-leaning Ukranian government. The Azovstal steelworks, a huge and sprawling facility that makes up almost 20 per cent of Mariupol, has been home to the last remaining Ukrainians in the city. The rest of the city has been effectively razed to the ground by Russian forces. Vladimir Putin gave the word to trap the survivors inside the steelworks and starve them out if they did not surrender.  Efforts to evacuate those remaining from the city along humanitarian corridors have reportedly been blocked by the Russians. This comes after local officials said there were mass graves in the besieged city of Mariupol, containing around 9,000 bodies of Ukranian civillians.  Mariupol's mayor Vadym Boychenko accused the Russians of 'hiding their military crimes' by taking the bodies of civilians from the city and burying them in Manhush. Boychenko labelled Russian actions in the city as 'the new Babi Yar', a reference to the site of multiple Nazi massacres in which nearly 34,000 Ukrainian Jews were killed in 1941. 'The bodies of the dead were being brought by the truckload and actually simply being dumped in mounds,' adviser Andryushchenko said.",
  "189a615067357e6a56a1bc6b57a3f915f1dd40a377f5c16e3ac6a5dd": "The Florida Department of Education has reinstated nine previously nixed math textbooks that were banned because of references to Critical Race Theory and social justice issues after publishers scrubbed them of the problematic 'woke' content.      'Publishers are aligning their instructional materials to state standards and removing 'woke' content' - a statement posted to the department's website Thursday revealed. Those revisions, officials said, addressed content - such as bar graphs measuring racial prejudice and a portion titled 'What? Me? Racist?' - the state previously deemed to be 'not aligned with Florida standards, or which 'included prohibited topics and unsolicited strategies.' The nine textbooks were revised and added to the state adoption list over the past 11 days, officials said. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis had banned CRT as a component in Florida schools, claiming it promotes hatred among students and makes individuals feel guilty for racism of the past.  'It seems that some publishers attempted to slap a coat of paint on an old house built on the foundation of Common Core, and indoctrinating concepts like race essentialism, especially, bizarrely, for elementary school students,' he said of the rejected books.  'I'm grateful that Commissioner [of Education Richard] Corcoran and his team at the Department have conducted such a thorough vetting of these textbooks to ensure they comply with the law.'  Earlier this month, the state DOE garnered criticism for tossing out 41 percent of math textbooks presented for use in schools next year, without detailing the contentious content. The public outcry spurred officials to release some of the problematic pages last week - pages that were again featured in the Florida DOE's statement Thursday. Of the lessons deemed unacceptable by the state was one that used bar graphs to measure levels of racial prejudice based on age and political identity. The lesson asks students to solve equations based on the findings. The graphs, which used data from the Project Implicit Discrimination website, show attempt to illustrate that those 65 and older who lean towards conservative political beliefs have the most racial bias. Another example of banned material includes a lesson plan for polynomials, with one of the problems once again referencing the Implicit Association Test, claiming that the 2 million people who have taken the test have 'slight' or 'moderate' bias, which changes based on age and political identification.  Florida has banned 54 of the 132 math textbooks submitted to the state, a total of 41 percent.  Of the rejected books:   In Grades K-5, 71 percent of materials were rejected.  Grades 6-8 saw 20 percent of materials rejected, and in grades 9-12, 35 percent of materials were rejected.  The last two examples released by the state both mention SEL, which is banned in Florida, with one listing an SEL objective in math that states: 'Students build proficiency with social awareness as they practice with empathizing with classmates.'  The other, which was posted with a redacted line, calls for a lesson plan 'to build student agency by focusing on students' social and emotional learning, specifically the five competencies that make up the framework,' which include self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills and responsible decision-making.     The DOE said the examples provided do not represent an exhaustive list of the type of material banned and that the rejected publishers will be able to appeal the state's decision and are granted the right to alter the submitted textbooks as long as it meets that state's specifications. The department said in a statement last week that the 54 books were banned because they were not 'aligned with Florida standards or included prohibited topics and unsolicited strategies.'  'Reasons for rejecting textbooks included references to Critical Race Theory (CRT), inclusions of Common Core, and the unsolicited addition of Social Emotional Learning (SEL) in mathematics,' the department added, noting that all three learning practices are banned in the state.  'The highest number of books rejected were for grade levels K-5, where an alarming 71 percent were not appropriately aligned with Florida standards or included prohibited topics and unsolicited strategies. 'The Department is continuing to give publishers the opportunity to remediate all deficiencies identified during the review to ensure the broadest selection of high quality instructional materials are available to the school districts and Florida's students,' the DOE said after issuing the book rejections.'  By Alex Oliveira  A Tennessee state lawmaker declared that he would burn banned books if given his way during a Tennessee General Assembly session Wednesday. State Rep. Jerry Sexton, a Republican from eastern Tennessee, made the comments during a discussion about legislation he proposed that would give a commission of politicians the power to veto books out of school libraries.  Rep. John Ray Clemmons, a Democrat from Nashville, asked Sexton what he would do with the removed books. 'You going to put them in the street? Light them on fire? Where are they going?' he asked. 'I don't have a clue, but I would burn 'em,' Sexton responded on the House floor. 'That's what I thought.' Clemmons concluded.  The Republican-supermajority House approved the bill in a 66-26 vote.  Sexton's legislation and comments come after a national debate around banned books was sparked when a Tennessee school board removed the book Maus - a Pulitzer Prize winning graphic novel by Art Spiegelman, who is Jewish, that paints an unfiltered picture of the Holocaust - from its district's curriculum in January.  In Nazi Germany books by Jewish authors and books with content decreed disagreeable were publicly burned by the tens of thousands.  Earlier this year, Sexton lashed out at librarians during a legislative hearing that included testimony from some who alleged without proof that educators were attempting to 'groom' children with sexually explicit materials found in libraries. 'I don't appreciate what's going in our libraries, what's being put in front of our children and shame on you for putting it there,' Sexton said at the time.  Democratic Rep. Gloria Johnson, from Knoxville, said the legislation aimed at libraries was taking 'Tennessee in a dangerous direction.' Certain books have long faced removal from American schools for profane language, sexually explicit content, and even for mere negativity, but the past few years have seen an increase in complaints and actions against books, largely in conservative-dominated states. Conservative lawmakers have begun challenging some books on the grounds that they are being used to brainwash America's youth about race and gender. During a Wednesday event at the White House to honor teachers, President Biden weighed in on the subject.   'There are too many politicians trying to score political points trying to ban books, even math books,' he said, referring to the recent ban of a number of math textbooks in Florida, 'Did you ever think when you'd be teaching you're gonna be worried about book burnings and banning books all because it doesn't fit somebody's political agenda?' A recent report from PEN America, a non-profit dedicated to promoting free expression through literature, found that there are currently 1,586 instances of books being banned or restricted in the United States.  Those bans are in 86 school districts across 26 states. Texas has the most books banned at 713. Pennsylvania has 456, Florida has 204, Oklahoma has 43, Kansas has 30, and Tennessee has 16, according to that report. ",
  "ee757eb597383e3c66adfcdf62c0d354ab6183ce090177e31358c908": "A former Boston police union chief wept in court Monday as child rape victims tore into him after the disgraced cop admitted to raping and sexually abusing several children over the span of nearly three decades.  Ex-Police Patrolmen's Association boss Patrick Rose, 67, pleaded guilty to 21 counts of child rape and sexual assault that occurred over a 27-year period, involving victims ranging in age from 7 to 16, prosecutors said.   The former cop sat in court and cried as he listened to some of his victims deliver impact statements before he was sentenced to up to 13 years in prison.  'I saw you for what you really are -- a coward, a predator of the weak and the defenseless,' the victim said in court. Another victim said Rose has lost his reputation as a protector. 'Your reputation? Absolutely gone,' the victim said. ''All you will ever be remembered as is another creep who has nothing going for him. Your job as a cop protecting people? [Well] that's really quite ironic isn't it?'  Rose had first faced child sexual abuse allegations in the mid-1990s, but criminal charges were dropped.  However, Rose was allowed to remain on the force for years despite sufficient evidence found by internal investigators supporting allegations that he sexually assaulted a minor, according to documents released by the city last year. Rose had been relieved of his weapon and placed on administrative duty, but was returned to full duty after an attorney for the Boston Police Patrolmen's Association wrote to the commissioner in 1997 and threatened to file a grievance, according to the documents, obtained by NBC Boston.  He was then elected president of the Boston Police Patrolman's Association in 2014 and served until he retired in 2018. Rose was charged in August 2020 with sexually abusing a 7-year-old female relative, who, now a teenager, had told police the abuse continued for five years until she turned 12.  The victim told police that Rose allegedly touched her inappropriately and asked her to perform sexual acts on him in his West Roxbury home. Several more people then came forward alleging they were abused by Rose.  He was ultimately charged with 33 counts of sexual abuse of six children.  On Monday, Rose pleaded guilty to the multitude of sexual abuse crimes spanning nearly three decades.   Rose had previously denied the charges but reached a plea deal with prosecutors. Documents released last year of a 1996 internal police department probe showed that top officials concluded Rose likely sexually abused a child yet he continued to patrol in Dorchester and interact with children and sex-abuse victims, masslive.com reported.  Then-Police Commissioner Paul Evans and internal investigations chief Ann Marie Doherty released a joint statement in April 2021 defending their actions, saying that they were unable to discipline Rose because they did not have a witness or other evidence, the Globe reported.  'We believed at the time, and we still believe, that everything that could be done by the Boston Police Department was done in this matter to hold Rose accountable,' the statement read. On Monday, Suffolk District Attorney Kevin Hayden praised the courage of the victims and said he hoped the plea brings a measure of healing. 'Anyone who was in that courtroom today knows the tremendous courage, fortitude and bravery that they withstood throughout this entire horrible incident. These are monstrous, monstrous acts,' he said outside of court. Following the impact statements, Rose expressed remorse in a statement he read in court. 'I want to apologize for my despicable behavior,' he said. 'I apologize to my former colleagues. I apologize to my former friends, but more importantly, the more important thing in my life, I apologize to my family. To those I hurt, I'm so very sorry.'",
  "a02751887da32fa87cb36e88f6fa8fb165b1748a9b2dd248acead2a1": "Sir Keir Starmer was last night accused of hypocrisy for attending a birthday cake celebration in his office during the pandemic. The Labour leader tucked into the shop-bought chocolate and lemon cakes while coronavirus guidance advised against holding close social gatherings indoors. Sir Keir has repeatedly demanded Boris Johnson quit for attending an impromptu birthday gathering in the Cabinet Room in June 2020 - just three months before his own celebration. The PM and Chancellor were hit with fines for breaking lockdown laws that banned indoor gatherings at that time. However, it has now emerged that Sir Keir was given a birthday card and two cakes in his office on his birthday in September 2020. While Covid laws on gatherings had been relaxed a month earlier, government guidance at the time stated that people should not 'hold or attend celebrations (such as parties) where it is difficult to maintain social distancing and avoid close social interaction'. The Government also said people should not 'socialise indoors in groups of more than two households'. It was not clear last night how many others helped Sir Keir to eat the cakes in his office.  A Tory source said: 'It now seems that, as well as sinking a few cold ones with mates at his infamous Durham drinks party, Sir Keir flouted the guidance in place for a little birthday bash... that is of course unless you believe that he popped out to a shop, bought himself a cake and sat alone eating it in his office. 'We know that Labour have lied about these things in the past so it makes you wonder what else they're hiding. The stench of hypocrisy gets stronger by the day.' Sir Keir claimed the Prime Minister and Chancellor 'dishonoured their office' by attending the impromptu birthday celebration on June 19, 2020, the day Mr Johnson turned 56. Rishi Sunak was in attendance because he had been invited to a crucial meeting about Covid. Mr Johnson was eating a salad. It was initially believed that the PM had been presented with a Union Jack cake while aides sang 'Happy Birthday' to him.  However, it has since emerged that the cake - bought by a special adviser - never even left its Tupperware box. Some sausage rolls from Marks and Spencer were laid out on the Cabinet table along with a few cans of Estrella lager, but it is believed that these too were left untouched.  Nevertheless, Sir Keir claimed Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak's attendance had 'dishonoured' the sacrifices made by people during lockdown - as well as their offices.  After the men were fined, Sir Keir said: 'This is the first time in the history of our country that a Prime Minister has been found to be in breach of the law, and then he lied repeatedly to the public about it. Britain deserves better, they [the PM and the Chancellor] have to go.'  Labour did not respond to a request for comment last night. However, a party source said no laws were broken. 'This is the first time in the history of our country that a Prime Minister has been found to be in breach of the law, and then he lied repeatedly to the public about it. Britain deserves better, they have to go.' Sir Keir Starmer, April 12 'Now we know the Prime Minister did not shut down his own birthday party... he spent it breaking the law. We have a Prime Minister who is sorry only that he has been found out.' Angela Rayner, April 21 'We are all concerned by the situation in Ukraine, but that should not be used as a smokescreen for the failings of this Prime Minister.' MP Matt Western, April 21  ",
  "49cdd53006ca817ceee761aa46c9547ce7da3234c7a2f4265227818f": "Angela Rayner last night risked accusations of a cover-up over the sexism row that has convulsed Westminster. Labour's deputy leader had described a story in last week's Mail on Sunday - which said she had joked with Tory MPs about crossing and uncrossing her legs to distract Boris Johnson - as 'disgusting' and 'completely untrue'. Amid a storm of criticism on social media, Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle demanded a meeting with the newspaper's editor David Dillon. Mr Dillon rejected the call, saying that journalists should 'not take instruction' from parliamentary officials. Yesterday The Daily Telegraph reported that two Conservative MPs had told the newspaper they had heard Mrs Rayner laughing publicly about the idea that she could put off the Prime Minister by 'giving him a flash'. The witnesses said she had been joking about the suggestion that she was crossing and uncrossing her legs during a light-hearted discussion on the Commons terrace about two months ago. Separately, The Mail On Sunday has now spoken to a total of four Tory MPs - the original source and three others, including one woman - all of whom supported this account and contradicted the insinuation by Mrs Rayner and her allies that the claims were cooked up by sexists. One of the MPs, describing a night on the Commons terrace earlier this year, said Mrs Rayner had initiated the discussion of the issue. They said she had spoken of giving the Prime Minister 'a flash'. A second MP claimed that Mrs Rayner had referenced the thriller Basic Instinct, in which Sharon Stone's character infamously uncrosses her legs while being interrogated by police. 'Angela told us: 'I like to do my Sharon Stone trick to distract Boris... I cross and uncross my legs',' the witness said. A third MP added that they also remembered the encounter. The original source for the Mail on Sunday story said that the 'Sharon Stone' joke had been made while Mrs Rayner spoke to a Tory MP. 'She was telling him how she distracts Boris,' they said. All four Tories gave almost identical accounts of her remarks. They each said Mrs Rayner had used a startling slang colloquialism during the discussion. When The Mail on Sunday approached Mrs Rayner last Saturday about the exchanges on the terrace, a Labour spokesman said: 'It's completely made up, so unless they're going to say something properly on the record or have any evidence I would expect that this made-up story wouldn't run. 'I'm telling you categorically it's untrue so I'm afraid you know that doesn't meet the bar, an unnamed source without any evidence... I'm telling you, it's categorically untrue that this has happened.' After Mrs Rayner strenuously denied making the remarks, coverage of the story initially concentrated on allegations of sexism. The row then saw Sir Lindsay attempt to summon The Mail on Sunday's editor for a meeting. However, on Wednesday the Daily Mail revealed that Mrs Rayner had in fact publicly joked about the Basic Instinct comparison herself in January. Speaking to Matt Forde for his Political Party podcast, she volunteered the fact that her appearances in the Commons had prompted online references to the 1992 movie thriller. 'Every time I do a Prime Minister's Questions somebody has an opinion on what I wear. Did you see the meme about Sharon Stone like I was doing it at PMQs? I was mortified,' she said, laughing. 'I wasn't aware I did it but apparently there was this whole meme about how my dress was a bit revealing. I didn't think it was. It was a perfectly suitable Karen Millen - in the sale by the way.' The podcast also saw her use the same slang colloquialism MPs say she used on the Commons terrace. Meanwhile, as the backlash grew over Sir Lindsay's intervention, Mr Dillon formally turned down the Speaker's request for a meeting, saying that Britain's free Press would not endure if journalists had to take instructions from officials in the House of Commons. He also said other MPs had come forward to corroborate the original account of Mrs Rayner's remarks. The Prime Minister later backed Mr Dillon's decision. A No 10 spokesman said Mr Johnson would not want 'any perception of politicians seeking to in any way curb or control what a free Press seeks to report'. A spokesman for Mrs Rayner last night declined to comment further on the story.",
  "95a54125d199ed04fd87bcb5f9df976691b9eee6b49261d45489dd14": "The well-respected parents of a woman who suffered from Locked-in Syndrome and was found dead fused to a living room couch, covered in insects and her own bodily fluids are facing second-degree murder charges.  Shelia, 64, and Clay Fletcher, 65, will face a grand jury Monday after their 36-year-old daughter Lacey Ellen was found partially naked, sitting upright and submerged in a hole in a couch covered from head to toe in urine, liquid feces and insect bites, with live bugs and rodent excrement nearby at their otherwise tidy home in Slaughter, East Feliciana Parish Coroner Dr. Ewell Dewitt Bickham III told the DailyMail.com on Thursday.  'The scene was sickening. I've seen some horrible things in my life but nothing like this,' said Bickham, a medical worker since the 1970s, adding that she had bed sores that went all the way down to her bone. Lacey suffered from locked-in syndrome, a rare neurological disorder characterized by complete paralysis of voluntary muscles, except for those that control the eyes. Police arrived at the ranch-style home in the suburb north of Baton Rouge on January 3 to find the ghastly scene after the parents called 911 because Lacey wasn't breathing, prosecutors said. The parents were supposed to be the girl's care providers, but Bickham said she had not been to a physician in 20 years.  'It's unconscionable, something you make horror movies about,' he said.  WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGE    When he arrived at the home, he described the stench being so bad that, 'it would almost run you out of the house.'  He told the DailyMail.com that he knew it was a 'potential crime scene,' and immediately called his detective. 'The parents were in the kitchen. They did not have an explanation,' he said. He ruled her death a homicide and cause of death as medical neglect. He recorded the official time of death as 3:07 am on January 3, 2022 but said he believes she was deceased at least 24-48 hours prior.  Sheila Fletcher has worked as a police and court clerk in Baker and more recently as an assistant to the city prosecutor in Zachary, report said. According to her LinkedIn page, Sheila was a Slaughter official who  resigned her post on the town's Board of Aldermen on January 24, three weeks after her daughter's death. She served for four years, most recently as mayor pro team. State business filings show Clay Fletcher is an officer of the nonprofit Baton Rouge Civil War Roundtable, which has a mission 'to educate and foster an appreciation for the sacrifices made by all during the Civil War.'      The couple's lawyer, Steven Moore, was unavailable for comment on Thursday when DailyMail.com contacted him.  However, on Wednesday, Moore issued a statement on his client's behalf, BPProud reported. 'They don't want to relive the pain of losing a child through the media. They have been through a lot of heartache over the years. Anyone who had lost a child knows what it's like,' Moore said.  On Monday, Bickham will  present the case to a grand jury, in the hopes of charging the parents in the death of their daughter. 'I probably won't even have to open my mouth the pictures will show it,' Bickham said. He added: 'The jurors are storekeepers, farmers many have never been exposed to this stuff so I asked that a medical team be outside the courtroom.' District Attorney Sam D'Aquilla told the Dailymail.com that the parents were never  taken into custody because they're not considered flight risks. A 12-person jury will be in a closed session at the court house in Clinton, where they will decide on charges of manslaughter, negligent homicide or second-degree murder, he said. 'Negligent homicide is zero to five years; manslaughter is zero to 40 years and second-degree is life in prison. I will ask for second-degree because they didn't do what they were supposed to do,' he said.     D'Aquilla confirmed to DailyMail.com that Lacey's parents were her primary caretakers, and that she did not have an aide. 'We don't treat animals or neglect our animals in that way. If you have an animal in that condition you take them to the vet,' he said.   Locked-in syndrome (LIS), also known as pseudocoma, is a rare neurological disorder characterized by complete paralysis of voluntary muscles, except for those that control the eyes. People with LIS are conscious and can think and reason, but they are unable to speak or move. The only way they can communicate is through blinking and vertical eye movements. Some of the causes of this disorder may stem from a traumatic brain injury, brain stem stroke, tumors, diseases of the circulatory system (bleeding), diseases that destroy the myelin sheath surrounding nerve cells (like multiple sclerosis), infection, or medication overdose.  There is no cure or specific treatments for locked-in syndrome, according to GARD, Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center. The organization recommends supportive therapy for breathing and feeding, particularly early on. Additional treatment include: physical therapy, comfort care, nutritional support, and prevention of complications from respiratory infections. A person with LIS may have partial muscle control, in some cases. Speech therapists can help people with locked-in syndrome communicate more clearly with eye movements and blinking.  Electronic communication devices, including patient-computer interfaces such as infrared eye movement sensors and computer voice prosthetics, enables people to communicate more freely and have access to the internet. Motorized wheelchairs have also increased their independence.  Those with locked-in syndrome do not live beyond the early stage due to medical complications, GARD said.. However, others may live for another 10-20 years and report a good quality of life despite the severe disabilities caused by the syndrome.   D'Aquilla told the DailyMail.com that Lacey had some issues that she went to see a psychiatrist for back in 1999 or early 2000s and that she had been anti-social.  He said that in 2011-2012, her parents claimed that she did not want to leave the house and had not been to a doctor. He said that Lacey's parents claimed that she was able to communicate with them and that she apparently never complained.   'If you are not capable of providing the care than get help,' he said. 'We want people to know that if you are a caregiver of someone you need to pay attention is it important for neighbors and the community to look out for each other. We hope this never happens again.'   According to a 2020 U.S. census, 882 people live in Slaughter, a town in East Feliciana Parish. Many of the homes are spread out over acres, so when news of Lacey's death broke many in the community were stunned with some having no idea that Clay and Shelia Fletcher even had a daughter.  'They are appalled,' said the coroner who spoke to some of the neighbors. 'Some of these people were churchgoing friends who had no idea that there was another person in that house.   ",
  "468d60e120fd79211a6d80434e477f7bea940a6d94326ce046ea6ca6": "Twitter's top lawyer Vijaya Gadde is in the spotlight after Elon Musk criticized her in a string of scathing tweets, leading a former company executive to accuse the billionaire of 'bullying' and spearheading a harassment campaign. Gadde, 47, has been a low-key Silicon Valley power player for years, and at Twitter played a key role in the contentious decisions to ban Donald Trump and suppress news articles about Hunter Biden's laptop.  After moving to the US from India with her family as a toddler, Gadde and her family faced racism as she grew up in Beaumont, Texas, where she has said her father had to seek approval from the Ku Klux Klan to sell insurance door-to-door.  Now the mother of a young child, Gadde has built a remarkable career, spending a decade at elite Silicon Valley law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati and working in the legal department at Juniper Networks before joining Twitter in 2011. Federal records show that she has also donated regularly to Democratic candidates, contributing more than $18,000 over the past two decades, and most recently supporting Kamala Harris with a $2,700 check in 2019. A Twitter spokesperson did not immediately respond to an inquiry from DailyMail.com on Thursday afternoon seeking comment from Gadde or the company.  As Twitter's chief legal officer and general counsel, Gadde exercises enormous power at the company, where she has long essentially had final say over who is allowed on the platform, and what they can tweet. In an interview with Bloomberg, Gadde once said that Twitter's former CEO Jack Dorsey left the creation and enforcement of content policies up to her.   'He rarely weighs in on an individual enforcement decision,' Gadde told the outlet. 'I can't even think of a time. I usually go to him and say, 'this is what's going to happen.'' Although she maintains a low profile, that power has put Gadde at the center of some of Twitter's most controversial moderation decisions, including the decision to permanently ban Trump after his supporters stormed the US Capitol in January 2021. She also signed off on Twitter's move to block the sharing of links to a New York Post article based on files from Hunter Biden's abandoned laptop soon before the 2020 election.  The Post's Twitter account was also suspended for roughly two weeks. Later reporting, including from DailyMail.com, confirmed the laptop's authenticity. Gadde hit the headlines again this week after she reportedly broke down in tears while briefing her 350 employees on Musk's successful $44 billion bid to acquire Twitter.  When political podcast host Saagar Enjeti tweeted that Gadde was instrumental in the decision to temporarily suspend the New York Post's account, Musk replied: 'Suspending the Twitter account of a major news organization for publishing a truthful story was obviously incredibly inappropriate.' On Wednesday he doubled down on the criticism of Gadde, sharing a meme with his 86 million followers showing Gadde and suggesting the company's decisions are affected by a 'left wing bias.' But Musk's tweets drew furious backlash from Dick Costolo, who was the CEO of Twitter between 2010 and 2015. Costolo replied to Musk: 'What's going on? You're making an executive at the company you just bought the target of harassment and threats.'  In a subsequent tweet, the former Twitter boss wrote: 'Bullying is not leadership.' Musk hit back: 'What are talking about? I'm just saying Twitter needs to be politically neutral.' He appeared to elaborate more on this point by tweeting: 'For Twitter to deserve public trust, it must be politically neutral, which effectively means upsetting the far right and the far left equally'. Current Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal also appeared to respond obliquely to the controversy, tweeting he was proud of 'our people' who managed to stay focused despite the 'noise'. 'I took this job to change Twitter for the better, course correct where we need to, and strengthen the service,' he said. 'Proud of our people who continue to do the work with focus and urgency despite the noise.' Though she is now in the spotlight, Gadde has long appeared keen to maintain a low profile. She was described in a 2020 Politico profile as 'the most important Silicon Valley executive you've never heard of.' Managing a team of 350, in 2021 she earned $17 million: a base salary of $600,000, plus a bonus of $450,000 and almost $400,000 in personal security. The rest was from shares.  Born in India and moving to Beaumont, Texas, when she was two years old, she recalls her engineer father having to go to the KKK to ask permission to sell insurance door-to-door. She later said that the unjust situation was what inspired her to become a lawyer.  The family later moved to New Jersey, and Gadde graduated with a law degree from New York University in 2000.  'I felt very strongly that I needed to be in a position where I understood my rights, or my community's rights,' she told Politico. 'I didn't ever want to be taken advantage of.' Though Gadde was previously married to fellow attorney Ramsey Homsany, the couple filed for divorce in 2014 in what appears to be an amicable split without any children, court records show.  It's unclear whether she later remarried, but Gadde does have a young child who was born around 2017.   Gadde joined Silicon Valley law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, where she worked for a decade before becoming Senior Director in the legal department of Juniper Networks in Silicon Valley.  She joined Twitter in 2011, and became co-founder and then-CEO Jack Dorsey's right-hand woman, sitting next to him and accompanying him on his meetings in Congress and at the White House. In October 2019 she was the architect of the idea to stop political advertising on the platform, and shortly before the election she played a key role in the decision to suspend The New York Post's account when it reported on Hunter Biden's laptop. Twitter claimed it violated the company policy against promoting hacked material; critics were angered by the heavy-handedness, and Twitter later apologized. In January 2021, it was Gadde who rang Dorsey - on vacation in Hawaii - to inform him they were banning Donald Trump, for violating policies against inciting violence.   Gadde is also a co-founder of #Angels, an investment collective that backs start-ups and helps ensure that women receive equal compensation at successful companies. She is also on the board of medical charity Mercy Corps.",
  "118d7a81bc43751df17353bc71bb23d9e6da7479b50b9bc2d8b588b4": "Disgraced Merrill Lynch financier James Iannazzo, who was arrested after hurling a smoothie at a Robeks worker and branding her a 'f**king immigrant loser,' has avoided a criminal conviction after being accepted into a one-year rehabilitation program. Iannazzo will be supervised by the Connecticut Office of Adult Probation for 12-months, and if he completes it all charges against him - including intimidation based on bias, breach of peace and criminal trespass - will be dropped. The probation program is offered to defendants without previous convictions and who are deemed unlikely to re-offend. Iannazzo said he was planning to apply to the program during a March 9 court appearance. He has also been ordered to donate $500 to the Office of Victim Services. The financier triggered public outcry after a TikTok showing him going on a racist rant and hurling a smoothie at teenage employees at a Robeks smoothie store in Connecticut went viral in January.  He was caught on camera roaring: 'I want to speak to the person who made this f**king drink. Is that you? 'You don't know who made it? Stupid f**king ignorant high school kids. I want to speak to the f**king manager. Get the f**k out of here you f**king bitch. Give it to me now.' At that point, he hurled the drink, which hit an employee and spilled all over her, before staff told him to leave while calling the police. Iannazzo continued: ' 'F**k you, you f**king bitch. I want the telephone, right now. Shut the f**k up, you f**king stupid (inaudible). I want the f**king phone. Shut up. 'You f**king immigrant loser. I want the f**king telephone.'   Iannazo claimed he lost his temper and 'his paternal instinct kicked in' after staff prepared a smoothie containing peanut butter, which caused his 17-year-old son to go into anaphylactic shock. He claimed he had warned staff that his son was allergic to nuts, while staff claimed that he requested there be no peanut butter but failed to mention an allergy.   'I was out of my mind with fear for him when I returned to Robeks, and I wish I had not done so,' Iannazzo said afterwards. 'I also wish they had been more careful preparing my son's beverage. I will be extending my apologies personally to the Robeks organization, particularly the staff that was working there that night.' Iannazo was fired from his job at Merrill Lynch - where he had worked since 1995, most recently as a vice president of wealth management - after the clip was widely-shared online. 'Our company does not tolerate behavior of this kind. We immediately investigated and have taken action. This individual is no longer employed at our firm,' the company said in a statement after the video became viral.  After the incident Iannazzo was arrested on charges of intimidation based on bias, breach of peace and criminal trespass before being released. 'It was kind of scary, I'm not going to lie because I'm like 'I don't know his intention or what he was going to do,' 18-year-old Gianna Miranda, who works part-time at the Robeks told local news station WFSB. 'He started to call her racial slurs. He threatened to kill us multiple times,' Hill, who is 17 according to the social media platform, also told the outlet. 'I understand and we are sorry on behalf of Robeks for how the smoothie was made, but it gives you absolutely no right to act out like that.'",
  "31ce61268b6be694bcf79032741d52df17e26762287e780e43041acd": "Amazon delivered a disappointing quarter and outlook on Thursday as the ecommerce giant was swamped by higher costs and online shopping declined in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Shares of the company fell 10 percent in extended trading after the company reported its first net loss since 2015, a $3.8 billion hit due in part to its investment in Rivian Automotive. After a long-running surge in sales during the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, Amazon's outlook has dimmed as life returns to normal. The company's expenses swelled as it offered higher pay to attract workers during a labor shortage, and even then it could not fully staff warehouses.  A fulfillment center in New York City voted to create Amazon's first U.S. union, a result the retailer is contesting.  And higher fuel prices are eating into consumers' disposable income while making delivery more expensive for Amazon. The Seattle-based company parried by raising fees. Partway through the just-ended first quarter, Amazon hiked the price of its fast-shipping club Prime, which has garnered more than 200 million subscribers, by 17 percent to $139 annually in the United States.  Effective Thursday, it is imposing an average 5 percent fuel and inflation surcharge on merchants that use Amazon's U.S. warehousing services as well. Amazon's forecast shows these actions may not be enough to counter such challenges.  The company expects to lose as much as $1 billion in operating income this quarter, or make as much as $3 billion. That's down from an operating profit of $7.7 billion in the same period last year. 'The pandemic and subsequent war in Ukraine have brought unusual growth and challenges,' said Amazon CEO Andy Jassy in a statement.  Jassy said the company has finally met its warehouse staffing and capacity needs, but it still has work to do in improving productivity.  'This may take some time, particularly as we work through ongoing inflationary and supply chain pressures, but we see encouraging progress on a number of customer experience dimensions, including delivery speed performance as we're now approaching levels not seen since the months immediately preceding the pandemic in early 2020,' he said.  The division that Jassy ran before becoming CEO last year, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has traditionally been a bright spot for the company. The unit increased revenue 37 percent to $18.4 billion, slightly ahead of analysts' estimates. In retail, the e-commerce giant has had mixed results turning to brick-and-mortar stores to power food delivery and meet consumers wherever they wished to shop.  Amazon said in March it planned to close all 68 of its bookstores, pop-ups and other home goods shops, as it focuses on grocery stores.  It recently automated two Whole Foods Market locations to make them cashierless. The company's physical store sales grew 17 percent to $4.6 billion. Still, Amazon's outlook reflects broader industry challenges. U.S. government data shows that online retail sales fell 6.4 percent in March after declining 3.5 percent the month prior, the first back-to-back drop since the last two months of 2020.  Some economists attributed the change to household budgets strained from higher gasoline prices, while others blamed shifting seasonal patterns.  Just this week, a major Amazon delivery partner, United Parcel Service Inc, said it expected e-commerce delivery growth to slow.

  "af85a7bc6659c55838184fe224e7a63e9f4943ea012ef34b1ea8f62c": "House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is being trolled in his own district by the group the Republican Accountability Project, which has gone after Republicans supportive of former President Donald Trump's election fraud lies.  The group - led by anti-Trump commentator Bill Kristol - purchased space on Bakersfield, California billboards that now read:  'We've heard the tapes, Kevin. Stop lying about January 6th.'  The New York Times has been releasing audio clips from a January 10, 2021 call where McCarthy, speaking to House leadership, floats asking Trump to resign during the aftermath of the January 6 Capitol attack.  McCarthy, his No. 2 House Minority Whip Steve Scalise and his then No. 3 former House Republican Conference Chair Rep. Liz Cheney, also discussed a number of inflammatory statements made by their own GOP members.  Kristol's group supports 'principled Republicans,' which in their view is only defined by members of the GOP who didn't contest the 2020 election during the January 6 vote, which was interrupted by the Capitol attack.  More recently, Kristol has gone as far as to endorse Democrats, including Democratic Virginia gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe, to expunge Trump's influence from the party, despite GOP candidate Glenn Youngkin not necessarily espousing pro-MAGA beliefs.  Youngkin won the November race.   McCarthy remains with the majority of his party.  On Wednesday morning McCarthy reportedly smoothed things over and was given a standing ovation by fellow House Republicans after he defended his comments from the tapes.   'He's widely supported. Will be speaker,' one source in the room told The Washington Post.  CNN's Melanie Zanona reported that McCarthy told colleagues that he was just floating scenarios when he told Republican leadership during a January 10 call that former President Donald Trump should resign.  McCarthy and his allies were also caught complaining about the rhetoric used by fellow GOP lawmakers including Reps. Matt Gaetz, Mo Brooks, Lauren Boebert and Barry Moore during a private phone call in the days following the January 6 Capitol attack.  On Tuesday, The New York Times released fresh audio clips of McCarthy on the call with Scalise, then-House Republican Conference Chair Cheney, Rep. Tim Emmer and a handful of Congressional aides, where he relayed his fears that remarks by a vocal fringe minority could lead to violence.  'Tension is too high, the country is too crazy,' McCarthy warned on the January 10 call. 'I do not want to look back and think we caused something or we missed something and someone got hurt. I don't want to play politics with any of that.'  The Washington Post also reported that Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who was also briefly brought up on the call, said at the meeting Wednesday morning that Scalise needed to apologize for his remarks.   In one clip from the call, McCarthy is heard discussing comments Gaetz made on Newsmax, where he went after fellow Republicans for being 'anti-Trump.' One of the Republicans Gaetz was critical of was Cheney, who blasted the outgoing president after the January 6 insurrection.   'This is serious stuff people are doing that has to stop,' the top House Republican grumbled, mentioning briefings he was receiving from the FBI. 'I'm calling Gaetz, I'm explaining to him, I don't know if I have much to say, but I'm going to have some other people call him too,' McCarthy continued. 'This is serious s**t, to cut this out.'  Scalise pushed that 'it's potentially illegal what he's doing.'  'Well, he's putting people in jeopardy,' McCarthy said. 'And he doesn't need to be doing this. We saw what people would do in the Capitol, you know, and these people came prepared with rope, with everything else.'  Scalise also pointed to comments made by Brooks and Rep. Louie Gohmert, including how Brooks said at the 'Save America' rally before the Capitol Attack that 'today is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.'  'You got the Maxine Waters and all that stuff too, I know the Dems are in a very strong positions to drive a lot of things, but our members have got to start paying attention to what they say too, we can't put up with that type of s**t,' McCarthy said.  In the past, Republicans have gone after Waters, a California Democrat, for some of her rhetoric.   'You think the president deserves to be impeached for his comments? That's almost something that goes further than what the president said,' McCarthy said of Brooks' 'kicking ass' line.  On the call, Cheney brought up Boebert, pointing out that she had tweeted members' movements during the January 6 attack.  McCarthy asked if Greene - often linked to Boebert over their shared, now disavowed, interest in QAnon - had been a speaker at former President Donald Trump's 'Save America' rally.  McCarthy is also told about tweets made from Moore.  'Wow, we have more arrests for stealing a podium on January 6 than we do for stealing an election on November 3, Atlanta, Philadelphia and Detroit would be places I'd reccomend you start,' Moore wrote before deleting his personal Twitter account.  On the death of capitol rioter Ashli Babbitt he commented, 'I understand it was a black police officer who shot the white female veteran.' 'You know that doesn't fit the narrative,' the Alabama Republican tweeted.  After Moore's tweets were read aloud on the call, both McCarthy and Cheney are heard murmuring, 'wow.'   'Can't they take their Twitter accounts away, too?' McCarthy then said.  The sound bites released Tuesday were from the same call in which McCarthy told GOP leadership he'd tell Trump to resign - comments he continues to deny, despite the recording being released publicly.  The January 10 call was revealed by New York Times reporters Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns, in a preview of their new book, This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden and the Battle for America's Future. The comments prompted January 6 House select committee Chairman Bennie Thompson to announce Tuesday that the panel would issue 'another invitation' to McCarthy to testify.  Then the Democrat-led committee - which includes Republicans Cheney and Rep. Adam Kinzinger - will decide whether to subpoena McCarthy and other Republicans, Punchbowl News said.  ",

A trail cam captured the cute moment the wild animal took a late-night bath in a pond south of Lake Tahoe April 25. Toogee Sielsch, whose @tahoetoogee Instagram account includes hidden cam footage of the lake's animal population in the woods, shared the video on social media, along with the caption: 'You think you love bath time? Think again.' 'From a young age I've been more of a shower guy, but hey, I admire this South Lake Tahoe black bear's bath time zeal!,' Sielsch added. The gigantic bear can be seen in the black-and-white footage fully immersing itself around 10 p.m. in the water. The video shows the bear turning on its back, and rocking back and forth in the water. It eventually gets back on its four paws, shaking its fur to dry off.  The California Department of Fish and Wildlife issued a warning to Lake Tahoe residents over potential increased bear sightings as the animals come out from hibernation in time for the start of spring. There are roughly 15,000 bears in the Lake Tahoe basin area.  The warnings come after a gigantic Lake Tahoe bear, nicknamed Hank the Tank, shot to fame in February when he was caught on camera rifling for scraps. Hank, who weighs about 500 pounds, wandered around Lake Tahoe homes in search of a meal bigger than his appetite. The bear has been spotted in the neighborhood more than 100 times since July and nothing - loud noises, paintballs, or Tasers - can scare him off. Local residents have described Hank as 'gentle' and said he just eats and leaves without causing any real trouble. But wildlife officials said locals who leave out unsecured food for Hank are making him too bold, California wildlife authorities faced numerous complaints from residents in the resort town as the bear has prompted more than 150 calls to law enforcement and wildlife personnel in the area this year. 'This one individual bear has been linked to property damage at 38 different properties at least,' California Department of Fish and Wildlife spokesman Peter Tira told KCRA 3 in Sacramento on February 17. Authorities added that the curvy cub caused 'extensive property damage and forcefully entered several homes - including occupied homes.' Typically around late November, early December, bears go into torpor, which is a state of physical or mental inactivity, according to the BEAR League, a non-profit organization in the area. For the black bear species, hibernation tends to be more of a response to a shortage of food, decreasing temperatures and snow on the ground.  It can last a few weeks in warmer parts of North America in the Northeast and West Coast, to six months for bears in Alaska.  Experts also said it's best not to wake up a hibernating bear. A bear that can sense danger quickly wakes up. California is home to around 25,000 to 35,000 black bears, according to the USDA Forest Service. Oregon is home to 25,000 to 30,000 and is known as 'Black Bear Country,'  The Parks Department added that bear attacks are 'uncommon' and the animals typically 'avoid human contact,' but reminds the public that it is 'never safe to approach a bear.'",
  "6b825e96eff166f092cc8b2d008ac1e872fddfc8f72fb8047c79eb85": "A bodycam captured the dramatic moment a man and a woman were rescued by sheriff's deputies after being stranded with a single life jacket in Florida.  Around 7:40 pm Monday, the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office's Marine Unit saved two stranded boaters - a man and a woman - who are seen in footage floating aimlessly holding onto a single lifejacket. The HCSO Marine Unit said it was conducting maritime patrols when officials saw a disabled boat with one person on board and two adults in distress nearly 200 yards away from the boat.  Footage of the rescue shows two deputies pull up to the stranded boaters and pull them onto the boat, with one of the deputies telling his partner to help the woman first.  Scroll Down For Video:  The stranded male boater tells the officers: 'Appreciate you,' as they help the woman out of the water.   'It's going to be hard to get up here,' they tell her, but then are able to get her on board.  At that point, the stranded man asks: 'Can I go around the back or...?' motioning to the back of the boat. Officers tell him to remain where he is while the woman is guided to sit on a cooler.  The deputies pull the man on board with a bit more effort. Clearly relieved, he jokes with the deputies, saying they have a 'bad ass boat'. One replies, 'thank you' and then one of the deputies appears to be talking on a radio.   The boaters later were taken back to their boat, which they were able to start up again, and they returned to the marina. Sheriff Chad Chronister expressed gratitude for the Marine Unit that was on patrol.    'Had they not been patrolling the waters, this could have ended very differently,' Chronister said in a statement.  He asked other boaters to use this rescue as a warning. 'Summer is just around the corner,' Chronister added. 'I want to remind all boaters to ensure their vessels are in good condition, and to please, always wear a life jacket. These simple steps could be the difference between a beautiful day out on the water or a tragedy.'",
  "828947163253bc597bbbe2427695b6e3fb64621800b12af34c877937": "Republicans hit back at President Joe Biden on Thursday, a day after he fired a salvo in the education wars by saying parents gave up control of their children at the classroom door. Schools are at the center of one of the fiercest debates in national politics and Biden used a reception for teachers at the White House to say parents 'don't belong to them 'when they're in the classroom.  Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt led the backlash.  'God gave kids to parents - NOT the government,' he tweeted. Other conservatives expressed their anger in ever more graphic terms. 'No they're not your children,' tweeted Sebastian Gorka, former Trump administration official and radio host, 'you senile communist clown.' Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said he had no right to talk about children and schools at all. 'Biden wants Americans to forget about the months he spent perpetuating COVID theater as he stood in lockstep with unions to keep teachers and students out of the classroom and force masks on kids and toddlers,' she said. 'Biden has done irreparable damage to our children and has failed students, teachers, and parents.' On Wednesday the president addressed educators at the 2022 Teacher of the Year ceremony hosted by the White House. 'They're all our children,' he said. 'They are not somebody's else children. They're like yours when they're in the classroom.' Biden also took aim at parents and Republican legislators who have spearheaded efforts to ban books and bar sexually explicit or overly politically correct curriculum.  'Today, there are too many politicians trying to score political points banning books, even math books,' the president said. 'Did you ever think when you'd be teaching you're going to be worried about book burnings and banning books all because it doesn't fit somebody's political agenda?' He added, speaking of teachers: 'We have got to stop making them the target of the culture wars.'  Biden's comments echoed the now-infamous declaration from former Virginia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe who, while on the campaign trail last year, blasted the role parents were playing in his state's education system.  'I'm not going to let parents come into schools and actually take books out and make their own decisions,' he said during a September debate. 'I don't think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.' McAuliffe's opponent, now-Governor Glenn Youngkin, hit back, saying: 'You believe school systems should tell children what to do. I believe parents should be in charge of their kids' education.' Youngkin, who swept to victory in Virginia, had made parental rights in education a staple of his gubernatorial campaign, with his surprise victory largely-credited to his laser focus on Democrats' woke education policies. Unlike Biden, who seemingly seeks less parent involvement in schools, the GOP is leaning on parental education rights as a wedge ahead of the midterm elections, hoping to mobilize Republicans and appeal to independent voters.  HB 1557 was introduced by two Republican members of the Florida Legislature - Representative Joe Harding and Senator Dennis Baxley. They say the bill's aim is to 'empower parents' in their children's education, and make teachers recognize the distinction between 'instruction' and 'discussion.' 'What we're prohibiting is instructing them in a specific direction,' Baxley said about how teachers lead students in a classroom.  'Students can talk about whatever they want to bring up, but sometimes the right answer is, ''You really ought to talk to your parents about that.''' The bill applies to children in kindergarten through third grade. It states that 'classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur.' It also requires districts to 'adopt procedures for notifying a student's parent if there is a change in the student's services or monitoring related to the student's mental, emotional, or physical health or well-being,' something LGBTQ advocates argue could lead to students being outed to their parents without the student's knowledge or consent. It was passed on March 8 in a 22-17 vote. The state House had approved the bill late last month. DeSantis signed it into law on March 28 and it will come into effect on July 1. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has made education a priority in his state, passing numerous bills that spew the parental-choice rhetoric. In March, Florida passed the controversial Parental Rights in Education Bill (HB 1557) - dubbed by critics as the Don't Say Gay bill.  The legislation bans any discussion pertaining to 'sexual orientation' or 'gender identity' in Florida schools for students in kindergarten through third grade.  It will become law on July 1 and teachers who breach its regulations can be sued by parents.  'In Florida, we not only know that parents have a right to be involved, we insist that parents have a right to be involved,' DeSantis said at a press conference on March 28 before he signed the bill in to law.  'We will make sure that parents can send their kids to school to get an education, not an indoctrination.'  Critics, however, say it teaches young kids to believe they are wrong for being different and that forcing schools to report students who are receiving mental health services is taking away a safe space for those students to be themselves. They also claim that the vagueness of the wording could get a teacher in trouble if they make a passing reference to having a same-sex partner.   Even the White House weighed in on what has become the latest culture wars clash, with press secretary Jen Psaki claiming last week it was 'hateful' and 'misinformed'. DeSantis, last week also signed the Stop WOKE Bill into law, banning critical race theory (CRT) as a component in Florida schools, which the governor claims promotes hatred among students and makes individuals feel guilty for racism of the past. 'We believe an important component of freedom in the state of Florida is the freedom from having oppressive ideologies imposed upon you without your consent,' DeSantis said at the bill's signing, WFTS reported.  'Whether it be in the classroom or in the workplace. And we decided to do something about it.'  House Bill 7, also known as the Stop WOKE Bill, specifically outlaws teachings that assert certain individuals are 'inherently racist [or] sexist] - or 'morally superior' - or that characterize individuals' status as 'privileged' or 'oppressed' based on their race, sex or national origin.'  'What we will not allow is to be taught that members of one race, color, national origin or sex are somehow morally superior,' the governor said on Friday. 'We are not gonna allow teaching that a person simply by virtue of his/her race, color, national origin or sex is inherently racist, sexist or oppressive, that's wrong.'  Under the legislation, which also goes into effect on July 1, teachers are allowed to address topics of sexism, racism, slavery, and racial segregation but are not permitted to persuade students to a particular point of view. 'We are not gonna use your tax dollars to teach our kids to hate this country or to hate each other,' DeSantis said. Florida Sen. Manny Diaz, Jr., who pushed the bill through the senate, said the bill was not meant to cover up America's history with racism, but to not blame students for past wrongs.    'It's not about the feel. We can't control how a person feels about a topic,' Diaz told the Washington Post. 'But what we can control is to have a teacher not go to a student ... and impose on a male student that they are sexist simply because they are a considered a male.'  In a move that seems to be sweeping the nation, the Florida Department of Education also rejected 54 math textbooks from its curriculum due to the inclusion of banned material. The state DOE had garnered criticism for tossing out 41 percent of the 132 math textbooks submitted for the next school year last week without listing the rejected books, more than half of which the agency said referenced CRT, with the rest containing Common Core and Social Emotional Learning (SEL).  Last Thursday, the state released four examples of lessons considered unacceptable in the state, including the use of bar graphs that measures levels of racial prejudice based on age and political identity and asks students to solve equations based on the findings. The graphs, which extrapolated data from the Project Implicit Discrimination website, show that those 65 and older and who lean towards the conservative end of the political spectrum have the most racial bias.  Another example of banned material included a lesson plan for polynomials, with one of the problems once again referencing the Implicit Association Test, claiming that the 2 million people who have taken the test have 'slight' or 'moderate' bias, which changes based on age and political identification.  The department said the 54 books banned from the curriculum are prohibited because they are not 'aligned with Florida standards or included prohibited topics and unsolicited strategies.'  The fight over critical race theory in schools has escalated in the United States over the last year. The theory has sparked a fierce nationwide debate in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests around the country over the last year and the introduction of the 1619 Project. The 1619 Project, which was published by the New York Times in 2019 to mark 400 years since the first enslaved Africans arrived on American shores, reframes American history by 'placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans at the center of the US narrative'. The debate surrounding critical race theory regards concerns that some children are being indoctrinated into thinking that white people are inherently racist or sexist. Those against critical race theory have argued it reduces people to the categories of 'privileged' or 'oppressed' based on their skin color. Supporters, however, say the theory is vital to eliminating racism because it examines the ways in which race influence American politics, culture and the law.   Similarly, an Oklahoma library banned a display that was showcasing sexual assault awareness and a proposed 'romance book club' after both were deemed inappropriate.  The Public Library of Enid and Garfield County's Board of Directors had initially said the book club and the sexual assault awareness book display could stay, but then the Enid Public Library's board voted narrowly 3-2 to ban both the display and program. The board reasoned that the display featured content about sexuality, while the book club would discuss sexual topics, and that neither was appropriate for the library.  Enid Public Library's interim director Theri Ray told CNN the projects were shelved 'in accordance with the adopted policy.'  The policy itself is extremely broad and requires the library's programs and exhibits to be 'non-partisan' and 'not make as their object the study of sex, sexual activity, sexual perversion, sex-based classifications, sexual preferences, sexual identity, gender identity, or subjects that are of a sexual nature.'  Book bans have been at the heart of American controversy throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, which many alleging the bans violate the First Amendment.  Communities and education systems often ban books due to sexual imagery, violence and any other content that is deemed obscene.   Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel Uncle Tom's Cabin is widely recognized by historians as the first book in the U.S. to experience a ban on a national scale. In 2020, the American Library Association published a list detailing the top 100 most banned or challenged books nationwide over the last decade. Topping the list was The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian by Sherman Alexie, the Captain Underpants series by Dav Pilkey and Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher. During his speech Wednesday, Biden also shared personal testimony detailing how the educators and loved ones in his life helped him overcome his stutter.  'I wonder how I got here. I got here because of my parents and my teachers,' Biden said in a long, heart-felt deviation from his prepared remarks. 'That idea is exemplified by the national teacher of the year.' The president and First Lady Jill Biden, who continues to teach English at a community college in suburban Washington D.C., cheered for Ohio history teacher Kurt Russell, the 2022 national teacher of the year, and finalists for the award who gathered from each state.  'Teaching is not what Jill does, it's who she is, like most of you,' the president said, before telling the crowd about his problem as a child speaking - especially in class or otherwise publicly - 'when I stuttered, everyone thinks you're stupid. Totally incompetent.'  Biden has talked openly about battling a childhood stutter in the past, including while running for president in 2020. But he stressed on Wednesday the importance of teachers in helping him with that effort. 'I have teachers, I can name the ones through grade school, high school, even college,' the president said. 'I didn't really beat my stutter - and still occasionally I do (stutter) - until I took a speech debate class in college just to force myself to be able to stand up.' Russell summed up his profession by saying, 'Each student needs a champion, no matter what the circumstance are.' That echoed the sentiments of the first lady, who said of great teachers, 'it's not the curriculum or the classroom tactics, it's that smile that tells students that they don't have to be afraid to answer out loud.' 'It's the calm in your voice that can still the wild horses running through their hearts,' she added. 'It's the way that you know that, sometimes, 'I'm fine' means everything is wrong.' When Jill Biden talked about teachers changing lives 'student by student,' her voice began to crack, before she laughed and said 'Now I'm getting emotional.'",
  "96fb9babc6aee2cc0f4f479c8108cf3fe7975b2e1e9a8718b11a9bfe": "The Mexican teenager who was found dead inside a motel water tank was filmed  purchasing liquor with her two female friends and fighting with a young man outside a party, then walking on a road and later running into a motel before her mysterious death, new surveillance camera footage revealed. The videos obtained by Milenio television Wednesday show 18-year-old law student Debanhi Escobar arguing and being chased by an individual the morning of April 9 before she slapped and kicked him. Her two girlfriends and several young men then rushed over to intervene, according to the video. Moments later, another security video camera captured Escobar getting into the  back of a taxi driven by Juan David Cuellar, who snapped the last haunting photograph of Escobar standing on the side of a road. Another video shows Escobar, now sitting in the front passenger seat, getting out of the taxi near the Nueva Castilla Motel, where authorities discovered her body April 21. Prosecutors trying to piece together Escobar's movements after getting out of the cab also released a video showing her walking on a sidewalk and then crossing to the middle of a road before returning to the sidewalk.  She kept walking and briefly stopped in front of Transportes Internacionales Alcosa, a trucking company, at 4:29 am - three minutes after Cuellar took her photo. The attorney general's office provided additional video footage that showed the teenager running towards the motel driveway at 4:35 am and looking through the door of a restaurant located in front of the motel a minute later. Escobar then fell into one of the three uncovered cisterns, hit her head and drowned, according to Eduardo Villagomez, director of the state's forensic services 'She was alive (for a moment) where she was found and there was an opportunity for her to react,' he said. The cause of the death was a contusion to the skull and it is being investigated as a homicide, officials said.    It remains unclear if she accidentally fell into the cistern or was pushed.  The prosecutor's office said that the motel didn't have any surveillance cameras mounted in the area where the water tanks are located.  Attorney general Gustavo Guerrero, who has been trying to show transparency amidst accusations from the teenager's family that information from the investigation has been withheld, also announced the firings of prosecutors Rodolfo Salinas and Javier Caballero from the kidnapping and missing persons units for omitting details. 'We have to put together the puzzle with what we have and what is obtained to clarify the reason for Debanhi's death,' Guerrero said. Mario Escobar still is not ruling out that his daughter was murdered and has considered exhuming her body to conduct a second autopsy. 'There are many hypotheses, like my daughter could have been alive, like could she have been kidnapped, how she fell without seeing, how she could have been placed there,' he said. 'In other words, so that you understand me, we do not rule out any line of investigation. I think I am calm... because they are answering what we have talked about.' The family hopes the new details will help solve the mystery behind Debanhi Escobar's death. 'Unfortunately, my daughter is not here. But what my wife and I are asking for ... is that this case be clarified,' Mario Escobar said. 'We want everything to be clarified for us to be calm. Right now as a family we are calm in the aspect that we have somewhere to cry to my daughter, where to bring her a rose.' Debanhi Escobar was reported missing April after failing to return home following a night out with her two friends. Cuellar picked up the three young women after one of them requested a taxi via the DiDi ride share app. He dropped them off at a bar and gave them his personal number after they asked if he would be available to pick them up later that night. In an interview with INFO7 television on Tuesday night, Cuellar revealed he got a WhatsApp message around 4am from one of the two girls, but when he arrived, Escobar got into the vehicle and the friends took off in a separate car. Once inside the vehicle, Escobar told him that the girls were bad friends because they had left her behind. Cuellar recalled that she cried and he tried to get her home address to drop her off, but she refused to provide it. He then sent a message to one of the girls, requesting directions to Escobar's home, but she too declined to provide it. At one point, Escobar asked for a cellphone charging cable, stepped out from the rear passenger seat and sat in the front. Cuellar said Escobar was making incoherent comments and he again asked for her address. She asked Cuellar to drop her off at another party, but when they got to that location, she didn't get out. Cuellar said he eventually got her home address from her friends, but as he started to drive Escobar there, she asked him to stop and got out. 'That is where I took the photo and I notify her friend that she got out,' said Cuellar, who parked his car and then drove off after she refused to get back inside. 'From the first moment, I wanted to help her,' Cuellar said. 'I told her there was no problem. I'll take you to your house. Just tell me where you live.'",
  "dd1de4b23808ef3af193b30ce1fd8ef8a661834d32cbd8eae1a31f07": "Eleven months after weight-loss cult leader Gwen Shamblin died in a plane crash, survivors of her Tennessee church are coming forward to share horrifying details of the stringent starvation diets and brainwashing they faced - which led one former member to attempt suicide and left another with irreparable damage to her kidneys. 'Gwen broke my family and the only thing I can do is pick up the pieces, because that's what she left,' says Mindy Alvarez, a former member of the Remnant Fellowship Church, in the explosive two-part finale HBO Max docuseries The Way Down, which lifts the lid on the organization and the lasting trauma suffered by many of its members.  For Shamblin, dieting was divine.  Standing in stripper heels, a skin tight dress with stick thin legs and trademark frosted blonde six-inch bouffant - Shamblin was a charismatic church leader who created a Christian diet plan that became its own religion.  Every Saturday and Sunday, she took to the blue backlit stage of Remnant Fellowship under the auspices of God to preach to her 1,500 member flock the way 'to stop bowing down to the refrigerator and how to bow back down to Him.' Members were expected to pledge unshakable devotion to the cause. Should anyone question the controversial doctrine that rejected the Holy Trinity - or worse - gain weight, the consequences were punitive. Her reign of Remnant Fellowship came to an abrupt end on May 29, 2021, when her plane, also carrying six high-ranking church members, crashed into a shallow lake on their way to a MAGA rally. At the time of the accident, the finishing touches were being put on 'The Way Down: God, Greed and the Cult of Gwen Shamblin' which chronicled her rise from weight-loss guru with 'the Weigh Down Diet' plan - to fame, power and money with the founding of Remnant Fellowship in 1999. Now the streaming network is releasing a two-episode coda to The Way Down: God, Greed and the Cult of Gwen Shamblin, which originally aired in October 2021. The second installment explores the fallout from the cult leader's death--and how the insular Christian sect punished people for gaining weight, forced them to starve, urged parents to beat their children into submission, and enforced loyalty to the cause.  Sitting with filmmakers six months later, former member Ge'cobi Pittman says, 'I think I was nervous to speak up for years because Gwen was quick to seek legal action, but I just can't remain silent.'   'It's time that we heal, its time that our voices matter,' Laura Alvarez says. 'Even if it's for one person.'  Raised in the ultra-strict Church of Christ, Shamblin was a trained dietician who started her Weigh Down Workshops in the 1980s. The Weigh Down Workshops were held in churches and as word of mouth spread, grew to more than 250,000 subscribers in over 14,000 churches in 70 countries. She expanded her business throughout the 1990s with a merchandise, t-shirts, hats and a slew of books such as: What would Jesus eat?, The Divine Diet and Body by God. Her 1997 juggernaut was a book she published titled The Weigh Down Diet. Shamblin and her Weigh Down Diet were a 'massive media hit,' Rev. Rafael Martinez, a cult interventionist said. The book sold over 400,000 copies and Shamblin was seen everywhere from 20/20 to Larry King on CNN. She also embarked on national tours where followers would appear onstage holding up their larger clothes for a cheering audience: 'God has taken 86 pounds off of me!' Putting a biblical spin on her approach, Shamblin taught people to 'Honor God within your body.'  'Every time you reach for food, 15 to 20 times a day, run to God instead,' she'd say. In reality, her weight-loss approach was a dressed up version of intuitive eating, a decades-old practice of only eating when you're hungry. Martinez said: 'To her, it was divine revelation.' Terasseee Morris said that she started losing weight immediately. 'I mean like within two months, I had lost 27 pounds. So the program itself works and it's simply proportion control.'  In 1999, Shamblin founded Remnant Fellowship Church in Brentwood, Tennessee, with the emphasis on 'helping people turn away from the love of food and toward a love of God.'  Morris, who lost 138 pounds in 18 months, said that she was told to stop eating to lose more weight. If people didn't lose more than two pounds that week, they were instructed to fast. 'The faster you do it, the holier you are,' she said.  Soon thereafter, Shamblin began preaching that her weight-loss creed was effective at curing all the other perceived ills of the world, touting that Remnant members were able to break 'free from slavery, to drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, overeating and overspending.'  'I got counselled that, 'You need to loose about four pounds a week in order to be in God's good will,'' said Laura Alvarez, in the second installment of The Way Down. 'So then they put me at 10-bites-a-day,' she says. She was also told to fast every other month with absolutely no food, except for a few sips of broth. The extreme starvation diet caused so much damage to Alvarez's body that she got sick when she was pregnant for the first time. When doctors performed a biopsy, they asked if she struggled with bulimia or anorexia. 'I said, 'I starve myself,' and they said, 'Your body ate away its kidneys, that's what it does when you go through starvation.'' Defending her draconian dieting dogma to Larry King once, Shamblin said: 'How, in the Holocaust, did you have all these people getting down real skinny? They ate less food.' According to their website at the time, the church had 150 congregations located all over the world, with more than 1,500 acolytes worldwide, its membership 'has a combined weight loss of 30,000 pounds.' It described itself as a community where 'leaders are PURE...Husbands are kind like Christ, women are submissive, and children obey their parents'. 'How members of Remnant behave is bit like the Handmaid's Tale and Stepford Wives,' said Glen Wingerd, whose daughter Delaney married into the church. Their ultra-disciplined children were dressed in strangely old-fashioned clothing: 'I would say turn of the century ruffles,' says one ex-member, 'and lots of lace. The little boys looked like Little Lord Fauntleroy.' Shamblin's teachings came to focus increasingly on controlling those children.  Gradually, ex-members claim in the doc, church members became more brainwashed by Shamblin's teachings, which grew ever more outrageous.  If a congregant fell ill with cancer, gained weight, or had disobedient children, Shamblin declared that it was 'god's judgment.'  She told her followers that 'They had to repent for bad things they had done, if bad things were happening to them,' explained ex-member Gina Wilson in the doc. 'But they never held that same standard to themselves.'  Another tenant of the Shamblin doctrine was the harsh punishment and treatment of disobedient children. Her fellowship has been accused of inflicting corporal punishment with glue sticks, if they misbehaved.  Two members, Joseph and Sonya Smith, were convicted of murdering their eight-year-old son Josef Smith in 2007. He died after his parents put him a wicker box, Eleanor Odom, assistant district attorney for Cobb County in Georgia who tried the case, said in The Way Down. Josef kept popping up his head so his parents tied up the box with bungee cord so he couldn't get out, she said. 'At the end of the worship service, they didn't hear anything inside the box so they untied the box with the bungee cords and that's when they found Josef nonresponsive.' The EMTS who first responded talked about it being such a bad case, she said, and Josef had injuries pretty much everywhere except for the palms of his hands and the soles of his feet. Ge'cobi Pittman joined The Weigh Down with her mother when she was 14-years-old. 'Perfection was always the goal,' she said. Despite being a valedictorian with full-ride offers to Ivy League schools, she was pressured to move to Tennessee. 'I picked a small school in Nashville because I wanted to be closer to the church.' The ex-Shamblin devotee said she 'hit a breaking point' during her sophomore year and walked away from her scholarship. 'I was trying to be a perfect Division 1 athlete, a perfect student experiencing college for the first time, and then all the pressure to do everything the church wanted me to do while starving myself.'   Pittman recalled having one last conversation with Shamblin before leaving the church in 2015: 'I saw the darkness in her [Shamblin's] eyes finally when she realized that she wasn't able to get me to stay.' Adding, 'I had never seen her like that.' 'One way that cults control people's thinking, it's really simple, they teach you to minimize parts of the story that don't fit, they teach you to deny parts of the story that don't fit,' says cult expert, Adam Brooks. 'Minimize, denial, rewrite the narrative.'  Shamblin reigned with impunity by instilling guilt and fear into her congregants. 'She keeps a list of curses of people that happen to leave the church,' explains Pittman, who was pregnant at the time she quit Remnant. 'I was told that I would be cursed.' When she later suffered a miscarriage, she told HBO: 'I was fully convinced that I was cursed because of my disobedience.' It's taken years for Pittman to recover from the trauma and brainwashing she experienced in the Remnant Fellowship. 'Let's just say I'm happy to be here today because I almost took action a couple times to end the pain.'  Hawking Jesus and a diet plan made Shamblin fabulously wealthy. According to the documentary, she accrued $20million in real estate assets all over the country. She drove a Porsche, and lived in a pre-Civil War plantation home known as Ashlawn. After divorcing her husband of 40 years, Shamblin got remarried in 2018 to Joe Lara, a man best known for a 1989 TV movie Tarzan in Manhattan and the 1990s Tarzan TV series. One former member called him an 'escort' by a former church member in the series. Among the many expensive gifts that Shamblin lavished on her boy-toy were flight lessons. 'When he met Gwen he started to renew his pilot's license because he hadn't flown in seven and a half years until about 2017 when Gwen paid for it,' Natasha Pavlovich, Joe Lara's ex-girlfriend said in the finale of the doc. 'In a very short time, I'd say in a year, he got multiple new flight ratings and he also got a helicopter license.' Lara was piloting the Cessna 501 when it crashed into Percy Priest Lake on May 21, 2021, immediately killing all seven passengers on board, including his wife.  The second half of The Weigh Down series features the haunting moment air traffic control tried desperately in vain to contact the plane.  Shamblin afforded the high-life on the backs of her congregants. Within Remnant Fellowship, there were real estate and financial planning companies. Exodus Industries, which is the business arm of the church, built custom homes and provide plumbing, electrical work and air conditioning work. 'Everyone worked for free,' said Mindy Alvarez in the second installment of The Way Down. 'She would tell them 'You're doing it for God.' 'Everybody in the church, the congregation - were the workers, were cooks, there was daycare, there was everything, while they're making their money.' As a Spanish speaker, Mindy spearheaded The Weigh Down method to the Latin community in Arizona. 'Before I moved to Nashville they offered me a job,' she tells HBO. 'They offered to meet my pay, which at that time was probably $21 -$22 an hour.' When Mindy got her first paycheck for $8-an-hour, she asked Shamblin about the discrepancy. 'And I'll never forget this, she said, 'Mindy you need to humble yourself. This is your pay and never ever expect a raise.'  'I was sorry because I thought that I wasn't humble, and I shouldn't ask for more and that I should be content.' Mindy was also expected to work on the weekends, but because it was officially considered 'church time,' she never got paid for those days.'  Her daughter Laura, who also speaks in the finale of the series, says, 'she never saw her kids.'  'Gwen broke my family, and the only thing I can do is pick up the pieces because that's what she left,' Mindy told HBO. Shamblin promoted the notion that great things came to those who bowed before God, and that bad events were the consequence of unfaithfulness. Thus, her untimely demise, was an enormous complication for the church that sent them into an identity crises tailspin.  'When bad things happen, its God's judgement so if he takes seven of your leaders out at the same time, what other message could have been sent?' According them, this is gods judgment,' says Helen Byrd, an ex-devotee. 'A lot of what cults often do in situations like this is very Orwellian,' explained cult expert Adam Brooks. 'It will be almost ignored because it doesn't fit their narrative, that their leader was struck down in an accident that god could have protected her from.' Since The Way Down: God, Greed and the Cult of Gwen Shamblin first premiered in late 2021, the Remnant Fellowship has countered the negative publicity in a series of promotional videos that encourage inclusivity and emphasize their 'family friendly' values.  In one snip, a man wearing a white doctor's coat and goofy smile named Otis Rickman says, 'One of the things I'd like to touch on as we talk about people loosing weight or gaining weight is everyone is different. God made us all different so we have big sturdy muscular people, we have thin wispy people, we have just all kinds of people.' 'Otis Rickman put out this video that everybody's body is different right? And that nobody gets shunned or shamed or whatever when his wife was sat out of the church because she had gained wait, so that's a lie,' says Helen Byrd. 'It's the God**** remix!' As far as the future of the church without its dolled-up preacher, only time will tell. But the series offers some insights into the future of Shamblin's ministry without her guiding the way. While her daughter, Elizabeth Hannah, is expected to be heir-apparent, she has yet to officially take over the reigns. Instead, she's become more of a spectral Oz character, who patches in from behind the scenes over the loud speaker during service on the weekend. Elizabeth's husband, Brandon was one of the seven victims of the plane crash. 'I know that a lot of you have wondered how I'm doing, and if I'm throwing in the towel,' she says while speaking to her followers over the sound system from seclusion. 'Considering what has just happened I am doing very well, and I am very strong and my children are very strong. I just want to keep letting everybody know that even though I haven't been there recently, the precious leadership has allowed me to have a little time off.' Ex-member, Gina Wilson tells HBO: 'I don't know how Elizabeth is going to be able to do it, she's lost her husband, her mother and her best friend, but she was trained mightily by Gwen to be her mockingbird.'

  "50c092134b3ec2a1d24dd5c130ab98ccf65fb9e0a326e53c36024d50": "Sophie, Countess of Wessex hugged a group of children today on the final day of her Caribbean tour to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee as she and husband Prince Edward were all smiles while visiting a school in Saint Lucia. The Earl and Countess of Wessex visited Camille Henry Memorial School in the capital of Castries at the end of their week-long tour which has also taken them to Antigua and Barbuda, and St Vincent and the Grenadines. Sophie, who was wearing a long white dress, and Edward, who had a blazer and open-necked shirt, laughed as they spoke with the boys and girls and watched a performance - and they were also presented with gifts.  The school trip this morning came one day after the Queen was urged to apologise by Caribbean protesters seeking reparations after the Wessexes initially received a mixed reception during their visit to Saint Lucia. Edward and Sophie initially received a warm welcome to the island during a walkabout in the town of Soufriere, but were soon met by a group of around ten protesters before a trip to a cocoa plantation. One protester, who would not provide his name, told the PA news agency: 'We want reparations now. The Queen of England needs to apologise for slavery.' Another smiled and said: 'London Bridge is falling down.' The demonstrators displayed banners reading 'repatriation with reparations' and 'Queen say sorry' while playing drums and chanting. The protests follow similar demonstrations in St Vincent and the Grenadines, where some held signs saying 'compensation now' and 'Britain your debt is outstanding'. The earl and countess were also urged to use their 'diplomatic influence' to provide 'reparatory justice' by the prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda during a visit to the country on Monday. Edward was criticised for his 'disinterest' in Gaston Browne's speech by anti-monarchist campaigners, after he was seen nervously laughing when asked to respond. The earl joked that he had not been taking notes during Mr Browne's opening remarks, so could not respond to all the points he had made. The prime minister did not laugh at the comment. Sophie and Edward initially experienced the warmest welcome they had received on their Caribbean tour during a walkabout in the town of Soufriere, with one man saying to Edward: 'I salute you, my prince.' The earl spoke to a road sweeper with a broom who was standing in front of the small crowd, and joked 'I hope you keep this lot in order' while pretending to wave the broom. Sophie and Edward were cheered as they left the area. The couple arrived at the Main Jetty in Soufriere by boat on Wednesday ahead of a busy schedule of engagements. The countess was presented with a bouquet of flowers by a boy named Carlos Baptise, 11, who has a spinal injury called congenital scoliosis. The couple then travelled past the small group of protesters to the Fond Doux Cocoa Plantation where they learned about the contribution of cocoa to Saint Lucia's economy. The countess had a go at grinding cocoa beans before meeting representatives from female-led businesses to hear about the impact of Covid-19 on trade and tourism. She also tried painting a purse at one of the stations, while the earl was taken to where the cocoa beans are dried in the sun. The pair then visited Sulphur Springs, where they were told about the history and evolution of the volcano. The countess put her hand in the water and said: 'It's as warm as a hot bath.' Sophie and Edward then had lunch with Saint Lucia's prime minister before travelling to Soufriere's Mini Stadium, where the earl and countess watched a performance celebrating the island's young people.     The couple joined in with dancers as they both waved small Saint Lucian flags. They then met and posed for photos with youngsters from a number of schools, including Soufriere's infant, primary, comprehensive and special education schools. Meanwhile, the Queen looked on cheery form today as she held a face-to-face audience with the president of Switzerland at Windsor Castle - her first official engagement since a week-long break on the Sandringham estate. The monarch smiled broadly as she shook hands and posed for photographs with Ignazio Cassis and his wife Paola in her Oak Room sitting room. Yesterday evening, her second son, the disgraced Duke of York, was stripped of his Freedom of York by councillors in the city, amid further calls for him to have his dukedom removed. The Queen returned to her Berkshire castle a day ago after staying at the late Duke of Edinburgh's Wood Farm cottage where she celebrated her 96th birthday. She stood without her walking stick and was dressed in a blue and grey paisley-style patterned silk dress for the audience on Thursday. She was wearing her fruit-themed sapphire and diamond grapes brooch, which features a sapphire bow and 16 small diamonds shaped like a bunch of grapes. It was inherited from the Queen Mother. Buckingham Palace said the sovereign is hoping to attend the State Opening of Parliament in less than two weeks' time, on May 10, but confirmation is expected closer to the time or on the day. Her high-profile Platinum Jubilee celebrations are just over a month away. The Queen, who has experienced mobility issues in recent months, has opened Parliament on all but two occasions during her reign. The exceptions were in 1959 and 1963, when she was pregnant with Andrew and then Prince Edward, when her speech was read by the Lord Chancellor.",
  "c585eed99e1cbaf9638c9049d34fcdba1e264baea2074040c6fc5371": "Russia must not be allowed to block Ukrainian grain exports and ramp up global prices, Ben Wallace warned today. The Defence Secretary said it is 'incredibly important' that Vladimir Putin's forces do not control the Black Sea, and the UK could supply anti-ship missiles. He also urged Western allies to help prise Moscow's forces out of the country like 'a limpet off the rock' - suggesting warplanes and tanks could be offered. The comments came as the UK Ministry of Defence said that despite the losses of the cruiser Moskva and the landing ship Saratov, Russia's Black Sea Fleet retains the ability to strike targets in Ukraine. In its latest intelligence assessment it said the Russian navy currently had around 20 vessels in the area, including submarines. Mr Wallace said it was vital that Ukraine, which previously supplied around 7 per cent of the world's wheat, continued to have access to the Black Sea as an outlet for its exports. There have been fears spiking food prices will add to the cost-of-living pain for families, already struggling to cope with soaring fuel and energy bills. 'We have said we will source and supply, if we can, anti-ship missiles,' Mr Wallace told Sky News. 'It's incredibly important that the grain that affects us all, the food prices, does get to get out of Ukraine, that the Russians can't control the Black Sea.' In a keynote speech yesterday, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the objective should be to drive Russia out of 'the whole of Ukraine'. Mr Wallace said it had always been the position of the international community that Russia should withdraw from Ukrainian territory since President Vladimir Putin's annexation of Crimea. However, he said there was 'a long way to go' before the Ukrainians were able to reclaim the land it lost in 2014. He said the Russians appeared to be preparing to dig in to the territory they seized in the east of the country in their latest invasion. 'We've constantly said that Russia should leave Ukraine sovereign territory so that hasn't changed,' he said. 'I think it's certainly the case that Putin, having failed in nearly all objectives, may seek to consolidate what he's got, sort of fortify and dig in, as he did in 2014, and just be a sort of cancerous growth within the country of Ukraine and make it very hard for people to move them out of those fortified positions,' he said. 'So I think it's really about if we want this to not happen, we have to help Ukrainians effectively get the limpet off the rock and keep the momentum pushing them back.' In her speech at the Mansion House, Ms Truss said the crisis in Ukraine should be a 'catalyst' for an overhaul to the West's approach to international security. She said the UK needed to strengthen its military while building alliances with free nations around the world, using their economic power to deter aggressors who 'do not play by the rules'. The G7 group of leading industrialised nations should act as an 'economic Nato' defending collective prosperity, while the Western military alliance must be prepared to open its doors to countries such as Finland and Sweden. Ms Truss singled out China, which has refused to condemn the invasion of Ukraine, while increasing imports from Russia and commenting on 'who should or shouldn't be a Nato member'. 'China is not impervious. They will not continue to rise if they do not play by the rules,' she said. 'China needs trade with the G7. We have shown with Russia the kind of choices that we're prepared to make when international rules are violated.'",
  "3db415f5ecfdbf50fb533e06b27ee59743a1f393377e21daa8b779c7": "President Joe Biden on Thursday asked Congress for an additional $33 billion in military and humanitarian assistance for the Ukraine, which officials say could fund the war there for the next five months. Biden said the previous money allocated for the Ukrainians has been spent. 'Basically we're out of money,' he said in remarks at the White House.  The money includes $20.4 billion in additional security and military assistance, $8.5 billion in economic assistance, and $3 billion in humanitarian assistance. 'We need to contribute arms funding ammunition and the economic support to make their courage and sacrifice have purpose so they can continue this fight and do what they're doing. It's critical this funding gets approved and approved as quickly as possible,' Biden said. 'We have to do our part as well leading the alliance. The cost of this fight, it's not cheap, but caving to aggression is going to be more costly if we allow it to happen. We either back Ukrainian people as they defend their country or we stand by as Russia continues it atrocities and aggression in Ukraine,' he noted. The humanitarian assistance includes funds for high thermal blankets, medical supplies, emergency health kits, safe drinking water, direct food support such as wheat and flour, job training, trauma-informed mental health services, and funding for schools. Biden said the funding for food will help ease rising prices back in the United States.  Ukraine is a major producer of wheat and sunflowers. The war there has disrupted the supply line and caused a price hike. 'This one is going to help ease rising food prices at home as well and abroad,' Biden claimed.  The $33 billion request is more than double the $13 billion that Biden asked for last month and lawmakers approved. The Biden administration has sent more than $2.4 billion in assistance to the Ukraine. 'The president's funding request is what we believe it needed to enable Ukraine success over the next five months of this war,' a senior administration official told reporters on a briefing call.  Biden, in a letter to lawmakers formally making the request, appeared to ask Congress to tie the Ukraine aid to $22.5 billion in covid pandemic response funding he requested in March. Democrats wanted to tie Ukraine and covid aid together as Republicans tried to tie an effort to extend the Title 42 health order at the border to the covid funding request.  But White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Thursday that was not the case. 'We're not making a predetermination of that from here,' she said at her press briefing. 'We put forward both of these funding are requested because they're both vital. They're both important. We need them both to help the Ukrainians and to help ensure we're continuing our COVID programs here in this country and around the world. But we're not going to predetermine for Congress, how they move forward.'  Biden said the covid money is urgently needed to have money for additional vaccines and theraputics in order stop the spread of the disease in the U.S. and abroad. 'The reason we were so successful in the past is because I was able to work with drug manufacturers to order significant quantities of material we needed ahead of time to get in the front of the line. Without additional funding, we can't preorder the amount of vaccines we need and we risk losing our spot in line for vaccines,' he said.  Republican senators, however, had said without a vote on an amendment on Title 42, then there will be no covid funding bill. Democrats in the Senate need at least 10 Republican votes to move the legislation forward but leaders are in a tough spot as enough Democrats may support the Title 42 amendment to get it attached.  Biden also wants to sell the luxury yachts and opulent apartments the U.S. government has seized from Russian oligarchs and then send that money to the Ukraine to help them fight off Vladimir Putin's forces.   The president on Thursday asked Congress to expand his presidential powers to allow him to do just that. 'Seize yachts, fund the war,' White House chief of staff Ron Klain tweeted about the request. Additionally, Biden asked lawmakers for billions of dollars in additional U.S. spending to help the Ukrainian military and provide humantarian assistance for its displaced population. And he asked lawmakers to make it a criminal offense for a person to 'knowingly or intentionally possess proceeds directly obtained from corrupt dealings with the Russian government,' double the statute of limitations for foreign money laundering offenses to 10 years, and expand the definition of 'racketeering' under U.S. law to include efforts to evade sanctions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said last week that his country had - thus far - suffered $550 billion in economic damage since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion. The country is seeking at least $5 billion per month in international emergency aid. Biden's request comes as there has been a bipartisan push in Washington to more aggressively punish the Russian elite, a group of billionaires - many of whom have made their money off of Putin's regime. The Biden administration has already sanctioned about two dozen oligarchs and their family members, even targeting Putin himself. More than a dozen yachts, worth approximately $2.5 billion, have been seized in several countries worldwide, including the 'Tango' - a 254-foot yacht to Viktor Vekselberg, a billionaire and close Putin ally, that is worth an estimated $120 million.  It was seized by the U.S. from its Spanish port earlier this month. It was the first U.S. seizure of an oligarch's yacht since Attorney General Merrick Garland and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen assembled a task force known as REPO -- short for Russian Elites, Proxies and Oligarchs --  to enforce the sanctions put in place after Putin invaded the Ukraine. The federal government 'has sanctioned and blocked vessels and aircraft worth over $1 billion, as well as frozen hundreds of millions of dollars of assets belonging to Russian elites in U.S. bank accounts,' the White House said.  The administration also noted that European Union member states have reported freezing over $30 billion in assets, including almost $7 billion in boats, helicopters, real estate and artwork.  Russia's billionaires control roughly 30 percent of the nation's wealth.  And lawmakers already have pushed to use those seized assets to help the Ukraine.  The House on Wednesday passed a mostly symbolic measure urging Biden to sell the oligarchs' frozen assets to give the money to the Ukraine military and humanitarian assistance.   The legislation is nonbinding, but its 417-to-8 passage reflected the desire among Democrats and Republicans to more aggressively tamp down on Russia. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said it would be taken up by the Senate, where it is expected to pass.   But the Justice Department needs a congressional change in statue to sort through the mess of legal issues that will need to be unraveled so the United States to repurpose the yachts and extravagant apartments into de facto reparations for Ukrainians. In his State of the Union address on March 1, President Biden warned oligarchs that the U.S. and European allies would 'find and seize your yachts, your luxury apartments, your private jets.' 'We are coming for your ill-begotten gains,' he said.",
  "a43301768b4b21f59ee8ce857ea9878fa401775c5152895d0e743dab": "Kenosha's city council fell into chaos this week during discussions over a proposed taxpayer-funded memorial for one of the men killed by Kyle Rittenhouse after an attendee questioned the commission's move to table the proposal instead of voting it down. The Monday meeting, which was captured on video, saw the city's five-person Parks Commission delay a decision that would have placed a memorial and plaque in a city park to honor Anthony Huber, an ex-convict skateboarder shot dead by Rittenhouse during a Black Lives Matter protest in 2020. Video shows Huber, 26, chasing after a then-17-year-old Rittenhouse on August 25, 2020, swinging his skateboard at the teen before being fatally shot in the chest.  Rittenhouse was acquitted of the murder last year. He was also cleared for shooting dead one other person and wounding another.  Huber's girlfriend, Hannah Gittings, requested the memorial be put up earlier this month, public documents filed by the commission show, on a tree in Anderson Park. The proposal garnered national attention earlier this week, after Kevin Mathewson, a former Kenosha alderman who now works as an investigative journalist, received a tip early Monday morning about the then-unreported request. Mathewson, who served on the commission with three of the five current aldermen - including chair Eric Haugaard - then sent out an email blast about the proposal's existence, and wrote about it on his website, Kenosha County Eye. The proposal soon became the subject of scrutiny by both the press and outraged citizens of Kenosha - who showed up in droves to the commission meeting to voice their opposition to the planned tribute. Mathewson, who also attended the meeting and recorded the proceedings to post to YouTube, told DailyMail.com Thursday that he believes the council members planned to quietly the proposal Monday, and would have if its existence had remained under the radar. Scroll down for video:  'There's not a doubt in my mind it would have passed,' Matthewson told DailyMail.com in an interview, noting the meetings usually don't garner such attendance. 'They didn't expect a bunch of people to be there.' Mathewson's footage of the meeting, which was streamed live and has since garnered more than 35,000 views, shows a slew of citizens voicing their concerns regarding the memorial, spurring the city officials to vote 3-2 to table the proposal. At that point, roughly 21 minutes into the clip, Mathewson - who told DailyMail.com that the board met privately to discuss the vote shortly before the meeting, which is against Wisconsin law - asks to speak, sparking an exchange that saw the former Kenosha alderman accuse the board of violating the state's open meetings laws. 'Thanks for allowing me to speak again,' an off-screen Mathewson can be heard saying in the footage, before leveling his suspicions at the commission. 'I just wanted to point out to those of us watching on Youtube [at] home - three members of this board of five say we're gonna table it. You know what that means right? A quorum of this board met behind closed doors today-' Before Mathewson can finish his thought, the clips shows Alderman Haugaard, said he was in favor of tabling the proposal due to an ongoing lawsuit between the city and Huber's family, frantically bang his gavel in an apparent effort to get Mathewson to stop talking. After a brief pause, Mathewson asks Haugaard, a former colleague, 'Am I lying? 'You are,' Haugaard responds, accusing Mathewson of 'misconstruing' the situation and its subsequent illegality, asserting that council member spoke 'one-on-one,' which is not against the law.  'I know you don't like it-' Mathewson begins to say in the clip, spurring Haugaard to interrupt and start shouting at the ex-alderman. 'There are open records lost sir, and what you said is false. If you have one-on-one conversations-' 'Did you talk about it or not?' Mathewson then says. 'With others on this board - yes or no?' Haugaard begins to respond: 'We talked about-' Before the city official can finish, Mathewson snipes, 'Of course you did.'  This again seemingly sets of Haugaard, who again begins shouting: 'You can talk one-on-one. You cannot ever stand here-' 'Are you gonna let me to speak?' Mathewson then asks, before Haugaard allows him to proceed. Mathewson continues: 'So, the chairman and other members of this body -three of them, which is the majority - violated the law-' Before he can get his sentence in, Haugaard again begins to bang the gavel repeatedly, with deafening intensity. 'And this guy's going nuts,' a trailed off Mathewson remarks in the clip, following Haugaard's outburst. 'Because... because you're misconstruing the law,' Haugaard stammers in the footage. Mathewson goes on to address the alderman by name, accusing Haugaard and other board members of tabling the proposal solely due to the attention it was then receiving, and urging the board to vote to reject Gittings' request. 'I understand that you're taking the coward's way out and you don't like that i'm calling you out, Eric,' Mathewson says, 'but these people you just heard, we want you to say no today. 'You want to hold it out here for a day that we're all worried about some other war, then you're going to quietly pass it - we know how you guys work. We know how the government works. 'You broke the law when you had a meeting behind closed doors with-' At this point in the footage, Mathewson is again interrupted, by another alderman who loudly called for a brief recess. 'And now you don't want to hear it,' Matthewson remarks in the footage.  'I just want people to be aware that three of you said we're tabling it.   'All five of you are gonna unanimously agree - which means you all five talked about this. You can't do that! That's a walking quorum. That's a quorum,' referring to the alleged gathering the members had prior to the official open meeting.   'You guys broke the law,' Mathewson continues. 'I know you don't want to hear it; and if you want to slam the gavel like a lunatic, doesn't change what you did is wrong. 'And if you want to be a coward and kick it down the line, that's your prerogative. 'It's not going to affect the lawsuit. They said that the police department is responsible for what Kyle did, and the jury said Kyle didn't do anything wrong,' Matthewson proceeds to point out. 'Just do the right thing, and for once stop playing political games.' Another speaker, Kenosha resident Kathy Woods echoed Mathewson's sentiments, saying, 'Of all the bone head things you guys could consider. Don't consider this.' Woods added, 'This is an insult to the people who have memorials. Who have done good things.' The initial decision regarding the proposal was upheld, and left to be discussed later date - a timetable that could span years, Matthewson told DailyMail.com. If the commission votes to move forward with the proposal, the responsibility for the upkeep would fall on Gittings.  The shooting occurred amid nights of violent protests in the city following the non-fatal shooting by police of black domestic abuser Jacob Blake.  During arguments on the issue, Huber's past criminality, including a domestic abuse charge, was brought up. It is unclear if that will ultimately sway a decision on whether to give him a memorial.   In 2018, Huber found guilty of domestic abuse and disorderly conduct. While in 2012, Huber spent time in prison following a choking incident involving his brother. Huber was fatally wounded after Rittenhouse shot him in the chest. Huber had hit Rittenhouse with a skateboard prior to being mortally wounded. In his obituary, Huber was referred as being a passionate skateboarder who was known for his 'quick wit and comedic personality.'  The skateboarder had given chase after Rittenhouse shot-and-killed another man, 36-year-old convicted pedophile Joseph Rosenbaum. Despite the killing of Huber, Gittings told The New York Post in a November 2021 interview, 'I do have a lot of sympathy for [Rittenhouse] because he is just a kid to me so it was just like a really dumbass kid who unfortunately became the figurehead for this.'  Gittings went on to lay some of the blame for Huber's death at the feet of the city of Kenosha saying, 'Kenosha also needs to be held responsible for allowing this militia to show up and do exactly what they came here to do.'",
  "c709bf4dec7169ab361ff290be8e30d005e65d51f8396a12769f7f9d": "Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned during a Thursday speech that 'large negative shocks' to the economy are inevitable as the United States continues to grapple with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and global disruptions caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Biden administration official advocated for greater safeguards against financial downturns, warning they are 'likely to continue to challenge the economy.' She explained the Great Recession after the 2008 financial crisis taught policymakers like her to correct the negative course 'as quickly as possible.'  It comes after inflation hit a 41-year high of 8.5 percent in March, according to the Labor Department. The economy's rebound from the worst of the pandemic has sent consumer prices for everything from gas, rent to groceries soaring for much of President Joe Biden's term.  March's inflation report, the most recent available, presented the full scope of the Russian invasion's impact on American consumers.  Russia's autocrat leader Vladimir Putin ordered his unprovoked attack on February 24, disrupting the precarious global food and energy supply chains.  However, any mention of inflation was notably absent from Yellen's Thursday remarks at the Brookings Institute, according to Bloomberg. She instead presented a vehement defense of the president's COVID-19 spending package, which -- along with two similar bills signed by Donald Trump -- has been blamed by some economists for over-stimulating the economy and fueling today's out-of-control inflation. 'These responses played major roles in igniting a robust recovery,' Yellen argued. She added that Biden's American Rescue Plan and Trump's packages 'played major roles in igniting a robust recovery' in 2021 as public health restrictions were beginning to lift and vaccines were becoming available.  However, inflation outpacing record gains in wages and job growth means Biden's critics and Republican lawmakers have still been able to use the consumer price spike as a political cudgel.  But on Thursday, Yellen claimed the steps were necessary in a time of sheer 'uncertainty.' 'Throughout 2020, and into 2021, the path of the pandemic, including its severity and the role of future viral strains could not be predicted,' she said. Failure to support the economy adequately, Yellen said, could have brought 'a downturn that could match the Great Depression.'  She called for countries to establish 'recession remedies' to prevent what she predicted are virtually certain future economic spirals. 'Improved understanding of breaks in supply chains, increases in commodity prices, bursting of asset bubbles, and labor and productivity shocks can help policymakers implement reforms that bolster our economic resilience,' Yellen said. The Treasury chief also held up Biden's electric vehicles and clean energy production push as another way to cushion future market downturns. Biden's administration has been under fire by Republicans for refusing to lease new oil and gas drilling permits to mitigate soaring gas prices. Russia's disruption of supply lines and the president's import ban on Moscow's energy have contributed to fuel prices rising above $6 per gallon in parts of the country last month. As of Thursday the average price at the pump still exceeds $5 in California and Nevada. But Yellen said Biden's push for green fuel as a way to reach energy independence 'will mitigate our future vulnerability to oil price shocks.'  'At the same time, they will abet the transition to cleaner energy sources which will, in due course, lessen the risks tied to natural disasters and climate change,' she explained. She delivered the remarks just hours after it was revealed the U.S. economy had shrunk in the first quarter of 2022. The country's gross domestic product (GDP), a broad measure of the economy's health, fell by 1.4 percent in the period of January through March, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. It's the worst economic showing since U.S. markets were plunged into chaos by the pandemic in the second quarter of 2020. The last quarter of 2021, by contrast, saw a record 6.9 percent growth pace.

Aspiring lawyer Sven Badzak, 22, was set upon by up to six youths as he was walking along Willesden Lane, Kilburn, north west London, with his 16-year-old friend. Mr Badzak and the teenager were getting orange juice before going to a bagel shop before they were chased at around 5.30pm on 6 February 2021 and got separated in the pursuit. The attackers caught up with Mr Badzak and he was knifed repeatedly. He was later pronounced dead at the scene. His 17-year-old friend, who cannot be named, also suffered multiple stab injuries but managed to escape into a shop in Willesden Lane. Rashid Gedel and Shiroh Ambersley, both 21, and a 17-year-old appeared at the Old Bailey on Thursday via video-link from HMP Belmarsh, charged with murdering Mr Badzak. They sat next to eachother in a prison conference room all wearing face masks as the Recorder of London, Judge Mark Lucraft, confirmed they will stand trial on 18 July. Gedel, Ambersley and the 17-year-old denied murdering Mr Badzak and attempting to murder his friend at an earlier hearing. Anthony Orchard, QC, prosecuting, earlier, said it was clear Mr Badzak was a victim of mistaken identity. 'Sven Badzak was pronounced life extinct at 6.28pm that evening,' he said. 'Neither victim was a gang member or associate. They were victims of mistaken identity.' Sven's mother, former Conservative Party activist Jasna Badzak, said her son had gone to a shop to get orange juice and then to the bagel shop when he was attacked. Sven was privately educated in London at Wetherby and Portland Place schools before attending Roehampton University. Gedel, Ambersley and the 17-year-old were all remanded in custody ahead of the trial.",

Marcos Ponce, 48, was coming home from a vacation last month with his family and friends in Ushuaia, a resort town on the southernmost tip of South America, when they decided to stop to snorkel in the Santa Cruz province's the Lake of the Desert. The lawyer told digital news outlet Infobae that he was joined by his best friend Hugo Bottaro and spent nearly 50 minutes underwater, but as they were ready to return to shore, he decided to continue ahead and snap some additional photos. As he focused his camera, Ponce was bothered by a shiny object lying next to the wooden column of a dock that prevented him from getting a quality picture.  He swam towards the dock and grabbed the object without knowing what it really was. When he surfaced, he discovered that it was an 18-karat gold ring. He figured it was a wedding or engagement ring and that someone had accidentally dropped it in the lake. Ponce, who has been going on diving excursions for 20 years, kept the ring at home and on Sunday thought it was perfect time to find its rightful owner. He took to his social media networks and posted photos of the ring on Facebook and Instagram. The post was shared thousands of times and had hundreds of comments in the first two hours. An hour later, a woman from the Santa Cruz town of Rio Turbio direct messaged Ponce to claim the ring. The owner of the ring - whose name has been withheld by Ponce to maintain her privacy - was able to confirm the engraved date - March 21, 2015 - in the inside part of the ring along with her former girlfriend's last name, D'Amico. It represented the date she and her ex-partner had gotten engaged. The woman told Ponce that she had moved to Buenos Aires after accepting her partner's proposal and then kept the 18-karat gold ring after they mutually agreed to go different ways over a year ago.  She eventually returned to Rio Turbio and while visiting the lake in January decided it was finally time to get rid of the ring and tossed it in the Lake of the Desert. 'She admitted that she always thought about getting rid of the ring, but that she wanted to do it in a special way and that's how this summer she traveled to the Lake of the Desert and threw it into its waters,' Ponce said. Ponce also got a message from the woman's ex-girlfriend, who was able to confirm the same details. However, he decided he will be mailing it out to D'Amico instead this week. 'If fate brings this ring back to me, she'll come back somehow,' D'Amico told Ponce.",
  "b14568d0a2a14f1c938c83d60bf6e52f34eb2c61b69bf5efb2b5f9d2": "Paul Auster's son Daniel died in the hospital on Tuesday six days after being found unconscious having overdosed on drugs on a Brooklyn subway station platform.  NYPD officials on Thursday confirmed that he was found at 9.48am on the northbound G platform at the Clinton Street subway in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn.  He was taken to the hospital but died on Tuesday.   It brings a sad end to a tragic saga that began when his ten-month-old daughter Ruby died in November.  She had ingested fentanyl while her father took a nap in their Park Slope apartment. He found her blue and unresponsive after waking up.  Daniel told police at the time that he'd just injected heroin when the pair lay down to sleep.  His wife, Zuzan Smith, told police she trusted him with their daughter.  It's unclear what happened in the following six months but on April 16, Daniel was charged with his daughter's death.  He was released on bond on April 17 by Brooklyn Judge John Hecht, who demanded a $100,000 cash bail or $250,000 bond. It's unclear who met those bond requirements.  On April 20 - four days after his arrest - he overdosed in the subway station.  Ruby's mother, Zuzan Smith, has not commented on his death, nor has the Brooklyn District Attorney whose office let him go free.  A DA office spokesman on Thursday would only confirm that they had been informed of his death on Tuesday and that it brought an end to the case. It is unclear if he was living with Zuzan when he died, or if the pair were separated.  'On Wednesday, April 20,2022 at 0948hrs at Washington Avenue/Clinton Street subway station, police officers observed an unconscious 44-year-old male on the northbound G train platform, administered CPR along with FDNY and the individual was removed by EMS to Brooklyn Hospital in stable condition but was later pronounced deceased on Tuesday, April 26,2022,' an NYPD spokesman said on Thursday.  The New York Post first reported Daniel's death.  Daniel's father, Paul Auster, 75, has won numerous international awards for his books, which include titles such as The New York Trilogy,' 'The Book of Illusions,' and 'Moon Palace.' In 2017, he was nominated for the Booker Prize for his novel '4, 3, 2, 1', and his work has been translated into more than forty languages. In Auster's 1995 film about the lives of people who frequented a Brooklyn tobacco shop, Smoke - which starred Harvey Keitel and William Hurt - Daniel played the role of a book thief.  His mother is author and translator Lydia Davis, 74.  Davis and Paul Auster divorced in 1978; in 1982, he remarried, tying the knot with author Siri Hustvedt, and the couple have one daughter together, musician Sophie Auster, 34. A woman believed to be Siri was seen leaving the couple's Park Slope home on Thursday.  No one from the family has commented on Ruby's death, Daniel's arrest or his death earlier this week.  During his teenage years, Auster started going to clubs in New York City and became heavily involved with drugs, according to The New Yorker. At the age of 18, in 1996, Auster was present in the apartment when a drug dealer, Andre 'Angel' Melendez, was murdered by 'Club Kid Killer' Michael Alig, a former nightclub promoter, and his roommate, Robert Riggs.  Auster was given $3,000 of Melendez's money in exchange for his silence. He later pleaded guilty to possession of stolen property and was given five years probation.  Auster had a string of arrests including several drug possession charges in 2008 and 2010.  In 2009 he was charged with petit larceny and possession of stolen property.  Auster in April claimed his baby daughter died of a fentanyl overdose after he took heroin then went to take a nap with the child by his side while his wife worked, a court heard.  The vivid account allegedly given to the NYPD by Auster was shared by Assistant District Attorney Tien Tran at his arraignment hearing on manslaughter charges. The infant's mother, Zuzan Smith, told police that their daughter, Ruby, was awake and alert when she left her in Auster's care and went to work. A criminal complaint obtained by DailyMail.com states that Auster told police that shortly after Smith left their home, he injected heroin and then got into bed for a nap with the child by his side.  When he woke up from his nap, she was 'blue, lifeless and unresponsive', the complaint states.  The prosecutor said that the girl had enough drugs in her system to 'render an adult unconscious.'  It's still unclear how the girl ingested the drugs, but Auster confessed that he kept heroin in his bathroom.  At the time his lawyer, James Godfrey, told The New York Times that he was recently sober and was in drug treatment. 'This case is painfully tragic, and Mr Auster remains devastated over the loss of his beloved daughter Ruby,' the lawyer told the paper. 'Substance use disorder is an issue that countless families reel from each year, and we caution the public to refrain from making any rush to judgment.'  An autopsy conducted by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner a few days later found Ruby died of acute intoxication caused by the combined effects of fentanyl and heroin.  Auster, who worked as a landscaper, posted photos of his child and Smith on his Instagram page before jetting off to Mexico and Columbia in January. On his travels, he seemed to be backpacking like a college student, and taking in several raves. Auster and his father appeared to be estranged, but Auster wrote Daniel into his work. In his 2004 novel, Oracle Night, the book is narrated by a writer called Trause whose son is a drug addict who terrorizes his stepmother. During a 2006 Guardian interview, Paul Auster's second wife Siri Hustvedt who is also a writer, declined to speak about her stepson.    'Yes. You know, I'm not going to talk about any of that, no. No,' she said, her eyes reportedly beginning to water.  'You know, I am married to a writer, and this - writing - is an odd enterprise.  'It's something we both support very strongly.  'I've always been behind Paul, and he's always been behind me.  'I have a very strong family.' ",
  "f732355650853a0071a910345333c336a742d439e07a8a36008d2d9b": "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said Thursday that she'd like to invite Elon Musk to Capitol Hill after his Twitter takeover - and would assemble a group of 'brilliant' people banned from the network to have a conversation with him. 'I don't know Mr. Musk, but I do invite him to come talk with me in Washington, D.C. I would be happy to put together a roundtable of all the most brilliant people who have been unjustly banned from Twitter and he can see for himself the urgent necessity of doing right by them,' Greene told reporters at a press conference outside the Capitol. 'Which we all hope he will as he has stated he believes in free speech.  Greene said to the crowd: 'We don't need to be told what we can and can't say online by nutcases in San Francisco or other places.' She told DailyMail.com she hasn't officially made the ask to Musk, but did name some of her ideal attendees.  'There would be a lot of people I'd love to invite to this roundtable. I see someone standing behind you right there - Milo Yiannopoulus - I think he'd be a great person to have there,' she said.  Yiannopoulos was banned from Twitter in 2016 over his engagement in the racist and targeted abuse of comedian Leslie Jones, who is black.  'Alex Jones would be another person,' Greene went on.  Jones was banned from Twitter in 2018, with the company saying he engaged in 'abusive behavior.'  He's widely known as a right-wing conspiracy theorist.   'We'll put together a great list of people who have been just almost deleted from public life due to this type of censorhip and I think Elon Musk will enjoy talking to them,' Greene said.  Greene's personal Twitter account got suspended in January after she repeatedly posted content that violated the company's policy on COVID-19 misinformation.  She still has access to her Congressional account.   Greene told reporters Thursday she wanted her personal Twitter account reinstated.  'On my Congressional Twitter account, for all of us here, we're not allowed to talk about our campaigns or ask for money, say, to defend ourselves in court from political attacks and things like that. So it's important to me to have my personal Twitter account,' she explained.  'I am cautiously optimistic about the prospects for Twitter now that Elon Musk has taken over,' she also said. Greene's main reason for hosting a press conference was to tout legislation - the 21st Century Free Speech Act - that she's introducing alongside Sen. Bill Hagerty, who's sponsoring the same bill in the upper chamber.  The bill would scrap Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act and replace it with 'reasonable, non-discriminatory access to online communications platforms' that would treat so-called Big Tech as a 'common carrier,' similar to an airline or FedEx, Greene said.  Greene said that illegal activity like child trafficking would remain unlawful - but suggested it would make it more difficult for tech companies to patrol misinformation.  'I don't believe in this whole misinformation thing that the Democrats are wanting to push on people,' she said, adding that it was 'their term for silencing free speech.'  'For example, parents' ability to say I want to protect my daughters in their bathrooms and in their sports - that can be considered hate speech or misinformation, or people's ability to say - I don't want the government forcing me to take a vaccine,' Greene said. 'I'd like to have full control over my own health and choose if I would like to use my own natural immunity against the biological weapon of COVID-19.' 'People that said things like that were permanently banned on social media,' she noted. She said that anti-trans and anti-vax opinions weren't 'misinformation.'  'That's people expressing their own views, their own opinions and that's their freedom of speech and they have the right to make those decisions and Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, no other big tech company has the right to remove them for saying things like that,' Greene said.

  "b0c08dbef7d81a8242f371c29ea5a88f9e14a7d77ecf5bb98f296dbe": "Boris Becker was today spotted visiting Harrods, a Notting Hill council estate and seeing his son on what could be his last day of freedom before he faces up to seven years in prison after concealing hundreds of thousands of pounds following his bankruptcy.  The prospect of jail appeared to weigh heavy on the former tennis star, who looked haggard as he walked alone through areas of London wearing a grey jacket, jeans, trainers and a baseball cap.  The three-time Wimbledon champion, 54, was seen going into a side entrance of the Harrods department store in Knightsbridge, while he was also photographed today in the Paddington and Notting Hill areas. It is unclear if he bought anything at the department   At around 11am, he visited a flat in Notting Hill, where a woman answered the door and embraced him. He later left the flat at 12.45pm. It is unclear who Becker was visiting at the council estate.   The former tennis star was also seen meeting with his son ahead of his sentencing tomorrow.   Yesterday, he was seen being hugged by his girlfriend Lilian de Carvalho Monteiro after spending 'family time' with his son and estranged wife Lilly Becker days earlier.  The German star-turned-commentator was found guilty of four charges under the Insolvency Act in a trial this month.  A London court heard he transferred PS350,000 to other accounts, hid a property in Germany and failed to declare 75,000 shares in an IT firm and a PS700,000 loan.  The father-of-four was legally obliged to disclose all his assets after being declared bankrupt in 2017. The London-based former world number one now faces losing lucrative contracts with TV networks around the world, including his job as a BBC pundit at Wimbledon.  Yesterday Becker, who won tennis fans' hearts in the 1980s with his all-action style of play, was embraced by his girlfriend as he smoked during a break in a meeting with documentary maker George Chignell in London. Last weekend, he was pictured with Lilly and their 12-year-old boy in south London before the father and son met up with his current girlfriend. Becker will learn his fate at Southwark Crown Court tomorrow morning.  Becker's mother Elvira Becker, 86, has begged a judge not to send her son to jail, saying earlier this month that he is 'a decent boy overall', adding: 'I hope my son doesn't have to go to prison.'  During his trial, Becker told a jury how his PS38 million career earnings were swallowed up by an expensive divorce to his first wife Barbara Becker, child maintenance payments and 'expensive lifestyle commitments'. The six-time Grand Slam champion said he was 'shocked' and 'embarrassed' when he was declared bankrupt on June 21 2017 over an unpaid loan of more than PS3million on his estate in Mallorca, Spain. The German national, who has lived in the UK since 2012, claimed he had co-operated with trustees tasked with securing his assets, even offering up his wedding ring, and relied on the advisers who managed his life. However, Becker, who was supported in court by his partner Ms de Carvalho Monteiro and eldest son, was found guilty of four charges under the Insolvency Act by a jury at Southwark Crown Court on April 8. They include removal of property, two counts of failing to disclose estate and concealing debt. Judge Deborah Taylor released Becker on conditional bail ahead of sentencing tomorrow, when he could face a jail sentence carrying a maximum term of seven years on each count. The jury heard Becker received PS950,000 from the sale of a Mercedes car dealership he owned in Germany, which was paid into a business account. Prosecutor Rebecca Chalkley said he used the account as a 'piggy bank' for personal expenses, including PS7,600 on children's school fees, almost PS1,000 at Harrods, and payments made to Ralph Lauren, Porsche, Ocado and a Chelsea children's club. He was found guilty of transferring PS356,000 to nine recipients, including the accounts of his ex-wife Barbara and estranged wife Sharlely 'Lilly' Becker, the mother of his fourth child. Becker also paid PS40,000 for an ankle operation at a private clinic and spent PS5,000 at a luxury golf resort in China, the court heard. He was also convicted of failing to declare a property in his home town of Leimen, hiding an PS700,000 bank loan on the house as well as 75,000 shares in tech firm Breaking Data Corp. But Becker was acquitted of a further 20 charges, including nine counts of failing to hand over trophies and medals from his tennis career. He told jurors he did not know the whereabouts of the memorabilia, including two of his three Wimbledon men's singles trophies, including the 1985 title that catapulted him to stardom, aged 17. The other prizes were his 1992 Olympic gold medal, Australian Open trophies from 1991 and 1996, the President's Cup from 1985 and 1989, his 1989 Davis Cup trophy and a Davis Cup gold coin which he won in 1988. Becker was cleared of failing to declare a second German property, as well as his interest in the PS2.5 million Chelsea flat occupied by his daughter Anna Ermakova, who was conceived during Becker's infamous sexual encounter with waitress Angela Ermakova at London restaurant Nobu in 1999. Giving evidence, he said he earned a 'vast amount' of money during his career, paying cash for a family home in Munich, a property in Miami, Florida, and the estate in Mallorca, which was worth about 50 million euros at the height of the property market. But Becker, who went on to coach current world number one tennis player Novak Djokovic, work as a TV sports commentator and act as a brand ambassador for firms including Puma, said his income 'reduced dramatically' following his retirement in 1999. He said he was involved in an 'expensive divorce' with ex-wife Barbara in 2001, involving high maintenance payments to their two sons, and had to support his daughter Anna and her mother, in a deal which included the Chelsea flat. Becker, who was resident in Monte Carlo and Switzerland before moving to the UK, said he had 'expensive lifestyle commitments,' including his PS22,000-a-month rented house in Wimbledon, south-west London. He also owed the Swiss authorities five million francs (about PS4 million) and separately just under one million euros (more than PS800,000) in liabilities over a conviction for tax evasion and attempted tax evasion in Germany in 2002. The court heard Becker's bankruptcy resulted from a PS3.85 million loan from private bank Arbuthnot Latham in 2013, and PS1.2million, with a 25 per cent interest rate, borrowed from British businessman John Caudwell, who founded Phones 4u, the following year. He said bad publicity had damaged 'brand Becker', meaning he struggled to make enough money to pay off his debts, while his QC Jonathan Laidlaw said at the time of his bankruptcy Becker was too 'trusting and reliant' on his advisers. Few spots stars have ever hit the height of Boris Becker's tennis careers - and none as young as the German ace. Born in Leimen, West Germany, in 1967, Becker, the son of an architect father and a Czech immigrant mother, was thrust into the world of tennis from a young age. His father founded a tennis centre in the town, where Becker honed his skills early on. By the age of 10, in 1977, he was a member of the junior team of the Baden Tennis Association. He went on to win the South German championship and the first German Youth Tennis Tournament.  After winning funding for training from the German Tennis Federation, he turned professional at 16 in 1984, winning the Tennis World Young Masters at the NEC in Birmingham in 1985, before claiming victory at Queens in June. Two weeks later, in July, aged 17, he entered Wimbledon as an unseeded player and took the tournament by storm, beating Kevin Curren by four sets in the final.  At just 17 years and 228 days old he became the youngest men's singles champion at SW19 - and immediately became a household name. The following year he defend his title, beating then world number one Ivan Lendl to secure back-to-back Wimbledon titles. He appeared in 77 finals and won 49 singles titles during his 16 years as a tennis pro. But by 1993, facing criticism over his marriage to wife Barbara and tax problems with the German government, had caused Becker to slide into a severe mid-career decline. In 1997, Becker lost to Sampras in the quarterfinals at Wimbledon. After that match, he vowed that he would never play at Wimbledon again. However he returned one more time to the prestigious west London tennis club, in 1999, this time losing in the fourth round to Patrick Rafter. Off the court, his personal troubles continued. He had to pay PS2.4million after he fathered a daughter, named Anna, with a Russian model while married to wife Barbara. That incident took place after he crashed out of Wimbledon to Rafter in 1999 and decided to retire from the sport, aged 31. Becker, in his 2003 autobiography, Stay A Moment Longer, revealed how he 'cried my eyes out' and felt the need to go out for a few beers with friends. However his then wife Barbara, seven months' pregnant with their second son, wanted him to stay at their hotel with her.  'She couldn't and wouldn't understand that she suddenly wasn't first in my priorities,' said Becker.  'I said, 'Just once more with the lads, Barbara, just once more to say farewell and then it's only you'. That didn't work. We rowed for two whole hours. Suddenly she was in pain and decided to check into hospital.; Becker said he told his wife to call him if the baby was really on the way, then hit the town. By 11pm he was at the bar in Mayfair's Nobu and spotted Russian model Angela Ermakowa. The pair had sex on the staircase in the London outpost.  The following February his secretary handed him a fax in his Munich office. It read: 'Dear Herr Becker, We met in Nobu in London. The result of that meeting is now eight months old.'  He later split from his first wife Barbara Feltus, a divorce which is estimated to have cost him more than PS15million, as well as their home in Miami.  Becker found a new post-tennis purpose soon after, joining the BBC for its annual coverage of Wimbledon - to great success. But his personal problems continued. He had a short engagement to Alessandra Meyer-Wolden in 2008, before announcing that he and Dutch model Sharlely 'Lilly' Kerssenberg would marry in 2009. After nine years of marriage, and a child, Becker's fourth, the pair split in 2018.  A year earlier, Becker had been declared bankrupt in June 2017 over an unpaid loan of more than PS3million on his estate in Mallorca, Spain. His former business partner, Hans-Dieter Cleven, also claimed that the former tennis ace owed him more than PS30million - though the case that was rejected by a Swiss court. Now Becker faces another bump in the road - perhaps the most serious yet - after being found guilty of four counts relating to the Insolvency Act earlier this month. He faces up to seven years in prison - with his freedom now left hanging in the balance ahead of his sentencing tomorrow.",
  "6d8778fad1ddeaace1c5c5e637bef546cb53b5ce5c702d817ab8a157": "A British Hollywood actress accused of sexually abusing a schoolgirl with her taekwondo 'master' husband vowed to burn their alleged victim's belongings when she said she no longer wanted to see the couple, a court heard today. Martial arts expert Zara Phythian, 36, from Mansfield, who starred in Marvel's Doctor Strange with Benedict Cumberbatch, is on trial accused of 14 charges of sexual activity with a child with her spouse Victor Marke, 59.  The couple arrived at Nottingham Crown Court today for the second day of their trial, where their alleged victim gave evidence for the first time. She claims they groomed her as a 13-year-old girl and filmed themselves abusing her after plying the victim with dark rum. The woman, who was a child at the time of the alleged offences, said that she finally told a friend 'her darkest secret' about the abuse when she was 18, and had later spoken to Zara on the phone, telling jurors: 'I said I am not coming back. Zara said: 'Don't come back, I'm burning all your stuff'.' Phythian, who starred in the 2016 Marvel film viewed as Cumberbatch's blockbuster breakthrough, is alleged to have targeted the teenager with Marke. The couple filmed most of the abuse in bid to recreate their favourite porn scenes, the prosecution say. The attacks are claimed to have happened between 2005 and 2008. Today their alleged victim tearfully told the trial how she finally revealed what she described as her 'darkest secret' years later when a police officer knocked on her mum's door to say another girl had claimed Marke had abused her, and asked 'if she knew anything'. At that time, the court has heard how Taekwondo black belt Zara was enjoying 'unprecedented personal and professional success' thanks to her acting career, including the role of 'Brunette Zealot' in Doctor Strange. Speaking from behind a screen, the girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she 'would never have come forward' and planned to 'die with my shame' - but had recently become a mother herself, and felt she had 'no option to speak my truth' in a bid to stop anyone else being targeted in the same way she claimed to have been.  'That was my deepest, darkest secret. I thought that if I was to say anything, then my family would hate me. At that time I really hated my mum. I got stuck because I had this secret and I could not tell her.' In an earlier videotaped interview played to the jury that the alleged victim gave to police, she told how the Markes 'preyed' upon her. She said: 'They saw the vulnerability in me and preyed on that, and saw my mum was struggling, and took advantage of that. I found it quite hard and they kind of instructed me through all of it (the sexual activity).' Referring to the alleged filming of the incidents, she added: 'All I can remember is he used to record. 'I don't know what he did with them. I never saw them again. I did not want to see them. I was ashamed. It was a power they had over me. 'I never knew how to get out of that situation. I could not see a way out.' The alleged victim went on to claim the Markes had 'made me leave college six months in', adding: 'They really ruined my education in a sense'. The court has previously heard Victor's marriage broke down around 2005 after he had an affair with Zara, who was herself a teenager at the time. He is also charged with four further allegations, all denied, of indecent assault on another teenage girl between 2002 and 2003. Nottingham Crown Court heard that alongside Phythian's acting career, the couple were sports coaches who 'commanded admiration and respect within the martial arts world'.  But prosecutor Ahmed Hossain QC said Marke, a taekwondo 'master', used his position of trust to 'satisfy his sexual urges' in targeting the girl - with his wife acting 'as part of that process'. The child also felt like she was being 'coached' by Phythian during the abuse, the court was told. Jurors were told that on the first occasion the victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was plied with rum at the couple's home before being 'dared' by Zara, 36, to perform a sex act on Victor after showing her how. After that, it was claimed the Marke abused the girl 'once or twice a month' for the next three years, and urged her 'not to tell anyone'.  Marke is also charged with four further allegations, all denied, of indecent assault on another teenage girl between 2002 and 2003.  Marke, 59, and Phythian, 36, - whose legal name is now Zara Marke - deny 14 charges of sexual activity with a child.  As well as being cast in Hollywood hit Doctor Strange as the character Brunette Zealot, the actress has also appeared in a string of other films under her stage name Zara Phythian, with her latest action movie Accident Man 2 due out this year.  Jurors were shown a video interview their alleged victim gave to police. In it, she described how she would stay at the Markes' then home in Arnold, Nottingham, where the pair would 'let her drink', even though she was just 13. It was there, she said, that the abuse began. She told officers: 'It was Captain Morgan's Dark Rum. My mum did not like me drinking. I was not allowed to drink. 'Zara asked me if I wanted to play a game of 'dare', and started [performing a sex act on] Victor. She asked me to do the same. 'Then he took it in turns to have sex with each of us. 'I just tried to copy Zara's reactions and emotions, the noises she was making. I had never received much attention from boys. I think I just liked the attention. It just went on from there.' The alleged victim, now in her late 20s, claimed the sexual activity continued 'once or twice a month' until she was 16 - with Victor Marke, 59, asking her to record him and his wife on some occasions, and filming her on others. She added: 'I knew it was wrong, but I did not know how to get out of the situation, or say anything. 'I just did whatever they asked me to do. They made it seem like I was some naughty kid and they were helping me out. I just felt like there was no way out. They told me not to say anything.' She estimated Marke, a coach in martial arts and Taekwondo at a very high level, had sex with her about 20 times on different occasions.   Phythian, who portrayed Brunette Zealot in the Marvel film, was 'at the height of her success,' said barrister, Francis McGrath, who is representing Marke, the film star's husband.  Mr McGrath made reference to Phythian's climb to fame as he cross-examined the woman who has claimed Marke repeatedly indecently assaulted her as a teenager. He said: 'Throughout 2016, you would be aware from national media and social media posts, she (Zara Marke) was enjoying unprecedented personal and professional success in a motion picture starring Benedict Cumberbatch.  'On December 4, 2016, at the height of her success, you made a complaint'. This led to a police video recording of her allegations two days later.  The woman told the court, 'they are not linked' - when it was suggested she went to police after 'Zara Phythian' - someone from her youth - was experiencing the unprecedented success referred to. The woman had told police she was groomed and sexually touched by Marke of Ravenshead. After she turned 16, he is alleged to have had sex with her. The victim said she decided it was the responsible thing to make a disclosure to police due to the job she was in.  She told the court she was dealing with two safeguarding cases at work, 'matters which were very tough to deal with and, me personally, was taking a toll on'.  After she felt she could not cope with 'not saying anything anymore', she decided to say something. The jury later heard claims that Zara had an intimate tattoo on her body. The victim told the court it was an 'Oriental symbol' that she believed meant 'paradise', adding: 'That's what she said to me.' James Varley QC, defending Zara, also said that the actress had been offered a role performing with Britain's Got Talent winners Diversity on their UK dance tour in 2010 - but was forced to turn it down because she was 'defending a (martial arts) world title in India'. He added: 'By this stage, Zara had become quite well known in the martial arts community. 'She had won two World Records for kicking stuff off people's heads, had done film stuff, and had won World Championships, and it was because of her fame in that community that she was invited to perform something martial-artsy in Diversity's Show. 'She is developing a media career.'  Marke faces four allegations, all denied, of historic indecent assault on another woman who was 15 at the time between 2002 and 2003.  He is also jointly charged with his wife, Phythian, of 14 denied allegations of sexual activity with a different woman who was a girl at the time. The trial continues.",
  "a17eeacd510cc197f847e1a1f38138f2e7d2ae193ff0941ab6183352": "A Labour frontbencher told a woman MP that they were a 'secret weapon' because men wanted to sleep with them, it was claimed today. The female politician - who wants to remain anonymous - was allegedly subjected to the lewd remark at an event in Westminster. The episode surfaced as claims that a Tory MP was seen watching porn on their phone in the Commons were referred for an independent investigation.   Cabinet members said the culprit should be stripped of the whip or even kicked out of the House if they the allegations are proven.  But former minister Caroline Nokes has accused the chief whip of kicking the issue 'into the long grass', and said the whip should have been suspended already.   Defence Secretary Ben Wallace also urged MPs to stay out of Parliament's 'poisonous' drinking dens amid growing uproar at sexism and sleaze at Westminster. Mr Wallace said the long hours and access to alcohol had been a problem for many years, and his advice to colleagues was 'finish your day's work and go home'. In the latest grim claims, a woman MP told BBC Wales that when someone praised her as a 'rising star' of her party at an event, the unnamed shadow cabinet minister intervened.  They apparently said she was a 'secret weapon' because 'women want to be her friend' and men wanted to sleep with her. 'She is a vote winner,' they reportedly added. Keir Starmer said: 'I'm deeply concerned to hear these suggestions and these allegations. 'There is a complaints procedure and I want everybody to have the confidence to use that complaints procedure because I would want to get to the bottom of this and do something about it.' A Labour spokeswoman said: 'The Labour Party takes all complaints extremely seriously.  'They are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures, and any appropriate action is taken.' It is understood that no complaint has been received, and BBC Wales said the woman did not want to be identified for fear of consequences.  Labour has recently introduced a new independent complaints procedure to boost confidence, and is encouraging people to come forward. In a round of interviews this morning, Mr Wallace said 'there's no place for pornography in any workplace' and said there needs to be a cultural change in Westminster. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I certainly think they should lose the whip.' He pointed to the handful of exclusive bars on the Parliamentary estate, where drinks are much cheaper than outside, with a pint of beer costing around PS3.60. Mr Wallace told Times Radio that there were 'fights', 'sexist comments' and 'propositions' in the bars.  'What I have witnessed is, what I think is the fundamental problem of Westminster, is the overall culture is that hundreds and hundreds of people (are) working long hours in a place with bars,' he said. 'And for some people, under lots of pressure for all sorts of reasons. And that... mix becomes poisonous.'  Mr Wallace said the problems had been 'going on for decades' and were 'not easy to fix'.  'I mean, my advice to any MP is actually avoid the bars, you know, finish a day's work and go home.  'But you know, that is part of the ultimate challenge around parliament that I think needs to be fixed.  'And you know, in the Armed Forces, I have a similar challenge, which is often in those high pressure environments where people mix and then alcohol is consumed, you end up in a place where people do things, either they regret, or things that is totally unacceptable.'  The Defence Secretary told Sky News: 'There is a range of allegations that go right across the House, go right across the parties. 'This is a problem, I think, about the overall culture of the House of Commons. 'It is late sitting, long nights with bars, and that very often leads, and it has done for decades, to behavioural challenges... 'I think it's really important that we think about ways to change the culture in the House of Commons.' Attorney General Suella Braverman told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour that if the allegation of an MP watching porn in Parliament is proven there should be a 'severe reprimand' including an opportunity to oust them from the Commons. 'I'm shocked and appalled... what would possess them? It is totally unacceptable,' she said. 'I am very glad that the chief whip has now referred it to the independent complaints and grievance process.' Ms Braverman went on: 'I think we would really need to see a situation where the whip would be removed. I am ashamed that this person is carrying the Conservative rosette. 'I think they really do need to be subject to a recall, and no longer holding their privileged position as a member of parliament.' Ms Braverman said while all the men she had worked with were 'respectful' there were MPs who behaved like 'animals'.  'There is however, a very small minority of men - and it is men - who fall short, and there are some bad apples who are out of order, who behave like animals and are bringing parliament into disrepute to be honest,' she said. 'I don't think we should be saying there is a pervasive culture. That is not my experience. There are certain individuals who are behaving in an unacceptable way.'   The Conservative Party's chief whip has ordered an official investigation into claims that an MP was watching porn on his mobile phone in the House of Commons Chamber. A spokesman said the matter would be referred to Parliament's independent complaints and grievance scheme (ICGS). 'Following allegations of inappropriate behaviour in the House of Commons the Chief Whip has asked that this matter be referred to the ICGS. 'Upon the conclusion of any ICGS investigation the Chief Whip will take appropriate action.'  Ms Nokes told PoliticsHome the referral amounted to 'kicking it into the long grass' and it would be 'months before anything is done'. 'It's not shouldering the burden of responsibility of dealing with it, and I think the Chiefs should have dealt with it immediately,' she said.  Sir Keir said the Conservative Party should 'take action now' against the MP. He said: 'I think it's very good that we've got an independent system and obviously that requires anonymity. 'This is an unusual case because the Tory Party knows who this individual is. 'I think that they should deal with it and deal with it sooner rather than later and take appropriate action. 'So, nothing wrong with the independent process, but I think the Tory Party, they know who this is, they should take action now.' Those reported to the body are given automatic anonymity, meaning the Tory MP's name will not be published while he is under investigation. Only witnesses are able to make complaints to the scheme. The body is said to be investigating at least 56 MPs - including three ministers and two shadow ministers - who have been accused of sexual misconduct. Two female MPs say they witnessed their colleague looking at adult images more than once.",
  "726264879fe82ff0406d0729fcf44bb1cb7599d1d8f2a18577b732cd": "Students at Durham University have been told to attend 'anti-racism training' after a row over journalist Rod Liddle.  The training is aimed at 'ensuring a safer community for people of colour'. But students have branded it 'anti-white indoctrination', 'divisive' and are refusing to attend as it clashes with exam revision.  It comes after Liddle, the controversial Spectator journalist, was invited to give a talk at South College, sparking protests from students who claimed he was 'racist'.  An email sent on Tuesday to undergraduates at John Snow College said training would be run by Durham's People of Colour Association (DPOCA), a student body, and would be 'mandatory'.  But after being contacted by the Daily Mail, the university said it was 'not a University or College initiative' and was 'at the discretion of individuals'. Rod Liddle's speech at the University of Durham has not been reported in full, but the contents of the speech have been reported by the university's student newspaper, the Palatinate. According to the newspaper, Liddle opened his Friday speech saying he was disappointed not to see any sex workers at the event. This was in reference to recent controversy surrounding safety training provided by Durham University to student sex workers.  Liddle then claimed that the left was going against 'science or pure facts,' saying 'a person with an X and a Y chromosome, that has a long, dangling penis, is scientifically a man, and that is pretty much, scientifically, the end of the story', according to the paper. He continued, on a different topic, saying: 'It is fairly easily proven that colonialism is not remotely the major cause of Africa's problems, just as it is very easy to prove that the educational underachievement of British people of Caribbean descent or African Americans is nothing to do with institutional or structural racism'.  Liddle also opined about the UK's forced adoption policy between 1945 and 1975. He said that attitudes now put woman, not children, first, adding that anger about the policy did not take into account the child's mental health and economic situation enough. He closed his speech with a message to the event's attendees about the importance of listening to, and doubting other people's opinions. The Palatinate reported that a dozen students walked out before the speech began, and several more during it. At the end, a very small number are reported to have applauded the speaker, and while it is protocol to rise for the high table as it leaves, nearly all students remaining in the hall stayed seated. Some shouted 'disgusting' and 'racist' at Liddle as he left the room.  It is understood students were vowing not to attend the sessions. Samantha Smith, a Durham student, said on Twitter: 'As a mixed race student, I refuse to take part in this anti-white indoctrination'.  Another called it 'divisive' and said 'students should be revising for exams instead'.  A DPOCA spokesman said: 'The intention of the workshop is to create a more inclusive, not divisive, culture on campus.'  A Durham University spokesman said: 'The provision of this training was not a University or College initiative, but was taken by the student-led JCR at John Snow College. 'The training is delivered by DPOCA, an association of Durham Students' Union. 'Anti-racism training can help to create a more respectful environment, but attendance is at the discretion of individual students.' DPOCA has in the past run events such as 'decolonise hiking', a walk around Durham for 'students of colour'. It has also been campaigning to 'decolonise the curriculum' and has promoted online the 'County Durham Palestine Solidarity Campaign'. College head Tim Luckhurst, who had invited Liddle, was temporarily barred from duties while an 'investigation' took place into his conduct. He was allowed to keep his job, but the university vowed to be more 'inclusive' and effect a 'culture change' following the incident. Footage emerged after Liddle's talk of Professor Luckhurst and his wife Dorothy Luckhurst talking to students in a bid to calm them down. They appeared to be helping them understand universities are supposed to be bastions of free speech. The youths stood with their mouths wide open as Professor Luckhurst spoke before his wife interrupted him. She asked: 'What are you frightened of you silly... what are you frightened of?' One of the students replied: 'What do you mean?' The rest of their exchange was inaudible but Mrs Luckhurst went on to repeat the word 'a***'. Mrs Luckhurst had explained the video left out the context of the chat in which the vicious students hurled insults at the couple. She said the 'baying' mob called her a 'b***h' and left her intimidated and frightened as they swarmed around them. After the event, Liddle slammed the university for its 'despicable' treatment of Professor Luckhurst and said they should 'reinstate him immediately to all his duties'. He also called for bosses to say sorry to him for 'vilifying' his speech which addressed trans issues, women's rights and institutional racism to 'appease jabbering infants' and said they should reimburse his PS150 travel expenses. It came after a group of Left-wing students staged a protest at South College calling for the professor to apologise for his wife's comments to them or quit. The baying activists gathered on a green with placards reading 'mansplain, manipulate, manwife' and 'we're queer, we're here'. Professor Luckhurst had angered them by shouting 'pathetic' when students staged a walk-out during Mr Liddle's talk - although he later apologised. Liddle told GB News last year: 'Let's start with what Durham University should do. They've behaved despicably, far worse than the students have behaved. 'I expected that from the students, I expected that from some of them. What you don't expect is the kind of double think which Durham University has indulged in. 'Firstly by saying that they agree with freedom of speech, then by saying except if it's something we don't agree with, which the Labour Party on campus doesn't agree with, then they don't agree with it. 'Then most importantly of all you might argue, scapegoating poor Tim Luckhurst who asked me to come along in good faith having cleared it with the university authorities having told them what was happening in advance. 'They have now decided because they've got to appease these jabbering infants they've decided they've got to do something and so a hugely distinguished, reputable and incredibly competent journalist and professor is left hanging out to dry. 'And so what they should do now, immediately, is number one, decide whether they believe in free speech or not. 'Number two, write a grovelling apology to Professor Luckhurst, reinstating him immediately to all his duties, and call off this fatuous investigation... 'And accept that he invited me here in good faith.  'And thirdly, what they should do after that is write me a letter of apology and explain to me they were wrong to have vilified me in their comments about this whole affair and they might be better off in future rather than teaching extra courses to their students in how to become prostitutes, a course in good manners might not come amiss. 'And they can also forward me 150 quid for my travel expenses because I came there free of charge with a wish to do the right thing to give something to public service, all that palaver.' He added: 'So they can apologise and reimburse my travel expenses and after that, I'll be happy.'",
  "9a2b0ea8e42e8a501c596718a51da0529219041dabdd8cadb28172bb": "Prince Andrew should voluntarily renounce his Duke of York title say councillors in the city after they voted unanimously to removed his Freedom of the City of York in the wake of his settled sexual abuse case.  The prince was branded 'an utter disgrace' during the extraordinary meeting to debate his Freedom of the City honour, which was awarded to him in 1987. After discussing the motion for around half an hour, councillors unanimously voted to strip him of the title. His continued clinging to the title Duke of York was described as as 'stain' on the city and councillors are now calling on the Queen, Palace or government to step in and strip him of the title if he refuses 'to do the right thing' and resign.  The council also noted objections from the public calling for the prince be banned from attending horse racing events in the city. Another said he should be referred to as 'Andrew Windsor' in the future. Andrew had been warned in advance that he would be losing the freedom of the city, an honour bestowed on him on February 23, 1987, as a wedding gift to Sarah Ferguson. He is the first person ever to have the Freedom of the City removed, councillors were told. There were two formal abstentions - from the Lord Mayor and Lord Mayor elect. Lib Dem Darryl Smalley, City of York Council's executive member for culture, leisure & communities proposed the motion and says he should also now lose the Duke of York title. He said tonight: 'The Honorary Freedom of York is the highest honour we, as a city, can bestow on those who represent the very best of York. The honour is held by many notable and accomplished people who carry it with pride and responsibly. 'Having been stripped of his military roles and royal patronages by the Queen, we believe that it is right to remove all links that Prince Andrew still has with our great city. 'I was pleased to see councillors of all parties support this motion and make it clear that it is no longer appropriate for Prince Andrew to represent York and its residents. 'The removal of this honorary title sends the right message that we as a city stand with victims of abuse. The next logical step is now for Prince Andrew to do the right thing and relinquish his Duke of York title. 'If he fails to do so, the Government and Buckingham Palace must step in to remove his title to finally end Prince Andrew's connection to York.' It follows a slew of authorities, institutions, schools and even golf clubs, which have all sought to distance themselves from the disgraced duke since he settled his civil case with Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking victim Virginia Giuffre.  In the wake of the case, which was settled in February, the 62-year-old was also stripped of his military roles and royal patronages and was told he would no longer be known as 'His Royal Highness'.  Both Buckingham Palace and a spokesperson for the Duke of York declined to comment. York City Council considered the motion: 'The Council resolves that, pursuant to Section 249 of the Local Government Act 1972, the City of York Council withdraws the Honorary Freeman of the City status from the Duke of York which was conferred upon him in 1987.'  The meeting at York Race Course started with an impassioned plea from York resident Gwen Swinburn, who is well known for her clashes with the council. She said: 'This motion could not have been any weaker. Mr Andrew Windsor is an utter disgrace. He brings shame and reputational damage everywhere he goes including to our city. 'The motion to withdraw his status goes nowhere near far enough. He needs to be declared persona non grata in York.' 'As we all know, he loves his horse racing so please agree to write to the race course asking he never be invited here,' she continued. 'That man casts a long shadow and our Queen has removed almost all titles and a responsibilities except his dukedom which stains this city. We need to do more than the easy bit, which is to remove his freedom.' Councillor Aisling Musson, for York Labour Group, added: 'This title damages the reputation of our city. We owe it to the people of York, in particular those affected by sexual violence, abuse or human trafficking. 'Our first duty is not to our reputation but their well-being and protection and remove this stain of association on our city which I am sure has weighed heavily on their minds - and may even have brought up pain and trauma they have worked hard to move past from.' Councillor Mark Warters added: 'While it is purely a symbolic act it does send a very strong signal from this city.' Councillor Martin Rolley, for the Tory Group, is also calling for a new watchdog awards sub committee to be set up to vet future suggestions for Freeman. York has a long history of freemen dating back to 1272. Freemen can claim their rights through patronage as far back as their great-great-grandparent. Once they are sworn in, freemen can join the Gild of Freemen who take an interest in the affairs of the city. New admissions are made every year. Back then, freemen were given control of city trade, city strays and rights of pasture. They were also given roles in running the city.  However, in modern times, they have no privileges in the city. You can still claim Freemanship through 'hereditary right' but it is also now possible to just apply for the tile by filling out an application form.   He added: 'I would like to challenge the council. The title dates back many many years. 'We want to ensure nobody receives a freedom of the city award as a result of a right of birth or standing in their community other than earned in the community.' Councillor Dave Taylor added: 'The motion has been very carefully worded to avoid any lurid allegations which would be difficult if not impossible to substantiate. 'However, I subscribe to the point of view that the Duke of York has shown a dreadful lack of judgment in his friendships with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. 'I hope in the future the Monarch might appoint the Princess Beatrice to be Duchess of York. In contrast to his father, she is personable, intelligent and does her homework and reads her briefing paper when visiting the city of York.' Councillor Denise Craghill, for the Green Group, said: 'It is highly inappropriate Andrew should retain the freedom of the city. 'It is highly inconsistent what we stand for as a city and would like the Palace and Government to take action to remove his title as Duke of York.' The Duke is the first VIP to be stripped of his Freeman status since Jimmy Savile, who had his taken by Scarborough Council in 2011.  The meeting in York had been scheduled to take place virtually last month but the plug was pulled just two hours before it was due to start following objections from Labour councillors.  The decision to cancel the initial meeting caused fury among councillors, but York Council's Lib Dem Group said the vote would go ahead on the same motion in April.  The spokesman said: 'The votes taken remotely would have been seen as recommendations and would have had to go to the Chief Operating Officer to be confirmed as decisions. 'Virtual meetings took place during Covid when the COO agreed with all the recommendations. It is purely because the agenda item on this meeting was very, very political. 'It was felt it would be better to hold it safely and properly in person once members were ready and healthy enough to attend. 'Quite a few councillors had recently tested positive for Covid and the real concern was many of them were vulnerable.'  Ahead of the cancelled meeting last month, Darryl Smalley, a Liberal Democrat councillor for York City, told the Independent: 'York's unique connection to the crown and the monarch is an important part of our city's legacy and history.   'However, as a council and city, we stand with victims of sexual abuse and are doing all we can to end violence against women and girls locally.  'As such, it is inappropriate that Prince Andrew retains his ambassadorial title that is intrinsically linked to our city.'  Mr Smalley had previously called on Prince Andrew to be stripped of his title. A survey by York's daily newspaper The Press found that 88 per cent of its readers want to see the prince's Duke of York honours taken away from him.   Phil Pinder, a retailer in the famous cathedral city told The York Press in February: 'York deserves better. He has been stripped of his royal duties; he has done a settlement out of court ending the prospect of any kind of legal clearing of his name so the only option is for him to permanently step down as the Duke of York as well. 'York deserves another royal to represent it instead.' He suggested the 'controversial' choice of Prince Harry, who lives in the US and holds the Duke of Sussex title.  There are also multiple petitions to remove the Duke of York honour from Prince Andrew.  One with 1,500 signatories says: 'Not only has 'Prince' Andrew demonstrated a lack of morals, lack of humanity and lack of judgement by protracted fraternising with Jeffrey Epstein, his recent interview confirms he lacks the ability to reflect, show insight and learn.  'Most importantly, it reveals a total lack of caring for others. 'These are not Yorkshire values. Having him associated with such a proud, fair and straight talking county is contradictory and embarrassing. Remove the title.'  Prince Andrew made his first public appearance since he withdrew from public life following his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was found guilty in 2021 of child sex trafficking, at the service for his father Prince Philip. The shamed royal insisted on accompanying the Queen from Windsor Castle to the thanksgiving event at Westminster Abbey. But to the shock of many in the congregation he then escorted his mother all the way to her front-row position - in full view of the live broadcast cameras. It had been expected that the Dean of Westminster would take the Queen to her seat, with Andrew behind. It was claimed the Queen 'personally paid PS2m to Virginia Roberts's charity' as part of Andrew's PS12m settlement. 'Stipulation of Dismissal' documents were filed with a court on March 8, with lawyers on both sides calling for the legal action to be dismissed, indicating the settlement has been paid. As the order was published, the Treasury confirmed no taxpayer funds were used for either the payment to Virginia Roberts or for the Duke of York's legal fees. A freedom of information request asked whether any money from the Sovereign Grant to the Royal Family or any other government money was used. The Treasury insisted: 'No public money has been used to pay legal or settlement fees.' The joint order filed with the New York court said each party would pay their own costs and fees.  There were reports the Queen or even Prince Charles contributed to the settlement by paying it or loaning him the money until the sale goes through of a PS17million Swiss ski chalet he owns with ex-wife, Sarah, Duchess of York. Mrs Roberts had sued Andrew for alleged sexual abuse. She claimed he had sex with her when she was 17 after he was trafficked by his friend, the late billionaire paedophile Epstein. The duke will make a 'substantial donation' to a charity for sex abuse victims set up by Mrs Roberts, now a 38-year-old mother-of-three. He said he now regrets his association with Epstein. Andrew, who was forced to step down from royal duties and public life as a result of the scandal, previously claimed he had no recollection of meeting Mrs Roberts and has always strongly denied her allegations. He agreed to the settlement in February.   A slew of authorities, institutions, schools and even golf clubs, have all sought to distance themselves from the disgraced duke since he settled his civil case with Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking victim Virginia Roberts.  In the wake of the case, which was settled in February, the 62-year-old was also stripped of his military roles and royal patronages and was told he would no longer be known as 'His Royal Highness'.
